It really did n't veer to far away from that . I think there was something like that a couple of the big enough revelations were that . Number one Kobe turned out to be the leaker you know that was some new information that week we did know about . That he was the one who decided to leak . Or tell predictably the contents of the memos to the New York Times . In the other little nugget that we got was that . He had concerns about attorney general of the lip .

I do n't know why would have been fired and hit it it took quite a minute to actually think about bet to really consider what he had been fired regardless . My guess prop it pretty . Joseph let me ask you about the tapes it you 're there in DC . And you know the president as saying you better hope there 's not tapes he says lord he hopes there is . Did they team do you know that president in the past taped conversations that go on in the Oval Office . Do you anticipate we 'll hear tapes .

The victims , Dr. Richard Field , 49 and Dr. Lina Bolanos , 38 were both prominent doctors in the Boston area . This was a gruesome murder where the couple was found with their hands bound and throats slit . It is not believed that Teixeira knew the couple directly although it is being questioned because he specifically went up to the 11th floor of that building and sought out their penthouse . The police were tipped off to go to the scene of the crime when a friend of Field 's received a text from him saying that there was a man with a gun in their apartment . Police responded at 8:38pm on Friday evening . Teixeira was wearing dark clothing and dark gloves . Police did have to open fire as Teixeira was opening fire on them upon arrival .

Comey may have painted President Trump as a liar but Trump is painting Comey as a leaker . They are filing a formal complaint with the Senate and the Department of Justice .

He was in Chicago on Monday to speak to a group of students about the radical change that took place in the 2016 election . He also went on to talk to students and young people about the effects of social media on your public image and career . He warned them to be cautious of the type of selfies they take. - <p> By the way , do you know how much former President Obama made for this public appearance ? He was paid $400K for this little chat . It 's predicted that he will make much much more as time goes on and he makes more appearances . He very well could be the most highly paid former president based on his age alone and the fact that he 's ' a young former president. - 
@@27160807 @860807/ 87346 @qwx287346 <h> James Comey 's Judiciary hearing reveils more than we expected <p> FBI Director James Comey , met with the Senate- Judiciary Committee in regards to Hillary Clinton 's private email server and the FBI investigation . Comey feels awful if he by any chance impacted the 2016 election with his choice to put out a letter on October 28th . He says he feels , " mildly nauseous " about it . He goes on to say put yourself in his shoes and what would you do . As we heard recently , 2016 presidential candadate Hillary Clinton spoke at a women 's conference claiming that she blames that letter for affecting her chances at winning . She said that " if the election were on October 27th , I 'd be your president " . - Her remarks clearly leaving the impression that that letter Comey came out with on the 28th is largely responsible for her loss . Comey had to answer to democratic leaders such as Dianne Feinstein asking him questions about why he came out publically with his investigation , " Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ normally , with no public announcement ? " . - James Comey , all in all claims that he has no regrets . He was merely doing what his job required him to do. - <p> What was surprising about Comey 's hearing yesterday was that he revealed a bit more information than we expected . He was questioned about Hillary Clinton 's right hand woman , Huma Abedin and her involvement with Clinton 's classfied emails . Comey admitted to the Senate Committee that Huma had indeed shared classifed material with her husband Anthony Weiner . Apparently she emailed him these documents in order for him to " print them out " for her . This raises a problem because one , she was sharing these documents with- someone ( even if it is her husband ) that she should not be sharing with and two , she is opening the possibility of those emails being hacked and intercepted by others by emailing documents to someone who is not authorized to receive them . Comey spoke out about Huma and her involvement more than he should have at this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now if she should be because of her handling of these classified documents . So should she ? Comey answers to the committee when asked if Weiner read these documents , that " he does not believe so " . Well , is he 100% positive ? He said they were not able to interview Weiner because of his recent criminal dealings . How can he be sure he did n't read these documents if he has not questioned him and can not confirm that ? - <p> In addition to Comey being questioned about his Oct. 28th letter and Huma Abedin , he was asked about former President Bill Clinton and former Attorney General Loretta Lynch 's sketchy meeting on the tarmac . Comey said that is was because of that meeting that he decided that he needed to seize control of the annoucement of Hillary Clinton 's email server investigation . That leaves us wondering , what was so alarming that was said on the tarmac that gave Comey the impression that he needed to take control of the announcement ? Comey was quoted saying , " and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the former attorney general Loretta Lynch who I like very much ... but her meeting with President Clinton on that airplane was the capper for me.

" Good , tough question off the top . - After DJT answered , Tucker then followed up , and here 's where he made his first BIG mistake . - Tucker pointed out that Trump paid in taxes in 2005 just under 25% , and he asked " is it fair " that Trump paid that when the average working man paid around 40%. - But this was not the time or place to debate the Buffett rule , no one cares about that right now . - The issue is Trump 's taxes . - What Tucker should have asked was " Mr. President , is 25% roughly what you have paid in recent years ? - Is it something close to that ? " - Because again , IF there is an issue here , it is what has Trump paid in taxes , not whether he pays less than his bellhops. - And if POTUS answered the better question with " well as you know I 'm under audit ... " , Tucker needed only to have said , " of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right ? " - What Tucker asked as his follow-up is fine , if you 're Rachel Maddow , but this is Tucker Carlson we are talking about , I expected better . <p> 2. - When the conversation got to wiretapping , again Tucker went softer than he normally does . - POTUS said to Tucker " I think you are going to discover some very interesting things coming to the forefront over the next two weeks " , and that was left there to hang as the show then cut to commercial . - Tucker 's focus on the whole wiretap discussion seemed to be more on whether Trump should be tweeting about the wiretapping , and whether Trump has any filters at the White House before he sends out a tweet. - But the question he missed was simple . - " Mr. President , based on your tweet , do you think your predecessor , Barack Obama , committed a crime against you , and if so , what should happen to him ? " - The discussion the two had on tweeting was fine , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sitting President , and Tucker let that slide , uncharacteristically . <p> 3. - Perhaps the most egregious mistake of the entire evening was this , the word " Russia " was not mentioned once during the entire 19 minutes that aired . - Regardless of whether you believe Trump is a Russia puppet , or whether Russia hacked the election , or whether Trump has secret business interests with Russia , Russia is one of the top 3 stories in Washington right now , has been since the election . - Tucker asked fifteen questions of the President in this interview , and not one was about Russia ? If nothing else , a simple " Mr. President , on a scale of 1-10 , how worried are you about the Congressional investigation going on about links between your administration and Russia ? " Or , Tucker could have asked " While many on the left question the wiretapping story because they see no evidence , and yet those same people continue to push a Russia connection story that also seems to lack evidence . Your thoughts . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not once . - It is hard to believe that in his preparation for this interview Tucker said to himself , " Eh , there 's just nothing to ask about Russia " , and yet that is what he did . <p> Look , none of this is to say I did n't like the interview , I did . - The interview was good , but this is Tucker Carlson we 're talking about , and good is not where the bar is for Tucker at this point . - I want great .

The crazy thing is that Comey found out while in LA and it came on TV . That 's how Comey found out that he was fired , someone pointed to a TV behind him that said he had been fired . Imagine that ! Comey thought it was a joke at first but it was not . He really has been fired . Members of the Trump administration have been out speaking on behalf on the firing and why it occurred . KellyAnne Conway , Trump 's former Campaign Manager and now a member of his administration was debating with Anderson Cooper over- the firing of Comey . Conway pressed that is was because of the letters from Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Duty Attorney General Rod Rosenstein that included the reasoning behind his termination and the way he treated Hillary Clinton during the 2016 campaign. - <p> Anderson Cooper among others were surprised by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Trump was praising Comey for what he was doing investigating Clinton and her classifed emails and server .

I had a very we were ritzy embarrassed sweep by embassies soiree at embassy party in Washington DC late last week . Kellyanne Conway was there . Where she was seen talking to Washington Post reporters . Somebody who was on the scene apparently a journalist or reporter . Began tool life tweaked underage you know a dummy account . Began poll life tweet everything that Kellyanne Conway was allegedly sank . And according to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talking about conversations she had with president trump . In particular .

He deliberately told her . I want you to go out and tell the media . Call me we 'll have to wait and see if the tapes exist . She US telling the reporters . I did n't wan na save not . I wanted to say instead no comment . In other words she 's implying she 's trying to saved the president from himself . She was bad mouth thing a couple of people . Within the Republican National Committee saying what do they do all day . Do they even you do n't if they get paid for this what do they do for all the money that they make .

Yakking it up with Washington Post reporters . Where they she was discussing private conversations she had with trump . And be where she was making fun or ridiculing . Some of his top people such as Ryan 's previous . She was also by the way implying . That all he cares about is where they can pronounce his first name properly when he 's dealing with reporters . And not the substance of the issue so she 's basically saying he 's a lightweight who 's a self absorbed eagle main . By the body . Yet just . On a side note apparently according to the Daily Mail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until July 4 Independence Day . To clean up the White House this function . Get this stuff .

I 've got pictures if you yakking it up with the Washington Post reporters you do seem extremely friendly with some . They seem to be very familiar with fuel and you seem to be very familiar with them . And so my question would be this . That is the way ranks talks in meetings . Were you making fun of rights . And when you when I talk in private I expected to not leave the room .

The plan could eliminate about $24,000 of income earned by a- newly married couple- and scale back your filing to be on only a single- page . As most know , taxes can be a pain and the sound of narrowing the details down to one page sounds a bit appealing to us . The tax form has not been confined to one page since 1935 . Then it had about 34 lines and only two pages of instructions . Where are we at now ? Present day , the 1040 form has about 79- lines and get this one , 211 pages of instructions . Talk about complicated ! No wonder people dread tax day among of course the fact of owning any money to the government ... anyone who can successfully file their own taxes without the assistance of a tax professional nowaways deserves an award . It 's not the simpliest of things to do , and as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Gary Cohn , the Chairman of the National Council of Executive Advisors himself even said that , " Americans spend nearly 7 billion hours complying with tax requirements each year and nearly 9 out of 10 of them ca n't file their own returns without help .

That Jared Kushner listen to this . How is about one billion dollars worth . Of loans . And financial topics one billion not million billion . To Goldman Sachs . And George Soros . Let me repeat dot . Jared Kushner . Cause extensive . Financial . And business ties including substantial loans . All of a totaling over a billion dollars just over a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The sugar daddy of the Democratic Party . ' cause the Wall Street Journal reveals . Jared Kushner is a coal owner of a real estate finance start up company called cadre . Cadre essentially in a nutshell . Helps to promote lucrative properties . To potential investors . And so either they help . Specific investors buy very expensive and lucrative properties or they have these investors put money in what 's called an investment fund . In which then caught Drake goes out and buys these very lucrative very expensive real estate properties and they get a huge feet . For getting on the you know obviously . The properties that are worth a lot on the market and will make their customers or clients even more money in the future . And so what 's what with the family business of Kushner it 's a family owned business . What they do it is they partnered with one of their friends . And they started up this company called cadre . However they needed a lot of investment capital to really get it off the ground @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United States . And so what they did was they went to Goldman Sachs . And Goldman Sachs says yeah we 're willing to partner with you were willing to give you guys a considerable amount of money off alone it 's . And not only Goldman Sachs . They then cautionary in particular . Reached out to George Soros is family business . And good old Georgie . ' cause he always places a bet on everything seek the thing about Soros is . He knows that there really influence American politics he not influence both sides . You put all your money on the Democrats and if they lose you 're in big trouble . This is what he 's done all across Eastern Europe this is what he does all around the world that 's why by the way he was helping to fund kasich 's campaign . That 's why he was taking money around to Paul Ryan . That 's why he 's been kicking around money to John McCain and Lindsey Graham . Soros does n't just give money to Democrats he gives money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Of over 215 . Million dollars . Took Kushner and cadre . In other words . Question is compromised . Pushed her in bed with Goldman Sachs . He 's in bed in fact with which Soros himself the double . And what crucial what does Soros want and what this Goldman Sachs want they want open borders . They want amnesty . They want free trade . Very exactly part of the donor class . That is the cause of all of the corruption in Washington . There you go . Could that be wide intense on and on site but could that be YE a Tonka came out . For the Syrian refugees there should be a discussion about that yes . Goldman Sachs wants to bring in Muslims and resettle them across the country . Date these are the people that want cheap labor . The are they are at the quintessential global lists . They want or race the border they wan na destroy American national sovereignty . And eventually they wan na destroy the middle and working class of this country that 's their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why he . Of course there is pushing behind the scene suitably and bring in more Muslim refugees gift 2500 . These listed these Afghan refugees . That 's George Soros Goldman Sachs may be . You know let 's all how Obama care obamacare . They wan na throw even more money towards pre existing conditions that 's Jared Kushner baby . Forget these findings Sanctuary Cities that 's Jared Kushner baby . A you are the wall come on mount you know you 've got your Border Patrol you 've . You built up some drones down there were were started . I deep pour illegal immigration is down over 70% . Come on dad . All build the actual wall come on it 's a symbol of racism owned blew it you see the Pope because the point is this . Sensors drones even Border Patrol agents . When the Democrats come back in power Horry global list Republican comes back in power you can pull that back . You can get rid of it . But to demolish a 2000 mile wall I 'm not saying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be very hard to do . That 's why that wall can not be built . That 's why the strategy is delayed delayed delayed delayed . And before you know what your four years are up and there 's no wall . And then your base revolts . Are you could potentially become a one term president . So the question now is this . Why is Lisa animal . Who clearly now has very deep economic and financial interest in ties he 's compromised . Which the arch enemies of trump Goldman Sachs was all in for Hillary Clinton . She in fact was the candidate of Goldman Sachs . George Soros is the arch . Enemy of Donald Trump . And your son in law 's doing business with them . And I do n't just mean you know what I understand in business you 're the do n't the coasters are also extremely wealthy . I 'm not talking a 1000002000003 . Million whatever in that world the way people run in those circles . They intermingle okay I 'm talking a billion dollars . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't care how wealthy you wore a billion is still a billion is a billion that 's a lot of clams baby . That 's all auto mall law as they say . So who is best interest as he really have a heart . Because I look it is New York liberal democratic background . And that has n't changed . I look at who he 's voted for all of his life Jared Kushner . Now I look Wii 's doing business with now I remember these are loans they own you man . He 's not lending out to them . They 're lending helping him . They 've got them by the you know what . He told them they do n't owe him . And this guy has the president 's ear every day . On every assignment like he gave him a certain project or certain past . He 's a senior advisor . He 's Karl Rove to bush that 's what he is that 's he 's been promoted to anyway . Oh every day when I read that Wall Street Journal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ball . You all starts to make suits . That 's what 's really going on behind the scenes . And so the waved a left . And the wave of global lists and the wage George Soros . Managed to infiltrate the trump administration . Was n't just your Ryan extremists . And it was n't jurors through Paul Ryan Orion . I mean this I got ta say for Soros I got to give him his due dates are this is pretty Machiavellian . Fairness . This is pretty diabolical . But it 's Smart . You do n't like the double it 's clever it 's coming . With a family . But not through the sons or their daughter because I do n't think they Trump 's would go for that . What she 'd do it through the same animal . Really you lawless . Now . To me I 'll tell you this right now . And I do n't care I normally take a lot of heat for this but I got ta say that not to means a blatant conflict of interest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the United States with all due respect . And you got substantial financial and business interest including major lawns . To an America hater like George Soros . And to Goldman Sachs . Which is a transnational corporation that wants a new world order in fact it 's the major backer of the new world order . You have no business working a White House and you have no business especially being . The president 's senior advisor I do n't care who signed a law you are I do n't care whose brother you are I do n't care who signed you are I do n't care was first cousin you are . Look you may be the greatest sign a law on the history of the world Gordon new York and run your business . But this guy has no business being in the Oval Office . Or being in the White House and certainly not having trumps year . And so my strong advice now the president is this . You wan na save your presidency . Do you really want to make sure you achieve the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ta do to thinks . You 've got to push for Ryan to go and be replaced as I point out in my column by somebody who 's principled and honest . Someone like congressman Jim Jordan . Okay and the second one . You 've got to have an intervention . I 'm sorry it 's time for a family meaning it 's time for finally sit down . I say look Jared you 're really good Osmond you treat my bunker really well . I love you as a son in law . Let 's watch a baseball together let 's watch football together I wan na play with the kids you know me I 'm granddad I love to be what they 've moved a little much against . But Jared your Forte is business it 's not politics . Sorry you when he Monica . You got to move out . You 've got to go back to Manhattan . At the posts . Are you troubled . By Jared Kushner is deep financial and business ties to Goldman Sachs and a double himself . George Soros .

Stronger together in the middle somewhere was I would hurt . And you know even people inside the campaigns . I 've still been no what she was turning foreign she 's just become the inevitable candidate again in the end . Yeah she it seems to be you know she never knew she was running from and I think you guys and even so this is shoot running for Bill Clinton 's third term when she wrote for Barack Obama 's . You know who what exactly was she what was she doing out there let me ask you about this guy 's Ewing cover . A little bit more about the email scandal and you tribute back to the 2008 campaign . Bird flu in 2008 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out what to do on long term campaign . She cast one of her aides . She who are basically down will be emails of of first senior aides to shoot good . Get a better understanding of who was talking to the press who was backstabbing and saying bad things about her . She one of her . Sorry the source who assembled the Glover and do n't purposes such as well as mr . Ripley . Figure out who was disloyal . What 's amazing because it is . You do n't you calm . Come from for a few years solutions wrongful former president . And we have the female server should the state to program that you basically New York human . But she does n't really understand how operations system 's slow you know remote dirt basically she did this for convenience and it was n't really an attempt to get revel rules . And and yet we know that she 's spent a lot of time going through all the people you 've also looks so pretty good idea of what it would forward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go through hole you know I 'm not able to get information from State Department under through your preparation are for forest which is really look and sound were principally the public suppose diplomacy would your fault or your records are or your secretary of state . She felt something more that could n't happen . Would you know we believe our mission which you did after the 2008 campaign which were joking of course I am the spoke of the she 'll pretty good understanding of what do reach some of the Austrian else . She just went to make sure nobody did to her what she had done two others . You do that so what were important . And I thought I thought I do n't doubt he would confess I believe . Elizabeth Warren she is someone we all know we 're just DL are sitting here with me knows her all too well and is considering a run against her she . If Hillary Clinton had one . And Sheikh . Almost gon na Miller vice president . Yeah we we indeed held out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her seriously . In the hands that now we 're all I 'm more seriously than everyone thought . And she was looking Herbert EP app and levee keep experiment was n't really thrilled by the what thought that there are . They locked a little I do n't know they were a little Q conventional . It 's in the dot org starting with what continue . I 'm you know it 's I think the sleep a bit cautious protect . But yet that we we keep telling about how she really did consider what this for an academy and file like . There 's style led a class . Men and did n't wan na go to her . He was interesting was Bernie Sanders I think was a 22 states he ended up winning during the primary . And he was more of an ideological sort of paring with Elizabeth Warren if if you know you ask me . And you know it again I might have helped shore up some of the states that she ultimately ended up not going back to visit or . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right any so that that will do warned they could have actually helped put her over the top . Yeah but it I think a lot of people internally felt like I could beat you Ricky Q women on the ticket and bold about saying . You know we are all according to start character or incur you know it 's basically . It was Q risky for eleven and she did n't . A very processed first and she does n't like him except see the students who likes to come in prepared and so I think that was a little too much for the campaign says things I just . Well you guys also said that she was kind of looking for governing partner and Elizabeth Warren may not have seen the world the same way they she got . That 's right there 's the blue . We were sort of told that the eastern we 're not going to close with Warren was . That . If there was not enough of a background of assert transactional history there had n't done enough . A walk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reputation for for being a thorn in the side of even her own friends even even President Obama console should go Q was . We 're creatures separate storm armed . Thanking them and finance the Austrian . Who you who put his administration . And so I think those factors it 'll hurt should be not entirely convinced it was lukewarm would have driven . You know essentially picture earlier as well as president . You know any you mentioned earlier that status of a lack of a reason to run for Hillary Clinton there she could n't convey I guess the message as to why it was important to elect terror . But if if he won the other things your book talks about is is really more of an indictment of the culture inside the beltway that . DC is having a tough time figuring out how to connect with the rest of America . And and and what they need to do to govern so this is also a book about the bigger picture as well all right .

When she turned to figure out what 's happening with electorate does n't quite get it basically focus not just like edge I ca n't . I I do n't understand I ca n't wrap my arms around . Which I thought that Laura mr. appealing Norman LaMont has . The issue is there were that you are popular than happening . She thought with Bernie Sanders that kind of followed her in here with the general election this year idol term . And he never quite got it . Yes it years some sort of prepare for those that people people alternately wanted to achieve its candidate and I 'm . And they did n't want the same old same old man and that ca n't interpret but the fact that she could n't really understand . What was happening I think what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ couple of the kind of day DL the juicy details number one you guys revealed that she had to call . President Obama and that she apologized .

Not all not all that 's okay oh yeah I have to banning hate speech . You have to ban conservative speech . David Horwitz shut him up . David . And Coulter shut her up . Bill O'Reilly shut him up Charles Murray that professor that they silence that Middlebury College shot him up . But Steven called bear no problem . Okay it 's the First Amendment and it 's on brought its its broadcast television @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not in some private room . Or at a University College short college or university campus . This is on the cross the public airwaves that are supposed to be regulated by the Federal Communications Commission . There are obscenity standards . There are basic standards of decency that broadcasters have to abide by . It 's bull wall . And you allow that smarty got garbage . And not only do you allow whipped which you 're throwing it in our faces how proud your . And now this guy they 've turned to sky just some kind of a liberal hero . My France . K enough is enough enough is enough . So if the liberals want to play their boy card game . Here 's what I think all of us now should do okay could CBS obviously backs them . The liberals backed him the media backs him Paulie would box him he 's not budging . Every single one of his advertisers and sponsors should be boycotted . We should go after him where it hurts the money . And maybe just maybe . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the presidency . And insulting to viewers and the people of America . 6172666868 . Col Baer refuses to apologize . Your reaction . Next KL. 150 here on the great WR KOK this is from 617 . Jeff can we send Steven called Bayer to North Korea . Even the north Koreans would n't day come back I. Did you seek Kim Jung on you at all funny at all funny at . Okay my friends . Look to me what 's incredible is this . Here you have the very same liberals . Who went to Washington DC with their ridiculous . And going on about president trump and how trump is not fit to be president and because he used the and that was in a paper . That was in a private conversation . On a bus that was recorded on tape . This guy says something even more seeing . On a public airwaves . Violating FCC regulation in the book . And the liberals are saying trump is disgusting and vile and despicable and Stephen cold air is averaging Euro . He 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the guy you listen to know this is the guy you find funny . But it shows you how unhinged . How literally unhinged . The liberals and the left have become . Listen to this story okay because it 's much bigger than Steven Cole there is n't this . So it 's now come out member boys feet do n't want these big liberal media outlets . They pushed a fake golden showers do n't CA about trump which turned out to be complete bogus fake news well listen to this okay . Now they found out if in their social media when they were exchanging comments are messages to each other . They were actually joking . About assassinating . Trump . This is what they think it 's funny they think calling for this guy to be killed this is for them now this guy that 's a barrel laughs for them . So in one exchange . The web sites director of social media Macy 's shorten . Actually wishes for Trump 's assassination . And her coworkers are laughing and cheering her on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what she writes I 'm one of these dumb on why these social media sites . And the other one always annoyed . OK . Okay . Or our colleagues are like . I agree with you laugh out loud let 's do away it . You know we 'd love to do it and we join you . I mean this this is the stuff that these people find funny . Big big big find joking about shooting and killing the president that 's funny . Murdering him that 's funny . So if you want to know why . I can needs very obvious . Because when you talk about that survey which is part of our poll question . What is now everybody 's just camp believe that tension is actually increase the pork . And why is it increased report . Because now Americans are even more stressed and anxious about politics . And what 's more shocking about the survey result does this new survey out we 're talk about it to a five and some greater detail . But there 's a new survey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anxiety and tension at the workplace they fought jury the election campaign . And then to their shock and horror . Actually people are now even more stressed and more anxious when they discussed politics . Especially political philosophies I you are you pro or against Strom . Now after the election . Then before the election . It is in fact sold bad . That one quarter of all American workers are now saying it directly negatively . Impacts their ability to work . This is how bad it 's getting at the workplace . And that in fact 15% . A full 15% . Have actually seen . Call leaks get into a heated argument or an actual fight over politics . And what 's more shocking a hole . Is that jury in the election campaign according to these polls . This survey . That liberals conservatives Republicans Democrats . Were affected . Pretty much the same . They all said yeah I 'm feeling more stressed I 'm feeling more anxious I 'm for Hillary I 'm for trump I do n't like Hillary 's people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same . But what now changed dramatically . Is that many more liberals are feeling anxious and stressed at work over politics . Then conservatives . According to his bowl . Harris poll 38% . Liberals 21% . Conservatives . And I 'll tell you what the reason it 's . It 's obvious I see each year . An intercom I see here a WRKO . The liberals are melting down over trump . Days so hit them . They sold despise them that there are becoming unhinged derby coming deranged . And so whether it 's Stephen cold air . Saying the most obscene vulgar things whether ridge journalists now openly joking about assassinating and killing the president . Whether it 's riding on campuses . Whether it 's silencing Ann Coulter or conservative speakers are trump supporters . Whether it 's constant hate mail . Whether whatever it is at the office . People now wo n't talk to me . I never did anything I just I just sent hard oil Mike I have no interaction with them . The moment they found out I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to even worse now than before the election . They will now look the other way now I do n't care . I 'm not whining in my complaining . I 'm just do n't . How low and they say enough for models like nothing . They do n't say anything onsite and it 's OK all live . They 're becoming unhinged . They 're so becoming so one pinched . That they 're furious . Then if you start talking politics in the workplace these liberals are gon na completely mobile . I 'm telling you that 's what 's going on . They 're gon na start ranting and raving yelling and screaming . Swearing and cussing . Shouting obscenities and for families are . And to me it 's it 's pretty obvious Dutch ladies lives are so stressed that work not because trump is driving him crazy but more than that moved . Always trump supporter and I. More than a little more I 'm gon na tell him he 's a blank hole serve his mouth is only good for one during football @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deplorable . Good good Dominique Dominique Coleman . And so now I kid you not it 's gotten so bad . Burnout is up . There is so much stress absences are up . People do n't wan na come to work now because they find out McCauley does that trump supporter or whatever did they can handle . We can handle it or vice Versa you have some supporters . Were feeling so discriminated against and persecuted direct are n't I just do n't wan na get up in the morning and and put up this garbage . They 're not judging me as a colleague anymore they 're judging based on my politics and my my political affiliations . And so this still means what 's happening now in our workplace . Is becoming Scholl politicize . That would liberals are now doing is they are actually poisoning the workplace . Much is for conservatives . They 're starting to poisoned it for themselves . I just making him miserable . I mean think about it to deliver Iran to like about your Lucious go back the cold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the maturity and the intellect of a fifth grader if you think that 's funny in all honesty OK but let that go . You 're really not malicious . But really you 're that hate filled . I. I mean really you you you you you your your that angrier that it be and if I mean honestly you must be a miserable human beings . If you have got much hate in your heart imagine working with this guy . Prove her . Not at all they want I would feel stressed and anxious and burn out coming to work we 're about left wing lunatic . Okay my friends 6172666868 . Paul bear refuses to apologize . How do you face discrimination . Or anxiety or stress at work because of your politics . Next . We are . You know after all of this . After all of this . Agassi in what is happening you know Iowa and around the country . After seeing this log collapsing . While we waited sit across the country . Knowing all this turmoil that is coming . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the date that we 're going to do that . Today this child has the opportunity . To do more to do more than just fulfill a promise . We have the opportunity to raise our gaze . And setting full course for our country . That was house speaker Paul Ryan about fifteen minutes ago . In his concluding speech . They 're now getting through a couple of preliminary votes . And soon they will be actually doing a vote on the health care bill itself . There are supposed to buy about 1 o'clock it 's now 205 . So far it 's and we do n't know though actually vote by 3 o'clock so this may actually happen and take place during how we show . Baba we 'll let you know if they do vote before and oh what the implications and the consequences are well they are doing for Liz Lauren to email her go from Chicago . I. Senator Rand Paul has now spoken out he says it 's a good bill now not a great bill . But a good bill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more in this and it . I 'm look I just wan na say this my friends . It 's clearly an improvement I think there 's no question about it from Ryan care from what they were proposing just a couple months ago and the reason why is . It takes a lot of health care back to the states . And it allows the skates . By giving them waivers . To essentially bust . Or break . The obamacare mandates . So by doing the fact much of the repealing of obamacare will take place at the state level . It 's not a complete repeal but it goes a long way towards repealing obamacare . And so that 's why I think it should have the support of all conservatives I believe in the house the house freedom caucus says they 're gon na about it . Trump apparently now has been making some very last minute phone calls . But unlike Ryan he knows how to you know he knows how to persuade people he knows how to deliver votes . And so he has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appears she may have convinced or persuaded enough to get this 216 . Votes necessary . So we 're gon na find out . If it passes this will be a momentous moment . Because it now means we are now finally on the role too getting rid of the monstrosity . That is obamacare . It is not . The you know it 's not the beginning of the end but it 's the end of the beginning . And it will go to the senate . And eventually within a couple of months Obama care will go and be swept into the dustbin of history so we shall see okay . 61720666868 . Is the number . Political talk . There is now AG a survey that everybody 's talking about . It is sponsored by the American psychological association 's center for organizational excellence . And according now to this poll to their shock their very surprised . Full and part time workers . This poll conducted between February and march of 2017 . Found that a majority of Americans . I have discussed politics on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surprising . Is that anxiety . The feelings of negativity . Of stress . Some of constantly feeling emotionally pressured . Or of arguing are squabbling with politic about politics at work . That this is actually increased since the election and has n't decreased it 's actually increased . And 40% of American workers now say . That exchanging political views especially when it comes regarding political philosophy . I eat are you pro or against trump . Has led to negative outcomes . They say it 's led to fighting in the office . Or up or work quality . Harder to get work done . People start disliking each other especially coworkers based on their political views . This is leading to higher levels of stress . Harassment at work feelings of burnout . Inability to do their job . Many people feel that they 're just so . Persecuted because of their political views . That they 're not even coming to work or their rates have apps of absentee rates have now gone up . And miss surprising part is . That it 's now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of liberals say that now they find they 're feeling extremely anxious and very stressed . When even talking about politics at work only 21% . Of conservatives . And I explained my theory in the last segment . I think it 's obvious . They are sold he ranged in unhinged I he AK a Stephen cold air . That you mention trump they see red . You mentioned trump . They start hyperventilating and you mentioned trump they start getting a sour stomach . There Derek Derek der der der nerves there their muscles start tightening up . And so they 're afraid if they 're gon na explode . Or get into a very heated argument . And so they would just rather shut it out there are not even have a mentioned . They so hate him that anybody or any thing that is said positively about the president will trigger . An immense negative or hateful reaction . Now let me just say this . I certainly felt that since the election . I felt injuring the campaign but boy ever since the election because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and displays here is very liberal . Vary liberal . Getting a W we share or same building would WGBH . We have people who work above us below us . They never thought trump was gon na win . So I mean behavior nominee was a deplorable and erases them a big hit an almost full and Islam phobic and yadda yadda yadda . And all of his supporters work . But they never thought I was gon na win . Because they believe the fake news media . Now that he won they ca n't handle it can handle it . So so far it 's only been limited to whom they do n't wan na look at mean they do n't wan na talk to mean they do n't wan na say I do n't mean day . You can feel the tension is there 's no question about it there is . Spansion . And so my question do you is this . Have you faced . Persecution . How do you face insults . Have you been harassed at work or do you feel a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at work and especially because . Of your support of Donald Trump . ' cause this made your life at work . Works . And let 's even broaden it socially . Has Brady talked about that among her friends among people that she notes . Suddenly you 're trump supporter . They start swearing match you they do n't wan na be your friend anymore they start or you do n't remember verbally abusing you . In other words you really see the intolerance of the left . Even among your friends and you thought you guys here and you thought you were friends and then before you know it politics and trump is more important than your friendship . Okay the corner country poll question of the day sponsored by bill Kelly financial services . And how do you ever suffered anxiety or stress . Because of politics at work . If the answer is yes decks the letter they could 68688 . I 'm a big eight to be honest . All right guys is Brittany .

Gerry and Cape Cod Europe first go ahead Jerry . Kept it afternoon happy national prayer day view . Do you like to mention something about that afterwards the Japanese . I can personally say I worked myself so I do n't feel it . But I 've talked to friends of mine . These certain is human resources to send memos around at work with certain corporations . Not to discuss any of it on work time . There I agree with you Jerry and I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is part of the political correctness in Indian cultural marxists in the being injected into everything . Did you . I 've got a C three friends and three relatives that do n't speak to my wife and I anymore . Because of our political beliefs . But waited . Chip on their national day of prayer it 's true but president trump did at a ceremony at the White House . But I believe he is wrong about Islam and Saudi Arabia that they will not be our partners in destroying Islam as some . The other part based responses that . And the other fund all the mosques and madrassas worldwide . And also jets something very disturbing new US Department of Education . The have a program called accept Islam in grades K through twelve produced spike PP yes and funded by the saudis . Jerry I mean I 'm not surprised and thank you for that call look I think trump is making I 'll get to that 's another topic for another day . I know his first foreign trip this coming up he 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . To mean the saudis are not are our friends there are enemies but that 's another topic for another day . Brittany I 'm just curious . Have you lost friends because of your support for trump . Now I have not . My friends are Bernie supporters and a couple of friends of Bernie supporters . We never really argued about it she just put her plants why should I attempt . I put my points . Why I like to few Republican candidates . And we just do n't we do n't really get into move political talk . You know we always grab dinner . And we never really get into it we and if there is an issue coming up she usually just . We 'll ask me questions you know since I as you do n't know a lot about politics of what 's going on and turn events just asked me had a couple of questions and we agreed to disagree means talks focus multiple times together and we 're not gon na lose our get really close friendship over politics is just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so we disagree on politics . And and that 's it and that 's all right . So no I did not feel like if anything I I gains more and more friends . After this election . That 's interest and okay I mean I 've I 've lost friends over this election . I got ta tell you right now I 've lost a lot of friends . Are some family member or members of cut off complete ties with me . It 's very sad . And what it is is this okay what it boils down to . The Gerri touched on it about political correctness marxism . Which seeks to politicize everything . What the left beliefs . Is that if you support from your racist . I eat your evil . Pure evil . We believe if you supported Hillary you 're just misguided it . Not to put that is most extreme may be school prayer or whatever you do n't know that you do n't know the facts you do n't know much about her . You do n't you do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the Clinton foundation whatever . We just think you 're wrong and misguided . And at worst ignorant about what 's going on at worst . Big genuinely believe worry able . Now if this is the way you think of this is how you view the world how can we get along . Mean I 'm sorry I mean to be sol Rio apocalyptic but it is just it 's a fact . If you do n't whatever curry knew that may be a lot of people who voted for trump did so for very real concrete decent reasons . They ca n't get that through their skulls . They ca n't get it through your tickets . And sold this is why . They demonized not only trump but all of his supporters . And Indian and I 'm telling you what it 's going to do is is going to care apart at the very fabric of our country . Because with people like that you ca n't reason with logic . You ca n't reason with them with facts or evidence because they 're driven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And hatred . The other point is . To me I do n't tip if I 'm if I 'm an employer . I 'm not paying for you to talk politics . You know to discuss the issues at work . I 'm paying for you to do your job . Now you want talk politics . Gore happy hour gore or restaurant . Go to war bar what ever get your own talk show . But if you 're at work as an employer . I 'm expecting . You to do your job I do n't want this to turn and do whatever I firing line . Or whatever you know what a Fox News debate or whatever I want you to focus on what I pay you for I do n't pay you for your political opinions . Keep that out of the office . I expect you to do what I ask you do and what your job is in other words do your job . Period full stop as my grandfather would say okay my friends . It 's now official .

God was close my friend it 's almost no cigar but they did at . 217 . Votes . Every single Democrat voted against the bill . One . Britney 's gon na try to find out exactly who those when he Republicans are . But essentially there are mostly I believe moderates . It was the conservative house freedom caucus . That port Isabel over the pop . Around Paulus come out and said he thinks it 's a good bill they 're gon na change the improvement they think significantly in the senate . Now it is the beginning of the end . Of obamacare. 6172666868 . Will discuss this at 235 I promise . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there that are on the line . Have you felt stress at work . Have you felt more anxious because of politics at work Kathy in Rochester go ahead Kathy . I am I the only little bit and I do a lot of small business owners so I do n't I do n't get too annoyed because the majority of people but I feel ripped morale on the same page . There are conservative they all quote pick Donald Trump they all . Could not stand Obama so luckily we are on the same page and when I came across some of the wife and I just would got got subject like a hot potato . The thing that annoys me more aid that you particularly have agreed to vital but not be fooled into thinking specifically invited to Donald Trump because it 's not that great divide is due to Obama . He is the one who . Is creating an aspect I. Think it did it 's not it 's more frustration I think that a lot of conservatives feeling we just so frustrating because . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In these people who are liberals they believe they get in Egypt company ever question . I think this is this true it is on it 's true that it 's really what 's happening and it 's frustrating because they do n't think he was happening . Did n't sell Bolivia . You know and myself I have an unknown goal of their . You know holy roller Christian Catholic to go to church every single date and yet they 're liberals and how can you feel liberal . And deploy partial birth abortion and Planned Parenthood . And you know allowing Muslims want to kill Christians coming into the country left and right . It it to me it 's more total frustration . Kathy very well set . And you do n't notice . There are ideologues . That 's the difference . We look at experience we look at reality . We try to build our lives and our thinking and our views based upon history experience reality . For them ideology . Dole left ism socialism . It trumps everything . Russ in Boston @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a stream liberal that are right in martz you think I 'm not terribly because there 's just like banging your head up against a wall .

You know I have I have a lot of it was sort of those fights I have a lot of the liberal acquaintances such an obscure web Brooks friends steady and you know you just do n't they are because it 's a waste of time . Ressam with you I mean really I got that 's what I 've learned . I mean I have little liberal colleagues who are just a small point . I mean is like arguing it 's like arguing with the wall a different expression I always used its better to argue with the wall than it is to argue with them . Logic does n't persuade him Evan is does n't persuade him facts does n't persuade them so eventually hopefully reality . You know just comes you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they for war I was wrong all those years that 's it that 's all you can know . Okay my friends . That house passes barely but they passed their Republican health care bill . Obama care is now on its way into the dust bin of history . Yes .

Ambassador Bolton thank you so much for coming back on the corner report . All regretted it Gartner . Ambassador I 've got to ask you straight out . What did you make of president Trump 's decision to fire James call me good move bad move . Well I thought it was the right decision substantively and I I only criticism did say it was that he did do it on January on . Because the grounds on which the our income place that is to say how many egregious ambling . Hillary Clinton email . Problems was all done in public . Everything was known on the quiet January and and I just like it would have been better cleaner to do it dead right now . It 's gotten in matched in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the truck administration .

It was all about the greater glory of Jim company and aunt and the FBI the armed by so I think I think our . Hurley the right yeah . Obviously was breaking this morning ambassador is the tweet by president trump . About call these leaks to the New York Times in their big front page story today . Where by associates of combing your claiming it was Strom Peru requested that dinner . It was strong wanted call me to pledge personal loyalty to him if he did that he would keep his job . Call these associates are claiming basically the second coming of Eliot mess . They you want to stand for the honor an independence of the FBI . And he could just promise him that he would be an honest and fair FBI director . And that ultimately this is the reason why trump fired him he wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person directing the FBI . Trump is now to weed out . Sing call me better hope that there were not quote unquote tapes of their conversations . Because apparently what he 's leaking to the press the president is saying is not true . Let me ask you this . Do you believe that the conversations were taped . And is it wrong for the president to be taping conversations . That he 's having with people within the administration . Well I do n't I do n't think it 's wrong for the president taped conversations was n't armed and what did jobs in that it even before Richard Nixon and the famous . Watergate case I think history . Benefits from having it execute never sat well with any of the Nixon tapes not I think it 's still only available the archives that . I remember years ago by advocates of Lyndon Johnson . And his meetings and on calls on national public radio hour after hour or weekend . And a driving around doing mine that we get here I thought it was absolutely fascinated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that those conversations would have been great . Look I do n't I do n't know whether the president paid the conversations or not or whether it is . Just just playing tweet tweet tweeting one upmanship with comic . I think the leaks simply seen all of Baptist right along our . Evidence of real doozies in Washington should disease one law enforcement agencies leak it to disease intelligence agencies sleek . Washington has been going downhill for decades on this and we 'll probably at a at a low point here again today . I do n't think anything unusual for president ends meet with the director of the FBI in fact if anything has its custom . Merry at the beginning of a a new president 's term . And Andy the idea that . Somehow or another . There 's evidence . Trumps collusion with the Russians which of course must justify why he wants it 's our . The FBI director this is supposition . Based on supposition as there 's any evidence . I 'm surprised it has n't leaked already but frankly all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away is the president would quickly announces . Nominations . For commie successor . Senator Mike Lee if you saw an eight . I think game extraordinarily . Clever move has recommended Eric Garland who Obama nominated to the Supreme Court never got it here . I think that would clear her seat for trumpet so on the DC circuit which is like such clever move . But the idea of this sitting judge her former judge somebody who 's been out of the political . Maelstrom for awhile has been used or judge Webster . Has the FBI . Then went on to be the head of the CIA . I would recommend Joseph Lieberman 's former democratic senator from Connecticut . Ray Kelly . The F former police commissioner New York has been recommended . I think there are a lot of good choices hope the president takes one of them and I hope he does it today years here there after because he picks . As a person of known integrity . Public reputation for honesty and character . And put that person detergent the FBI . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disappear there 's nothing Bayard . I that as I thank him and let somebody comes up with evidence rather than just . As being a he had ever trapper . I think we 've got to put this that line where the other . Ambassador speaking of leaks . I know Matt Drudge is now openly complaining saying he 's never seen anything like this . Eight years under Obama they could n't get one leak from one staffer . Under trump Drudge is saying look if they 're willing to leak to mean almost won an hour . I can tell you ambassador of good very good sources with the trump White House . Biggest wan na talk . It 's unbelievable how the New York Times you read the times to the Washington Post they 're citing official after official after official . But within trumps inner circle he 's got a major problem now is no longer leaks it 's almost a flood . And so my question to you is this what does a president do . We 're not even talking now about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so called deep state . Now we 're talking about people . Around him his top advisors . People he should be trusted the notion of the trust of he should be trusting . And instead they just wan na keep throwing the president under the bus what does the president do . Well you know that this that this is a very serious problem I agreed this early in the administration have this many leaks instead of focusing on . The substance of what . A tribe needs to accomplished to get reelected twenty torn into keep republic of majority in the house and the senate . You know you have to wonder if some people doing the leak are . And I truly loyal to the top administration or whether their oil to something else and I worry that those people who who . Who were n't really in the thick of the fight he getting the nomination . And getting elected . Are are just preparing another line item entry on their Reza . About how they they were somehow in the administration would not the administration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ task but I think the president . As the saying they 're very hard . Who really is in his administration as opposed to people are just kind of there . To prepare for their next I think that 's the ball where the leak is coming crowd that would be my guess . Ambassador are Norah against that in terms of time but I 've got to ask you this question you opened up a very big door and I think which are sings a 1000% correct . I look at somebody like you in all candor . Who was not in never trump her . He who were on the trump train almost from the beginning you were loyalists who gave him great foreign policy advice . You were there battling alongside him in the trenches . And yet I do n't CU running the National Security Council . I do n't see US national security advisor I do n't see you and a serious major pop our administration position . Why is this president decided to reward people . Who were against him . At least during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and people like you eminently qualified . Who were easy or how his back from almost day one . And he seems like he 's forgotten his friends and he 's rewarding his enemies . Well I do n't I do n't really think that 's what he 's doing I must say obviously . I I was hoping above all the there 're a couple of very listen to their work out . But I do n't hear any Greg yours too against the president or anybody in the administration . I think our job is just that . Comment on policy and what I think is is right what I think is wrong and I expect great . One of the things that the administration is experiencing is . Our common from the business world where . That it simply agree then that Couric 's future performance that it is say are you making body . It forms something that lit courses everybody in the right direction in early personal animosity rivalries in addition what . Everybody shares a common interest and I think it 's buried . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hank Paulson when he came to . Be Treasury Secretary wrote in his memoirs tell Al he was that not everybody in Washington worked together . Which for an old Washington hand like me is sort of what you get out and read the newspaper every morning and I think the administration 's going through still through the shake out period with . So with that in mind and I I think the presidency clearly . What his detractors are in certainly in many the national security area . And I I think that . You know the personnel decisions will reflect that in due course that 's not . Ambassador is it time for Sean Spicer to go . Does the president need to shake up this communications team because they 're they 're getting killed out there by the media . Yeah well I do n't I do n't really know if where where where they 're responsibility lies here in the senses I read in the newspapers . Spicer is doing his naval reserve . Active duty obligation and that it 's it 's hard to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't . Really understand why . On a Tuesday or Wednesday whatever day it was they did n't have come firing that Jeff Sessions and deputy attorney the attorney general deputy attorney general rob rose steam work available . To Greece in the White House briefing room . Rosen Steve memo on what probably did wrong with the Clinton email . Matter is that powerfully Britain and and relatively brief three page document . That always the case out cold sessions with his cover recommendation on top of and I think the two of them Greeks in the press . As the decision was announced would have been great they could sit on that . The evening talk shows all the way around . Senators could have been called the ban I I I do n't know what the explanation is that . But look at they were ever gon na get a fair hearing on it anyway how bad . As I 'm sure you know you probably talked your listeners about Maxine Waters . Democratic congresswoman saying well we 're inside accelerates our companies just not sign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ media 's attitude we 're you know as well I 'd do it she had been elected art they say they . Literate honor their loved her fort . Yeah absolutely we 're now seizure elected while now ambassador to try to turn him into the second coming of Eliot mass . You know this is this is . Look at comedy has always looked out for himself I 'm not saying he 's not a good lawyer right and it is dedicated public servant . But but this is this is really the damage that he did the FBI . By his is desire to be in the spotlight still ca n't be calculated . And I do n't think the damages over . I think if you just look for example at what the acting director of the FBI testified yesterday . And here 's somebody whose wife was a fundraiser for the democratic governor of Virginia . The acting director mr . McCabe said there had not been and any request . That he knew increase resources at the FBI and the pressure investigation he said we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resource . You know that 's another central element of a speculation there was just one way yes it would where where 's the where 's where 's to have lied about that its just invisible in the media . We have been talking with former UN ambassador John Bolton is always dynamite stuff . Ambassador thank you so much for coming on the corner report . Always glad you 're here and I hope you that your listeners have a great week thank you have a nice weekend god blessed .

@@27161069 @861069/ <h> Ann Coulter cancels speech at UC Berkeley . <p> 105 . Here on the great WRKO . OK my friends . All lost to talk about in this hour we 'll leave you do n't want to touch that dial . First however . And Colfer . Cancels her speech at Berkeley . There are now serious threats of violence that will take place marchers on the campus . But on the actual in the actual town owners city itself and Brittany I 'm just curious . What is the poll question . And most importantly . What are their results . Thus far . Shining in colts or have canceled her speech . 69% . Know . And 31% . Yes . The interest being . Are you an eight year BCM . I 'll I guess I am totally torn unless . I think if you 're gon na go give a speech . And make sure you bring a security team with you and because this could get ugly . However if she does n't have . You know a security team if other people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not gon na be safe and they can get beaten up or whatever killed me you know in Evan out . Than yet do n't now . If you had to vote right now I 'm saying OK Brittany in your little nimble little fingers there I would say no she should n't of insults . Because I I I feel like you 're the liberals have won on the us . That there is no such thing as free speech anymore they try to shut you down every time you say a word so . I do n't just look at port Jesse Watters now . I now . I mean he made some kind of a crude Yvonne could joke about the way she was holding her microphone . And now apparently what he 's on vacation yeah they yuppies Fox 's senate of vacation so suddenly he 's got all of a sudden he 's just got an immediate vacation . And so it just seems as though everything the people say it 's picked apart and there is . You know no such thing as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ showed . Cancel the speech however if you do n't have this the security for it and if people are gon na get beaten not . Then I think she 's better off and she did n't have the back of Berkeley that 's the other thing everyone backed off . So you touched on it I mean you Yunel that I think look . Here 's what happened okay and I think this is why in some ways . I 'm sort of we 're bringing on this . I 'm genuinely really conflict did I mean usually I might you know I and they are being kind of a guy I 'm either whiter blocker and ash is the way I am . But really on this one I could really see the argument streets for for both sides and I 'll tell you why . Because . It 's clear that what happened was that the people who sponsor and to speak at the bad Berkeley . In particular the young America 's foundation . Made her sponsors . They pulled the plug . Now the reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Years of age . You now have and it looks like it 's gon na blow anyway this is the irony of ironies . She 's canceled her speech she says she may not even appear any she says she may still show up she may not show up we 'll see what happens at a cut next couple of hours . But they . The anarchy is stuck or threatening violence . And many of them were anarchist Communists marxists . A left wing radicals black lives matter . They were coming from all over the country . In fact many of them are continuing to come from all over the country . And so what happened was local law enforcement . Came out and said there is a greater than 99% . Chance . That there will be bloodshed . That there 'll be violence . And that there 'll be a massive rioting and looting . In other words Berkeley is going to burn . And local law enforcement in particular are extremely frustrated with the mayor . Who is not just being more combat Dinara @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the end of the show . He has now been exposed . As actually being a member . Of one of these violent left wing anarchist groups . It 's called by any means necessary band . Which advocates . Physically assaulting people . Who practiced quote unquote flash is speech . What they mean by fascist is anybody they disagree with . So you have a mayor . Who is encouraging . Violent radicals . To descend upon Berkeley . Who has told the cops to back off he 's basically handcuffed to police . The pork concerned citizens are Jeff the live and work week . Are saying they feel utterly helpless and demoralized and frankly frightened . Because it is their shops that are gon na be destroyed . Their banks in windows that will be smashed their cars that are gon na get overturned . At the violence is gon na spill out onto their streets and their homes and their communities . And the cops essentially have been told effectively to stand down . So that the college Republicans . Who invited her . Fearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're going to be bringing clubs baseball bats knives . There were stabbings the last time when Milo spoke a couple months ago they actually burned part of a campus facility . Trump supporters and by conservative students were assaulted and beaten . A couple of them beaten to a pulp so they basically got cold feet . They said look we can sign up for this and soul they disinvited and Coulter . Well at this point if you 've been disinvited you 've lost your sponsor . You do n't have a venue the original rumor auditorium for you to speak out anymore . Because your sponsors have pulled out . So in a way I do n't blame Birmingham again while OK I want you to stand up for freedom of speech you said you 're gon na make a speech he said to graduate come hell or high water . You were not gon na kowtow to them to the rabble to the violent mob . But on the other hand I mean just look at it from her point of view . So I show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their masks on . And they 're fighting with you know whatever with Republicans are with conservatives or . I trumped by occurs speicher 's for trump vowed that they would come down and defender . Veteran said there were gon na come down and defender so you may even have a bloodbath on campus . But there 's no room . There 's no holders not auditorium there 's there 's small venue because your sponsors pulled the plug on . Saw her argument was look I was gon na go oh I look over one shoulder our local over the other shoulder and my allies are gone . So what you know what am I supposed to do . So on the one hand I 'm thinking wow what 's the point gon na showing up . If you wo n't even be able to speak . Because your sponsors stabbed you in the back . The other side in me says exactly would Brittany pointed out . Well then there 's no question about it though . The left has won at least they 've won round @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And maybe needing personally intimidate you but they intimidated to students on campus . And so then the offer to speak was rescinded . And so hence by bullying by threatening by using violence or threatening to use violence guess what . Freedom of speech lost . And soul listen now to and Coulter who was on Sean Hannity last night saying look . The goal of these left wing radicals . Was to squelch . Crush . Conservative speech and freedom of speech . And there 's no question about it . On this spot on this round they want . The university caved . The administrator the administration can lift the college Republicans caved . And ultimately amongst singer really blame her but ultimately . She also caved . Roll it . Jargon I 'm going on with Berkeley when you have and show us how radical universities are generally I mean what you 're talking about I agree with yes they wan na destroy and Kurt and squelch . Conservative speech but there is a separate issue with the university right now when you have . Bernie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and they are n't so once over when there are all saying I 'll get only yourselves Berkeley we have a First Amendment people . How fought and Don I. For the right to free speech on the college Republicans really in this case they are student group on not just you know some homeless person wandering a hole into the square and and I 'm glad but I 'd be allowed to speak and know . She 's she 's completely right . In fact look here 's what I find incredible I really want to think about this could stand back objectively objectively . And in no way I 'm being foolish now . Because I 'm gon na try to appeal to the liberals and to the left and many of them listened to the show they do n't want to admit it . It 's like underground radio for them . But like I know wherever segment in the next hour called corners coax . Whereby a much shorting some of the hate mail but I often yet okay it 's going to be a fun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left wingers . And that the progressives the moon bats listen to the show for whatever for a variety reasons . And maybe I 'm being foolish in my eve to try to appeal to them but just objectively . Okay . Think about this . On college campuses today and then Berkeley . Muslims have . Free speech zones they have a safe space . LG BTQ . Safe space . Anarchist . Marxists . Communists . Feminists . Say space . Everybody . And his uncle . Has a safe speaks . At the university of Berkeley . Except conservatives . How can think about it . They were radical Muslim extremists . A defender of Hezbollah and Hamas . How is he save space at the university of Berkeley . Columbia University . Team violated . Eight Genesee idol mass murderer . Who wants to wipe did who is off the face of the earth are marked off Medina shot . Mahmoud Miami nudge up . Mahmoud Ahmadinejad . No problem . But Ann Coulter . David Horwitz . Charles Murray . Jeff corner . Too much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't what to do . Bring up the mine 's pretty comfortable opponents bring up the clubs . Bring out the blow torch is . Burn it down baby burn deadbeat bound . What this series . Is the resurrection . Of the brown shirts that 's what this is . It is a liberal fascism . At it 's absolute purist form . And what they 're doing is they are deliberately trying to intimidate silence and suppress conservative speech and free speech . Because they fear us . Because they can not rebuffed our arguments see Vick had debate and Coulter . So they have to silence and intimidate and culture . Now . Here is what I think should happen OK two things immediately . Number one that Mair has to go . The governor should be ashamed of himself . If a mob wants to threaten somebody for simply speaking at a university . The National Guard should be called out you need if the local police has their hands tied because it is mayor . Then call called the National Guard . And arrest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mask in public . The mall make you see these anarchist or comment with their with their masks on and everything just arrest them period on the spot arrest them . You 're carrying a club orbit on arrest him . You 're carrying an arrest them because you 're there to do violence bloodshed and mayhem . That 's number one number two I think it 's now time for the president to get involved I really do . I do n't like a federalized matters Imus states ' rights guy I 'm constitutional as conservative to the core . But the First Amendment is the First Amendment is the First Amendment . Berkeley . Is a taxpayer funded university . Tax . Payer dollars goal to fund Berkeley . If you 're going to be taking taxpayer funding . Then to meet . You have a legal obligation nevermind a moral and ethical obligation . You have a legal obligation . To allow any body . Unless they 're calling or inciting violence . That 's something else earlier last cut out . But that 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ na call for Jewish to be annihilated you can say that at Berkeley . You wan na say all conservatives are deplorable and they should be shot and thrown into the gas chambers you can actually say that at Berkeley okay . But unless you 're calling for people and incitement to violence or mass murder . It 's freedom of speech . So pull the president should come in and say we 're gon na be revoking tax Payer dollars to Berkeley . Period full slop . Now if you 're a private university . Then you can set your own policies we want to speak when you do n't wan na speak that 's your business . But if you 're a public taxpayer funded university has Berkeley is I 'm sorry Doug First Amendment applies to you . And it 's about time we hit them where it hurts their wallets . And if the government stepped in and said we are going to be revoke all of your federal funding you 'll see Janet Napolitano mount a current . President the chancellor of Berkeley . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so fast your head is gon na spin . My friends it 's time to take the gloves off . And here Timmy is the ultimate . The ultimate irony of office . She may show up she may not show up Woolsey . It 's the only blown . Local police are saying even if she does n't show while . They 're still threatening violence . To try to Scholl the universe and other universities . If you even in play a conservative speaker . Or controversial conservative speaker a provocative conservative speaker . You 'll see riots you 'll see burning you 'll see looting so you never even think about inviting them again . My friends . If Berkeley blows tonight . Send in the National Guard I 'm not kidding . Take out the batons . Start cracking some heads and put every single one of these punks in jail . And revoke the federal funding and I 'll agree disagree . And Coulter has canceled her speech at Berkeley . Do you think it was a good move . Or do you think it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ president trump is getting ready to make . One point six here on the great WR KOK my friends . Here is a taste of wine and Coulter would likely have said . How her speech today had she been allowed to deliver it at Berkeley OK now I ask you can agree or disagree . What does this warrant . Violence . Rioting . Burning . Looting . Assaulting people clubbing people might think people stopping people . Roll it to . Germ what what I 'm frustrated with right now is I think the GOP should change their motto to next talking . We 'll fight this next time we 'll show them how good we are this time . No we want to win now whether it comes to judges Ruth Gator Ginsburg cancel it . You may go bullish about 98 votes for Republicans and Clarence Thomas 52 gore such bear barely slips the room . You have Donald Trump what 's odd . He gives away doc got many does n't get the wall well that 'll show on how good he ends what a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has for those . Dreamers that illegal aliens he promised to deport next time we 'll get them . And now we have now saying . Well we 're going to strike a blow for for the next speaker at Berkeley . No I want to win now can Republicans ever win . Mean I am with her to be honest with you but still OK even if you disagree if you 're shooting at Berkeley . How does this assault . How does this all . Petrified you would n't frighten you winning danger UN all my coach ca n't bespoke it 's going to be speaking here and all my college at the let 's get a club opened my . So the batons elbow blow torches outlets goal it 's a it 's a start let 's start beating people . Enough is enough . If you do n't like Kirk and if you do n't like what she says just do n't goal it 's that simple . It 's called freedom . Bruce in Connecticut go ahead Bruce . HF . You know I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If you look at if you Google were parade of roses Portland Oregon . They they . Tactic yet so they 're great this weekend because a quote get their actions . As straight and disrupt the parade because it 's it 's one of those I 'd do an RA . Do what . Districting you can do it one of those short term a lot of long term short term as you know Jerry Brown does not gon na call out National Guard . So pardon the trouble that to nationalize a National Guard dictate security situations . Block one long term solution you can do . It 's like to stay in New York Alabama town and other states in the country out . And that is an anti graft law yet and match operates per per bad . It prohibits the where malaria grass . For any public event . It is only three exceptions it 's Halloween mart Mardi Gras in inclement winter what winter weather . In this battle expose people that are going out there covered up their bases if you look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've had . These these these these laws and of fact . You have n't seen these massive riots like in these states that do n't have . Interest thing Bruce very interest in look I mean I wan na look at a more studied a bit morbid .

But you know I 'm think India Marxist these anarchist he 's left wing violent radicals . They 're covering their faces they 're covering their bodies . You only to Wear ski ski mask in the middle of the summer . You only reason why you 're wearing a ski mask in the middle of the summer or let 's say now the spring is because you wan na do violence .

But clearly now what is gon na be very bad for especially if he continues to toughen security on the border . Crack down on Sanctuary Cities . Is it 's going to be very bad for illegal immigrants . And illegal immigrants have been bilking the system . Were years . Not just across the country but especially here in Massachusetts . And one of their biggest targets has been mass health that most of you in fact pay for . And to talk about this is none other than state representative . Jambalaya and Suez @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ representative mark Lombardo . Jim thank you so much for coming on the corner report . It just thank you very much for having me . Me though is the most to be with you think just . Jam . I saw what you guys did I saw the press release I 've been reading some articles and I am stunned so . Almost two million people in the mass in the state of Massachusetts are actually on mass health that the he 's just incredible . All what are 33% of the population . It is a very expensive program . And jam which you 're saying is there is a lot of fraud and abuse . Being committed potentially by many illegal aliens . How bad is the fraud and why does it Democrats continue to try to cover this up . So that they 're at the the first unit which is about two million people is so . Is quite remarkable when you saying that in met when you 're in Massachusetts the term federal poverty . Limit the number of people that are on now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two million people . Who are now so receiving marital benefits . Cooler above the federal poverty line . No one of the interest in numbers that the whole country due respect in 2000 Emeril logo . With the membership make up or not so . Was between Portland 7% of what he called undocumented . On the immigrants . Our legal but not qualified . Immigrants . In that in that uses a quote . 7% of the population . In message of not so . If you do those numbers . Are appalled social . So that 's okay and the Saban the dog is upset lucky when he 's barking in the background . I 'd rather be here at those numbers you look at between 700 . Million and I wo n't point two billion built just can not help going to float to a basically . You would vote public document . 700 million to one point two billion dollars . Right now I think we illegal aliens .

Enrollees increased by 82%. 360000 . New people . Join the ranks from June 2013 . Until January of 2016 . Now at the same time the uninsured rate Massachusetts . Went up .

You can still get no cost insurance . Hero Massa also would have government solicitation . Or people believed their pay to help get clearance . Could join to join Russell .

In 2000 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dollars that you . Today . It is 42% of the state budget . Sixteen billion rubles it has doubled since 2000 and burn . That 's incredible . And of course where the taxpayer and we it 's we taxpayers are footing the tab . We 're paying Carol this . We 'll put that in perspective . The amount of money that we use back the state the state budget . You back to a local cities and pounds to provide education couple safety . Police and fire . In 2000 non . Was 5000000300 . Million adults . So at the same time that not help increase the that 's just told you but eight billion . The amount of money that went from . Our state to a cities and towns increased by 300 million bulbs 100% . Vs 3% . It 's incredible . It 's incredible if you are not jammed a gym we 're up against that in terms of time but so what is your solution so you would mark Lombardo are now sponsoring legislation . How do you want a clean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ care rolls how do we get these illegals off of mass self . Well first well that 's one area that we have that was sending a letter to not help asking them to you looking information . For exactly what this is costing us the more we understand the cost of number two apple limits spending so what we 've proposed that the littlest beneath the same percentage . But it was in 2009 which is 30% that immediately forces but felt . To take care of what not multiple particular . The poor and the disabled . What is going to get the people that they can get crowded out as we continue down this road . The very people that not help ought to be taking care of the poor and the disabled . So two things that we 're asking for right away here from limit spending identify who 's on the planet it in the third in which we believe is an important element . Sold one point two million people who were above the federal poverty tour . We 're asking that helped change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cost burden . Of this subsidized programs and to look and averaging about 2000 balls you . Not all race three and a half billion dollars . Into the system and relieve the pressure . On the taxpayers who call . Solo to basically get in a nutshell we believe that . You do n't you keep continue to spending to continue to make this Tokyo for everybody we have to know who 's on the planet and our . You do n't we 're working no way through it hopefully we just added to the budget both Floridians such an old house . Reject it up all the view it was they 're continuing to try to bring this proposal float through are still below what is . Well Jim I mean I even saw the video they were shouting at you in the state legislature these Democrats . Saying you are heartless . You wan na throw people out on the street . They were calling you every name in the book . It 's incredible whenever you wan na expose fraud and corruption gem all their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to listen very quickly . Where can people go to find out more this is extremely important this affects them their tax money the misuse of their tax money . How did they find out more about this gym work and they go .

This is because there have been so many overdoses and the use of Narcan is up . Do you think this is a good idea ? Kuhner believes this enables drug addicts. - <p> 135 . Here on the great WRKO . OK in my friend 's coming up at 205 . We 're going to be discussing Mother 's Day and in particular . What was the best advice your mother ever gave to you . But first . It 's local . But it 's going national awfully fast . And I I 've got to say this may be one of the most . Radical . And potentially insane ideas I 've ever heard but this is now what they skate is becoming known for listen now to this . This is coming from Cambridge . Cambridge right communism on the charts . So . City officials in Cambridge listen to this . Are now saying . That because of the overwhelming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out I want all of you to just listen to this in Massachusetts . All long . 2000 . People overdosed last year . Who would there were 2000 . Overdoses . In Massachusetts . Alone last year . Deaths forgive me 2000 people died last year overdose . In Cambridge . There are suffering they 've had hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of overdoses. 29 people died but in Massachusetts last year . Over 2000 people died simply from overdosing . Either on old kids or especially on synthetic heroin . This is how bad the situation is getting sold . What what the moon bats at Cambridge are now proposing this is not a joke I swear to you they are seriously considering that 's . Is ten now confront the heroin epidemic and because there are so many addicts . Who are shooting up in public . On the streets in parks . Are overdosing in parks . That they are now proposing listen to this . Accessible . Publicly accessible boxes . The fact contain narc ten . That 's the anti . That 's the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's . So what they 're now saying is that they want to set up these boxes these public boxes that will be containing narc them . They wan na put them on street corners . They wan na put him in parks . They wan na put him in public places . So that if somebody sees it for citi 's civilians walking on the street and you see somebody overdosing on heroin . What you do as you can call 911 . And then 911 would give the access codes to the people that are calling peso in other words I do n't . GIC a guy Jimmy Jimmy 's on the floor his eyes are rolling . He 's overdosed and I call 911 . A go Jimmy 's on the floor he 's overdosing . While OK there 's the box . Here is the exit the access called the access code will open the boxes . And then you pull out an arc and it 's usually now when nasal spray . And they wo n't tell you on the phone how to use the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ save Jamie 's life . And so there are saying that this thing in fact even did a mock trial . Where they had a mannequin on the floor . And they only want to thirty people to participate they did this in Nam I 'm in that in downtown Cambridge . And people not only not only thirty people but in fact over fifty people volunteered . To open up a lock box . And then start administering . The narc . Ca n't do you get your addition you can get thank you and I give it a shot and I do n't be afraid are right they are now the app that 's that 's what they want . There in my you do it on you 'll do it and you 'll do it on you 're doing now . I want you think about the smoke and just to think Collins saying this ideas . Because they can not get the out takes off the streets . Because they can not get the addicts out of the parks the public parks and public areas . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public . In two would ministering nor can because so many of them are old dean and die and now a couple of things your spring to mind right away OK just right off the bat . Yes . Yes only only moon bats could think this is a serious proposal but number one . So they 're I am I see Jimmy . Jimmy had the arm on his side by sea the needle hanging out from his name . And there 's Jamie what is eyes in the back of his head and he 's convulsed sing on the floor . And the cowboys is lazy and drop dead called 911 gim me the access caller okay 4545 . I open it up . There is I 've got the nasal spray . I 'm trying to jam it into Jimmy 's knows but Jimmy 's can ball sing like crazy but I 'm trying to stick it into his nose now . If Jimmy dice . I could be sued . I could legitimately be so . In other words we 'll Jimmy died and maybe you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you get a quicker if you did it 's owner if you did it this way if you you know escorted away into the back of his brain and stand back of his nose . If you get jammed and improperly whatever . Because have you Jamie is now a bit you could easily seen massive lawsuit being opened up or the opposite . I see Jimmy on the floor . Very is Kamal Singh eyeballs and about the present Deri is Jamie 's he 's gon na die any second now and I 'm Derek and I do n't want any part of its . I see the needle hanging dangling from his from his forearm . I 'm Mike if a fight go in there and I stood the mark and and Jimmy guys I do n't wan na get sued president of the pleasure . So I go around Jim . Well then what happens it is . I could be sold why because I did n't call mine 11 I did n't go to accessible public boxed and I did n't administer than our ten . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be put in . So either and in other words somebody who 's now become a heroin addict has become our problem . I go park to shoot up and all of a sudden . It 's my problem to rescue him if he starts all being . Ward because my problem if final rescue him . Because then the obvious what you could 've saved Jimmy . Why did you turn your back on Jimmie was to walk away from Jamie did n't she see Jimmy on the fourth symbols of the moment . Whatever you know what does that whatever saliva dripping out of his mouth you did n't see it up . You could 've saved Jamie you did n't save Jamie . Now what this is also gon na do . Look at the message now that we 're sent . We 've given up . Why are we allowing these addicts . To shoot up in public places . Why all you 're gon na do now is encourage people and say well hey you know one if we keep shooting up . Forget calling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So it 's it 'll encourage Alex to shoot up more perversely . On the streets . In public . Parks . So now because of this . I 've got to worry even more . I take my Ashton Eva let 's say to the park . And now they 're gon na go down a slide . And then he was going to be daddy daddy daddy what what 's wrong sweetheart . Something prick to mean something I 'm bleeding on all its some junkies needle it 's taken . Are sticking out your fight pull that out . Or daddy daddy why is that person shooting himself what is you stick in his needle in his arm for Danny . That he talked to his eyes are all white cocker is always are in the back of his head twice he jerking like is daddy . You know what is that skinny guy that looks like he 's on the verge of dying . What is the ABB A eighty pounder what what what 's he doing daddy . So my kids . Have to potentially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on sidewalks . Into streets . In the parks . And then on Popovic . You 're expecting me . To administer an arcane . To these people this is your solution . What they 're gon na do is this . You 're gon na encourage more overdose is ironically . More drug addicts shooting up in public . And then you 're gon na potentially make the public libel . Whether they do it properly or they avoided . Or they failed to administer the narc and the way they should suddenly then you 're gon na open up a few new molds how many lawsuits . This is one of the most insane ideas I 've ever heard in my life how quote we do something radically different . How about we hammered a suppliers . How about we build a wall . How about we go after the drug dealers how about we clean these drug addicts out of our parks . Out of our streets . Out of our neighborhoods . And give them proper rehabilitation centers how well we have a real war on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want you . And me and Brittany . When you take your kids to the park or here in Britain 's case her niece to the park . Not only should Eusebio addict you have to save the attic . Should we have public boxes with narc and in public places on street corners and in the air and parks to savor resuscitate people . Who over the or overdose who all of the in public . I say it 's insane . What do you say 6170666868 . Your calls next . They got almost put the dragon . I think yeah . Yeah yeah . 149 . Here on the great WRKO . OK Britney and oh your really dying away you know on this . In same proposal but is being seriously considered Cambridge city officials . And they wan na see it is by the way is a model . For cities all across Massachusetts . They now wan na start . Implementing scoring and in public boxes accessible public boxes . On street corners in parks and public areas . So when you see somebody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said 2000 . People in Massachusetts alone last year . Died because of an overdose . That 2000 dead . So this way if you see somebody oh being . You can go call 911 . They 'll give you the access code you pull out the narc and in this case is usually a nasal spray . Stick it up the you do n't see this column Ginny stick it up jimmies and always . And maybe you can save Jim . Now you know it opens up all should you be trying to save Jimmy will you be sold . If you 're trying to save Jimmy and Jimmy dots . Or you do n't wan na save Jamie . Will you be sued . And is this gon na encourage more addicts they 're going public so when you go to a park now you 're gon na see people shooting up right in front of you when your kids . Brittany a go ahead so clearly law enforcement friend upon . Complete this there 's a good samaritan act Jaffa where supposedly he will not get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . However what this I do n't believe it I do n't believe I do n't ever I honestly I just I do n't believe it I think they hear enabling drug addicts and I I do n't think it 's a good idea to put these on the corners I feel like . You know what what is it gon na and every gon na have these on every corner and every city . And he 's someone overdoses . And let me get that point Jeff you know yeah I obviously have a lot of friends that are in my enforcement a really good friend of mine . He was telling me and I column you wan na we want like call him Jimmy does n't need a name the score just harmony and Jimmy sheriff Jim Jim James or not discriminating against people called Jimmy okay Shaq . Our rights so . Jamie has so . He . Late I do n't know if you know how like police schedules . Are its they had some . Do forty 's on TDs off so that he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ someone who overdosed it was a seem kqed . First three days so colossal three days in a row he went to the same house listen to the same kid . I had to administer narc and to say was like yes and then you sense and you know if you do n't street not if you . Do n't help if you continue to do this the next semi get a phone call you might not be here you need to . You know go once he 's someone and be and get clean news you need how . And the kids are not be found on besides he had his duties often exe when he came back to work back that the kid was dad . I I mean police officers EMT hello I 'm Eric . I mean it was a bit different what you told me was when the officer jam came back to work they where he was told the kids and what happened to that kid and they say he 's dead . He was told that the can Vista dead yet he over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overdosed and I think what I thought I was just like what happened you want to see what happened to me is a bailout I got news for he 's dead . So the officer was prophetic . The next time it was too late for the drug addict . Exactly . So you know I 'd I think that the well now now you 're gon na narc him well that 's a thing we are now we 're enabling them they know the sum and coming at top of every time they overdose summons bear it . To be you know scored an argument they 're knows so . Now they 're going to be on the street corners and everything I think and society we need to shame these drug addicts . That it 's not okay to do this and Marin and you know we ca n't have anarchy and it should n't be up to us you know walking around . She 's just need owning means it 's apps cost now you know I 'm not a cop I 'm not fire fire on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is my career . So I do I want my children to see this lumbering into the park LSU my kids have fun act at you know . At the park on down the slot I do n't want someone next to me overdosing and I think in society . That it should be and when you 're growing up you need to learn about drugs and everything we she people that smoke cigarettes . And we praised people that smoke weed I mean and where and needling people that do heroin . We have n't epidemic here something needs to be done and I 'm not too in my own horn here anything that when I was in high school . I did a service learning project was my senior year my final on my final projects . And I had . Inmates from the jail commend you they did drugs and everything I have and command and I had them talk to freshmen . And the high school and tell what they did and how they got clean and why they went to jail I had cops come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did and and learn and the kids learn about drugs and how they 're bad for them not to smoke and everything and in I worked at Derek transferred the gassing ten years . You know so I guess I 've taught all this thing these things to kids . In . They learn the union that I know OK there might be not mean money but why do n't we sign the money we have money . To give illegal immigrants and we have money for people with EBT . And all this fraud and everything that is going on Jeff we money to teach our children . You know not to smoke not to do drugs not to get hooked on heroin not get hooked on opening let 's you know when you get an injury you 're taking these . To help you not to abuse that we need to teach our children that are not doing Matt brown letting them take over our streets and are a lot . It 's this is from 617 Jan this is from Jeff 617 Jeff former law enforcement office . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to bust open the boxes . And steal all the narc them . And Gregg Jarrett that was . We got your point yes it 's exactly there was a story couple months ago about NGH I 'm sure this happens at other hospitals . But you know in the garages the parking garages they have emergency core it 's in case you know you just got out of surgery and hip replacement you fall hours or something happens . And the addicts the heroin addicts are actually going to the garages raping the emergency cords around their arms and shooting up because they know . If they ode and they fall over it 'll trigger the alarm . And the hospital staff will come out and get them it 's like Britney said this is just enabling . A drug culture I do n't understand what we 're getting out that . Incredible I mean just incredible honestly incredible . Mark in Waltham go ahead mark . You have two quick things that I and yes our bits of liberalism that 's fine . In 2016 under and 35 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gone . 2000 ODs we 've got to make your shoot . Brilliant . I mean brilliant obviously brilliant . Gon na set a better myself brilliant might key in marsh field go ahead Mikey . Definitely it 's a compassion on majority Jimmy now a lot more about me . Today you know being like clean needles needle exchange yes now it 's an art and what not that I have liked but phase of picked upon . Life . I wanted to apparent how . I read . You want to hear stuff from Afghanistan . Where you want you want the synthetic stuff for you what appeared very . This stuff is from Bangkok all I 've duck your showed up what does baby you 're in Boca villain bent seconds to get the crystal meth campaign . I. I mean really but I should sister Britney on the way and I said you know look . You know look I 'm not for it please do n't get me wrong but if you could do Denard can think what the hell just given the free give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clean needles and help give them marijuana and I mean at this point really I do n't want solid Hillary Clinton but what difference does it make . I mean if you 're gon na show encourage and enable home at this point what the hell go all the way . You know and remember what they 've told us that if we legalize marijuana . That is still it 's would take care a lot of the drug problems and instead . He just gets senior and Zain year and same year . Scott in Manchester go ahead Scott . Eight up putt that the court point this . You know what . War on drugs and heroin epidemic and then now it more than your estimate of what he 's fed is doing drugs . That are going on I mean as long as we 're sitting them out of the country North Korea 's one of the biggest export on the opium . These drug for keep falling into the country and you know it on site do . We need to stop it or because these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

Keep feeding them you do n't really all soft drinks after softer you know sought after or soda after soda . But make sure the insulin is on tap . You 're not solving anything you 're just enabling them your encouraging them . So it 's the same thing with heroin . All the gon na do now is encouraging Jimmy to shoot up even more and this time to do it in public . And a second placebo box to fund . I 've been really I mean I do n't want Jimmy shooting up but apart in front of my kids do you O. If you 're gon na do it at least do it in your house for God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kids .

You probably had a whole bunch of people who were born in 187 units at all I ca n't believe they 've legalized who 's now I ca n't believe they did doubt why would they overdo it 's it 's just the nature of the beast now . Obviously you you know you 'd hear all these stories well someone started out doing marijuana and they moved on this and that and everything . Those stories and generally when you look at the statistics are the exception to the rule most people who end up using marijuana and do n't go on to become heavy drug use . OK you know this because we 've seen the statistics words like what like 40% of people smoked marijuana at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a 40% of them end up doing something else I wonder how the people .

In Colorado like he still he had it for five years do you still like having recreational marijuana in Colorado . There 's if I 've talked to be by I have some family lives in Colorado they are vehemently opposed they basing its its terrible . But I do n't know that the general pop today providing examples as to why it 's terrible . I get older they 're my age and they think it 's the and they think it leads to a degradation of society is just at the game the lead in the near Tito letters guy here you know . So the the statistics over in Colorado there was a poll that was done by the Denver Post looks like one towards the end of last year in September and that 's after several years of having correct and off 45% . Of people had voted against it back when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 'm only 36 or 8% more in favor of repealing it today so fewer people . Been voted against it back then compared to 45% . It would voted against today and so . It shows that you always are going to have people who think that it should be legal I 'm sure if you polled people on whether or not alcohol sales would be illegal and 20% would say look they should n't sell alcohol because dangers I know the one of the reasons people like it in Colorado is it 's had a pronounced effect on the economy . That commercial real steady jobs unemployment Aaron that side of it 's been very good yeah and when . This is from that same poll when looking at the impact on the economy 61% of his Colorado respondents said the impacted been positive . 19% said negative 14% said no impact at 6% were n't sure . So significant majority there said that they believed it was still good economically to do this .

Hillary Clinton I kid you not . It gives an interview and she talks about why she lost the election who she ultimately blames . And now she says she 's part of their resistance . To drop . Also all . Health care they 're trying to revive the bill in fact there could be a vote sometime this week but it is on the brink . They do not have the votes as things stand right now will there be another train wreck we 've got all of that so much more . Believe me but first the corner country poll question do sure as the French would say of the day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fired from CBS . If you believe the answer is yes tax the letter they eat the six or 8680 . If you believe the answer is no tell lives are gon na stick together on this one Jeff . Text a letter beat the six day 8680 . As always you can vote online at wrko.com . The poll question has always powered by bill Kelly financial services . Brittany what are the poll results . Thus far . 69% . Say no . And 31% . Say yes . I think he should be fired I think he should be five and he wo n't be far I agree with I am I 'm a be on this one I agree that 's what I think as well so . It out just do n't watch bestow I feel like I 'm just do n't watch him . Well maybe we should start an advertiser boycott . I mean that 's how they pushed a rally off the air that 's what they always collapse the conservatives . Maybe we should go after the happy we 'll put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sponsors always advertisers let 's boycott them and hit him where it hurts and rebel force CBS figure out of that club right teach him lesson . And just my opinion 6172666868 . Okay my friends . The administration . The trump Brigitte the trump administration the president the president 's men and women especially as communications staff . Are desperately trying to push pin . The budget measure . I have a column up on wrko.com . Slash cornered . I urge everybody please read it possible long where I talk about what 's actually in the budget . And how trump was clearly outmaneuvered by Ryan and outmaneuvered . By the Democrats . And really now what we hop . Is Ryan is de facto president of the United States . That 's I hate to say it . But when it comes to the budget key spending issues Ryan is now essentially president . And trump my guess is his house speaker . He 's basically following Ryan bleed . And so as I lay out in my column exactly what happened to the president how he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he needs to do I I lay out a strategy for him what he needs to do to finally get a read and replace Ryan . And who that person is and why . So it 's a strategy now to correct the course right now of this presidency . Because if things continue they way they are with him embracing Ryan . It will spell I believe president Trump 's political do . And so are merging all of you please read the column it 's up on wrko.com . Slash corner . Trump loses big on the budget . Mean hashed out corner KUHNER . And read it pass it along to all of your friends now there has been tremendous blow back . It 's not just for me it 's coming now for many of trump staunchest supporters and allies . It 's Laura Ingram it 's Michael Savage . It 's on a bright park in particular has been very aggressively pushing back . And so now the administration is feeling . Is the anger . This sense of betrayal . From much of Trump @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operation . And I think they 're making it worse I honestly I really do I think now they 're just digging themselves a deeper hole . So now listen Davis as you know I pointed out in my column . The budget itself this Republican Democrat it 's really a Ryan Schumer budget this Ryan Schumer budget . Does . Allocate one point five billion . Well what Sean Spicer first strike did do and it 's been followed up by other . Trump administration officials . Is now try to claim . That well lol . Dear reason money going towards a wall really . Because if you read the budget the eighty expressly forbids . Ryan made shorter of this . Deck not east sent not a shackle . Not 88 Saul . Gorge goes towards construction or building a whole wall . So what they 're trying to spin now is another words the one point five billion will go for . Drones . For sensors . For more technology and two armed . To a bowl stir reinforce some of the steel fences . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a special longer Rio Grande river because the Rio Grande the big river . It covers much of the US Mexico border and obviously this is not part of border security it 's flood management . On the Rio Grande floods that 's why you need though the Levy protection system . So but so what they 're claiming listen to this now here 's the spent . That will mole we did n't get funding for a wall . Where . Well because the money is being huge to reinforce our shorty who steel fences . And also to help reinforce some of these levees . Are you all look like along the Rio Grande do this flood protection system . And so what does steel fences are are really very see through Wall Street . It 's a wall but you can see through it . It 's not a concrete wall it 's gone up about earlier it 's not a brick and mortar wall . It 's a kind of like a fence but we 're reinforcing it with so much for seeing this kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ claiming I swear to you god as my witness . That this steel . Wall this 'll colts this fence . Is actually better . Than a mugger thick concrete wall . Because you conceived rule . Defense . So when the illegals are throwing stuff at the Border Patrol like when he toss it over wall . You can actually see what they 're throwing . You ca n't if it 's just the massive block of concrete . So Sean Spicer . Went up and started showing pictures I swear he Bob Levy 's . And our offense since . And saying you see . That 's what 's gon na be bolstered in this era in Indy one point five billion dollar appropriation we have in the budget . He is starting to build a wall you see defense that 's all . Do n't levees that 's all let 's just go look you 're looking at a wal now . Sean Spicer tried it . He sent his deputy to try to convince people like bright Bart and others I mean getting emails from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I missed characterizing . It that there are actually funding the wall . It 's just stuff I see through wall and the Levy walls and doors and walls that really matter . Well then they sent out may mole may mean the Office of Management and Budget director . Listen now to Mecca mall grainy piece with pictures behind him it 's really of a big steel fence and have a mother Levy . So he 's got the Levy and he 's got the steel fence . And he 's basically trying to save animal . You 're gon na believe meat or your ice because I 'm telling you about soul and all of them I mean to be fair the media is like . That 's not well . I mean immediately put a its offense and that 's a Levy was not a wall . Well Mick mold Rainey is trying to convince bamboo more importantly trumps of voters and supporters . Because now Schumer is spiking the football . Now Nancy Pelosi spiking the football . And we do n't to be fair biggest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And their bases and we got everything that we wanted as a point out on the column the Democrats got everything trump got nothing . And Ryan ensured . That he balked all off trumps major priorities . So Ryan won and the Democrats won you know who lost we did his voters . So now there in a BHP . In operation . Listen now to make molding standing there at the podium . Pointing an accusing pictures of a steel fence and out Levy flood protection system saying the money 's gon na go to that . That 's a wall that 's the beginning of the wall we won we 're winning you just do n't know it but we 're winning . Roll it 's jar . This . Stop drugs and does n't stop criminals from crossing the border back does not hardly anything . This does and that 's what we got in this deal and that 's what we 're so excited about the opportunities not Gartner . He 's pointing to an actual concrete rule . And he says all that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That does n't stop drugs and that does n't stop illegals so he 's pointing a defense steel fence . Please point me to know at all . Dot dot dots you see . Concrete does n't . But this steel fence . I mean it 's impregnable it 's it 's just like the Great Wall of China it 's it 's it 's you can you can bust through it continue jar . Slater about the opportunities that we have to follow through on the president 's promises to secure the southern border so unless we the other the other picture of that question . He runs for him . Were the guys that Warren . General the general that this is all by the way they teachers said they want to set the Oval Office the president we talked about rich morrow talked about concrete walls . This is what it 's yes walked why because it actually works better at twelve under anything at your question that . You can see from this one it 's actually think . This . Bust the field fence for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just about the details but there 's been a dramatic reduction in attacks on our Border Patrol agents . We 're vacancy but all those rolling . Well . This is what he wanted . It 's also half of the cost . Twice as much it 's his money and reports . That 's a huge land . It 's a huge win . So basically that the port is at 10 DH just the Department of Homeland Security not do n't want the concrete wall all they want offense . They want that 's what it is and what they keep calling metal wall but anyway . They want this bill France . Because you know you can dig under the ball well you can dig under offense . In fact I do n't wan na get too technical here . The reason why you needed a wall the reason why trump promised a wall like but . 500 types and he was dead ruin he was doing . You cut through offense . What the drug cartels the MS thirteen gang bangers that human traffickers the drug @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They 're just cutting through the fence . Now I know a few reinforcing with more steel wiring it 's gon na be harder to cut through Y get it but you 're still cutting through . That 's why you need the mother concrete . So you know they are both in what they can when you when they throw stuff but the Border Patrol you can see it because there 's they do n't defense is click on the call your seat for wall but it 's offense so you can see through a defense . Let him try to throw something over 304050 . Foot wall . What I mean what are you people do you think we 're that stupid . But hold on . Soul trumpet now realizing he got burned by Ryan . And it 's clear now that the Democrats have gotten under his skin . You can see Schumer and Pelosi there are gloating you 're crawling and the facts are undeniable . He got played . He outsourced it to Ryan that 's what he did he outsourced to Bryant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now we got burned . So he 's very upset . That the Democrats now are crowing . So trump is now saying when the spending bill expires at the end of September . They 're gon na start again for fiscal year 2018 . And trump vows if the Democrats this time true threatened to filibuster . And if there 's no funding for a an actual wo n't . I do n't know wrong so I guess the only offense then now they want to wall but anyway . Yeah and you 'll see a government shut down . So now they 're saying we did n't fight Janice Stein but next time you 're gon na get a government shut down . I know Laura against the Jerry do me a favor just play Mick molding so here 's Mick moving any malice minister saying okay okay okay . Oregon and in September . Roll it Jared . The president you know we 've got this morning looking ahead to fiscal year eighteen . Shut down maybe just things you can clean up this budget mess do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You know I 've I 've I 've I 've been through a couple of shut downs . It 's . Let me answer that question this way . That 's a good discussion have a September I think the president is frustrated . With the fact that he negotiated in good faith of the Democrats they were not trying to spike the football and make you look back . And I get that frustration and I think it 's terrible posture for the Democrats today if we should your try to prove to people that Washington is going to be different . If we 're gon na change things we get actually forgot what you work for them . And they do that this president that I listen I would have taken offense that so I just surprised you know all his frustrations manifested that way we 've got a lot to do that out we ought to do which we announced that amber . I do n't anticipate shut down in September . But if you situations that the Democrats are gon na behave any better than they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll . Womb . Who . I mean honestly if you 're Chuck Schumer if you 're Nancy Pelosi . Do it . Ooh you 're gon na all not you gon na threaten notch you 're not a political man oh man Oleg Denver shut down . My friends this is pathetic . Spin . Who is this guy . This is the guy that 's you you 're you 're you 're quarterback on this he 's your point man . Dealing with the media on this absolute fiasco . Look let me tell you what trump just realized okay . He 's hearing it now from the base from people like me and people like you and were giving him and his team hell that 's what 's going on here . And now they 're desperately trying to spin . A defeat into victory . They honestly think Chuck Schumer is gon na change . You did n't expect them to crawl or do you think they 're gon na change their ways . Did Democrats . Are out to destroy you . And Ryan is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your thick head . 61720666868 . Now the administration is saying they 're actually funding a wall . Is a steel fence and I led the all all . We 'll build the wall plugs do n't even learn about go to sleep gone go to sleep restless if there . That 's the final . Thing we needed . 126 . Year on the great WRK all Maryann in New Hampshire thanks for holding on welcome . Marianne hello hi go ahead you 're on the air Marion . And get on the plane and non optional when he needs me I 'm Chuck Schumer clip her me to believe . How . Yeah kind of you think he mentioned . One of them is . An optional . Well . It is totally . In line . Well on the yeah me and has been banned and opted on the talk shows . They do n't hear are on the conservative . Did that I am and I come back to your parent lectern then I think collier . Term . Let out her own people wrong with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot sleeping gas . On with few Marianne look at Ted cruises piece of legislation I Bakken 1000% . But even that 's very revealing . Because it 's no wonder reply all or most other Republicans do n't wan na sign onto it . So here you have it 's a silver bullet . Here you have a proposal that would seize fourteen billion dollars all of all chapels assets . Criminal illicit assets to use the money to pay for most of the wall . So there 's not one cent a will come from US taxpayers . Are Mexico essentially the Mexican drug and drug kingpin so essentially Mexico pays for the wall . And there you go the issue was settled . There 's no threat of a government shut founders . It 's not a problem . They do n't want the wall . McConnell does n't want the wall McCain does n't want the wall I Susan Collins does n't want the wall Paul Ryan does n't want the wall . That 's why there 's gon na be no Walt . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say well offense is a wall Olivia is a wall . All the Democrats that next time if they do n't behave better next time we 're gon na shut the government down I 'm like are you guys on crack . Good is it Democrats are not gon na change and Ryan is not gon na change .

Drawn gaps or holes . My friends the mother of all capitulation . Means there 's no other way to put it . OK let 's get right into it my friends . They Democrats led by Nancy either for Iran up below sea Chuckie Schumer Senate Minority Leader . Are now literally . Crawling . They are bragging and boasting pitch every media outlet in the country . That they have now won a decisive victory in the budget battle with the Republicans . And especially with the president Donald Trump . As Chuck Schumer told the Washington Post in this morning 's edition . We had our strategy . We had our principles . We stuck to Guam and we won and we won big . There 's no getting around it my friends . The budget agreement that now has been agreed to by both Republicans led by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Is a victory . For the establishment . It is a victory for Ryan . It is a victory for the Democrats . And no matter how the president or his men try to spin it . It is a significant . Defeat for the president for his agenda . And for conservatives . My friends . They got rolled . They got completely outmaneuvered and played . By Ryan and Chuck Schumer and Pelosi . It is a one point one trillion dollar deal . Doug will avert the so called signal that the the boogie man of a government shut down . It will keep the government now completely funded until the end of September . Which will then set up the budget apparently for the 2018 . Fiscal year . So it finds the government for essentially all the way into September 5 full months . What is in the deal . It is day one point one trillion dollar omnibus spending bill they that 's the first problem . The constitution . And the way we used to run things in this country . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human services . For the Defense Department . For agriculture . For in other words separate spending bills dealing with separate areas of the budget and the government . Would they have now done and this is how you get a lot of beef pork barrel spending . This is where the lobbyists come in and you get big huge giveaway it 's and the massive waste and fraud and corruption . Is you put it altogether they call him on the bus eight big package a total package . And you throw everything in there . And it 's all lobbyists dream . It 's so hot tub it 's a swamp they love that they love it . And so what is in this budget . There is no funding for the border wall in fact Ryan 's sole outmaneuver trump listen to this . Not only is there are no funding for the wall . Ryan made sure that the one point five billion that is allocated for border security . Which right away will primarily go to . Renovate defense I 'm not kidding . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of partially put up in parts of California and Texas . They 're gon na basically . There 's defenses kind of it 's getting a little luck its sagging . So they do n't want the fans the sag so they 're gon na kind of art you know basically go home improvement on defense . And they 're gon na put in some a few more drones and a few more sensors . That sit . He specifically . Made shore it 's in the bill itself . That not one penny . Not one pace soul not one shackle mach one horrible . Could ever gold towards the beginning of the construction of the border wall so not only is there no money for the border wall . Ryan made sure that it could not ever possibly be used to build a border wall . Specifically . Denying any money allowed to go to the construction of a wall . So they do n't fumble . There are no cuts in spending or federal funding for Sanctuary Cities . They outplayed sessions and trump on that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fact that trump wan na numb for the EPA . In fact the EPA is funded to 99% . Of what it used to be under Obama . So trump called for massive cuts to their funding the EPA . Trump called for huge cuts to the National Institutes of Health causes a lot of waste and fraud and misuse of money . Not only are they fully funding the National Institutes of Health listen to this . They got even tool billion more then they had under Obama . The Democrats in total can not believe that they actually got . Five billion dollars more in extra spending . For more government program it 's cuts in foreign aid none . Trump wan na numb did n't get them . The massive deportation force . Remember there he called for a deportation forced . To start deporting millions of illegal immigrants . No fun being non matter for deportation force . The only thing trump god and really it 's not much of a concession because that 's what Ryan wanted anyway . Was fifteen billion dollars to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's it I mean that 's it . If it was a resounding . Defeat . On every front . The wall most spending . There 's no border wall mall funding and no . No funding for the deportation force . No cuts the foreign aid no cuts the bloated government programs no cuts to welfare . In fact Planned Parenthood continues to be funded . Despite the president 's explicit promises despite the vows of countless Republicans . That if they just controlled the White House and congress . That taxpayers would no longer be paying for the murder of unborn babies . No Planned Parenthood gets the same amount of money it always got . I do n't know what to tell you . I mean I really do n't . This is not the art of the deal . This is the art of how to lose it deal . I think honestly somebody needs to remind the president you know maybe you should fight for a budget the way you fight for a casino . Maybe you need to fight for the budget the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Because . Outside of the military . He got a whole list . I mean he got a hole is too big time . And so despite . Admitting the inevitable . Trump delivered an interview to a Bloomberg . Saying that he is extremely happy with the budget . That in fact it 's a good thing that Democrats are crowing . Because that means there 's something for everybody the Democrats are happy Paul Ryan is happy . And I trump is happy . He says he accomplished his goal listen to this of of burning it government shut down . Daddy government shut down he says in the early months of his presidency . Would be politically disastrous . So in other words Ryan played on like a fiddle . Ryan essentially scared him and frightened him . Do n't have a government shut down you 've got to give the Democrats what it .

Who just learned the art of lying in dissembling and manipulating and so there 's more times . So basically the president wants sit down the president 's calling for it wo n't tell me how you gon na pay for . By the way Ted Cruz has given them away through the Al chapel lacked . Nobody wants and congress to support it . Because the donor and the donor class and the global list the establishment . Dean do n't want that wall built . And so Ryan is fighting tool and mill to make sure that wall never gets built @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so obvious to me . In collusion with Pelosi in collusion what Chuck Schumer and collusion what John McCain in collusion with Mitch McConnell . And so what we now have with this budget and I 'm not gon na sugar coat it should not draining the swamp . This is filling the swamp . Schwartz getting bigger . And if trump is not careful . His America first agenda . Is going to be completely submerged . And buried under this swamp . And so my question now to you is this . It is the corner country poll question of the day . Is this budget a defeat for trump . If you believe the answer is yes tax the letter eight to 68680 . If you believe the answer is no Jeff you 've got to play the cards you 've been dealt peeved was dealt a bad hand . We he 'll win it then next time Nextel letter beat the 68680 . Or you can vote online at wrko.com . The poll question is sponsored by bill Kelly financial services . Poll results . Your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no I want to win now . Trump got rolled . The Republicans generals . Taylor but nothing really it 's sort of embarrassing . I understand the strategic idea . We 're halfway through the only a few months left you save your fire for September when you do next year . That 's what they say every time they say they 're fire and they do n't use it the next time . Now . Trump has been wonderful I think in truth throwing a lot of ideas starting with the gas tax . They came idealism a great idea but there 's no denying the fact that this was not a win . He was not the winners he said he was n't negotiator . This is a total loss . 1227 . Here on the great WRKO . As one of the taxpayers put it . 781 . I thought no sorry 617 Jeff . Trump did n't get rolled . Trump cell borders got rolled . The six sold three Jeff trump has been swallowed by this swamped his America first agenda is dead . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think it 's a setback I think it 's a defeat . Woolsey . Woolsey . He 's got one more year before the mid terms . I will just say this if there is no wall or at least serious construction of the wall before the mid term elections . He 's in big trouble . He is in big trouble and the problem now it 's that this budget bill . Sets the stage and all of the priorities . For next year 's budget . Because you 've already given up such significant ground . It 's gon na be very difficult now . Tour rolled Democrats and force establishment Republicans . When you 've already conceded so much in the first round of negotiations . So if I 'm Donald Trump I would be very worried at this point yes you averted a government shut down . But now you 've put your very agenda at risk agree disagree . Merrick in all Europe 's first go ahead nick . They were thought good afternoon everybody . I 'm I just wan na say that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And then start eliminating them one I want and do n't be you know taking a mosque yeah electoral votes goblet not . You know what I do n't think they should just battled did as one million dollars you can bet coming out of my pocket . Nick which are saying is we should start voting the bombs out correct . I 'm with few . And the first one that 's got to go the first one that 's got the goal is Paul Ryan all Ryan and notice . It 's heat took care of his donors all you got to give him his due . No money for the wall Sanctuary Cities fully funded . No money for deportation force he even made sure . That there was a money for more visas for more Muslim refugees . I mean say what you want about this guy . But this guy when when his donors say jump . He jumps . 61720666868 . Is the number . Who won who lost . And are you disappointed . In the president your calls next . Trump @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really sort of embarrassing . 1236 . Here on the great WRKO . That of course is . Fox News analyst Charles Krauthammer . I think stating the obvious . They big defeat for the Republicans . I think even a bigger defeat for trump . Now I wan na just play a little bit of the president in Harrisburg Pennsylvania . I played Sean Spicer . Trying to spin this as a victory for the president it is and it is and but listen to trump . Telling his supporters . Who were you want an America first agenda beginning with the construction of the wall . Telling them it 's a done deal . The wall is gon na get built gold to sleep on it it 's it 's it 's going to have built it but it 's its ticket to the bank just go to sleep . Roll it Jarrett and we need the walls and we will build the wall I humor as you are standing there his nine . I. We 'll build the wall plugs do n't even worry about it go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That 's the final . They windy . Okay I mean I do n't doubt his sincerity I really do n't I think he intends to build a wall he wants to build a wall we understand the necessity of a wall . For illegal immigration for human trafficking for drugs for crime for MS thirteen for so many reasons okay . For restoring our borders and our sovereignty . What I do n't think he gets serious . He 's in the swamp . And he 's charming up with one of the biggest snakes mainly Paul Ryan Orion . And so far right Orion is thought getting wins for himself . For the right notes . For the chamber of commerce for the establishment . But trump is pretty much gotten nothing . Listen now . Because I think she 's dead on . Listened to Laura Ingraham Fox News Channel shares are all syndicated radio show . Coming coach he 's waving the front page I read that story as well the front page of the Washington Post . And she makes the obvious point where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bowl walk the president 's agenda completely . We have one on our priorities . And she makes the obvious point . There is funding for Planned Parenthood . Various funding for . A Muslim refuge she resettle sense and refugee protections and visa it 's . There 's a funding for eight Avant I Hage who all of visa program with some that is . That will bring in low skilled workers foreign low skilled workers into the United States . So stealing even more jobs . And undercutting the wages of working class Americans who help electron . Joseph . And they get all of this . And we do n't even get a lousy penny . I a red cent for the wall . For the Republicans . There will be hell . To pay . Roll it . Jar I find it to be so . At it could it be demoralizing . A disappointing . And I think they 're gon na have hell to pay for this but you 're not gon na get . I handle on spending and the fall contrary to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ members of the freedom pocket last night . 2018 is mid term elections they 're gon na be brave right before the mid term election . Let 's let 's that they always do . Then all of their work and build our wall ought to are there are gon na drain the swamp that word our crack down on sanctuary said he did n't . Yeah got to give us more house members got it does even now larger majority in the senate there . And we can really do it . The base is not gon na come out to vote in the mid term elections . If they keep giving us garbage . Budgets like this . That essentially shaft and betray trumps very voters and he 's very agenda . And so the question then is and wants are taking your calls one final point . Where do we go from here . The question is where do we go from here . Because it 's clear that we need a new house speaker . Oh Ryan do n't Ryan . Is a snake . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clearly has his own agenda . And even Chuck Schumer let we let the cat out of the bag . He can see Chuck Schumer now ca n't stop bragging and we ca n't stop bragging he in his mouth is just saying stuff that he should n't be saying . He openly admitted to McClatchy listen to this . That he and Ryan even said this . The Republican and democratic establishment in congress we have much more in common . Then either a much do with the president . And so if the president will just get out of the way these are sure resorts . And not metal in the budget negotiations . He goes we can just keep doing this forever . Because on all the big issues . Open borders . And this the free trail you can run not just one do n't bowl line . Orion Orion is in bed or a sabbatical . With Chuck Schumer which Hillary Clinton . And with the establishment Democrats . So the question is . Who would we need to replace him . Let me tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment and this should be the budget that she should make his stand you wan na I healed the fight on . This is now why believe they built a fight on . Congressman Jim Jordan . One of the top leaders of the house freedom caucus our principal populist conservative . Who always says is honor our promises to our voters that 's it that 's his guiding principle you make promises your fight form and you honor him . Listen now to Republican Ohio congressman this is the guy . That I think now we should support and topple Paul Ryan and have him be the next house speaker . Listen to him saying I 'm not supporting his budget . And I can tell you many in my fellow conservatives . No way he rolled it . Jarrett now I mean look money goes to plan parent as you said many continues to get a Sanctuary Cities but no money for the border wall . I 'd I think against a lot of conservatives being against this this plan this week . I do n't know why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ short term spending bill if we were gon na actually fight for the things we told voters we 're gon na fight for . So we have been I mean if this is the deal we 're gon na get it seems to me we should just did the bill for the whole year but we specifically held a vote for . We did a short term spending bill for this time so that when Republicans controlled government . We can actually do the things we campaign on this bill does n't seem to do that . Plus it maintains Chris decided that for every new dollar you spend in defense money . You got ta give the Democrats more money in on defense that 's again not what we campaigned on so . I 'm disappointed bulls will see how plays out this week and I think you can see conservatives have some real concerned this legislation . Bingo . In fact he 's very honest that 's why things I really admire about him please a straight shooter from the heartland they might be a lot of people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . course work and our university . Salt of the earth honest good decent people ca n't they just they 're you know what you see is what you get . They say what they mean and they mean what they say that 's it very simple and and and and to the point . They play in recent years the Republicans played us . They find what they call a C are continuing resolution . Saying oh yeah yeah yeah we 're gon na fight for your gon na fight for you but Obama ca n't be in the White House we got to wait till we get trump in the White House you see that we have a president Republican president a Republican House are Republican senate . Wink wink wink winked . So I kicked the goddess Diana live that 's one Weinstein . But you 're gon na finally get what you want . This point is if you 're gon na cave and capitulate does is essentially Obama 's budget . It should 've done it last year . Why mislead . The voters . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell their voters one thing election time and then when they go to the swamp . When they go to bed culture of corruption . Case when they go to bad . They go to that massive hot tub . And they sell us down the river . Jim Jordan for house speaker . You wan na know a guy that should be running the Republicans in the house a guy that actually fulfill Trump 's agenda and priorities . Who 's a fighter . Stuff who 's got a heart who 's got character who 's intelligent . Who actually stands and supports the base instead of constantly shop net . This is the guy . Bruce in Connecticut go ahead Bruce . My friend at work long and hard to help control book . Elected . In a very difficult state . Try shortage true colors . Well the 3 o'clock this came out that they are not the most support . Why Ryan care . Any came out really showed his true colors when he attacked them . What he did when he checked freedom caucus . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evangelical voters he he attacked . 3 o'clock in cheek and and and almost conservative . Republicans . Brewster completely I mean look that 's look I think this is Trump 's biggest strategic mistake . And I said this in several columns I can only say it again . He 's allying himself . With the establishment . With the people who utterly lo wood and hate him . Ryan is not his ally . Ryan is his enemy . And eventually eat trump is gon na realize this he will believe he 's gon na compensate all Michael he 's been playing for full . Because I know would Ryan told them Ryan told him give me it 's just no government shut down . Give me this . And then next budget and give your walls . And he 's an all white only gamba . In six months we 'll concoct some think because what Ryan is is a professional liar just look at him . That guy or least the guy analyze for a living room . And he 's good at it he 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Choo put those big blonde ex . And seems so how we do we pennies from Wisconsin and Iowa from Wisconsin Wisconsin it 's such a and earnest honest simple state peace scandinavians . Up there have been all about moan for lining . And he just looks you right in your Ryan . And I abatements worth punish children on my children . Donald . I need this but I 'll be here for you in September . And then trample get shafted . Again . Them in behavioral go ahead Adam . There are certain McCall Butler Islamic army basically hit everything right on the and that . When it comes down to it and I this what hope people will see great now more important there is right now no difference between Democrats and Republicans . Especially on the majority side yes there is a minority of people . Like you know Thomas Massie and then German that you just Jim Jordan Jim Jim Jordan . There are small percentage and and in this is about that we 're going to be fighting could go all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 80% . Of these establishment . Ryan knows that in no better and the Democrats that we all and up artwork and over . So what are we gon na do about . I mean I 'm personally I was what were transported to its to drop off with but . I got on the train your because I looked iris or you know what . If you do a search people this is what happens we get the lesser weevils . At a very well said thank you for that call look what we need to do is I think what Laurie Ingram and what do myself and other conservatives are gon na do . We have to let the Republicans and the president know look we want you to enact which are saying in Harrisburg . We love your speech is we do . And we do n't even doubt your sincerity because I think you honestly believe them but you 're in bed with their . Bags . And you do n't get enough mold this is not good enough we want to win now . John @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mitt . Yes okay John in Brockton go ahead John . Yeah that would be on glad you . Looking at . Yeah I mean riveted debt omnibus spending bill gave the president Obama 's desk and everything true yes . So then . He 's again host leadership . Underlying here . That we need you working against jittery he could n't put together to get the vote come they 'd be . I will be the whole . This visit is part of the about the plant where the field . But again we get dragged on in here we are again we get this seven budget we get nothing on the surface . So . Q we have blank tape that been negotiated something greater behind the scene of these trade that 's the only thing that I can . All you touched on it but John that 's you look you hit that you hit the nail gun is the best audience in the business . This is the 64000 dollar question what trump is essentially saying behind the scenes wink wink . For Ryan and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want a government shut down . I 'm not gon na give the Democrats a government shut down because he thinks he 'll be a political PR nightmare . But Ryan has agreed . That we 're gon na get the wall . We 're gon na get the funding of planned now . Aaron good we 're gon na get the funding of Sanctuary Cities we 're gon na get money for the deportation forced . We 're gon na get all of dot in 2018 . Okay . Woolsey . My prediction I could be wrong on muscling I have you know a special crystal ball or something . My prediction which got snake and that flyer . You 're gon na get nothing again . And then trump is gon na realize I 'm telling you these guys are bigger shy stirs and comment . Then the casino owners in New Jersey . He was you know I thought the the casino business and and and the mobsters in we in New Jersey or a bunch of lying thieves well all . Are nothing compared to Washington @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more time . And dot will then be the end of Brian 1256 . Here on the great WRKO . Okay Jerry and Cape Cod you 're up next go ahead Jerry . Definitely Jeff . Thank stick Michael a little risk free bit in Mike Pence of convince trump that Ryan is the answer . It although this is BJ app you do not on your poll question .

@@27161143 @861143/ <p> Tonight I order a targeted military strike on the air feel . In Syria from where it chemical attack . Was warm . It is in this vital . National security . Of the United States to prevent and deter their spread and use of deadly chemical . Weapons . 106 here on the great WRKO . OK last night . The president trump board heard a massive tomahawk missile strike . 59 tomahawk missiles were launched from the USS Porter and the USS Ross . Aimed at a Syrian air base the air base was . Practically destroyed badly damaged . The numerous Syrian planes were taken out . It was a blow to Syria 's air force . And I saw its ability to wage an air campaign . And so the question now is do you support president trumps air strike . Joining us now is former UN ambassador John Bolton ambassador Bolton I just wan na be straight up with you . I completely . Disagreed with Trump 's actions last night I know you favorite . Tell me why I 'm wrong . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Look I think that . That the strike was the correct decision and I thought it was . A strong and decisive move it was very . Limited targeted precise . And it was in response to something . That is very much in the national security interest to the United States you know as Syria . Is a party to the chemical weapons convention as is the United States that convention . Prohibits the use of chemical weapons . And I think whatever our country . That 's part of an anti proliferation . Agreement . Uses a weapon of mass destruction chemical biological or nuclear . That it does adversely affect the United States I do n't think this strike . Commits the United States one where the other in the conflict the inside Syria I think the ball is now on this . Courted Syria and and Russia . And I do think we need to be thinking leaving aside for second about what happens in the Middle East once we defeat I basis . Because I do n't want to see . Us gaining a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Iran and its surrogate in the region . Including the aside government . Emerging stronger position to threaten our friend the George in the Arab monarchies and Israel . So this is I do n't I do n't I know in the debate I 've heard during the course of last night this morning . A lot of people have tried to . Read into this pro or con . The idea that this now can attest to the civil war in Syria and I really do n't think that 's right . I think that . The the the doors open for more steps to a question about that . But I think that 'll depend on what Syria and and Russia dues so . I I think the I I can I should I support what happened and I 'd be interest to your response . Ambassador if you remember the 2013 . Chemical weapon attack . And Obama drawing the Red Line and everybody jumped to the conclusion that a sought was behind it . When the UN did their investigation Carla del Pont de herself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the Muslim rebels . Who had used chemical weapons . The false flag to draw the United States through the western . Our community in to intervention potentially against the song . What overwhelming conclusive evidence do we have . That I saw it actually did launch that chemical weapons attack why the rush . Why not wait a couple days let the UN investigate let the Russians make their case . Well let us make our case . Why they were rushed to control the current or the rush to judgment and the rush to conclusions when we going to when he thirteen . That it may have been very likely a false flag operation . Well remember in 2013 and then in subsequent . Cases . That the DC use of the chemical weapons . This really could be ascribed to the rebels only in some of the uses and look I do n't I do n't think some of the rebels who were . L news strike al-Qaeda . Muslim extremists one of the reasons why I have n't favored . The US aiding as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ today I do n't think there 's any question that the government to Syria had extensive chemical weapons that it was prepared to use . As . As the father of the current . Aside dictator . Head to head had taken steps against his own people before . So in my view . See the propensity of the regime 's use a chemical weapons was was clearly established and you know that 's why . The Russians . When they heard the Red Line argument we 're prepared to negotiate to eliminate the it 's as stockpiles of Syrian chemical weapons that they had that this period has long denied they ever had . And I think what we saw was exactly what you would expect . From a and arms control agreement with Syria and Russia is they complied with that in part . But they did n't comply with that in part and that their purpose of evasion was clear right from the beginning . So that even after John Kerry and Barack Obama declared victory and that you still saw uses of chemical weapons . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indicates that the strike on Tuesday . The argument from the regime and Russia was that the that they 've been the Syrian planes had hit a rebel stockpile . That the evidence just was n't there to support that . And if they had had evidence I think the other Russians in the Syrians would have produced at so I think it was right not to let a lot of time go by I think the at Providence so the response the strike . Demonstrated seriousness . And and I think the outraged reaction from . From Russia and North Korea and Iran and and and all the usual suspects . Shows that this was . That they 're correct response that by the truck administration . Ambassador . If you actually look at it from a science point of view for a second . He has a president now in the White House who before the chemical weapons attack essentially is policy was . Hands off Syria who govern Syria is up to the Syrians . So we had somebody that was n't looking for regime change he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now has American special forces on the ground looking for a final push to defeat crisis in Rocca . He has the full support of Russia he 's now holding a winning hand the war seems to be going his way . He 's got all the momentum . Why would you then launch it chemical weapons attack . All but could do is alienate the western world may be bring in the Americans for intervention . Maybe even drive a wedge between himself and his biggest partner Russia . If you look at it from a science point of view he has zero interest zero . In launching a chemical weapons attack so why would he do it . Well I think I think he has a lot more than zero interest I think this is an opportunity for him to find out . Whether it the trumped administration . Is says . Two lists as its predecessors it was a kind of experiment . And in that sense he may well have thought that much like Barack Obama . Trump was all talk and no action . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure and I do n't I do n't like to point the finger . Necessarily but that we did have statements by senior trapped administration officials in the past week or ten days . Essentially saying that they had no trouble with . Aside remaining in power so he may have thought he was enabled it 's somewhat more dramatic contrast but remember . Dean Acheson famous speech in 1950 where he draws the US defense parameter in the western Pacific . And leaders have South Korea . And with that a few months North Korea 's invaded South Korea this this is what happens when you make statements and do n't think through the implications . So as they say I I ca n't prove it that the sides thought he had been given a green light by the administration . But I thought those comments were ill advised when they were made . And even more ill advised in retrospect . Ambassador are nor against time and I wan na ask you just one final question . I think this goes to the heart of the debate on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ posed to the United States he has n't declared war on America . He has n't threatened to hurt America or pack America . If anything and he 's brutal I agree with you these are very brutal man he uses very brutal means . But he is the most effective . Ground force . In Syria to defeat and rolled back whether it be Al you know elmo 's route . Or Al al-Qaeda or crisis or the radical Islamic terrorists . So what ultimate threat does a sawed most of us . Well I think he poses multiple threats for us and our friends in the region the aside regime would not be empowered today without support from Iran . And looking at the conflict . In the region and what will happen once ice uses to see it is I think it will be next . Six to nine months . I think it 's important that we not allow Iran and its surrogates to come in with an even stronger position . Than before . And in that sense Syria remains at war with Israel . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does it is a threat to Israel and that 's one reason why . Prime minister Netanyahu was so supportive this morning . Trapped administration 's decision . But I think there 's a larger point to you know it yesterday . Was the 100 anniversary of the United States entering World War I on the most tremendous things it 's ever happened . And the one recollection . It 's probably the single most important thing Americans remember about World War I. Was the use of mustard gas the first use really in modern warfare poison gas of chemical weapons . And one of the first things we did in the Coolidge administration . After the war . It was tried put in place of prohibition on use of chemical weapons it was their first experience with a weapon of mass destruction . And the the impression that is left around the world . Landed a totalitarian . Regime like society uses of weapons of mass destruction and gets away with that . It 's something that I do n't think the United States can afford I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think that 's what our responsibility is . And I think this strike against that air base effectively destroying it as far as we can tell from early reports . Send this signal to any other country with chemical or biological weapons and perhaps even more importantly nuclear weapons like rot in North Korea . That unlike Barack Obama 's administration were not gon na sit . Back and let them develop and deploy these capabilities . If there 's any way to avoid it . So I just think that was a very important thing do I think it touched basic America 's national security interest and that 's why I think he the president did the right thing . We have been talking with former UN ambassador John Bolton . Ambassador I hope he 's still remain friends . Absolutely out about it except I cried and felt all right take care .

Well to it that the caught once more toward veterans affairs now of veterans they 're eligible for VA health care . Then they do n't . They do n't . The company and the tax credit program . All the Americans . Would would be able to actually shall hold the senate would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's meant to be seen I do n't know what the you Republicans and senate say they average count a couple thought norm knows what it is right now they 're writing . So congressman wordy you wan na see all of this go because we got ta have some kind of health care plan . Is it something you are gon na support . While you are well I supported eight early version though people care act that 's did three things one residents are health care . Because . You know the first time and artistry that there which are health care benefits was in obamacare . We got a system where we encouraged . Companies who offer high quality health care to their employees . You know from the 1960s forward now and all the sudden Obama it was started penalizing . Employers between so so I do n't support action . Health consequences of the you know a lot of unions are affected by . Congress I I take your word for this stuff because you have credibility with me because you told me waigel when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ VCR expensive it is an hour seeing it you were right . Trump said yesterday . I 'll read a bit although now now there 's still there 's still is it is six emigrated but it is readable you know especially a workshop of the existing plan you know that plan . It 's understandable so . You know . I really want to move it sits at RFI thought it accomplished . What we will open or I would 've supported but it does not . While trump says they yesterday that premiums and deductibles will go down Tellme wise he 's wrong in your right . Hey look at look at the technical reason for that . Eat eat eat in this in this open plan RC is doing away with all other Republicans still is doing a wayward . I 'll be essential benefits requirements so right now longer than what Iraq 's you have to cover . AB CB yesterday you know a whole list of things . And what 's the legal bills says there 's no you do n't attitude or you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so . If you 're one of the people for every young person in your program frequently called comprehensive plan right now . In the future if you can by eighty limited plan that as our last yeah you a preview we 'll go down . What you 'll get a lot less in terms of health care so that will liberties . Yes I believe get a lot less health care yet . So what what about the issue with the elderly though looks . Congressman because that 's when they do however keep saying this gon na shift older people who need health care a lot more than those young people you 're referring to him . Right well what Medicare the sure money away from Medicare . Or actually . Just a lot of money away from Medicaid . Which right now . So we 'll have to do that because of high quality health care we I thought it you 'll be possible . I would say up but actually going to be 7% of all Medicare right now people are n't settled up . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the guy happened one . They 're gon na shift more of a cost on to . Want to Massachusetts . And the new bill also the amount of people so we just had a huge expansion . Regarding expansion of people eligible to vote for Medicaid in Massachusetts . That is going to be capped a lot of people who were on Medicaid or else . So so that I will again have a higher impact in Massachusetts there 's some other states where the but the federal small . I did n't obamacare strip art 750 billion dollars from Medicare says 97 they whenever the numbers were . That 's that 's that 's correct that 's absolutely correct old and other reasons that I voted against that 750 billion hole or overturn years . What would happen if they 're . Was no trump care Stephen Lynch because we heard the numbers just today 220 counties last year . Had no options that 's now well over a 1000 we saw what am I Virginia where that knew what this pump not right that this thing is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Massachusetts . I think we will now true . All one plan on the exchange 11 . Where you can actually be seen . By doctors at the Brigham and Women 's Hospital in the most general which two of the best possible in the world so . You already saw providers and I ca n't provide care at these level . And they have a Adam backed away shots and the premiums going up . We kept delaying the Cadillac cast . Now the late April 2012 trick actually people but that was just an affordable . Tax on people that was what it amounts to a . It is what I like about you do n't congressman has several Texas like glitch has no credibility is cut congressional health care he 's got enough and stock is . I 'm on obamacare I hope I 'm right Houston that 's number one number two and let me let me get that little . So I might cost one of the Baltimore thousands of the year much in the quality of my health it was . Do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And every member of congress is on . It on the it will popular there . Federal employees . We used to be under the federal police help but wonder what I 'd love to . But now we 're on obamacare and I voted against obamacare I feel like I should n't have to be on . So we get a guy like Tim Kaine tweeting out you know redness pulling out of Virginia does what happened when trump starts messing around . You 're at least telling it like it is what it is that . Luck this stuff is happening because obamacare we set up to fail or at least it was kicking it down the curb to make somebody else actually fix it . And the choice what would which obamacare counted on was that if it stayed around long enough . It would sort of you know of inevitability would become too big to fail and then you would happen the next I would have to fix it any also thought to the next there would be Hillary . When it turned out it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well now we see what happened that does n't mean what 's happening is good or bad congressman but . What we do not always based on the statistics we 've heard . Doing nothing really is not an option right . Correct and correct doing mapping is not an option but your really got to make tough decisions . You know to try to introduce competition of these equations and rather than using massive subsidies . Under you know by the tax Payer . You know that that 's that 's not gon na work . And and it 's unsustainable . It 's unsustainable problem from the beginning unsustainable . And and you know the president did concede he should look this is imperfect as are gon na have an effect on . But the problem what it is often a very short time line to protect . Congressman it 's where forgets to break you stay with this for just a couple more minutes . Or thin and athletic or total congressman Steven lynch . After the break we 're gon na as a congressman know if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there and him about that if he chanted it 's delayed Hostin . Gets to work with Taylor . All right so we 're talking here Patterson 's . The lynch about health care and congressman I 've matured into the break your wanted to ask you . If you need a week we 're talking about this if you had your choice to go back to maybe 97 let 's say or 2012 . Or now . Are there any plans along the way there that you would rather go back to and start again where we urged where are you on this spectrum . Well actually I think we did n't have a solid plan are . Old or AM . That perhaps . I opened 300 polls . Why are soon see Scott Brown election remember that we we have built on the outs that we Asarco for the senate . Because we did n't get to sixty we did n't have people sitting all because . Because our round it beat the the attorney general . Up we we could n't get that app that bill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ antitrust exemption from a mature companies so they ca n't act in and break the people that . If it did n't tax union health plans are heights are quality health plans . And dot establish what was then called the state supported . What options so that . States could actually offer these low cost plans . And force the insurance companies to compete with those plants a look at strong element of competition and that that I would vote but that 's when it got voted for it not only did not vote or and a lot of Democrats but we had a a bunch of Republican does or it as well so I would support going back that 's why I think that one has its not perfect but . It 's a lot better than what I see so far . Do you think that 1997 Massachusetts was better than what obamacare was in what trump there will be . I I ca n't remember . There 's a teacher . I 've been well you know your premiums are lower you know your deductibles are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yeah I I think Matty or what I have a 37 . Percent that were uninsured allegedly the way they could walk into an emergency room and you covered and we were told that the cost of that was so we 're exorbitant . There we had to do something about a boy we now know that the cost . To insure them is like five times higher than what it was when they want insurer . But they were still again health care . Yeah I love it we have got our eyes back and you know what what what technology and proceeded to tap out a Smart I did have back . Miss them so stupid it straight up there right . That 's a tough question . So I 'll ask you the million dollar question were you were chanting and . And and now . Last night anonymous warmed up . I am not a center the fellow that set the expected . To act I 'm in the second rule by . I look but I a couple of arsenal . It . It would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the big goal of epic yet you get a majority out . Let out huge war church here and it was wild celebration . So the break every bit cool . And then on the other side of put it like it . The Democrats are back back to . Does that at all L. Back so that would be general breakdown call but that a particular way I hope people wo n't get . Up to date on that the real thing what happened . Let them in this field and you know the car shifting that that on that you 've really got to keep your eye on the ball that 's the beautiful stuff that happened . We will be doing is it so my follow up question of people Sam drawn soft balls that you say here comes another one . We you 're embarrassed by your party in any way yesterday and the reason why ask that won the champ at two . Bernie Sanders Elizabeth Warren etc. immediately take to Twitter and say people are now going to dot . I mean is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Well you know they . I currently out there op . I 'm not embarrassed by by by volley they were put all because of hearing that you know the Republican was like and what all . Ambassador to the democratic members respond but he kind . I ca n't I ca n't it was very emotional debate . And I do n't I do n't I do n't like I 'm not about art art market are certain that I was there or very heated . And it was important what are what I did n't . You know what I 'm cute said it would take quorum but it 's sort of broken down at that point arm as a heartbeat you know people that I thank . I do n't think you could actually point to . Specific persons safest person died because . 888 lack of health care under this bill . Certainly it it may . It nation it well so we will ship . You know cost arm from healthy people . Who can sicker people hate the younger people they remove the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ belong to churches . Helped yes so I think they estimate that about forty million people . Who currently required out here will decide not to because they 're relatively healthy . And doubt . And you know about that that will ship or with two . That the burden mall is sicker people a lot of people will actually have to ask health care . But I I do n't know that the small beyond that the dispute it does hurt a lot out here because of this bill . Offshore or died because of this bill because now . To be a time frame your best guess as to . Hey if B when this becomes law . Wow . I have a high enough time figuring out what goes on in the house . Vs the senate . I did have a brief talk with CE yet they do n't why . They 're not . They 're not sure . What 's the procedure rule . People what what extraordinary procedural measures might be available so the senate Republicans in this debate so I think this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without knowing what rules why it would be impossible to beat it give an estimate on our critic might be . Do you think congressman they 'll take time in Vail this wo n't just be pushed through as quickly as he came through eight feels like he came through anyway the house . Yeah via . It it 's definitely . It is it 'll take some Protestant wanted to thoughtfully . Take some time of when somebody Indies he says gon na take some time that I mean I 'm serious I 'm that concerns me . Yeah I do n't quietly . But other Republicans and they have eight hours on solar . In mind that and I also think they 'll get a lot of pressure from the veteran community . And at a particular . Demographics that are treated unfairly that is built so I think I think that the a lot of back and built the they 'll be under pressure exposed gaps . Are unrelated but book somewhat related I just as I think it 's all connected at this point we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spending bill deal was it the drug administration is they 're now saying or was it your party . I think the Democrats start the Politico that they 'll go a lot of tears . That 's sort of programs with the truck . So I would say . I would say the Democrats got the better of the deal because we we we expect that a lot worse . Adopt . So the worst that happened was that certain things were what platform that which . The Democrats took it went even though they knew it needed more money it 's those folk . Fact it was level on billions and it 's it was continued . They considered to deal we and under the circumstances so yeah I 'd I 'd give the it gets to the Democrat . Who am I wrong to look at this week in starting with that bill earlier in the sort of victory lap that the Democrats took him and watching the Republicans yesterday in the Rose Garden to say . How in the hell is there ever going to be anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ giving each other 's faces and one I. You like me now . Yeah that 's not good that 's not good because people remember when you when you embarrass somebody publicly . That they remember it it just breaks out so . I always going to be sort of you know a moderate someone who can actually carry our discussion what some of these Republican . There 're there 're some good folks on the outside that . A really been doing the right thing Bobby app the American people but the problem is that the energy at both parties really . At the street you know you 've got the extreme right extreme left . It 's sometimes . They created an environment that it is not conducive to compromise but . People what I 'm hoping is that they 're out of all this back and or debt . People realize that we 've got to come together we 've we 've we 've got some serious work to do we have some real challenges . And that like tax cuts are you gon na vote for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll tell you well do right now they do n't . It did that a couple of areas where I think we could get some things done this why it is fair to all that you mentioned . There 's also you know part of that is this . It 's . Profits repatriation . Bill which . So we have in a truly adult overseas . And we think that if we allow . Some of those American corporations that are in negative all what went straight environmentalists say . We allowed to bring that money home with a probably generate about a trillion dollars did . Tax revenue over the next ten years and that would pay for the infrastructure built that that the Republicans want to get them . And you know I think in other vote democratic bridges are n't Republican bridges there are right we ca n't we can go ahead and and get all that comes from people who work . We need it quickly heated and I think there are here quite active with people come together . Congressman I 'm gon na @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ music player and another thing I 'm night . Well you look great today and I thank you very much we appreciate all your time . Continued success there in Washington sir . All right thank you very much I let you that I was right when you meet a lot of it too .

Focus on job skills this is an article that was written by Douglas Belkin of the Wall Street Journal he 's good enough to join us today on the financial exchange . I Douglas welcome to the show . Her very good so how much debt arc kids graduating . With . From bitter graduating this may and from college a much better they carry . So although the recorders is that it directly to you 'll have yet the average amount to around thirty oh . OK so . Then it did so 75% of the kids graduating college had debt average amount 35000 dollars does that include that 35000 dollar number including the 25% that do n't have any debt . Now that 's just Q2 . Learn . OPEC are now with how is it changing I read your article it sounds like . Students . Are recognizing that hey . I you know I 'm not gon na get a job if I have a degree in anthropology and there 's say say or philosophy they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look good what agreement on you because might be certainly a underemployment . In schools and public graduate . The intersection of them but it in the the curtain back jumped me up put it more and more comfort that I ever called the look at . The yield technical field . The political reach who beat the mayor of the marketplace it go of it much time to . You know go what you 're gon na do after school and that it . Right now it sounds like a lot of the schools are transitioning over to health care majors so there there . You know the kids graduating to get a job in the health care this field . Yet the Bloomberg article that he could . Look after them and it could grow field so era as school retooling in and it 's flocking . How did the schools do that you know because traditionally you 've got many schools that were liberal arts schools . And now all of the sudden their transition over to accounting did business degrees . Computer science health care how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It 's a painful process a lot of schools because the ball up top actually you know sometimes I mean I yet quote liberal arts program . Outside a lot and he injured and no longer make adequate or that and a good luck with that being make the fact that he go . Apparently like it . You know prior to picnic is on call alert and we 're is . Go to going to be after graduation he enters your basement technical thing to have a better answer than added in the folks are looking pretty sort of I am programs be which has you know plot lemon . Were you mentioned a number of schools throughout the country that are changing their curriculum but one that was located in New England is Dartmouth . What is Dartmouth doing to their curriculum to change . If they could really you can program that was guarded by every . Adam and that could copy . If you think about because as being jitter is an economic boom love mine were COLT who clothing . The the country clipping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be at her what to do that they . What nick mark welcome . You know markedly that the film with a technical mix with a and that they need to income can handle that it could n't work with those numbers and it does n't restarting the program . There 's little empowered it to do that . Michael another school putting it weird . What more classic traditional . Leaders that humanity site . Courses . That . Where they . Douglas Kirk are connections breaking up but I have to let go but thank you very much for joining estate be the message they 're China is . It 's the the parents of the kids that are writing these . Silly checks of anywhere from . 25000 dollars a year to I do n't know what 's Dartmouth today 60065000 . Pro 6470 . All in somewhere in that ballpark would that . I think the parents are saying hey . I 'm not spend and 25 grand send you to college . And it unless you get a diploma that 's gon na help you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you graduate and I think even the kids are saying hey I do n't wan na I 'm not gon na go to school in and get a philosophy degree anymore because I. Can get a job . No it and I certainly think that this is one of the things that is weighing on the minds of people . Largely because of all the stories of the last five to seven years were people were coming out just with too much debt from the degree that they now I 'll services . And an and we know that this is how colleges operate if you go to any college admissions office and he walked in and say look how much of the cost educate your English students vs how much cost educate your engineers . The engineers are much more expensive educate there 's more . Equipment that 's involved is more facilities is more training that has to happen probably harder to get a professor prior to throwing more for an engineering professor than you do for history professor . I do n't know enough about that to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you that it is much more expensive educate engineers and you know involved sciences like that than it is to educate English or philosophy majors yet they all paid the same price the reason . Is that the English majors effectively subsidize your engineers will that means . You know getting great deal you 're going is an English major it 's not because . You might not come out with a job but you 're paying more than you should because you paying for someone else 's education effectively so . People need to know that and understand what they 're doing and so if it 's a situation where you want to be an English major will there 's nothing wrong with being an English major . But the might be something wrong with taking out a 100000 dollars in loans to be . You might be able to say okay if I can do this with 20000 in loans in the lower tier school our state school boy I can get the same degree but not have that same board know from my head so . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they say look why why pay to go to tufts for engineering when you mean you 're gon na study the same topics if you go to human muscle I mean you can make that argument about just about . Any degree that 's out there I think at these private schools are they on the demise they . The is the financial where are all gon na continue where people are going to be willing to spend . 6070000 . Dollars a year to send their kids to private school when they go to state school for 25 . I think for the top and yes OK I think that for the top and you are going to continue to see that because frankly . I do think it 's worth it not necessarily because the education is that much better is I think the education you get a lot of schools is very good but I think that the networking that 's done at the upper tier schools you just have a bigger network it 's in place okay . I do think that is you start getting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to be old we agree reckoning coming . As far as what those are able to charge I do n't think you gon na be able to see second and third tier schools continuing to charge 1560000 . Dollars a year . I think you 're going to see much more strategy occasion like we used to put a population of kids going to college is increasing right we learned that yesterday . More kids graduating college and they 're graduating high school Boone school . Today any time in the last every year wait until the millennial start to go you know this is going to be something mark tape now check in with me in the you know 1520 years of wait until the millennial kids start going to school cause they 're the ones that really started to bear the brunt of student loans you know because how much colleges gone house so they are graduating with 35000 dollar for a long I want passed on the their kids now you know and the 35000 . Member is the average a lot of kids grow and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 67 I knew when young lady kept graduated from Trinity College in Hartford Connecticut . Had a 100000 dollars and that it 's it 's it 's not easy and so I think you 'll see a major reckoning . With the next generation as it starts to go in.
