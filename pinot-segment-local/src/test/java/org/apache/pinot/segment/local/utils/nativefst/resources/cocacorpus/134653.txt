I 'm assuming that this is just some mistake I 've made during setup or something or a setting I can toggle or something . <p> I 'll post this now in case there is a simple fix ; in the mean-time , I 'll probably be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provide more details on what 's happening and will edit this reply when I get something . <p> Cheers on the help so far though . <p> EDIT : Alright , so a bit more progress now . I 've gotten it to work , although it feels like a work-around fix , so I 'm hoping there 's a better way . I tried switching it to Desktop capture mode , and it was giving me a message about DPI scaling . So I turned off DPI scaling for the runescape app : still broken . So I thought to myself , okay , since Alt1 is only capturing the top left of the screen , and since it just said something about scaling , maybe I can turn the scaling down for the whole computer and it can work . So I turned my scaling down here ( http : //runeapps.org/i/bsfd ) from 150% to 100% , and set it to DirectX capture again , and it seems to work now . It can find the home teleport button and everything , and pressing alt+1 actually seems to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small and my chrome tabs are tiny and I find myself starting to squint to read what I 'm typing . So I 'm hoping there is a better fix to this that you can see through what I 've done here . <h> Re : Failed to find the home teleport button in-game <h> Re : Failed to find the home teleport button in-game <p> It sounds like you have desktop scaling enabled , but at the same time disabled it for the runescape client . Having it enabled is supported , not having desktop scaling is supported , however having it partially enabled like that makes it very tricky . The problem is that there is way to find out what scaling is being used on the runescape client other than assuming its the same as the rest of the desktop . You could fix it by disabling the dpi override you have on the runescape client . However this would make it blurry again which is probably why you turned it off in the first place . <h> Re : Failed to find the home teleport button @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there . After a bit more research , it looks like this is a problem with Runescape and Windows rather than Alt1 . And that there 's no fix yet . So yeah . Thanks for the help though , I guess if I come upon a fix I 'll post it here , but otherwise there does n't seem to be a solution yet .

( Similar to the WoW addons ) <p> Well if it would be easier to code you could always leave the rotation to be set by the user according to what they want ?

I imagine a large number of people would use it , but I 'm sure some would complain about making the game too easy or something stupid like that . But it would be very helpful to lower level players getting into bossing by helping them optimize their dps while allowing them to focus more on the mechanics of the fight instead of concentrating so much on what order to use their abilities . Hell , as a 138 getting into end game bossing like Arraxor , I would even pay for that as a premium Alt1 app . <h> Re : Visual DPS rotation app ?

Either something is wrong with your capture settings , or the chatbox is n't visible or overlapped by something else ingame . You can chat if capture is working correctly by going to the capture tab in the Alt1 settings . If you send a screenshot of your chatbox ingame i can probably tell what is going wrong if it 's not the capture settings . 6480 @qwx416480 <p> It ca n't see anything outside the game window , so nothing at all when minimized and nothing outside the frame when you have your client like this . In this case some other the text will be cut off when you get a loot beam . It probably will work if you make the chat box the same size as your window . You can see exactly what alt1 is seeing if you go into the settings of your loot beam alerter . <p> It does work tho if there is another window in front of it so you can tab out to another program .

But I never was able to make the world map work for compass clues . <p> With the recent update I though I would give it another try ... and finally made a tiny breakthrough.My problem was always that I was n't able to make the map know which teleport I was trying to select.Instructions say " Press alt+1 over the rightclick of any teleport " ... but none that I try was working so I left it aside . <p> But recently I found that the comp cape teleports are working ! So I finally been able to see how it was suppose to be used ... And I tried other teleports . And nothing seem to work with it ! <p> At first I was thinking only about the teleport from my standard spellbook but does n't work.I would have loved the Home teleport -loadstone screen to work since it 's logic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does n't work.My comp cape work for Ardougne Monastery and Farming patch teleport ... yet the Ardougne Cloak 4 does n't work for these locations ? <p> Honestly it took me months to think about right-clicking cape might work for it , I only though about spellbook teleports and trying to make home teleport work . Is there a list somewhere of which teleport can be used so I can try to make a better triangulization ? Because ardy monsatery and farm patch are n't far enough for a good job . <p> Also any chances of them being added ? Desert amulet + comp cape + ring of wealth is usually what I use but my skill to put the arrow on a map are much more limited than alt-1 . <h> Re : How to use World map on Alt1 for compass <p> There are a lot of supported teleports . But now that you list them , it seems like I also missed a lot . I stripped the supported teleports from the code and pasted it below . I 'll check into the again and also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , like the games necklace . <p> Lodestones .

The annoying Proulxs whining about the teleports . <p> So I was reading the list to add some teleport to my markings to make them easier , and found that:Many teleport work only when worn like Nardah or Daemonheim because the text is reverse ; " Teleport to Daemonheim Ring of kinship " become " Ring of kinship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the crystal does n't seem to work .

It seems that older versions might get stuck in cache , so you might have to right-click the app-&gt;reload to get the update . The other teleports that you mentioned work for me , it might have been the same cache problem.I 'm always looking to improve , so keep coming with the teleports <h> Re : How to use World map on Alt1 for compass <p> Hi , I reloaded the app and now dungeoneering and nardah both work worn or not thanks . ( Edit : Now dg does n't work unworn weird ) <p> Digsite work worn or not , fairy ring and ectophial work perfectly , but explorer 's ring 4 only work when worn . <p> Lletya crystal and Port Sarim lodestone does n't seem to work for some reasons ... But I found out that if I alt-1 while " Teleport " is seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the lodestone on the lodestone map ) it will open a drop-list of all lodestone so you can pick one without having to actually teleport there , really useful thanks ! <p> Since Sarim was n't working I went on and tested other lodestone and they all seem to work . But I then started to test the standard , Zaros and Lunar teleports and found many not working : Camelot , Mobilishing Armies , God war dungeon , Trollheim ( standard spellbook , it work on lunar ) Ape Atoll , Dareeyak , Carralanger , Moonclan , Waterbird , Khazard , Fishing Guild and Ice plateau . <p> And I was looking at fairy rings and I found a way they could be used . It 's quite alot of work though and I would not really use them for clue hunting but I though I might tell you this if you wish to make the tool more versatile ; When you right-click a fairy ring from your favourite list or from the complete list on the right it show the code like : " A L S @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Re : How to use World map on Alt1 for compass <h> Re : How to use World map on Alt1 for compass <p> To make them work you have to mouse over the text of the teleport then hit alt-1 . But when they say " text " what is implied is the right-click drop list of the teleports . Normally the clue solver app should switch to map on the 2nd tool and display the name of the teleport . You then click that box when you arrive at destination . <p> As shown in this pic : <p> Right-click a teleport/accepted teleport item or the Home button on the map to display last lodestone used <p> Click Alt-1 while your mouse is highlighting it ( 1 ) <p> Click the button ( 2 ) once at the teleport arrival and after a second a red line should appear on the map <p> repeat few places and get approximate localization . <p> If this does n't help , which step is blocking ? You press alt-1 and nothing happens or ... ? if so which teleport are you trying and using which interface .

So to get it to work on arc I have to load the preset and then change the trigger at stance option to Sheathed . 6480 @qwx416480 <p> Using Afkscape app does n't tell you about your experience being shortened by a ' k ' or ' m ' like the exp/hr application does .

Again thank you for this wondeful app that you 've made 6480 @qwx416480 <p> Guys , if you harps chat or any other chat is n't working , it 's likely because you 're on legacy interface .

As soon as I swapped back to rs3 interface it worked just fine 6480 @qwx416480 <p> Scale , i could make one without to much trouble but i need some images of the wave number indicator . I just did wave 1-5 with a random preset before getting a dil without melee weapon . If you can post some images of the wave counter with number 6-10 on i 'll make it into an alerter . You can use alt+2 shortcut to make and upload the images then just paste the url here . 6480 @qwx416480 6482 @qwx416482 <p> Scale , i could make one without to much trouble but i need some images of the wave number indicator .

Thank you for the help again and ill let you know how well the feature works 6480 @qwx416480 6482 @qwx416482 <p> Just added it , have fun . It alerts at the jad waves and the dil waves atm , no way to change that as that would be some interface work and i should be studying right now . <p> Thank you so much ! Its so freaking awesome that you just added that so quickly . Whenever you 're done with exams and such is there any way you could make it so it alerts one wave before jad/dill waves ? That way I have a little more time to prepare and there 's no chance that due to not being right there to check , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so much it really is amazing how quickly you did this . Also at least with the current iteration i 'm seeing , it only alerts at the jad waves and not the dill waves . So its missing wave 5,19 , and 26 http : //imgur.com/a/whuF3 . Also again with those one wave before would be best . Thank you ! 6480 @qwx416480 <p> I forgot to update that text , the alert was triggering for those already.I 'm going to leave it at jad waves for now , you have about 5-10 sec to react before the first hit which should be enough . Otherwise i 'm afraid it will alert more waves than not and the jad alerts are like 50sec early . The progress bar also starts filling 3 waves before jad so it should at least give an indication of when to start looking . I 'll probably make an interface to choose the waves in the future but i 'm going to leave it at this for now .

If it 's running in the background with no app open there is no lag but as soon as I open afkwarden or clue solver I have unbearable lag . I 've tried everything I can think of and was n't able to fix it myself . What can I provide to someone here to assist me in fixing this ? <h> Re : Runescape is extremely laggy when I have an alt 1 app running <p> When using afkwarden make sure you do n't leave any alerters in the searching state ( they are stroked through ) . It is also worth checking in the Alt1 capture setting if it switched to desktop capture instead of directx or opengl . <h> Re : Runescape is extremely laggy when I have an alt 1 app running <p> Thanks for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is 5 alerters or 1 alerter so I think it is something with alt 1 as a whole vs that specific app . <p> I recorded a video of myself doing two steps of a clue . The first step is without alt 1 active and the second step is with alt 1 running with the clue solver app open . I 'm not sure how well you can notice the lag in the video but maybe it can give some insight into my problem . <h> Re : Runescape is extremely laggy when I have an alt 1 app running <p> I tried a couple of different things like forcing different parts of alt1 to crash but i ca n't find any way for this to affect the fps of rs . Judging from your video it also does n't look like the lag spikes are happening when Alt1 is capturing the screen . I expected to lose a couple of fps when opening multiple apps , but actually do n't see any change after 8 apps . <p> I think there is either a conflict with another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NET or Alt1 installation . <p> When the video freezes for like 2 sec in youtube , did rs also completely freeze for you ? It does n't seem like the RS client itself noticed as the fps did n't change . <p> Did your mouse actually freeze as well there ? <p> You seem to go from 80 to about 50 with the app open . Do you get the fps back after closing the app , but leaving Alt1 open ? <h> Re : Runescape is extremely laggy when I have an alt 1 app running <p> Skillbert , <p> I 'm still able to move my mouse freely but the entire rs client will freeze . I noticed that the fps did n't change very much . <p> Sitting idle in the game and running around a bit gives me between 170-220 FPS without Alt 1 running at all . When alt 1 is running with no apps/apps open my FPS remains unchanged but the client occasionally freezes . <p> Where should I look next regarding potential apps I 've installed that may cause this issue ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or . NET are not the issue ? ( I 've tried uninstalling and reinstalling alt 1 and have seen no improvements . <h> Re : Runescape is extremely laggy when I have an alt 1 app running <p> Do you get the lost fps back after closing the app but leaving Alt1 open ? - If you do get the fps back it probably means some weird problem with the built in browser. - If you only get the lost fps back after closing Alt1 or restarting rs it is probably a conflict with Alt1 and another capture/overlay program you have . In that case there should be no lag if you switch to desktop capture , turn off the automatic capture mode detection checkbox and restart rs . However desktop capture sucks for other reasons . <h> Re : Runescape is extremely laggy when I have an alt 1 app running <p> The FPS was n't dropping according to the game it was just constantly freezing . <p> I tried switching to desktop capture before to fix it but I only restarted alt 1 not the client and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ client makes it run how it used to . I ca n't minimize rs anymore though when doing afk skills so that 's a bit upsetting because it was something I used to do quite often . <p> This problem started about a week or so for me . The only thing I 've changed on my computer since then is the fact that I am playing osrs on osbuddy quite a bit . At first I thought osbuddy was lagging my rs3 client but it was n't . Is it possible an update came out from you or runescape recently that " broke " it for me ? I 'd really like to use opengl capture again so I can minimize the client if possible .

There is no way to keep track of anything inside the 3d rendered world , you ca n't know the camera position , the zoom level , the render setting , lag etc. even if Alt1 allowed you to keep track of user input . OSBuddy does this using injection which is against the rules in rs3 and will get you banned . The osbuddy client looks directly at the variables in the client and it 's overlays area rendered in the same context.The current ( shitty ) overlay system would be good enough to draw simple outlines of 3d objects on the screen , without involving the full 3d hardware rendering like tree.js does . The problem is just that there is no way to know where to draw them . <h> Re : Agility Course Markers <p> I think you misunderstand my goal . <p> None of the information I need would be grabbed from the RS3 Client . Rather it would be grabbed from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it would still have focus , i could handle mouse and keyboard events with javascript allowing me to mimic the movement as in runescape . This is not to say it would be perfect , it would require users to first align the 3d drawn object to the world as they see it , then from there , click a button which starts tracking for rotation and such through the webpage . If i can make it so that the webpage can be " clicked through " , or find some other method of sending the input to the client without memory interaction <p> Edit : From what I can tell , that is not possible unless you program something to mimic those specific keys or mouse functions . That would turn the application into a keylogger . However , it can still be manually tuned the first time as long as it 's re-tuned every time a camera angle is changed . <h> Re : Agility Course Markers <p> As you said , you ca n't track these events without making essentially a keylogger . Besides the angle you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somehow . <p> I think it would be easiest to just make a 2d app that assumes a certain camera angle . You could do some of the position tracking by reading the tooltip text when you click the next obstacle . ( You ca n't actually yet , but i 'm planning to add a rs clicked event at some point .

I 've seen a youtube video of it getting hacked with undocumented function in windows vista but nothing since that . This really sucks as the thumbnail seem to always work with zero resource impact . <p> What i 've been working on for nxt is converting the OBS ( Open Broadcast Software ) opengl capture code into something that gives single screenshots on request instead of blasting all frames towards your program . <p> Basically all game capture programs use injection to capture the games , this includes fraps , xbox game overlay , steam overlay , and OBS which means that Alt1 now also uses it . The dll basically intercepts call to the OpenGL api , so it stays far away from the actual game code . This approach seems to be accepted by jagex and they even did some slight hackery to make OBS work on NXT .

@@42044756 @2044756/ <h> Sync DgKey map between players <p> I love using DgKey , but one thing I think could improve it greatly is , if in a party with other people also using DgKey , your own map could be updated when they update theirs , and vice versa . For example , if I start going south out of the base room , I 'll mark all the doors along my way on the map . But every door that someone else encounters remains a question mark . Obviously that is n't a *huge* deal , since as long as at least one person knows what the doors are then it should be fine . But it would still be great if I knew the doors that I have n't seen , and for my map to get updated whenever someone else updates theirs . It would also be awesome if my map contained the location of other people 's gatestones . Maybe by having the gatestone symbol with that user 's color triangle marker on top of it ? That might conflict with some things though , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there 's obviously the issue from the technical side of things . I suppose one user would have to act as the " host , " and he would give out his IP address to the other 4 people in the party , and they could all type in the host 's IP to some field on DgKey . Then whenever a user in the dungeon updates their map , it sends a copy of that map to the host , who then sends it to everyone else , and updates all the maps to be the one that was sent . And rather than have the new map sent replace your existing one , just use it to update it . That is to say , only use the newest map to fill in undiscovered area on my own map , and keep information I have on my map that they have n't discovered yet . I 'll get their door key and keystone locations updated onto my map , while keeping my own . And next time I open the RS map , or add a keystone/door key @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while not overwriting other people 's keystone/door key locations , and send that version out to the host , who then sends it to the other players as well . And combine each update with Unix Epoch timestamp to know which is the most up to date . I think this would be an amazing update . <p> There are obviously a few issues , namely having to give out your IP address , which could be a large security risk . You 'd only really be able to do it with people you trust quite a lot , and if that 's the case you might all be in a Skype call together while DGing anyway . I also imagine this would be a lot of difficult work to implement , and would n't be a short-term thing at all . And it would really only benefit hardcore DGers , and I do n't know if I even count myself among them . But It would be an invaluable asset to those who have close groups of friends they DG with , I bet . <p> Sorry for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on anything I did n't explain well . I have no idea how hard this would be to actualize , and know it will probably be met with a resounding " no , " but man would it be cool to have your map get updated with information without having to add it yourself or open the RS map every time yourself . <h> Re : Sync DgKey map between players <p> I will have to disappoint you with the fact that i will not by coding this feature , the fact is this feature already exists <p> All you have to do to connect is click the globe icon after setting your party , this will connect you to the server and everyone with the same first player in the party list will be linked together .

@@42044797 @2044797/ <h> Dungeoneering critical path indicator <p> I think a cool feature for DGkey would be an indicator denoting whether or not a door is on the critical path or not . I 'm not hugely into being super efficient about DGing , but apparently determining whether a door is critical or not is apparently important to some people . <p> There are a number of ways of determining this without using guide mode , but a way I believe it would be possible for DGkey to determine would be reading the xp drops that appear upon opening them . Skill doors on the critical path are at minimum 9 levels lower than the level of the player with the highest level in that skill , and at maximum are the level held by the highest leveled player . that is to say , if at least 1 player on the team is Maxed , all skill doors on the critical path will require levels 90-99 . Xp gained upon opening skill doors is ( &lt;level of that door&gt; * 5 + 10 ) . So again , assuming at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ critical path will always drop between 460-505 xp . <p> DGkey can already grab all the levels of everyone in the party , so making another behind-the-scenes column that holds the highest level in each skill , and determines the xp that would drop from skill doors on that path seems easy enough . <p> The only issues I can see would be things like factoring bonus xp , and I do n't know whether the Scroll of Daemonheim LONG ... applies to skill doors , but I do n't think it does . The last issue , and probably the biggest , is determining which skill is actually getting the xp . The only way I can think of , without having an xp tracker open for every skill there is a skill door for , is to detect when that gold circle at the top of the screen with the skill icon in the middle pops up . Then look at what the highest level in the party for that skill is , and see if you gained xp that would fall in the critical value range for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I do n't know how reasonable that is though . Combined with the fact that if you 're 99 in that skill and do n't have a higher xp target set , you do n't get that circle icon anyway . So I 'm not sure how to detect which skill it is if that is the case . <p> One option to get around that is to just use the 460-505 values , and explain somewhere that it only works assuming at least 1 person on the team is maxed . Perhaps a much simpler , if much less versatile , solution . I ca n't imagine anyone really cares about finding the critical path if they 're not maxed anyway . <p> There is also the issue that while critical doors will always follow that formula , I believe non-critical doors can still have xp drops in that range as well . And I suppose it is possible for monster kills or other actions to generate xp drops in that range as well . So Any time your total xp increases by 460-505 really it 's just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> I made a dumb mockup of what could happen when a critical xp drop is detected , but it 's pretty bad : http : **32;12728;TOOLONG like a little circle in the corner that turns green is probably a much better idea though . <p> The more I think about it this whole thing is a pretty bad idea .
