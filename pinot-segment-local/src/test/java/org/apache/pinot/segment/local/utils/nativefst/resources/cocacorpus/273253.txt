The earliest reference to Yin and Yang is in the I Ching ( Book of Changes ) in approximately in 700 BC . In this work , all phenomena are said to be reduced to Yin-Yang . <h> Yin <p> Translations : <p> female , passive , negative principle in nature <p> the moon <p> shaded orientation <p> north or shady side of a hill <p> south of a river . <h> Yang <p> Translations : <p> positive , active , male principle in nature <p> south or sunny side of a hill <p> north of a river . <h> Four Main Aspects of Yin and Yang Relationship <p> Yin-Yang are opposites They are either on the opposite ends of a cycle , like the seasons of the year , or , opposites on a continuum of energy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only be spoken of in relationships . For example : Water is Yin relative to steam but Yang relative to ice . Yin and Yang are never static but in a constantly changing balance . <p> Interdependent : Can not exist without each other The Tai Ji ( Supreme Ultimate ) diagram shows the relationship of Yin &amp; Yang and illustrates interdependence on Yin &amp; Yang . Nothing is totally Yin or totally Yang . Just as a state of total Yin is reached , Yang begins to grow . Yin contains seed of Yang and vise versa . They constantly transform into each other . For Example : no energy without matter , no day without night . The classics state : " Yin creates Yang and Yang activates Yin " . <p> Mutual consumption of Yin and Yang Relative levels of Yin Yang are continuously changing . Normally this is a harmonious change , but when Yin or Yang are out of balance they affect each other , and too much of one can eventually weaken ( consume ) the other . <p> Four ( 4 ) possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yin <p> Preponderance ( Excess ) of Yang <p> Weakness ( Deficiency ) of Yin <p> Weakness ( Deficiency ) of Yang <p> Inter-transformation of Yin and Yang . One can change into the other , but it is not a random event , happening only when the time is right . For example : Spring only comes when winter is finished . <h> Yin and Yang Theory and History <p> Yin Yang is the fundamental principle , and the most important theory in TCM , underlying all physiology , pathology &amp; treatment . <p> Combining the two , we have the four stages of Yin and Yang ... <p> With addition of an extra line , the Eight Trigrams ( Ba Gua ) were formed , illustrating all the directions . <p> The Eight Trigrams were combined to form 64 hexagrams , symbolizing all possible phenomena of the Universe . <p> Yin Yang had been understood for many centuries , but was systematically elaborated and written down by Tsou Yen of the Yin Yang ( Naturalist ) School in the Warring States Period ( 476-221 BC ) . 5 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Naturalist school promoted idea of living in harmony with natural laws . Scholars of this school interpreted natural phenomena and observed how these are reflected in the human body in health and disease . Yin and Yang and the Five Elements became an integral part of Chinese philosophy . <p> The ancients observed 2 phases of constant cyclical change . Yin constantly changes into Yang &amp; back into Yin again . This can be seen in the changes of four seasons , and the changes throughout a single day ( 24 Hour Cycle ) , as seen below . <p> Front is more soft and vulnerable ( Yin ) . Back contains spine that holds ribs : protection . When human depicted as crouching , back receives sun ( Yang ) and front faces the earth ( Yin ) , is in shade and is protected . <p> All Yang channels ( except the Stomach channel ) flow on the dorsal or dorsolateral surface of the trunk and limbs . They carry Yang energy and protect the body from pathogenic factors . Yin channels flow on the anterior or anteromedial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Head <p> Yang channels either end or begin on the head . Acupuncture points on the head can be used to raise Yang energy . When Yang energy is not cooled by Yin , it may rise to the head , causing signs such as red face and eyes . The head is easily affected by Yang pathogens such as heat and wind . The chest and abdomen ( Yin ) areas are more easily affected by Yin pathogens such as Cold and Dampness . <p> Interior and Exterior <p> The exterior of the body such as the skin and muscles is more Yang . The exterior protects body from attack by external pathogenic influences such as Cold , Wind , etc . The classics state : " Yang is on the outside and protects Yin " . <p> Structure = something substantial , i.e. Matter ( Yin ) Function = something insubstantial , action , energy ( Yang ) All parts of the body have a structure ( a physical form ) , and a function ( their activity ) However , all is relative .

More like " thicker " form of Qi . <p> Note : there are several types of Qi . Each is relatively more Yin or Yang . Ancestral QI ( more Yin , more slow moving . Moves in long slow cycles ) . Ying Qi ( more Yang than Ancestral Qi , moves with Blood with which it is closely related ) . Ying is more Yin than Wei Qi . Wei Qi the most Yang form of Qi .

Many of the herbal formulas from these two texts are not only very elegant , but still useful today . <h> Tai Yang ( Initial Yang ) Syndromes <p> The Tai Yang syndrome corresponds to the initial invasion of the external Cold Evil through the pores and interstices of the skin . <p> General symptoms : <p> Headache and Stiff Neck <p> Chills and Fever <p> Floating Pulse <p> The stiff neck and headache will be located @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) areas of the body . The floating ( superficial ) pulse is located in the exterior , and with the finger raised , it has a surplus , when pressing down it is insufficient , weak , or disappears . When pressure is released , it regains full strength . <p> A fever ensues when the strong Zheng ( Upright ) Qi of the body engages the Wind-Cold invasion ( Cold Evil ) at the surface level of the body . Tai Yang syndrome fevers are relatively mild because the invading cold is weak compared to the body 's Wei ( Defensive ) Qi , as it is in the initial stage of entering the body . <p> If the cold evil becomes stronger because the Wei ( Defensive ) Qi is weak or easily depleted , the fever will increase as the pathogen penetrates deeper into the Yang Ming or Shao Yang channels . The Tai Yang fever is generally accompanied by chills , at least in the initial stages of the invasion . <p> Nasal discharge and sneezing are not included in the general symptoms for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Syndrome <p> Febrile Disease caused by Wind ( External Deficiency ) <p> Symptoms : <p> Fever - From Wei ( Defensive ) Qi fighting with the Evil Qi <p> Easily Perspires - From the inability of the body to keep the pores closed due of Lung Qi Deficiency - Also the bodys attempt to relieve the fever and heat <p> Pulse : Moderate Floating ( superficial ) pulse . The pulse is moderate ( as opposed to strong ) as this is a deficiency condition - the patient perspires easily . Consequently the pulse is not as rapid ( as in an excess condition ) . <h> Yang Ming ( Greater Yang ) Syndromes <p> As the pathogenic factor invades the interior of the body in the Yang Ming stage , both the Zheng ( Upright ) Qi and the Evil ( Xie ) Qi are strong , turning the excess pathogen in to heat within the body . Yang Ming fevers are therefore more severe than fevers in the Tai Yang stage . In the Yang Ming Syndrome , there are no chills .

This is due to the heat drying the fluids , causing Qi Stagnation in the organs <h> Shao Yang ( Lesser Yang ) Syndrome <p> The Tai Yang stage involves Evil pathogens ( Cold , Wind ) on the exterior of the body which need to be released or " sweated out .

The related channels of the Shao Yang syndrome are the San Jiao , Gallbladder , Pericardium , and Liver . <p> Symptoms : <p> Alternating chills and fever - It was believed that fevers corresponded to the body 's Zheng ( Upright or Good ) Qi fighting and winning against the pathogenic Evil Qi , and that Chills indicated that the body 's Zheng Qi was losing the fight against the pathogenic Evil Qi . <p> Pain in the costal ( hypochondriac ) region - The costal region is the region of the Liver so as the Meridian flow is disturbed , so is this area . <p> Irritability , Heart Vexation , and irregular heart beat . - This corresponds to the Pericardium channel being affected .

Six Meridians are located on the upper portion of the body , and start or end on the fingers . The other six Meridians are located on the lower portion of the body and end or start at the toes . Which gives us the following relationships : <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we get the following ... <p> Channels <p> Abbreviations <p> Pathway <p> 3 Yin Meridians of the Hand <p> ( LU , HT , PC ) <p> Chest to Hand <p> 3 Yang Meridians of the Hand <p> ( LI , Sl , SJ ) <p> Hand to Face <p> 3 Yang Meridians of the Foot <p> ( ST , BL , GB ) <p> Face to Foot <p> 3 Yin Meridians of the Foot <p> ( SP , KI , LV ) <p> Foot to Chest <p> As you can see , so far , the Meridians have been classified into a division of two groups according to Yin and Yang , hand and foot , and as coupled pairs . We are going to classify the Meridians according to the traditional Chinese idea of the cycle of Qi within the Meridians . The Chinese determined that the energy flows from one meridian to the next in a continuous and fixed order . It flows from meridian to meridian in a two-hour cycle , making the complete circuit once a day . <p> This cycle is known as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the meridians , each meridian in turn , with its associated organ , has a two-hour period during which it is at maximum energy . The Horary Effect is recognizable by measurable increases of Qi within an organ system and meridian during its time of maximum energy . ( Qi is , of course , present within every organ system all the time ; its level simply fluctuates according to the Horary Cycle . ) <p> If a person moves from one time zone to another , the resultant " jet lag " is a result of the biological Horary clock adjusting to the new time frame . Moving East or West causes this phenomena , but moving due North or South has no effect on the internal clock . <p> Just as each organ system has a waxing and waning two hour period of maximum energy on the Horary Cycle , there is also the minimum energy effect of the organ on the opposite , side of the cycle , 12 hours apart . i.e. - While the Lungs have maximum energy from 3-5 AM , the Bladder on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ energy level , 3-5 PM . Qi begins entering the Lungs at 3 AM , and has reached its maximum concentration in the organ at 4 AM . By 5 AM it has done its tonification and repair work and is moving into the Large Intestine channel . <p> Knowledge of this cycle and its energetic effects is necessary for highly effective acupuncture treatments , as the various organs respond either very well or very little to acupuncture depending on their energetic state at the time of treatment . The Horary Cycle is an excellent diagnostic tool and will be dealt with on the diagnostic level later in this course work . <p> The flow of energy begins with the Meridian of the Lungs and completes its cycle with the Liver , to commence again at the Lungs , continuing the daily cycle throughout an individual 's life span . The reason that the Chinese say that the flow begins with the Lungs , is that they consider the first independent function of a child at birth to be its first breath . <h> Circulation of Energy Through the Primary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3 AM to 5 AM <p> Large Intestine <p> 5 AM to 7 AM <p> Stomach <p> 7 AM to 9 AM <p> Spleen <p> 9 AM to 11 AM <p> Heart <p> 11 AM to 1 PM <p> Small Intestine <p> 1 PM to 3 PM <p> Bladder <p> 3 PM to 5 PM <p> Kidney <p> 5 PM to 7 PM <p> Pericardium <p> 7 PM to 9 PM <p> San Jiao <p> 9 PM to 11 PM <p> Gall Bladder <p> 11 PM to 1 AM <p> Liver <p> 1 AM to 3 AM <p> As you can see in the table of Classical Order of Meridians , the energy flows from one Channel to its coupled pair , and then on to the next coupled pair . The following is a diagram showing the order of energy circulation through the meridians . <h> The Twelve Meridians - In Classical Arrangement <p> Hand Yin Lung Meridian ( LU ) <p> Hand Yang Large Intestine Meridian ( LI ) <p> Foot Yang Stomach Meridian ( ST ) <p> Foot Yin Spleen Meridian ( SP ) <p> Hand Yin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Meridian ( SI ) <p> Foot Yang bladder Meridian ( BL ) <p> Foot Yin Kidney Meridian ( KI ) <p> Hand Yin Pericardium Meridian ( PC ) <p> Hand Yang San Jiao Meridian ( SJ ) <p> Foot Yang Gall Bladder Meridian ( GB ) <p> Foot Yin Liver Meridian ( LV ) <p> The Governing Vessel ( DU ) , also called the Du Mai , or Du Channel <p> The Conception Vessel ( REN ) , also called the Ren Mai , or Ren Channel <p> A Yin meridian joins its Yang coupled meridian ( and vice versa ) in the extremities , either the fingers or the toes . Yin meridians of the Hand terminate in the fingers . Yang meridians of the Hand begin in the fingers . Yang meridians of the foot terminate in the toes . Yin meridians of the foot begin in the toes . <h> Notes : <p> Although the Governing Vessel is of Yang nature and the Conception Vessel of Yin nature , these two are not , strictly speaking , a coupled pair in the same sense of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the coupled pairs of primary meridians have specific channels of communication , which join them together . These are the Transversal Lo vessels . The Conception and Governor Vessels do not have Transversal Lo vessels , but rather connect all the Yin channels ( Conception Vessel ) or Yang Channels ( Governor Vessel ) respectively . <p> Each Principal Meridian has its own Transversal Lo vessel . These are actually crosswise connecting channels , known as anastomoses . Since each Principal Meridian has one Transversal Lo , each coupled pair of P.M.s is linked by two of these . ( The one exception is the Heart channel , which is linked to the Small Intestine by only one Transversal Lo vessel . We could consider the Transversal Lo vessels as the horizontal or transversal pathways of the Meridians . <p> Understanding the energetic function of the Meridians is the Chinese equivalent of understanding the function of the organs in Western Medical thought . The meridians are connected with , and have their origin in , the internal organs : treating a meridian effects the organ to which it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ utilizing the acupuncture points along the meridians to achieve the desired effect . <p> The practice of acupuncture rests upon the relationship that exists between a specific area on the surface of the skin and a particular organ or energetic function . The needles or stimulus acts directly on the meridian , which in turn affects the associated organ . The more appropriate the selection of the points on the meridian , the better the treatment results . Within the 12 Meridians and the two Extra Vessels lie the majority of acupuncture treatment technique . <p> The series of acupuncture points upon the skin , which constitute the outward line of the meridian , are primary evidence of the meridians existence although the meridians themselves are invisible . Acupuncture point locators indicate the difference in electrical resistance that exists around acupuncture points . The traditional methods of locating the points are by locating specific anatomical landmarks , using special methods of measurement which are valid for any human body , and by finger sensitivity . Finger sensitivity is necessary in many areas of acupuncture practice ; locating the points , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Qi is exerting on an inserted needle , feeling ( palpating ) for sensitized areas of damage on the body . <p> The meridians provide communication lines between external body appendages and surfaces and the internal organs ; upper and lower parts of the body ; and provide for the circulation of energy . They govern the body 's ability to function , carry Qi , and so contribute largely in the maintenance of health . This energy can be manipulated at stations along these communication lines , the acupuncture points along the meridians . <h> General Pathways of the Meridians <p> The circulating pathways of the twelve Meridians flow from the face to the feet , from the feet to the chest , from the chest into the hands , and from the hands back to the face . The Yang Meridians generally flow along the outward ( lateral ) side of the limbs and along the back of the body . The Yin Meridians pass along the inward ( medial ) side of the limbs and along the front of the body . It has already been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are called Hand Meridians , and those that descend to the legs or ascend from the legs are the Foot Meridians . <p> The three Yin hand meridians travel from chest to hand ; the three Yang hand meridians , from hand to head ( face ) . The three Yang foot meridians travel from head to foot ; and the three Yin foot meridians travel from foot to chest . This describes the circulation of energy over the entire body and delineates the pathways in which Qi , or energy , flows . <p> With the arms raised over the head palms facing forward , the energy in the three Yin Hand Meridians ( Lung , Heart , and Pericardium ) will be flowing from the chest to the fingertips , upward along the forward portion of the arm . The energy in the three Yang Hand Meridians ( Large Intestine , Small Intestine , and the San Jiao ) will be flowing from the fingertips , downward on the back part of the arm , to end their flow in the face . <p> From the head , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Foot ( the Bladder and Gall Bladder , but not the Stomach ) will be traveling down along the side or back of the body and outward side of the leg to end in the toes . To complete the cycle , the energy in the three Yin Meridians of the Foot ( Spleen , Liver and Kidney ) will be traveling up from the toes along the inward side of the leg , continuing along the front of the abdomen and ending in the chest , at which point the cycle begins again from the chest to the hand . There are exceptions to this , but the general pattern is accurate . <p> The Stomach Channel is one exception . Although it is a Yang Meridian , it runs on the front of the body with the Yin Meridians , instead of up the back like the rest of the Yang Meridians . The other exception is the Governor Vessel , which is a Yang Meridian in the center of the back , in which energy flows upward as opposed to the rest of the major Yang Meridians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or Du Mai ( Du or GV ) , follows the spine upward on the back , travels over the head and ends on the inner surface of the upper lip . It has no direct connections to any internal organ . Its energy flow is Yang and ascends from the bottom of the pathway beginning near the anus . It connects with all the Yang Meridians of the body , and is important in many conditions requiring manipulation of the Yang energy of the body . <p> The Conception Vessel , or Ren Mai ( CV or Ren ) travels up the midline in front of the body . It runs from near the anus to the mouth , and its energy is Yin , ascending from the lower body to the upper , as does the Governing Vessel . In effect , these two meridians vertically encircle the body on its midline , front and back . <p> These two Vessels are not bilateral . They do not form a direct part of the organ meridian 's energy circulation network , nor are they associated with any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The energy traveling from the chest to the fingertip is predominantly Yin energy . Yet on its way back up the other side of the arm , it becomes Yang energy . The energy changes polarity , from Yin to Yang , or from Yang to Yin , the nearer it approaches the extremities of the limbs . <p> The energy traveling from the chest to the fingertip begins as predominantly Yin energy , but as the energy approaches the extremity the polarity begins to change , and by the time the tip of the finger is reached the Yin becomes progressively mixed with the Yang energy . Energy traveling from the fingertips to the face begins as mixed Yin/Yang , but by the time it arrives in the face it is predominantly Yang energy . <p> Energy traveling from the face to the toes begins as predominantly Yang energy . As this Yang energy approaches the lower extremities of the leg , the polarity begins to change again . By the time the toes are reached the Yang energy is mixed with the Yin energy in almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chest causes the transformation again . This Yin energy then flows back into the arm , to continue the cycle . <p> It can be seen , therefore , that as Qi circulates through the Primary Meridians , it alternates in coupled pairs of Yin and Yang Meridians , staying for two hours in the Yin and two hours in the Yang , in a smooth alternating rhythm . <p> In the central area of the head and chest , even though the energy passes from one Channel to another , there is no polarity change . The head is the area where one Yang meridian joins another Yang meridian , and the chest is where each Yin meridian joins another . <p> The polarity change is not a sudden thing , but occurs gradually , mostly between the elbow and the fingertips , and between the knee and the toes . Therapeutically , it is at points below the knee and below the elbow that energy polarity changes can be most easily accelerated or retarded . Within these limits , the most important control or energy manipulation acupuncture points @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appear as thin surface lines connecting a series of dots that represent the acupuncture points . Actually , there is much more to each meridian than what is shown in the acupuncture charts and diagrams . Every Channel has an inner pathway and an outer pathway , and it is usually the outer pathway with its acupuncture points that is shown on most charts or drawings , and the inner pathways are not accessible to manipulation by needling . <p> The true extent of the Meridians can not be shown by lines on a two-dimensional drawing . On a drawing the lines show us an imaginary line from point to point , which usually represents the approximate centerline of the sphere of influence of that Channel . According to the Chinese , each Channel is connected to all the tissues , organs and functions over which its acupuncture points have an influence or produce an effect , whether in the immediate area of the points or at a much distant area . <p> i.e. - Examine the Heart Meridian with its nine acupuncture points running from the armpit down the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little finger , very close to the surface . This much is shown on standard Meridian charts and most diagrams . However , the Heart Meridian naturally must be connected to the Heart , so it extends internally from the armpit point to the organ of the Heart itself . But , the Heart Meridian also has several other branches deep inside the body . One runs to the Small Intestine , and another branch connects to the head , specifically with the eye , tongue and brain . 
@@4519654 <h> Origins &amp; History of Chinese Medicine <h> Origin of Theory <p> The origin of TCM theory is lost in prehistory , before writing was invented . Written language started in China during the Shang Dynasty in 1766 BC . The writings on medicine at that time project back in history over two thousand years . Ancient works are alluded to in the prehistoric period , but are now lost as " legendary " . <h> Origin of Channels and Points <p> One current theory of how acupuncture points were discovered can be traced back to Stone Age . It is thought that stone knives and sharp tools were used to relieve pains and disease . Often these were used just for lancing boils and primitive surgery , however it is thought that patients may have noted sensations or changes on other parts of the body subsequent to treatment with these " needles " . Later these needles were replaced by bone or bamboo . <p> Other interesting theories : <p> Warriors in battle were hit by arrows and noticed conduction of pain to other areas of the body and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ became tender/discolored when disease was present . <p> Constipation was frequent , owing to primitive Stone Age diet . People found certain points tender when constipated and that manipulating them with pressure or pricking them brought relief . <p> Relief of pain was found when heat was applied ( after fire was discovered ) . This treatment became more specific at certain areas as results were noticed . <p> Monks would notice energy moving in specific areas when they would perform meditation techniques . Over centuries these energy movements were painstakingly noted , and the channel system was gradually elaborated . <p> Whatever the exact origin , acupuncture is not exclusive to China . However , only in the East was it so highly developed . This occurred because of observation by ancient Chinese over hundreds and even thousands of years . It was noted that : <p> An individual point could affect many different symptoms . Symptoms could be treated that were near to and distal from the actual point itself , including internal organ pathology . It was natural therefore to assume that points with common symptomatology could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extended over a considerable distance within the body . This was confirmed by the transmission of needle sensation along specific pathways . <p> A therapeutic property could be achieved by a number of different points . From this evidence they inferred the existence of channels and the flow of Qi along them . As location and therapeutic characteristics of points was gradually discovered , they were named . <h> Philosophical Roots <p> TCM is heavily rooted in traditional Eastern philosophy . The philosophy was not a single one and did not originate in only one era of Chinese history , but was built on , added to , and modified throughout history . This is very typical of the Chinese , who are a very pragmatic people . They have no problem accepting a wide variety of philosophies into their culture and not seeing any conflict between them . An example would be The Three Teachings : Taoism , Confucianism and Buddhism coexisted harmoniously in China : we can see them together in paintings , with Lao Tzu , Confucius and Buddha all depicted together . <h> Shamanistic Medicine <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bronze Age . First civilization proper . They had developed writing and had religion : their deity was called Shang Ti , who lived in heaven in imperial court populated with dead ancestors . <p> Ancestor worship was very important ( and actually is still ) in China . Rituals with ancestral bronzes were performed . Shang already had high-tech bronze casting : bronzes cast with incredible atavistic animal forms . Animals were accorded great respect for their power ; this shows in art . <p> The Shang believed illness resulted from : <p> Upsetting an ancestor and being cursed <p> Demon " evil " enters body ; Curing involved placating ancestors by suitable rituals or asking their help to expel the demon <p> Shamans were mediators who talked to the ancestors , who in turn talked to Shang Ti . Questions were asked by writing them on " oracle bones " , usually scapula bones or tortoise shells , which were then heated and the cracks were " divined " , in other words , read by a shaman to find an answer . Questions ranged from " Will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " <p> One problem with history is that it relies on archeological finds and writings ; however , what was written about this era was found on ritual bronzes and shells , the possessions of the rich ( bronze was very expensive ) . <p> Throughout early history , therefore , we have the problem of not knowing the medicine of the simple folk , since those doing the writing were educated and wealthy . <p> As late as 6th century BC physicians were still linked with shamanism . Demonology and shamanism persisted through the next Dynasty ( Chou : 1122-403 ) . <p> Even today the " Six Evils " or six kinds of " perverse energy " persists in TCM theory , except now they are environmental energies , i.e. , wind , cold , dampness , heat , summer heat and dryness . <p> In some areas of the East , shamanistic medicine survived almost intact , e.g. parts of Vietnam and esp . Tibet . <p> Chou Dynasty ( 1122-403 BC ) <p> A high point of Chinese civilization , but during the Eastern Chou @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aristocracy began fighting , among themselves , and social order degenerated into the Warring States Period , a time of great instability . <p> However , the unstable times produced great thinkers : ( Confucius was born in 551 BC ) . Different philosophies dating back into antiquity were investigated for possible solutions to the present problems . This was the time of the " Hundred Schools " , referring to the many philosophical schools of thought that prevailed . Much was actually recorded during this period of time , incorporating different philosophical ideas . <p> The major medical classic , the Huang Ti Nei Ching ( Yellow Emperor 's Classic of Internal Medicine ) was written down at this time from earlier knowledge . This is the most important of the medical classics . ( Shortly thereafter , China was unified again under the harsh and repressive Chin Dynasty ) . <p> There follows a brief examination of two major philosophical influences that influenced thinking ( and medicine ) during this crucial period . <h> Confucius ( K'ung Fu-tzu ) ( 551-479 ) <p> Born at end of Eastern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know about him from the " Analects " , a series of passages written by his disciples . <p> Brief biography <p> He wanted to be an advisor to a monarch . He traveled around in search of a monarch , but no one wanted his ideas ; he was too moral . Everyone wanted pragmatic techniques for use in winning the wars . He therefore became a teacher . Not until 200 years after his death were his ideas taken seriously . Eventually his ideas became the imperial creed . Confucian classics : these include the Li Ching ( book or rites ) and the I Ching ( a more ancient text which he developed and for which he wrote commentaries ) . <p> Confucius ideas <p> Social unrest was all due to the breakdown of respect . Respect for the hierarchy ( familial and imperial ) . He believed one should behave as one is supposed to according to one 's station in life , and not to be ambitious . He envisaged a harmonious society kept together by a tight hierarchical system of precisely defined social roles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a sage , who ruled by example : laws would then be unnecessary . People should be bound by respect for rituals ( li ) and customs . <p> He stressed honor , the importance of being a gentleman-scholar ( Jun Zi ) , learning , ( especially from history ) . He stressed also " ren " , in other words , compassion and humane action . <p> He emphasized filial piety and the Five Relationships ( a system of social mores that would establish social order ) . For example , ruler-subject , father-son , husband-wife , older brother-younger brother , friend-friend . <p> Finally , he stressed moderation . His disciples stated : " Confucius did not go to extremes . " <p> How Confucian Ideology Affected Chinese Medicine <p> Passage written by Hsun-Tzu , a famous disciple of Confucius : <p> " The true ruler begins to put his state in order while order still prevails ; he does not wait until insurrections have already erupted . " <p> Passage in the Nei Ching ( Chinese medical classic ) <p> " The sages do not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those who are not yet i 'll . They do not put their state in order only when revolt is underway , but before an insurrection occurs . " <p> The Confucian idea of moderation shows up in the Nei Jing in several passages . In other words , health would be maintained by moderation in lifestyle . <p> The Five Relationships also influenced medicine : Example : Husband-Wife imbalance ( which is where the pulses at one wrist are too strong and at the other wrist too weak ) : Certain techniques are also called Mother-Son and Father-Son technique . <p> The Zang Fu ( Organs ) are given names of " officials " . For example , Liver is the " commander " of the armed forces . The Heart is the Supreme Ruler , the Stomach is the official in charge of public granaries . The court ( body ) runs well when all the officials ( organs ) interact harmoniously . Of paramount importance is the Supreme Ruler or Emperor ( Heart ) . If the Emperor is disturbed , the whole court ( all the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of thinking , the Supreme Ruler has to remain in perfect balance , and to rule by example . Even today , it is considered by many that the Heart is to be treated first if it is affected ( e.g. in emotional disturbance , the Heart is always affected ) . <h> Taoism <p> Taoism is not a religion , more a philosophy based on the concept of Tao . Sometimes said to mean " the way " , or something like unknowable , unimaginable , source of all phenomena . Before Tao there was chaos , then suddenly Tao manifested as the universe ( comparable to the modern " big bang " theory ) . Tao expresses through the duality of Yin-Yang . Tao is like the eternal primeval law of nature . <p> The best known ancient Taoist philosopher was Lao Tzu ( Lao Tzu = " Old Master " ) . He wrote the Tao Te Ching : a mystical Taoist work , full of poetic allusions , riddles , etc. to expand consciousness , promote love of nature and simplicity , and rejection of worldly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , probably dating from 3rd century BC ( the same time that the major medical classic , the Nei Ching , was officially written down ) but Lao Tzu has had his traditional dates fixed to make him slightly senior to Confucius ( i.e. , 6th century BC ) . It is impossible to know the exact birth date . <p> The best introduction to Taoism is to read some Taoist literature . The way the ancient Taoists ' would teach would be via observation of the nature , in the hopes of obtaining a direct grasp of the truth . Most mystical or inner-directed spiritual paths concur with this . <p> In Chapter 1 of the Tao Te Ching , Lao Tzu wrote : <p> The tao that can be told is not the eternal Tao <p> The name that can be named is not the eternal Name . <p> The unnamable is the eternally real . Naming is the origin of all particular things . <p> Free from desire , you realize the mystery . Caught in desire , you see only the manifestations . <p> Yet mystery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is called darkness . <p> Darkness within darkness . The gateway to all understanding . <p> Taoism espouses " wu-wei " which means not doing , or non-purposive action . Being without plans , going with the flow . Not surprisingly , Taoism was a popular philosophy mainly with the aristocracy ! <p> To seek learning one pains day by day To seek the Tao one loses day by day <p> Losing and yet losing some more Till one has reached Wu-Wei <p> Do nothing and yet there is nothing that is not done . <p> To win the world one must attend to nothing . When one attends to this and that He will not win the world . " <p> An example of working with the Tao is given in a traditional tale of a Prince Wen Hui and his cook . Prince Wen-Hui was visiting his kitchen one day when he happened to pause and observe his cook slicing through joints of meat . He remarked upon the deft and smooth way his cook worked , the blade hardly seeming to touch the bone as it cut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ non-purposefully allowed the knife to do its work . In this way , he became one with his knife , which slid through the spaces between the joints , never touching the bone . He explained that he had used the same knife for many years and it had never needed sharpening . The prince was astounded at his cook 's story , and exclaimed that although he was an avowed Taoist , he had truly learned something fundamental about the philosophy from his cook . <p> Taoists advocated simplicity , living according to the Tao , according to the laws of nature . <p> The Chinese medical classics speak with reverence of sages of ancient times , who knew how to live according to the Tao , hence they lived very long lives . Whereas nowadays ( 3rd century BC ) people had lost the ability to live in harmony with nature , did not adhere to the principles of moderation , and hence were unhealthy . One wonders what they would say about the 20th century ! <p> Taoism eventually split into two camps : alchemical Taoism , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , meditation and magical herbs , and popular Taoism , which developed a church and a whole pantheon of gods , and became heavily involved with popular superstitions and demonic lore , thus losing credibility with the educated class . Earlier Taoist classics , however , continued to be read . <p> Taoism had a strong influence on medicine : the idea of humans being part of nature and needing to remain in harmony with nature was fundamental . " As above , so below . " As an example of this , guidelines were established in the Nei Ching as to how one should conduct oneself in various seasons . In the winter time , one should go to bed early and get up late , and not waste one 's energy , for winter is the time of conservation and storage ( a time where Yin is strongest ) . In the summertime one should rise early and go to bed late and " act as if one loved everything outdoors " , for Summer is the time of maximum Yang , and people 's naturally have more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Warring States period , the time of great social unrest where uncertainty about personal and collective existence , increasing chaos and amorality led to the search for a lasting philosophy that might change things . The time of the " hundred schools " . The medicine that developed during this period of intense philosophical activity is the central part of what traditional Chinese medicine is today . It has been referred to as the medicine of systematic correspondences . <p> Medicine of Systematic Correspondences <p> The fundamental principles of this medicine arose from divergent influences , including Taoist and Confucian ideas . The Naturalist School was responsible for systematically elaborating the concepts and theories of Yin-Yang , which had been an ancient idea that was now fully developed and recorded . <h> Huang Ti Nei Ching Su Wen Ling Shu <p> During the time of the " Hundred Schools " , ( 3rd century BC ) , the famous classic of TCM , the Huang Ti Nei Ching ( Yellow Emperor 's Classic of Internal Medicine ) was written down in its present form . <p> It had existed far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handed down by word of mouth , and is thus a compilation of much earlier material , with added commentaries ( commentary writing is very popular with the Chinese ) . The " Nei Ching " as it is called , is a mixture of ideas and philosophies , some more ancient ( i.e. Taoist philosophy ) and some from the time it was written ( 3rd century BC ) , such as the Yin-Yang , Five elements and theories of the Zang Fu ( Organs ) . It is also likely that more was added to this classic by later dynasties . <p> The book describes the conversations between the Yellow Emperor ( Huang Ti ) and his physician ( Chi Po ) , hence it is a historical ( actually legendary ) account . <p> Huang Ti is said to have lived 2697-2595 BC , i.e. before writing existed . He was portrayed as a true Renaissance man . He designed a cart based on the big dipper , designed a series of musical notes and instruments to play them on , but his great love was medicine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his physician , during which he asks about everything imaginable . <p> There are 2 parts to the Nei Jing : <p> Su Wen ( Essential Questions ) : This forms the core of the book ; it deals with the whole realm of medical knowledge , and involves aspects of all the philosophical concepts mentioned earlier . <p> Ling Shu ( Spiritual Axis ) : This mainly constitutes a supplement to the Su Wen . It expounds the concept of Tao and the cosmological patterns of the universe , then portrays with vivid imagery the character of the two primordial forces , Yin and Yang , and how they interact in nature and in human beings . There is then a description of the bodily organs ( as " officials " - showing Confucian influences ) , and their functions and pathologies . The technique of pulse reading for diagnosis and the various types of pulses are discussed at length . <p> The book describes how to live in harmony with nature , and the results of not doing so ( imbalance and disharmony ) . Therapies are based @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Surgery is mentioned , but only as a last resort e.g. to remove tumors . <p> Acupuncture is mainly mentioned in the Ling Shu . Commentaries were added , both in the 3rd century BC and in later dynasties . <p> One commentary published in the same period was the NAN JING ( Difficult Classic ) appeared . This filled out the Nei Jing and answered some difficult questions . Points for acupuncture and moxibustion are discussed , as well as physiological and pathological conditions of the eight Extra Vessels . Many commentaries were added in the Tang dynasty . These are important , and render the work easier to read , the essential part was left intact .

If you must use a metal container , use stainless steel . <h> Water <p> Room temperature spring water or purified water are the best choices for cooking herbs . <h> Cooking the Herbs <p> The water should cover the herbs by about 2 inches and they should be soaked for at least an hour before turning the heat on .

So Blood deficiency pattern can progress into Yin deficiency . Appropriate herbs include American Ginseng ( Xi yang shen ) which can tonify body fluids as well . <h> Precautions for the Tonifying Method : <p> Do not tonify when there is an exterior disease present . The idea is that if you tonify ( the interior ) while there is an exterior Evil , you run the risk of leading the Evil into the interior . <p> Do not tonify when there is an excess Heat pattern present . Tonifying when there is a fever will likely worsen the fever . Like adding fuel to a fire . <p> Do not tonify if there is an excess type pain . Again if you tonify when there is pain due to Qi stagnation it will increase the pain ( like increasing the pressure without unblocking the obstruction ) . <p> There are cases where the patient may be so deficient , that they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spleen is so weak that the digestive tract is unable to handle the stronger herbs .

So it is important to monitor the treatment as well as to avoid abuse of tonification . <p> Comparison with Western Medicine ( When to use Tonification ) : <p> Hormonal Problems Appropriate for conditions such as deficient adrenal glands ( Addison 's diseases ) where the Kidney is Yang Deficient . Hypothyroidism is similar to Yang deficiency . Hyperthyroidism is similar to Yin deficiency . <p> Asthma For asthma due to deficient Kidney and Lung it may be appropriate to tonify these organs . <p> Bone Diseases Including arthritis , broken bones , osteoporosis ( the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Immune System Problems Tonify the Lungs Qi to benefit the Immune system .

Tonify the Zheng Qi , but must also Break Stagnation and Dissolve Phlegm . <p> Anemia May also be difficult to treat as it may be due to lack of marrow function ; if so then tonify the Kidney and Spleen to treat this condition . Overall the Tonification method is used frequently in the clinic , especially for people with chronic illnesses . <h> 8 . Remove Congestion Method <p> Use to Treat Food Stagnation . Can be due to poor digestion or overeating causing bloating , nausea , vomiting , diarrhea . Food Stagnation herbs are used specifically for these conditions . <p> Use to Treat Phlegm Congestion This is not the same as the Western notion of phlegm . It includes but is not limited to the sputum we expectorate . Nodules , fatty tumors , swollen glands are consider phlegm under the skin.Acupuncture : Turtle needling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patient may feel very tired and heavy . Dampness can also be complicated by Heat . And if it persists long enough can turn into phlegm . <p> Examples : Lower Jiao Damp Heat can look like a urinary tract infection ( UTI ) . For this condition you need to promote water ( circulation and elimination ) and remove dampness . Upper Jiao Dampness can manifest as Meniere 's disease where there is vertigo , dizziness due to Damp congestion . Again this is treated by promoting water movement and draining Dampness . <h> Precautions for the Remove Congestion Method : <p> Removing Congestion and Purging are methods used to treat Excess conditions . If the onset of the condition is acute , use the Purging method not the Remove Congestion method . Remove Congestion is not as strong but nor is it as harsh as Purging . <p> Used to Stop Hemorrhage ( Astringe the Blood ) . Used for chronic bleeding conditions such as hemophilia <h> Precautions for the Astringing Method : <p> Do NOT use for acute Excess condition . This both will lock in any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ condition ( such as heat , wind , etc .. ) . Generally you would combine this treatment method with the Tonifying treatment method . The tonification treats the root of problem while Stringing treats the symptoms . <p> Used to Regulate the Qi and Vitalize the Blood . Qi is the leader of the Blood , so some kinds of Blood Stagnation are caused by Qi stagnation and congestion . For example Liver Qi Stagnation produces PMS symptoms ( painful menstruation ) . This method is good for many female problems . <p> Used to Warm the Channels and Vitalize the Blood . Blood stagnation can be caused by Cold Evil . One of the obvious symptoms of blood stagnation is sharp pain , pain that is somewhat alleviated by warmth . For this condition , can use moxa and acupuncture to treat as well . <p> Used for certain kinds of Wind Problems which cause Blood Stagnation . Generally Internal Wind is caused by Excess Heat . However , Blood stagnation can also cause Internal Wind . For example a stroke due to Blood stagnation can cause Wind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Used to stop Bleeding due to Blood Stagnation . Blood stagnation can cause Bleeding . In such cases , the Stop Bleed method does not work because of the stagnation . For example , tissue left behind an abortion , or after delivery can cause uterine bleeding . <p> Used in Cancer conditions . Blood stagnation is considered one of the Evils that contribute to cancer . Cancers that have blood stagnation qualities ( purple coloration , fixed stabbing pain , mass/tumor ) can be addressed using the treatment method . <h> Precautions for the Invigorating Blood Method : <p> Do NOT use this method during the patient 's period . This will cause excessive bleeding . <p> Do not use this during pregnancy . As you may cause bleeding and a miscarriage . <p> Do not use this method for long periods . Otherwise you may break down the blood , affecting the Qi , resulting in deficiency patterns . <h> 11 . Regulating the Qi Method <p> Used for Qi Stagnation Use herbs and acupuncture to move the Qi to break up the stagnation . In this pattern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Can be used for Lung or Stomach Qi rising up . In both cases the Qi normally descends . When the Qi rebels , it ascends producing symptoms . In the Lungs you have coughing , and in the Stomach you have belching or vomiting . Use herbs and acupuncture points that direct the Qi downwards . <h> Precautions for the Regulating the Qi Method : <p> Regulating method may spread the Qi to much weakening the Qi . Consider adding Qi tonifying method , or making sure that the patient is not too Qi deficient . <p> Contraindicated when patient is Yin/Blood deficient . Herbs that regulate the Qi are spicy and dry . This method will dry out the body aggravating the Yin/Blood deficiency .

@@4519698 <h> Bladder Pattern Differentiation in Chinese Medicine <h> Etiology of Bladder Patterns <p> The Bladder 's main function of transforming and excreting fluids relies on Kidney Yang . Bladder patterns can result not only from Kidney Yang Deficiency , but from accumulation of Dampness as well . Dampness can accumulate in the Bladder as a result of exposure to damp climates , For example ; Living , working , or even sitting in damp places . The Bladder also belongs to the Water element and is affected by the emotion of Fear ( especially in children ) , which can deplete Bladder Qi and cause nocturnal enuresis . <h> Damp Heat in the Bladder <h> Signs : <p> Frequent or urgent urination and pain or burning during urination - Due to Heat in Bladder <p> Difficult urination , dark yellow , or cloudy urination - Due to Dampness obstructing the flow of fluids in the Lower Jiao <p> Gravel or Stones in the urine - Due to Dampness congealing <p> Fever and Thirst - Due to Excess Heat <p> Tongue : Red with a sticky yellow coating - Due to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the proximal position - Due to Dampness and Heat <h> Etiology : <p> This is an Interior Excess Heat pattern . It can arise from exposure to exterior Dampness which can penetrate the Bladder from below . Alternatively it can be caused when Dampness builds up in the Lower Burner ( as a result of Kidney and/or Spleen Yang deficiency ) , which then combines with interior Heat . The Heat can arise after long-standing stagnation of Dampness itself , or from another interior Heat condition . <h> Treatment Principle : <p> Clear heat , resolve Damp , and open the water passages in the Lower Jiao <h> Etiology/Pathology : <p> Arises from Kidney Yang Deficiency . Kidney Yang is insufficient to give the Bladder enough Qi to control fluids , and the fluids therefore ' leak out ' . Kidney Yang Deficiency can be caused by excessive sexual activity , or excessive exposure to Damp or Cold climates.

The journey of absorbing and comprehending Chinese Medicine generally requires simultaneous cross-referencing of multiple textbooks to get the details needed to deepen ones understanding of the art 's inter-relationships . Sacred Lotus Arts enables students and practitioners to navigate and access these complex inter-relationships with unprecedented ease and clarity . <p> Sacred Lotus Arts integrates TCMs teachings by letting computers handle the relationships . This means that for the first time , volumes of information can be searched , compared , and combined in a way that helps to organize , rearrange , and quickly answer complex related questions . <p> For example , consider the following three questions : , " Which aromatic Chinese herbs enter the Lung channel ? What categories are those herbs in ? Which formulas contain those herbs ? " One can arrive at the answer to these questions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time it takes to look up the relevant information in the appropriate books . It goes ( almost ) without saying that one must know the appropriate and wise questions to ask in order to arrive at answers that have real value . <p> The study of Chinese Medicine can be an overwhelming and intense experience . This is in part due to the extensive volume of information and the relative brevity of most college programs . On top of this , licensing exams encourage memorization of vast amounts of information , which is not necessarily supportive of long term retention or integration of the content . <p> There are tools that can guide us through the more complex landscapes of Chinese Medicine . If you understand how TCM is organized , present the material to yourself in as many ways as possible , and cultivate a genuine command of theory and foundations , you are well on your way to a richer relationship with TCM and its subject matter .

@@4520145 <h> Review : Chinese Herbal Patent Medicines : The Clinical Desk Reference <h> Review : Chinese Herbal Patent Medicines : The Clinical Desk Reference <p> Reviewed by Sacred Lotus on : 03/04/2013 <p> There are thousands of Chinese herbal patent medicines from different manufacturers available in the United States . While Fratkin 's clinical desk reference is an older book ( 2001 ) , it is still my personal favorite for referencing any of the bottled/packaged Chinese medicines . There has only been a handful of times that I have not been able to reference an off-the-shelf Chinese patent medicine ( i.e. - an obscure Chinese patent bottle brought in by a patient ) . <p> The book covers over 1,300 products , with 109 chapters , and has color photos for most of the patent medicines in the book . The table of contents is broken down nicely into 12 categories of TCM disorders . There is author 's commentary on each section , where he introduces the TCM theory behind the patterns and medicines . There is also an extensive appendix of symptoms and diseases , enabling you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within each disorder category . <p> The Chinese patent formulas can be looked up by either English or Pinyin indices . If you still ca n't find the medicine , you can browse through almost 1,000 photos of the product bottles/packages . The book also has appendices to look up the herbs by Chinese characters , pharmaceutical , botanical , and common names . <p> Each medicine includes : <p> Actions/Indications <p> Origin of the Formula <p> Author 's Comments/Notes <p> Cautions ( if any ) <p> Research ( if any ) <p> Laboratory Analysis and Purity ( if any ) <p> Legality/Endangered Species ( if any ) <p> Ingredients ( if known ) <p> Packaging and Dosage <p> One of my favorite aspects of the ' Clinical Desk Reference ' is that includes relevant clinical research on the medicines . For instance , ' Xiao Yao Wan ' ( Free and Relaxed Pills ) contains the results of a study on 253 acute hepatitis patients taking the patent , with a general effective rate of 69% . <p> Another important aspect of the book is that California FDB ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 500 products in the book . And , if available , each patent medicine contains information on whether the sample contained heavy metals and/or pharmaceuticals . Certain patents for example had toxic levels of arsenic , mercury , lead , etc . Other medicines contained western drugs , chemical preservatives , dyes , etc . <p> In closing , I would like to note that there are plenty of very safe and effective Chinese herbal patent formulas available today . This book ( and others ) undoubtedly inspired stricter manufacturing processes , tighter control , better regulation , and awareness and advocacy about the contents of imported Chinese medicines .
