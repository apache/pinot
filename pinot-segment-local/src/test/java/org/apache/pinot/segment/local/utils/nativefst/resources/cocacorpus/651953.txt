@@109708750 @5108750/ <p> It 's 1913 in England , and an ordinary schoolteacher called John Smith dreams of adventures in time and space and a mysterious blue box , as Russell T Davies 's Doctor Who continues . But , when lights in the sky herald the arrival of something strange and terrible , Smith 's maid , Martha , has to convince him that he alone can save the world . <p> Submitted : <p> 19/6/2007 <p> Reviewer : <p> Shawn Lunn <p> Martha : " This is not you , this is 1913 " The Doctor : " This is 1913 " . <p> This episode really does n't  need any introduction because already even casual viewers will be well aware of not only where the source material of the start of this thrilling two parter came from but also that its being penned by the same author . When there 's a good idea out there , you grab and this one is more than good , its amazing . <p> The Doctor and Martha are on the run from creatures we know nothing about but they must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inside the TARDIS . Already the threat of doom has been placed and The Doctor not only questions Marthas trust of him but comes up with an unconventional way of evading his pursuers . <p> Then bam , we wake up 94 years earlier and its not The Doctor who is getting up out of the bed because while the man we see may look like the overenthusiastic Tenth Timelord , this man goes by the name of John Smith and the only escapades he has had in time are clearly in his head and in reality as his maid Martha Jones is told . <p> If you 're one of the people who have n't read or heard of writer Paul Cornells " Human Nature " book , then you might make the mistake of The Doctor hitting an Its A Wonderful Life type of reality but soon enough you learn that our Timelord is now human and has another important vocation education . <p> Yeah , Mr John Smith is a teacher at Farringham School For Boys where he teaches them history and attempts to motivate their lazy hides into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he s a happy little human , he still ca n't really shake his dreams out of his head . <p> Telling the well versed Martha about them is one as her reasons for believing in them much more is nicely explained halfway through the episode but he also feels compelled to discuss them with Matron Joan Redfern , who it does n't  take much of a genius to spot that she has an interest in John Smith that well extends professional boundaries . <p> In Cornells book , Joan was a Science teacher but ultimately a change in profession does little to hinder her impact as the casting of Spaced actress Jessica Hynes is yet another spot choice . I could go on and on about how wonderfully she works with David Tennant and I will because I guarantee , it is not hard to see why John Smith takes more than a shine to her as well . <p> There 's some wonderfully bumbling moments between the pair that could come out of any standard romantic comedy as Joan makes a ham fisted attempt to invite John to a local @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fall down the stairs but even a hardcore cynic will find these particular moments quite funny . <p> However Joans affection for John does n't  help Martha as we soon learn that while The Doctor might be running around thinking he s human , Martha knows exactly what he is as she later heads to the TARDIS and watches a recording of things to do while her and The Doctor hide out in 1913 . <p> I have to admit as pseudonyms go , using John Smith has got to be the most painfully obvious of choices and if the enemies that are pursuing The Doctor have in depth knowledge of him , then surely theyd be ploughing through the Smiths or Johns of this particular era but changing a name is only one thing in the art of hiding . <p> The Doctor has always been someone who does n't  do things by halves so not does he use his much famous alias , he uses a device inside the TARDIS called a Chameleon Arch to rewrite his entire DNA making him a physical human being and due to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decision to become mortal is explained effectively and I have to admit I 'm glad that he also admitted to Martha that they are times he wanted to do it even when he was n't being pursued . <p> Being a respected teacher with a lovely matron must be every man on the run dream but it poses no surprise that Martha would get the rotten end of the deal . Taking away the fact she could be stuck in another time era for an indefinite period and can possible never see her family , The Doctor left her up the creek without a paddle in other ways too . <p> Let 's think about it , Martha may know who John Smith really is but his source of remembering himself via a watch is in his possession and he s quick to not notice it being snatched by one of his students and also due to the time period , the much educated Martha is reduced to a maid who is dismissed by John and Joan at different points and also has to put up with racial taunts from some of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did complain about Marthas skin colour not posing an issue in " The Shakespeare Code " certainly got the issue posed there . Martha took the snide remark about her skin in her stride but I got the feeling she did that more because she did n't  want to blow her cover and be separated from John because she certainly did not feel inferior to some of the war hungry students . <p> That 's the funny thing about Martha as while this episode is a dramatic free for all and while you definitely pity her for having to bear the brunt of John Smiths new life including the way people disregard her , there are moments where her jealousy over Joan really annoyed me . <p> I know it might be silly if Marthas crush on The Doctor just instantly disappeared but having her constant disapproval of Joan or lament to fellow maid Jenny that John and Joan wont last makes you want to shake some sense into her . Martha you 're supposed to be undercover which means drawing attention to yourself and telling Jenny you and John are leaving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the sky , well let 's just there significant ways of drawing attention to yourself . <p> Still though whoever is pursing The Doctor must be damn powerful for the human option and also damn effective and with the likes of Martha and Joan spotting green lights at night , its only when snide Jeremy Baines sneaks out for some late night beer do we get a clue about what 's going on . <p> The Doctor is being pursued by something called The Family which seems to have the ability to possess and soon enough Jeremy is the first person whose body they seize in order to scope out The Doctor and for Robin Hood actor Harry Lloyd he gets to change physically as a the possessed schoolboy . <p> That 's another thing as well the school is which John Smith is teaching seems to be preparing the boys for war and with the exception of Timothy Latimer , these boys are more than eager to get their hands dirty in other peoples blood and even Smith does n't  seem to have an objective to war . <p> Its one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ points out that subconsciously perhaps Smith wants to be The Doctor and he certainly proves he has Timelord inside him when his quick wittedness saves a baby from a piano . Okay among the high drama and creepiness that moment felt a bit cartoonish . <p> Its also the very touching moments in which John asks Joan out to the dance and when they both discuss their families too . Its amazing with writing and performances this sublime that John and Joan become ship worthy . We know they 're doomed every bit as much as Martha does but I still ca n't help but like them and that kiss between them was very sweet . <p> Getting back to The Family , while Baines may be getting suspicious of John Smith , one person who knows that things are far from right is Timothy Latimer . He s the scrawny kid that gets picked on by all the other boys and its his abilities at guessing so correctly draw conflict with the boys he bunks with but it also helps forward the plot as well . <p> Its him who sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be and its him who takes the watch that wouldve been better in Marthas possession and by opening draws The Family closer and closer into finding The Doctor and its also him who realises that Martha is n't from this time either . <p> All in all , he s a smart kid who could potentially be used to take The Family along with The Doctor and Martha provided he s not killed or possessed by next weeks instalment . Those of you who wanted continuity on the " you are not alone " message get it here . <p> With Timothy being on our side in the background and Martha being regarded as a fantasist by both John and Joan , The Family moved faster in getting more for their army and soon enough we have sinister scarecrows called Jack Straws that abduct Clark , a random little girl with a red balloon and Jenny and soon enough all three of them fall in line with the mother of mime . <p> That 's the other with The Family , just who the hell are they and why do they want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? I 'd like to think they are somehow connected for this series purpose connected to Mr Saxon but its more probable that they have their own agenda rather than facilitating someone elses . <p> They are definitely a determined bunch as the actors , especially Harry Lloyd amp the creepy factor in their possessed state and the Jack Straws are one of the most stunning creations we 've had . Its fantastic how threatening a bunch of scarecrows are made on a Saturday tea time series but at the same time , this season has continued to impress anyway . <p> However things then come to a head during the local dance when possessed people and Jack Straws invade to take The Doctor and because John does n't  remember a sodding thing , the threats of harming Martha and Joan does little to help him to jog his memory . If ever there was a danger fuelled cliff hanger , this would be it . <p> Also in " Human Nature " ... <p> The opening sequence is part present day , part 1913 . Its a strange sequence because not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ verified until halfway through the episode . <p> The Doctor : " Martha you trust me , do n't  you ? " Martha : " Of course I do " The Doctor : " Because it all depends on you " . <p> I 've noticed with this series when The Doctor and companion go undercover , the latter gets a menial job . Rose had to be a dinner lady in " School Reunion " in which The Doctor was a teacher . <p> The things in Johns diaries include images of Daleks , Cybermen , Slitheen , Clockwork Droids , Rose , Rienette , the TARDIS and previously incarnations of The Doctor . We never wouldve gotten that in the first series . <p> John Smith : " I dream quite often that I have two hearts " Joan : " Well I 'll be the judge of that " . <p> In the books , The Family were called the Aubertides but according to Cornell their motivations are the same . The Family sounds a bit better to me . <p> Latimer : " I 'm good at guessing that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Who are you , why cant I see you ? " The Family : " Why would you want to ? " <p> Latimer saw images from the monsters in the first two seasons when he opened up the watch . I delighted in the act he heard " burn with me " more than " last of the time lords " or " you are not alone " . <p> We learned that Joan had a deceased war hero husband . I bet everyone spotted the name of Johns parents being the names of people significant with the old series . This episode has the biggest nods to the old series bar none . <p> Martha ( regarding The Doctor ) : " You had to fall in love with a human and its not me " . <p> David Tennant is credited both as The Doctor and Smith in this episode while the preview for next weeks was at the end . <p> Joan : " You best warn me in advance , can you actually dance ? " John : " I 'm not certain " . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ involved The Doctor not being allowed to hurt anyone , not to worry about the TARDIS , no involvement with historical events and to not abandon Martha which kinda got broke . <p> Chronology : November 13th 1913 but The Doctor took Martha along in 2007 , which contradicts previous chronology on the series . <p> This was the most breathtaking piece of television Ive ever seen and I have seen plenty that could rival it . " Human Nature " is definitely a more sophisticated , adult look at Doctor Who and Paul Cornells much revered novel will now be a much revered set of episodes in this shows history . Its one of those magical things where works the characters , performances , the writing , the history of the Timelord , the essential creepiness and imminent disaster and Murray Golds superb scoring . Its possibly the best episode of the series yet and definitely the most ambitious . <p> I expected Human Nature to be something different and was certainly unlike any other Doctor Who story . <p> Each episode of the Dalek two-parter earlier this season @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Natures more pedestrian plot made it feel very dependent on its conclusion before being able to give it a thorough analysis . That 's not a criticism at all . the more gentle nature of this story allowed for some fantastic characterisation from the regular and guest cast . <p> The dramatic beginning left no room for the viewer to take a breath , as the Doctor and Martha were pursued into the TARDIS by the mysterious Family , who have a relentless nose for hunting their prey . The Doctor used the never-seen-before chameleon arch to entirely re-write his bodys DNA and memories so that he became a fully-fledged human , complete with memories that inserted him seamlessly into 1913 England as teacher John Smith . Martha serves as his watchful maid while they hide from the Family , who inevitably find the fugitives . <p> The episode certainly lacks the pace and drama of other episodes this year , but watching our familiar Doctor portraying the unfamiliar John Smith is compelling . We all know David Tennant is a great actor , and his new performance is the jewel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Doctor , but with a moral wholesomeness that we know he shares with the Doctor . <p> Fans may get their knickers in a twist that Smith falls in love with and snogs Joan Redfern , but I do n't  know why . Watching the Doctor ( as Smith ) fumble through lifes dramas such as falling in love is just refreshing The previous week , in 42 , we saw the Doctor who was really scared . This week we see something entirely differentSurely after 44 years of Time Lord adventures , any opportunity to do something different should be welcomed ? I for one liked seeing him in a totally different role . <p> The setting of the boys school and small village in 1913 was very evocative , featuring some stunning location work . Its a setting in which John Smith seemed perfectly comfortable . <p> The same can not be said for Martha Jones . This episode also provided a lot of scope for Freema Agyeman . The 1913 setting must be as alien to contemporary Martha as another planet would be . It would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ racial attitudes were less enlightened than they are now ( not to say 2007 is perfect ! ) . <p> Martha seemed disempowered when forced into the maids role and is constantly reminded to mind her place . Martha suffers the attitudes of school students and staff with quiet indignation and a touch of sarcasm ( love the scene when Matron tells her she should knock before entering , so she goes back to the door and knocks with a very sarcastic look on her face ) . The only thing with this scenario is that Martha was left not being able to do too much . Her moping in the TARDIS is both touching and frustrating for us as much as her . <p> The other character of note is Matron Joan Redfern , John Smiths love interested . Perhaps what makes her so appealing is that she seems a little out of her time . She certainly seems quite forward for an early 20th Century lady , and maybe that 's what 's appealing to John Smith . <p> Smiths attraction to Joan has a visible impact on Martha . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you had to go and fall in love with a human and it was not me " was extremely poignant and finally affirms what we all knew Martha fancies her travelling companion big time . <p> The rest of the episode is littered with lovely characters the thoroughly dislikeable Hutchison , homely Jenny and curious young student Timothy Latimer . Latimers psychic abilities seemed to jar as there appeared to be no explanation for his unusual abilities , but perhaps that will come next week . <p> Creepiest of all is student Jeremy Baines . Like Hutchison , he was unpleasant to start with , but becomes thoroughly creepy when possessed by the Family . Who would have thought taking a big sniff could be so unsettling ? <p> That brings me to the Family of Blood Their invisible ship was nicely realised and I like the concept that they have no permanent form but take whatever form they need . They want a Time Lord but what for ? It was annoying not to know the back story as to why they were chasing the Doctor and Martha in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become clearer next week . <p> The Familys scarecrow army does not quite work for me . They look fantastic and creepy , granted , but they failed to ever seem that scary . Perhaps its their slow lumbering walk , or the fact that most of their scenes are so brightly lit , which bleached away any menace . <p> One of the biggest gripes I have with the story is the watch . The Doctor stressed that all he is his Time Lordiness and memories - will be stored in the watch . It must not be opened at any cost , and it must be kept safe . Then why would John Smith have been left in possession of the watch ? Smith was unaware of its nature , so would n't he open it to see the time ? Even if he was not using it , why would it be left casually around for young school pupils to steal ? Surely Martha , who knows its real value , would keep it safe . Of course , as soon as it was stolen , Martha needed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Speaking of contrived , the scene where Smith uses a cricket ball to save a mother and baby from being squashed by a piano is also very contrived . But a lot of fun and a nice homage to the 5th Doctor . <p> Homages to the past were another nice link in this episode . The Doctor may have gone but his Diary of Impossible Things contained some lovely drawings that not only beautifully recapped the previous two seasons but linked it to the classic series lovely touch . <p> Overall , Human Nature is a gentler episode than other recent outings . A nice pause after the manic rush of 42 . It was new territory for Doctor Who that proved the formula for the show is as limitless as the imagination . Ill look forward to The Family of Blood , but also look forward to having the Doctor back as well !

They demand that the Doctor identify himself , shocking him ; he tells them who he is , only to be met with confusion . The Daleks all then starts asking " Doctor Who ?

@@109708793 @5108793/ <p> The finale of The Daleks is the first time in Doctor Who where we see a romantic kiss between a member of the TARDIS crew and another character . The relationship between Barbara and Ganatus was so sweet and built so nicely that I was rooting for her to stay on Skaro by the end of it . Of course she does not and Ganatus is left to soldier on alone . It 's in Ganatus ' nature to persevere though , so I thought he might just try and find a way to connect with Barbara again . Love knows no bounds , right ? <p> It had been a week since the funeral ceremony for Temmosus , Elyson , and Antodus . The band of Thals made their way towards the Dalek City , their hearts still heavy from recent events , but also filled with hope for what technology they might find within the now empty city . <p> " Nearly there ! " Alydon called back at the rest of the group . A murmur of excitement went through them and Dyoni hurried to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she back at him . After Ian Chestertons threats to offer her up to the Daleks , their relationship had been solidified . <p> " I 'm worried for Ganatus . " Dyoni said . <p> " He has lost much . His wounds will take more time to heal than ours . " Alydon said , wrapping his arm around Dyoni to comfort her . When he looked over his shoulder back at Ganatus , he wondered if time would ever heal his friend . <p> Ganatus knew he should feel more upset for his brothers death , but all he could think of was Barbara . If only he could find a way to reach her . It seemed impossible , as her ship had simply vanished into thin air . He wondered if the Daleks would have research on the matter . <p> They arrived at the Dalek City and entered the main building . Alydon divided the band in halfone group would search for food , the other would sort through the Daleks research and inventions . Dyoni led the first group and Ganatus made his way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ main research labs were . <p> They found themselves in a large open room full of computer terminals , all equipped with round buttons , perfectly formed for a Daleks mechanical hand . Each Thal started going through the data . One made a joke how it would be easier if they had Dalek hands . Everyone laughed except Ganatus , who was absorbed in the data . He was n't just looking , he was searching . <p> There were several minutes of silence until Alydon cried out , " I 've got it ! " <p> They all gathered around to see . The plans for reforming radiation into heat energy were on the screen , however the heat would be used in laser form , to kill . <p> " We can harness the energy and instead of concentrating it , we can spread it throughout greenhouses to grow crops . " Alydon explained . Everyone was excited . Right away , Alydon began putting the concept into action . He sent two of the Thals to find the others and start a survey of the wastelands around the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ganatus , and the remaining Thal , Mylanos , would start to adapt the current blueprints into something that would work for the greenhouses . Ganatus volunteered to go in search for the parts they would need and left the room . <p> With no sound but the clanking of his footsteps on the metal flooring , Ganatus suddenly felt very alone . Were Barbara here , he thought , she would have no fear . His thoughts of her were interrupted when , out of the corner of his eye , Ganatus saw something move . He looked over , scanning the area intensely , but saw nothing except a small white door . His curiosity now piqued , Ganatus made his way to the door and pushed it open easily even though there was clearly a lock on it . He wondered how this was possible , since all locks in the city would only open at a Daleks touch . It was as if He quickly forgot that thought as soon as he saw what was inside the room . It was Barbaras spaceship , or at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not a blue wood . Ganatus scanned the room and saw a lever in the corner . He tried it , but it was magnetic and would n't budge . He looked around the room again for another magnet or a large piece of metal . There was nothing but the ship and bare , white walls . Suddenly he heard a metallic clanking and turned to see the lever moving . Impossible , he thought . He was about to ask who was there when the door to the ship opened . A bright , golden light emanated from it , pulling him towards it . He could n't look away ; he could n't even blink . The time energy flowed into him and he felt himself moving , but in a way he had never experienced . The room rushed around him in a golden and white swirl of light and he felt the floor give out below him . Then all went black . <p> When Ganatus came to , he was no longer on Skaro . Tapestries of reds , yellows , and greens filled the gilded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swords and the yells from the crowd filled the great hall . " Tegana ! " " Marco ! " they called . <p> Then he heard her voice clear as day . He turned around and there she was , holding Susan and another dark-haired girl . " Barbara ! " he called to her . She did n't  respond . Ian Chesterton and the Doctor stood by them . He called out to them in vain . They can not hear or see me , he surmised , the Daleks must have only developed a one-way portal . The emperor , who he heard called Kublai Khan , summoned guards to stop the fight . Yelling ensued among the men , and then a cry from all . The dark-haired sword fighter called Tegana had killed himself . Ganatus ran to Barbara to comfort her as she looked away from the scene , but there was nothing he could do but watch Ian hold onto her . Marco gave the Doctor something and the four travelers ran to the TARDIS . As Ganatus watched the familiar disappearance he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The room spun again and Ganatus awoke to find himself back on Skaro . He scrambled to his feet . <p> " Dalek !

" I do n't  understand . How can you be alive still ? " " They took me from my casing , but forgot of my existence . So , I hid and waited . And now with the time energy from you I will make my escape through a temporal shift to save my kind . I will take the name of that great leader , Caan , and lead the new Dalek race . " the Dalek said , adopting the Dal spelling of Khan . " But you are all dead ! " Ganatus cried . " I have seen the future . A great war is coming , the war of time , and I shall save the Creator of my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Ganatus ran towards the electrical box by the door , but he was too slow and Dalek Caans laser hit him , killing Ganatus instantly .

@@109708794 @5108794/ <p> Paradise Towers is n't known for being one of the best Doctor Who stories made over the last fifty years , and I do n't  doubt that the majority of fans would willingly surrender it to the great Borusa in the sky in return for the missing episodes of even The Space Pirates ( or another suitably naff story of the time ) . And I 'm not going to try and defend it to you , because I agree that it really is pretty poor . However , there was a lot of potential in the story , and some solid ideas were probably buried somewhere beneath the Kangs and the cannibalistic " Rezzie " dents . <p> The glimpse we get of the very 80s promotional video for the titular Towers and the backstory seeded through the final part all begin to add a bit of depth to the story , and perhaps once this " Great " Architect ( come on , its hardly the Gherkin ) was n't just a big wobbly brain in the basement . Let 's find out . <p> " Kroagnon leant over his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against his grey - once-silver - flaking skin as he scanned briefly a large blueprint plan of a tall , square tower . His nose arched itself up as he spotted a digi-fax ping itself onto his computer screen , set three inches into the desk . Flicking his green screen-readers on with an irritated spasm of the wrist , he pressed a yellow button to the side of the screen . The digi-fax opened up with the graphic of a letter being retrieved from an envelope and he began to read the enclosed text aloud . <p> " Kroagnon , " a dark , commanding voice slipped the word from within the frail man , " We are writing again to warn you that should you refuse to surre- " <p> The Great Architect cut off with a snort . " If those fools think they 're going to overrun my towers with youngsters and oldsters , they 're going to be seriously disappointed ! " he growled , a matchingly angry expression snarling into life upon his old face . <p> He covered over the computer screen with a sliding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Suddenly , he spotted what he was looking for : a blueprint of a machines internal workings . He studied an electronic motherboard diagram , tracing paths with his finger . He scowled and dropped the paper , pulling off his screen-glasses . On another piece of paper was an engineering drawing of some kind of robot . It was angular and imposing , with various appendages attached to two mechanical arms . <p> At that moment , a door opposite Kroagnon slid open and one of the contraptions slid in gracefully , as if moving on a bed of air . The only traitor to its entrance was the excessively loud whining of its underpowered motors , dragging the vehicle along slowly . Kroagnon looked up and something approaching a smile cracked his face . <p> " Ah hello . " he purred at the machine , showing affection for the recycled vacuum cleaner . <p> It continued to advance towards him , and suddenly a great hydraulic arm hissed from the centre of the unit to display a cuff which was promptly clamped around Kroagnons neck . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he cried , his face - for some reason - turning a vivid shade of orange . " I created you ! " <p> " Yes , thank you for that Architect 459/7 article 4 subsection 8 , " grinned a soft yet gruesome voice , " They will be most useful . " <p> A man with a curt moustache and beady , piercing eyes was now standing authoritatively in the doorway . This new arrival was wearing a grey hat , with black trim , and a neat uniform to match . He was flanked by two men dressed in similar attire . The grip on Kroagnons neck loosened slightly at the nod of the head from the new figure . <p> " But who are you ? " he spluttered weakly . <p> " I am the Chief Caretaker , " came the confident and swift reply . " Paradise Towers is now in my charge on the order of the government , to be used as a safehouse for the young and old of our society - although I was informed you had been contacted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off me ! " The Great Architect was now more likely to be known as The Defeated Wreck . " I have worked myself to death to create this building , using only the help of one robot ! " <p> With a final last effort , Kroagnon stabbed at a green button under his desk . It glowed for a moment , and then went off . Across the Towers , various booby traps and tools were activated . Caretaker 345/12 subsection 2 accompanied Kroagnon and the robot as they left the room . Once they were gone , the Chief picked up the design for the mechanical monstrosity and studied it . A seal of approval grinning in his eyes , he handed it to the remaining Caretaker . <p> " Get these into mass production at once , " he ordered . <p> " Yes chief , " the subservient Caretaker uttered , taking the paper , " but what are they ?

Beyond it was a cavern of a room , with a central pit in which a brain sat , lifeless . It was easily the size of a family hoverbout . Caretaker 345/12 subsection 2 stopped aghast for a moment , taking in the sight before him . He scrambled for his radio , but suddenly Kroagnon had him in a surprisingly powerful grip . <p> " You are going to help me. " came the quiet but confident whisper of the Great Architect . His eyes seemed to glow a gentle pink , sucking in the mind of the Caretaker . <p> " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reply of his victim . <p> " This robot is going to release me , and then you are going to ensure that I stay in control of Paradise Towers forever .

" <p> The robot - a Cleaner - obeyed . Kroagnon fell to the ground , at the edge of the great mind . <p> " Hook me up to the machine , " the Architect lay still , his chest barely moving now . His bidding was done and a long thin probe was inserted into each ear . The brain seemed to jump into life , and two electronic eyes formed from fluorescent tubes flickered into life briefly , displaying the same pink pupils as Kroagnon . The Caretaker watched until the Great Architects body was finally lifeless and then turned to the brain . <p> " Feed me the body ! " commanded the brain , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Next , dope the Caretakers ! They must not know of me ! " <p> The Caretaker stepped forward and retrieved a vial from the dead Kroagnons top pocket . He pocketed it himself and then heaved the body over to a chute . The corpse slid into it comfortably and the brain seemed to rumble with satisfaction . The Caretaker walked monotonously out of the hideout , making for Kroagnons former office . Once he had left , the brain turned its attention to the robot . <p> " Follow him and once his orders are complete , bring him to me - dead ! I am hungry ! " <p> The machine slunk out , the clattering and spluttering still having their effect . The Mind of Kroagnon chuckled evilly . " Nothing can stop me now ! Paradise Towers is mine !

The voice of Horus tells the Doctor that the chamber has two switches and that he is allowed to ask one question of one Guardian of Horus . The Guardians materialise at the same moment as the Crucible and are mummy robots swathed in gold bindings . There is not much time as Sarah has a limited air supply within the chamber and will suffocate unless the Doctor can find out from them which is the right switch to activate .

Another Guardian of Horus appears and does battle with Sutekh 's robot . Sutekh realises that he is moments away from freedom and channels all of his power through Scarman in order to destroy the Eye of Horus . Scarman momentarily transforms into the jackal creature Sarah saw earlier in the TARDIS and destroys the Eye before falling to the floor and decaying to dust in an instant .

The Doctor explains that time control from the TARDIS shifted the mouth of the space-time tunnel into the far future , which Sutekh could never hope to reach . They had two minutes to return to Earth from Mars and set the trap because this is the amount of time that it takes for radio waves to propagate between the two planets . <p> As the Doctor and Sarah pack up and prepare to leave , a thermal imbalance in the time tunnel causes it to catch fire .

Kids think anyone over twenty 's old anyway , so what do I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the old with a jovial " Hello . I 'm the Doctor " ? Back of the net ! David who ... ? <p> But sometimes the Doctor needs someone to stop him . Talking to himself , that is . Which brings us to the new companion . <p> Amy 's a bit brittle . A bit highly-strung . A bit cynical . And who can blame her ? The Doctor ruined her life - that 's what she gets for talking to strangers ! No wonder she clouted him with a cricket bat . This is the most interesting Doctor/companion dynamic yet . I hope the new TARDIS has circuit breakers installed , cos there 's gon na be sparks . But where was Amy 's auntie during all this ? And no mum or dad ? REJOICE ! REJOICE ! REJOICE ! <p> The stunning Karen Gillan 's good if a little pouty - she kept reminding me of her spot-on Angelina Jolie on The Kevin Bishop Show . And I still ca n't look at her without thinking " Gritty BAFTA . " ( Wee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wo n't be seeing her again . Or will we ... ? ) <p> But it 's hard to believe she 's even less fleet of foot than Catherine Tate ( the other " Runaway Bride " ) was . Maybe it was that very short skirt that got the Daily Mail in such a tizzy . A kissogram ? " It was this or a French maid . " What was the keyword for this episode ? sexy ? Saucy ? Kinky ? <p> But fairy tales are n't all sweetness and light . What would a good fairy tale be without the stuff of nightmares ? ( Who said a Disney film ? ) And few images are as nightmarish as a giant frickin ' eye staring at you . But speaking of eyes , that flashy Doctorvision POV sequence was a bit Matrix-y ; a bit Sherlock Holmes ( the recent one ) . And it 'll get old real fast if it 's overused . Like bullet time did . <p> The vast new TARDIS is a bit busy . A bit lava lamp-y . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the silvery / black version on Confidential . You know , the dark one ( natch ) ? But , like the new feme choon , I 'm sure we 'll get used to it . And if we do n't like it we can always lump it . <p> I suppose the TARDIS should be a bit overwhelming the first time you see it . And a potentially Ecsher-like TARDIS interior could be interesting . But did n't the Moff ( who has said the Doctor should n't be " young and dashing " - whoops ! ) say something once about us kids wanting " Narnia not the wardrobe " ? Unless we 're treated to Die Hard in a TARDIS ! Yippee-kay-yay ... er , muddy funsters ? <p> There was no messing about here . BANG ! And we were off - hurtling across the London skyline . No reprise of the regeneration . No mention of Rose . Or the Time War . Or recent events even . Good . Time to move on . Doctor Who was getting a bit self-indulgent and fan-fictionish of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really did feel like series . <p> The first episode 's never the best but this was great - easily the best series opener yet . And if that blinding trailer was anything to go by , the rest of the season 's gon na be even better . Blimey ! <p> It 's Saturday , and it 's just about to begin . There 's a steaming mug of tea and numerous snacks next to me , the telephones are all switched off , the blinds are drawn and the Freeview box is recording . We 've reached the much-anticipated , long-awaited and **29;0;TOOLONG first episode of the 2010 series of Doctor Who . New Doctor , new assistant , new TARDIS inside and out , new show runner and mostly new crew . <p> I 'm not worried for the show itself ; it 's proven it can change and adapt and survive in today 's climate plenty of times since 2005 . I 'm worried about my view of it . I 'm like this every time there 's a new Doctor , but that 's not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ character , I 've emotionally invested a lot in my hero since I was knee high to a Zarbi , so it 's important to me they get him right . However , mixed with that I 'm also very aware it 's not " my " show any more , it 's for the kids that are growing up today ; the family audience . Not aging fanboys with robot dogs in their living rooms ... although they 're always the most vocal , I find . Some Doctor Who fans do nothing but whine as well , and that annoys me . Usually the ones who still think the show should be exactly how *they* want it , and something Russell T Davies took great delight in proving to be a false claim . <p> The pre-title sequence begins , and such thoughts are banished from my head . It 's straight into the action , more or less from where we last left off ; with the TARDIS hurtling towards London out of control and on fire . The main difference is The Doctor is hanging on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of the flapping doors . Talk about a different beginning : the TARDIS is wrecked , and the Doctor 's not going to get to collapse and sleep this one through . Poor bloke 's going to be knackered ! <p> The new titles kick in , and I simply stop breathing and stare . They 're *so* different . The vortex is reminiscent of the second Dalek film from the 1960s ; rather smokey , and there appears to be a lightning storm happening in there too . The theme tune is very different too , a marked departure from the Tennant era . Again , different is not bad . It just means I need to adjust and let it all sink in . The titles are very slick and clever , and then we 're back into the action . And I remember I 'm turning blue and start breathing again . <p> Amelia Pond is perfect . Just wonderful . The best child actor I 've seen in many a year ; she 's instantly likable and you 're just on her side from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Easter , and apologising if you 've woken him up , is genius from Mr Moffat . The TARDIS crash-lands , and The Doctor 's first line as he pops up from the new swimming pool/library combo he 's got going on in the ruined Police Box is perfect . " Can I have an apple ? " <p> After some perfect silliness with food - mmm , fish fingers and custard - and establishing that little Amelia is more than capable of holding her own already in life , there 's the first pang of darkness . The crack in the wall . With draughts and voices on the other side .. I think a few younger kids with cracks in their walls will suddenly be awake tonight , a little concerned about what may be behind it ... <p> One thing becomes obvious very quickly indeed . This is not what I was expecting . The direction , the locations and the mood and feel of Doctor Who have all changed . This is a very different show to Tennant 's Who - or more correctly to RTD @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing . I loved RTD 's era , and I loved Eccleston and Tennant , but this changes the whole ball game . It 's still recognisably the same format it 's always been , but somehow this seems bigger , better and more epic than I remember it being at any point before . I 'm blown away by this . It 's gotten better ... again ! And it was already stunning ! <p> The new Doctor is insanely likable . He 's mad , clever , funny when appropriate , and has me bonding with him in about fourteen seconds . Not once did I think about how David or Chris or Tom would have played a scene . The Doctor - Matt Smith 's Doctor - is in charge , and effortlessly so as well . However , grown up Amy 's more than a match for him though ; a clever new foil for his outbursts and ingenius insanity . She 's going to be an amazing companion , that girl , and Karen Gillan is effortlessly natural in the part . Spot on , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( fanboy squee : OMG ! There 's Sir Patrick Moore ! Brilliant ! ! ) and the scene with Jeff and The Doctor comandeering his laptop has me bellowing with laughter . <p> Prisoner Zero is another clever Moffat idea , a shapeshifter that uses comatose patients as a template ; although it 's a bit rubbish at getting the voices right . The silent dog and the barking man is hilarious ; but the girls and the Mother having the same voice in the hopsital stand-off sequence makes my blood run cold . That 's a definite chill . Taking the everyday and making it uncanny , unexpected and creepy . Gas masks . Ticking clocks . Stone Angels . We 're definitely in Moffat territory . The alien itself is no more pleasant . It reminds me of a deep sea angler fish , and it 's ugly . The Atraxi show up and they remind me of Axos and the Mandragora Helix set from Classic Doctor Who , and the Crystalline Enitity from Star Trek Next Gen. Not as in " nicked " , just an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reverent nod to the previous Doctors , and The Doctor 's current incarnation is now dressed properly and ready to save the world from being fried with some decent advice to the Atraxi , which he does with style , before legging it back to his now finished and revamped TARDIS . <p> We finally get a look inside , and aside from a raised eyebrow at some of the controls ( again , not negative , just unexpected ! ) I 'm over the moon at what they 've done to the best ship ever . The outside has those echoes of the 1960s series to it , and the inside just takes your breath away with the scale and love gone into it . <p> It 's all over in what seems like twenty minutes . It was actually an hour and five . The continuity announcers do that very , very annoying thing of talking over the credits and shrinking them to half the screen again , and it occurs to me that 's the only negative thing I can find . It also occurs to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I adjusted to that one really rather quickly . <p> I 'm relieved and ecstatic that the character I still care about is in a very , very safe set of hands . More than that , I think I 've fallen in love with The Doctor and his TARDIS all over again . Released from my hypnotic trance-like state that television 's held me in , I glance around . The snacks are untouched , and the tea 's now stone cold but undisturbed in the mug . And I remember that it was ever thus . When The Doctor 's in town , everything here stops .

@@109708819 @5108819/ <p> Welcome to the Time Tales section of Doctor Who Online . Time Tales are Doctor Who dioramas ( picture stories ) , based on characters and worlds inspired by Doctor Who , and written and shot by Malcolm Orr . <p> The Doctor 's hands gripped the console tightly as the room warped around him . Robyn and K9 were stranded on the Progenitor and his TARDIS was being hijacked . Three creatures had broken through into the sanctuary of the TARDIS and were breaking it apart . The creatures were horrific - humanoid in appearance , but it was almost as if entities inside the heads of the creatures were breaking out , collapsing their vestigial faces into loose skin wrinkled underneath their chins . Brain tissue exuded from splits in their foreheads and a large bulbous eye stared out of each creature . They were the Three , and the Doctor knew they were behind the assault on Gallifrey . <p> The Doctor could feel them invading his mind , starting to tear at its edges to induce madness into him . The Doctor glanced behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the TARDIS behind him . Tuk the Fearless was a battle-hardened warrior of the Sxxxx lineage and he saw that the Doctor was under attack . Tuk charged the three alien monsters , but was unable to penetrate a psychic barrier that surrounded them . The Three turned to Tuk and bore into his mind , driving him back . The Doctor , realising he had a momentary reprieve , pressed some buttons on the TARDIS console . The TARDIS engines groaned loudly with the strain of an emergency dematerialisation . The Doctor looked back up at the Three and watched as they faded from the console room . <p> Acting President Borusa could taste the blood that had trickled from his nose down to his lips . His tormentors had n't laid so much as a hand on him , but the searing mental pain they were able to apply was incredible , and Borusa had struggled to keep control . The Three had discovered that Borusa had sent a message to the Doctor 's TARDIS and they had gone to try and capture the time capsule . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were furious . Behind them were Shadows - black ragged shapes that stood in disturbing silence , waiting like foxes sizing up their prey . ' Did we capture the girl ? ' asked the Three . ' Yes , ' grunted one of the Shadows . Borusa looked at the corner of the room where a small alcove hid a huntress in the shadows . He could see that she still wore the talisman he gave her , and it seemed , for now , that she was the only hope that he had . <p> The TARDIS materialised with its usual wheezing-groaning sound . The Doctor walked out of the TARDIS and looked at his surroundings . The ship had landed inside a barn , somewhere on Earth . The door of the barn was slightly ajar and the Doctor looked to see a street . It was medieval certainly - why had Borusa brought him to medieval Earth ? Tuk exited from the TARDIS to see that the Doctor was already leaving the barn . ' Wait ! ' shouted the Sontaran , but the Doctor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' I saved your life , ' Tuk continued . ' Weak as your race are . ' The Doctor left the barn and locked the door , still ignoring the Sontaran . <p> Robyn opened her eyes , but the blackness remained . Her hands and ankles had been tethered down and suddenly she started to panic . A dim light lit the room and the Three entered . Robyn could see that the blackness that surrounded her was comprised of lots of living shadows - dark ragged shapes with bestial faces . The Three approached Robyn and she felt physically sick . ' Where is the Doctor ? ' they asked her , their voices a discordant union . Robyn refused to say , but the truth was that she did n't know . Maybe he was still on the Progenitor where that poor girl , Lee , had been exterminated right before her eyes . It was clear to the Three that Robyn was n't going to willingly help , but they knew they could still use Robyn to find the Doctor . They planned to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the moment they met , and they could use her to learn more about his TARDIS so they could track it now . Robyn refused to submit her mind . ' We thought you might , ' whispered the Three , a hint of glee in their voices ... <p> K9 trundled along the floor of the Progenitor - both the Doctor and Robyn had left the ship and K9 was calculating what he should do about it . He detected a large group of people walking towards him - all genetically identical to the Doctor ( or at least within 0.1% , which was insignificant to most but terribly important to K9 ) . However K9 's scan had shown that there was a merging of the clones artron energy , as if they were forming a group consciousness - a gestalt . ' Hello K9 ! ' they all said in union . Our dear old thing ! Just as the choral greeting had left the Clone Doctors mouths , Daleks swarmed into the area and surrounded the group shouting ' EXTERMINATE ! ! ' as they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protected them and K9 . They all grinned again as the Daleks exploded from within , cracking like boiling eggs in a bubbling pan . The Clone Doctors and K9 made their way back towards the cloning lab onboard the ship . <p> When you had travelled in time and space as much as the Doctor had , one could tell just from the smell and taste of the air where and when you had landed . This was even truer when it came to the Earth , at least in the Doctor 's case . He knew he was in France , and that the year must have been 1547 A.D. or thereabouts . Borusa had forced the TARDIS to land here , but the Doctor was unsure why . The Doctor could hear screaming from inside a local house followed by the abrupt opening of a wooden door . Two men were dragging a third man out from the building despite the protests of a woman , who probably was , the Doctor thought , the mans wife . ' This man needs to see a doctor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the woman . ' Hello ! ' said the Doctor . ' I 'm the Doctor - not just any common or garden doctor you know , he interjected with a broad and disarming grin . Problem gentlemen ? ' . The men grudgingly agreed to let the Doctor take over from here , and the Doctor helped the woman take her husband back in the house and sat him down on a chair . The Doctor soon learned that the man was called Michel and that he had had a fever . The woman told the Doctor that he was in Lyon , France , and that there had been a plague here recently , but what had been happening to Michel had been even more disturbing . Michel had been burning up with a high fever as if possessed by brimstone and sulfur and shouting gibberish at the top of his voice . The Doctor looked at Michel , realising that his face was vaguely familiar . Suddenly the man bolted upright , his body contorting violently , his eyes bulging from their sockets and he was screaming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A glib talker with a quick tongue , Shall destroy the Sanctuary of the Gods , To the Heretics he shall fling wide the door , So stirring the Heavens to War ... " <p> Michel de Nostredame collapsed back onto the chair , unconscious . ' Nostradamus , ' the Doctor muttered . <p> The Three looked directly at Robyn . ' We could help you save Lee , ' they said . Her young life extinguished by the Daleks , but you could change that. The Three told Robyn that if she submitted her will to them that they would save Lee by removing her from time just before she was exterminated . Robyn could feel tears welling up in her eyes - she could save Lee from death , but she knew it would come at a cost - the Three would use her thoughts and experiences since she met the Doctor to track the TARDIS and him . ' Will you serve us ? ' they asked Robyn . ' No , ' she sobbed , tears now streaming down her face . ' Then maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ replied the Three . An image of Earth was displayed in front of her . ' Unleash the Abomination , ' ordered the Three . In response to their words a small blue seed formed in the hand of one of the Three . From this , devastation will grow. The seed faded from his hand . Within moments many thousands of snake like tendrils , each one with huge barbs started to emerge from the crust of the Earth . ' Submit your mind to us , serve us and help us locate the Doctor , and we will save the Earth , including the life of your father . ' Robyn could barely breathe and she was becoming hysterical - the Three were willing to rip apart Earth just to get her to betray the Doctor , and deep down she knew she had to refuse ... <p> The Doctor had met some famous people in his time . In fact get him on a table with a few bottles of ginger beer and a bowl of jelly babies and hed talk to you about them for hours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the people the Doctor met helped to shape history , but Nostradamus claimed to predict it . The Doctor was sure this was linked to why Borusa brought him here , but was not yet sure how . Nostradamus bolted up in bed again , the madness and fever had returned to his face : <p> " Serpents will rise from the earthen cage , Where the children of man are sleeping , The old and fathers shall emerge from their hell , Only to hear the screaming of the offspring . " <p> The Doctor 's face was unusually grim . Nostradamus was predicting Armageddon on a grand scale , and the Doctor was not remotely skeptical about his predictions . He could sense a great power inside Nostradamus , something alien in origin . A loud crack broke the thoughts of the Doctor and he spun around . Standing in the doorway was Tuk who at least had the common sense to wear his helmet . ' You need to return me to the war , Time Lord , ' Tuk demanded . ' If you want war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is going to come to us . ' <p> In London , 7th December 2009 , Professor Brooks watched his TV in horror . He stumbled backwards and half-fell into the chair behind him . The TV was showing images of utter devastation from around the world . Huge twisted tendrils seen rising from the crust of the Earth into the sky creating massive Earth quakes and tsunamis . He could hear the screams outside , alongside police sirens , alarm bells , the roaring of motor cars . Chaos had descended on the Earth and Professor Brooks could feel a searing pain across his chest . Where was Robyn ? <p> On the Progenitor the Clone Doctors suddenly became aware of the devastation on Earth . ' We must save the Earth , ' they exclaimed in unison , ' we rather like it ! ' K9 asked them to clarify . ' We have detected a devastation across space and time and we must go there to prevent it . It 's what the Doctor would do . ' K9 was confused - the gestalt group of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time and space , perhaps they were growing in power . K9 searched his record banks and confirmed that there were no known cases of so many Gallifreyan clones being in close proximity to each other - the consequences of such a situation were likely to be unique . ' We must go there straight away , and you must join us , ' suggested the Clone Doctors . K9 did not know how they planned to get across the whole of time and space without the Doctor 's TARDIS . ' Time is immaterial ! ' they replied , still with that fixed broad toothy grin . Within seconds K9 and the Clone Doctors faded from view . Onboard the Progenitor the Supreme Dalek heard the report that the clones had somehow left the ship . His mission had failed , though his army was the only survivors . They would have to continue their military campaign without the capture of the clones . He ordered that the battle fleet should progress towards their primary target - Gallifrey . <p> Leela sneaked along a short alcove in a corridor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ escorting Borusa back from the interrogation chamber to his quarters . Leela could sense the creatures approaching and lunged at them as soon as they were in striking distance . Leela could remember when she first saw the Shadows . The creatures suddenly appeared on Gallifrey with no warning , and the Chancellory Guards who protected the Time Lords were easily outmatched by the creatures . Suddenly distracted from her memories , Leelas warrior instincts kicked into action . Leela 's knife tore into the first Shadow creature and it screamed as a black acrid fluid dripped to the floor . The second Shadow creature shimmered as Leela lunged towards it and Leela 's knife harmlessly passed through it . She grabbed Borusa by the hand and tried to help him escape . She ran down the corridor , helping Borusa to keep up though he was still in a lot of pain . As she rounded a corner she skidded to a halt . Robyn stood in front of her , surrounded by more of the Shadow creatures . Robyn looked different - she was dressed in a black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ markings twisted all over her face . She was one of them now . Robyn grabbed Leela by the throat and hoisted the warrior up into the air . Leela struggled but could not break Robyn 's grip . Robyn laughed in delight ... <p> The Doctor could hear screaming from the street outside and so he looked out of the window . Black shapes were coalescing in the street outside as Shadow creatures were materialising . ' They are here ! ' the Doctor exclaimed . ' We only have a few moments - they will try to search out the TARDIS first , then us . ' Tuk grinned and rubbed his fist . ' Then we can fight them ! ' he rejoiced . The Doctor said they needed to get Nostradamus away from the pursuers . Nostradamus was the key to this whole affair , and unless the Doctor could work out why they had no chance of defeating their enemies . Nostradamus ' wife , Anne , looked worried , more so after hearing the Doctor 's comments . Tuk realised that the Doctor was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ predictions to see that the woman needed reassurance . Tuk was a Sontaran , grown in a lab to be the perfect warrior , but even he could see the need to offer this woman some comfort . The Time Lord looked like a human , Tuk thought , but he was definitely an alien underneath . Tuk placed a heavy hand on the Anne 's shoulders . ' We will help him , ' Tuk consoled her . The Doctor glanced up ; half realising he 'd not even seen Anne 's distress in the first place . He grabbed Nostradamus by the shoulder and motioned for Tuk to help him . ' We need to get him to safety or everyone will suffer . Help Marie to safety . ' Tuk helped escort Marie outside , away from Nostradamus . But he could not wait to return and fight the Shadow creatures . <p> Professor Brooks ran out from his house and stood in the middle of the street . Some of his neighbours were already standing there , and each of them , just like him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's the end ! ' one of them screamed , ' Arma-bleedin ' -geddon . ' Suddenly the ground shook violently , throwing them all down on the tarmac . When Brooks stood back up he could see that several buildings had cracked , and one or two had even fallen . But most noticeably of all was a huge organic tendril that had smashed its way through the surface of the Earth , maybe about 5 miles away , and reached up past the clouds . It was a sickly blue , and the tendril was twisted and pitted and terrifying . Just like the pictures on TV from around the world , but this time it was n't just a picture on TV . This time it was there , right in front of him , and the ground started to tremble again ... <p> Robyn had often wondered about the Doctor 's home world - Gallifrey . The Doctor had often played it down when he spoke of it , almost dismissively , but she had always known that there was a special place in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a mysterious place - full of old dusty secrets , more like arcane forbidden knowledge than scientific marvels , but now she was possessed by darkness and the power granted by the Three , Robyn could sense the whole of Gallifrey and she could sense the time-space vortex . The Three had offered her the chance to stop the extermination of Lee or the destruction of Earth , and finally she had agreed to their wishes , to make a sacrifice to save her world , but now she was one of them she did not care for the Earth anymore , or Lee , and the Three did not recall the Abomination from Earth . Her sacrifice had been for nothing in the end . <p> The Doctor and Tuk had barely managed to get Nostradamus out of his room before they could hear the ravenous howling of the Shadow creatures . They had managed to sense the Doctor 's scent and had launched themselves at the side of the house , scaling its surface with an almost supernatural skill . Townsfolk screamed and crossed their chests as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Doctor and Tuk helped Nostradamus up onto a horse drawn cart and started to ride the cart away from Nostradamus ' house , just as the Shadows appeared in the courtyard . The Shadows screamed as they realised their prey were escaping before starting to pursue them once more . The Doctor was driving the horses as fast as they could whilst Tuk looked at their pursuers . ' So they want to fight ! ' he roared . ' Then fight they will ! ' As Tuk stood on the end of the cart , ready to face the Shadows , Nostradamus writhed again : <p> " The prodigal expelled from the city Shall be angered by the foreign alliance , The army of the eyes shall be defeated Weapons of hearts , weapons of minds . " <p> Robyn looked at Leela with disdain . Leela was trying to break free from the grasp of two Shadows who were taking her towards an execution chamber on Gallifrey . Robyn could barely remember her life with the Doctor anymore the influence of the Three had pushed the personality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her mind . Robyn was a mere vessel now a vessel for the will of the Three . Even now they were using her memories to learn more about the Doctor . She knew they had tried that with Leela before her , but Leelas mind was far too savage to be of use to them . They stopped at the execution chamber . You will not defeat me , challenged Leela . Robyn looked at the creature with pity . I 'd rather die than serve the Evil Gods. Robyn felt something stir inside her the last vestiges of her old self trying to break back through . She had once fought monsters , fought evil alongside the Doctor , and now she was that evil . Except she was n't , was she ? Kill her , she could hear herself command , but inside her mind a small part of her was screaming . <p> Professor Brooks looked out towards London to see in the distance a huge tendril reaching into the sky . All around the world these demonic shoots had broken through the Earth and threatened to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collapsed some of the buildings in the surrounding area and the world was in utter chaos outside . What are they ? Professor Brooks asked rhetorically . An alien weapon of war Gallifreyan to be precise ! Professor Brooks turned around to see the people who seemed to answer his question in chorus . Professor Brooks was speechless it was the Doctor , or rather about 12 Doctors , all grinning , and K9 was in the midst of them . K9 explained that the group of Doctors were clones and had started to merge into a group mind . The Clone Doctors looked across the Thames to see the huge tendril in the sky . The Abomination , they said in awe . The Abomination ? echoed Professor Brooks . It will mean the end of this world , replied the Clone Doctors . <p> The High Council of Time Lords had gathered inside the Council Chamber . Hedin looked at Borusa , standing at the head of the line of gathered Time Lords . Borusa had aged dramatically during his sessions of mental torture , as they all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he had always shown in all of his incarnations . Robyn entered the chamber , followed by four Shadows . Borusa flinched ever so slightly as Robyn approached him . ' The time has come for you to tell us - where is the Wisdom of Rassilon ? ' Hedin saw Borusa laugh . The ' Wisdom of Rassilon ' was a term that Hedin did not recognise . ' Within the Doctor 's grasp , ' replied Borusa , ' and he will defeat you all . ' <p> Two Shadows started to bear down on the Doctor 's cart , frothing at their black mouths and feral in their determination to track down their prey . Tuk grabbed a pitchfork from the cart and smashed one end hard into the face of one of the Shadow creatures . It started to shimmer as its body phased into pure energy . Tuk shouted at the Doctor who grabbed the Sontaran and asked him to keep on driving the horses . The Doctor gripped the pitchfork and swung it at the Shadows , but like Tuk he found that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' It 's no use , Doctor ! ' Tuk warned . ' They just fade ! ' The Doctor grabbed his sonic from his pockets and shouted to Tuk that the creatures could phase to protect themselves , but it would likely drain a lot of energy and they could n't keep it up for very long . However the sonic emissions would hopefully complicate matters further for the Shadows by destabilising the space around them , forcing them to phase back . The sonic screwdriver was buzzing away as the Doctor swung it towards the Shadows . After a couple of swings the creatures materialised back into solidity and started to spin backwards allowing the cart to escape . ' Sontar-HA ! ' Tuk roared in delight . ' Please do n't do that , ' replied the Doctor , ' it 's - ' Suddenly there was a loud crack as the right wheel of the cart hit a stone and threw the occupants of the cart roughly to the side of the road . The two Shadows , and some of their brethren , started to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... <p> Leela waited in the execution chamber , her hands tied above her head . She continued to wrestle with the bonds that were holding her . Shadow creatures hovered behind her , waiting for Robyn to arrive to oversee the execution . The door opened and Leela glared towards its direction - a last show of rebellion . Robyn was not at the door . Instead there was a small tin dog . It was K9 Mk1 - the original version built by Professor Marius . He had stayed behind on Gallifrey with Leela . A Time Lord stood behind the dog - it was Andred , her husband , though he was no longer a Guard but a Councellor . K9 blasted the Shadows , vaporising them , as Andred freed Leela from her bonds . As they turned to escape Robyn stood in the door . Robyn saw K9 and shook her head . Leela saw the woman drop to the floor . ' She is fighting the possession , ' Leela noticed . ' She 's dying Leela , ' replied Andred , who was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her , ' protested Leela . Andred was not happy - trying to help Robyn would ruin their chances of escaping , and he did n't even know whether she would recover as her normal self or whether she would remain possessed . Leela made the choice for them by barricading the door and locking them inside . K9 scanned Robyn : ' Life signs fading , ' he warned . Outside the chamber gathered more Shadows .

@@109708824 @5108824/ <p> With a history as long as Doctor Who it is inevitable for some of the shows more popular assets to appear every once in a while . Whether it is a popular companion , a recurring organization such as UNIT or even a previous incarnation of the Doctor himself , the programme thrives on the energy that a familiar face or two brings when they pop up after a while away from the series . Not to mention the buzz of nostalgia it can create . <p> Then , of course , there are the villains , monsters and evil beings from beyond our world , and sometimes FROM our world . The most iconic and popular adversaries will always be The Daleks , who have delighted and terrified viewers from the second ever Doctor Who story . They have returned , time and time again , including every year since 2005 in some shape or form and will always be cherished as the Doctors ultimate adversary . <p> The Macra as seen in Doctor Who ' The Macra Terror ' ( 1967 ) . <p> Following them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then The Sontarans , Silurians , Ice Warriors , Autons , Weeping Angels and more recently The Silence made two visits to the whoniverse last series . They can always be called upon to do battle with the Doctor and create memorable moments and favourite episodes . <p> Some you do n't  think you will ever see again and then they suddenly appear , without any warning ( unless your into your spoilers ) . When David Tennant uttered the word " Macra " in the 2007 story Gridlock , I could n't believe it . I was beaming that a forty-year-old monster had returned from the smokescreen ( in this case literally ) and I was very pleased that the Radio Times had n't  given that one away . <p> But what about those unsung heroes of the carnival of monsters ?

Making their only TV appearance in 1964s The Keys of Marinus . The Voord were supposed to be sleek , dark suited beings from the planet Marinus , who had the ability to resist the Conscience of the planet . They were humanoid in build , and could use telepathy to communicate with each other . They 're leader , Yartek , posed as the Marinusian Arbitan to steal the keys from Ian Chesterton , yet was killed when he placed a fake key in the Conscience . <p> The Voord were created as a potential rival to The Daleks ' early popularity , and even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appeal was not great though and The Voord were never seen again after they 're debut . One reason could be the silly feet the actors playing the creatures were given . The other could be because they did n't  get enough screen time or maybe just because creative masterminds of the show had better aliens they were developing . Yet I think that with a little tweak here and there they could be reintroduced to take on the Doctor once again . <p> The Toymaker ( Michael Gough ) - ' The Celestial Toymaker ' ( 1966 ) . <p> My next candidate is The Celestial Toymaker , who also made his only appearance in a William Hartnell story of the same name .

He trapped The Doctor , Steven and Dodo in his world of dangerous games and killer toys , and if he loses his games , his world is destroyed . He had the power to turn The Doctor invisible and manipulate and bully those in his control @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , since a story was commissioned called The Nightmare Fair , which would have seen Colin Bakers Doctor battle The Toymaker yet again , but it was unfortunately abandoned when the show was put on Hiatus in 1985 . Big Finish Productions finally made the story in 2009 as an audio and The Toymaker has made appearances in comic strips and novels since his debut but he never returned to the show on television . <p> Even though we have had The Dream Lord recently , who is a similar character to that of The Toymaker , I see no reason that the character couldnt return at some point in the future . The kind of story that would suit The Toymakers character would have to be psychological and scary , something that is missing from his only appearance in 1966 . <p> Another villain who would excite us fans is The Doctors fellow Time Lord Morbius . Originally Morbius was once head of the High Council of Time Lords who had been trialed and sentenced to death by his people . Yet his brain survived , rescued by mad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body for Morbius . <p> The classic Tom Baker story The Brain of Morbius , was made during one of the golden ages of Doctor Who . Producer Phillip Hinchcliffe and Script Editor Robert Holmes formed a superb partnership during Tom Bakers first three seasons and the hammer horror influence of Morbius made for one of the strongest stories in this era . <p> Although the Sisterhood of Karn chased Morbius off a cliff face , his brain still could have survived . Many fan productions over the years have questioned this ' what if ' scenario to good effect ( especially Matthew Tolofolos brilliant action figure series ) and with the Time Lords and The Master trapped in The Time War , the evil Gallifreyan could once again lock horns with The Doctor if he could obtain another body to house his twisted mind . <p> My next choice was only on screen for a few minutes , yet it formed one of the most memorable scenes in the twentieth anniversary story , The Five Doctors . Yes , you 've guessed it , its the Raston Warrior Robot . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dicks , The Raston Robot is a lightning quick , silver and agile warrior who has built-in weapons such as lances and disks , which could kill you if you make the slightest movement . He puts a halt to the Third Doctor and Sarah Jane Smiths journey to Rassilons Tower in the death zone . <p> The scene where the robot massacres a party of Cybermen is one of the best set pieces of the story , possibly even eighties Who . The quick cutting and graphic decapitations of heads and limbs had the adrenaline pumping around my ten year old body when I first saw it . Never have The Cybermen been so out-maneuvered and outwitted by one creature so quickly before . <p> I would love for the Raston Robot to return yet I struggle to think how . You could n't have an army of them invading Earth slaughtering the human race , as it would be too violent to even contemplate making . Maybe having it destroy fellow robots such as The Cybermen or Voc Robots in a war would be a better idea to bring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Isnt it about time those robots of death made a comeback ? Theyre only appearance in 1977 is frequently in the ' top ten Doctor Who stories ever ' second coming has never been on the cards . <p> A Zygon as seen in Doctor Who ' Terror of the Zygons ' ( 1975 ) . <p> Yet another favourite monster of mine also made their only appearance during the Tom Baker era . The Zygons , shape shifting aliens whose pet Skarasan turns out to be the fabled Loch Ness Monster - they could morph into human form , and they 're leader , Broton , planned to take over the world so it was ready for a fleet of refugees from The Zygons ' home planet to colonize after the human race are overthrown . The physical appearance of The Zygons ; orange organic and blobbly , is one that would not need to be tweaked and in my eyes they were one of the most believable adversaries of the classic series . The costume of one currently stands proudly at The Doctor Who Experience and still looks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with another fleet of Zygons hibernating in the deepest depths somewhere else in the world . Maybe they are creatures that are behind the mysterious Bermuda Triangle ? Its time we saw them again ! <p> There could be a time in the not so distant future where London is invaded by WOTANs War Machines again . What if WOTAN actually survived and was the machine behind the internet and we were all plugged in ready for an invasion right in our living rooms and the danger becomes even more real and threatening . A story like that would stop some people talking too loudly on they 're mobiles on buses that 's for sure ! <p> There are those , who rather unfortunately never lived up to expectations and will be remembered as the spotty kid in the class . The one who sticks out like a sore thumb in any situation . The Myrka , for example , if made today , would be a convincing CGI effect towering over The Doctor and his friends ready to strike fatally . However , it will forever be remembered as the floppy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ takes and is the monster we remember like a bad memory . <p> Spare a thought for the poor Monoids . The Beatle haired , eyeball in the mouth slaves who became overlords of their human masters . They are iconic in appearance , but , sadly the word I use to describe them is ' naff ' . So are the Quarks . Not at all scary or threatening and the design ruins their premise . How they became the main villains in the comic strips in the late sixties AND warranted a mention in The War Games is beyond me . <p> The Zarbi are another , who due to the budget restraints and limitations of the time , were never fully realized . The creatures were always men in funny costumes to me and not giant insect-like aliens from another world . Even if I suspend my disbelief they still look like the kind of thing you get in a badly thought out childrens play . Maybe that 's why monsters like the Mryka and the Zarbi are frowned upon by most fans . They are the drunk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We try to forget them but they will always be there . Do n't  get me started on The Kandyman ... <p> Maybe the stories they starred in do n't  stand up to close scrutiny ? Maybe it was the way they were written , designed and acted that let their cause down ? Only the very best of the bad have the ability to fight to see another day . A passing mention to Fenric and his Haemovoeres , The Drashigs and The Destroyer must be made since they do have the potential to be rediscovered at some point to threaten our universe again . Unlike Rick Astley , these one hit wonders will never become dated .

@@109708833 @5108833/ <p> One of the winning ingredients of a great story is a believable setting . Giving the audience an identifiable backdrop is one of the surest ways of hooking their attention , which is perhaps why the 2005 re-launch of Doctor Who saw one Earthbound or near-Earthbound adventure after another . Incredibly , it took until Series Two for the Doctor to visit alien shores , in the shape of the Earth-copy world seen in New Earth ( 2006 ) , and the titular planetoid in the two-parter The Impossible Planet/The Satan Pit ( 2006 ) . <p> Russell T Davies and company certainly had a very good precedent to cite when opting to set most of the Doctors travels on or near terra firma : the hugely popular Earth-oriented UNIT stories in the first half of the 1970s . These adventures , with their realistic context , regenerated the series popularity and gave it the sort of viewing figures it had not enjoyed since the heyday of Dalekmania in the mid-1960s . <p> Given that a prepackaged backdrop , such as present-day Earth , presents the audience with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a storyline whose location must be built from scratch in other words , an adventure based on an alien world ? The enormous success of science-fiction series such as Star Trek and Blakes Seven , not to mention the phenomenal popularity of the Star Wars saga , would point to the fact that wholly-alien worlds are to be tackled with great caution , and that it is far more prudent to brave the challenge with an Earth-like planet , populated by human or human-like beings . <p> If the pre-made human colony is not to ones liking , there is always the slightly more difficult path of creating an original society , but still relying upon a human or near-human population ; essentially , a human-style world but several generations removed from the Earth colony from whence it came . Philip Martins world of Varos ( Vengeance on Varos , 1985 ) is a case in point . When he imagined the once-penal colony with its penchant for state-sanctioned violence and push-button justice , he was surely taking the advice of former Doctor Who script editor Eric Saward , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constructing a whole world , with its own political system ( see the DVD special feature Trials and Tribulations on the 2008 The Trial of a Time Lord Box Set ) . Sawards very own planet of Necros ( Revelation of the Daleks , 1985 ) is a prime example of this method , as is Robert Holmes Androzani Minor , with its drug war and endemic corruption ( The Caves of Androzani , 1984 ) ; and Helen As totalitarian regime in the former Earth colony of Terra Alpha in Graeme Currys The Happiness Patrol ( 1988 ) . <p> Of course , in the above options what one really finds is a variety of storylines set on a pseudo Earth pseudo in the sense that either the population , regardless of environment , is human or human-like , or one uncovers the double whammy of both human or human-like beings and an Earth-type world . Either way , the so-called alien setting is somewhat watered down at the very least . <p> However , if one chooses to create a world in which viewers can believe and which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faced with the inescapable problem of presenting an authentic alien civilisation on an authentic alien world . To be sure this is no mean feat . <p> Picking up this particular gauntlet is something which Doctor Who has successfully negotiated on a number of occasions . In these instances the creativity and ingenuity of the production team , and specifically the writer , costume designer and set designer , come to the fore . Of all the examples available , I would like to present three which are rather unusual in that they all hale from the same season : Season Eighteen . <p> To establish the context of my selection its important to understand that all seven of Season Eighteens adventures feature an alien locale ; and only one features the Earth . Aside from my three choices , the rather black and white reason versus faith dichotomy presented by the people of Tigella in Meglos is the weakest ; whilst the wonderfully depicted time-sensitive Tharils of Warriors Gate , as well as the strangely-evolving people of the Starliner in Full Circle , are both noteworthy . <p> My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the opening story , The Leisure Hive ( 1980 ) by David Fisher ; and the second and third form the final two installments : Johnny Byrnes The Keeper of Traken ( 1981 ) and Christopher H Bidmeads Logopolis ( 1981 ) . <p> David Fishers work for the programme reveals an apparent penchant for alien planets ; three out of the four scripts he wrote for the series were based on worlds apart from the Earth . In his 1978 script The Androids of Tara a chivalrous ruling elite delegates the sophisticated business of robot engineering to the peasants ; and in his next story , The Creature from the Pit ( 1979 ) , the metal-scarce planet of Chloris is nearly brought to annihilation by the crass machinations of the scheming Lady Adrasta . <p> It was Fishers final script , The Leisure Hive , which saw his depiction of a wholly-alien people so smartly married to sumptuous costume design , makeup and set , delivering an alien race which not only looked the part but was also in possession of a strong backstory . Set on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ race-wide sterility and the disastrous environmental effects of all-out nuclear war . Both of these factors shape the recent history of the Argolins , who face complete extinction without the seemingly incredible research of an Earth scientist , Hardin , who claims to have made a breakthrough in the field of temporal engineering . In the three key Argolin figures of Morix , Mena and Pangol one finds the past , present and future of Argolis artfully played out , as Morix finally succumbs to the accelerated ageing process which is destroying his people ; and Mena and Pangol each undergo rejuvenation through the new science developing on their world . <p> The Argolins are in no way a two-dimensional race . As the first adventure in a season seeking to take the series in a fresh direction , Hive sets out to present a realistic alien people with whom the audience can sympathise . By establishing this sense of sympathy the story can unfold in the safe knowledge that the viewers care about the characters not such an easy proposition where aliens are concerned . <p> Johnny Byrnes The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in that , after the more hit-and-miss alien experiments of the intervening stories , there is once more a seamless coming together of script , costume/make-up and set design . Indeed , the Traken people are perhaps the most nuanced alien race for a very long time , and even after more than thirty years and countless intervening adventures it is not so easy to find another alien society quite so well developed . <p> The Trakens , for example , are given a political structure tied together by the unique principle of the ruling Keeper and the bio-electronic source the means by which an entire planetary empire is kept in harmony . The five Consuls of Traken govern with the Keepers guidance and blessing , whilst the Proctors are both the guards and the gardeners of the state . Traken , in short , is a paradise where evil is said to simply wither up and die . Of course , this Eden-like world is soon beset with the most terrible of threats , in amongst which one learns of how the succession of Keepers occurs , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a well-considered world which , in only a four short episodes , presents the viewers with an alien reality that is above all else believable . It is this vital quality which helps to carry the plot and enables the audience to become entangled in events . More , the authenticity of the Traken culture means that it is simply accepted without being gawped at . In this way the audience can sit back and enjoy the story without being distracted by the nature of the unearthly people it involves . <p> With the physically striking and technology-driven Argolins , and the extraordinary politics and governance of the Trakens , my final selection may prove the least impressive . Yet I would advise reflection when attending to the Logopolitans of Logopolis , who , in my view , engage a good deal of curiosity in the manner and style of their society . <p> As anyone who has seen Logopolis will know , the Logopolitans present an intriguing population . Their hive-like city contains a monastic-like society , guarding what is perhaps the greatest secret in the universe . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full episodes the unspoken lives of these seemingly retiring people are given the most skilled spokesman , in the form of the eloquent and gentlemanly Monitor . Amongst his seemingly mute fellow citizens , Monitors role is not unlike that of a living interface , for a city of mathematicians whose inhabitants act like so many bytes in a computer processor because , in a certain sense , this is exactly what they are : living data in an organic computing mechanism , the only device immune to the decaying touch of entropy . <p> As a society , the world of Logopolis could not be more unique . Its extraordinary citizens , ceaselessly calculating away at the edge of space to save the universe from heat death , present one of the rarest alien peoples in the series . Yet the successful act of realising such a civilisation is almost as unusual . Put simply , it is so much easier and less risky to use a prepackaged society , such as an Earth colony or descendants of an Earth colony . In this respect Season Eighteen ought to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presents . <p> There is a fine line to be drawn between the unearthly and the earthly , and to be sure there is a good deal to be said for an exciting story set close to home Jon Pertwee himself once observed that discovering a Yeti on your loo in Tooting Bec is a good deal scarier than finding an equally threatening beastie in some far-off world . But even the great Barry Letts and Terrance Dicks recognised the variety of storytelling provided by the time-space travels of the TARDIS . This is where alien planets come into play . Relying upon the seemingly ubiquitous human colony or post-colony society can become fatiguing , and that is why a good dose of believable extraterrestrial peoples is needed from time to time to give the series that extra dimension . <p> Portraying a race of extraterrestrials is no easy task , and believability is the key test of this portrayal .

@@109708847 @5108847/ <p> The lead-in to The Keys of Marinus is pretty clear : the Voord head out to infiltrate the island and take over the Conscience . I liked that one of the Voord does n't make it though , and the Doctor 's companions do not suspect foul play is involved . So , just how exactly did that poor Voord get both a crack in his submersible and a tear in his protective acid suit ? <p> Yartek scanned the Voord in the room with distaste . None deserved to be here , but the riskiness of the task at hand showed the true colors of the cowards who had not volunteered . Soon their dissent would not matter . Soon he would control the Conscience of Marinus and with that all of the Voords impulses . <p> He did not know the name of anyone in the room . It was not his business to know names . He was , after all , their leader . His name was the only one of importance . He listened as they spoke among themselves , deciphering who would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fortress where the Conscience was stored . <p> Two Voord quickly stood out to him as possible right hand men . Yartek focused all of his attention on them . They were decisive in their judgments of what others said , but not didactic or overbearing . They seemed willing to go the extra mile for the cause of the Voord , even if he had not fully explained that cause to them . In fact , none of the Voord were fully aware of what Yartek sought , only that they were to penetrate the tower on the island , overpower Arbitan , and reclaim the Conscience . <p> The way Yartek saw it , his father had passed on the duty to him to take control of the Conscience and reprogram it to force his own corrupt impulses upon the whole of Marinus . Once he controlled the machine , he would control the planet . His father had failed so many years before , enabling Arbitan to scatter the keys of the Conscience across this alien world that had now become the Voords second home . Where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would not share power . By disposing of his inept father , he had proven that . <p> With that in mind , he called the two Voord to him for further questioning . <p> " Tell me , " he asked them , " Once this is done , what do you hope to happen ? " <p> " Whatever you wish for us , sir . " the taller Voord responded . <p> " And what about you ? " Yartek asked the shorter Voord . <p> " To help you control Marinus , sir . " he said . <p> Yartek nodded . He did not want help controlling Marinus . He wondered exactly what this Voord meant by his comment . <p> " What is your name ? " Yartek asked the shorter Voord . <p> " Ramar " he said with confidence . Clearly he felt that his answer had pleased Yartek . <p> " Well , Ramar , I would like you to join me on this task . " Yartek said and smiled . <p> " Thank you , sir . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taller Voord . " What is your name ? " <p> " Kalt , sir , and thank you , sir . " <p> " I 'm entrusting you both to choose another Voord to join us in this task . The submersibles are waiting for us outside . Meet me there once you have chosen . " Yartek told them and stood up to leave the room . <p> Once he reached the door , Yartek turned to watch how Kalt and Ramar behaved . He saw that Ramar went directly to a specific Voord , while Kalt questioned several . Perhaps Ramar was working with that Voord to take control of the Conscience once Arbitan was killed ? Perhaps they were planning a coup to overthrow him and control Marinus for themselves ? <p> Yartek hurried outside to the submersibles and saw in the horizon a strange blue box appear on the sands of the island that held the Conscience . His paranoia told him it could be aliens coming to steal the Conscience of Marinus . He ran through a list of possible enemies , none of which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the Voords they had chosen came outside then , acid suits in hand . Yartek saw that Kalt carried an extra suit , presumably for him . He also saw Ramar look across the horizon to the blue box . He seemed to be giving a sign to the intruders , and when Yartek looked back to the island , he saw four aliens exit the ship and look out over the acid sea , directly at Ramar . That settled it . They had come to help Ramar kill him and steal the Conscience for their own use . Ramar would not be getting away with this , thought Yartek to himself . <p> " Sir , " Kalt said as he approached Yartek with the extra suit . <p> " Kalt , " Yartek said in a hushed voice , " Come close and tell me , do you wish to prove your worth to me ? " <p> " How , sir ? " Kalt asked . <p> " Ramar is a traitor . I need you to dispose of him , but it must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Kalt replied . Murder was not natural on Marinus , even for a Voord . Arbitan had seen to that with his Conscience machine eradicating all evil thought . <p> " Do you wish to prove your worth or not ? You will be my right hand man once we arrive on the island . " Yartek said . <p> " I will do as you ask . " Kalt said quietly with a curt nod . <p> Kalt quickly walked away to the submersibles . He picked up a rock from the shoreline and tapped the glass of Ramars submersible ever so slightly , causing a tiny crack to form . It was enough for the acid to seep in during the journey under the sea to the island . Yartek smiled . That was quite discreet . He had chosen well with Kalt . <p> " Let me help you . " Kalt pulled on part of Ramars suit and said , " There you go , all adjusted . " <p> " Thank you . " Ramar said . <p> Yartek looked at the suit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like Kalt had caused a rupture in the fabric . It was just enough to make the material permeable to the acid . Yartek nodded at Kalt and then faced the group . <p> " We leave now to the island to take control of the Conscience and restore power to the Voords . I saw from here another alien race trying to steal it for themselves . Their ship lies on the sandy shore . One of you will sabotage their ship , and the rest of you will accompany me to the tower . If you encounter one of these aliens , know they are hostile . Kill them on sight . Do you understand ? " <p> " Yes sir ! " all four of the Voords said . <p> " Then our task begins . " Yartek said and led them to the submersibles . They climbed inside their individual submersibles and set the navigational units for the islands coordinates . This launched the submersibles into the acid sea . Yartek smiled as he thought he could hear Ramars faint screams as he dissolved into nothing inside of his suit .

" <p> The feisty Australian also got up and brushed her knees with her hands before taking The Doctors right arm and pulling him to his feet . If this was The Doctor , she thought to herself , he was still a heavy bloke ! <p> " What about The Master ? " Nyssa asked , shuddering at the very mention of his name .

" Quick back to the TARDIS ! " <p> The trio left the shadow of the Pharos Project , the sun glistening through the metal grills . High above them , a black cable dangled from the complex satellite dish , swinging slowly in the breeze . Moments earlier , that same cable was disconnected , stopping the threat of entropy passing through the CVE .

In front of her , she could see that her companions were having trouble keeping the Doctor up right . His long scarf was hanging low and repeatedly threatened to trip him up . Her eyes grew wide with panic . <p> " Look , they 're catching up with us " she shouted to her friends . <p> They were not the only ones .

As The Doctor grew weaker and his weight began to bog Adric and Tegan down , the guard drew closer , it was only a matter of time before they were captured . <p> Meanwhile , safe within his TARDIS , The Master sniggered at the events he was witnessing on the scanner . <p> " My dear Doctor ... you may live to fight another day but it does n't  mean our game is at an end .

I was fascinated by how he just kind of melted . <p> How did you feel when you got the message telling you that Big Finish wanted you to write for them ? I was totally on cloud nine , completely over the moon . It was completely a dream come true . For weeks I was just beaming and pinching myself . But it was also mixed with an absolute terror that either I 'd mess it up or that I 'd misread the email and they were actually saying ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On top of that I had to keep it to myself . I went for months thinking I was just going to explode . <p> For those that have n't yet heard your audio , can you give us a brief summary , and perhaps a little teaser ? It 's part mystery , part thriller . The Doctor and Peri find themselves with a bunch of humans . They have all lost their memories and need to piece together who they are and more importantly where they are before an impending disaster gets them . Ken Bentley has done such a good job on making it quite a tense 25 minutes . When I heard it for the first time I realised half way through my shoulders were hunched with tension . As for a teaser , it 's hard to say anything without giving it all away , so I 'll just say that there 's potential for a sequel . Or do I mean a prequel ? Certainly I 'd love to bring back Raquel Cassidy 's Destiny Gray . <p> You 've had a long , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ favourite play , and do you have any more coming up ? The first one that springs to mind is Bouncers by John Godber which I did years ago for a company called Brute Farce , working with three other guys who were fantastic . It 's a fast paced , energetic piece and a real joy for an actor to do as you switch instantly from playing the tough bouncer in a tux to a female hairdresser , to a young guy on a night out and back again- all without props or costumes changes , just with your voice and physicallity . As for the future , I 'm in a radio play coming out on wireless theatre next month that I 'll certainly be making Big Finish aware of . It 'd be amazing to be in a play as well as having written one.Finally , if you could have one round trip in the TARDIS , anywhere in time and space , where would you go and why ? That is such a good question . There are so many places I 'd like to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think I 'd squander my trip for the sake of all fandom and go back to the 70s to stop the Beeb junking all those episodes .

@@109708886 @5108886/ <p> Welcome to the Time Tales section of Doctor Who Online . Time Tales are Doctor Who dioramas ( picture stories ) , based on characters and worlds inspired by Doctor Who , and written and shot by Malcolm Orr . <p> It started with an assassination , Doctor . The world went to war over the life of one man according to history , but in truth the Great War was due to imperialistic Governments who wanted it , John Lennon said sadly . Governments wanted war because they wanted power . They did n't  realise that power comes through peace. <p> The war has stopped , even if just for one day , the Doctor replied to John , passing him a crate of food that he had brought from the TARDIS pantry . The Doctor had arrived at John Lennons house moments earlier and he had promised his old friend a trip to the past . The TARDIS had landed in the Allied trenches in the Western Front of Europe in the opening year of World War I. it was Christmas Eve , 1914 , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ candles and placed them out of their trenches , singing Christmas carols . In turn , some British troops had responded in like , lighting their own candles and singing carols . Some soldiers from either side had even tentatively ventured into No Mans Land to swap gifts and good wishes . Artillery fire had stopped temporarily , but both sides commanders would later learn of the Christmas truce and would be furious . <p> Most of them do n't  want to fight , Lennon said , and today they do n't  have to. <p> Carrying a second crate , this time crammed with oranges , biscuits and sweets , the Doctor joined Lennon and they both approached the informal gathering of the British and German troops . The Doctor and Lennon smiled as they both wished them all a Merry Christmas . <p> Later , the Doctor and Lennon made their way back to the TARDIS . <p> Peace on Earth in the midst of a war , lessons to be learned for everyone , Lennon said . I wish the truce could have lasted. <p> A young British @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough to serve in the army , Lennon thought . <p> Are you from the future ? he asked them . You talk as if you are. <p> The young soldier must have been hiding close by when the TARDIS had arrived . Is this the end of the world ? he asked , his voice shaking as if fearing the answer . <p> It gets better , Lennon replied . Eventually. <p> The young soldier smiled at Lennon . <p> It was Christmas Eve , 1979 and the TARDIS materialised with its usual crescendo of wheezes and groans in an alley near to the apartment that John Lennon lived with his wife , Yoko Ono . Only moments had passed since the Doctor and Lennon had left the trenches of World War I but for the Earth it had been almost 60 years . John was still troubled by the words of the young soldier they had just met all those decades ago . <p> Did he live ? Lennon asked the Doctor . Did you check ? <p> We never got his name , the Doctor answered , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sadly . He fought for the imperialist cowards who brought about a war from the safety of their offices. <p> The Doctor smiled warmly at Lennon . This had n't  been the first time that the Doctor had visited John Lennon . He first met him when he was still part of the Beatles , and he had met him a couple of times since then . Lennon had always wanted a trip in the TARDIS , and as a Christmas present to his dear friend , the Doctor had obliged . <p> What about my future ? Lennon asked the Doctor . What legacy do I leave ? <p> The Doctor looked momentarily uncomfortable . <p> There are laws of time , the Doctor replied , and then he hesitated . Maybe , though , just maybe it would be fine this time. <p> The Doctor smiled and opened the TARDIS door for a second time . Time to see the future , the Doctor said , enigmatically . <p> The TARDIS materialised inside a huge guest lounge onboard a spaceship in the 31st Century . The lounge was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guests were enjoying the festivities . <p> The Yellow Submarine ! the Doctor announced as he exited the TARDIS . <p> The Doctor explained that the SS Yellow Submarine was a 31st Century spaceship that was currently on a mission a very important mission on behalf of a peacekeeping foundation . <p> A peacekeeping foundation ? Lennon asked . <p> The Imagine Foundation , the Doctor answered . Named after your song . Even in the 31st Century people from many different worlds are still being inspired by your songs and messages of peace . This is your legacy , John . Merry Christmas. <p> John Lennon looked around the whole area , finding it difficult to take it all in all the people , all the aliens . <p> Look at him with the basin haircut , Lennon said . <p> A Monoid , the Doctor answered . <p> I used to have a haircut like that in the 60s , Lennon added . <p> Yeah , the Doctor replied . I think I did too. <p> The Doctor walked over to a table of food and drink . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alien . <p> Another alien . Its an Alpha Centauran. The Doctor smiled to the alien who had sensed that it was the topic of conversation . Hi Alph ! <p> The Doctor noticed a huge porthole on one wall and pointed it out to Lennon . <p> I think the people onboard this ship have their work cut out for them , the Doctor said . <p> Lennon looked out to see the vastness of space beyond the spaceship , but as beautiful as that sight might have been on another day , chills ran down Lennons spine . A huge silver spaceship coated in threatening barbed weapons hovered in space , easily dwarfing the Yellow Submarine . <p> We are in a warzone ? Lennon asked the Doctor . <p> Right in the middle of one , the Doctor replied , and that 's just a tiddler. <p> Elsewhere , inside a black control room a huge holographic display showed a map of two fleets engaged in war . The red ships represented the fleet of the Havershi Alliance and the green ships represented the Kaathani Protectorate . Both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ becoming increasingly unpopular amongst the civilian populations of both empires . Several Slitheen stood around the holo-display scrutinising the positions of both fleets , calculating the skirmishes occurring and the number of battleships lost . War was business after all . The image shifted to show the SS Yellow Submarine in full view . <p> Ahhhhhhhh ! a shrill voice suddenly , half a sneer and half a laugh . A ship of peace that will escalate a war ! Is our agent in place ? <p> The Slitheen family head , Clor Fel-Fotch Pasameer-Day Slitheen , looked at their employers representative and a sick smile spread across his lips . <p> Our agent is in place , Sil , and soon the war will become an apocalypse . The peace conference will be overshadowed by a massacre. <p> Sils eyes bulged greedily at the thought that very soon the holographic fleets he had just studied would end up as broken shells in space , and the Mentors would be able to sell both sides more battleships to feed their thirst for vengeance . Really , when he thought about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and profit made him happy . <p> A woman approached the Doctor and John Lennon as they peered through the porthole and out into space . She looked in her early-30s , was quite short and had long dark curly hair . She was smiling , but the Doctor could see a worried look in her eyes . A wolfhound , presumably her pet , was standing loyally next to her . <p> Have I seen you both onboard before ? she asked . I really need to see your boarding passes this is a peacekeeping ship on a crucial mission . Millions of innocent lives are at stake , and we really cant have stowaways onboard. <p> The woman looked for a second at Lennon , but if she did recognise him she did n't  make it obvious . <p> OK , said the Doctor as he held out his psychic paper and waved it in front of the womans face , and briefly in front of the wolfhounds face too , for good measure . here 's our Ticket to Ride ! <p> Lennon sighed and leant closer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jokes dont. <p> The Doctor coughed and tried to move the conversation on , but before he could speak the woman spoke again . <p> OK , so your pass checks out , but try and keep out of the way . We have a very unwelcome escort , though we are reassuring them that we are an unarmed vessel seeking peaceful demonstration. <p> Lennon could see a passion in the womans eyes as she talked about her mission she was here risking her life and those of many others so that a terrible war could be stopped , and she knew that it was going to be an almost impossible task . <p> Im Jeniah Tole , head of the Imagine Foundation . This is my pet , Rigby . Welcome onboard the SS Yellow Submarine. <p> Rigby ? echoed John . <p> As in Eleanor , said the Doctor . There 's nothing like obsessive fans , he finished before patting the wolfhound affectionately on the head . <p> Jeniah smiled at Lennon as she turned to leave . <p> Nice Lennon guise , by the way . One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't  think you have the nose quite right. <p> Jeniah and Rigby moved back towards the other alien guests and started to talk into her communicator to ask the bridge for an update on the Kaathani Battlecruiser . <p> Wannabe ? asked Lennon . <p> The Doctor explained that in the future people could change their entire physical appearance with Facial Modulation Surgery , and there was a craze amongst some people to emulate the physical appearances of their heroes they were called Wannabes by the popular press . Lennon was a popular choice , but not as much as Elvis . <p> There 's an entire colony of Elvis Wannabes on a planet called Graceland II , the Doctor added whilst scouring the nearby table . Mince pie ? he offered , holding a tray of them out to Lennon . <p> The Slitheen ship was hidden from sight by a Promethian cloaking device allowing it to approach the SS Yellow Submarine and the Kaathani Battlecruiser without any danger of it being detected by either . Clor Fon-Fetch looked at both ships as they loomed large on the holodisplay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cousin , Jin Fon-Fetch . <p> Jin nodded his head , prompting the Slitheen gathered around the holodisplay to break into a slow , sinister laugh . The Christmas Massacre , Clor grinned . The family will reward us well for this. <p> And reward me too , Sil added . We shall sell more and more battleships , watch them destroy each other , further creating the demand to sell even more ! And the family Slitheen will get their cut. <p> Clor laughed again , echoed by his brethren , but inside his mind he was n't laughing at all . In fact Clor Fen-Fotch had never been more serious he had plans to rise to his rightful position as the Head of the Family Slitheen , and the backing of the Mentors might just be the leverage he desperately needed . <p> The Doctor had decided to head towards the bridge to see what was happening with the Kaathani battlecruiser , but security guards had refused to allow him to leave the lounge that they had arrived in . Undeterred he headed back towards the TARDIS where he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Doctor explained to John that both sides in the war were attempting to reach a peaceful conclusion via delegates at a conference . The SS Yellow Submarine had entered the war zone to show support for the measure to show that the people of both empires wanted peace . The TARDIS was showing the Doctor three spaceships in their vicinity , one of which was hidden from conventional sensors by a cloaking device . Fortunately for the Doctor , the TARDIS was anything but conventional . <p> Interesting , pondered John Lennon , someones stirring up trouble by the looks of it. <p> The Doctor agreed , troubled by the discovery . <p> Jeniah is risking her life , in my name , said Lennon . We have to help her spread peace. <p> The Doctor looked at John and smiled . <p> We will , he replied as he flicked a switch on the console . Remember the Christmas Truce , John . The people did n't  want to fight , at least for one day , and so they didnt. With those words , the TARDIS dematerialised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and fortunately it had arrived in a covert location . The Doctor and Lennon crept out of the ship and looked around . <p> Bit dull , Lennon remarked . <p> The Doctor opened a locker set into one of the walls . Inside he saw several skin-suits hanging up . <p> Slitheen , he muttered . Big green blobby creatures who like dressing up and role playing . And not in a nice way ... <p> The door to the room opened and two Slitheen entered . The Doctor looked at them and smiled . <p> Smith and Lennon , interior decorators . Bit dull around here , how about a lovely coat of TARDIS blue ? <p> Well , if its good enough for Paul " Lennon and Smith , interior decorators " . <p> One of the Slitheen lunged at them , but the Doctor had been expecting it he swerved out of the way and grabbed his sonic screwdriver from out of his pocket . The Doctor and Lennon bolted out of the room , the Doctor spinning around and using the sonic to lock the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Doctor warned . <p> The door suddenly shook as Slitheen hands tried to pound through it . The Doctor and Lennon disappeared around a corner and deeper into the ship . <p> Intruder alert ! announced Rob Slob-Fotch Pasameer-Day Slitheen in the bridge area . Sil looked at Clor , glaring with a mixture of panic and anger , silently demanding to know what was happening . Clor managed to get an image of the intruders on the holodisplay . Who are they ? asked Sil . <p> The Slitheen crowded around the display and peered at the image . <p> They arrived in this , the first Slitheen said , showing a picture of the TARDIS . <p> There was a collective scream from Sil and all the Slitheen . <p> What ? said Rob Slob trying to get to see the holo-display , wondering what was on it . <p> Its him ! Its him ! shouted Sil . <p> He s here ! He s here ! joined in most of the Slitheen . Except Rob Slob who still could n't see who or what had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Doctor meant , but he knew the Time Lord had some kind of plan hatching in his mind . The Doctor opened a door just to reveal a Slitheen behind it . They spun around and took a detour but that corridor was also blocked , once again by another Slitheen . The Doctor held up his hands . <p> You do n't  like interior decorators , do you ? Ca n't blame you , I must say. <p> The Doctor and Lennon were frogmarched into the bridge area by two large Slitheen . <p> Sil , said the Doctor , how unpleasant to see you again . I see that this time you are working with the Slitheen. He slowly looked around the room . You are going to make this war worse , are n't  you ? <p> Sil could hardly contain his excitement . <p> It has been a long time , Doctor , and you may have changed since then , but I always knew I 'd have the chance to finally defeat you. <p> The Doctor listened as Sil tried to goad him , telling him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terms of destruction and profitability . <p> I 'm running this war both sides , Sil explained . The Havershi and Kaathani are meeting to see if they can find a peaceful solution to this war , but the destruction of a peacekeeping ship by a Kaathani battlecruiser should break their Christmas spirit. <p> Lennon was horrified , though the Doctor remained passive , as if he had a trick up his sleeve . <p> I will stop you , the Doctor said quietly . But more importantly , he will stop you. The Doctor pointed towards John Lennon . <p> A war run by a little maniac for his greedy ends , destroying people and spreading misery , Lennon said . But you should listen to what the people want - they will want peace and they will get it. <p> The little people ? The insufferable masses ? The cattle ? If you want to give them guns then I could always sell some to you more weapons , more war , more profit ! <p> They will all be armed , Lennon replied , but their weapons will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Doctor with a sadistic grin on his face . <p> Is that your plan , Doctor ? Sil asked . How far do you think you can get with mere words ? <p> Sil broke out into his irritating laugh once more as he savoured a sweet victory . <p> With his words ? the Doctor echoed . John Lennon a man whose lyrics and words of peace have inspired many generations on many planets ? You 'll see exactly what his words of peace can do very soon , but in the meantime this little runaround of ours has been a good distraction . Enough of a distraction , in fact , for the TARDIS psychic circuits to seek out and destroy the cloaking device onboard this ship . Its been doing that ever since we arrived ! <p> Several panels around the bridge sparked as the Doctor finished his sentence . Sil could see the Kaathani battlecruiser turn towards it as the huge ship had suddenly detected it . The battleship fired laser cannons at the Slitheen ship , attempting to disable it . Realising that the attack had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lennon ran out of the bridge and back towards the TARDIS . <p> Inside the TARDIS the Doctor frantically spun dials and flicked switches . He picked up a covert transmission from the Slitheen ship to the SS Yellow Submarine . <p> The Slitheen must have an agent onboard , the Doctor said , and they are trying to tell it to activate the final phase of their plan . <p> The Doctor managed to jam the signal . <p> That might not stop it for long we have to find their agent quickly. <p> The TARDIS rematerialised back onboard the SS Yellow Submarine and within seconds the Doctor and John Lennon had sprang out through the doors and started running through the ship . <p> How do we find the Slitheen agent ? Lennon asked as they ran . <p> Sorry , apologised the Doctor as he bumped into a man dressed as Santa Claus in the corridor . The Slitheen can disguise themselves as humans , he continued saying to Lennon , but they can only compress so far , so they usually disguise themselves as generously built @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Doctor who was sprinting now through the ship . <p> Like Santa ? Lennon offered . The Doctor skidded to a halt , Lennon bumping into him . They glanced at each other for a split second and then ran back they way they came . <p> Nothing , he said , he must be a Santa Wannabe . Now there 's a novelty . Sorry Santa ! <p> Lennon suggested that they had to find Jeniah and tell her that there was a Slitheen agent onboard the ship . <p> The Doctor and Lennon burst into the lounge where Jeniah was talking to some guests . <p> There 's a Slitheen agent onboard this ship and we are sure its planning something to escalate this war , the Doctor announced to a suddenly stunned room . Problem is the Slitheen are masters of disguise. <p> The Doctor looked around the room to see if anyone fitted the typical description of an undercover Slitheen . <p> Well they fart a lot , the Doctor explained , due to a gaseous by-product of tissue compression. The Doctor coughed . So , err , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rigby , the wolfhound . <p> That 's a new one , said the Doctor , both surprised and a bit impressed . <p> The skin on Rigbys back started to split and a violent blue light poured from it . With a scream that pierced the eardrums of everyone in the room a Slitheen emerged from within the skin . It bolted out of the room and away down the corridor . The Doctor threw a jar of pickles at Lennon and told him that vinegar was lethal to the Slitheen . It could help him pursuade the Slitheen agent . Lennon ran down the corridor after it . <p> The Doctor pulled a computer terminal off a nearby wall and after reprogramming it with the sonic screwdriver he started to scan the ship for any Slitheen technology that had recently been installed . Jeniah asked the Doctor whether the Slitheen had been hiding in the ship that was cloaked before the Kaathani battlecruiser attacked it . <p> Yes , the Doctor replied . They are trying to do something to derail the peace conference , somehow trigger the battleship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look for any trace of Slitheen technology and discovered a few adaptions to the ship . <p> A-ha ! he said . Found you ! <p> The Slitheen agent masquerading as Rigby had managed to install a program in the SS Yellow Submarine that would make it explode as if it had been attacked by the Kaathani battlecruiser . He deactivated the program and checked on the status of the Slitheen ship by looking out of the window . The Slitheen ship had been impounded by the Kaathani battlecruiser and their plan was effectively over . <p> Lennon had the Slitheen cornered and he was waving the jar of pickled onions in front of it . <p> This could kill you , Lennon warned the Slitheen , but I am not a murderer like you or your lot . I do n't  believe in killing whatever the reason. <p> Lennon put the pickled onions on the floor as some security guards arrived and he walked back to where the Doctor was . <p> We have to go to the peace conference , Lennon told the Doctor . When the people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ run by Sils arms dealers they will soon lose their appetite for war . War will be over , Doctor . But only if they want it to be. <p> The Doctor agreed to take the TARDIS to the peace conference , and soon more volunteers were offering to join them . The Doctor realised he had no choice but to transport them all this was their chance to stop a war . <p> The TARDIS materialised at the peace conference where a photo opportunity for the galaxys media had been set up . Lennon and the Doctor stood alongside some other volunteers from the SS Yellow Submarine right in front of them . The Doctor explained to the delegates and the TV cameras that Sil and the Slitheen had tried , and failed , to escalate the war for corporate greed . John Lennon stood forward and spoke to the collected media . <p> This war serves no purpose . The only winners are the warmongers . Put down your arms and fight no more . War is over , if you want it. <p> A slow wave of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sil and the Slitheen stared to play on the galaxy wide media channels . <p> The Doctor turned to Lennon , All we are saying <p> is give peace a chance , Lennon completed , smiling . <p> Within seconds all the protesters were clapping , stamping and singing in chorus : <p> ? All we are saying , is Give Peace a Chance ! ? ? All we are saying is Give Peace a Chance ! ? <p> And soon , everyone else , including all the peace delegates , had joined in . <p> The Doctor and Lennon were about to enter the TARDIS , ready to take the protesters back to the SS Yellow Submarine . Kaathani and Havershi representatives approached Lennon and told him that they would make renewed efforts to find a way for peace , calling for an immediate cessation of hostilities . They promised that the war would be over and that they would give peace a chance . <p> A Christmas truce , the Doctor whispered to Lennon , and not our first today. <p> Christmas Eve , 1979 , Earth <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did it Doctor , smiled John Lennon . We did it . Thank you for showing me the future . There will always be politicians who try to go to war , but there will always be people willing to rise up for peace. <p> John Lennon walked a few more steps down the alleyway . The Doctor was still standing by the TARDIS . <p> Are n't  you coming in for a drink ? Lennon said , pointing towards his door . <p> I 've got to be getting back to Amy , he said . Shes shopping on Oxford Street and I 'll probably need all the space inside the TARDIS just for the shoes. <p> What about next year then ? Youll have to come back next Christmas , or the year after. <p> A pang of sadness reached the Doctors hearts . He turned around and closed the TARDIS doors . Next year was 1980 . He straightened his bow tie and smiled at John . <p> It ended with an assassination , the Doctor whispered to himself and he looked down on the Earth whilst standing inside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peace is eternal. <p> As the Doctor looked down , he imagined the Christmas dinners being eaten and the crackers being pulled , the presents being given . <p> He also thought of those who did n't  have such things , those suffering from poverty and war . <p> War is over , if you want it , mused the Doctor to himself . <p> It was n't only just a message of peace it was a message to do something about it . To make your voice heard . To encourage people to stand up and find ways to hold hands across all the nations . Peace on Earth . And the Doctor knew that someday the humans would find a way to achieve that . Lennons message of peace would never die , the Doctor thought as he smiled to himself .

Not only do we get the annual exchange of presents but it is also the perfect chance to slump in front of the television and get our seasonal dessert of Doctor Who . It is the perfect time to gather round with the family and sit back and enjoy a jolly slice of the good Doctor on a day that was just made for a character like him . <p> We have been served our usual slice of Christmas Who every year since the show returned back in the mid noughties and in that time we have met a new Doctor , born on that day the Sycorax invaded Earth , a runaway bride that we would get to know a whole lot more and a disaster movie scenario involving a spaceship by the name Titanic being sabotaged and crashing towards our planet .

But they would be wrong . We have to go back a lot further than that . Let 's set the controls for Christmas Day 1965 . <p> Yes , forty years before David Tennants festive debut , the First Doctor was in the middle of one of his most epic and dangerous adventures ever .

There has never been another episode of Doctor Who like it . It plays out like a comedy , and acts as a refreshing interlude from all the seriousness and violence of the preceding six episodes yet it does unfortunately takes the reality out of the story . <p> On the surviving soundtrack , the episode sounds very chaotic and the scenes when the time travelers have a brush with the thin blue line fail to fill me with seasonal warmth . Then right at the very end of the episode , William Hartnell does the unthinkable . He turns to the camera , looks straight down the lens to the viewers at home and wishes them a Merry Christmas .

He has to cover Roses difficulty to adjust from one Doctor to another , an alien invasion on Christmas morning , render the Tenth Doctor unconscious for half the episode then awake him just in time to save the day and give us the now traditional stuffing of everything we relate with Christmas . You have got Santas , albeit robot killer Santas , Christmas trees , okay , KILLER Christmas trees and all the emotional moments that go hand in hand with this time of year .

That 's what we need at Christmas , the people we love most around us to share in the festivities with , because we all know that spending Christmas alone ca n't be fun . <p> Although I like The Runaway Bride for some reason it just is n't Christmassy enough for me . It is probably the only Christmas Special I could watch at any given time in the year . Maybe it was because it was filmed during a heat wave in July ( Have you ever seen a December THAT sunny ?

No not THAT Titanic .

When the Doctor arrives to rescue Rose , she pleads for the Dalek , forcing him to choose between compassion and revenge for the extermination of his people . <p> This is a limited edition of 900 pieces . <p> Submitted : <p> 28/9/2008 <p> Reviewer : <p> Doctor Who Online <p> When DWO heard that the Weta team were turning their hands to a brand new range of Doctor Who statues , we were literally brimming with excitement - especially after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of products . <p> The 12 inch Dalek statue is a faithful representation of the new series style Dalek . From the high quality paintwork right down to the intricate detailing on the Dalek creature within , it is clear to see just how much time and effort has gone into the making of this piece . <p> Even parts which are not directly on display such as the inner flaps of the Dalek attack systems , are given just as much attention to detail . Also worthy of note is the Dalek skirting panels , which give an authentic war-weathered appearance whilst the shading on the bumps help to add fantastic depth . <p> With a weight of over 10 lbs , the statue is by no means light , but this works to its advantage making the Dalek both robust whilst also feeling like you 're getting more for your money . <p> Each statue also comes with a stand which the Dalek neatly slots into . The reverse of the stand is hand-signed by Weta sculptors , David Tremont and Daniel Cockersell , and is individually numbered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little assembly is needed , just the eyestalk , plunger and gun , which all slot into place with ease . The statue is packaged neatly and intelligently , with little room to move during transit , and the striking box design makes the buyer want to delve right in , regardless of age . <p> The guide price of -160.00 is extremely good value for money considering all the detail , love and care that has gone into the product . With so many Doctor Who related items on the market , the Weta Dalek definitely stands out , making it a must-have item for any fan of the show ! 
@@109708906 @5108906/ <p> The inspiration behind the original concept of Doctor Who is not the most mysterious of territories . Sydney Newmans teatime television venture was born out of a number of ingredients , the central plank of which being H.G. Wells groundbreaking novel The Time Machine ( 1895 ) , which sees a Victorian inventor breach the fourth dimension and travel into the far flung future . <p> The cover of H.G Wells ' novel , ' The Time Machine ' ( 1895 ) . <p> For science-fiction aficionados , Wells legacy is well known and stretches far beyond his slim narrative on time travel . Along with that other nineteenth-century visionary , Jules Verne , Wells set out the concepts and ideas which , as the twentieth century unfolded , became a brand new literary genre and gave rise to such writing greats as Isaac Asimov , Frank Herbert , Karl Vonnegut and J.G. Ballard . <p> Wells Victorian innovator may well have been the mainspring for the mysterious Doctor , whose adventures have captivated children and adults alike for nearly half a century , but there happens to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known , and whose resemblance to the Doctor is really quite remarkable . <p> Persuaded by the mysterious Doctor Omega to accompany him in his studies , Borel soon finds himself a crewman aboard Doctor Omegas custom-built ship , the Cosmos , for its maiden voyage into time and space . In no little time the ship and its crew are fetched up upon the eerie landscape of Mars in the long distant past , and face to face with the planets curious inhabitants . <p> In itself , the story is an engaging but by no means complicated affair , and its style owes much to the works of Wells and Verne . But for Doctor Who fans there is a little more to consider . For the similarities between Galopins turn-of-the-century scientist-cum-inventor , and Newmans 1963 protagonist are striking . <p> First , unlike Wells time traveller , Doctor Omega is a stranger possibly an alien cut off from his own kind . Second , his people possess the power to travel through time and space through a rare metallic element known as stellite . Third , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ William Hartnells Doctor , and his appearance as represented in the original French illustrations by E. Bouard and J.M. Breton echoes this likeness . Lastly , he constructs an incredible vessel , the Cosmos , which , through the presence of stellite , enables him to travel in time as well as space . <p> As well as its obvious echoes in the world of Doctor Who , its noteworthy that this book is not only translated by the Lofficiers , but also adapted and retold . This means that the English version has undergone something of a minor makeover , which irons out the occasional piece of tired plotting and emphasises the possible association between Gallifreys most famous son and Galopins marooned scientist . <p> The cover of Lofficier 's retelling of ' Doctor Omega ' ( 2003 ) . <p> Of course , the connections listed above are perfectly reasonable coincidences , and given that Galopin was following in the footsteps of Wells , as Newman himself did a little over half a century later , its little wonder that a degree of similarity exists between the two .

Barbara and her Menoptera warn the spearhead of the oncoming danger , but it is too late and the rest of the Menopteran army land . The Zarbi set about them seemingly making light work of their slaughter . <p> Episode Five - ' Invasion ' <p> Barbara and some Menoptera are chased into a crevice by an incoming horde of Zarbi and larvae guns . They find themselves in a Temple of Light , a series of secret underground temples laced around Vortis . Here they encounter a splinter cell of other surviving Menoptera . The creatures are desolate and state that they are not creatures of war . They turn to Barbara in an effort to help them into the mindset of warfare . Barbara asks what their plan was if the onslaught of Menoptera was successful . One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cell Destructor .

Barbara states that the only way forward is to try to use it . <p> Meanwhile , back at the Carsinome , whilst the Zarbi are distracted by the battle with the Menoptera , it is revealed that Vicki is not actually under the influence of the harness as the Doctor 's experiments rendered that particular harness useless . Vicki releases the Doctor from his harness and the Doctor and Vicki catch a Zarbi using the functioning harness . Somehow the Doctor is able to control how the Zarbi moves and the two friends escape along with the Zarbi . <p> In the cave , the creatures , now known as the Optera , have agreed to lead Ian and Vrestin to the centre of the Animus , leading the way underground .

The Menoptera inform the Doctor that the Animus dwells in the very centre of the planet and draws power from the magnetic poles of the planet . It is this , and its subsequent effect on gravity , that are drawing the moons towards Vortis as well as the explanation as to why the TARDIS was forced to land . The Doctor decides that he will take the Destructor back into the Carsinome and destroy the Animus himself from the inside .

The rest of the gang press on . <p> The Doctor and Vicki are brought to the centre of the Carsinome and are instantly blinded by the light cast off by a large web-like brain with many tendrils stemming from it like roots . As soon as they enter the room the Animus informs them that it is going to smother them with its tentacles and absorb their intelligence in order to master space travel . The two travellers seem unable to resist this hypnosis and move towards the Animus . <p> Barbara and the Menoptera find themselves where the Doctor and Vicki were previously being held . Barbara discovers the astral map and states that she could use this device in order to help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pictos . As Barbara attempts to do this they stumble upon the Isotope that the Menoptera gave to the Doctor and deduce that if the Doctor had left this behind he must have been taken by force . They decide to hunt the Doctor out and save him . They soon find themselves at the centre of the Carsinome where they too are overpowered by the light of the Animus . The Animus also is able to block Barbaras use of the Isotope weapon . It seems that Barbara and the Menoptera are going to succumb to the Animus when he is briefly distracted by the emergence of Ian and Vrestin from under the ground . Barbara uses this split second opportunity to kill the Animus and free the Doctor and Vicki . <p> On the surface of Vortis the Menoptera are delighted to find the Zarbi and larvae guns have returned to their previous docile and cattle-like state .

@@109708913 @5108913/ <p> In 2005 a new generation of young viewers came face to face with Doctor Who for the first time . These pre-teens had their conception of the series shaped by Christopher Ecclestons newly-installed Ninth Doctor , whose intense persona marked perhaps the single-biggest departure in the way the Time Lord had been portrayed since the programmes original launch in 1963 . <p> Nearly eight years on , and these same youngsters have now enjoyed no less than six complete series of Doctor Who . Companions have come and gone , old and new foes bested , and all manner of additions made to the shows already weighty lore , including the Doctors ability to abort his regeneration ( Journeys End , 2008 ) , and alter his biology ( Human Nature / The Family of Blood , 2007 ) . <p> Speaking of Time Lordly transformations , weve also had regenerations-a-plenty , courtesy of The Master ( Utopia , 2007 ) , Melody Pond ( Day of the Moon , 2011 ; Let 's Kill Hitler , 2011 ) and the good Doctor on no less than two occasions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ End of Time : Part Two , 2010 ) . Even the mode of regeneration has become a stylised affair , as a fiery release of regenerative energy underlines the biologically explosive nature of the event . <p> Indeed , since Rose Tyler awoke to the day that would radically alter the course of her life ( Rose , 2005 ) , enough water has passed under the bridge for these young fans to have reached their early to mid-teens . They are , therefore , sufficiently removed from their younger selves to look back on their earliest memories of the series and see just how well their remembrances stack up to reality . <p> Of course , the gap between ones long-stored memory and the actual happening can sometimes be huge . Over time the human memory naturally edits the content of an event , adjusting emphasis and tone as well as sometimes deleting whole passages . That 's why reviewing a story from ones childhood can be little short of a mini trauma , as the unfiltered fact collides with ones rose-tinted memories . <p> Misremembering events , often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I like to call it the perception filter phenomenon , after the perception-altering gadget first introduced in Human Nature ( 2007 ) , and later seen to great effect in The Sound of Drums ( 2007 ) . In the latter adventure , we discover this crafty piece of jerry-rigged TARDIS technology enables the Doctor et al . to go unnoticed on the streets of Harold Saxons Britain so long as they remain passive bystanders , that is . In a sense , those life moments with which were less than happy are treated in a distinctly similar way to the perception-filter wearer , as our subconscious carefully edits out , ignores or reshapes the memories we 'd prefer to avoid . <p> So , given how our memory can play tricks with our past , just what happens when we finally sit down and re-watch a story from our formative years , long since matured into a classic piece of storytelling by our younger self ? <p> I have two examples from my own childhood experiences of Doctor Who , one of which lived up to expectations , and one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aided and abetted by an exceptionally inspiring novelisation . <p> The first is City of Death ( 1979 ) - the first story I ever glimpsed . On that quiet autumnal evening in September , my too-young self caught the final moments of Part One and witnessed the unmasking of the spaghetti-faced villain a scene which quite naturally scared me into becoming an overnight fan . <p> Years passed and that grim cliffhanger became the mythical spring from which my devotion to the series sprang . And with no VHS release or novelisation on the horizon , all I had to rely upon for reliving that seminal moment was my own somewhat blurry memory , which inevitably decayed as time passed by . <p> Count Scarlioni ( Julian Glover ) is unmasked . ' City of Death ' ( 1979 ) . <p> Some years later and I managed to get hold of a photocopy of the story archive , as it appeared in Doctor Who Magazine . But with only the odd grainy black-and-white picture of the scary Scaroth to sate my imagination , it was n't until 1991 some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had the opportunity to sit down and digest the complete story . <p> I was n't disappointed , and how could I be ? City of Death presents the Doctors first foreign excursion , courtesy of some lovely location shooting in Paris , along with a tour de force of guest actors , of whom Julian Glovers turn as the suave Count Scarlioni / ruthless Scaroth is surely one of the highlights of the whole series . I adored it . It felt as though the decade-plus since I had first snatched a look at it had simply evaporated . To my eyes it had more than stood the test of time , and to this day almost twenty years on from my initial revisit I feel the very same way . Perception filter phenomenon ? Not this time . <p> The same , sadly , can not be said for my second example , which suffered from my memory adding details to it , which clearly were a result of viewing a certain blockbuster movie franchise of the time , and my later reading of its very fine novelisation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ classic . It has stood up to the intervening years in robust fashion , and widely deserves its status as one of the best stories to involve the Cybermen . More , its portrayal of a companions death , by way of the tragic loss of the young Adric , makes it somewhat of a rarity amongst the Doctors adventures . <p> I originally saw this story whilst enjoying my second full season of Doctor Who in early 1982 . After seeing the opening episode , I can distinctly remember taking a toy motorbike helmet and a stick-gun , and heading for the trench-cum-ditch which ran alongside the football pitch behind my parents flat . There , in decidedly chilly weather , I played at being one of Lieutenant Scotts soldiers , intent on hunting down the shadowy androids in the caves . For sure it was my favourite story of the time ; and with the arrival of a Star Wars double bill at the cinemas later the same year , a firefight involving a melee of laser beams was the default setting for my conception of science fiction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caves in ' Earthshock ' ( 1982 ) . <p> Like City of Death , I had no further contact with Earthshock until its release onto VHS in 1992 . However , unlike the former , I had had the advantage of devouring Ian Marters excellent 1983 novelisation on more than one occasion , and along with a triple dose of Industrial Light and Magics laser battles , my memory of Scott and his team pouring lethal energy from their laser tubes into the Cybermens android puppets had taken on Star Wars-esque proportions . Hence , when I eagerly sat down to re-watch the final gripping minutes of Part One and the opening sequence of Part Two I was left distinctly underwhelmed - and all because my ten year-old memory of the scenes in question had become so distorted as to bear little or no resemblance to the actual televised adventure . <p> Since that disappointing re-acquaintance I have reviewed Earthshock on a good many occasions and , gradually , readjusted my perspective so that my once-exaggerated recollection has been replaced by a more reliable version . I guess this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that a good many post-2005 fans may now be experiencing this revisionist process too , as their young memories collide with the high-definition reality . <p> But their experience will be different again . Since 2005 , the availability of Doctor Who stories post-original transmission date has become vastly more extended than its twentieth-century counterpart . Through repeats , the Internet and regular DVD releases , the act of reviewing a story is so much more likely to happen within a comparatively short span of time , and thus the erosion of memory which tends to occur over the space of several years is now somewhat more avoidable . Still further , the technical look of an episode circa 2005 is far more likely to match up to visual expectations in 2011 , the distorting power of the pre-teen memory notwithstanding . <p> So , does this mean that the perception filter phenomenon is threatened with extinction , and that henceforth revisiting past adventures will not be quite so dislocating ? Indeed not , for however much a story may resist the colouring of an overactive imagination , there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generated by the viewing experience containing a wholly unadulterated recording of a scene or story . In this way , at least , the manner in which our perception of an event is preserved is still very much open to error . And in any case , there 's something to be said for enjoying ones perception-filtered memories , at least until the revisiting moment is upon us and we may glean just what we 've taken to heart and what we 've forgotten altogether and perhaps , when re-encountering an old favourite , these are the most telling details of all .

They are locked up alongside Barbara . <p> The Daleks summon the Doctor , and interrogate him . They explain they are survivors of a neutronic war with the Thals , inhabitants of the planet , which has caused mutations to both races . The Daleks are now confined to their travel machines and limited to the boundaries of their metallic city .

He is a striking , handsome , blonde man , named Alydon . His appearance proves his race , the Thals , have not suffered the same disfiguring mutations as the Daleks . Alydon is surprised to hear the Daleks are still alive . His race believes they were wiped out during the neutronic war .

The Daleks imply acceptance , asking in return that the Thals help them cultivate the land , but in reality they are plotting revenge and extermination of their old enemies . The message of peace is conveyed to the Thals , who are invited to collect food from the entrance hall to the Dalek city the following day . They believe this a genuine sign of friendship as Susan promised them that if the message was signed by her name it would be genuine . <p> Having recovered from the radiation sickness , the Doctors party stages an argument amongst themselves that breaks out into a fight .

Barbara states that even if this was possible , the Dalek appears to be able to see very well with his eyestalk , so it would be very hard to achieve . However , she devises a plan to use the dirt off of Susan 's shoes mixed with water to create mud . The next time a Dalek comes with their food , the captives jam the door , forcing the creature to return into the cell .

A young Thal named Dyoni provides a history of the planet Skaro from a Thal perspective for the Doctor . It seems that the Daleks were once known as Dals , humanoids similar to Thals . They mutated into their current forms following the neutronic war . The Thals have reacted to their history by adopting pacifism as a creed even though their history reveals them as warriors . Ian attempts to convince the Thals they 'll need to fight the Daleks to survive , but the Doctor suggests they leave . To everyone 's horror , they discover they ca n't .

Time Tales are Doctor Who dioramas ( picture stories ) , based on characters and worlds inspired by Doctor Who , and written and shot by Malcolm Orr . <p> It was bitterly cold in Little Winterton , and Harry Sullivan smiled to himself that the small village certainly earned its name . His first mental picture of the village was that of a snow covered village that one would see on a Christmas card , but that innocent image had been shattered when he had discovered that Little Winterton had a ghastly secret . There had been three missing persons from Little Winterton all over the last 7 months and Harry had decided to come and investigate . He had been on leave from UNIT and he found it hard to turn away from the thought of adventure , and harder still to sit on the side lines whilst he thought people might be in trouble .

Maybe it was cold in more ways than one . <p> The fall of night soon came , and it provided Harry with an opportunity to take a walk , with a dash of investigating on the side . Harry could see the flickering yellow lights inside the village meeting house and he had crept through the bushes to get a closer look . It was dark , and streetlights were scarce round here , so his approach was quite stealthy . He glanced through the windows to see what was going on inside . Lots of people were gathered inside , and all were swaying rhythmically to a folk song . Harry had images of The Wicker Man running through his mind and he suddenly felt a pang of danger at the back of his mind . It was familiar an outsider , a man of virtue , arrives in a local community , largely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them cold and unfriendly . He started regretting ever coming here he did n't  want to end up the same way as that poor Edward Woodward .

Fortunately there was n't all he could see behind him was a harmless scarecrow <p> The Doctor was pacing around the TARDIS . Robyn thought it was all rather comical the Doctor would walk round the console purposely , then stop , stare at a button for a few seconds , then backtrack to the other side and stare at a second button . By the time he had repeated this a few times , Robyn couldnt help but ask what he was doing . The Doctor said that the TARDIS had detected an unusual signal chronon waves , and specifically Gallifreyan ones . He wondered whether there was another TARDIS active on the vortex . Robyn remembered that when she met the Doctor she found that his people , the Time Lords , had the ability to travel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forcibly sealed off and the Doctor couldnt contact them , and all other TARDISes in the universe were scuttled by a Talons virus that has fixed them to a single point in space and time .

She knew her father was right when he said MOTs werent worth the paper they were written on it seems not getting the TARDIS MOTed had saved the Doctors life ( and she was sure hed forever use that as an excuse to never get it sorted ) . The Doctor had a wistful look that soon turned into a broad smile . It might just be possible , he dared to suppose , that Gallifrey has n't  been lost for good .

If the locals did n't  get him and kill him by burning him in a wicker effergy then he was sure the undercooked sausage would do it for them . What on Earth would dear Delia say ? Harry looked at the newspapers left out for guests to peruse . They were yellowing already , and Harry noticed the date was 9th July 1984 that was seven months ago the date before the first disappearance . It seemed to Harry that from that day onwards the village had n't  moved on . Stuck in a rut , or maybe even stuck in time <p> The TARDIS materialised with its usual wheezing-groaning noise , and its choice of location was no more promising on this occasion than it had been any time before .

Robyn soon reappeared and dumped K9 into the Doctors arms . The Doctor carried the robot dog to a nearby footpath out of the way of the mud and they headed towards a village that was signposted half a mile away . As they made their way towards the village they passed a scarecrow . The Doctor doffed his hat to the straw man , wondering if the straw man had a brain .

Harry had not heard him approach . The man had a lined face , with contrasting friendly and menacing features depending on how the light caught his features .

He warned Harry that this was not a place to come snooping , that the village was dangerous . The warning was interrupted by a loud Ahoy ! being shouted across the village square . Harry turned to see that the Doctor , a young pretty woman and a robot dog were making their way towards him . When Harry turned back around , Reverend Pallister was walking back through the graveyard back towards his church . <p> The Doctor was beaming he was pleased to see Harry again after such a long time . That was the trouble with Time Travel , Harry thought , because it had only been last month that Harry had met the Doctor during an android invasion plan had been foiled , but for the Doctor it had appeared that a lot had happened . His companion was from the 21st century apparently , and suddenly Harry felt a bit left behind . He wondered whether other companions of the Doctor would feel this way - almost as if when travelling with the Doctor on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ playground , but when you get off the merry-go-round time catches up with you once more . Harry explained to the Doctor and Robyn about the disappearances in the town and the apparent lack of enthusiasm to do anything about it . He mentioned that the vicar was rather sinister too slightly ominous . The Doctor felt a sudden wave of panic . They do n't  have a maypole too , do they ? he asked . <p> Nighttime was falling , and the event seemed to have energised the Doctor . He knew that the monsters came out at night , but it was the only way he would get answers . Something was seriously wrong here and the only lead that the Doctor had so far was Harrys bad feeling about the local vicar . The Doctor wrapped his scarf around his neck and went for a walk in the dusk , with K9 following him . Harry and Robyn watched them go , waiting until they were just out of view before immediately breaking the promise they had both sincerely made to the Doctor mere minutes ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a stone wall and peered into the woods just beyond it , taking the opportunity to adjust his hat . There was movement in the woods the Doctor could hear it . K9 reported very feint life signs , possibly humanoid . The Doctor asked him to clarify . K9 said that the life signs were only 43% human , but local radiation was causing his sensors some difficulty . The Doctor saw the gothic shadowy shape of the church about half a mile away and decided to head towards it . <p> Harry and Robyn approached the meeting house that Harry had talked about earlier . Once again the sound of jovial folk songs seeped from the building and Robyn could imagine the debauchery inside . She turned to face Harry . Its just like that film The Wicker Man. Harry nodded in agreement - he had felt just the same . You know , ' she continued , ' the one with Nicholas Cage and the bees in that American village. Harry rolled his eyes the Americans ruined everything <p> The Doctor had found a crypt on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ graveyard . Stone scrapings showed that the doors to the crypt had been opened recently , and there had been very little effort to disguise the fact . The Doctor opened the door to the crypt and saw a small drop to an area below . K9 scanned the area and said that there was a passage that led to an area just below the church . The Doctor asked K9 to stay on guard here whilst he went for a look . He dropped a few metres into the passageway and walked towards the basement underneath the church . A loud crack caused the Doctor to fall to the floor . Reverend Pallister was standing in the shadows behind him with a gold candlestick in one hand . At last , Pallister said to himself , we can begin. <p> A couple were about the leave the meeting house , so Harry and Robyn retreated behind a corner so they would not be seen . Robyn put her hand in something icky and turned to see what it was . She suppressed a scream as realised what it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ utter horror . It was a scarecrow , at least on the outside . The Hessian sack cloth that had formed its face had been torn open by the scarecrows twig hands to reveal a human skull underneath . Harry had the feeling that the mystery had been solved the missing people had n't  left Little Winterton , they had become scarecrows . Robyn looked up and saw some dark shapes standing only a hundred metres away there were three scarecrows looking at them and they started to move forward . Harry grabbed Robyns hand and they ran into the meeting house . <p> Harry pointed outside to the scarecrows and warned the villagers that they needed to bolt themselves in . The villagers looked panicked and helped Robyn and Harry to blockade the doors . There was no way anyone could get in to the meeting house now , the scarecrows were sealed outside . Harry asked them where the vicar was . Initially there was silence , but a man spoke up and said that they did n't  trust the vicar and they kept their distance from him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the vicar in seven months . Robyn looked worried she was almost certain that the Doctor would have gone to the church <p> The Doctor recovered consciousness and found that he had been tied to a pole in the basement area . Reverend Pallister was standing by an altar and reading from a book . Welcome Doctor , Pallister said . I have been expecting you. Pallister held the book up to the Doctor . It was already glowing , but the closer to the Doctor it got , the warmer the glow became . Do you know what this is ? asked Pallister . The Doctor did n't  recognise it . It was an ancient book , at least medieval if not older , and contained lots of sheets that had been added over the years . Pallister said it was called The Book of Descendants the Doctors descendants , in fact . Pallister explained <p> " Centuries ago there was a great battle . Vikings had invaded Britain in the north and their forces had reached a settlement that would be named by the victorious invaders as Jorvik @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brave Viking a tall man with a large nose and voluminous curly hair called Olafsson died in battle . After the battle his body was taken to a place of rest for fallen warriors . Overnight his body became encrusted with a white chalk and in the morning ithad faded and Olafsson was a new man - literally . It was n't long until he died again the man seemed to attract trouble but this time his body did not renew itself . There have been sporadic cases throughout history , and it became obvious that the people who were able to be reborn were partly alien , some even possessing two hearts . It was also noticed that an alien interfered in Earths affairs throughout its history and that the Book of Descendants would glow when that alien was close . The Book was held by Dr Bell in Renwick Asylum in the early part of this century and he met the alien The Doctor and retrieved a hair sample for the Book . And now you are here Doctor it seems the Book draws you to it like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his adventure where he discovered that key figures from Earths history had been taken out of time to an intergalactic party at The Happy Zodin as part of a bizarre social experiment . The experiment had been hijacked and Cyberhulks had been sent to wipe out the historical figures thus destroying Earth and its history . When the Doctor returned them back to Earth using a Time Scoop , he had been forced to use drops of his own blood to help the fluid conductors . K9 had warned that the people returned to their own times by the Time Scoop contained traces of the Doctors DNA , and now it appeared that many people throughout history continued to hold that DNA , some more than others . <p> Harry and Robyn listened as one of the villagers explained that there were local legends of the Scratchman who some thought was the Devil in human form . The legends said that the Scratchman raised an army from the Earth , twisted abominations of nature with arms made from dead twigs and blank soulless faces scarecrows . It seemed that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scarecrows and they were coming from Robyn and Harry they would become scarecrows just like the missing teenagers did . One of the boarded windows broke as a scarecrows arm smashed through it . Reverend Pallister is Scratchman , surmised Harry . No , the villagers said in chorus , We are Scratchman. <p> Pallister said that something had invaded his village and the villagers had become possessed . It appeared that he had been the only one not infected , and for some reason neither the villagers nor the scarecrow abominations they created could set foot on the churchs holy ground . He loosened the Doctors bindings , hoping that now he had heard the story that the Doctor would trust him . Pallister said that he had found something in the woods , something alien , and he wanted to show it to the Doctor . <p> Harry smashed a chair into a window as Robyn swung at the people closing in on her with a second . The window refused to break , so Harry grabbed Robyns hand and they ran up some stairs . Angry villagers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room and barricaded the door . When the door was smashed open a minute later , Harry and Robyn were gone and the window was wide open . <p> Harry and Robyn jumped from the roof to a small outside toilet and then dropped to the ground . Scarecrows were following them and the villagers poured out of the meeting house . Harry and Robyn ran towards the wood where they hoped they would be able to hide . <p> Pallister and the Doctor helped each other to lower K9 into the passageway under the graveyard . Pallister had shown the Doctor the alien item , and although the Doctor had a good idea what it was he had hoped that K9 would confirm . K9 analysed the item and concluded that it was a Nullifier part of a Gallifreyan weapon called the Blessing . The Blessing was a weapon that would be used to pacify a world by removing independent thought , replacing it with passivity . It has been hailed as the ultimate weapon of peace . If Gallifrey was threatened by an aggressive race of beings the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no threat level whatsoever . The Nullifier was the antidote a way of stopping the Blessing and restoring the minds of those affected by it , usually after they had been disarmed . The Nullifier seemed to be protecting the church somehow . The Doctor pocketed the Nullifier and asked Pallister to lead him to the woods where he found it . <p> Robyn and Harry ran through the woods , but if they had hoped that they would lose their pursuers they were wrong . The thickets and twigs that Harry and Robyn were fighting against seemed to almost move out of the way of the scarecrows following them , almost as if the wood itself was alive and very much on the side of the Scarecrows . <p> The Doctor and Pallister approached the woods and saw that the villagers were assembled outside . They seemed repelled as the Doctor approached them , probably by the Nullifier he thought . The Doctor asked where Harry and Robyn were . Hunted , came the reply . The Doctor ran into the woods with Pallister barely keeping up with him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up with him . Robyn stopped and turned back to help Harry , but she was surrounded too . Scarecrows grabbed her arms . She could feel the twig fingers digging into her . Small shoots started to grow from the fingertips and they crawled over her skin , scratching at the surface as if trying to break through . Suddenly the scarecrows howled in pain and withdrew . The Doctor and Pallister had arrived . The Doctor smiled as he picked up Harry and Robyn . Pallister led them to a stone effergy in the woods . The Doctor examined it it was the Blessing . He pulled the Nullifier out of his pocket and slotted it into the effergy . Both vanished in a haze of green light . The scarecrows that had been running away had dropped to the ground , no longer animated , and the villagers were asking each other why they were all outside the woods at this hour . <p> Inside the Little Oak Guesthouse the Doctor , Robyn , Harry and Pallister enjoyed a round of drinks . The Doctor explained that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had arrived here by accident . It had n't  fully discharged but had caused the villagers to form a group mind , based on local legends of the Scratchman , and allowed them some psychokinetic powers . Some of the teenagers had not been affected by the Blessing and the villagers had converted them into scarecrows . Pallister asked whether he should tell the villagers what happened , but the Doctor said that it was n't his decision . Pallister offered the Doctor the opportunity to take the Book of Descendants from his church . The Doctor said he would very much like to have it maybe it could help him put things right . <p> Robyn and K9 were inside the TARDIS where Harry had joined them . Do n't  let him touch anything , warned the Doctor . Last time we ended up facing giant insects. The Doctors face was grim . When he and Pallister had returned to the church the Book of Descendants had gone stolen . He would have to find out more about his descendants the hard way . Harry said he was going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the recent events . Harry had contacted UNIT and they were sending a post-invasion specialist team to help the community recover . Harry hugged Robyn , patted K9 and shook the Doctors hand . As Harry walked away from the TARDIS he could hear its wheezing-groaning sound , and he knew it would n't be the last time he would hear it . <p> Inside the church , Pallister had finished writing down the events of the adventure he had just had with the Doctor on a piece of paper . He carried it over to an alter and slipped it inside the Book of Descendants . He placed it into a small crate and sealed it shut . Now that Mrs Pinkerton had recovered and opened the post office again he could send the book on to his superiors for their analysis . Pallister attached a label to the crate with an address on it he was sending it to London for the attention of The Target Group.

@@109708932 @5108932/ <p> For over five decades , Doctor Who has been a staple of entertainment in homes all across the world .

Nintendo would be foolish not to bring this franchise under its wing ; doing so could bolster the success of both the IP and the video game company alike .

The episodes that did really grab me , though , were those written by Steven Moffat ( I know that sounds horribly crawly but it 's true ! ) When Steven took over the show and Matt , Karen and Arthur were cast , DW suddenly became everything I 'd hoped it could be and I was glued every Saturday night for the first season . <p> I do n't recall being particularly nervous about directing DW but I was acutely aware that , if I did a good job , there was a chance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ audience for years , just as " City of Death " has always stayed with me . <p> On the flipside of that , of course , was the constant nagging fear that I might screw it all up and be responsible for the most hated episodes in the show 's history ... <p> You 've worked on other high profile shows such as Spooks , Hustle , Hotel Babylon and New Tricks . How does Doctor Who compare , and how do you find adapting to directing for the Science Fiction genre ? <p> I was n't conscious of having to adapt to Doctor Who , perhaps because I 've always been such a huge sci-fi fan . If anything , I 've had to adapt more to some of the shows you mention above .

The look comes from the story ; there 's no way you could make this work if it looked like THX 1138 . <p> We referenced the James Whale " Frankenstein " along with Alien3 , Shutter Island , The Thing and a whole host of others . <p> It helped that most of this story was filmed on location in various castles in and around Cardiff .

Once prosthetic make-up is applied , it 's easy to shoot on over and over again and it bears greater close-up scrutiny than a lot of CGI work but if you look at a movie like Benjamin Button , there 's no way Brad Pitt could have been aged so convincingly with physical make-up . <p> Within these two episodes , we 've used a mix of make-up and CGI .

Well written , well acted and the BBC had actually put some money behind it , so it lived up to the hype . I did watch Doctor Who as a kid , though I was n't a massive fan , but I thought the new series last year was really impressive . " <p> So Peter , who celebrates his 33rd birthday in a couple of weeks , was taken aback when he got a phone call from Davies not long after , exploring whether he would be interested in a part in series two . <p> " I said yes , of course I would I mean how can you not be interested in the chance to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " But Russell did n't initially have me in mind as the baddie ; I was originally going to be the part of Elton , played by Marc Warren ( who stars in BBC 's Hustle ) .

" Really revolting . " <p> The story for Love &amp; Monsters is certainly unconventional for Doctor Who ; the Doctor hardly appears in it ! <p> Our hero is Elton , played by Marc Warren , a young man who has become fixated about finding out all he can about the mysterious stranger known as the Doctor who has randomly appeared throughout his life . <p> He forms a group with other people who have all , in one way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lives and are desperate to know exactly who he is .

No sooner have the Doctor and his companions left and Morton has seen this , then the Dalek time machine materialises . Morton takes the Daleks to also be props from the film and interacts with them very brazenly . He informs the Daleks that the other machine has just left . As he goes to take a photo again the Dalek time machine disappears . Eager to discover the mystery of the ' film set ' Morton looks for a trap door in the floor only to be discovered grovelling on the floor by a suspicious tour guide who hurries away to fetch a policeman . <p> In the TARDIS the Doctor is making allowances for what will happen if the Daleks were to catch up with them .

He accosts her and refuses to let her go . Luckily Vicki leaves the TARDIS and sees Barbara in distress . She sneaks up on the sailor and knocks him unconscious . By this time the Doctor has readied the TARDIS to carry on and Ian is sent to collect the girls . As Ian approaches , Barbara warns Vicki another sailor is coming . As Ian rounds the corner Vicki knocks him unconscious too .

It is the legendary Mary Celeste . <p> Back in the TARDIS the Doctor breaks the news to his companions that the gap between the TARDIS and the Dalek ship has lessened to eight minutes and that with every stop the Daleks get closer and closer to catching them . <p> Episode Four - ' Journey Into Terror ' <p> The TARDIS lands in a mysterious old house . Each traveller is scared by the creepy appearance of the house but tries to hide it from the others . The Doctor and Ian go upstairs to explore while Barbara and Vicki remain downstairs .

As they retreat , the Monster quietly returns to his slab . <p> A similar apparition appears to Barbara and Vicki downstairs also . As they are exploring , a vampire appears to them and introduces himself as Dracula before disappearing again . Barbara investigates the patch of wall that Dracula appeared from to find out how it might have been achieved , but when she turns back Vicki has disappeared . A woman from the upper balcony of the house screams at Barbara and as Barbara backs up in shock the wall rotates taking her with it . <p> Upstairs , the Doctor has rationalised where they have landed .

Ian asks whether this means that the Daleks can not chase them here , to which the Doctor agrees due to the fact that they are safe from time and space as they reside in the psyche . This gives them new hope , but as they return downstairs they find Barbara and Vicki have disappeared and are not in the TARDIS . They go back upstairs to look for them . <p> However the Doctor is wrong . The Daleks have zoned in on the Doctor 's whereabouts and are preperaring to materialise . They state that he is still on Earth and has just changed the year and the geographical location . The Daleks materialise in the house and a search party disembarks , but one remains in case they return . <p> The Doctor and Ian can not find Barbara and Vicki anywhere and , in their desperation , they go back into the room with Frankenstein 's Monster .

The travellers ' joy is short-lived when a Dalek corners them . When it looks like the travellers have no chances left Dracula reappears and distracts the Dalek that was about to kill them . The travellers run for the TARDIS , but Vicki is stopped as two other Daleks appear . As they do , Frankenstein 's Monster reappears and begins to destroy the Daleks .

Unsure of what to do and panicking she sneaks into the Daleks ' time machine . <p> In the TARDIS , the Doctor and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Daleks whilst they discuss the planet they have just been on .

It is only when Barbara joins them that they realise that Vicki has been left behind . <p> On the Dalek time machine , the Daleks further track the Doctor 's progress through time and space they state he is headed towards the planet Mechanus . Skaro is contacted for a report on Mechanus . It is also revealed that the Daleks have a secret plan . The Daleks have been building a machine that they refer to as a " reproducer " and they plan to " reproduce " the Doctor , claiming it will be finished by the time they get to Mechanus . As the Daleks disperse Vicki emerges from her hiding place . She tries to contact the TARDIS using some radio equipment that she discovers , but it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ works she sneaks up to it and is shocked when she sees what appears to be the Doctor standing inside the machine . <p> Back aboard the TARDIS , the Doctor is blaming himself for the disappearance of Vicki , but states that there is nothing that he can do about it due to the fact that the TARDIS can not interrupt its own timestream and visit the same place twice even if the time mechanism allowed them to pinpoint where they could go . Ian says they could fix the time mechanism but the Doctor says it could take months or years . Eventually Ian hatches a plan . If they were to seize the Daleks ' time machine , they could use that to return and rescue Vicki . The Doctor agrees and states that the next place they land will be the area of the inevitable battle that must take place . When they land they discover that they are on a largely swampy planet with dense undergrowth .

They soon discover that the dense undergrowth of the planet is made up of living plants called Fungoids that are constantly trying to attack them . They are soon cornered by the Fungoids and as it looks like they might finish off second some lights flash on which cause the Fungoids to vanish away . Ian investigates the lights and discovers they form a corridor through the jungle .

They soon reach the end of the corridor of lights and find themselves in a cave . Unsure as to why the complex system of lights leads to such an innocuous locale , they begin to look around , hoping they will either discover the significance of the cave or find a way of turning off the lights so as to allow the Fungoids to destroy the Daleks . In their exploration , they discover a weapon for keeping the Fungoids at bay . Barbara is confident that , with the combination of their newly-found weapon and the bomb that the Doctor has been working on , the Daleks are done for .

They leave to investigate it . They have not gone far when they spy some Daleks heading right for them . The travellers run back into the cave and suggest ways of escaping their certain doom .

He is an astronaut from Earth who crash-landed on the planet two years earlier , asking and has been kept as a prisoner by the Mechonoids . He explains to them that about fifty years ago humans began a process of colonising the planet and that the robots were originally devised to clear the area . However , Earth got caught up in an interplanetary war and the planet was forgotten . Ever since the crash , he has been held captive by the robots because he did not know the proper computer access codes that would identify him as one of the now never coming colonists ; they keep him in this room as a kind of experiment . <p> The Daleks have opened the lift door and received a report from Skaro on the Mechonoids .

He also shares an experience whereby he escaped once before and was nearly killed by the Fungoids ; he was soon recaptured by the Mechonoids and returned to his cell . Ian and the Doctor examine the roof and find a large drum with cabling wrapped round it , deciding that this could be used as a way of scaling the roof of the building . Steven states that he has tried this before , but was n't strong enough to pull the wire on his own , though it could work with all five of them .

One of the Daleks knocks the Doctor 's weapon , which explodes instantly , immobilising the two Daleks and setting the building on fire . <p> Atop the city , Ian and Steven are preparing the wire . However , Vicki is unsure as to whether she can do it due to her fear of heights . This phobia is so debilitating that at one point she faints . Much against her protests , she is blindfolded and tied to the wire whereby she is lowered down the side of the building . The smoke from the building begins to billow up out of the gap in the roof . Seeing this , Steven drops the wire in order to go back and save Hi-Fi . This causes Vicki @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wire . <p> Steven scales back down into the cell and begins to make his way through the building amidst a full out-and-out battle between the Daleks and the Mechonoids that seems fairly evenly pitted . <p> Outside , the four travellers have all made it down the side of the building . They are unsure as to what to do about Steven when the cable starts to burn , leaving Steven trapped . As they flee back to the TARDIS , the city is consumed by flames and collapses . Steven , however , has survived the city 's destruction and is stumbling around the forest , avoiding Fungoids and looking for the Doctor . <p> En route to the TARDIS , the companions and the Doctor stumble across the Dalek time machine . They are reticent to explore , but Ian lightens the mood by imitating a Dalek .

I wanted to be a film critic , but randomly applied for a job at ITV at the end of my post-graduate course in 2005 - and suddenly I was a junior researcher on a Channel 4 list-show - ' The 100 Greatest Family Films ' . As a massive film nerd , this was like going to heaven , as I got to meet a lot of my heroes , though Ray Harryhausen was my favourite - he brought one of the skeletons from Jason and the Argonauts to his interview ! After two years at ITV , I was offered a job as an Assistant Producer at Newcastle indie Dene Films , but within a few months I 'd wrangled it so I was producing and directing my own stuff , and I have n't really had chance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ranges from broadcast docos like Stammer School and The Last Cast for the BBC , and non-broadcast films for folks like Virgin Money and the NHS , but I 'd always been a huge Who fan and suddenly realised that I was in a position to work on Who professionally . I contacted Dan Hall in 2008 , and met up with him for a chat about where I could fit in , and he took a bit of a gamble on the spot - commissioning me to make the ' Time Zones ' historical doco for The War Games . I 'm currently working on my 34th doco for the Who range , so it 's been a busy 4 years ... <p> In the work you have completed for the Doctor Who DVD range so far , has there ever been anything that has shocked or surprised you ? <p> I think the most shocking side of this work is when a documentary contributor passes away . So many of the Who stories we cover have been from the 60s and 70s , and that sadly means that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We filmed on location with Barry Letts just a matter of weeks before he passed away - it was the last interview he ever gave , but he was still sharp as a tack . Nic Courtney was involved in the same shoot and again it 's shocking to hear sad news so soon after having met one of your heroes for the first time . Having said that , I 'm very proud that the range can include interviews with such a range of people who might never have had their memories recorded otherwise - it all adds up to an amazing tribute to the hard work and passion of everyone who was ever involved in Doctor Who . <p> What Special Feature that you have worked on to date are you most proud of and why ? <p> That 's a tricky one ... the first Who documentary I worked on that I was really proud of was our 4th film - ' Team Erato ' from The Creature from the Pit DVD .

After that , I loved working on the two ' Who Peter ' films , and that certainly felt like a gear change for the range in terms of production values - which I 'm very chuffed about . It 's always more fun when we get outside of the studio to film , so docos like ' Return to Little Hodcombe ' and ' Living with Levene ' from the upcoming Claws of Axos SE are always exciting , but maybe the one that 's found the most affection with fans is our ' Looking for Peter ' film for The Sensorites - which was a real pleasure to work on , and ended up being far more moving than any of us expected . <p> Is there a particular golden rule or trick to engaging with an audience from a directors point of view ? <p> I 'm always very keen on pace with the Who docos - I like the films to be nice and tight as an edit , and to be funny !

I 'm also very keen on pushing the formats where we can to shift things away from studio talking heads ( which can still be very effective of course ) into films like ' Looking for Peter ' which are far more out-and-about and really benefit from a great presenter like Toby Hadoke . <p> Finally , if you could have one round trip in the TARDIS , anywhere in time and space , where would you go and why ? <p> I 'd visit the set of Powell &amp; Pressburger 's ' A Matter of Life and Death ' - one of the days when they were filming on the massive stairway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's been my favourite film for years and I would geek out absolutely to meet Niv and The Archers.

The Doctor was busy flipping switches on a central control area , whilst K9 was reeling off a series of numbers . The Doctor noticed that Robyn had entered the TARDIS , but the way in which he casually dismissed his initial surprise suggested to Robyn that this sort of thing must happen to him all of the time . Robyn told the Doctor that she needed to find the source of the abductions and that her own father was abducted just like the Prime Minister was , and that she watched it happen . She continued stating that It had taken her two years just to figure out how to read his notes and use his scanning equipment to try and detect other abductions . The Doctor explained to her that the problem was much bigger than that someone somewhere has been removing people from throughout Earth 's history , so far up until the early 21st Century . Usually the people are abducted when they are on their own , but more recently the sampling has been less covert . However the TARDIS has now been able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ detect the source . The Doctor smiled at Robyn and offered her a jelly baby whilst they waited . <p> Robyn exited the TARDIS to find that the blue box had somehow materialised in a huge reception area . It was elegantly decorated and was packed full of people laughing , chatting and drinking . She looked around at the crowd of people and many of their faces seemed familiar . They were dressed in clothes from different periods in Earths history , but they were all mingling and socialising with each other . A man turned around just in front of her and Robyn recognised him instantly King Henry VIII . Henry smiled broadly and swaggered towards her , his gaze focused somewhere about a foot below her face . The Doctor managed to grab her by the arm and escorted her towards the bar , offering Old Henry a jelly baby by way of consolation and suggesting to Robyn that Henry had a thing for women , especially if he was n't married to them . The Doctor had found the drinks table and he poured them both a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gathering of faces , the more she could recognise . She could see that the Prime Minister did indeed make it here and had already found the food table , and then she noticed Amy Winehouse . She grinned shed have to get her autograph later ! <p> The Doctor was examining a control panel behind some foliage decorations whilst Robyn decided to get more drinks . She heard a familiar voice close by and ran towards it . Her father was standing there debating the theory of relativity with Albert Einstein himself . Professor Zak Brooks hugged his daughter and smiled he was pleased to see her . The Doctor soon walked over and shook Professor Brooks hand as Robyn introduced him . The Doctor explained that this place is an intergalactic club called The Happy Zodin and it was located on a small asteroid in the Novaris Cluster . Hed managed to find a layout of the club and he had located a control area nearby . Robyn was astounded they had just arrived in a club in the middle of space , crammed full of people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if it was an everyday occurrence . The Doctor smiled and reassured her that for him , it was . <p> The Doctor , Robyn and K9 managed to open a small panel that was hidden behind a huge portrait of Queen Elizabeth II . The Observation Office looked just as space-y as Robyn imagined it would all silver buttons and view screens , but there was an awful smell here . The Doctor explained that this was a control room . The Happy Zodin seemed to be a social experiment . Someone had been removing key people from history and putting them together to see how they would interact . A bit like Big Brother , Robyn noted . She asked why they were able to walk around as normal if they were on an asteroid , but the Doctor explained that the whole base was fitted with artificial gravity generators to simulate Earths gravity this whole project was created with very advanced technology . The Doctor looked at a monitor screen and stated that the nightclub seemed to have a Time Scoop equipment that could scoop people from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Last week they even had Elizabeth I , Joan of Arc and Elvis . The Doctor wondered where the person who controlled this experiment was . Robyns face was grim as she turned a chair around . The Doctor could see a sticky bloody corpse in the chair . Disintegration gun , diagnosed the Doctor . Suddenly the whole nightclub shook and the pleasant banter from the guests in the reception area turned to gasps and screams . <p> Robyn could see that her father was trying to calm down the crowd as they were panicking , but it was the presence of the Doctor striding purposefully through the midst of them that seemed to finally gain some sense of order . The whole structure was shaking , and the Doctor was feeling the ground , examining the harmonics of the tremors . K9 reported that the outer shell of the Happy Zodin was being attacked . The Doctor set off down a corridor , followed closely by Robyn , Einstein and a few others . <p> Robyn almost screamed when she saw them . They were huge creatures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faces were soulless , and their eyes vacant . Fortunately they were on the other side of the porthole the Doctor was looking out of . Cybermen , exclaimed The Doctor . The walls of the Happy Zodin were a metre thick , and it should hold them for a short while at least . The Doctor said that he needed to get the Time Scoop working fully and return the people back to where they came from before the Cybermen break through . If they were able to wipe out hundreds of key figures from human history Earth would be shattered and broken . <p> K9 scanned the reception room and located the Time Scoop underneath the central table . The Doctor and Robyn removed the table cloth to reveal the complex machinery underneath . The Doctor had his head buried deep inside a recess full of circuitry , and when he emerged , his face was grim . He told the gathered people that the Time Scoop was still functional , but that the energy levels stored in it were low it has just about enough juice for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the station were located through a tunnel in the core of the asteroid . The Doctor said that he would have to go down into the lower parts of the spacestation and get the power supplying the Time Scoop and the base defences back online . He said that someone had sabotaged the Happy Zodin and killed the controller - someone who was working as an agent of the Cybermen . K9 spun around and reported that the Cybermen had now weakened the outer wall . <p> The Doctor was shouting , holding his palm up and telling people to stop panicking . When they did , he smiled broadly . He told them that they needed to work together and fight against the Cybermen . They were some of the most important figures in Earths history , and unless they could stand together and protect history , the planet itself would be destroyed forever . Professor Brooks said the Doctors idea was fine except for one thing who on Earth could get all these different people armed and ready to fight against the Cybermen . The Doctor checked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to reach 20th Century Earth . A figure coalesced a metre in front of the Doctor , just beside the Time Scoop . Ladies and Gentlemen , the Doctor beamed . The greatest leader in human history Brigadier Alistair Gordon Lethbridge-Stewart. <p> The Doctor and Robyn started to climb down a service shaft into the lower levels of the Happy Zodin . The service tunnels were not as impressive as the reception area - they were dank and dusky and seemingly carved into the very rock of the asteroid . Robyn asked the Doctor who he thought was a Cyberman agent . The Doctor said he did n't  know , but he did have a plan , tapping his rather large nose as he spoke . The Doctor rubbed dust off a panel with his scarf to reveal the direction of the main power generators . <p> Albert Einstein and Professor Brooks lifted a small device onto a table where the professor started to examine it . Gravity ! exclaimed Einstein . The Brigadier looked closely and tried to hold in his frustration . It was like having two Doctors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already experienced that once before . Professor Brooks explained that the device was a gravity generator there were a few installed inside the floors to generate Earth type gravity levels . K9 concurred , adding that the devices emitted gravitons from internal nuclear generators . He said that the devices could be mounted onto security rifles from the Observation Office and used as graviton guns against the Cybermen . Henry VIII roared with delight and slapped the metal dog hard on his back . The talking chest speaks the words of war , and we shall be victorious ! he shouted . The Brigadier sprung into action , ordering the rifles to be quickly made . He ordered the rest of them to make weapons and shields from whatever they could find . They were going to fight back . K9s ears spun around as he warned the gathered crowd that the Cybermen were now inside the Happy Zodin and were approaching . <p> The Doctor had managed to find the power generators and was using his scarf to make some brief measurements before removing a panel to start work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too . And by a man , Robyn added , pointing to male footprints on the floor , Nothing but trouble. Possibly , the Doctor replied , unless its a shape changer. There was some clapping behind the Doctor and he removed his head from the generator and looked behind him . Amy Winehouse was pointing a disintegrator gun at them both . <p> The Brigadier looked at the gathered crowd , armed with graviton rifles and any weapons they could find to hand . The Cybermen were about to break through and he knew that he must not fail these people , the planet Earth , or even The Doctor , for that matter . Suddenly the Cybermen broke into the room . They were unlike anything hed ever seen before . They were massive robotic creatures , though he knew that somewhere deep inside those heavily armoured exteriors were the remains of beings that were once similar to humans . Hed remembered their invasion of London some years earlier , but these versions were very much different much bigger and far more powerful . King Henry ! Mr @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! King Henry VIII , one of Englands most fondly remembered monarchs , and Albert Einstein , one of the greatest intellects Earth had ever known , stood together and fired . The Cybermen shook violently as gravitons played within their steel armour , rattling and shaking them until the very metal splintered and scattered across the floor . There was a huge wave of cheering behind them at the sight of the Cybermen being destroyed . The Brigadier shouted for them to continue their preparations they were only the first two enemy combatants there could be more still . The Brigadier waved for his advance party to move forward . And somebody get Mr Richard to stop singing ! the Brigadier shouted to the crowd behind him . This is war , not a rainy day at Wimbledon. <p> The Doctor grinned broadly , his arms raised , as he manoeuvred himself in front of Robyn , protecting her from the line of fire . The Doctor said that he was n't sure who killed the controller of the Happy Zodin , but he knew that person would follow him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a force field around the killer . The Doctor put his arms down and explained that he had n't  been repairing the generator for the last minute or two , but creating a force shield trap as he knew theyd be followed . Amy slumped to the floor as a mist rose from her body and travelled through the force shield . The Doctor knew hed miscalculated the killer was a being able to possess people , not a shape changer after all . The mist enveloped Robyn , but it could not possess her . Robyn screamed and waved her hands in the air , but the mist retreated . The Doctor was again using the sonic on the generators station control panel and managed to adjust the force field to hold non-corporeal life . The mist screamed that the Doctor had cheated . It could not possess a body already possessed . The Doctor turned to look at Robyn she was shocked by what the creature had said . <p> More Cybermen advanced , determined to push back against the rebellious humans . K9 blasted one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ managed to complete another graviton gun and blasted another Cyberman as it advanced . But the tide was turning , and even the Brigadier realised that the battle they were taking on was a losing one . But The Brigadier knew that the man who had saved Earth time and again would not let him down this time . <p> The Doctor managed to finish the repairs on the sabotaged generators . He pressed some buttons on a panel and activated the power supply to the internal defences and the Time Scoop . The Doctor pulled a tin whistle from his pocket and blew hard . <p> K9s head raised and his ears whirred as he detected the signal the Doctor had sent . K9 trundled over to the Observation Office and interfaced with the main computer . The defences of the Happy Zodin sprung into life and energy beams smashed into the Cybermen , destroying them . The Brigadier smiled he had managed to hold off the Cybermen long enough , and although there were a few bruises , there were no casualties . <p> The Doctor had managed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he could take it to the Time Scoop . He explained to Robyn that it was a Thoughtform a being made from pure thought . They were an ancient race and existed in the deep realms of Lost Space . They had n't  been detected for millennia in the Milky Way galaxy . The Brigadier interrupted the Doctors rambling to ask him how they would all get home . The Doctors eyes almost seemed to pop out of his head as he sprang towards the Time Scoop . K9 reported that the scoop was not functional as a Cyberman weapon had cracked the container holding the chronon fluid . The Doctor grabbed a badge from his pockets and nicked his finger . A small drop of blood welled . The Doctor dropped it into the chronon fluid container and said there would be enough chronons in there from his centuries of time travel to keep the scoop working long enough to get everyone home . After that , he was going to permanently disable it . The Time Lords did n't  approve of Time Scoops he was slightly nervous about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trapped in one . <p> The Brigadier shook the Doctors hand . It had been great to see him again and he was sure theyd meet again soon . He stood next to King Henry VIII they were the last two to leave , except for Robyn and her father . Henry slapped the Brigadier on his back and praised his leadership skills , musing that with a general like him , England would defeat the whole of Europe combined . The Brigadiers rather bemused expression faded as they were returned to their own times . Robyn asked the Doctor whether any of them would remember their time with the Doctor . The Doctor replied that the time scoop erased memories when returning people that 's the only way this experiment could ever succeed without changing history . They were all returned to their time zones just as they were the very second they had been abducted . K9 had a correction the Doctors blood had acted as a conductor in the time scoop as planned , but there had been an unintended side effect every single person returned to history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own DNA . <p> The TARDIS arrived back in Winchester Street . Professor Brooks shook the Doctors hand and thanked him for saving them all . The Doctor turned to say goodbye to Robyn , but she put her arm around K9 and asked whether she could maybe see a few more places first . The Doctor turned to Professor Brooks , but he replied that he had learned long ago when he could n't change her mind . Robyn kissed her dad and promised that she would return to see him again soon . Professor Brooks left and the Doctor and Robyn watched as he walked down Winchester Street and out of view . The Doctor wondered whether Robyn wanted to see something of the past , and Robyn smiled . Sure , she replied . <p> The TARDIS faded from view with a familiar wheezing-groaning sound , off to adventures new .

@@109708978 @5108978/ <p> It remains the biggest sin the BBC has ever committed . Reams of tape , hours upon hours of vintage , innovative programming , burnt like a Guy Fawkes effigy and turned to ashes . Unwanted by those who owned them , loved by those who watched them . <p> A screengrab of the Doctor Who title sequence from the Hartnell Era . <p> Hundreds of shows that should have been treated with all the care and attention that went into making them in the first place , wiped . Never to be seen again . <p> How the BBC and its cousin stations ever got away with it we will never know . So many classics , gone . Dad 's Army , Hancock , Not Only But Also , The Likely Lads , Top Of The Pops , shows which changed the television landscape and influenced generations . Then there is the granddaddy of them all , our favorite show , Doctor Who . Thanks to the shortsightedness of bosses and normal everyday people doing what they were told , 106 episodes from the shows infancy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this all know the story , but let me refresh your memory . Up until 1972 the BBC held every single episode of Doctor Who made up to that point in its archives ( All except The Daleks Master Plan installment The Feast of Steven ) all of which were 16mm tele-recordings made for commercial sale to foreign networks . The original episodes had been stored on videotape yet since video was at this time a very expensive commodity ; the shows were transferred to film so the original tape could be used again on future recordings . Both the BBC and ITV were storing their shows in this way . What happened between 1972 and 1978 , however , is nothing short of a tragedy . <p> BBC Enterprises , thinking that nobody wanted these episodes and that other copies had been made and sold the countries who wanted them , or kept at the BBC Film Library , started systematically destroying the prints . Other factors including copyright problems and wrangling 's with Equity also contributed to the films fate . Even the need for space for other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a facility to store them in was a key factor in their demise . These black and white gems were also seen as redundant with the introduction of colour TV and with no outlet from repeats or a commercial market to profit from ( pre VHS and DVD times ) there fate was sealed . <p> It was n't until 1978 when the BBC began to catalogue what it had in the archive that the junking stopped . The intervention of super-fan Ian Levine ( who saved the very first Dalek story among many others ) and the efforts of Sue Malden means that today there are far more episodes of Doctor Who in existence than there would have been . Between 1963 and 1969 the BBC recorded 253 episodes of Doctor Who and before the intervention and recoveries ; fewer than 50 were known to exist within the BBC . Within a few years and following enquiries to other stations plus the British Film Institute , who returned three complete Patrick Troughton stories , that figure had doubled . <p> A previously missing Doctor Who film reel from ' The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Already , Doctor Who was in a better state than other shows . Many editions of Z-Cars- nearly 500 episodes gone - United ! and Not Only But Also were completely missing . Although most of the latter would eventually be recovered , the former no longer exists . <p> Throughout the 1980s episodes began to turn up in the unlikeliest of places . Two episodes of the classic ; The Daleks Master Plan were found in a church basement . A film collector bought The Evil of the Daleks ; Episode 2 and The Faceless Ones , Episode 3 at a car boot sale while The Wheel in Space ; Episode 3 was also found by a film buff . <p> Those discoveries lead to the prediction that engineers and workers , horrified by what they were being asked to destroy , literally stole the prints , saving them from a fiery end . Some fell into the hands of film collectors who did not know , and possibly still do n't  know , the rarity of their collections . <p> As time went on more episodes returned from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1984 and a few years later four episodes from The Ice Warriors were found in a cupboard in Villiers House , which the BBC was in the process of moving out of . One was even in the wrong can and one that should have contained Episode 6 of Fury From The Deep had something completely different in it all together . Who knows , perhaps more episodes exist to this day in unmarked or misleading cans . <p> Publicity still from ' The Tomb of the Cybermen ' ( 1967 ) . <p> By the end of the eighties the recovery of lost Who episodes began to dry up . It seemed as if the well had truly gone dry until all four episodes of Patrick Troughtons The Tomb of the Cybermen , were returned from a television station in Hong Kong in 1992 . Fans were understandably elated with the news since it was thought of as one of the all time great stories , and even though some were disappointed by its production values its reputation remains on the whole untarnished and it is still to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exist . <p> In 1996 Australian fan turned researcher Damian Shanaman discovered clips from missing episodes in the Australian archives which were cut because they were considered too disturbing for younger viewers . This enabled some clips to be edited back together with episodes held in the Film Library to make them complete again . 8mm recordings made by fans were also found , who obtained them by pointing a camera at the TV monitor as the show was originally broadcast . <p> Just 3 years later a film collector in New Zealand returned the first installment of The Crusade ( The Lion ) . The film was rather scratched but its discovery meant that there are now currently only 2 episodes from the entire second season of Doctor Who still missing ; ironically both are from the same story . Further clips were also found in New Zealand in 2002 . These were also censor clips and then a year later a reel found at BBCs Windmill Road archive led to the discovery of cutting room floor footage from Fury From The Deep and rather more intriguing a trailer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Daleks . Then eagle eyed viewers noticed footage from this story in a Tomorrow 's World programme in 2005 . These findings were almost as unexpected as the print of the pilot episode turning up 20 years previously . <p> Almost five years after the return of The Lion a former BBC employer announced that he rescued Day of Armageddon , the second part of The Daleks Master Plan in the seventies when he found it a room of films to be junked at Ealing Film Studios . Luckily he had kept in very good shape , which now left only nine episodes missing from the epic . <p> Episode title screengrab from the rediscovered ' Galaxy Four ' ( 1965 ) . <p> By 2011 , 108 episodes were sill missing .

Happy Days ! <p> What makes these discoveries all the more amazing is that the footage is now nearly 50 years old and the other the earliest surviving Troughton episode . The episodes have been shown at the BFI Missing Believed Wiped event earlier that day and the fact that these episodes will soon be seen again by a new generation of fans is equally exciting .

Doctor Who is blessed with an advantage over all the other shows that were wiped . Thanks to the dedication and hard work of fans , every single episode from the 1960s does exist in audio form , recorded on tape recorders pointed at the television . These recordings have been painstakingly restored and released for commercial sale adding another quality to the show . As audio plays , the missing episodes are just as terrifying as when they originally went out and they encourage the listener to use their imagination and paint the pictures in your head . <p> Missing Doctor Who ReAnimated for ' The Invasion ' DVD release ( 2006 ) . <p> Some fans have even gone as far as reconstructing the missing stories through various means .

In 2006 Cosgrove Hall , the company responsible for childrens programmes like Dangermouse and Postman Pat animated the two missing parts of the 1968 story , The Invasion , which was then released with the other remaining parts . With the story now complete , 2entertain have also commissioned Big Finish Productions and Theta Sigma to animate the two lost parts of The Reign of Terror . Those episodes were nearly saved , but the facility that held the only remaining copies in Sierra Leone was destroyed during civil unrest in 1974 . Whether or not these reconstructions have been inspired by the fan remakes online , they are still one step further to the BBC having a full archive of Doctor Who again . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that only the first two Doctors were affected by episode wiping . When the archives were audited for the first time in 1978 it was discovered that the videotapes containing early Jon Pertwee seasons had also been destroyed . In fact , all of Pertwees seasons had at least one story that was incomplete . However , these stories had been recorded onto 16mm film and although this now meant that the original colour copies did n't  exist it does mean that all of the episodes broadcast in the 1970s onwards are complete , a luxury which deserted The Goodies and other shows . Also , since the stories had been broadcast in colour at home and abroad , colour tapes from countries such as America were returned and are used as a guide when colourizing the black and white footage for DVD releases . <p> There have been many ' so near , yet , so far moments ' along the way when episodes were junked , just before they were saved at the BBC . The Wheel in Space ; Episode 5 , The Power of the Daleks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and The Celestial Toymaker ; Episode 2 were fated to junking as were all four parts of Galaxy Four ( or so we thought ) and the fourth part of The Daleks Master Plan , The Traitors was never returned after being loaned to Blue Peter and not the final part of The Tenth Planet as the fan myth goes . <p> Of all the episodes no longer in existence the one that is most sorely missed is that final part of Hartnells last story . It is also the only story to be just one episode away from completion . Episode 4 of The Tenth Planet , which shows the Doctor regenerate for the first time , and only represented by a clip and a few poor quality 8mm film trims , is on the BBCs top ten most-wanted list of missing footage which includes the corporations footage of the moon landing . <p> A surviving still from the lost fourth episode of ' The Tenth Planet ' ( 1966 ) . <p> There was , of course , that incident when a Mr. Roger Barrett ( the real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had the episode on videotape and ended up conning the BBC and Doctor Who fandom when this turned out to be a hoax . Its whereabouts remains a mystery to this day . But one day it will come back , yes , one day ... <p> The most disturbing factor in the junking is its sporadic nature . Seasons 1 , 2 and 6 are incredibly well represented , with The Space Pirates being the only story from season six to be represented by an orphaned part . The reason behind the lack of episodes from Seasons 3 , 4 and 5 ( especially Troughtons first two seasons ) is that there were less television stations around the world who purchased them . In fact , only seven Troughton episodes exist from Season Four and The Tomb of the Cybermen is the only complete story from his first two years in the role . <p> Even stories involving the eternally popular Daleks ( The Dalek 's Master Plan , The Power of the Daleks and The Evil of the Daleks ) were destroyed and Season Five , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best in the entire series , remains decimated . <p> So , what does the future hold in our quest ? These latest findings have given an injection of hope to Who fans everywhere , that more will turn up , its just down to a lot of hard work and luck and getting in touch with the right people . Richard Molesworths brilliant book ; Wiped ! Doctor Whos Missing Episodes , has shed new light on where the films were originally sold and which ones are likely to turn up . Furthermore , the discovery of footage belonging to other shows may also encourage film collectors and TV stations to look through they 're collections again . A former BBC cameraman returned footage of a long lost David Bowie performance on Top Of The Pops the same week it was announced that Galaxy Four and The Underwater Menace had been returned . A couple of years ago , a man purchased a World War One propaganda film made by Charlie Chaplin over 90 years ago , previously from eBay for just over three quid ! So you never know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after our lifetime . <p> In my own personal view I think it is an impossible dream that the BBC archives will have a full quota of Doctor Who episodes again . Having said that , I , like many other fans , still believe that more episodes are out there . I do think that one day ; there will be below 100 episodes missing but not many more after that . Time has passed since their original broadcast and junking and if episodes are sitting in attics , garden sheds or cupboards , the condition will only keep deteriorating as time goes by . Maybe one of the many prints made of Marco Polo is in a far-flung country ? Maybe the two lost episodes from The Ice Warriors are in a loft somewhere ? For all we know The Tenth Planet ; Episode 4 could still be sitting in an unmarked can somewhere in London ! <p> So , I implore you dear reader , let 's keep the good work going .

The hand of a mysterious Monk is at work in the nearby monastery , intending that history takes a different course . <p> Episode One - ' The Watcher ' <p> A bored Vicki is moping around the TARDIS , clearly missing the company of Ian and Barbara . The Doctor offers to take Vicki back home if she is so unhappy , given he never really gave her much of a choice when they left Dido . This conversation is interrupted by a sound coming from the TARDIS ' living quarters . Convinced it is a Dalek , the Doctor and Vicki prepare themselves for an attack . However , instead of a Dalek , a human form is revealed to the travellers - Steven Taylor , who collapses to the ground . <p> As he is discovered , the TARDIS materialises on a rocky shore line .

Steven explains that as the Mechonoid City collapsed , he escaped from the rubble and looked for the Doctor . He luckily found his space ship and collapsed in it before the Doctor and his companions left the planet . As Steven starts to feel more normal Vicki begins to explain that the TARDIS is a time machine - Steven is far from convinced and brands the TARDIS an IDBI - I Do n't Believe It . The Doctor asks Steven to put his doubts to one side and suggests that Vicki show Steven where to get washed and changed so they may go and explore . <p> In the outside world two humans , dressed in tunics and living in primitive , tent-like structures , are interrupted when another of their party comes to inform them that a box has landed on the beach - thinking it washed up from a ship wreck . The two men go to explore it . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Vicki discovers a Viking helmet that the Doctor dates to the tenth or eleventh century . He suspects this is where they have found themselves . Steven remains sceptical saying that the helmet may have been left there as the plaything of a child . The Doctor and his friends decide to go exploring . The Doctor goes off alone , leaving Vicki and Steven to make their own way . As the travellers go along , the Monk sneaks from behind a rock and inspects the outside of the TARDIS , trying the door before moving on . He makes his way up the cliff and towards a monastery . Contemplatively , he enters and locks the door behind him . Soon singing starts . <p> The two men who have gone to look for the TARDIS are disappointed to discover the ship is no longer there due to the high tide . They speculate that the waves have dashed the ship against the rocks . <p> Later on that day , the Doctor is exploring the area . He stumbles across the homestead of the couple who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around , looking for clues of the time he has landed in , he turns to have a stick pushed against his throat , forcing him to be still . The stick belongs to the wife of the house . She apologises for her rough behaviour , saying that you ca n't be too careful with strangers . She soon becomes very hospitable , offering the Doctor mead and chatting with him . From their conversation , the Doctor learns it is the summer of 1066 , just before the Viking invasion that preceded the Battle of Hastings . Whilst the woman is fetching more mead the singing , which has continued throughout the conversation , distorts and warps as if it is created by an inhuman voice . The Doctor cross-examines the woman , guessing that the monastery has only just come back into use and no one has seen any of the monks . With this information he goes to explore the mysterious building . <p> Elsewhere , Steven and Vicki are interrupted in their explorations by another figure . They hide in the undergrowth , waiting for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to inspect something very closely . Worried that it might be something of theirs , Steven confronts the man , which ends in a scuffle . Steven is hit and the man escapes . Steven has got what the man was looking at . It is a modern-day watch . <p> By this time the Doctor has found his way to the monastery . Little does he know he is expected by the monk who unlocks the door for him . The Doctor moves through the building , following the singing . Finally he finds the source of the noise - a gramophone attached to a large amplifying device . The Doctor stops the record , but before he goes any further , bars crash down , trapping him in the room . The monk makes his way towards the Doctor , laughing manically . <p> Episode Two - ' The Meddling Monk ' <p> The Monk makes the Doctor breakfast with his toaster and electric griddle .

He goes off to wait on the cliffside . Soon , he sees a Viking longboat loom over the horizon , which delights him . <p> When Steven and Vicki are taken to the Saxon village , an argument breaks out between the two men . They are Wulnoth and Eldred . Wulnoth is the headman of the village and wants to let the travellers go , whilst Eldred is convinced they are spies for the Vikings and should be kept .

The two men make their way into the wilderness . <p> Steven and Vicki have arrived at the monastery , only to be told by the Monk that he has seen no one out of the ordinary for the last few days . Steven presses him to go in and ask the other monks . While he is gone , Vicki and Steven become convinced the Monk is lying to them . They devise a plan to see if he really has n't seen the Doctor .

When Wulnoth and Eldred return , they find her body . Eldred immediately suspects Steven and Vicki , but Edith struggles to say it was Vikings . Wulnoth and his men follow the Vikings ' tracks and soon catch up with them . This leads to a mighty battle in which Eldred is wounded and Gunnar is killed . The two men make their way to the monastery for sanctuary . <p> While this is happening , Steven and Vicki break into the monastery and look for the Doctor .

They decide the Doctor has used it and elect to follow it . As they leave the cell , the Monk comes to check on the Doctor , only to find the door open and the secret passage breached . Before he has any time to explore further , he is called to the aid of the two Saxons . <p> After his escape , the Doctor has found his way back to the Saxon village and the company of Edith .

They decide to go back to the TARDIS , hoping he has done likewise . <p> At the monastery the Monk uses his knowledge of modern medicine to nurse Eldred back to health . Wulnoth insists that Eldred stay with the Monk until he is well . Reluctant to blow his cover , the Monk consents . In conversation with Eldred the Monk learns that from the looks of the Vikings the Saxons encountered , a full invasion may occur within three days .

He is interrupted in his scheming by frantic knocking at the door . The Monk answers it only to find no one . As soon as the door is closed , the knocking resumes . Bemused , he goes out to explore , only to be met by the Doctor . The Doctor points a stick in the Monk 's back , saying it is a rifle and he has come for answers .

To avoid the Monk using the Doctor 's more modern dress as a way of turning the visitors against him , he demands the Monk give him a spare Monk 's cassock before they answer the door .

He then slips out of the monastery to visit the Saxon village . There he speaks to Wulnoth and informs him he is expecting a boat to arrive shortly with provisions for the monastery . He asks the village 's support in setting the fires on the cliff and keeping them lit . Wulnoth agrees , but when the Monk leaves Edith and he say it may have to do with the Viking invasion of which the Doctor spoke . <p> Back at the monastery , Sven looks into the Doctor 's cell and sees the door to the secret passage open .
