@@4164412 @qwx36376 @qwx36374 @qwx36378 @qwx36377 <h> Primary circuit in PWRs <p> Pressurized water reactors ( PWR ) are generally designed with a third water circuit in addition to the two found in other thermal power plants ( e.g. , boiling water reactors ( BWRs ) or coal-fired and geothermal power plants ) . In this so-called primary circuit , the water absorbs the heat generated by nuclear fission and transfers it to the secondary circuit . This additional circuit ensures that radioactive materials remain contained in it and do not disperse to the secondary circuit and therefore potentially to the environment . <p> This additional water circuit entails some specific requirements regarding chemical analysis and monitoring . <h> Determining boric acid <p> The water in the primary circuit of PWRs contains dissolved boric acid . The purpose of the boric acid , and of the 10B isotope in particular , is to act as a moderator : The boric acid captures the fission neutrons , which keep the nuclear chain reaction going and are responsible for the reactivity of the reactor . Since its concentration plays such an important role , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extremely important in view of reactor safety and efficiency . <h> in the lab <p> Boric acid , being a weak acid with an acidity constant of Ka1 5.75+10-10 , is difficult to titrate . To enable easy titration , polyalcohols , e.g. , mannitol , need to be added to the boric acid , leading to the formation of complexes with a greater acidic strength that behave like a monovalent acid which can be titrated with a NaOH solution . <p> If boric acid is to be titrated manually , this complexation involves a great deal of work and requires exact pipetting of the sample , distilled water , and mannitol solution in order to yield accurate results . Automated titration is therefore certainly the better choice . <h> and in the process <p> The fuel assemblies can not be exchanged during operation in PWRs . This makes it necessary to have a fuel reserve in place at the start of an operating cycle . The excess activity in the reactor associated with this reserve fuel is controlled by adjusting the boric acid concentration in the reactor . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be lowered to keep the reactor running . Setting the correct boric acid concentration in the primary circuit is therefore crucial for safe and efficient operation of a PWR . <p> This can be achieved by closely monitoring the boric acid concentration . The Metrohm Process Analytics ADI 2016 and ADI 2045TI Analyzers enable you to determine the boric acid concentration quasi-continuously by way of potentiometric titration . <h> Determining lithium <p> The boric acid that is added to the primary circuit of the PWR lowers the pH value and thus increases the corrosion potential . To counteract this effect , an alkalizing agent , in most cases monoisotopic lithium hydroxide ( 7Li ) , is added to the primary circuit . The lithium concentration therefore also has to be monitored . This can be done with ion chromatography in conjunction with intelligent partial loop injection ( MiPT ) . <h> Determining metal cations in the primary circuit <p> Some metal cations have to be monitored in the primary circuit of a PWR as well . Nickel is an important alloying metal that increases the corrosion resistance of steel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promotes corrosion , making regular checks of the nickel concentration necessary . <p> Depleted zinc is often added to reduce the radioactivity on component surfaces and to reduce corrosion of metal surfaces . This cation , too , has to be monitored regularly . <p> These cations can also be determined down to the sub--g/L range using ion chromatography . Because of the presence of boric acid and lithium hydroxide , the determination of these cations requires combined Inline Preconcentration and Matrix Elimination . <h> Process Analytics Applications <p> We have compiled 40 years of our experience in process analysis control into one handbook .

Arguably , photovoltaic cells will play a starring role in our energy shift to a carbon-free future . <p> At Metrohm , we want to contribute our part to minimizing our carbon footprint and preserving the environment and natural resources for future generations . <p> In 2016 , we have reached a major milestone on this ambitious journey : the solar panels on the roof of our Headquarters in Herisau , Switzerland , will now cover 25% of our energy demand . <p> The etching solutions consist of various acids , stabilizers , wetting agents , or buffers and determine the surface structure and thus the efficiency of the solar cells . Etching continuously increases the amount of dissolved silicon , which influences surface morphology and the etch rates . The composition of the texturing bath is the key for producing efficient solar cells . In the most hostile environments , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... <h> thermometric titration <p> Etch acid mixtures containing HNO3 , HF , and H2SiF6 from the etching of silicon substrates can be analyzed in two determinations . The first determination involves a direct titration with NaOH , followed by a back titration with HCl : this determination yields the H2SiF6 content plus a value for the combined contents of nitric and fluoric acid . The second determination consists of a titration with aluminum to determine the HF content . On the basis of these two determinations , the software calculates the individual results for HNO3 , HF , and H2SiF6. <h> potentiometric titration and direct measurement <p> The total silicon content in the texturing baths can also be determined by potentiometric titration . The determination of total and single acid concentration and of dissolved silicon was carried out using aqueous acid-base titration with NaOH solution . <p> The Solitrode HF is the appropriate pH glass sensor for potentiometric titration . It has an extraordinary resistance in HF-containing texturing baths . <p> Alternatively , the total fluoride concentration can be determined with Metrohm 's fluoride-selective electrode ( F-ISE ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bound in hexafluorosilicate provides the hydrofluoric acid content . The content of nitric acid can be calculated from the total acid content . <h> ion chromatography with dual detection <p> Fluoride , nitrate , sulfate , and acetate are determined by conductivity detection after chemical suppression , while the silicon present in the form of hexafluorosilicate is detected spectrophotometrically as molybdosilicic acid after derivatization in the same analysis . <h> Thin film solar cells : Electrolyte analysis with voltammetry <p> Thin film " or second-generation " solar cells are produced by depositing extremely thin layers of photosensitive materials on various low-cost substrates such as plastic or glass . The idea is anything but new : Already in the 1980s , amorphous silicon ( a-Si ) solar cells powered our pocket calculators and watches . The low efficiency rate of a-Si is more than compensated by the ease of manufacture , the low costs , and the thermal resistance required during operation in hot climate zones . <p> Very promising are the two other mainstream PV thin film technologies with the absorber layers of copper indium gallium diselenide ( CIGS ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the way forward , and electrodeposition is an extremely economical and convenient way to produce solar cells . Voltammetry allows you to analyze the main constituents of electroplating baths and additives with high sensitivity : <p> Excellent light absorption is achieved with thin layers of copper indium diselenide ( CIS ) interfaced with the semiconductor cadmium sulfide ( CdS ) to produce an effective heterojunction . The latter is deposited in a wet chemical process using cadmium acetate and thiourea , the source for in situ sulfide generation . First , Cd2+ is adsorbed on the surface . Subsequently , the sulfide released during the decomposition of thiourea reacts with the adsorbed Cd2+ ions . Cadmium and thiourea concentrations in the bath are precisely controlled using voltammetry . <p> And there is more : Apart from the CdS heterojunction , voltammetry can be used to determine the concentrations of the metal solutions and additives in the electroplating baths that are used for the electrodeposition of the CIS layer on molybdenum . <p> By substituting some gallium for indium , copper indium gallium selenide ( CIGS ) solar cells are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . CIGS cells are the most important thin film solar cells , consisting of a thin layer of cadmium sulfide ( CdS ) that forms the p-n heterojunction with the thicker CIGS absorber Cu(InGa)Se2 . <p> Cu(InGa)Se2 thin films are prepared by one-step electrodeposition from low-concentrated metal salt solutions onto molybdenum . Indium , selenium , and copper in the electrolytes are determined by polarography at the dropping mercury electrode ( DME ) . For gallium analysis , anodic stripping at the hanging mercury drop electrode ( HMDE ) is used . As already mentioned in the CIS chapter , voltammetry also controls the Cd and thiourea content for CdS deposition . <h> Further applications and products <h> Optimizing coating parameters with ProcessLab <p> It does n't matter what process step in the texturing process of crystalline silicon has to be monitored " etching , washing , rinsing , or hydrophilization " , the standard parameters pH value and conductivity are crucial for the surface morphology and always have to be monitored . The customized ProcessLab analyzer will do this for you , even in the most hostile HF environments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ monitor all alkaline and acid texturing , washing , and cleaning steps , rinsing as well as hydrophilization . <h> Surfactant titration in texturing baths <p> Silicon solar cells require a textured front surface to reduce energy losses due to reflection . Surfactants in the texturing bath ( e.g. , sodium dodecyl sulfate or cetyl trimethyl ammonium bromide ) have a strong influence on surface morphology and coating thickness , which is why their concentration has to be strictly controlled . Metrohm offers several potentiometric determination methods for anionic and cationic surfactants . <h> Front end bath control with NIR spectroscopy <p> The wet chemical process step for alkaline texturing of the wafer surface is crucial . NIRS spectroscopy allows real-time monitoring of bath concentrations of , e.g. , hydroxide , silicate , and 2-propanol . The method is very reliable and fast and requires no consumables .

This method involves errors because sodium is not only present with chloride as the counterion . A new method for direct titration of sodium with thermometric endpoint detection solves this problem . <p> Thermometric titration shares with potentiometric titration the use of a sensor to detect the endpoint of the titration reaction . In the case of thermometric titration , however , the sensor is a fast responding thermometer . Hence , instead of measuring the electrochemical potential in the solution , this robust , highly sensitive thermometer tracks the reaction enthalpy , i.e. , the temperature change in the solution . <p> The endpoint of the titration is marked precisely by the moment , when the reaction stops and no significant temperature change is registered any longer in the solution . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to find the endpoint , there is no need to calibrate the sensor . Sensor maintenance is minimal , and it can be stored dry between titrations . <p> As for sample preparation , users only need to ensure that the matrix does not prevent the analyte from reacting with the titrant and that the sample is sufficiently mobile . Accurate results are available in less than 2 minutes . <p> Metrohm provides the 859 Titrotherm with tiamo software for thermometric titrations , a total solution that can easily be automated by integrating an autosampler . Thermometric titration and its application to food samples is described in detail in a Metrohm whitepaper.
