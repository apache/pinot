By looking at the sight gauge on the tank you can determine the type of oil stored - Kerosene28 is yellow and Gas Oil is red . If you do n't have a sight gauge you should confirm this with either the previous owner or the service technician ( they often leave a contact sticker on the boiler ) . ( For the technically minded ) Road/rail transport information for Kero28 is : UN No 1223 Proper shipping name KEROSINEADR/RID Class/Packing group 3 / III Hazard identification No 30 CEFICTremcard No 30S1223 UK Emergency action code 3Y <p> And is it legal to use it in a tractor that only moves on private land ? Gas Oil is Red Diesel . You are allowed to use it in tractors and any other vehicles used on private land , including a car or truck . There is also a law that says you can use the tractor on a public road within a 7 mile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kerosene in selected areas . To find out if we offer Premium Heating Oil in your area , please get a free quote , selecting the premium option ( if available ) . We also offer a range of additives for AGA 's and Oil Boilers , visit our online shop to read about the benefits of using our Premium Heating Oil Additives ( CookerMax for AGA 's and Rayburns / BoilerMax for Oil fired Boilers ) . <p> The minimum order ( excluding Northern Ireland ) is 500 litres . A lot of our Suppliers will only accept orders in multiples of 100 litres so we recommend that you place your order accordingly . If the Supplier can not put an order on the system for amounts in between they will round your order down to the nearest 100 litres and you will be refunded the difference . <p> The easiest way to obtain a quote is to do it on our website . The price of oil can change at any time so the price you actually pay will be the price you are quoted when you place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from BoilerJuice over the phone or by email . <p> Because you are paying for your oil when you place the order we have to charge you for a specific volume . We are not subsequently allowed to take more money from your card than the amount you have already paid , so unfortunately it is not possible to have your tank topped-up . <p> While Suppliers acknowledge it may not be possible to determine exactly what your tank will hold they do ask that the order is for a specific volume/litres rounded to the nearest 100 litres - your best estimate of what will go in the tank . If the tank ca n't take the full volume ordered you will be refunded accordingly . <p> The minimum amount you can order is 500 litres . The average order is 1,000 litres . Domestic tanks typically range in size from 1,000 litres to 2,700 litres . If you do not have a gauge to tell you how much oil you have used , some tanks have a sight tube on the outside so you can see how full your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ garden cane or similar can be dipped in the tank to act as a dip-stick to give an indication of the oil level . <p> How do I Order and Pay for Oil to be Delivered to Another Address Rather Than My Home ( e.g. for a Relative/Friend/Holiday Cottage ) ? <p> Whilst getting a quote and placing your order , please use the address and postcode for the actual delivery address , rather than your normal home address ( if they differ ) . This is very important as the oil price is based on the delivery postcode . You will be asked to enter both a delivery address and a billing address . For most people these will usually be the same , but when ordering for someone else , or for a holiday home , they are likely to be different . The billing address must always match the credit/debit card used to pay for the order . <p> An Order Confirmation is automatically sent out to the email address you supply . Please first check on your account details that you entered it correctly . Please @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . To get there simply click the ' My Account ' link in the BoilerJuice website 's main menu . Each of your most recent orders will be listed . After your order has been processed , you will be able to view the full order confirmation on-screen , and this can easily be printed if required . If you do not see any orders listed then it may be that you did not complete the payment process . If you are not sure please contact us by emailing **33;0;TOOLONG and we will be pleased to assist . <p> For customers who are unable to accommodate a Standard 6-wheeler Delivery vehicle we offer a 4-wheeler tanker . If you live in an area that has very limited access , smaller " Baby Tankers " may also available . <p> If you require a smaller tanker for your order , please select either a 4-wheeler or " Baby Tanker " when obtaining your quote . If you do this , when your order is placed it will automatically go to a supplier who has a 4-wheeler or " Baby Tanker " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order . <p> If you do not select the correct tanker when you get your quote and place your order , your order may go to a supplier who is unable to make the delivery and , if we have to transfer your order to another Supplier , it could cost more and take longer . <p> You can order for more than one address but you will need to place a separate order for each one . Please make sure you tick the box marked " Alternate address " if you are placing an order for someone else . If you are doing this to obtain Group Savings please place the orders on the same day or over the weekend , from Friday to Sunday . <p> We do provide a delivery instructions section on our order form . However , this may not be read by the Supplier before the order is routed for delivery the day before . If you need to make arrangements to be at home when the delivery arrives please either phone the Supplier on the number provided on your order confirmation , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you as soon as we can . You will find our email form by clicking here . <p> Unfortunately our Suppliers are not able to send their tankers out with more than one person . If you have an access problem you will need to be there to assist the driver . Please either phone the depot , whose number appears on your order , or email **33;35;TOOLONG so we can ensure that you are able to be there when the delivery is made . <p> My Filling Access is What they Call an Offset Pipe , i.e. My Tank is Located Away from the Access or Filling Point . Do You Deliver to These Locations ? <p> For safety/environmental reasons most Suppliers decline to deliver to offset fill locations ( where the delivery driver can not see the tank whilst filling ) . We recommend you make arrangements direct with a regular Supplier . <p> We can offer " Baby Tankers " in selected parts of the country . If you select " Baby Tanker " when requesting a quote , we will advise you if there is availability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be suitable . <p> Most Suppliers decline deliveries which require the hose to be taken through a dwelling/living accommodation as their insurance will not cover for damage caused by a hose to white goods/furniture , dirty hoses , and leakages or spillages in a dwelling . Also Suppliers can at the driver 's discretion , decline to deliver through any part of a property that has white goods in situ i.e. Washing Machine , Tumble Dryer or Freezer etc . Therefore , this could include Hallways , Passageways , Garages , Extensions or Conservatories . If this is the case , we recommend therefore that you make arrangements direct with a Supplier . <p> Deliveries can not be made to tanks/fill points that do not meet the statutory requirements or are deemed unsafe . If upon arrival the driver considers the tank unsafe/not fit for purpose the delivery will not go ahead . <p> When you place your order please select a 4-wheeler or Baby Tanker when you obtain your quote . That way , if you do need a smaller tanker the order will automatically go to a supplier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ additional charge . If you do not select 4-wheeler or Baby Tanker at the time of ordering , your order may go to a supplier who is unable to make the delivery and if we have to transfer the order to another supplier this could cost more . <p> Why , When I Have Ordered at the Same Time as Neighbours , Are Our Prices Different ? <p> With every order , we automatically search for the lowest available price from our participating Suppliers . As Suppliers regularly change their prices throughout the day to stay competitive , your quoted price per litre is held as a guaranteed maximum price until the order is processed at 7am the next working day ( your final price per litre could go down when processed , but it will never go up ) . However , if a neighbour places their order some time later the same day , the price they are quoted will be based on the available prices at that exact moment . So , if Suppliers have changed their prices since your order was placed , your neighbour could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Price differences can also occur when people order different quantities of oil . <p> The Price You Have Quoted Me is Not The Cheapest I Can Find . Why is This ? <p> Prices vary daily so please make sure that you are comparing prices on the same day . The oil market is very competitive and we rely on our Suppliers to give us their very best prices . We are not always able to guarantee that our participating Suppliers have the cheapest price on the market . We are always happy to receive details from our members about local Suppliers you would recommend . Send us their details and we will invite them to apply to join our list of registered Suppliers . <p> The price of Kerosene28 is influenced by the price of crude oil which in turn , varies as a consequence of global events . Wars , political upheaval , terrorism and natural disasters are among the many factors influencing the price of crude oil . At home , bad weather , seasonal demand or interruptions to supply ( such as the Buncefield explosion ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more information on this please visit our " latest news section " on the homepage . <p> Our Merchant Services provider no longer accepts payment by Maestro card . This is because it was originally intended only for customer present transactions . They have allowed a transition period for this but we regret that they will no longer accepts these cards , Payment can be made if the Maestro card is MasterCard branded . Payment can be made by Mastercard or Visa , by debit or credit card . <p> Payment is by credit/debit card only . Our payment services are provided by SagePay , giving you the highest level of security for your peace of mind . You will be asked to enter your card details during your online order . Payment will be taken from your card at that time and any Group Savings will subsequently be refunded to your card as a separate transaction . Upon delivery , if the full order volume can not fit into your tank , you will be refunded accordingly for the difference . <p> Please note that we do not take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> BoilerJuice participate in the SecureCode and Verified By Visa schemes for your added security and peace of mind . <p> After you enter your credit or debit card details , your card issuer will usually ask for 3 characters from your SecureCode or Verified By Visa password . If you have forgotten your password there will usually be a link which you can click to update or create a password for your card . Please note that this is instant and you will be able to proceed with the order at the same place once you have created or changed your password . <p> Please note : Your SecureCode / Verified by Visa password may not be the same as your BoilerJuice account password . <p> If you continue to experience problems placing your order , please contact us and we will be happy to assist you . <p> What is the Credit Card Charge and Are BoilerJuice Allowed to Make This Charge ? <p> Payment is accepted by debit or credit card . There is a charge of approximately 1.8% for credit card payment and 1.5% for PayPal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cards . The credit card surcharge simply covers the additional costs incurred from the credit card issuers . <p> The The Consumer Rights ( Payment Surcharges ) Regulations 2012 state that a trader must not charge consumers , in respect of the use of a given means of payment , fees that exceed the cost borne by the trader for the use of that means . BoilerJuice are not charging more for using a credit card than the amount charged to us by our Merchant Services provider so are acting within this legislation . <p> It is an RDCO requirement that suppliers produce an invoice for all their deliveries , whether for their own customers or BoilerJuice customers . Some Suppliers then send these invoices out to everybody . If your invoice is for the same amount that you ordered or less , you do not owe the Supplier any money and can ignore the invoice . <p> Payment is taken as soon as you place your order and enter your credit/debit card details in our secure payment gateway . When your order is processed and sent to the oil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obtained , where applicable . We will refund the value of any under-delivery when the Supplier has confirmed the delivery volume to us . Refunds will always be made to the same card used to pay for the order . Even though we process your refund immediately after the delivery is confirmed by your Supplier , refunds will typically take 5 working days to appear on your account . <p> The amount of any under-delivery will be credited to your ' TankAccount ' and can be deducted from future orders . You can see this by logging onto ' MyAccount ' . If you would prefer to have the money refunded to your account you can do this from your ' MyAccount ' area once the delivery has been confirmed by the Supplier . <p> If I order 1,000 litres and the tank will not hold it do I still have to pay for 1,000 litres ? No . The amount of any under-delivery will be credited to your ' TankAccount ' and can be deducted from future orders . You can see this by logging onto ' MyAccount ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to your account you can do this from there . However the economics of oil supply and delivery are tight so please order a volume that is close to what the tank will hold . If the amount ordered is considerably more than your tank will hold the Supplier reserves the right to increase the price per litre . <p> We appreciate that it is difficult sometimes to tell exactly how much oil you need . However , because oil prices decrease the more you order , the Supplier does reserve the right to increase the price per litre if the amount you order is substantially more than your tank will take . Effective route planning is a critical factor and Suppliers load their tankers and schedule a delivery run of orders so as to return back to the depot with as little fuel as possible . Carrying fuel back is not cost effective for the Supplier and ultimately impacts on prices . So getting our order volumes reasonably accurate will help oil users in the long run . <p> It may be possible to cancel it as long as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Please email us immediately on **33;70;TOOLONG or phone 0800 151 3135 and we will assist you with this . Your money will be refunded to you as soon as the Supplier confirms the cancellation . This then takes the normal number of days to go through the banking system . There may be an administration fee upon cancellation if it is at your request and the delivery has already been routed by the Supplier . <p> Once an order has been cancelled the money is automatically refunded back to your card . However , it may take up to 5 working days before this shows on your statement . This is the time it takes to go through the banking system and is beyond our control . <p> Group Savings and under-deliveries are credited to your account . This money can then be used towards future orders . However , if you would prefer to have the money back on your card please log onto your account and go to the ' TankAccount ' section where you will be able to refund it back to your card . <p> If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on your account or to make payments into your Payment Plan any refund will be made back to the last card used , to the value of any transactions made with that card . If there is not enough to cover the refund then it will take the balance from a previous card . For this reason we advise customers never to use somebody elses card to place orders on your account . <p> Unfortunately our Suppliers are not able to send their tankers out with more than one person . If you have an access problem you will need to be there to assist the driver . Please either phone the depot , whose number appears on your order , or email **33;105;TOOLONG so we can ensure that you are able to be there when the delivery is made . <p> Your Order Confirmation email will give you the latest date that your order will be delivered . It can arrive at any time up until that date . If you have not received your order after that time we will be happy to contact the Supplier for you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and at very busy periods of high demand it may well be a little longer than stated but our Suppliers do try very hard to deliver within the estimated time shown . <p> All deliveries are monitored by the tanker 's meter and regulated by trading standards . Your delivery ticket will show you the actual amount of oil delivered , and this will be left with you by the Supplier . If you are not at home during the delivery they will usually post it through your letterbox . <p> We are not able to specify which supplier will deliver the oil prior to the order confirmation stage . The order will go to the Supplier from our database with the best price available to you when the order is processed . Your order confirmation email will state who the Supplier is . <p> The oil Supplier who secures your order is responsible for delivery . BoilerJuice automatically passes your order to a local reputable , accredited Supplier . Details of the Supplier are provided on your Order Confirmation email . <p> You only need to be at home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without you being there , or if you keep your tank locked . If you wish to be there please put " PHONE BEFORE DELIVERY " in the box marked " Delivery information for driver " when you place your order . If you do not request this you will not be contacted prior to delivery . <p> If you have not requested a call prior to delivery the oil will be delivered without the Supplier contacting you . If you wish to be there please put " PHONE BEFORE DELIVERY " in the box marked " Delivery information for driver " when you place your order . <p> No , please do not do this . Because you are paying for your oil when you place the order , you have already paid for a specific volume of oil and BoilerJuice is unable to take further money for any additional oil delivered . <p> This will depend on the delivery service you have requested . Your Order Confirmation email will state the expected latest delivery date , although the delivery may be made at any time up to this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high demand it may be made later than that date . <p> Please note : <p> Under unusual circumstances such as extreme weather conditions or high demand , the standard delivery time may be increased beyond 10 working days . However , the current Standard Delivery timescale is always displayed with your quote at the time of ordering . <p> Delivery times are quoted in working days only , which excludes weekends and bank/public holidays and start from the day after the order goes to the Supplier . <p> I Need a Delivery Earlier Than the Time Stated on the Order Confirmation . What Can I Do ? <p> If you have ordered on one of our Express Delivery options then the order will be delivered no later than the date on your Order Confirmation email . If you have ordered on our Standard Delivery option , for delivery up to 10 working days , then you will have to cancel your order and place a new one . <p> The first thing to do is check the expected delivery time ( indicated on your Order Confirmation email ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can contact the Supplier for an update . Full contact details of the Supplier are on the Order Confirmation email . Please note that increased demand during bad weather and the run up to Christmas will disrupt the scheduled delivery times . If you are unable to get through to the Supplier please email BoilerJuice on **33;140;TOOLONG and we will be pleased to assist . <p> Not necessarily . Simply tell your neighbours to order their oil on the same day as you and , provided you are all in the same postcode area ( ie the first half of the postcode ) BoilerJuice will automatically group your orders to get a group saving for you all provided the threshold level is achieved ( usually 2000 litres ) . <p> You can save money by using one of our Group Saving features . We queue all orders placed on our Standard Delivery service and place them with Suppliers at the beginning of the following working day . This allows us to buy in bulk and achieve lower prices . <p> Any savings achieved this way are passed on to you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . To get the best chance of a Group Saving on your order , simply tell your local friends and neighbours to order their oil on the same day as you and , provided you are all in the same postcode district ( the first half of the postcode , e.g. AB12 ) BoilerJuice will automatically group your orders . <p> We will tell you about any discount obtained when we send your Order Confirmation email . This is the email sent when the order is processed at the beginning of the next working day ( not the " Acknowledgement " email sent when you first place your order ) . <p> Buy oil today on our Standard Delivery service and if there are other orders in your postcode area , and the price is better , BoilerJuice will group your order with them .

Orders placed over the three days on our Standard Delivery Service are grouped together and sent to the supplier first thing Monday morning . You will be notified of any saving made . <p> Please note that if a UK Bank Holiday falls on a day next to a Buying Weekend , the Buying Weekend will be extended to include this day , giving you an even higher chance of saving . <p> Why Can I Not Get a Group Saving When I Order an Express Delivery Option ? <p> When you place an order for an Express Delivery it is sent straight to the Supplier in order for them to process it as quickly as possible . It is not , therefore , held overnight so can not be grouped with Standard Delivery orders . <p> When you first receive your quote , we automatically search for the lowest price available to you from our participating Suppliers for your required volume of oil at that time . This price is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it is held in our order queue until 7am the next working day . The queue is then processed and we group orders in each postcode area . <p> Group Savings will only be achieved if a lower bulk price can be obtained for the combined order volume . Sometimes a lower price is not possible , either because the combined volume was n't sufficient , or Supplier prices have been increased . <p> Unfortunately not . Because not all of our Suppliers are able to deliver using 4-wheelers , we are not able to include these orders as they have to be sent straight to the Supplier at the time the order is placed . <p> The amount of any group savings will be credited to your ' TankAccount ' and can be deducted from future orders .

A : Our heating additives are sent to you direct and are usually delivered by courier . They generally arrive before the oil tanker makes deliverey , but if they do n't there is no need to worry . You can easily add them yourself after the oil has been delivered . <p> Q : Can I mix BoilerMax additive with other additives I have already put into my tank ? A : Yes , they will be completely compatible if BoilerMax additive is added at the correct dose and the other additives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Q : Will any warranties on my boiler and equipment be affected ? A : No , heating oil containing BoilerMax additive meets the same Fuel Standard ( BS2869C2 ) as unadditised heating oil and therefore should not impact any warranties . <p> Q : I have read that BoilerMax additive works by avoiding deposits and operating problems that can occur , but does the treated fuel also instantaneously burn better in an existing clean system or have a higher energy content ( e.g. calorific value ) ? A : No , heating oil treated with BoilerMax additive has the same energy content as regular heating oil . It works by avoiding fuel degradation , deposits and other operating problems that routinely occur with systems operating overall several weeks . Instantaneous combustion improvers often have side effects that can cause damage to your boiler . BoilerMax additive does not contain them . <p> Q : Will BoilerMax additive be compatible with my boiler and do I need to consult my boiler engineer or boiler manufacturer first ? A : Heating oil treated with BoilerMax additive meets the same BS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you are currently using regular heating oil ( kerosene ) . You do not need to consult your boiler manufacturer or heating engineer prior to use . <p> Q : Can I extend my boiler service intervals if I use BoilerMax additive ? A : Theoretically the boiler service intervals can be extended in respect of fuel stability and deposit control . HOWEVER , we recommend boilers are serviced at the prescribed service intervals e.g. every 12 months as safety and emission checks are also included in these procedures . Your heating engineer may notice lower levels of deposits after the heating oil has been treated with BoilerMax additive . <p> Q : How long does it take for BoilerMax additive to start providing the benefits ? A : The time taken for a fuel correctly dosed with BoilerMax additive to start making a difference depends upon the weather conditions and fuel consumed . In most cases it will start to work in just a few weeks . Each 200ml BoilerMax additive bottle will treat 1000 litres of fuel . In most cases , there should be enough additive in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; if not , the full benefits of BoilerMax will not be present until used again at the next tank fill . <p> Q : Many technical folks believe in-service problems are dictated by a fuels Char Value ( IP 10 Method ) . Does using BoilerMax additive lower the Char Value ? A : Although some in-service problems have been attributed to high Char Values , we believe that the results from this test are highly variable and there is only a weak correlation with real world performance . The standard of boiler servicing is a key factor . Yes , fuel treated with BoilerMax additive does generally have a lower Char Value than untreated heating oil . <p> Q : How can using BoilerMax additive help lower operating costs ? A : During normal operation a boiler fires up and cuts out to maintain a constant room temperature ( usually controlled by a room thermostat ) . Deposits build up between services on nozzle and heat exchanger surfaces when using untreated heating oil without us normally knowing about it because the boiler is still working . The nozzle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the heat exchanger make it harder for the energy to transfer through to heat the water . In order to achieve the same room temperature the boiler needs to fire up and cut out a little more frequently and over time this increase use of the boiler burns more fuel . BoilerMax additive can also help lower costs by reducing the risk of boiler breakdowns , blocked filters , tank/metal parts rust and other common operating problems . <p> Please note : Some tanker drivers may be willing to apply your additives for you when your oil is delivered , unfortunately not all oil suppliers are able to do this due to internal health and safety policies .

@@99770517 @3970517/ 32886 @qwx892886 <h> 3 Ways to Prevent Heating Oil Theft in Your Area <p> Heating oil is a valuable commodity and because it is stored locally , unlike mains gas , it can easily become a target for thieves . Heating oil theft not only leaves you out-of-pocket , it can also leave you without any way of heating your home . Crimes are often committed in summer when stores are checked less regularly , but oil can be targeted at any time of year . Fortunately , there are a number of simple ways to prevent heating oil theft " check out our three easy solutions below . <p> Lock Your Tank <p> One of the simplest ways to secure your heating oil tank is to fit a lock on to the opening of the- tank . Locks come in a variety of sizes and generally take just a few minutes to install . In fact , some easy-fit ' locks require no drilling or DIY whatsoever . <p> If you 're installing a tank lock , make sure you- secure both oil extraction points : the filling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is using a tank arm ' , which is a specially-designed lock that protects both from siphoning , but there are other options available . <p> In conjunction with a secure locking system , tanks can be fitted with alarms which sound when oil levels drop suddenly . Of course , unless your alarm is visible it may not necessarily deter thieves , but it could help catch a thief in the act . In order for your alarm to work effectively , you must check- that your tank gauges are working correctly and make sure that you- check the alarm 's batteries on a regular basis . Modern alarm systems can also inform homeowners via text message , as well as sounding an alert on-site , so you can contact the authorities even if you 're away from home . <p> TOP TIP : If you choose to add security measures- to your tank , it 's a good idea to install a warning sign to let would-be thieves know that your tank is both locked and alarmed . <p> Keep a Look Out <p> It might sound obvious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theft is to keep a close eye on your heating oil . If possible , make sure your tank is in full view of the house so you can- see it , but not visible from nearby paths or roads . Many thieves are opportunistic and are unlikely to strike unless they know that you definitely have heating oil stored nearby . Installing movement-triggered lights can also help , as they will alert you to the presence of any intruders and could startle any potential thieves . <p> Of course , you ca n't watch over your fuel supply at all times , so installing CCTV cameras is another easy way to protect your oil when you 're not around . As with alarms , remember to let thieves know that you have CCTV installed , as it could act as a deterrent . It 's better to stop your heating oil from being stolen than it is to react to a crime that 's already taken place . <p> If CCTV cameras are too expensive , dummy cameras can be used to give the impression that your tank is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough to put off some potential thieves , it 's worth bearing in mind that if you are targeted you will not have any footage to hand over to the authorities . <p> Be Aware <p> Another easy way to help prevent heating oil theft is to raise awareness of any crimes that are being committed in your local area . If you know other heating oil users in your community , discuss concerns and work together to think of ways to improve your tank security . Its also a good idea to ask your neighbours to keep an eye on your tank when you go away on holiday to make sure it is n't targeted " next time they go on holiday you can return the favour ! <p> It 's also important to look out for reports of oil theft in the local news . If - you know oil thieves are active in the area , you can take extra care of your tank . You might also want to consider signing up for free email alerts from websites such as OilTheftWatch , which let you know if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the best way to improve awareness of fuel theft is to regularly check your oil levels , particularly during summer , so that if a crime does occur , it can be reported immediately . <p> Ultimately , the more aware you are of heating oil theft in your area , the easier it will be to protect your tank . <p> What do you think did we miss anything important ?

This is because oil prices tend to fall during the warm weather when no surprises here demand for heating oil drops . <p> The trouble is , when you 've quite a few litres left in your tank and you 're only using heating oil to heat your hot water , you can be tempted to put it off until the weather gets colder . <p> But , just like buying petrol before the Budget duty hikes , the best thing to do is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> If you have n't checked it out already , take a look at our Heating Oil Price graph . Every day we check the lowest 1,000 litre price of Kerosene 28 from all our heating oil suppliers . Then we log the minimum , maximum and average prices and put them on a graph on our website so you can track the change in oil prices and see if heating oil is going up or down . <p> Of course oil prices rise and fall like a roller coaster , but the general trend since the start of May 2010 is for heating oil prices to go down . <p> Obviously we ca n't predict what heating oil will do over the summer other things can affect oil prices ; not just the weather but historically oil prices usually go down . <p> Which is why our director , Paul , will be filling up his tank pretty soon .

Ltd , specialist providers of - heating oil tanks , we look at plastic heating oil tanks and answer some of the most frequently asked questions about this type of oil storage tank . <p> I 've Got a Plastic Oil Tank , Why Should I Check It ? <p> When plastic heating oil tanks first came out in this country about 25 years ago many people thought they would last forever , but this has never been the case and plastic tanks are only designed with a 10-15 year lifespan. - There have been problems with faulty polymers causing early failure of plastic tanks and therefore it is essential you check your tank on a regular basis. - Plastic tanks can start to crack ( especially if in full sunshine ) and if you notice any cracks appearing you need to take action . <p> If cracks are above the level of oil in your tank , get your tank replaced before it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over with something such as a tarpaulin to stop water from getting into your fuel . <p> If cracks are below the level of heating oil in your tank get a good old fashioned bar of soap and squeeze some into the crack which will temporarily stop it from getting any worse . Then get some fuel removed out of your tank so the fuel level is below the crack . However , you will need to get your tank replaced as soon as possible especially in hot weather . <p> You may see old plastic tanks for sale on Ebay . Be warned , these are fit for the scrap yard only . If you cracked tanks for sale with the vendor saying they can be fixed avoid them ! Tanks CAN NOT be repaired once they have started to fail ! <p> Is my Oil Tank Still Covered Under Warranty ? <p> Most plastic heating oil tanks have 10 year warranties on them and therefore you may still be able to claim something back from the manufacturer as long as the manufacturer is still trading ( some have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now only carry a two year warranty but most bunded tanks come with the 10 year guarantees . If you remember who installed your tank , speak to them first and they may be able to deal with it for you . If you can find your original proof of purchase that is great but its not always essential as most tanks would have a serial number stamped into them ( usually around the filler point ) which most manufacturers will go off if no proof of purchase is available . <p> One Final Tip About Plastic Oil Tanks- <p> It is also critical that any plastic tank is fully supported with either a flag or concrete base and if your tank is not fully supported you need to get it rebased as soon as possible. - Tanks should not be supported by timber as this will rot , could be a fire hazard and could - invalidate your warranty . <p> If you have any questions about heating oil tanks then please post a comment below and we will endeavour to get them answered by Wendi.

A new boiler is not cheap but should be more efficient at running your heating system . <p> Even among oil-fired boilers , the choice is bewildering . Choosing the right boiler is an important decision . If it is too small then it will not meet your needs while if it is too big it will have an impact in your wallet . The correct size of boiler is essentially determined by two broad factors : the volume of your house and how well it is insulated . Boiler output is usually measured in kW . As a general rule : 1kW is required per 10m3 <p> If you are replacing an existing boiler and your current boiler has been okay , then you should go with a similar size boiler but if you are starting from scratch , then you will need to consider : <p> Hot Water Usage <p> How many showers ? <p> How many sinks ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? <p> Size of House <p> How many rooms need are heated ? <p> What size are the radiators in these rooms ? <p> Heat Losses <p> The type of house : terraced , semi-detached , detached . <p> Does your house have cavity wall insulation ? <p> Do you have loft insulation ? <p> Do you have double glazing ? <p> Aesthetic Considerations <p> Do you want to hide the boiler in a cupboard ? <p> Condensing Boilers <p> Condensing boilers are more efficient than normal boilers. - As their name suggests , they use the hot water return to condense the gases in the flu exhaust to recover to heat- the water . This type of boiler can be very efficient , around 90% + saving you money on your- heating oil bill . Condensing boilers also reduce the amount of CO2 going into the atmosphere . It is estimated that around 60% of the carbon dioxide generated by domestic use comes from boilers . If every British household with central heating installed a high-efficiency boiler , more than 13million tonnes of CO2 would be kept from reaching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be that to squeeze every last measure of efficiency , condensing boilers are more complicated and so there is more to go wrong . However , - most are very reliable these days . <p> There are grants from the government for those upgrading boilers and improving the insulation in their homes . Find out if you are eligible at the Energy Saving Trust . <p> SEDBUK Rating <p> The efficiency of a boiler is given in terms of its SEDBUK ( Seasonal Efficiency of a Domestic Boiler in the UK ) rating . The scale goes from A-G , with boilers in the A range being 90%-91.3% efficient . If you want to save money on your heating oil then you should choose the most efficient boiler you can get . New boilers will be either A or B. You can find out more about SEDBUK Ratings at MyBoilerService.com . <p> In a drive to cut carbon emissions and improve energy efficiency , all new properties must be fitted with a condensing boiler by law . The building regulations state for oil-fired boilers : <p> All oil-fired boilers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boilers and again this applies to new installations and replacement boilers . <p> All condensing boilers fitted after the 1st April 2005 have to have a SEDBUK efficiency rating of either A or B. <p> Hot Water Tank or Combination ? <p> Combination boilers provide both water for heating and an almost instant supply of hot water , hence the name . They have become increasingly more popular . In fact , combination boilers- now account for well over half of all the new domestic boilers installed in Britain every year . The advantages are , there is only a very small reservoir of water that needs to be heated at any one time and no hot water tank is required so this could be an opportunity to save space although , oil-fired combination boilers are generally slower to provide hot water than some gas combi-boilers . Combination boilers may not be suitable for large houses where several people could be using the hot water at the same time . <p> Your heating and hot water requirements are individual to you so it is always a good idea to seek @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this has made you aware of the relevant questions to think about when choosing your next boiler. 
@@99770540 @3970540/ 32886 @qwx892886 <h> Dealing with Water in Your Heating Oil Tank <p> It may not be obvious that you have water in your heating oil tank until you have a problem with your boiler or Aga . It is something you need to keep an eye on and try to prevent if possible to avoid expensive call outs . <p> In extreme weather , it is possible that the water in your tank can freeze causing a blockage in the supply pipe . <p> Where Does the Water in my Oil Tank Come From ? <p> The two main sources of water in your oil tank will come from condensation or rainwater . Condensation can build up on the walls of the tank when there is a temperature difference between the tank and its contents and the outside temperature . Rainwater can enter your tank for a number of reasons including : <p> The filler cap being left off or not closed properly . <p> Faulty seals . <p> Damaged vents . <p> Cracks or splits in the tank . <p> Whilst making sure the filler cap is closed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other problems you will need to seek professional advice from an OFTEC registered engineer . <p> How do I Know if I Have Water in my Heating Oil Tank ? <p> Water in you heating oil tank can be difficult to detect visually because the water will sink to the bottom of the tank . The easiest way to detect it is to buy some water finding paste . This will change colour if water is detected in your tank . Water detecting paste is applied to a stick or rod that is long enough to touch the bottom of your tank ( a clean garden cane can be a good solution ) . The stick is placed into the tank so that it touches the bottom of the tank . You may need to leave it for a couple of minutes ( check the manufacturer 's instructions ) and then withdraw the stick carefully . If there is water present , the water finding paste will have changed colour . <p> How to Remove Water from Your Oil Tank <p> Once you have tested your tank and have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as soon as possible so that it does n't get into your boiler or Aga . If you have a metal heating oil tank you may find you have a sludge valve at the bottom of the tank which will allow you to drain off the water . If you have a plastic tank , you will need to have the water pumped out with a hand pump . This will need an OFTEC registered engineer . <p> You should also take care when disposing the water that is extracted as it will be contaminated with heating oil . You should NOT under any circumstances put it down the drain . Take it to a local authority waste disposal site which should have a waste oil collection tank . If you are n't sure where this is , contact your local council for advice . <p> You may need to have the boiler feed pipe flushed and the fuel filters changed once the water has been removed . <p> Our heating oil tank water removal kit is the perfect solution to this issue . It includes water finding paste and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and remove it . <p> How do I Prevent Water Building up in my Tank ? <p> The most obvious way to prevent water entering your tank is to make sure it is in good condition . Have it inspected annually by an OFTEC registered engineer and visually inspect it on a regular basis . See our tips on oil tank inspection . <p> To prevent condensation causing a problem in your oil tank , you can purchase oil tank water soakers that sit at the bottom of the tank and absorb the water . They are easily installed but they do need to be inspected regularly and changed every few months ( depending on the manufacturer ) . As with contaminated water , the tank water soaker will also have to be disposed of correctly to avoid contamination .

If the driver is unable to apply your additives please wear suitable PPE e.g. safety spectacles and gloves when applying your additives and dispose of your empty bottle in accordance with your local waste disposal guidelines . <p> Important notice : This product is not recommended for use with pressure-jet cookers . <p> Q : Will the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oil additives are sent to you direct and are usually delivered by Royal Mail . They generally arrive before the oil tanker makes deliverey , but if they do n't there is no need to worry . You can easily add them yourself after the oil has been delivered . <p> Q : How does the CookerMax additive work ? A : CookerMax additive has a mixture of anti-oxidants and other stabilisers that slow down fuel oxidation and therefore the rate of deposit formation on critical vaporising CookerMax surfaces . <p> Q : Can I mix CookerMax additive with other additives I have already put into my tank ? A : Yes , they will be completely compatible if CookerMax additive is added at the correct dose and the other additives have been designed for use in vaporising boilers . <p> Q : Will any warranties on my CookerMax and equipment be affected ? A : No , heating oil containing CookerMax additive meets the same Fuel Standard ( BS2869C2 ) as unadditised heating oil and therefore should not impact any warranties . <p> Q : Will there be any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hot temperatures ? A : No , heating oil treated with CookerMax additive will not be affected by extremes of weather , in fact this fuel will remain fresher for longer in very hot temperatures . <p> Q : I have read that CookerMax additive works by avoiding deposits and operating problems that can occur , but does the treated fuel also instantaneously burn better in an existing clean system or have a higher energy content ( e.g. calorific value ) ? A : No , heating oil treated with CookerMax additive has the same energy content as regular heating oil . It works by avoiding fuel degradation , deposits and other operating problems that routinely occur with systems operating overall several weeks . Instantaneous combustion improvers often have side effects that can cause damage to your boiler . CookerMax additive does not contain them . <p> Q : Will CookerMax additive be compatible with my boiler and do I need to consult my boiler engineer or boiler manufacturer first ? A : Heating oil treated with CookerMax additive meets the same BS 2869C2 specification and is therefore compatible with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( kerosene ) . You do not need to consult your boiler manufacturer or heating engineer prior to use . <p> Q : The CookerMax bottle does not seem quite full , how much should be in the bottle ? A : There is 200ml of additive in the bottle , but a space is left at the top to avoid " glugging " or spills while pouring in the contents into the oil tank . <p> Q : Can I extend my boiler service intervals if I use CookerMax additive ? A : No we recommend vaporising boilers are serviced according to the manufacturers schedule e.g. every 6 months . Your engineer may notice lower levels of deposits after the heating oil has been dosed with CookerMax additive . <p> Q : How long does it take for CookerMax additive to start providing the benefits ? A : The time taken for a fuel correctly dosed with CookerMax additive to start making a difference depends upon the weather conditions and fuel consumed . In most cases it will start to work in just a few weeks . Each 200ml @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In most cases , there should be enough additive in the bottle to treat the existing fuel in the tank ; if not , the full benefits of CookerMax will not be present until used again at the next tank fill . <p> Q : Many technical folks believe in-service problems are dictated by a fuels Char Value ( IP 10 Method ) . Does using CookerMax additive lower the Char Value ? A : Although some in-service problems have been attributed to high Char Values , we believe that the results from this test are highly variable and there is only a weak correlation with real world performance . The standard of boiler servicing is one of the key factors . Yes , fuel treated with CookerMax additive does generally have a lower Char Value than untreated heating oil .

@@99770570 @3970570/ 32886 @qwx892886 <h> Iraq Crisis Brings Instability to Heating Oil Prices <p> In recent months , heating oil prices have been moving in the right direction i.e. downwards . A trend that started uncharacteristically early in January 2014 largely because of the extremely mild winter . As we have moved into the warmer months , prices have continued to fall with average prices in the UK hitting levels not seen since 2011. - All of that changed abruptly last week with the growing unrest in Iraq spooking the commodity markets and resulting in a spike in crude oil prices . <p> Like the unrest in Syria at the end of August 2013 , the current march of the ISIS forces in Iraq is a serious concern to world oil markets . Despite the fact Syria was not an oil producing country , it did have critical oil supply pipelines under its control and , as a result , prices shot up by approximately $10 a barrel . Iraq , on the other hand , is OPEC 's second largest oil producer and exports approximately 3.3million barrels of crude oil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supply. - On the scale of things , 3.3 million barrels does n't sound like a lot until you realise that , if Iraq supplies went offline completely , this would potentially wipe out any spare capacity OPEC has and would inevitably lead to large price rises . <p> Equally as important as existing supplies of crude oil are future supplies . It is estimated that Iraq is sitting on the world 's 5th largest proven reserves of crude oil so the potential to increase production and provide a large percentage of world oil supplies is there . Iraq have , up until now , been focused on developing oil exports with production growth up by 22% since 2011 . The main driving force being that oil provides more than 90% of all government revenue and 75% of GDP. - It is believed that by 2019 production could be at 4.6m barrels a day and , beyond this some estimate Iraq could be producing between 6 and 8 million barrels a day. - That 's a lot of oil and , as world economies continue to grow , the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increasing demand . <p> Where are Prices Going ? <p> At the moment , the continuing march of ISIS towards Baghdad has driven prices up by approximately 5% to a 9 month high of $115 a barrel . We have n't yet reached the levels seen in the Syrian crisis last summer but analysts are predicting that if oil exports from Iraq fail , prices could exceed $120 a barrel . Victor Shum , vice president of IHS Energy Insight told Bloomberg that he expects to see a rise of at least $10-$15 a barrel . <p> Whether prices will hit new highs is largely down to whether ISIS are able to disrupt exports by either physically attacking and taking over the oil fields in the South of the country that account for 75% of all production or , as is more likely , disrupt supplies by targeting infrastructure that supports the regime in Baghdad. - There is already evidence of this happening with attacks on the main Baiji refinery near Mosul that produces 310000 barrels a day for internal use. - Baiji also happens to be a primary power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have taken over the dam at Haditha which could lead to disruption of electricity supplies to the main grid . <p> Of course , unrest in Iraq is not the only cause for concern in terms of escalating crude oil prices. - Ongoing disruption to supplies in Libya due to unrest , the increasing tensions between Russia and Ukraine and political instability in Venezuela and Nigeria are all potential trigger points for further price increases . <p> What Does this Mean for Heating Oil Prices in the UK ? <p> We have been relatively lucky over recent months in that the weather has worked in our favour and kept prices of heating oil down. - Other factors that have supressed prices include the recent strength of the pound ( we buy crude oil in dollars so when the pound is stronger , imports in dollars are cheaper ) and the fact that growth in China has slowed meaning demand for oil is not as strong . However , if the unrest and , perhaps more importantly , the uncertainty over Iraq continues , it is highly likely heating oil prices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the progress of ISIS in Iraq largely because UK heating oil users immediately saw the potential threat to prices , perhaps being reminded of last years ' hikes when Syria kicked off in late August. - At BoilerJuice we saw a large spike in volumes over the weekend of 13th June as people rushed to top up their tanks just in case prices started to rise . Largely as a result of this , prices did actually rise as demand increased and have now dropped back slightly . However , as higher crude oil prices filter down to heating oil the price will inevitably be affected , but by how much is harder to predict . - The Syrian conflict , which saw a $10 increase in crude oil prices resulted in a little over 2 pence per litre increase in heating oil. - So far , the Iraq conflict has seen a $5 increase in crude oil which as caused heating oil prices to rise by just over 1 pence per litre . - So heating oil price increases do appear to be proportional to crude oil prices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the uncertainty in Iraq is likely to last . It appears that the Americans are n't in any hurry to step in and try and secure the situation which could mean , as it has in Syria , that the conflict could drag on for many months. - With Syria , once the initial crude oil price rises had happened , they held for a very short space of time ( approximately 3-4 weeks ) before falling to pre-crisis levels once oil speculators realised that the US was not going to bomb Syria .

One of the quickest and easiest ways to achieve this is by using a heating oil additive . <p> Heating oil additives are a mixture of anti-oxidants , dispersants , detergents , corrosion inhibitors , metal deactivators and other fuel stabilisers . They offer a number of benefits , including improving the efficiency of the heat transfer between the fuel and the water used to heat your home . <p> The majority of heating oil boilers work by spraying oil and burning it with a mixture of air . Over time , the nozzle used to spray the fuel and the components used to transfer heat can become clogged with sludge and other residue , reducing the efficiency of the heating process . Heating oil additives can break down these deposits and reduce the likelihood of them forming in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When the heat transfer process is made more efficient , less fuel has to be burnt in order to achieve the same room temperature , saving you money on your energy bills . <p> By removing the build-up of sludge and spent fuel , additives also reduce the likelihood of your boiler breaking down . Some heating oil boilers have been used for decades and whether in constant use or not , rust and general wear and tear can cause problems . Additives contain lubricants to help maintain the smooth running of your heating oil boiler , which means they can provide considerable savings compared to paying for unnecessary repairs . In fact , one 200ml bottle of additive can treat approximately 1,000 litres of heating oil and has a shelf life of two years from the date of production . If heating oil users are looking for new ways of improving the efficiency of their boiler , there are plenty of options available to them , but not many are as cost-effective . <p> Using additives also helps reduce fuel degradation " a major cause of boiler problems . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the two main types of domestic heating oil , to breakdown . However , anti-oxidants contained in heating oil additives stop the oil from deteriorating at such a rapid rate .

If the delivery driver is unable to apply the additive , heating oil users should make sure that safety gloves and spectacles are worn when mixing . <p> Top Tips for Using Additives- - <p> Although heating oil additives offer a number of advantages , users should bear in mind that it is not a replacement for regular boiler maintenance . It is still recommended that boilers are serviced at least once a year by an OFTEC qualified engineer in order to ensure optimum safety and efficiency . Heating oil boilers can breakdown for a variety of reasons and when unmaintained can lead to carbon monoxide leaks , so regular servicing is crucial . <p> It is also important to remember that additives do not actually alter the chemical composition of your fuel . Heating oil is already extremely energy efficient , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Additives do provide a mixture of various chemicals , but the heating oil you are using remains fundamentally the same . <p> Some heating oil users might find that purchasing premium kerosene is an easier way of getting additives into their tank . Premium kerosene has already been treated with fuel-stabilising additives prior to purchase and enhances the performance of heating systems and oil-fired cookers . In periods where the price of heating oil is high , buying additives or premium fuels can save you huge sums over a long term period . <p> Purchasing additives may not be an obvious way of improving your heating oil efficiency , at least not compared with servicing your boiler , but it is effective . What 's more , a single bottle of additive can be used over a period of two years , so as an investment it 's an inexpensive way of saving money on your heating bills .

Unlike gas , which is supplied as and when you need it , heating oil must be delivered and then stored in a nearby tank so protecting your heating oil is crucial if you want to stay warm all year round . <p> Luckily there are a number of ways you can protect your heating oil investment , whether it 's against leaks , theft or just general wear and tear over time : <p> 1 ) Buy Quality Fuel <p> One of the first heating oil tips to follow , is to make sure you 're dealing with an oil distributor that abides by the FPS ( Federation of Petroleum Suppliers ) Code of Practice .

According to a report released today by the NEA and Energy Action Scotland ( EAS ) to coincide with the awareness event , over 4.5 million homes in Britain are living in fuel poverty , with low incomes , soaring energy prices and poor insulation pushing a growing number of families , pensioners and vulnerable people into the situation each year . <p> The charities also released shocking figures that show a huge disparity in the amount of money spent improving energy efficiency for low income homes in the UK , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ likely to fall into fuel poverty , but also more likely to receive support .

Unfortunately , heating oil prices are notoriously difficult to predict , with dozens of factors affecting prices on a daily basis . - <p> While we cant promise a magic formula for predicting what will happen with heating oil prices in 2015 , we do have a few tips to help you out . Check out the info below to learn what affects heating oil prices in the UK and work out how to spot upcoming trends . <p> Fluctuations in heating oil prices are often the result of a combination of several factors : - <p> Weather <p> Weather is one of the main factors that affects heating oil prices in the UK . Generally , when temperatures drop , people use their heating more . This can result in a sudden surge in demand for heating oil , which causes prices to spike . <p> Cold weather also puts more pressure on Suppliers , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snow . This can cause delivery issues which can drive up the Supplier 's transportation costs . <p> On the other hand , during warm months there is less demand for heating oil and supply is plentiful so prices tend to decrease . For this reason , a lot of heating oil users choose- to stock-up on their heating oil when temperatures are high and prices are low . <p> WARNING : Extreme weather conditions can affect prices very quickly , so it 's a good idea to keep an eye on weather forecasts and order early when possible . <p> Supply &amp; Demand <p> As with any commodity , supply and demand plays a very big part in heating oil pricing . If demand soars when supplies are low , this puts a lot of financial pressure on Suppliers , who are forced to purchase emergency supplies at a higher price . This can also happen if oil production is cut during a period of high demand , as it will be difficult for Suppliers to source their oil . <p> On the other hand , during times of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is not as much need for heating oil ) , prices often drop . This can also happen if there are a large number of heating oil suppliers in your local area , as competition can drive down prices . <p> Refining Costs <p> Heating oil is a by-product of crude oil , and as such , needs to be broken down and processed before it can be used . This procedure is called distillation and is carried out- at- an- oil refinery . Although Kerosene is one of the easiest ( and therefore the cheapest ) oil products to distil from crude , there are several factors that can affect the cost- of this process . Changes in personnel , equipment , taxes or transportation fees for the companies that carry out this procedure can ultimately affect how much you pay for your heating oil on a domestic level . <p> Distribution and Delivery Costs <p> As Suppliers do not produce their own oil , they need to source their supply from the nearest refinery or oil storage facility . There are only a few refineries in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distance to collect oil before distributing it to their customers . <p> As many heating oil users live in remote , rural areas , this can also affect delivery costs , as the tankers have to travel further to get there . However , most suppliers make a conscious effort to reduce these costs , and many even offer a bulk-buy saving to customers who order on the same day in the same area , as this means that the delivery tanker can deliver these orders in one go rather than travelling back and forth over a number of days . <p> Currency Exchange Rates <p> As oil is sold in US Dollars , currency exchange rates have a big effect on the price of heating oil in the UK . If the exchange rate between British Pounds and US Dollars shifts , it could affect how much suppliers are paying for their supply , which in turn would affect domestic heating oil prices across the UK . <p> TIP : - As currency rates can be influenced by many things ( including political and economic events ) , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep an eye out for changes . <p> VAT Rates <p> VAT ( also known as value-added tax ) is a form of consumption tax that is added to many of the things we use in day-to-day life . Currently , domestic heating oil has a reduced VAT rate of 5% , while heating oil that is used for business purposes- ( e.g. for agriculture or construction ) is generally subject to a standard VAT rate of 20% . The last VAT shift was in January 2011 ( from 17.5% to 20% ) , but if it rises again in the future this could affect- heating oil prices . <p> Crude Oil Prices <p> As heating oil is a by-product of crude oil , changes in the crude oil market have a huge- influence on heating oil prices . If the barrel price of crude increases or decreases , this directly influences how much suppliers will have to pay for their oil supply , which in turn affects- the cost of heating oil . <p> OPEC <p> OPEC ( Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries ) , is an international @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a large portion of the world 's crude oil reserves are controlled by these countries , this organisation has the ability to influence the production of oil , which can affect- supply levels and prices on a global scale . <p> For example , if OPEC decided to drop their prices to undercut gas rates , there would be a surplus of oil at a low price . On the other hand , if they stopped oil production over a peak period when demand was high , suppliers may struggle to source their oil- and heating oil prices could increase . <p> As crude oil prices have a large influence on heating oil prices , anything that causes those prices to increase can result in higher heating oil costs for customers in the UK . This includes anything that may impact the production or transportation of oil supplies , such as war , conflict , oil spills or natural disasters . <p> What to Look out For : - Any major disruption in countries related to OPEC , as well as other oil-producing countries such as Norway , China , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @

Will they drop even further ? <p> Well the answers would be we do n't  know , and maybe . <p> Not very helpful we agree , but- at the moment were not sure anybody knows .

However , in recent weeks , the extremely stormy weather we have been experiencing in the UK including flooding and high winds has highlighted the need to make you aware of other potential risks to your oil tank . <p> Heating Oil Tanks and Flooding <p> Flooding risk to oil tanks is not something that is discussed frequently but the implications of spillages because of flooding are significant for the householder . In the event of flooding , your heating oil tank may start to float . This can cause pipes attached to the tank to break and lead to spillage . Not only do householders potentially lose their heating oil , they may be faced with a large bill for the clean-up necessary . In view of this , householders should : <p> Make sure they have a good level of house insurance that covers not just heating oil loss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can run into many thousands of pounds ) . <p> Check the heating oil tank is secured correctly so that , in the event of a flood , it can not float . This will require work by an OFTEC registered heating oil tank installer . <p> Ensure heating oil tanks are not located close to boreholes , wells , springs or watercourses . <p> Make sure heating oil tanks are built on suitable supports that will raise the tank above the likely flood level . Note , there may need to be consultation with your local authority regarding planning permission as there are height restrictions in place for oil tanks . <p> Heating Oil Tanks in High Winds <p> High winds have also been a feature of the weather in Winter 2013/2014 and , as a result , heating oil users should be aware of the potential risk to their heating oil tanks . Although unlikely , particularly if the tank is full , tanks can be dislodged from their stands by strong winds . Additionally , the tank may be hit by flying objects such as a tree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could result in damage to the tank and leaks occurring. - Householders should : <p> Make sure there are not any large trees close to the tank that would cause damage if they fell on the tank . If there are , it would be advisable to trim them back or remove them . <p> Secure heavy garden ornaments and furniture if high winds are forecast to prevent these hitting the oil tank . <p> Have the oil tank secured correctly with strapping . Consult an OFTEC registered engineer to make sure this is installed correctly . <p> If the tank is near the home and could be hit by a roof tile , consider some sort of protective cage over the tank to prevent damage in this scenario . <p> As with flooding , make sure there is a good level of insurance to cover both loss of heating oil and spill clean-up . <p> For more information about maintaining and securing heating oil tanks :

Every year , we try to encourage our customers to order their heating oil early to avoid this last minute rush but , more importantly , to save money as prices inevitably rise as demand increases. - However , it 's not just about saving money it 's also about making sure you have enough oil for the coldest months of the year and you do n't run out . Here are some good reasons why you should order in good time and keep your tank topped up in the winter : <p> As we have already mentioned , as we head into winter and people start to use more oil , demand increases , particularly around Christmas when everyone wants to make sure their house is cosy and warm for the festivities. - The inevitable consequence of higher demand is higher prices and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - If suppliers are really busy they may not be able to deliver to you before your supply runs out or you may have to pay a premium for an express delivery .

Some -15 million of state funding is going towards the new Green Homes Cashback scheme , which will give households the chance to apply for thousands of pounds of funding for improvements to energy efficiency . Minister for energy Fergus Ewing announced the scheme and stated that Scotland is already outperforming the rest of the UK in terms of energy efficiency upgrades . Mr Ewing commented : " This new and more intensive phase of Green Homes Cashback will make a real difference to people across the country , saving money on fuel bills and helping to cut emissions . " From June and throughout the next economic year , households will be able to apply for up to -7,300 of funding to pay for improvements to their home . Mr Ewing noted this is the latest commitment the Scottish government has made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of almost a quarter of a billion pounds over a three-year period . He added : " This government is leading investment on energy efficiency for low income households , with figures from Energy Action Scotland showing that on average , -3.52 is invested in England , compared with -36.48 in Scotland , -31.31 in Wales and -27.55 in Northern Ireland .

Large parts of Scotland are cut off from the power grid and , as fuel poverty is more likely to affect those who live in rural parts of the country , the scheme could very well focus on aiding householders in these areas .

These include : <p> Factors That May Depress the Price of Oil in 2014 <p> US Oil Production : The introduction of fracking in the US has meant US oil production has been boosted by an estimated 2-3 million barrels per day . This , along with increased production in other non OPEC countries such as Canada and Brazil has already had a dampening effect on oil prices by reducing the influence of OPEC and ensuring higher levels of supply. - It is expected that US oil production will continue to increase next year thus helping to control oil prices . <p> Political Issues : The US debt ceiling crisis may have been temporarily solved but it will drag on into 2014 as another decision on raising the debt ceiling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lead to uncertainty as the new deadline approaches which could depress prices due to fears of recession . Additionally , oil prices have been boosted through 2013 by the continuing fiscal stimulus in the US . It is highly likely that the Federal Reserve will start to taper off the stimulus in 2014 which could lead to an increase in the value of the dollar and hence a decrease in the price of oil . <p> Middle East Unrest : 2013 saw spikes in oil prices due to unrest in Egypt and escalating tensions over Syria . However , as we approach the end of 2013 and move into 2014 , the situation in these two areas is looking calmer and oil prices have fallen back as a result . Add to this the apparent thawing of relations between the US and Iran and oil production levels in Libya now picking up after protests over the summer of 2013 , could mean oil prices in 2014 are not subject to uncertainty caused by unrest in this important oil producing area of the world . <p> Factors That May Increase the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Had this article been written back in early 2013 , world economies may well have been a factor depressing the price of oil . However , in recent months the world economic outlook has improved slightly with positive news from China , Europe and the US indicating GDP growth is expected to increase in 2014 . Economic growth inevitably leads to an increase in demand for oil which leads to an increase in prices . <p> Other Factors that Could Affect the Price of Oil in 2014 <p> Production Issues : Problems with oil extraction and refining facilities can increase oil prices but how these will affect prices in 2014 is difficult to predict . There were unplanned maintenance overruns and political unrest in Libya that affected production in 2013 , neither of which were predicted . <p> Weather : The weather has a particularly strong influence of heating oil prices and the long cold spring in 2013 certainly kept prices in the UK higher for longer . The difficulty of predicting the weather for winter 2013/2014 means that this is an unknown factor . Obviously , if it turns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will inevitably rise as demand rises . <p> Local Factors:Local heating oil prices can be affected by not only the weather . If there is a particularly competitive market in one area this can drive down costs . Additionally , local issues with supply due to disruption at local depots can cause prices to increase . The remoteness of your location will also affect how much you pay . <p> What Will Happen in 2014 ? - <p> At the time of writing the general consensus appears to be that oil prices in 2014 should remain at similar if not slightly lower levels than late 2013 but , as history has taught us , with so many variable , prices are hard to predict as we never quite know what is round the corner .

@@99770719 @3970719/ 32886 @qwx892886 <h> Like the Idea of a Heating Oil Monthly Savings Scheme ? <p> Gas and electricity suppliers do something similar ; phone providers do it and now BoilerJuice could be doing it too if you 'd like us to . <p> Basically , the plan would be for you to pay for your heating oil on a monthly payment basis so you build up a Tank Account ' of savings to go towards each heating oil purchase . <p> It 's not a direct debit scheme ; instead we 'd charge your debit card with the same pre-agreed amount every month . You only need to tell us your debit card details once . And if you ever want to cancel , you can " at any time . <p> The great thing about a Heating Oil Savings Scheme is that it means you do n't have to pay for your oil in one go . And if your tank is particularly big , it could soften the blow quite a bit ! <p> Also it makes sense to pay a smaller amount all year round rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you suddenly realise you 're running low on heating oil " especially if that happens around Christmas . <p> How much you pay per month would be based on your annual heating oil usage to date divided by 12 so unless your heating oil usage has decreased dramatically , there would n't be any risk of you over paying . However if , come the end of the year , we find you have overpaid you 'll get the option to carry it forward to the next year or get a rebate . <p> But what else would you get out of us hanging on to your cash rather than it sitting in your bank account earning interest ? <p> Perhaps we could give you an incentive " like offering a discount on heating oil prices to thank you for agreeing to pay monthly in advance . Or maybe you 've some other ideas on how this could best work for you . <p> Our new Heating Oil Savings Scheme is still very much at drawing board ' stage , so we 'd welcome your suggestions on ( a ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ b ) what ( if any ) incentives you 'd like to see to encourage you to sign up for it . <p> What we do n't want to do is suddenly dump ' a Heating Oil Savings Scheme onto you which is n't what you want " or which you feel could be done differently or better . So we 'd welcome your suggestions .

@@99770722 @3970722/ 32886 @qwx892886 <h> Why are Heating Oil Prices Falling ? <p> We 've seen a 20 month low on heating oil prices in the last week , despite the fact there is turmoil in Ukraine that could affect Russian oil supplies to the rest of Europe . So what is going on ? Why have heating oil prices continued to tumble ? <p> Mild Winters Keep Heating Oil Prices Low <p> One of the biggest reasons heating oil prices in the UK have n't seen their usual seasonal climb has been due to the unseasonably warm weather we have experienced over the last few months . Despite the fact we had one of the wettest winters on record , the temperatures were above normal meaning people just did n't burn through as much oil as you would normally expect . As a result , demand has been lower this winter than previous winters and we all know the basic rules of supply and demand ! <p> The situation in the US this winter has been somewhat different with very cold weather driving up heating oil prices there . However @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so this is also reducing US demand . <p> US Oil Production has Increased <p> Now that the US is moving ahead at a rapid pace with fracking , they are ramping up shale oil production . As a result , the US is reducing the demand for world oil supplies because they have less need to import oil . Result : more oil for the rest of us and , as before , the laws of supply and demand come into play . Lower demand equals lower prices . <p> It 's not just the US either . Countries such as Canada are also upping production meaning there is more oil available in the market . <p> US Economic Policy <p> The Federal Reserve has now started to taper off its quantitive easing programme in the US . Whilst this is a very gentle taper , any signal that indicates the US dollar will strengthen will cause oil prices to fall . So , most of the forecasts for oil prices in 2014 , including those of the International Energy Agency , are that they will fall and could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ economic data from China has indicated that their economy may be slowing . This will also have the potential to reduce oil prices as China is now believed to be the largest importer of oil in the world . <p> Iranian Oil Supply <p> The thawing of relations between the US and Iran which started with talks towards the end of - 2013 could well lead to Iranian oil supplies coming back on-line in 2014 thus offering the world another source of crude oil . Again , this will help to ease any supply concerns in the global oil markets . Whilst this has n't yet happened , commodity markets will be factoring this into to oil futures . <p> Will Heating Oil Prices Remain Low ? <p> The simplest answer to this question is that , as we approach the summer months heating oil prices traditionally drop as demand falls . However , there are many factors that could drive up prices including the situation in Ukraine , unrest in Venezuela ( the world 's fifth largest oil exporting country ) and increasing turmoil in Libya which could lead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spike in prices in late August last summer when the situation in Syria looked as if it may result in US military action . The same could well happen over the coming months if any of these potential conflicts erupt . <p> Add to this the more positive outlook for world economies in general and this could also drive up heating oil prices in the coming months .

He said that in particular , it prevents those living in fuel poverty in rural areas from accessing the scheme . Mr Hawksley added : " Weve been informed that ministers were advised that the recently launched domestic Renewable Heat Incentive ( RHI ) must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gas homes can choose either the RHI or a simpler boiler upgrade . " <p> The government says that the Green Deal Home Improvement Fund will encourage homeowners to improve energy efficiency and reduce carbon emissions . This will happen by consumers being offered a grant of up to -1,500 to use on the installation of a new condensing boiler alongside one other Green Deal insulation measure . <p> Mr Hawksley went on to accuse the government of failing to introduce energy efficiency measures for the fuel-poor households using oil . He added : " Typically these are more at risk of fuel poverty because their homes tend to be older , poorly insulated and therefore cost more to heat .

Last year , over 31,000 people died from cold weather related illnesses which highlights the scale of the problem in the UK and the need to make sure we protect the vulnerable . <p> Heat Loss and Where to Insulate <p> The problem facing many households today will be what to insulate and what they can afford . For low income households , there is the Energy Company Obligation scheme which aims to insulate and improve the efficiency of households . Any households can also take advantage of the Green Deal , a loan scheme designed to help householders pay for insulation and energy efficiency improvements up front and then pay back the loan via their energy bills . However , whatever scheme a household uses , it is worth actually understanding where most households lose heat so that insulation can be prioritised in these areas . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that heat loss occurs as follows : <p> Walls- 35% <p> Roof " 20% <p> Windows " 15% <p> Ventilation " 15% <p> Floors " 10% <p> Doors " 5% <p> Source : PHPP <p> It should be remembered that this is a study of a mix of housing and there will be differences according to the type of house you live in . If , for instance , you live in a mid-terrace property , the heat loss from the walls will be less because you have fewer external walls . The same is also true if you live in a flat . However , this data does give homeowners some help in where to focus spend on insulation . It clearly shows that if you do live in a detached property , you are going to get more benefit from looking at cavity wall insulation than insulating your floors or windows . <p> How Much Will You Save by Insulating Your Home ? - <p> So , when considering insulation for your home , consider the above data and focus your energies on the areas of your home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The savings can be quite considerable so you may find they pay for themselves relatively quickly .

Any threat to Russia 's ability to sell oil and gas would have a massive impact on their economy and will be something that President Putin is factoring into his thoughts . - Having said that , an increase in oil prices is good for the Russian economy as long as they can avoid disruption to supplies . <p> Europe is at more threat from any political manoeuvring by President Putin with 34.5 percent of the EU 's oil imports coming from Russia .

It means that the margin between gas , which is the cheapest , and heating oil has fallen significantly from 60% to just 12% . <p> Why Have Heating Oil Prices Dropped ? <p> There are a number of factors that have contributed to lower heating oil prices including : <p> The supply of oil on world markets has risen as a result of a dramatic increase in production from the US as fracking has taken hold and started to produce results . <p> The world-wide slow-down in economies across the world in the last three to five years has meant demand for oil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A mild winter 2013/2014 has meant demand for heating oil in the UK has been low . <p> The announcement towards the end of 2013 of the Federal Reserves decision to start to reduce quantitative easing in the US signals that the dollar may start to rise in the near future and hence oil prices may fall . <p> Initial talks with Iran over their nuclear program went well and have raised confidence that existing trade sanctions on the sale of oil may be lifted and thus increase supply . <p> Price Increases in Other Domestic Fuels <p> As OFTEC pointed out , the margin between oil and other domestic heating fuels has dropped considerably but this is n't due to large drops in heating oil prices . What we have seen and the press has been quick to report is large increases in gas and electricity prices . The graph below clearly shows the significant rises in electricity and gas . <h> Data from Sutherland Tables based on comparison in price of heating a three bedroom home in January 2011 to January 2014 . <p> Off Grid Users Still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ users , heating oil is still more expensive than gas . For off-grid homes this does mean that in recent years , many home owners have looked at other renewable sources of energy , primarily heat pumps to supplement their heating and thus reduce consumption of heating oil . The main issue with this is that electricity is used to power heat pumps and , as this keeps rising in price , the benefits from of this form of renewable energy are eroded . <p> Will The Situation Continue ? <p> There is little question that there is significant pressure on the gas and electricity companies to reduce bills . The change in green levies at the end of 2013 did lead to energy companies cutting recently announced rises but they were still well above the rate of inflation . With the Energy Secretary , Ed Davey , requesting a full investigation into the market , there could be significant changes ahead in the domestic energy market but , how this will impact on gas and electricity prices is questionable . <p> Heating oil in some ways is slightly easier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ community at present is that oil prices will remain relatively steady and the average price may even be slightly lower than it was in 2013 . However , as economic growth picks up in the West , demand is going to pick up which will drive prices higher . How much higher will depend largely on how much additional production the US brings on line , whether Iran starts exporting oil again and whether supply issues from Libya are resolved once and for all . <p> What 's the Best Advice for Heating Oil Users ? <p> Heating oil users have one major benefit over gas customers in that they can pick and choose when to buy their oil . Careful monitoring of heating oil prices can help home owners make savings on their fuel and thus keep annual heating costs down . <p> If you are considering renewable energy sources such as heat pumps , you will need to research this thoroughly to ensure this is still going to give you savings .

@@99770743 @3970743/ 32886 @qwx892886 <h> What 's Happening with Heating Oil Prices ? <p> Over the last few months heating oil prices have not been behaving as we would normally expect . Just comparing average UK prices in the first few months of this year with the same period last year reveals a completely different pattern. - Not only that , we have seen average prices at levels not seen since 2010 . What has caused this and why , despite relatively stable crude oil prices , are heating oil prices continuing to fall ? <p> Crude Oil Prices <p> As we have said in many previous blogs , heating oil prices are largely affected by the price of crude oil from which it is refined . The price of crude oil is in turn- affected by a multitude of factors ranging from currency fluctuations , supply and production problems , and unrest in oil producing countries to name a few . Despite unrest in Ukraine and worries about Russia cutting energy supplies to Europe which could have sent prices rocketing , a strengthening pound which typically reduces the price of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Libya , again likely to drive oil prices higher , the price of Brent crude since January has remained relatively stable at around $108/barrel. - Unusually , given the stable price of crude , this means the current continuing decline- in heating oil prices ca n't be attributed to the crude oil price . <p> The Influence of Weather on Heating Oil Prices <p> This leaves the weather as the other main factor influencing the current decline in heating oil prices . Probably the most significant difference between the first five months of 2014 and the previous year has been the weather . As you may recall , the winter of 2012/2013 the cold weather went on well into Spring- with snow falling as late as mid-April . This had a big impact on heating oil prices as demand for heating oil was much higher . You can see from the chart that as soon as this cold snap ended , prices dropped dramtically from a high of 65.73ppl on 10th April 2013 to 56.26ppl on 6th May 2013 . This year we have n't seen any significant spike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mild winter . Heating oil consumption was much lower and , as a result , prices have remained low . <p> Energy Efficiency <p> This leaves us with the question : Are lower heating oil prices- this year just the result of- the mild weather or are other factors beginning to impact on the way consumers use heating oil ? We do know that over the last few years everyone has been feeling the pinch with the cost of living outstripping any salary increases by a significant margin . We also know from data that electricity prices have risen by over 30% since 2010 . Given this is the other main source of energy for heating oil users , this may well be having an impact . It is unlikely however that in the space of a year , heating oil users would significantly reduce their consumption over and above a natural reduction caused by a mild winter. - The Office for National Statistics reported last year that between 2005 and 2011 households have reduced their consumtption of gas and electricity by 24.7% showing- householders have been taking steps to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no reason to believe heating oil users would have been doing anything different . <p> Conclusions <p> We can never be entirely sure what causes such anomalies in data but we can be fairly certain that this years dramatic drops can be largely attributed to the weather . Thinking back over the last few winters , they have on the whole , been cold with heavy snowfall and below average temperatures . This year was very different so we can expect that should we see another cold winter in 2014/2015 , prices will once again go back to their usual pattern . Of course , we wont know until next winter . All we can say is , in the meantime , take advantage of the low prices and fill your boots ! <p> - Tell Us What You Think <p> Let us know what you think about current heating oil prices ?

Very mild weather has dampened demand and , as a result , prices have stayed unseasonably low throughout the winter months as the average price chart shows below . <p> That in itself is not unusual as demand is one of the biggest contributors to rising heating oil prices however , data from Nasdaq.com indicates that since the beginning of February , Brent Crude oil has risen from just above $105 a barrel to over $109 without any signs that this is impacting on UK heating oil prices . <p> The US Freezes and Heating Oil Prices Rise <p> The rise in Brent crude is largely down to what is happening in the US .

Since heating oil is refined from crude oil , this has caused international prices ( including Brent Crude which UK heating oil prices largely follow ) to increase . <p> Other Pressures on Oil Prices <p> To add further pressures on the price of crude oil , Libya has recently reported that they are , once again , seeing disruption to supplies due to protests at major oil fields . A recent Reuters report also suggests that protests that have arisen in Venezuela are raising supply worries , causing crude oil prices to increase . - Add to this the fact that the US dollar dropped to a six week low on Monday and the European economies are picking up , all the ingredients for higher oil prices and hence heating oil prices are in place . <p> So you could conclude that UK heating oil users have actually got off fairly lightly this winter . The mild weather has offset rises in oil prices caused by US demand . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pay the bills but it does at least mean the usual mad dash for heating oil has n't happened and , as a result , prices have stayed relatively stable . Whether the situation will remain this way is difficult to say . A sudden cold snap in Europe or serious supply issues elsewhere in the world could be all it takes for heating oil prices to start rising again . <p> In the meantime , we can celebrate the fact that , as reported by OFTEC on 17th February 2014 , heating oil is the only primary heating fuel that has come down in price over the past three years .

However , Societe Generale have said that even if a comprehensive agreement is the final outcome , it would take Iran between 3 and 9 months to ramp up exports to pre 2011 levels .

At this stage it is difficult to tell as we are now heading into the winter season where demand picks up significantly and any cut in crude oil prices may not necessarily result in a cut in heating oil prices . Given that any easing of oil exporting sanctions wo n't come into place with Iran until 6 months down the line , it is unlikely that any significant price drops will take place beyond the initial reaction from the markets to increased stability in Middle Eastern oil supplies that the agreement may bring . <p> So , whilst the agreement is good news , any real effect wo n't take place until 6 months time if Iran keeps to its promises .
