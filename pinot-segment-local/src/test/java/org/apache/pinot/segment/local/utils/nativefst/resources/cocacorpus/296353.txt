It takes some preparation and patience but its well worth it . here 's the breakdown : <h> Step #1 : Cleanse Your Hair- <p> Always straighten clean hair free from product buildup . You will always get better results starting with a clean slate and you can avoid cooking that leftover product on your hair . <h> Step #2 : Strengthen your hair before you straighten- <p> Heat styling takes a huge toll on your hair even if you are meticulously careful , so its best that you prep your hair if you plan on straightening it . You can do this by strengthening your hair using a protein treatment . Protein treatments help to make your strands more resilient by filling in any gaps or holes you may have from damage . Aphogee 2 step protein treatment is professional strength and will whip your hair back into shape . For those who are protein <p> For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a more gentle DIY protein treatment using avocado . Always follow up a protein treatment with a moisturizing deep conditioner. - I personally love Essations Naked Honey &amp; Almond Moisture Whip Conditioner . <p> For those who are n't  big fans of protein you can skip this , but NEVER skip out on deep conditioning . <h> Step 3 : Section your hair <p> Never underestimate the ability of a leave in conditioner ! They help to make your more manageable and make the process go by smoother . You Be Natural Smoothing and Defrizzing Creme is a leave-in that doubles as a heat protectant , which is for sure a win , win . <h> Step #5 : - Thoroughly detangle each section <p> Always detangle from the ends of your hair and work your way up . Use a wide tooth comb and to further smooth things out use a paddle brush . Work on each section one at a time and secure with the butterfly clamps when you are done . <h> Step #6 : Blow dry section by section <p> Take your time and blow dry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the blow out the better the outcome . The Conair Pro Silver Bird is a pretty awesome and inexpensive blow dryer that I use to have . But this is one that 's used in natural hair salons . Its so good at what it does that you most likely will see results using the medium heat setting . Do n't  be afraid to try using the cool air setting either . You can use the cool air to remove the excess water from your hair first and then follow up with medium heat to stretch your hair. - Make a point to avoid harsh heat exposure as much as you can . <h> Step #7 : Flat Iron <p> Use a light- product like Chi Silk Infusion to protect each section and flat iron . Work in very small sections . This helps to eliminate the need to pass over the hair too many times . When you work in small sections you may only need to go over the hair once , at the most twice . Although it sounds tedious , this part really does n't  take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look . <h> Step 8# Caring for your hair afterwards <p> To preserve your style you can wrap your hair or you can do pin curls using bobby pins at night . You do n't  want your hair to be too weighed down so as needed you can apply a lightweight oil to your hair like jojoba or sweet almond oil . When your hair starts to revert do n't  immediately grab for the flat iron ! To reduce frizz- roller set your hair . I was able to smooth my hair out using You Be Natural Smoothing and Defrizzing Creme on the ends of my hair and then rolling my hair with- magnetic rollers ( avoid sponge rollers ) . 
@@24772721 @4772721/ <h> 5 Ways to Get Past a Growth Plateau 43055 @qwx243055 <p> Almost all of us have experienced the frustrating growth plateau . You feel like your hair is flourishing , then finally it reaches a particular length and it seems to be stuck there . In the vast majority of cases , we need to reevaluate what we are doing to counteract length retention . <p> Yes , genetics determine your hair length but if you find yourself stuck at chin length hair , for example , this in all likelihood is NOT what you are genetically capable of . <p> Here are some areas that you should check to get your hair back on track : <h> #5 Not Trimming Your Hair <p> There are so many differing opinions on this topic . There are some that say you can go 6- months to a year without trimming your hair to people who say you should trim your hair every 4 to 6 six weeks . One thing is for sure , you should be trimming your hair . When you do not trim your hair , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and if you have put trimming off way longer than you should have , it will appear as if your hair is not growing . Splits cause the hair to look thinned out and scraggly so even if you have retained some hair length , it will be hard to notice . Find a good balance to fit trimming into your schedule that is customized to you. - Every 4 to 6 weeks is probably way too often for most people while waiting 6 months is definitely pushing it . <h> #4 Going Overboard with Heat <p> I am definitely not an anti-heat person , because when used correctly it may make it easier to grow your hair . Stretched hair equates to less tangles , more styling options and aids in making it more easy to retain moisture for longer periods of time . You can read more about this in 3 Reasons Why I Started Blow Drying My Natural Hair . <p> The problem is when we use at home tools , it is relatively easy to fry your hair . You may have the heat setting up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a section way too many times . This leads to dryness and split ends if you are a frequent user of the blow dryer or flat iron . Try to go long stretches without using heat and when you do use it make sure you are taking the necessary steps to avoid heat damage . <h> #3 Over Manipulation <p> Detangling , combing and styling all contribute to some degree of damage . This- is why we want to reduce the times we manipulate our hair and when we do manipulate it , we need to be as gentle as possible . Rule of Thumb : If detangling or styling hurts you are doing it wrong . Try creating a low manipulation hair regimen . <h> #2 Do n't  Forget to Moisturize <p> There are many reasons that you may have forgotten to moisturize . Maybe you have been protective styling for a while so your hair has been out of sight and out of mind . If you forget to moisturize , - you are essentially letting all your hard work go to waste . Make sure you give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oldest portion of your hair and need the most TLC. <h> #1 Your Consistency <p> Hair types on the more fragile side of things need consistency otherwise you will see your hair quickly succumb to neglectful treatment . What enabled me to retain as much length as I did was consistently practicing protective and low manipulation styling . I started straying away from this and doing more wash n go styling , which was fine . However , I ended up not using a protective/low manipulation style at night which caused tangles and split ends within a matter of a couple of months . This led me to the decision to cut my hair to start anew . Moral of the story here is , if you find something that works , stick to it . 43053 @qwx243053 43054 @qwx243054 <h> Comments <p> This with correction Supersedes my first comment ! . ; Now over and over I search and read the same thing for myself to see if I 'm missing any thing on hair grow and if I 'm doing anything wrong. , well I do n't use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with water or a leve in treatment by in infusion 23 , I take Multi vitamins and biotin and I protect my ends , I use proteins every 6-8 weeks and my hair after four years is still at its same length or grew only 2 or 3 inches , so it must be genetics in my case but however when I was younger my hair was much longer bra strap Length and I 'm just trying to get back there , so does now does age slow things down ?

Leave-in conditioners are- just that . Read more about the L.O.C Method <p> While textured hair as a whole may need help with moisture , those of us with kinkier strands may crave it even more .

A leave-in conditioner can provide an extra layer of protection to the hair as you prepare to heat style . Used along with your heat protectant of choice ( I like grapeseed oil ) , a good leave-in will help keep your hair from getting too dry and straw-like once its blow dried . <h> Refreshes Hair <p> When mid-week rolls around and I need to freshen up my look but wash day is n't for a few days , I like to use my leave-in to perk my hair up a bit .

When used just before your favorite butters , puddings or gels , itll add just the right amount of moisture to give those products an extra kick . Your hair will have great shine and your curls will pop ! <h> Awesome for Detangling <p> Of course , with all of the goodness we find in leave-in conditioners , they are great detanglers ! The water , oils , butters , etc contained in our faves help give the hair extra slip and help us work through tangles with ease . <h> Do You Really Need It ? <p> Well , the short answer is- maybe not .

As long as its water-based and contains nourishing oils and other goodness , I will use it in place of an actual leave-in conditioner . So , consider what products you 're using on wash day .

If- its already super soft and manageable right out of the shower , then maybe you wo n't feel the extra step in necessary .

Here are three simple heat-free ways you can extend your blowout ! <h> Twist It <p> When looking to extend your blowout , this is probably the easiest thing you can do . I , for one , use this method to keep my hair stretched with just the right amount of " poof " once I take my twists down . For my length and density , I do about six or seven loose twists- just enough to keep my hair from tangling up on itself but not too many to give a whole lot of definition as with a twist-out ( since that 's not what I 'm going for ) . Best part is , its super quick ! <h> Braid It <p> The effectiveness of braiding is along the same lines as twisting-- keeping the hair detangled . The difference is you 'll get even more of stretch with this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may take a little longer to do than twisting but if you 're a person who needs those- roots to stay intact ( I 'm personally not too fussy about that ) , then braiding/plaiting is a good way to go to help extend your blowout . Again , the same rule applies- you just want a few large plaits to get that stretch and keep the hair detangled . <h> Bun It <p> After a long day of big , fluffy hair realness , simply grab your detangling brush or a styling brush and pull your hair back into a low bun . Bunning your hair will give you an even further stretch than braiding . Plus , when its time to take it out , its just the one thing you have to worry about rather than a bunch of twists or braids . Just unravel , shake and go . If you notice an indentation where your scrunchie or ponytail holder used to be , just mist- VERY lightly with water and brush it out . <h> Quick Tip : <p> Common with- the humidity of summer , your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the course of the day and might cause some tangling . In this case , you may find it helpful to apply just a little leave-in conditioner or your moisturizer of choice before manipulating the hair so it is easier to manage .

Today , I 'm sharing just three simple ways you can use this sweetener in your current hair care routine . <h> What Are the Benefits of Honey ? <p> Honey is a natural humectant . This means that it has the ability to attract moisture which can be great for textured hair which craves moisture . When the temps are pretty moderate to high , humectants draw moisture from the air . When the temperature get cooler and drier , though , theyll draw the moisture from your hair . You may find the best results if you use it during the transitional months when the weather is not too extreme as in the winter when your hair may dry out or in the summer- when your hair might swell and ruin any definition you 're trying to maintain . <p> Honey also gives hair a great shine plus it has antioxidant and antibacterial properties which help keep the scalp healthy and promote growth . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see great results ! <h> As a Rinse/Spritz <p> This is a great final rinse to restore dull hair to shiny curls and coils ! <p> 1 tsp honey <p> 4 cups warm water <p> Mix the honey into the warm water . Pour it over your hair or apply to using a spray bottle for easier coverage . DO NOT RINSE OUT ! This comes after you have shampooed your hair . You can even add your favorite essential oil for some extra hair benefits and fragrance . <h> As a Pre-Poo Treatment <p> Just mix the honey and olive oil together and apply to your hair in sections until completely coated . Cover with a plastic cap for thirty minutes . Shampoo , rinse , style . <h> As a Deep Conditioner <p> With the added benefits of banana and coconut oil , this deep conditioning mask will not only give you moisture and shine but itll also strengthen your strands !

Whether Dax , Royal Crown or Blue Magic , your mom slathered that stuff onto your scalp and pigtails after every wash . Now that you 've gone back to wearing your natural texture , its suddenly the worst thing you could put on your hair . But is it really bad for your natural hair or is it all a bunch of fluff ? <p> What causes all the fuss is the stuff that grease is made of . <p> What 's in Grease ? <p> Take a look at the ingredients on a jar of grease . One of the first ingredients ( if not THE first ) is usually petroleum or one of its forms like mineral oil or petrolatum . The first thing that probably comes mind when you hear petroleum is Vaseline . Think about how we use Vaseline <p> We might put it on a cut or bruise on our skin . Why ? Because it creates a barrier that helps protect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contain these ingredients . Normally , the instructions are to apply it while our skin is wet . Why ? Again , the barrier . After we have moisturized our skin with water , the lotion will create a moisture barrier to help lock it in . <p> Thing is , what might make it good for your skin makes it bad for your scalp ! <p> What Happens When I Use Grease ? <p> - <p> The danger in using grease does n't  lie so much in using the it on your hair but what it does on your scalp . We said that the ingredients in grease mineral oil , petrolatum create a moisture barrier . Even though the scalp is skin on our heads , while that might be fine for the rest of our body , its not so cool for our scalp . <p> With that moisture barrier up there , nothing can get in , nothing can get out .

Some naturals still swear by it when doing certain styles because it gives them great definition . Should you want to go that route , here 's what I suggest : <p> ( 1 ) Properly moisturize your hair first ! - The same way we apply those lotions , creams or even petroleum jelly itself right out of the shower while our skin is still moist , you should , by all means , make sure your hair is properly moisturized . Whether you want to just use a leave-in conditioner on damp hair or some variation of the L.O.C. Method is up to you . <p> ( 2 ) Use as a sealant . Your grease will be the last step in your moisturizing routine to lock in the moisture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shaft. - Do your best to keep the grease off of your scalp and apply just to the hair . What some do is begin applying about an inch away from the roots to reduce the risk of it reaching scalp . <p> ( 4 ) Do n't  O.D. ! - As you relive your childhood years , DAX in hand , you may feel the urge to dig in and scoop out a healthy amount but do n't  . LOL ! Use a little at a time on each section of hair . Too much will cause a whole nasty buildup nightmare . <p> ( 5 ) Shampoo to wash it out . Even though you 'll follow my advice not to overdo it ( RIGHT ? ! ) , you may still want to use a regular shampoo to make sure it washes out well .

I usually blot out excess water with a t-shirt or towel ; I then add my leave-in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wet hair <p> After towel drying with an old t-shirt , I let my hair air dry for a bit , before I begin to twist my hair . ( If you wait to twist , your hair has more surface to dry . Also , by adding products that lock in moisture you slow down your drying time . Get more of the water out before you lock in moisture and voila ! Shorter drying time ! ) <p> Do n't  Cover Your Hair <p> It sounds intuitive , but not everyone takes heed to this very important step to get your natural hair to dry fast . How often have you quickly covered your hair after twisting ? After twisting your hair , delay putting on your bonnet for as long as humanly possible . If you have a satin pillowcase , you can forego the bonnet altogether . <p> If you 're worried that your twists wo n't dry by morning , then pull out your dryer to help your hair dry faster . ( My daughters let me blow dry my hair for a whole five minutes on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a diffuser made all the differencelol . ) If I had the time I would have spent about 2o mins under hooded dryer but the blow dryer was a quicker option . <p> If Your Twists Do n't  dry , Handle with Care <p> Suppose you follow all of these hair drying tricks and your hair still is n't dry . Then , handle with care . As long as it is not wet or humid outside , you can still have outstanding results . The key is to make sure you do n't  disturb the curl as you unravel the twists . Even untwisted , your hair can finish drying and no one will be the wiser because your twists will have definition . In fact , on Sunday , portions of my hair were still damp . But as you can see from my pictures , my twistout was still defined . <p> There you have it , my magic tricks to get your natural hair to dry faster .

Theyve read or seen advertisements leading them to believe that it is a natural way to create bountiful curls , loosen tightly coiled curls , and make hair more manageable . Its also portrayed as a safer way ( less damaging ) to " elongate " natural curls and still remain natural . Is it true ? Is it safe ? Can it be used to help in the transitioning phase ? Here are some answers to some frequently asked questions about texturizers . <p> Texturizer - defined as a mild form of a relaxer , applied to the hair for a brief amount of time ; usually applied with a comb through method allowing tightly coiled curls to be given a " more desirable , loosely defined " curl pattern . - <p> " Texturizers are completely safe . " <p> The myth that texturizers are completely safe is left open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ingredients as a relaxer . The difference that make them " safer " , is that they are usually milder , containing more conditioners and oils. - BUTAt the end of the day , its a relaxer . The fact that it is required to stay on the hair for a shorter amount of time than a relaxer , also has companies marketing them as safe , but , if you leave it on too long , curls will be- completely straightened with no chance of them reverting back . Safe ? - Unlikely . <p> " Texturizers are the perfect way to elongate curls . " <p> Texturizers are the perfect way to elongate curls . This is not a lie . But , hair will no longer be natural , it will be chemically treated . Also , because the curl pattern has been loosened , hair strands will be finer , losing some of the denseness to the hair . So , if you are looking for products to elongate your curl pattern , but not completely and permanently alter them , try products such as : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desired look of elongated curls , without the permanent stain of chemically treating your hair . <p> " Texturizers allow curls to be more manageable " <p> The reason most find their curls to be unmanageable is because of the multitude of curls patterns that are intermingled on one head . Texturizers provide curl uniformity , thus making curls more manageable . But , keep in mind , the curl uniformity is caused by chemically treating the hair , and can not be undone . It is my suggestion that if you fight to manage your different curl patterns , try utilizing the twist out or braid out methods , finger coils or flat twist outs . <p> " Texturizers give great , beautiful bountiful curls " <p> In my opinion , though texturizers may loosen curls , it does n't  create huge bountiful curls . It may allow for better definition , but most have experienced limp curls . Now it does make for a great foundation for setting on rods or rollers , but the curls themselves may come out a bit " lifeless " . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been said that texturizers make the transitioning process easier . This is a catch 22 . Though it makes the transition easier by loosening the texture , putting less stress on the line of demarcation , it makes for a longer transition because you will still have to transition out of the texturizer in order to be completely chemical free- doubling your transitioning phase . - - Also , remember that because the curls have been elongated making for an " easier : transition , - as the new growth comes in , you will have to reapply in order to have matching curl patterns . Otherwise , you will be left with two different textures , a line of demarcation ( where the different textures meet ) , defeating the purpose of texturizing . Also , you risk overlapping the previously treated strands , which can lead to chemical damage and/or straighten hair . <p> When I first went natural , I would get stopped 4 to 5 times a week with the question : " What did you put on your hair to get the curl ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I would tell them gel or water or a combination of sorts . They would reply " No , I mean what did you use to get your curls ? ? " Puzzled , I 'd ask what they meant by the question , and theyd make reference to some type of texturizer . I 'd laugh and reply , " You cant buy curls in a box " . This is the biggest misconception. - BUT- its important to know that if your hair is loose or does n't  have a curl pattern , such as those described as having " z " pattern textures , and you apply a texturizer , it is n't going to deliver a curl pattern , but quite the opposite . I have seen this happen , and the results are horrifying . The hair usually ends up bone straight and/or limp , leaving the individual having to Big Chop or transition all over again . Texturizers merely loosen tightly coiled curls , but do n't  supply curls to already loosened wavy or undefined " z " patterned hair . <p> It is so very important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of texturizers .

The worse thing ever is to experiment with your natural hair , only to have to start over . I went through the whole , " Oh its just hair " , but when you have to start from scratch , its a different story .

@@24772771 @4772771/ <h> How I Grew Back My Balding Edges 43055 @qwx243055 <p> Prior to transitioning to wearing my natural hair texture , I wore hair extensions and weaves to give my naturally fine hair a much thicker appearance . My favorite go-to styles were braids ( that I usually wore in a bun on top of my head ) , weave ponytails , half wigs , full wigs you name it . <p> My favorite style of choice was the " quick weave " , which consisted of laying the hair down with a thick gel , allowing it to dry until it was completely hard , and attaching the weave hair to my own hair using a specific hair glue . I cringe just thinking about the process and the unnecessary damage that was done to my hair in my own ignorance . <p> It was n't long before I started to notice that my already fine hair was starting to become even more thin , stringy and rather dull . Not to mention , balding edges My edges had become so thin that you could see right through to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the same sad state . Hair extensions and wigs can be a great protective styling option , but it is vital that you maintain and care for your own hair at the same time in order to prevent breakage , hair loss , damage to the scalp , and even possible scalp infections . <p> I really did n't  have much of a hair regimen and I knew that my missing edges were the direct result of the constant pulling and tension to my hair when styling . After incorporating some changes and a few vital steps to my hair care routine , I noticed a tremendous improvement in the overall health , appearance , and abundance of my hair within five short months . My hair growth was attributed to the following steps : <p> 1 . Putting an end to Unnecessary Tension One of the first things I did to help restore my damaged hair was to stop any type of styling that added unnecessary stress to my hair . Braids were causing way too much tension to my edges because of how tight my stylist- would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first week after having my braids installed , very fine , white bumps would cover my hairline . <p> 2 . Taking the Time to Properly Care for Hair When I was ready to remove my quick weaves styles , I would sometimes just pull on the hair tracks and release them instead of using the appropriate hair glue removal solutions . I would even saturate the hair wedge with conditioner and remove the hair while in the shower . Removing hair weave or any type of maintenance that requires excessive tension on the hair should never be done while the hair is wet . Natural hair is most fragile when it is wet and is more prone to breakage and other types of hair damage . I never slept with my hair covered and I had an " out of sight out of mind " kind of attitude about my hair . Slowly , I started incorporating small steps such as regular deep conditioning , detangling properly , using the right hair tools , trimming away split ends , and throwing out any snagged hair accessories that could potentially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vitamins that Promote Hair Growth I tried taking Biotin after hearing that it could help with hair growth , which it did , but I soon noticed that it was n't just the hair on top of my head that increased in growth . I started asking around in different hair care forums and found that I was not alone . Many other women ( and men ) noticed that after taking biotin , bodily hair started to increase rapidly . Because I suffer from a health issue called Polycystic ovary syndrome ( PCOS ) , I was already having issues with unwanted hair growth and taking full on Biotin was just not helping with my situation at all . Instead , I decided to try a hair , skin and nails multivitamin that also contained Biotin , but at a much lower dosage in a daily multi-vitamin . <p> 4 . Scalp Stimulation to Encourage Growth Every other night I would give myself a 5-10-minute scalp massage , focusing mostly on my hairline and the middle of my head . Some nights I would use a mixture of oils to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my hair in a satin scarf or satin bonnet before bed . By morning , the oils were absorbed by my thirsty strands and never weighed my hair down . I used my light oil mixture for regular scalp massages , and my heavier castor oil mixture 2-3 nights prior to wash day . <p> 5 . Using Organic and all-natural Oils to Boost Hair Growth There are many oils that claim to help increase hair growth , eliminate hair loss , and promote a healthy scalp . Maintaining a healthy scalp is also essential to hair growth . I used two mixtures for my hair , a light mixture and a heavier mixture that I would use closer to wash day . The lighter oil mixture contained the following : <p> According to the University of Maryland Medical Center , these essential oils may help to stimulate new hair growth when used in scalp massage .

Hair loss is an issue that a lot of people are uncomfortable talking about . Hair loss is nothing to be embarrassed about . There are many options and solutions available when dealing with thinning hair , balding or any type of hair loss issues . Some issues can be easily fixed simply by changing your hair care practices . There are other factors that may be contributed to hair loss as well such as poor eating habits , allergic reactions to hair care ingredients , prescription medications or other health concerns .

Even those who dry detangle add some sort of slip to the mix . So what actually is best ? Combing wet hair or dry hair ? <p> The solution is a medium point , which would be damp hair . Although natural hair is definitely more easy to comb through when its wet , it may not be the best idea to manipulate your hair when its at its weakest point . All hair for that matter is in a weakened state when it is soaking wet and it is stronger when it is completely dry . However detangling hair that is completely dry is definitely not the route you want to go because it is brittle . Detangling damp hair gives you the balance you need to easily manipulate your hair with ease and reduce breakage . <p> " It can take as little as 33 grams of strain to break an African hair type while wet ( about 43 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about a 100 grams for these hair types dry ) , which means any slight pulling can cause hair loss !

For some people detangling their hair when wet is just easier . <p> However , as someone with a 4c hair type for me detangling my hair when soaking wet makes absolutely no sense for me ! Yeah I can detangle when its wet alright but then when it has fully dried it will shrink right back up no matter if I braid it for stretching or not . For me , I do personally prefer to work on damp hair as I find it easier for stretching purposes . I also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ touch it I get more broken strands all over my hand . <p> One thing that I have learned from my research is that while there are differences among hair types they all share the fact that when hair is wet it is not as strong as when it is in its dry state .

Depending on where you get your information from ( everyone seems to have their own variation ) the method is a lengthy process . For the first week the steps must be completed everyday and any drying product ingredients like sulfates or alcohols should be avoided . After the first week of using the Max Hydration method , the regimen is to be implemented every three days and it is highly advised that you do not go past 5 days without implementing the method . <p> To say the least , the process seems to be a bit of a- commitment . Here is a brief overview of the - Max Hydration Method- regimen : <p> Night <p> Step 1 . Clarify with Baking Soda/ ACV rinse Step 2 . Deep condition/GHE , may add light oils to scalp . You may use thermal heating cap or steam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Day <p> Step 2. ( continued ) Rinse out DC and detangle in morning . Step 3 . Clay ( you can also sleep with the clay overnight instead rinsing it out in the morning , and just do warm condition or steam/thermal heatcap/ hooded dryer for step 2 ) Step 4 . Leave in . Hair should be soaking wet , no matter how you go about doing it . Step 5 . Gel/ Oil to set into style ( no glycerin or coconut oil ) <p> Apple cider vinegar rinse . You do a 1:1 ratio of apple cider vinegar with water in an 8oz applicator bottle . Apply to hair in sections from tips to the root , and on scalp . Let it sit in the hair for 15- 60 mins before rinsing . Note you can choose to only do the acv for 15 mintues , like the BS , but the longer you can leave it the better . <p> This regimen seems to be working for at least some people , as the websites testimonials page is filled with videos from YouTubers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> I definitely believe that this method is plausible , as my 4c hair takes on an entirely different look when I have successfully moisturized it and I retain the moisture I put into it . <p> The photo on the left is me with no products in my hair and the photo on the right is me with loads of moisture and Eco Styler gel .

But I do , its just that when moisture gets involved Afro hair takes on an entirely different look , the problem that many of us face is keeping that moisture locked in . <p> There are two downsides I see with the Max Hydration Method : the time investment and keeping your hair in a wet state for a prolonged period of time . <p> " Do the steps in the exact order , and do not skip any step , or it will not be as effective .

Well maybe not your life , but it certainly will make your 4C hair so much easier to work with . - Looking back I wish I knew this information because it would have made my transition to natural hair a whole lot easier . Use these tips and transform your 4C - hairs health and manageability : <p> 1 . This goes for most natural girls , but especially for 4C ladies never comb your hair when it is bone dry . When you do this you are asking for breakage galore , not to mention a tough time even getting through your hair . It is best to comb damp hair but if you like to style your hair while it is dry , always put in a product that will give you tons of slip before you comb . <p> 2 . Avoid using small tooth combs for detangling 4C hair . This is just asking for it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finger detangling your hair for a more gentle approach . <p> 3 . Try not to use brushes on 4C hair at all . To new naturals this may sound funny , but yes try to eliminate your usage of brushes . Brushes rip and pull at your hair causing splits and breakage . If you must use a brush for your edges or your nape , use a boar bristle brush , infrequently . Brushing will thin your hair out so fast ; every time I see someone over brushing their hair it makes me cringe a bit . Girl you are losing so much hair doing all that ! <p> 4 . Wash n gos may not be for you , especially if you like curl definition . For many 4C ladies this " shortcut " will not be the route you want to take . If having no definition is cool with you , then by all means try it ! However , be prepared for massive shrinkage and matting with your 4C hair . For many of us ladies with 4C hair Wash n gos just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like this : <p> You may be better off doing a faux wash n go , which I will discuss in a future upcoming post . <p> 5 . You do n't  have to do anything special to 4C hair when you go to bed . - Put your hair in a sloppy ponytail or very chunk twists , the goal is just to prevent your hair from matting. - If you go to bed with only a bare bones fro , overtime , your hair will become matted , tangled , and the end result will be breakage . <p> 6. - For some of us wet styling just does n't  work on our 4C hair ! In fact , it may cause tangles , matting , and severe shrinkage . When you air dry your hair first you will get a more stretched out result for your style and there are less tangles to deal with . <p> 7 . You can use water to moisturize your hair . The trick to using water on 4C hair - is do not saturate it ; lightly spritz it ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not enough . In some cases , you may need just a touch of water to restore the balance . <p> 8 . Choose 4C friendly hairstyles that you can stick to for at least a week and that do not require tons of daily styling . The less you have to manipulate your 4C hair the better . Lately my puff has been my go to style , because I simply moisturize when needed and go . <p> 9. - Have a trouble spot ? The center of my head seems to be the driest and kinkiest texture . If you can relate , the best way to deal with this is by applying more moisture and conditioner to this area . Also try to lay off heat in this area and when you do use it use a lower setting to avoid dryness . <p> 10 . Conditioner is your friend ! Try to deep condition 4C hair as often as possible .

@@24772796 @4772796/ <h> What Every Natural Hair Regimen Needs and How Often 43055 @qwx243055 <p> The proper natural hair regimen , designed for your hair in particular , is necessary to truly enjoy healthy , manageable hair . To develop one , it takes time and patience ; it can also be expensive , which I- call the trial and error phase . <p> There 's a few must have necessities that will help you develop a healthy hair regimen , no matter the hair type/texture . The following list is what I suggest with each consultation provided in the salon : <h> Non-drying , Moisturizing Shampoo <p> With every regimen , implementing the use of a non-drying , moisturizing shampoo is important . Not to be confused with a co-wash , a moisturizing shampoo should consist of one ( 1 ) OR no sulfates listed within the first four ( 4 ) ingredients of the product . <p> Also , moisturizing shampoos generally contain no lauryl sulfates , as they are very harsh on the hair . Laureth Sulfates are milder cleansing agents , so if it contains ANY sulfates , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shampoo that will gently cleanse , but also replenish moisture lost from styling , as well as restore proper pH levels . A shampoo that restores and maintains proper pH levels helps keep hair at its natural level , keeping the hair healthier and balanced . <h> - Clarifying Shampoo/Agent <p> Now this may seem to contradict all that was discussed in the paragraph above , but , contrary to popular belief , every- regimen needs a clarifying agent whether a shampoo , clay , vinegar rinse of sorts or combination of two . <p> Why ? you asked- well , if you are constantly using moisturizers and oils and never clarifying the strands and scalp , it can lead to breakage , clogged pores , balding , dandruff , and an array of other scalp diseases . <p> I 've seen many go to Dermatologists and return with no answers , because it is a merging condition that is n't necessarily an issue other than product build up . It can become very problematic , leading one to believe they have a fungus , yeast and other infections of the scalp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( at least ) you can avoid a manifestation of scalp issues . If you 're still experiencing hair loss , you may need one of these 5 things . <h> Deep Conditioner Moisture and Protein <p> Depending on the texture and porosity , you will need one of these more than the other . But , each are equally important to a regimen . Natural hair tends to be drier , typically , and will always need a moisturizing deep conditioner . <p> Soft , fine textured : - leaning towards a protein conditioner may yield more benefits ( if hair tends to feel " mushy " or snaps easily ) . 1 ) Alternating between a moisturizing deep conditioner and- a protein treatment once a month , will help strengthen your hair . 2 ) IF AND ONLY IF . hair still feels " mushy " , add protein conditioner to moisturizing conditioner on the day you would do a stand alone moisturizing deep conditioner , still- alternating with stand-alone protein treatment . <p> Porous : - - utilize- one that is marketed for smoothing . This will help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Non-Porous : - choose- a moisturizing conditioner , but sitting under the dryer will maximize benefits of conditioner by raising cuticle and allowing product to penetrate . <p> Protein treatments are as needed to keep hair balanced . Though some textures need it more than others , it is still a major factor in developing a great hair care regimen . <h> - Moisturizer <p> Not to be confused with an oil , it is so important to have a moisturizer that best fits your hair type . Some moisturizers may be heavier than others , which can be a good thing or bad depending on hair type . But it is important to find one that supplies your hair with the proper level of moisture . Depending on texture and porosity , one may need to moisturize once a day or once every 3 days , but I do n't  suggest going more than 3 days without moisturizing in some sort of way . If utilizing a protective style , moisturize before styling , and then again once a week until style is removed . <h> Sealant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sort of sealant in order to maximize moisture retention . Seal the hair after the application of your moisturizer . <p> Porous , Medium to coarse : - if the hair is porous , I 'd recommend a butter that contains shea butter . <p> Non-porous , Medium to coarse : - I 'd suggest- a heavier sealant/oil such as castor oil or argan oil mixed with coconut oil . Also , once applied , try sitting under dryer to assist in the penetration of product . <h> Other Scheduled Maintenance <p> Trims . I recommend that everyone get a trim AT LEAST once every 6 months for those who utilize low manipulation styles . If you manipulate your hair often with twist outs or styles that requires a lot of manipulation , every 3-4 months is best to optimize length retention and rid hair of split ends caused by over manipulating . <p> Tangles , knots , split ends , dryness , are just a few signs that its time for a trim . But you can read more about that here . <p> **Side Note**- Contrary to popular belief , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regimen that consists of high-quality shampoo , deep conditioner , and moisturizer , you can skip the Leave In Conditioner . Leave in conditioners were formulated to reinforce the hair with strength and moisture , and to assist most naturals with detangling , but I have found that if you detangle hair while a conditioner is on , follow a regimen that best suits your hair type , texture and porosity , you can typically skip the leave in and proceed to your moisturizer . <p> Now depending on hair type , porosity and texture , your regimen may require a few other necessities . But , based upon my experience , the items listed above are the key- necessities to developing a great hair regimen to achieve and maintain healthy hair . If you feel you need more , please , by all means , visit a professional who may be able to consult with you and address other hair care matters . 43055 @qwx243055 <h> Related 43052 @qwx243052 <p> Exhibiting an interest in hair as an adolescent , Markeita S Pruitt believes she was destined to excel in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she has diligently worked to perfect her craft .

But I blow dry my waist length hair without heat damage . <p> For the last five years , my natural hair journey has reached its planned destinations sooner than I expected . For instance , I reached waist length hair in 3 years and tailbone length within 5 years . With my continued research , studying , and listening to my hair , I use effective hair care methods that my hair likes and I apply these methods consistently . <p> Many marvel at my hair growth accomplishments and I am surprised at what I achieved . Truth be told , many could reap the same rapid healthy hair growth success if they just focus on their hairs health . <p> As a healthy hair growth advisor for natural hair , most are amazed that I use heat on my hair because in the natural hair community there are some that believe that using heat on hair is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you use heat wisely and effectively can grow very healthy and very long hair . <p> Heat could be a problem for someone whose hair is dry , weak , damaged , and/or brittle . I do n't  recommend any heat to be used on hair that fits any of those descriptions . If you are unsure whether or not your hair is healthy , here are 5 Ways to Know Your Hair is Healthy <p> In order to have success with using heat , the hair must first be in good standingresiliently strong and full of elasticity . Hair that 's properly moisturized can withstand heat to a certain extent . Applying heat every week may not be healthy , in my opinion . <h> Use Heat Sparingly <p> Being consistent with my healthy hair care regimen ( visit my hair page for details ) makes my hair more tolerable to heat . I co-wash ( meaning I wash my hair with a cleansing conditioner or wash with conditioner ) and deep condition my hair once a month and faithfully moisturize my hair lightly throughout the week with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wash day , any worries regarding adverse issues with heat are at bay because of how I build moisture and seal it into my strands . <h> Condition , Condition and Condition <p> Co-washing , deep conditioning , and using a leave-in conditioner are a must for heat users as they keep dryness away . Throughout my journey , I 've washed with Pantene Co-Wash , Cantu Co-Wash , and Aussie Moist Conditioner . These co-washes moisturize , detangle , soften , and make my type 4a , normal to high porosity hair shiny . <p> I love ORS Hair Mayonnaise as a deep conditioner/protein treatment because it does exactly what it promises . It moisturizes and strengthens damaged and hair from within the hair shaft and helps mend split ends while providing incredible body and shine . It contains egg protein and olive oil for additional moisturizing ability and is infused with essential oils and organic amino acids for added strength and shine . Parnevu and Curls Blueberry Bliss are leave-in conditioners that bring my hair back to its natural balance leaving it vibrant and strong . <h> Use Heat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always apply a heat protectant . I like One n Only Argan Oil . It aids in protecting hair against excessive heat from styling tools . Basically , it prevents moisture from being stripped from the strands by the heat . Even though I use a heat protectant , I still blow dry hair using low heat and cool air setting . I use the cool air near the ends because its the oldest part of the hair which makes it more susceptible to damage . <h> Use the Right Hair Dryer <p> For the last couple of years , I 've used my simple yet dependable Conair Cord-Keeper 1875W Purple Dryer that I purchased for less than $20 dollars . But Tamara of Natural Hair Rules uses the Chi Deep Brillance Hair Dryer . There 's not anything super fancy about it . The features are a retractable line cord with push-button control , ionic conditioning , 2 heat/speed settings with cool air button , and folding handle . It gets the job done right . I like it because it did n't  come with the attachments and I am able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drying which is a plus against heat damage . <h> Work in Sections and Detangle With a Brush <p> I blow dry my hair in small sections ( 12 sections ) because it is manageable and I use the tension method along with a Denman-like brush for a better-detangled stretch . I extend my hand a section of hair and blow dry . Slowly brushing through that stretched hair helps remove any small tangles that might have been missed during the detangling process . <p> According to research , it is important to blow dry about six inches away from your hair . Avoid blowing dry in an upwards motion , since this leads to more damage . Blow dry in a downwards motion . Lastly , never keep dryer blowing in one spot . Your dryer should move about evenly . <p> I like blow drying my hair with the tension method ( see video below ) because the stretch will last longer and my hair wont revert back to extreme tight coils . With my hair stretched like this , I am able to trim and style hair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure I moisturize my hair with a water-based cream during each week . Dabbing a little bit of cream does not cause quick reverting . It will give your hair an ample amount of moisture needed to remain resilient and thrive as it slowly reverts throughout the month to its curl pattern . <p> Flat ironing is used even more sparingly than blow drying . I flat iron my hair up to 4 times a year . The longer my hair gets the more limitations I apply to keep my hair in good standing . Healthy hair is top priority . <p> To conclude , sporting hair in protective styles like updos , buns , and high ponytails assist in length retention which supports growth . 43055 @qwx243055 <h> Related 43052 @qwx243052 43059 @qwx243059

Its one of the easiest things you can do with your hair and is great for any occasion ! <p> If your bunning skills are less than perfect , here are four different techniques to help you create a beautiful bun on natural hair . <h> High ( Ninja ) Bun <p> Whether you call it a Ninja Bun or Top Knot , this seems to be one of the most popular buns of them all and my personal fave . I have my own unique- method of- creating this look but I really like this one by Lyvona . She takes the term Top Knot literally in this simple tutorial ! <h> Low Bun <p> The low bun is a beautiful- alternative which pulls the hair back and off of the face instead of up to show off more of your features . Its a great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or any type of headpiece or hair jewelry on the big day . <p> A low bun might be the best option if you have shorter hair as Naturally Nellzy demonstrates below . Because you 're laying the hair flat onto your head , you kinda have gravity on your side to keep those shorter hairs laid and in place ! <h> Textured Bun <p> There are a number of ways to pull off this look . " Textured " can refer to the actual texture of your own hair ( if its long enough ) or the synthetic hair you use form your bun ( like Marley Braiding Hair or some other kinky/curly texture- like this look ) . But it can also refer to the texture you give the hair before you actually form the bun by braiding or twisting it . <p> While classic buns are great on their own , twisting or braiding the hair can add some interest to the bun when you 're looking to do something a little different or want to create some volume . here 's a quick how-to for you ! <p> here 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ low bun . I 've done this quite a few times and its always a hit . So easy ! <h> Donut Bun <p> If you want a more uniform look or are just bun challenged , the donut bun is for you ! <p> By using a pre-made " donut " - either store-bought or handmade using a sock- you can easily create a perfectly round bun without much fuss . Simply put your hair in a puff or ponytail , slide the " donut " on , secure your hair over the " donut " with a headband and pins and your done ! <p> Watch this step-by-step from EiffelCurls with her take on the low textured bun using the " donut " . <p> These looks can be achieved whether you keep your hair in its fully natural state or straighten it . Best of all , you do n't  have to have super long hair or even medium-length hair to achieve them . With all the affordable synthetic hair on the market and the right technique , you too can rock a bun ! <h> Transitioning ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the perfect protective style to keep your ends tucked away and healthy as possible until you 're ready to clip them off . As I transitioned , the low bun was my go-to style not only because it was simple but it also meant I did n't  have to deal with those annoying , straggly relaxed ends for a while . I highly recommend incorporating buns into your style rotation if you 're still transitioning to natural ! <h> Are you a bun wearer ? Which technique is your fave ?

Color can definitely dry out your natural hair , so it 's imperative that a moisture regimen is in place . <p> So , you get your hair colored . Now what ? I always recommend visiting a professional when it comes to chemical services . But , if you chose to do it at home or allow a buddy to assist , there are a few things to implement that will ensure hair remains damage . <p> #1 Never apply to dry , damaged hair <p> I know I should be discussing after care , but , I must mention that you should never color your hair if it is dry , damaged , suffering from breakage or split ends . Color will only increase these issues and will lead to severe damage . <p> #2 Increase deep conditioning <p> After every color , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This will help replenish any protein or keratin lost during the coloring phase . I suggest mixing a protein conditioner and a moisturizing conditioner , applying and sitting under the dryer . The moisturizing conditioner will keep hair from feeling hard or dry after the use of protein ( protein treatments can leave hair feeling dry or brittle depending on brand ) . If after applying color , hair feels weak , apply deep conditioner once a week until condition improves . <p> #3 Increase the amount of times you moisturize your hair <p> If you are accustom to moisturizing your hair once every 3 days , then increase to once a day . If you are use to once a day , then bump it up to twice a day . Increasing your moisture will ensure that your hair does n't dry out and remains balanced . Increasing is to be done if the hair appears drier than usual . Proceed with the increase until hair porosity has return to normal/balanced . Once balanced , return to your original regimen to ensure that you do not over-condition or over-moisturize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Sometimes , immediately after a color service , the hair will feel rough due to holes in the strand or raised cuticles from being over-processed . If this happens , you can attempt to use a semipermanent or demipermanent ( typically darker ; not blonde or gold ) color as a filler " which can help equalize porosity . There are also protein fillers on the market ( for those not wanting to change the color ) that fill the holes created from the depletion of natural protein and keratin during the coloring process . **NOTE : : This is a temporary fix , and will have to be reapplied as hair begins to show signs of distress . <p> Coloring your hair , no matter the shade or levels of lift , does n't  have to be damaging if done correctly and cared for properly post color service . If doing at home , implementing the steps above will save a lot of stress and help in the long run by helping maintain healthy hair .

If you have never had color , blonde is achievable without bleaching . Search out a professional who can achieve this result without the need or use of bleach .

Use these styling tips for low porosity hair ! <p> There was a time where I thought I could not set my hair in twists , braids , or rollers after it had been freshly washed . I would spend time loading up my hair with product that I thought would keep it moisturized and after hours of hard work , I was repaid with crispy shriveled up- results . Worst of all , I would set my hair in the evening and by the next morning , it still was somewhat wet , which led to frizz when I would undo my set . <p> This is because I have low porosity hair and if you are experiencing anything like what I described above , you could possibly have low porosity hair too . <p> When you have low porosity hair it is a challenge getting moisture into your strands because your cuticles lay flat. - What ends up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ top of your hair ( which is why it many cases your hair seems like it takes forever to dry ) . The good news is , once you successfully get moisture into your hair , it retains really well . <p> Fear not ! There are simple solutions to getting the style results that you desire if you happen to be a low porosity natural : <p> Style damp hair and avoid styling saturated hair <p> It is beneficial to style damp hair rather than saturated hair to avoid breakage . When your hair is wet , it is in its weakest state while on the other hand , dry hair is more of a challenge to manipulate ; damp hair provides the perfect medium . For the low porosity natural , it is even more critical that excess water be removed to avoid wet head the next day . <p> When you plait your hair , it already enables it to retain more moisture than if it were left out , so if you do really large sections it may not have enough breathing room to dry the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are on the lighter side <p> When you use products that are too heavy , they end up creating a layer of buildup and they do n't  absorb into your hair . Its no wonder that when I tried ORS Styling Foam that it worked better than the vast majority of butters that I have tried , the butters were simply just too heavy for my hair . The foam was light enough to penetrate and gave me the hold that I needed . <p> Try products with humectants <p> Especially in the winter , you may need that extra moisture so if you use a butter , go with one that contains a humectant . For some reason , humectants like glycerin get a bad rep but for the low porosity natural they can be heaven-sent . They help the moisture get inside your strands rather than just laying on top of it . In- humid weather , they can make your hair feel sticky because it can lure moisture from the air into your hair . Otherwise humectants work amazingly well with low porosity hair .

Color and other chemical services break down the natural protein and keratin in the hair , creating gaps and holes in the strands that leaves hair feeling rough . So , what you have lost , can be replenished with keratin and protein enriched conditioners . My go to is Redken Extreme Strength Builder and/or Aphogee 2 Minute Keratin Conditioning Treatment .

@@24772839 @4772839/ <h> 6 Steps For Repairing Breakage and Dry Winter Hair 43055 @qwx243055 <p> The harsh winter environment robs you- of moisture and can wreak havoc on your hair strands . When you touch your hair its dry as a desert and you see broken off hairs falling left and right . You moisturize and you moisturize , but nothing seems to work . You try protective styling , that does n't  help the situation either . Many of us have been there and I know personally its not fun . Do n't  worry it happens to the best of us . Here are six steps that can reverse your ordeal before things get really bad : <h> Step #1 Give your hair a boost of protein <p> Especially if you 're noticing a significant amount of breakage this indicates that your hair is in a weakened state . Filling in those gaps , tears- and holes will drastically improve your situation . Use an effective protein treatment like ApHOGEE Two Step Protein Treatment- and Aphogee Balancing Moisturizer , which you can find on Amazon or your local beauty supply store @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Heat <p> After doing a protein treatment for some people things can get a bit dry , which is what you definitely do not want . Follow up with a good moisturizing conditioner ( not a cheapie rinse out ) and deep condition using heat for 15-30 minutes . You can use a sit under dryer or the convenient Hot Head Microwaveable Deep Conditioning Cap . Yes , you can always deep condition without heat , but you will maximize your efforts as it will aid in penetrating the hair shaft . <h> Step #3 Apply a Leave In Conditioner- <p> All too often we underestimate the power of a good leave in . I 'll admit that even I have neglected this step , but trust me it matters . A good leave-in will leave your hair more moisturized , improve manageability , shine and make styling more easy . Some leave-in conditioners double as a heat protectant so if you can find one like this , it will be even better for those who decide to stretch your hair using a blow dryer . <h> Step #4 Stretch Your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to fully embrace shrinkage and keep your moisturized like The Maximum Hydration Method , if you 're not a wash n go type of girl , stretching will be the preferred option . <p> here 's why : when your hair is stretched it tends to be easier to moisturize and retain moisture longer . This is because the moisturizers , butters and oils have an easier time spreading throughout your stretched strands rather than when they are coiled up . You may not face this problem in the spring or summer because the air is n't as dry , but in the winter it can get pretty ugly . Its okay to use heat to stretch your hair , just make sure you take the proper steps to protect it this is addressed in 7 Myths About Heat &amp; Natural Hair . <h> Step #5 Its Probably Time for a Trim <p> 9 times out of 10 if you saw a great deal of breakage you have some splits to go along with it . Rid yourself of split ends and this will only improve the situation . Split ends cause more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a weak point on your strands . The breakage you have been seeing can also be coming from split ends that decided to break off on their own . <h> Step#6 Choose a Style That Will Make it Easier for You to Retain Moisture and is Gentle on Your Strands <p> While protective styles do help with retaining moisture make sure you choose a style that is n't to stressful on your strands . A simple bun may be the perfect option or try a low manipulation style like a rod set . Depending on the condition of your hair it could- be the perfect time to try out flat iron styles , as straightened hair will retain moisture longer and obviously will tangle less . Any style that will help you to retain more moisture and eliminate tangling issues will do .

Is it possible that the method could actually work , despite that science says that hair can only grow -+ inch per month ? Let 's find out <p> What is the Inversion Method ? <p> Inversion refers to being in a downward or upside-down position . The inversion method uses the idea of being in an inverted state for a period of time while stimulating the scalp to increase hair growth . The method takes place over a period- of seven days in which you warm your favorite plant-based oil ( coconut , avocado , olive , castor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every night before bed for a maximum of 4- minutes .

If all of the oil has been absorbed into your hair , you can continue t style as usual . <p> Those who are suffering from certain medical conditions such as high or low blood pressure , heart-related problems , detached retina , migraines , ear infections , spinal injury , osteoporosis , glaucoma , hernia , and history of stroke are strongly urged not to attempt the inversion method .

Increased blood flow to the hair follicle allows for your scalp to receive more nutrients that will ultimately encourage hair growth and discourage issues that could hinder your hair growth .

Unfortunately , the more you practice the inversion method the more your body will become accustomed to being in an inverted state .

There has n't  been any substantial scientific evidence to support the theory of the inversion method working for humans , however , various studies done on rats has shown that blood flow is essential to hair growth . The Journal of Clinical Investigation published a study on rats that proved that hair growth decreases if blood vessels are blocked or constricted . According to the Pacific College of Oriental Medicine , massaging the scalp will strengthen- the root of the hair and increase the flow of nutrients to the hair follicle , which will enhance and promote faster hair growth . <p> Tips to Remember : <p> Do not- saturate your hair with oil only apply lightly to the scalp <p> The Inversion method should be done no more than once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for any longer than 4 minutes at a time <p> If you have any health concerns consult your doctor before trying the inversion method 43055 @qwx243055 <h> Related 43052 @qwx243052 <p> Kiianah Johnson is a naturally inquisitive freelance writer , editor , and graduate student from the DMV area with a Bachelor 's degree in English and Journalism .

Because you must first twist/braid your extensions and THEN twist , the process will take longer than your typical extensions . It will also require more hair , thus making them both more expensive and heavy . <p> This style can be accomplished using yarn , kanekalon braiding hair , or synthetic marley hair . The cheapest option is kanekalon hair at $3-5 per pack ; the most expensive option is marley hair at $5-6 per pack . <p> To install , first start with stretched hair. - You can either add braid or twist extensions . Please keep in mind that you do n't  want to install them too tight . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may cause unnecessary tension on the scalp . <p> After the twists/braids are installed , you can wrap each twist/braid with the hair . ( This is the most time consuming step of the process. ) - Upon completion of your locs , you can burn the ends to prevent them from unraveling. - The entire process can take 10+ hours . <p> Because your hair is tucked underneath the locs , you should not have issues with your own hair frizzing . But since your hair is tucked away , you should take extra care to properly cleanse and moisturize your hair . Protective styling will not protect your hair if you neglect your hair . 43053 @qwx243053 43054 @qwx243054 <h> Comments <p> I plan on doing twists with kanekalon hair , letting it rest , then wrapping it with some marley hair .

@@24772870 @4772870/ <h> I did the Big Chop What Happens Now ? 43055 @qwx243055 <p> Making the decision to big chop is a huge step in embarking on your natural hair journey . Now that you 've taken the first step to a wonderful hair experience , here are a few pointers on what to do next . <p> 1 . Develop a Simple Hair Maintenance Routine After big chopping , many naturals are shocked of the new hair texture . Caring for natural hair is a lot different from caring for relaxed strands . You may find that your hair needs a little more TLC than before and will actually require you to learn about your new hair texture in order to keep it healthy and maintained . Do n't  go overboard with buying all types of hair products . Start simple and perfect your routine to suit the needs of your hair . Stick to the basics such as a sulfate-free shampoo , moisturizing conditioner , leave-in conditioner , a plant-based oil for sealing , and your styling product of choice . <p> 2 . Keep your Hair Moisturized You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than your relaxed hair . Natural hair needs moisture and if it feels brittle or hard instead of soft , then you need to work on restoring moisture to your hair . Doing so helps to prevent potential breakage as your hair grows . The best moisturizer for your hair is water , followed by a sealant such as a light oil , moisturizer or leave-in conditioner to lock in the moisture . Try using a moisturizer where water is the very first ingredient . Keep a small spray bottle handy filled with water , and a light oil such as jojoba , sweet apricot oil , coconut , or almond oil . <p> 3 . Know- the Porosity of your Hair Knowing the porosity of your hair is key in determining the types of products your hair will need . Porosity is simply defined as the hairs ability to absorb moisture . A simple strand test can help you determine your hair porosity level . Simply drop a strand or two of your natural hair into a cup of water . If the hair immediately sinks under the water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ top of the water for a minute or so before sinking may be considered as having normal porosity , and hair that sits atop the water and simply will not sink may be low in porosity . Hair with a low porosity repels water and moisture and is also prone to build-up . <p> 4 . Remain Confident in your Decision Although natural hair has now become more globally accepted than ever before , you may still notice a few glares and stares from the naysayers . Do n't  let negative comments or looks get to you , you are beautiful and you should n't let anyone convince you otherwise . You may even find that family members may not be supportive of your decision . The more confident in you are in your decision , the more others will respect it . So hold your head high and strut your new look ! Do n't  be surprised when the naysayers start asking questions about how to care for their hair as they watch your hair flourish . When I first started wearing my teenie weenie Afro ( TWA ) in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why I would make such a drastic decision to cut my hair " so short " . It was n't long before several of my coworkers also decided to stop relaxing their hair and guess who was their go-to person for advice ? My point exactly . <p> 5 . Learn to Two-Strand Twist Even if you do n't  know how to braid or style hair , two-strand twists on natural hair can transform into some of the most gorgeous natural hair styles you will ever see ! Even if you ca n't braid or cornrow ( like myself ) , your hair can still be fabulous in styles such as twist-outs , twisted pin-ups , half up/down styles , a frohawk and there are so many more styling options . Learning to style your hair will also save you tons of money from salon visits and will also help you achieve a relationship with your newly discovered hair texture . <p> 6 . Do n't  Waste Money on Expensive Products Do n't  waste your money on products that may do absolutely nothing for your hair . There are lots of products @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Take the time to learn your hair before splurging on hair products that are not suited for the needs of your hair . Start with a basic sulfate-free shampoo . There are several that you can find for under $8 such as Alba Hawaiian Coconut Milk Shampoo , OGX Renewing Moroccan Argan Oil Shampoo , or Shea Moisture Coconut &amp; Hibiscus Curl &amp; Shine Shampoo . You will also need a moisturizing conditioner for natural hair such as Herbal Essence Hello Hydration or Pantene Truly Naturals conditioner . You can find several leave-in conditioners for under $10 such as Kinky Curly Knot Today ( also great as a detangler ) and my personal favorite , As I Am leave-in conditioner . When it comes to styling products , be sure to read the label to fully understand what the product is promising . Choose your product based on the needs of your hair and if the label description matches with your styling goals . <p> 7 . Do n't  Waste Time ( and money ) trying to Create a " Curl Pattern " One of the biggest taboos when it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ product that will create curl definition . Not at all . It is likely that as your hair grows , the texture of your hair may change and there may be very little to no curl uniformity .

Natural hair textures will vary and no two hair patterns are the same , they may be similar , but you will not and never have the same " curl " pattern as the next head of natural hair . Embrace the texture you were given and instead of wasting time and money on products to create a curl pattern , try learning what techniques work best for your hair specific hair texture . 43055 @qwx243055 <h> Related 43052 @qwx243052 <p> Kiianah Johnson is a naturally inquisitive freelance writer , editor , and graduate student from the DMV area with a Bachelor 's degree in English and Journalism .

But I 'm not a fan of buildup , flakes and breakage . ( If you have experienced breakage or hair loss around your edges , here are some tips for regrowth . ) Ive hated gel since the finger waves of the 90s . You remember them . People would rock them for weeks : - dried , flaky , crispy , and damaged . Can you sense my disdain ? So whether I 'm rocking a puff , an updo , or a twist out , I rely on safe methods for taming edges . With that said , here are the steps I follow to tame my edges : <p> The first step in laid edges is water . I always spritz my hair lightly with water first . - The key is to slightly dampen the hair , but not make it too wet . - Remember : natural hair forms to whatever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slightly dampened hair , it will form into a sleeker style . <p> Use a Hair Butter , Hair Milk , or " Alcohol-Free " Gel <p> Many people believe that the only way to get sleek edges is to use gel . - Although gel will provide the most hold , you can also try other products as well . - If you choose to - use gel , try an " bad alcohol-free gel " that wont dry your hair . ( Good , fatty alcohols - stearyl , cetyl , cetearyl , laurel , myristyl , - behenyl provide moisture . But avoid drying alcohols like ethanol , propanol , propyl , isopropyl , and isobutane . ) Ecostyler Gel is a favorite among women with natural hair . <p> As an alternative to gel , I use hair butter .

Another option , for women with finer textured hair , is hair milk . - To hold my one-year olds hair , I use hair milk . <p> Once you spritz your hair and use your product of choice , the final step is to tie your edges down with a silk or satin scarf until it dries . - If you only slightly dampened your hair , it shouldnt take more than 20 minutes for them to dry . Because I am a busy mom , I usually do my hair first then get the girls ready . Then , I either take off my head tie before I leave the house or before I get out the car at work . <p> With these three steps , you can smooth your edges without damaging them . It is important to note that you should remember not to pull your hair too tight , nor should you wear the same style the same way over a period of time .

We will discuss these two loc methods and how to care for your hair once loc 'd in two parts . - The first part will describe palm rolling pros and cons . <p> " Palm Rolling " <p> Palm rolling technique can start with single strand or two strand twists . Coarser hair textures with a tighter curl pattern can hold either very well . But for finer hair textures and looser curl patterns , the double strand twist is the best option . <p> Step 1 Twist Hair and Allow Time to Loc <p> After the hair is twist or rolled in two strand twist or single coils the next few weeks low or no manipulation is recommended . - That means no shampooing , no styling , and no combing of any kind as you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in kinky twists for a little longer than usual . If you do shampoo your hair seek the help of - your stylist to fix any twists that have come undone during the shampoo process . <p> Step 2 Once budding occurs allow stylist to retwist or train roots <p> During the matting process , the hair begins to form small buds . These buds are typically felt in the middle of the loc first . Once the buds form , you 'll return to your stylist so that he/she can twist the roots training your new growth to lock up with the existing bud . <p> Step 3 Repeat Step 2 Every Two Week or so <p> To maintain consistency in your loc as it solidifies and matures allow your stylist to re-twisting and to keep the locs clean . This translates into an appointment every two ( 2 ) weeks for optimal care of the locs . <p> The Con of the Palm Rolling Loc Method- <p> With palm-rolling , you must be careful . The constant re-twisting and twisting too tight , can weaken the strands and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clip , if you twist it in the same direction long enough , you can actually break the paperclip . Your hair is the same . So when starting locs using this method , be sure your stylist creates a base for your loc that is strong enough to support the weight of the loc as it gets longer . - It is really important to section locs around the hair line large enough to support the loc and prevent breakage that can occur as a result of the constant manipulation of locs . Especially around the hair line which is more susceptible to breakage during maintenance and styling . Although breakage in palm rolling can be an issue there are ways to repair locs by a process called marrying of two locs . <p> Because Palm rolled locs are more susceptible to breakage , I recommend Interlocking . - We will discuss in part two interlocking and the pros and cons .

@@24772892 @4772892/ <h> Hair Porosity : LCO vs . LOC Method for Lasting , Layered Moisture 43055 @qwx243055 <p> Moisture retention is one of the biggest healthy hair concerns for many naturals . Thanks to science , the quest for the perfect thirst-quenching product is a bit easier now than it was before . Turns out , for most of us , there is no one-item wonder . Sealing in moisture takes at least two steps , and in some cases , three . Wondering which routine will work best for you ? Well , that involves knowing your hair porosity . From there , you can better determine whether the LCO or LOC method gives you lasting , layered moisture . <h> Hair Porosity : The Highs and Lows <p> There are a number of resources that can help you determine your hair porosity , or its ability to absorb moisture . Remember that porosity is a sliding scale that ranges from low to normal to high . For the purpose of reviewing each moisture method , well stick with low and high porosity . <p> Low porosity hair has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harder to penetrate . These strands appear smoother under microscope , and are usually very shiny to the human eye . <p> Highly porous strands appear coarser with open or raised scales , which easily allow moisture in or out . This type of hair is prone to frizz and tangling , especially in humid weather . <h> Layered Moisture : Liquid , Cream , Oil ( LCO ) Method <p> Layering products on the hair allows us to control how much moisture is absorbed and how quickly it evaporates . Hair can be styled wet or damp , with heavy or light liquids , creams and oils . <p> Let 's examine how low porosity strands respond to the LOC method . When saturated with a liquid , low porosity hair will slowly absorb and retain just the moisture it needs . Once a cream is added , it will absorb the water content from the product , leaving the rest to coat and seal its strands . Then , when oil is applied , the- two outermost layers will mix and form a thicker barrier to protect the strands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this cream and oil mix can leave your hair weighed down and greasy . <p> High porosity hair , however , often responds more favorably to layering creams and oils . When wet , it quickly takes in more liquid than it needs , which causes swelling and lifting of its scales . Once a cream is applied , it absorbs a lot of the product and leaves only a little to coat and relax/smooth the cuticles . The right oil will mix with the cream layer and create a lighter , more flexible coating . <h> 3 Natural Hair Products That Decrease Hairs Porosity <h> Liquid , Oil , Cream ( LOC ) Method <p> Similar to the above routine , the LOC method can leave low porosity hair weighed down with product buildup . To prevent this , consider using a lightweight oil opposed to thick , penetrating ones like coconut and olive oils . Jojoba , sweet almond and argan oils will coat the hair while still allowing strands to breathe . Then , when a cream is applied , hair will feel smooth and slick without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protect high porosity hair by sealing its cuticles and preventing hygral fatigue . This is damage that occurs from repeated expansion and contracting of hair fibers . After penetration , a small amount of the oil is left to coat the hair . When a cream is applied , what 's needed is absorbed and what 's left acts as a protective coating against environmental elements ( evaporation , damaging sun rays , etc . ) . <h> Which is Best ? - Well <p> That depends on your preference . For low porosity hair that 's also very thick , layering may not cause product buildup . If it does , try eliminating one layer at a time to see which provides maximum moisture ( LC or LO ) . For hair that 's highly porous but not fatigued , then LCO is your way to go . And if not ? Try LOCing in moisture with oil first to kiss dry , dull , lifeless hair goodbye . 43055 @qwx243055 <h> Related 43052 @qwx243052 <p> Formerly known as NatrulyCourtney , I 've been slightly obsessed with big , textured hair for nearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all things crowned pop culture .

" The most popular replies are , <p> *Coconut Oil <p> *Shea Butter <p> *Glycerin <p> Now , while these listed ingredients can be equally beneficial to your hair , they are not stand alone moisturizers. - - Essentially , these are popularly misused natural hair products . <p> The listed ingredients are actually oils . Oils are lubricants used to restore natural oils that may have been stripped during shampooing and/or styling process , and also to seal . But , if not used in conjunction with a really good moisturizing leave in or cream moisturizer , they can seal in dryness and repel any moisture from entering the strands of the hair . The greatest confusion comes from the fact that shea butter in its raw state is creamy or solid . But , this is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liquefied . Now if they are mixed with other essential oils and a moisturizing component , known as- a humectant , then it now has the ability to retain moisture . Water is also a good source of moisture , - so mixing with water is a better option . <h> Glycerin and water combined is popular because glycerin too is a humectant . But , if not immersed in moisture , it will actually draw it from the nearest source . This explains why glycerin and water or glycerin laced products work better in the humid summer as opposed to the dry winter . <p> The humidity in the air , breeds an environment of moisture , allowing it to absorb the moisture from the air into your hair . But , if used in drier conditions , it will actually suck up the moisture in your hair . Be careful with glycerin as its effectiveness is based upon its surrounding conditions/environment . <p> 4 ) When purchasing products , read the ingredients . I love spending time in the store reading ingredients and determining which products are true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so for example : if it is said to be moisturizing , yet lists mineral oil as the 2nd ingredient , or alcohol , avoid at all cost . <p> Mineral oil gives the illusion of moisture , but quickly evaporates , leaving you to have to use more frequently .

This means the only source of actual moisture is water . So if you want moisture , know that water is the #1 ingredient . All other additives aid in two ways : by either causing the absorption of more water ( humectants ) or by trapping water inside of the cuticle ( sealant ) . <p> Humectants , of which glycerin is one , are generally not fats as they must be water soluble to attract and hold water molecules . This can be both positive or negative depending on whether or not the water content in your hair is less than that of the environment . Sealants , on the other hand , must be water insoluble in order to prevent attraction of water molecules and eventual diffusion outside of the hair . This means you cant seal your hair and expect to see an increase in hair moisture . Long story short : humectants help you attain moisture while sealants help you retain moisture .

How does one attain softer hair ? Here are six things that may help ! <h> Hydration <p> One primary way to achieve softer hair is to- make sure that you stay properly hydrated . This is where it all begins . Our hair follicles/scalp feed off of what we take in our bodies which is why it 's so important to drink plenty of water in addition to eating healthy if you 're trying to attain healthy hair . Sufficient water intake is the first step towards hair that is soft and manageable . <p> Steaming is another way to give your hair just the right amount of hydration it needs . The heat opens up the hair cuticle allowing the water to penetrate the hair . In my experience , my hair is immediately softer after this process ! <h> Moisturizing Cleansers <p> When cleansing your hair , refrain from using products containing sulfates which can strip the hair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Use a moisturizing shampoo or cleanser ( like a shampoo bar or clay wash ) and follow up with lukewarm or cool water to rinse. - These types of cleansers are usually pH balanced and contain ingredients that will moisturize and soften the hair .

Remember , oils and butters do not moisturize and soften hair on their own . The key is moisture ( liquid/water ) first , then emollients to retain it . <p> In between washes , if necessary , use a spray bottle to lightly spritz your strands with water and follow the same procedure of layering your moisturizing product and sealing . <h> Low-Maintenance/ Protective Styles to Retain Moisture <p> Protective styles are stressed so much because they do a fantastic job at- helping the hair retain moisture .

Divide hair into about 5-6 sections ( more if your hair is shorter ) and clip . One by one , massage a sufficient amount of extra virgin coconut oil into the scalp and gently work it down the hair shaft . Coconut oil lifts dirt , nourishes , and helps minimize moisture loss when shampooing . Briefly detangle with fingers , remove shed hairs , and twist each section .

Nobody wants a little pea sticking upside they head . We love our buns to look full and have that perfect form . <p> There are ways that you can pull this style off on shorter to medium length hair and with some options there is n't even a need for added hair . <p> Here are three ways for achieving that juicy plump bun we all love so much : <p> The Sock Bun <p> The sock bun is a popular technique for pulling off that perfect form and fullness . You can purchase one at your local Target or - if you love online shopping you can even purchase some on Amazon that come in a variety of sizes . Before using your sock bun , you will want to make sure your hair is moisturized and smoothed out . You can use a product like Eco Styler Gel to give your hair a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leave in or moisturizer . Gather your hair into a taut ponytail and once your hair is nicely laid you can add your sock bun . You can now smooth the hair over the bun and secure with a ponytail holder . If you find that you have some stray hairs neatly pin them in place with some bobbies . The video tutorial below gives an excellent overview of the process : <p> High Bun Using an Elastic Headband <p> This is perfect for hair that is approaching medium length or is already at mid-length . I use to use this trick all the time . The method is simple . You will want to stretch your hair out some and smooth it out . Once you have gotten your hair nice and smooth gather your hair using a large cotton stretchy hand band . The trick to this is you are going to wrap this around your head twice and then gently slide the band up . This gives your hair the illusion of a full ponytail puff which you can also rock as a style . To get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bun by pinning in place with pins going around your whole ponytail until you have finished . At the 3:13 mark of the video below you can see how to achieve this style : <p> Rather than using a sock bun you can use your scrunchies to add the fullness you desire . However , for the first ponytail you make you will want to use a thin elastic , which give you more hair to work with . Then you will layer a thick srunchie/headband around the ponytail which ends up having the same effect as the sock bun ( its pretty much a homemade one ! ) . You then smooth your hair over the scrunchie with a thin elastic and pin any stray hairs in place . Skip to the 1:52 mark to see this styling option . <p> And there you have it , three ways to get a full bun with no added hair required ! Have you tried any of these options before ? I know I am dying to try the sock bun option , as I have one and have not used it yet .

The normal wear and tear your hair incurs on a daily basis leading to breakage and split ends , can definitely put a halt how much your hair retains its length . Hair grows without a doubt , but it is the constant breakage that stops you from seeing the fruits of that growth. - Thats why most women choose to make protective styling or low manipulation styling an integral part of their natural hair care regimen- to retain their hairs health and length . <p> Protective styling and low manipulation styling- are often used interchangeably . Most women think they are one in the same when they are actually pretty different . So , what 's the difference between protective styling and low manipulation styling ? <p> The idea is that as your hair is growing , the length of your hair is being retained due to less breakage and split ends that can incur through daily manipulation of the hair . The long terms effects ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between short term and long term styles . <p> Often do not have to be redone on a regular basis . <p> Protects- your hair from the unnecessary breakage that comes with everyday styling and upkeep by keeping your ends tucked away .

Once the technique is perfected , you can just pineapple for bed , and shake &amp;- go in the morning while still maintaining the curl definition ! <p> Photo Credit : CreateHer Stock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and protective styling are similar is that they both help to retain length . Though protective styling seems a bit more " protective " because your ends are tucked away , low manipulation styling helps with length retention as well because it eliminates the- use of- combs , brushes , or other tools to help maintain your hair on a daily basis . You 're manipulating the hair less , hence the name " low manipulation , " which leads to more length retention . <p> Length retention with protective styling helps maintain length simply because your ends are completely tucked away , eliminating dryness that leads to split ends and breakage .

I could n't help but cringe. - Never mind the fact that the commentators usually had less than desirable hair and that 's me being nice. - It is yet another reminder that we STILL- do n't  know the basics of black hair care .

So as you envision- young children sitting in between the legs of their mama , as they get their hair combed , it is important to remember just how fragile our hair truly is . <p> Combs Cause Mechanical Damage <p> Because our hair is so fragile , it is important that we treat our hair with tender loving care . So if you are combing your hair , you should not hair snap , crackle , and pop . Nor should it sound like a rake . If you hear this , think mechanical damage . Every time we handle our hair , we add to the wear and tear on our hair . For length retention , it is important to limit that damage . <p> Some people have actually thrown out their combs and decided use their fingers as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ included use their fingers to remove major detangles. - Whenever I handle my hair , I always start with my fingers . If I wear a style where my hair needs to be done daily , I solely use my fingers . And when I detangle on wash day , I use my fingers first . If you 've never tried finger detangling , try it and see if it works for you . <p> If you MUST use a comb , remember to use a wide-tooth comb like a shower comb . An even better option is a seamless comb ; since they have no seams , they do n't  snag the hair . ( They are as close to fingers as you can get . ) Also , whenever you do use a comb in your hair , comb from end to root . Also , make sure there is enough " slip " so that the comb can glide through the hair . <p> What are some other reasons for women with natural hair to ditch their combs ? 43055 @qwx243055 <h> Related 43052 @qwx243052 43058 @qwx243058 43053 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So I 'm 3 weeks in to natural hair and so far so good .

How much of this is standard ? <p> Also when you say comb from end to root , what does that mean ? I cant comb backwards . Any help would be appreciated = <p> ( last relaxer was mid 2013 , got blowouts until october , had senegalese twists from october until 3 weeks ago ( early september ) and I think all my hair is now au natural ) . <p> I agree .

It will help evaporate excess water and aid in stretching out your hair without drying your hair and scalp out . You do n't  - have sit under the hooded dryer or bonnet dryer until your hair has completely dry , you just want to stay under long enough so that your hair is at least semi-dry or set .

Its important to know that you have n't done anything wrong . Your hormones are still raging and what they what they are supposed to do as your body normalizes and the outward results are the changes you are seeing in your hair . <p> Shedding and breakage are the most commonly experienced issues postpartum . It is important to know that some shedding is normal and can not be prevented . This is because your hair did not she 'd as much during your pregnancy due to hormonal changes ; once those hormones settle back to normal , some of that hair must be shed . Shedding can be minimized , however , by frequent scalp massages and tea rinses . Both increase blood circulation to the scalp which creates healthy hair follicles . Tea rinses also help cleanse and add nourishment to the follicles . Healthy happy hair follicles tend to hold on to their attached hair root better . By proactively incorporating scalp massage 2 -3 times per week into your routine , this can be minimized . <p> Breakage is most often a symptom of dry hair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baby . This is best prevented by increasing moisture in your hair care routine . This can be achieved in different ways depending on your routine .

But if you are defiant like me ( or live in an area with dry heat ) , then you probably rock straight hair in the summer and fall too ! <p> That 's not the case for me. - So I have come up with these tips to keep your hair straight in humidity . <p> 1 . Set Realistic Expectations <p> If you live in a humid area and expect bone straight hair for two weeks , you will be disappointed . But if you expect fairly straight hair with options to set on flexirods as your hair begins to frizz , then you will love straight hair in the summer and fall. - If you prefer bone straight hair , then you should wait until the colder months to arrive to pull out your flat iron . <p> 2 . Avoid Days with High Humidity <p> Before I pull out my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the week. - In fact , I have the Curls app on my phone that indicates when I can expect frizzy hair . It let 's me know when there is high humidity/high dew point ; it has a curly girl with a smiley face ( no frizz ) or sad face ( frizz ) . - On humid days , the moisture in the air can plump up your strands and cause them to revert to their original curl pattern . Although we are transitioning from summer to fall weather , you will find that humidity is still high in the morning hours . Pay attention to the weather before you pull out your flat iron because you might have no chance of keeping your hair straight in humidity once it passes a certain point . <p> While your hair is straight , there will be humid days . On those days , opt for a bun. - In the fall , the average humidity is much higher in the mornings . Style your hair into a loose bun in the A.M. then pull it down when the humidity goes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saved me from frizz disaster on humid days ! <p> Use a heat protectant to create a barrier as you use high temperatures on your hair . Similarly , use an anti-frizz serum to create a barrier from the moisture in the air. - Most heat protectants and anti-frizz serums use silicones as a protective barrier. - On a daily basis , I prefer to use coconut oil as my protective barrier . In fact , I often use it to set my hair at night . The next morning , I have sleek frizz-free hair . <p> 5 . Do A Protein Treatment <p> Hair that lacks protein in the summer and early fall will result in frizz. - In fact , summer and fall are the perfect time to do more protein treatments . All of the moisture in the air can result in " mushy " , weakened strands . So it is important to pay attention to this , and do protein treatments as necessary. - Unlike winter , where protein treatments can result in dry , brittle hair , protein in the summer and early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you choose to straighten your hair . <p> If you are sensible unlike me you probably do n't  want to spend time with a flat iron when you know it will be difficult to maintain a straight style. - Instead , you can opt for a flexirod set , roller set , bantu knots , or curlformers . You can achieve a sleek , straight look without the direct heat . And if you hair frizzes out , its no big deal . <p> What are your tips for achieving straight hair in humid weather ? 43055 @qwx243055 <h> Related 43052 @qwx243052 43058 @qwx243058 43053 @qwx243053 43056 @qwx243056

When you hear the term wash n go , you think of getting in the shower , cleansing your hair , putting some type of gel product in your hair and going . <p> For SOME of us 4C ladies a wash n go is not doable. 4c ladies avoid the wash n go at all costs for more reasons than just - the aesthetics of the end result ; we get - breakage and matting - when our hair type shrinks- up to 75% not a cute and easy natural hairstyle . I do n't  know how you feel about that , but for me its definitely not cool . <p> What I have discovered is , that for me , I have better looking results working on damp or air dried hair and not soaking wet strands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hair when I start with soaked hair , my hair ends up being more dry , more tangly , and more matted . My damp to air dried hair absorbs products better , stretches more easily and styles nicely . <p> - So here goes my process for my Faux Wash n Go : <p> My hair is worn in a two strand twisted hair style that has stretched my hair and given me some curl definition . <p> I get in the shower , let enough water run through my hair to the point where it is damp but not totally saturated ( no shampoo or conditioner is used at all just water ) . <p> I use an ample amount of Shea Moisture Curling Souffle or alternatively Wonder Curl Get Set Jelly works just as well . <p> Again women who are able to do an actual wash n gos simply , wash their hair , - put product on it , let it dry and go . I am clearly not doing that here . <p> The set of twists that were in my hair are giving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only rinsing my hair ( which is why my shrinkage is n't so drastic ) . My hair also is n't getting very dry because my natural oils are not getting stripped since I am not stripping them with shampoo but only giving it a light rinse . - The jelly products that I like to use help to keep stretch in my hair , moisturize it , and further enhance the curl . So I basically - prep my hair before my faux " wash n go " and rinse my hair not wash it . <p> My faux wash n go ends up giving me the look of a wash n go and I am sure my hair loves it since it is quite moisturizing . The picture of me - with the ponytail and the big earrings is from when I used this technique a couple of months ago . A faux wash n go is also a great trick - when you are having a bad dry hair day . If you should find yourself with an old dried up twist out , do a quick rinse , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you have always loved the idea of a wash ngo but did n't  have the tresses to do it try my faux wash n go ; you 'll love it !

Braids do n't  " make " or " promote " hair growth instead they help with length retention . - Every time you style and detangle there 's a risk of breakage . - It just happens .

Small Braids Can Cause Thinning . I know they look pretty but the small teeny braids ( micros ) put a lot of tension on the hair .

I had dedicated countless hours writing , researching and more . But I was n't making a profit . <p> For some people money is n't a big deal . Clearly , I 'm one of those people because for years I never even expected financial compensation , not from the blog anyway . I had a marketing and public relations company that I was depending on for my bread and butter . That was my focus .

It was difficult explaining the significance of implementing digital strategies to people who just did n't  care . Being the youngest in the office I was called on to fix email accounts and other small tech problems instead . <p> I thought my experience in building a platform with millions of pageviews and impressions would create opportunities for jobs .

So , I chose a line and prayed it worked . Well , much to my surprise , the products worked ; so I thought . After a few months of usage , I began noticing my hair was very dry and began to break . I spent months trying to restore the moisture and revitalize my curls . My texture changed drastically and I thought I would have to chop off months of growth . So , desperate for a remedy , I begin researching products and was introduced to Qhemet Biologics . I visited a Houston local natural product boutique where I came across the Holy Grail of moisture replenishing/retention products " Amla &amp; Olive Heavy Cream by Qhemet Biologics . I went home to shampoo and condition my hair , and after allowing it to air dry before applying the product , and the results were phenomenal ! My love for this product @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personal arsenal , but in the salon as well . <p> Product Overview On the jar of Amla &amp; Olive Heavy Cream it states that it moisturizes and softens , very dry , coarse hair . I found that it works for all textures of hair , though the way used is determined upon texture . It nourishes the hair , leaving it softer , more manageable , healthy and full of life . It does n't weigh the hair down , but leaves hair conditioned and intense sheen . It is my personal preference to use this product once the hair has slightly air-dried , or has been towel dried . Doing so , has yielded better results as opposed to using on extra damp hair . If looking to winterize your regimen and make it acceptable for colder weather , adding this product will simplify the process by combating moisture loss due to dryer , colder conditions . <p> Styling Usage Upon , untwisting my hair , there was a noticeable difference in my hair 's moisture levels . It no longer felt brittle and dry , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ produced from one use had me sold ; proving to me it was everything it stated and more . When used on my twist outs , I not only got good definition , but the retention of moisture throughout the day was amazing . It has been my experience that twist outs can dry out throughout the course of the day , but with the Amla &amp; Olive Heavy Cream , I find that hair remains moisturized for days . Because a little goes a long way , I would suggest applying once every 3 days or so ; can be adjusted if you are experiencing drier hair . This Heavy Cream is very thick , so please be advised that applying in sections is the best method . This will ensure that one does not over use , and that it is being applied evenly throughout the entire head . I purchase this product for use in the salon , so if used sparingly , it lasts for quite some time . Nowadays , color is the growing trend amongst naturals . But , one will find that color @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Heavy Cream will deliver the needed moisture right back into the strands of your hair . It is recommended to use it as an overnight deep conditioning treatment , once a month if hair is color treated or is extremely dry . It is great for 2 strand twists , moisturizing hair prior to and during protective styling , and prior to rod/curl formers/bantu knot sets . By preparing the hair prior to styling with this cream , you will have prolonged moisture and softness , making hair less prone to breakage . <p> **Please Note : ** If hair is of a coarser texture or porous , it may be advisable that one use this product in conjunction with the Aethiopika Hydrate &amp; Twist Butter , as this will help seal in the moisture . <p> Key Benefits &amp; Ingredients Amla and Olive Heavy Cream does not contain any parabens , silicones , dyes , artificial fragrances , or mineral oil that can coat the hair leaving a buildup or film .

Our hair simply just does n't  like it , making a gentle approach the best way to keep your hair healthy . <p> Some of you who may be reading this may be thinking to yourselves right now , " I do n't  understand I do everything for my hair and yet I still have breakage " . If this is you I want you to strongly consider the way in which your hair is handled . <p> Kinky hair textures ( 4b and 4c hair types ) in particular do not respond well to frequent manipulation . The delicate structure of coils makes it particularly susceptible to mechanical breakage . So in addition to protective hairstyles you really want to make sure that you are reducing the strain put on your hair at all costs .

Hair types that can not withstand a lot of strain break even from the most gentle detangling session , which is why you may be seeing those tiny wisps of broken off strands laid out across your bathroom sink . You may want to try only combing once a week . Even now as I am wearing pressed natural hair I have n't bothered to pick up a comb . I opt for finger combing instead because it still does a great job and I am seeing little to no breakage . <h> Use the Tension Method <p> When you blow dry your hair avoid using the dryers with the comb attachment- <p> Some people can use the comb attachment with no problem , but for others breakage may comb fairly easy . A more gentle approach would be the tension method and making sure you are using a high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blow dryer the comb attachment simply is not necessary . Simply pull your hair for tension and blow dry from your root down to the ends section by section . <p> Stop messing around in your hair ! Believe me I know how tempting it can be . I love my hair too . However , your hair does n't  like it so much when you are always in it . So , do n't  over style your hair by trying something new everyday . Wear a style for a week or two , the longer you extend the time the better , and then change it up . Oh , and stop twirling your hair around your fingers . I know its addicting but try to stop . Your hair will appreciate the break . <p> When you improve the way you handle your hair you are sure to see a big difference in its health . Black hair flourishes inn low manipulation environments .

It consists of hydrating the hair with water or a water-based product which is your liquid , sealing in the moisture with oil and then applying a cream product to close the hair cuticle which prevents moisture loss . <p> Many women with natural hair have found great success with this method . This is completely understandable . It really makes sense . <p> I was using this method long before I realized there was a name for it .

Your cream in this instance should seal the hair cuticle or act as a sealant . - I personally use my leave in conditioner as my cream . <p> But let 's not get caught up on the word cream .

The purpose of the cream component is to seal or lock in moisture introduced from L &amp; O. <p> Natural products that seal and coat the hair are ideal .

I get the best styling results when I seal my ends with whipped Shea Butter and Aloe Vera Gel . But I usually only reserve Whipped Shea Butter for the winter months . <h> Do You Use The Loc Method ?

As always opinion is my own . <p> Q-Redew Hand-held Hair Steamer , $69.95 ( Amazon ) <p> Life-changing ! That 's it ! My review in a nutshell . But since Im sure you want an explanation , I 'll go further . First , I have to admit something . I do n't  like trying new products . For someone who writes about natural hair , I 'm a late adopter . I always watch and see , before I try . I 'm also cheap . If its not a necessity , then I look for a cheap alternative . My alternative for steaming has been the shower . When standing steamers became popular , I proclaimed that the shower is free . And with two kids under the age of 3 , I would n't be able to devote the time to sit under it anyway . ( My dryer sits in the garage . For deep conditioning , I exercise with a plastic cap on . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ praises of- standing steamers . <p> And then the QRedew came on the market . It was different , so I had to take notice . For the first time in a long time I had the itch to try something new . Review after review talked about how it could be used as a refresher , a moisturizer , AND a deep conditioner . Then people close to me said how great it was too . I was on a hair panel in September and " the gurus " also said it was great . Then Tamara said to check my mail . I opened up my mailbox and nearly passed out . And here I am doing the QRedew review . ( I like how that rhymes ) <p> Ease of Use The number one barrier for me is ease of use especially as a mom . The Q-Redew steamer is very easy to set up and use . You simply fill the water reservoir , plug it in , and wait for the red light to say it is ready . The bonus is you can attack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hair , you steam , add your moisturizers , and style that section . If you are interrupted , you can stop and continue where you left off . <p> Style-Refreshing Capabilities To refresh my styles , my go-to has been a water spray bottle and/or water-based leave-in conditioner . And although water is my friend , it is also my enemy . While water is moisturizing , too much of it can cause shrinkage and tangling . It is a problem Ive been battling with since I first went natural . With the QRedew Steamer , I can refresh my hair without adding too much water and causing shrinkage . For my thick , dense , elastic hair , this is truly a game changer for me . <p> The New Moisturizer of Choice So we all know that heat helps moisturizers get into the hair shaft .

I simply steam , add a leave-in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be forced to do a co-wash ; now I cheat with the QRedew . <p> The Great Detangler Detangling my thick , dense hair has always been - a major issue for me . I have procrastinated detangling to the point that I have a tangled , matted mess on my head . When I use the QRedew , it melts through tangles with ease . I used to struggle with my spray bottle and my Qhemet Biologics Cocoa Tree Conditioning Ghee when I retwisted between washes . But not anymore I also use it on wash day . I first steam my hair and then add my coconut oil pre- poo . When I detangle in the shower , it is a breeze . ( I 'm looking forward to less tangling - and breakage in 2014 . ) <p> Safer Way to Stretch Hair One of my favorite ways to use the steamer , is to stretch my hair .

I follow the MHM as someone earlier commented it is tedious but has been the best method for my lo po hair . If you are familiiar witth this method it does include ACV rinse/ and or baking soda conditioner rinse as its first step and a bentonite mud wash as its 3rd step .

I say this only to emphasize the fact that alot of issues that pertain to dryness or dull looking hair that does n't  seem to get moisturized may be due to not clarifying or washing off build-up effectively . If this part of your regimen is not done properly , all other steps that follow will be in vain . Your deep conditioning will not be effective . Nor will your leave-in and style product .

Just thought I share and save someone the problems Ive experienced . It would seem simple enough , but , the most common complaint in being natural is dryness . Since co-washing is held to biblical proportion when it comes to being naturalits not surprising that most naturals complain of dryness because they avoid shampoos in lieu of conditioners . I 'm all for co-washing , but , that hair has to be cleansed well for it to benefit from any moisturizing products that follow . So , incorporate it in whatever regimen you followtake note of how well your hair receives moisture after you shampoo .

Many agree there are no real disadvantages of naturality just challenges . One very big one that plagues us all is frizz especially in humid H-Town . Frizz can be a result of hair lacking moisture that may or may not be damaged . Here we will discuss tips to avoid frizzy hair that is lacking the adequate amount of moisture . As a result you will see smoother , softer and healthier hair . <h> No Poo Please <p> Your cleanser is your foundatios and the following product and/or techniques build upon it . If you are a regular reader , you know my rant about the benefits of Noo Poo . I wont go into detail . Co-wash or shampoo with sulfate , silicone , and alcohol FREE products. - When it comes to all your product try to keep it all natural <h> Condition Those Curls <p> Your conditioner is equally if not more important than your cleanser . Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ natural water-based conditioners and not just the ones that say all natural but read the ingredients . Your conditioner is usually the initial source of moisture besides water that you add to your hair so choose wisely . Look for moisturizing conditioners . <h> Leave In and Moisturize <p> Really , do I need to say more . One of the best ways to combat frizz caused by dryness is to use a good leave in conditioner . I use either Cantu Shea Butter Leave In Conditioner or Giovanni Direct Leave In Conditioner but it really depends on the style. - When it comes to moisturizers one of my fellower bloggers says the kinkier the hair the creamy the moisturizers needs to be and I agree . I recommend unrefined shea butter and/or coconut oil to help seal in moisture from water. - You can whip shea butter with a hand mixer and add an oil or aloe vera gel to maintain the whipped consistence . ( My personal recipe for Shealoe ) <h> Drip Dry <p> I 've said it before I will say it again , NEVER towel dry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ using a terry cloth towel . Drip dry , t-shirt dry or use a microfiber towel . If you have not invest in a hood dryer and you live in cold climates , please do . Drying your hair under a hood dryer is less damaging than blow drying with a diffuser and minimizes shrinkage as well . Partially or completely dry your hair before you step outside or go to sleep allows the style to set in place with smooth defined curls . <h> Carry a Spray Bottle <p> When I first heard this I thought it was a little silly but then I tried it . The benefits of regular misting with water are undeniable . Add your fav conditioner or oil and these benefits increase infinitely . Do n't  believe me ; try it . Not only will your hair look and feel better but your scalp will as well . In cool climates I only recommend misting if your going to be indoor it can have adverse effects in the cold. - Read more <h> Minimize Gel Use <p> When it comes to styling products if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep frizz at bay . Limit your use of gel because even the alcohol free can make hard and dry if used in excess. - If you must use gel opt for Aloe Vera Gel which moisturizes. - I encourage styling products such as Kinky Curly Curling Custard . Only a small amount is needed to achieve desired style . These products work with your conditioners and moisturizers to maintain soft and smooth hair . Also do n't  be afraid to try Hair mousse for curling hair . <h> Re-Twist and Tie That Head Up <p> Regardless of how you are currently styling your hair it is imperative that you cover your hair while you sleep with a satin scarf or bonnet . If you do n't  like to cover your hair invest in a satin pillow case . The satin is smooth and will not pull at the hair or absorb its moisture .

@@24773013 @4773013/ <p> Have you ever wondered why someones hair may look just like yours , but the products they use do n't  work for you ? Or why some people are more susceptible to breakage ? In this two part series , I 'll first break down hair typing terminology . In the second part , I will explain how you can use it to better understand your hair . <p> Black hair is very complex . No two heads of hair are alike . In fact , hairs on one head may not act alike . That is what makes us unique . But that also can be a challenge to fully understand . Our hair has various curl patterns ( 3C , 4A , etc. ) , textures , density , porosity and elasticity . It may seem very complicated , but here is the breakdown : <p> Curl Pattern <p> The is the most common system used to describe curl pattern . Essentially , most Black women have curly ( 3 ) or kinky ( 4 ) hair . The A , B and C refer to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to their hair has " G " or " Z " hair . There is no such thing . They are just using that to emphasize how " kinky " their hair is . ) The typing system is helpful with understanding how your hair may look if you copy a particular style . You can also infer that hair that is kinkier will be drier , because the tighter curl pattern makes it more difficult for natural hair sebum to reach the ends of the hair . You should not infer that kinkier hair is stronger . This is false . Hair texture determines hair strength , which I will discuss next . <p> Hair Texture refers to the thickness or diameter of the hair strand . Your hair can be fine , medium ( normal ) , or thick ( coarse ) . Fine hair is delicate with less protein structure and does n't  hold curls well . Fine hair is more prone to breakage , especially if it is also prone to dryness . Medium ( normal ) has more protein structure than fine hair , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a thicker hair strand , holds curls well , but it is less pliable than fine or medium hair . <p> Density <p> Density refers to the number of strands on your head . Those with low density hair are more likely to have issues with scalpy twists . High density means you have a lot of hair strands . When you refer to someones hair as " thick " , it is normally in reference to density . <p> Porosity <p> Porosity refers to how your hair strands retain moisture . If you are having issues moisturizing your hair , this is a very important concept to grasp . Low porosity hair is difficult to get moisture into the hair . Normal ( Medium ) porosity hair is fairly easy to get moisture into the hair shaft and retain that moisture . High porosity hair has a very difficult time retaining moisture because water enters and leaves the shaft easily . ( NOTE : Overly porous hair is normally due to chemical and mechanical damage and is even more difficult to moisturize . ) To test your hair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the guide below . It is also important to note that hair porosity can change over time due to use of chemicals , heat , and age of hair . <p> Elasticity refers to the " stretchiness " of your hair , which is how much you hair will stretch and then return to its normal state . If your hair is healthy , when wet , it should stretch 50% or more and return to its normal state . Unhealthy hair may only stretch about 20% when wet . Hair that is not elastic is more prone to breakage . It is also harder to curl with rollers or heat styling tools . To test for elasticity , pull strands from at least four areas of your head . Determine how much it springs break , how quickly it springs break , and whether your hair breaks . <p> So there you have it ! The simple breakdown of " hair typing " . As you can see , it is much more than 1 , 2 , 3 and A , B , C. Sorry I could n't resist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that you can have any combination of these characteristics . ( So although you think your hair looks like " Ebony " when you watch her video its not . ) <p> In the next installment , take things a step further .

@@24773036 @4773036/ <h> Winter Natural Hair Care 101 43055 @qwx243055 <p> On my side of the country , it is becoming clear that the summer time is over and the cold winter is here . With the change in weather , - it is time- to dig out those wool sweaters and winter coats to stay warm . It is also time to give your natural coif some extra TLC . The cold winter air can strip your hair of moisture and leave it brittle and limp . So kiss those wash-n-go 's goodbye and take a look at these tips to help you through the next few bitterly cold winter months . <p> 1 . Hot oil treatments- Your hair needs all the moisture it can get in order to stay moisturized- throughout the day . One way to ensure long-term results is to get in the habit of once a week hot oil treatments . This is really simple . <p> Fill a pot with water and bring to a boil . In an applicator bottle , fill it half way with olive oil and the rest of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hot water and occasionally test the temperature- on the back of your hand . While the oil is heating up , separate your into sections if it is past the TWA stage . If you are still rocking a cool TWA , skip this step . Once the oil is warm , drench each section of hair in the oil and make sure you work the oil into your scalp and the hair all the way to the ends . If you are a TWA diva , simply run the tip of the applicator bottle throughout your scalp and work the oil into your hair with your finger tips . Cover your head with a plastic cap and you can sit under a dryer to let the oil penetrate or , if you do n't have a hooded dryer like me , simply take a hot shower with the door close and let the warm air do it 's job . Co-wash your hair as usual . <p> 2 . Deep conditioning Deep conditioning once a week- is an awesome way to bring your hair back to life . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am not using any chemicals and only the good stuff is in my hair .

Combine the ingredients in a blender and make sure it is completely smooth . Bananas are also known for their hair conditioning properties so , for an extra punch , throw a banana in there too . Apply your mixture and let set for about 30 mins to an hour and rinse. - Trust me , your curls will be bouncy and your braid outs will look amazing . <p> 3 . Say NO to wash-n-go's-- I know , I know . Wash-n-go's- are such an easy go to style and usually , if- I am having a bad hair day , I run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hair well simple make your hair dry and brittle .

While your hair is slightly moist , work in your very best shea butter mixture and you should be good to go and your hair should be barely moist by the time you leave the house . <p> 4 . Stay away from humectants- ( for now ) - This is very important if you live in a very dry and cold area during the winter months . During the summer , humectants- are your best friend .

Its all-natural , smells great and its moisturizing . - It has some of my favorite ingredients of course , coconut oil but also- Aloe Vera , Jojoba Oil and Vitamin E. This is my all-in-one product while I 'm traveling. - This will be my daily moisturizer and styling creme for re-twisting or other styling options . <p> Empty Water Bottle- No explanation needed . A little water and vegetable glycerine is needed to re-twist and re-moisturize natural hair . Its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hairstyles ; you cant pull up dry hair . And of course its empty . I do n't  want to risk ruining my stuff . <p> Large and Regular Size Bobby Pins- Bobby pins help to create versatility with my twist out without completely changing the style . Or if I decide I want to wear a cute pin-up or bun style , they are a must-have . A woman should keep bobby pins at all times , in my opinion . <p> Bristle Brush- I do n't  use a Bristle Brush often and for good reason . They can wreck havoc on your hair . When I do its just to smooth my ends with the help of water and a moisturizer . <p> Hair Clips- These are for hair emergency purposes only ! I will only bring these babies out in the event that I have to shampoo or co-wash my hair which is rarely the case . I almost always shampoo , condition , and style my hair before any trip . <p> Nylon Pantyhose or Knee High- You know pantyhose make the best puffs and high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your hair without creating tension which can lead to breakage . Check out this style tutorial with a nylon knee high . <p> Denman Brush- The Denman Brush receives mixed reviews but it works wonders for my hair . I use it both for detangling and to define my natural curls in the shower . Plus , its almost $10 so its not something I would go out and buy in a crunch . <p> Wide Tooth Comb- This a more ideal detangling tool but also styling too . - A long , wide tooth comb is perfect for styling dry hair but wo n't stress your hair out too much .

Avoid toggling between either overly greasy or bone dry hair with these tips to keep your natural hair moisturized and balanced : <h> Sometimes you need to use water rather than more product <p> If you have already used a good amount of product on your hair , you may want to spritz it with water instead of using more product . There 's no need to saturate your hair a little mist will do just fine . This gives you the moisture that you need without leaving you with overly greasy hair . Also keep in mind that continuing to pile product on your hair can lead to dryness . When you constantly load your hair with product it may get coated and the moisture that you are attempting to put onto your hair will get blocked off . <h> Know when its time for a wash <p> When our hair has too much buildup it will be prone to dryness . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , water , or oil that we use does n't  absorb as well . If it seems like no matter what you do you cant seem to moisturize your hair effectively it may be time for a wash . <h> Protective styles <p> Hair worn in protective styles retains moisture for a longer period of time than hair that is worn out , - and it requires very little product . You may even be able to go a couple of days without using any product while wearing a protective style . <h> No more dry hair after washing <p> If your hair tends to get super dry after washes like mine , try using a good deep conditioner and a leave in . When I skip these two steps and I just do a quick shampoo and use a cheapie conditioner I definitely can feel the difference in my hair . Not only does a quality conditioner help to strengthen your hair and make it more manageable , but it also helps with retaining more moisture . <p> Keep balance in your hair by assessing its needs first . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but sometimes keeping balance in your hair may require a different solution .

After a while , though , if we tend to pile em on , we may begin to experience some buildup . Yuck ! Give your hair its life back with these three clarifying options ! <p> Fill your bottle with ACV , the rest with water . Add a few drops of your essential oils of choice . My favorites are Rosemary Oil at Amazon , $9.50 , which- assists in the removal of dandruff and stimulates growth , and- Tea Tree Oil at Amazon , $14.99- which is soothing , aids in treating scalp conditions and leaves the scalp feeling refreshed . Shake it up , massage it in , let it sit for a few minutes and rinse well with cool water . Apple Cider Vinegar at Amazon , $7.02 , also closes the hair cuticle to promote smoother , shinier hair and will help balance the pH of the hair and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes , it burns ! The smell may linger when wet but will dissipate as your hair dries . <p> Baking Soda Rinse <p> This clarifying concoction will get rid of that nasty residue without making the hair feel stripped . I especially like to use this rinse to remove buildup when I 'm wearing protective styles like braids or twists . Baking Soda at Amazon , $8.64 <p> Place your ingredients in the bottle and shake it up well . If your hair is long or really thick , feel free to double the ingredients but do n't add more baking soda unless you add more water . The mixture should be liquidy , not grainy . Spray onto the scalp and hair , massage it in , leave on for about three minutes then rinse thoroughly . <p> Rhassoul Clay <p> You may need to head to a specialty or health food store for this one . Rhassoul is a mineral-rich , natural clay that has been used for centuries to enhance texture and volume , soften the hair and eliminate dandruff . Not only does it safely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Here is a super simple recipe from one of my favorite vloggers , Whitney aka Naptural85 . <p> What I love about all of these options is that they 're natural , quick and they get the job done without making your hair feel dry in the process . While the hair is deeply cleansed and clarified , the moisture is left intact . Amazing !

If cowashing is your main form of cleansing your hair , clarification should come more often than once a month . Clarification comes in many forms , explained perfectly here . 
@@24773057 @4773057/ <p> I am over the moon excited as I write this post . So , I tried the Shea Moisture Ammonia-Free Hair Color System in the shade Bright Auburn over the weekend . Ok , I have never in my entire life colored my hair , so you can only imagine how scared I was . However , I put my big girl panties on and embraced the red . And I love it ! <p> First I must say that the packaging is fun to look at . The artwork is divine ! All the boxes ( no matter the shade ) are intriguing in design . When you open the box the contents are nicely packaged in a pretty little bag inside . Emphasis was indeed placed on packaging I must say . This system is moisture-rich , 100% Ammonia free and sulfate free . What 's not to love ? <h> How I Used This Product <p> The information booklet inside the box was very clear and descriptive . You could use the brush method if you know what you 're doing or if you 're like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bottle method . This was pretty easy . The color was in a tube and there was a developer bottle and you are supposed to mix the two together in the bottle , shake and apply . In no time my hair looked fire red . I was actually scared it would look that red . <p> After 30 mins I rinsed the color out until the water was clear . I have read and watched enough videos to know that after coloring your hair , it will feel stripped . But this did n't  happen AT ALL ! The Shea Moisture color system is 100% Ammonia-free so that is why my hair wasnt stripped . My hair took the color really well . My hair was n't too red but it did scream " -Look At Me ! ' I loved it so far . <p> I then shampooed with the Raw Shea Moisture Retention Shampoo that came in the box . Honestly , I love this shampoo and the bottle had a lot in it . I will certainly get at least 2 more washes out of what is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soft and not stripped at all . <p> I conditioned with the Raw Shea Restorative Conditioner . I loved the conditioner but it was so hard to get it out of that bottle . Shea Moisture need to do something about that bottle situation . It 's not really squeezable and the conditioner is thick . Now , as it relates to the conditioner itself ; I AM SOLD ! I love the slip . I love how my hair sucks it up . I love how soft it left my hair . I LOVE ! I LOVE ! I LOVE ! I LOVE ! Ok that 's enough Shelly . LOL ! I will be buying a full size of this conditioner ( and thank God the full size has a pump ) . <p> I towel dried my hair and added some of the Raw Shea Reconstructive Finishing Elixir that came in the box . Then I applied my Curl and Style Milk and twist my hair and add some rods on the ends and that was the end of my process . I did notice it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was in dye . I am not sure if I did n't  do something right or what . However , I read online and asked around and see that bleeding is common after coloring . My question is : When will it stop ? Advice needed so feedback encouraged . <h> Pros <p> - Ammonia-Free so it is not as harsh on your hair as regular box color systems <p> - Sulfate-Free <p> - Easy to apply yourself ( save your salon money ) <p> Decent sized shampoo , conditioners and elixir. ( you can get another use out of it ) <p> Left my hair feeling soft and moisture <h> Cons <p> Conditioner bottle is not squeezable so its hard to get the product out . ( Work on that Shea Moisture ! ) <h> Final Thoughts <p> Overall I love the Shea Moisture Ammonia-Free Hair Color System . I have never colored before and was scared out of my wits . But I see now that I had nothing to worry about . I love the color I got and love how my hair feels and look . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very helpful for people like me who knows nothing about coloring . I am not enjoying the bleeding too much but I read that is normal at first . 43055 @qwx243055 <h> Related 43052 @qwx243052 43059 @qwx243059

Most people are not aware , however , that how you install your protective style and your hair practices while wearing a protective style still matters , especially for long-term hairstyles . When a style is installed improperly or when your hair is not cared for while in a protective style , the result is a ton of breakage when taking your hair down from the style . <p> The following six tips will help you to avoid damaged hair as a result of improper protective style installation and hair care . <h> Installing the Protective Style <p> There are three aspects of installing a protective style to consider the Tightness , Tools , and Products . <p> Tightness : Whether you are going to a hairstylist or doing your hair yourself , make sure to stress that you do not want the style to be too tight . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pulling your face back , then the style is too tight . This is also very important around your edges . The edges of your hair are fragile because there is less hair around it to support the tightness of some styles . <p> Tools : Hairstyles that require the use of combs , brushes , tangle teezers , and other tools that cause your hair to break is a sign that if you want to wear that style you will need to look for another tool that works better with your hair . By using tools that usually do not work well with your hair , you run the risk of causing breakage and that breakage may never get addressed while your hair is in a protective style . <p> Products : Since the products you use are going to sit on your hair for the duration of your style look for products that maintain moisture and avoid products that easily cause build up . <h> Wearing the Style <p> Maintaining the cuteness of your hairstyle is important , but be careful not to sacrifice the health of your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to your hair even if it may affect the fresh look of your style . <p> Wash/Condition When Necessary : It is so easy to put off washing your hair when it is in a protective style because you want your style to stay fresh . But the health of your scalp is important in order to grow your hair . If your scalp starts to flake and feels itchy , then wash your hair . The same applies to your strands . If you know you applied many heavy products that can coat your hair , then cleansing your strands is a necessity to avoid the adverse effect of product build-up . Product coating the strands also blocks the hair from receiving moisture , and since moisture retention is an issue many naturals face , you want your strands to always be able to receive moisture .

Sheamoisture Coconut &amp; Hibiscus Co-wash Conditioning Cleanser was no different. - I was very excited to try this one . - Ingredients like Shea Butter and Coconut Oil are two of the best moisturizers for my hair . Unlike other cowashing conditioners , such as As I Am , that only have conditioning ingredients , SheaMoistures product also has cleansing ingredients such as Kaolin Clay and African Black Soap extract . This makes it a true conditioning cleanser . - As I Am Co-wash Coconut Conditioner - left my hair heavy and scalp itchy after about 2 days , so I was hoping this would not be the case with SheaMoisture Coconut &amp; Hibiscus Co-Wash Conditioning Cleanser . <p> SUGGESTED USE : Massage in for 3 to 5 minutes working from root to ends . Rinse thoroughly with warm water . Repeat as needed . <p> Suggested Retail Price : $9.99 <h> How I Used This Product <p> Upon using this product for the first time I was about 3-4 days post @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sulfate-free shampoo . - This cuts down on build up on my hair and scalp . - On shampoo day , I did a twistout with only coconut oil and shea butter .

This is important to note because natural ingredients wash out easily with water and gentle cleansers . <p> Whenever Im using a product for the first time I always apply as directed . I parted my hair into 4 sections in the shower . - I rubbed the conditioner on my scalp with the pads of my fingers first . - Then I smoothed the conditioners on my ends and applied to the rest of my hair . I detangled each section with a shampoo comb and twisted , then rinsed the conditioner out thoroughly . - Four days later I repeated the same process to rehydrate my hair . - I also wanted to test the product twice before giving my review . <h> Pros <p> Results : My hair and scalp both felt clean and moisturized after using @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The product was easy to apply , it had a medium consistency that 's perfect for fine or coarse hair types , and there was nice slip for detangling. - The next day I noticed that my hair still felt both soft and moisturized. - I also did not feel itchy dry scalp in between co-washing . <p> - Better Than Others On The Market : I want to emphasize that this is a co-washing conditioning CLEANSER and not simply a conditioner . - It actually leaves your hair and scalp clean instead of simply coating the hair with conditioning ingredients . - This is the biggest advantage of this product compared to some other products marketed as co-washes . <h> Cons <p> ad#ad1 <p> Price : I have a lot of hair and that 8 oz bottle was half gone after one use ! Okay , I 'm exaggerating . - I used about a half dollar size amounts per section which is still a good amount per use of any product . - - The suggested price of $9.99 is the average price for most SheaMoisture products . - While @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was only 8 oz compared to other SheaMoisture products that are 12 oz for the same price . I 'm sure I 'm not the only one who needs and wants this product in a bigger bottle . <p> Product Usage : It 's important to keep in mind that this is a co-washing cleanser . - Its best to use a cowash to hydrate curls in between shampoo sessions , not to use as your sole cleansing product . I also believe that my consistent use of natural products did have an effect on my experience with this product . Its possible for someone who use products that create buildup or have synthetic ingredients such as mineral oil , petrolatum , or silicones will have an negative experience . - Shampoo is needed to remove these things .

I have a website called Heygorjess.com where I talk about natural hair , health , beauty , and God . Today I am going to share with you my experience getting a Deva Cut at the Devachan Salon this past May in New York ( on Broadway in Soho ) . Make sure you check at the pics below . <p> Very few stylist are training in the Deva Cut . You can find a stylist or salon near you here . <p> This was the first time I got my hair cut in about a year . I do n't like getting my haircut because there are n't many stylist I trust and I really wanted my hair to grow . But eventually I decided to get one because unfortunately I had some heat damage I had to get rid of and I also wanted more of shape . So I decided to go and it was an awesome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and now my hair has more of a round shape . Also , since all of my heat damaged ends were cut , my curls are a lot curlier and defined ! It makes a huge difference in how they look . <p> So why did I decide to go to the Devachan Salon ? Well , getting the right cut is sooo important ! You ca n't go to just anybody , especially if they do n't know how to specifically cut curly hair . The Devachan Salon specializes in itso they make sure that you get the perfect shape and look . They cut your hair while its dry so that you will have the right shape ( because if they cut it while wet , they would n't know how much shrinkage you 'd get , etc ) . The right shape also affects how your hair will grow out when it gets longer . So it is super important . <p> The service was also great ! I loved my stylist , Melanie . She is super sweet and cut my hair just how I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a Princess lol . They offer you coffee , tea , or wine , and after your cut they wash and condition your hair in a super comfy chair while they basically massage your scalp . I almost fell asleep ! LOL . <p> My hair is very easy to style with my new cut . My stylist cut a lot of layers which made my hair easier to manage and comb through ! ( Thank God lol ) . - Also my wash and go 's look a lot better ! I use SheaMoisture Curl Enhancing Smoothie as my leave-in and then apply Curl Junkie 's Pattern Pusha on top as my styling gel . <p> So as you can see I really loved my Devachan experience and I will probably go back in another year or so . The only con I will mention is that if you have heat damaged or really dead endsbe prepared to lose some length . I lost more than I wanted , but I really think it was because my hair was damaged and needed it .

Heat straightening can be done at home but I recommend consulting a professional for best result . In the hairs straight state it is easier to see the current condition of your natural hair . You can observe the full length and thickness . Inspect your ends and remove any dead split ends more evenly . It also gives you another versatile look which was the reason you went natural anyway . <p> How do you straighten natural curly hair without chemicals ? <p> We all know the old fashion way , a stove and a metal pressing/straightening comb .

Some signs that your hair can more than withstand the heat are shine , minimal breakage/shedding and great moisture retention . Identify the health of your curly state . <p> Secondly , consult an experienced natural hair professional . Preferably a recommended stylist .

I love Chi Silk Infusion it smells good and works great to seal natural moisture and helps to prevent reversion . Also , consider oil sheen to add oil without wieghing your hair down . You must also take in consideration the climate and season of your environment . In hot , humid areas no sense in wasting your time or money , its almost impossible to keep your natural hair straight in the Summer and/or Spring months .

I leave my hair straight for about a week just because I cant go without cleansing longer than that . You also can not use moisturizers that may weigh down the hair or make it wet . You must limit physical activity that may cause sweating in your head . Be very careful in the shower it is best to wrap the hair prior and cover with a shower cap . Do not uncover or unwrap your hair in a steaming bathroom ( its just a recipe for disaster ) . <p> I also wanted to add that its ok to do a mid-week touch up with the flat iron or curling iron . Notice I said mid-week not daily or every other day . If you do n't  like the way your hair is looking in between touch ups , improvise .

I only had about an inch of hair to start with , but it was a freeing experience to do simple things , like feel the sun on my scalp ! <p> BC was the best option for me when I started transitioning . For a while I rocked the bantu , twists out or just a really big afro puff after removing my protective styles but it became more difficult because I basically had two different hair textures ( natural growth and the relaxed hair ) .

Today , those small businesses have grown significantly and you can now find them in major retail outlets like Target , Walmart , Walgreens , Sephora , and even Macys . The market has grown so much that mainstream companies have switched their focus from relaxed to natural hair . And many of us are trying them even with the " no-no ingredients " . - But what about all of the great organic products on the market targeted to all hair types but work GREAT on natural hair ? If you have n't given them a try , I encourage you to give them a whirl . These well-formulated products - can do wonders for your natural hair even though they do n't  say " natural hair " on the bottle . You simply have to pay attention . Whenever a formula states that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hair then a bell should ring . Our hair is the driest of all hair types , so these formulas can work for us .

It provides amazing slip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but once I tried Tresemme I was hooked . It is rich and creamy and did I mention slip ? Slip for days !

I forayed into the Burts Bees moisturizing shampoo , after using the shampoo/baby wash on my daughters . - Their hair was unbelievable soft , with minimal shrinkage . The next day , I bought the shampoo for myself and I have n't looked back since . You can find Burts Bees hair products at Target , Walgreens , Drugstore.com- and many natural food stores.Terresentials Mud Wash <p> Made popular by Naptural85 , Terresentials is a great alternative for traditional shampoo . If you do n't  like to mix your own batch of Bentonite or Rhassoul Clay , then you may want to give this a try . Because it clarifies without stripping the hair or causing lots of shrinkage , it is a great shampoo option for naturals . You can purchase it online @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so its not exactly " curly girl " friendly , but it provides a great dose of protein for natural hair .

I 've rarely ever heard them referred to as endearing ( and only if the person was being sarcastic ) . Most women either hate or ignore them . They charge them as just a necessary evil of being natural . When I first cut off my relaxed ends , I became all too familiar with these little nasties . Over time , I learned a few ways to manage these vexatious diminutive tangles . So before you sentence yourself to countless hours of your life staring at your strands through a magnifying glass needle and scissors in tow here are a couple of ideas on how to prevent single strand knots or reduce their occurrence . <p> ad#ad1 <p> Moisturize at least twice a day with a nutritive moisturizer . Look for super moisturizing natural ingredients . Remember that oil is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before you seal with an oil . Moisturized hair is less likely to knot up . <p> Do not give your hair the opportunity to coil up on its own : wear protective styles , braids , braid outs , twist outs or roller sets . For extra protection against knots , set the ends on rollers . This may be difficult to swallow if you 're a wash-n-go type of girl , but if the knots are really getting on your nerves , you will have to decide whether you love your fro more or hate the knots . <p> Protect your hair while you sleep . Wear silk/satin bonnets or scarves to bed . Braid , twist , bun or place your hair so that its comfortable for you to sleep , but in a way that it wont coil up on its own ends . Friction from cotton bedding can damage the hair over time if its not being protected . <p> Deep condition or use deep treatments on your hair weekly and really focus on taking care of those ends . Healthy hair is less likely to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of oiling well-conditioned wet hair ( also ) known as oil rinsing to seal to make your hair easier to detangle . One way is to deep condition , apply oil and use a heat cap or wear the treatment overnight . Another way is to shampoo , oil , condition and rinse the hair . This makes the hair easier to detangle and prevents knots and matting . <p> Do thorough , but careful detangling . Use a seamless fine tooth comb after detangling with a wide tooth comb or your fingers ( and perhaps a Denman brush ) . Always start and the ends and work your way up . This is not something youd want to do everyday because using a comb in a hurry is tantamount to using a pair of scissors if you are n't  careful . A careful detangling should take A LOT of time . Divide your hair into sections and detangle each section before moving on to another section . <p> If you must shampoo , only apply the shampoo to your scalp . I shampoo once a month or less . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hair before any water ever touches my hair is a far superior method than the traditional way of shampooing . I section my hair and apply to my scalp as if I 'm greasing my scalp and then rinse out in the shower , making sure to really massage all of the shampoo out . Sometimes I also apply shampoo to my scalp , diluted with water , with an applicator bottle . With both methods , my hair never mats up , its far easier to detangle and that means I loose less hair when I wash . Shampoo can strip old fragile ends a breeding ground for fairy knots . <p> Stay away from towels and cotton . I never ever use towels or cotton on my hair . They can snag on curly and kinky hair , causing split ends and those dreaded knots . Would you wipe down a Bentley with a cotton bath towel ? Treat your hair the same . <p> Keep your hands out of your hair . Too much manipulation will scratch the cuticle , wreak havoc and can lead to split or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ antique cotton drapes or a fabulous silk dress ? Think of your hair that way . <p> Smooth your hair . Before styling or setting your hair , run your fingers down sections of your hair as if you are flat ironing your hair between your fingers .

I 'm a mom of four little ones , so I 've been where you are right now = True , your hair does n't  she 'd much during pregnancy however , are you aware of postpartum alopecia , or better known as excessive shedding after delivery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't  be alarmed . I just want to give you a heads up in case you experienced this a few month after the birth of your baby and was n't sure about what was happening . From my research , this shedding is perfectly normal . In fact , it happened to me almost every time I gave birth . However , this last time , I was prepared with my hair growth oil so I did n't  lose as much hair as I had in the past plus , my hair grew back faster this time around . Of course , I praised God for that ! Lol ! I 'm sure you have someone to get advice from but just so you know , I 'm here if you have any questions . Jesus loves you and I do too !
