This is great news for people wanting the extra control , provided they 're content to use the left or right edge of the browser as a starting point . Up till now , there has been no way to absolutely align content to a horizontally centered axis in the window . <p> Consider example 1 . We are trying to position a yellow div within a 500 pixel wide centered baby blue div . However , there is a body of text between the two which is theoretically being pulled from a database . We have no way of knowing how large this text area will be , so relative positioning will not work . <p> In example 2 we 've used absolute positioning to align the yellow div to the right of the window , and offset it by 200 pixels to roughly position it within the blue div . This assumes the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resizing it we quickly realize that the yellow div will not stay in that spot long . <p> Were we to try aligning the div to the left side of the window , we 'd experience much the same result . The problem is that the blue div has variable margins in order to center it , so the left and right edges of the div are never a set number of pixels away from the left and right edges of the screen . Unfortunately , this is exactly what absolute positioning does , so the two are seemingly incompatible . <p> The way we 've chosen to center the blue div is the key here . By setting the left and right margins of a div to auto , it will be horizontally centered within its containing element.The blue div , #div1 , is created with the following code : <p> If we assume that the background is transparent , give the div a width of 100% , and position the div to the top left corner of the browser window , then theoretically we can center anything inside it the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ documents body . <p> That means that were going to start treating the p inside the div as a secondary div . Currently in our second example , the yellow div , div3 , looks like so : <p> The first thing we need to do is move it to the top left corner , then well want to remove the width constraint so that it spans the whole window . Secondly , well remove formatting and create a new definition for the p sitting inside our div . A bit of hacking , and our code looks like this : <p> Well , as you can see in example 3 , were a bit off . But if you scale the window , you 'll notice the yellow div is n't moving anymore , so were mostly there . Its currently dead centre , which is n't quite where we want it . Weve run out of elements to modify , unfortunately , since we cant add padding to the div or adjust the margin of the p . Well have to throw a span in the HTML itself to compensate , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ span . <p> And as you 'll see in example 4 , we 've got it . The caveat is that this method relies on the margin : auto method of centering , which IE5 does n't  seem to like . There 's a workaround using text-align which is fully adaptable to this method . View example 5 for an IE5friendly version complete with text-aligns . Alternatively , example 4 aligns to the left , but does n't  otherwise break the intended layout , so you may deem this acceptable for IE5 users .

@@99593393 @3793393/ <p> I do n't  normally respond to CSS help requests , instead referring the asker to the css-discuss mailing list . Its mainly a time issue , but I 'm also of the opinion that you cant learn if you have someone else doing it for you . I 've never been one to ask for help if I could figure it out for myself . With Google and a few good books , I believe everyone can figure out CSS . Its not easy , it takes time , but it is do-able . <p> But the other afternoon I got involved in a dialogue and decided to answer a few questions anyway . here 's a patched-together result , which is very basic and easy to take for granted once you 've learned it ( and of limited use to most who read this site ) , but incredibly difficult to figure out if you have n't . <h> How do you build a dual-column layout ? <p> There 's no mechanism to do this specifically today . CSS-2 tables would be great , if you could use them . Unfortunately , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ method is to hack . And hacks are just that : they work , but they 're not the best solution . The following explanation will hopefully make sense , but it will sound ridiculous and over-wrought . Rightfully so , but we still have to compromise to make things work . <p> That piece of CSS corresponds directly with &lt;div id= " topBar " &gt; , since # is the symbol for an i 'd . Similarily , if I 'd used class= " topBar " then I could use . topBar in the CSS , as classes are symbolized by periods . <p> Next , to assign a height : <p> #topBar height : 100px ; <p> Inches and centimetres are n't  very useful on-screen . Pixels , symbolized by px , are better for this sort of thing . To give it a background color : <p> #topBar height : 100px ; background-color : #991122 ; <p> The sidebar is pretty easy too . Instead of giving it a height , youd assign a width : <p> #sideBar width : 200px ; background-color : #996600 ; <p> The tricky part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the left , the best way to bring the content area up beside it is to pull the sidebar out of the document flow . <p> What does this mean ? An HTML document is structured linearly , and by default all elements will display in the same order as they are listed in the markup . Its very rare that youd want to leave the elements displaying this way , so there are tricks involving absolute positioning and float that allow you to do something about it . <p> The trick is to remember that when you remove an item from the flow , any influence it had on the position of other elements disappears . Which means that in this case , we need to rig a layout where #sideBar wo n't influence #contentAreas position . <p> #sideBar width : 200px ; background-color : #996600 ; float : left ; <p> You 'll see at this point that #contentArea will overlap #sideBar . This is expected , since #sideBar no longer affects #contentAreas position . So how do we stop that ? A pretty simple fix : push #contentArea over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> #contentArea margin-left : 200px ; background-color : #FFDDAA ; <p> And there you have it , a two-column layout with a header . See how it comes together on this sample page . There are issues with this layout , particularily a ) if you want to add a footer , and b ) if you want to assign a background colour to either column that extends the length of the page , instead of the length of the columns content . There are ways to do both . Perhaps a follow-up will come later that explores these methods ; I have a working layout that does both at once , and is n't dependent on the content size of either column . Ill try to pare that down to the basics and explore it sooner or later . 30454 @qwx890454 <p> Dave , I am no way near the expert in CSS that you and visitors to this site are . However , its been my experience while helping people at Webdeveloper forums ( http : **26;0;TOOLONG ) that absolute-positioned layouts are easier to comprehend than floats . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absolute positioned sideBar is a better choice . <p> Interesting point , I 've heard it said that floats are tricky to wrap your mind around . <p> In this case , the difference between float : left ; and position : absolute ; left : 0 ; is pretty much nil . Same end result . I prefer floats for layouts , because its possible to clear them later for the benefit of a footer . You cant do that with absolute . <p> Still , for the sake of raw comprehension , maybe I should revise that . Thanks for bringing it up , Niket . <p> There definately are two different mindsets about doing two or even three column layouts : the floating way , and the absolute way . Just like Perl , there 's more than one way to accomplish an end . <p> Personally , I fall into the float camp , and I had just redone my two and three column layouts with the approach presented here ( I had been floating both my content and menu before ) , and was planning on writing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this one ! Good article . <p> Oh , and I do agree about the teaching floating comment . I am in the process of writing some beginners documentation for our own Web Dev site to help students create basic templates , and explaining floats can be a real pain . <p> As far as extending both columns , I used a technique that extends my sites sidebar ( though not the main content , as its usually longer ; usually ) . However , I had to hide it from Internet Explorer , due to a weird rendering bug in which the background image would overlap the text at an arbitrary point . Ill fix it eventually ( when I go about cleaning up the code ) , but I 'm leaving it as-is for now . <p> Are there any advantages of floating the sidebar rather than floating the content ? ( ALA-style ) Or is it just personal preference ? <p> It would seem that floating the content would be useful if you wanted a sidebar that extended all the way down , and your content was always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ways to accomplish the same thing . <p> The method as stated has a problem , which is this : once you 've got your columns , the next thing you 'll want is to give them margins ( more strictly padding , but beginners would call them margins ) . This method falls apart right there , at least on IE5+ and IE6 without the right DOCTYPE . ( Do I really need to add a link to the ALA article here ? I think not ! ) After much fiddling , I think the only reliable method is the double-DIV : every section has an outer DIV to apply overall width to and an inner DIV or other block-level element to apply padding and margins to . I 've got a silly little tool for generating arbitrarily complex double-DIV layouts at http : //flurf.net/boxy/ if you 're interested ; its kludgey , but what the hell . <p> Of course , this is just the start . Eventually the DIVs will multiply , and before you know it <p> Three DIVs for the design-gods painting on Macs , Seven for the usability-lords @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doomed to debug , One for the Zeld Man on his orange page , In the land of New York where the pundits cry . One DIV to size them all , One DIV to pad them , One DIV to colour them all and in the browser style them In the land of W3 where the standards lie . <p> When I first learned how to make site layouts with CSS I looked at the W3Cs homepage ( http : //www.w3.org/ . ) They float every column and place a cleared element after the columnar section . I continue to use this technique for most designs I make . <p> Lenny - that 's what I meant by " at least on IE5+ and IE6 without the right DOCTYPE " . Unfortunately , the DOCTYPE does n't  help on IE5+ , which is why you need a fudge factor . My method does this : <p> * apply a 3% fudge factor for the benefit of IE5 , hiding it using * html so the other browsers do n't  choke ; <p> * apply a 0.1% fudge factor for IE6 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it from other browsers using * html , and from IE5 using the backslash hack ( width : ) ; <p> * include an empty &lt;div class= " enclose " &gt;&lt;/div&gt; ( the style is enclose clear : both ; ) inside any floated DIVs that contains other floated DIVs , to force compliant browsers to enclose them properly ( IE already encloses them anyway , which is the Wrong Thing ) ; <p> My website uses tables ( do n't  laugh , I 'm changing it soon ) but I have made many expirmental CSS layouts . I prefer the float way shown in this post . I seems more logical . Ok , no it does n't  . I take that back . But , it just ARG . Its less work ? I du n no why I like it . But I do . <p> Uff , Eric , the box code generator is very nice indeed ( maybe little help on how to create the template schema ( I found that you have to set proper align ( 3 spaces ? ) by myself ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now do n't  really want to use so many nested divs or we are back where we started . <p> Well , I have to say that Mr. Sheas explaination of floating is one of the clearest that I 've read . <p> Ive been poking around the various css web resources and have fiddled with my pages using a float variation . But I have never been really clear on why float did what it did . Now I get it . Thanks Dave . <p> ( I really hope I get all those css books on my Xmas list so everything else becomes clearer . ) <p> Thanks for the reminder on floating the sidebar , Dave . I had forgotten about that on my layout and was struggling with footers , etc . <p> I tend to do fairly well with the mechanics of CSS and even comprehend most of the hacks/workarounds . The biggest thing I struggle with , however , is the design aspect of creating a site . How do I best present information ? How on earth do I come up with a reasonable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fly rather than having a coherent plan for them . I 'm an old programmer and , obviously , not a graphic design person . Any suggestions on places I can go to learn design rather than CSS mechanics ? <p> Unfortunately , I seem to be stuck in a world where I know good design when I see it , but flounder horribly when faced with a blank page . <p> Finally , a clear enough explanation of creating a basic table-less column layout that I broke down at last and did it to my own site at http : //www.penmachine.com and it worked on the first try . Thanks , Dave . <p> The initial table-removing only took five minutes , but of course all the tweaking I had to do to get things working the way I like it took some time more . <p> One thing I wonder : if you create a right-hand sidebar with a float : right , is there really any need to have a separate div for the main body content ? I used one , but it should work just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ divs . In Eric Meyer on CSS by guess who , he recomends padding and margins 0 and to add padding to all the elements inside the div . EG : a div with i 'd content could then have one encompassing rule div#content padding:0 ; margin : 0 ; div#content h1 , h2 , h3 , p , ul , li , img padding:0 1em ; margin : 0 ; This works around the padding debacle of IE. <p> I 'm in a similar situation . I 'm a nuts and bolts guy . Ive read good things about " The Non-Designers Design Book " by Robin Williams ( ISBN 0321193857 ) . Its around $11 . I 'm planning on getting it and tackling my psuedo-fear of visual design . <p> I 've just been trying to come up with a solution to the problem Dave S. mentions in " b ) if you want to assign a background colour to either column that extends the length of the page , instead of the length of the columns content . " <p> The CSS Creator LONG ... uses an outer div border color @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but that does n't  work if you want your columns to use background images . I 've to decide to use a background image on my outer div - that 's probably what kami was doing . It wont work for a liquid layout , though . I 'm still looking for a smarter solution . <p> Dave , I was surprised that you mentioned using tables for a dual-column layout . Isnt that semantically incorrect ? Or am I missing something ? <p> Im having a problem when I use a fixed width on the content area for some reason IE adds a 3px space to the right of the sidebar and pushes the content area to the side . I cant seem to solve this with out adding some extra &lt;div&gt; or switching the content &lt;div&gt; to absolute positioned . <p> I 'm trying to do a two column layout with a header and footer . I did have this layout with the left column floated . Although there seemed to be a problem when needing to clear elements in the right column . If a clear:left was needed in the right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I now have the left column with an absolute position so that I can clear the elements needed to be cleared in the right column . The problem is , sometimes the content in the left is longer than the content in the right column . When this happens the footer cuts through the left column . Have you seen this problem before ? How did you fix it if you have ? <p> Thanks for the lesson ! I had missed the importance of the margin-right setting for ensuring that the body does n't  encroach on the sidebar . I 'm now a happy chap with Outlook stationery working as I want it ! <p> Niket , I would have to disagree with you a little bit on the absolute postitioning being easier than float for beginners . I do n't  know maybe I am different , But Ryan @ World One Web has been teaching me a ton of things with CSS that I did n't  know , and encouraging me to use div tags instad of frames , etc . He taught me how to float them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a clear : tag in your style sheet , it almost always fixes the problem . I donbt know maybe its just me , but I caught on really quick to the float , I HATE POSITIONING ! . lol <p> I have a reccomendation to all of you out there who need help with color schemes , this site takes one color that you like you . You enter it in hexadecimal and it returns at least 4 matches . These colors just flow together I love this site ! LONG ...

@@99593394 @3793394/ <p> I 've spent a bit of time playing around with HTML5s canvas element lately . Its a fun new toy and has a lot of potential to be useful . But the biggest headache I 'm finding so far is the lack of authoring tools . <p> SVG has been around for ages , whereas Canvas is still relatively new . ( Mozillas Vladimir Vuki-evi- has a good overview presentation of the differences between the two , and when and where to use each . ) SVG support is built into plenty of graphic editing tools ; Canvas support is so far sadly lacking , although Matt May pointed me to this YouTube video that shows off the upcoming Canvas support Adobes CS5 suite will have , whenever it becomes available . <p> In the meantime , most of the Canvas demos we 've seen thus far have mostly featured simple primitive shapes like lines and ellipses for good reason : its too hard to build up a reasonably complex vector image by manually plotting bezier curves . <p> Over the past few days I 've tried out various ways to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of taking vector shapes out of Illustrator and rendering them with Canvas , both involving an intermediate step as SVG first . <p> So to start , from Illustrator ( or any other vector editing application capable of doing so ) export your artwork to SVG . You 'll find the SVG option in the Save As / Save a Copy dialog , and I 've found the SVG profile you choose does n't  really make much of a difference ( though for the sake of argument Ive been using 1.1 ) . <h> 1 ) Manually <p> This method is only theoretical so if you 're looking for the actual how-to , skip ahead to #2 . I figure it might be worth writing this up anyway because , even though I could n't get it working , perhaps itll provide enough of a starting point for someone else to pick up where I left off and build a proper converter . <p> SVG and Canvas are both essentially vector drawing tools ; Canvas is more pixel-oriented , but you are certainly able to plot lines and curves mathematically . Canvas is also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parallels between the two . <p> I spent a bit of time looking into the bezier commands in particular . In SVG , to plot a bezier curve , you do something like this : <p> &lt;path d= " C x1 , y1 x2 , y2 x , y " /&gt; <p> In Canvas , its this instead : <p> ctx.bezierCurveTo ( x1 , y1 , x2 , y2 , x , y ) ; <p> Different syntax , but the same basic components : you 're drawing a line from the current pen position to the x , y value , and before that you have two additional points ( x1 , y1 and x2 , y2 ) that set your handles . ( More SVG path commands , Canvas path methods . ) Its worth noting that SVG is more forgiving about commas ; each coordinate must be separated by a comma for the Canvas method , but they 're strictly optional in the SVG example . This is relevant because Illustrators SVG export seems to be wildly inconsistent about when and how many commas each command uses . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ straightforward to manually tweak the SVG output into Canvas drawing functions . M becomes moveTo , C becomes bezierCurveTo , and so forth . <p> This did not work . I suspect the absolute vs. relative coordinate difference between SVGs c and C commands tripped me up , but after a half hour or so of poking around this was all I had to show for it : <p> Still , even if I 'd have managed to get it right , I 'd rather not have to manually massage my SVG output every time I want a new Canvas drawing . Which leads me to method #2. <h> 2 ) Automatically <p> One of the main reasons I bothered to attempt a manual conversion in the first place was because after an extensive search it appeared that people are mostly interested in converting Canvas to SVG . There are very few articles and tools that cover going the other way , which is what were after . Maybe I did n't  come up with exactly the right search term , but I was finding so little I almost gave up entirely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I managed to stumble across SVGToCanvas , a Java library that promised to do exactly what it sounds like , with a few disclaimers and a major caveat : <p> You need Java 6 . Otherwise known as 1.6 , this comes installed with Mac OS X Snow Leopard but previous versions will need to upgrade . I believe this is the download necessary for Leopard , if you 're on an even older version you 're on your own . No idea what the Windows situation is , but this might be a good place to start . <p> You need to run it on the command line . I know this will freak out some designers , but really , its not terribly difficult . <p> You mainly get outlines for now . This would be the big ugly caveat . Sometimes you get colour and gradients , sometimes you get mixed-up colour and gradients , mostly you do n't  . Plan to re-add them manually . Hopefully this will work better in a future version of the library , but still , having outlines is a solid start @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the JAR file and drop it on your hard drive somewhere easy to find . For now , probably best to drop it in the same folder with the SVG files you 're going to convert . <p> Now , load up the terminal , and find your way to the same directory . here 's a quick command line primer that ought to get you going . The cd , ls , and pwd commands in particular are the ones you need . <p> ( If you need a bit more help than that : put the SVG and JAR files in a folder on your Desktop called canvas . When you open up the terminal , type this minus quotes : cd /Desktop/canvas . Hit return . You 're good , keep reading . ) <p> Run the converter with the following command : <p> java -jar svg2canvas.jar -o cloud.html cloud.svg <p> From left to right : were invoking Java with the SVGToCanvas library , then by -o cloud.html were specifying the output will be written to cloud.html , otherwise it just displays the output in the terminal ( which can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without managing temporary files ) . Then finally at the end , cloud.svg is the input SVG file that we had previously generated from Illustrator . <p> That generates an HTML file which contains a canvas element and the Javascript necessary to render the cloud : <p> In this case it worked , though it added a stroke . When its just the outline , you can restore the colour by manually tweaking the code . Add a fillStyle method before the draw , and a fill after : <p> ctx.fillStyle(#4a6481) ; ... ( drawing commands here ) .. ctx.fill() ; <p> Not too difficult for simple shapes . I 'd hate to have to manually re-add the subtle gradients for more complicated illustrations , but its nice to know the outline conversion is fairly robust : <p> Figure : SVG original on the left , the converted Canvas version on the right . <p> One more thing : I 'd recommend flattening the vector art as much as possible . Join shapes that can be joined , expand effects and compound paths and masks , and generally clean up the artwork @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , more chance of success upon conversion . <p> So there you go . Its still a fairly painful way to get your vector work into a canvas , but until we get some better tools or built-in support for our existing tools , its one way to fill the gap . <p> I have n't used it that specific functionality myself ( it seems to be disabled in the trial software ) , but Opacity has the ability to export to Canvas ( Opacity calls this a factory ) . http : **26;28;TOOLONG <p> @Anders - I gave it a shot , and *was* able to get it to work in the trial . I had to draw the item using the Opacity drawing tools as the SVG import seems to render it like a bitmap . I was able to make a cloud-like shape , but did n't  quite grok how to make negative spaces like the eyes and mouth . Anyway , it seems Opacity might be worth a second look for this type of thing . <p> Hey Dave , it should be noted that this technology @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which means that this is technology that they 're playing around with and has no guarantee of ever seeing the light of day . They 're just showing what " could be . " <p> I did a write-up about this a few months ago which includes a link to the full disclaimer . <p> Hi , have you looked into doing a straight conversion ? PostScript and the . AI format are surprisingly readable , if you 're comfortable with numbers . <p> The keyword on the sneakpeek video is " FXG " its a tool-neutral representation , already supported in the Creative Suite tools . You do n't  need to wait for Adobe to do anything more to enable it FXG format is already there . <p> That will open up some really interesting design possibilities , but the pessimistic side of me thinks it will be years before you could use it as a standard design element without having to have a second design for older browsers . <p> There is a chance that Inkscape , the open-source vector drawing program , will soon support exporting to Canvas commands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are other options . See the discussion at : <p> Thanks for the interesting write up and link to Matts video on youtube . I have been playing around with the canvas element over the last month and have been slightly let down by the amount of code it takes to create a simple illustration . <p> Another approach , using Illustrator to author the graphic : Skip SVG altogether . AI can be scripted , with an Adobe extension to JavaScript ( Extend Script ) . When executing such a script , it has document object access to the object structure of the current document . In theory , a conversion script could be written that traverses the internal tree and emits canvas code to a file . <p> Nice tutorial Dave ! Your predictions are right ! Ive been wondering about Canvas-to-SVG for a long time : P I also think it will be better if adobe suite 5 does support canvas . Even though canvas looks like its too much work . BTW , it does n't  work on IE. What a shocker : P 30455 @qwx890455 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Canvas " , an entry posted on 14 January , 2010 , to the 43 collection .

The detection algorithm appears a bit immature yet , since it only appears to work when the bill is prominently featured and at close to a horizontal alignment . <p> My copies of other currency were too low-res to trigger the detection , I only experienced this on US bills . The euros , pounds , and Canadian dollars I tried did n't  issue a warning . However , were the EURion constellation clearly visible on my samples ( it was n't ) , I 'm sure I 'd have seen the same warning . <p> If you want to try it yourself , the current first Google Images search for 50 dollar bill nets a perfect example . ( And yes , there are legitimate uses for opening reproductions of currency in an image editor that do n't  constitute counterfeiting ; ever work with a company in the financial sector ? ) <p> Yeah , I found this feature while scanning Euros and Pounds for a travel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them . but , you 're right , after rotating them , the warning disappeared Its an interesting feature . <p> This has been going on since Photoshop CS . In fact , CS wont even let you open the file , let alone print . You 're simply not allowed to process bank note images. I remember there being a bit of a controversy about this when CS first came out . People were saying that this algorithm was unjustly slowing down the program due to it being unoptimized . <p> Interesting . All the workarounds here seem to fail for me in CS2 . It seems to detect it pretty well on the fly . I tried it with Daves 45 degree still complained when I " printed " it ( try using the preview feature or print to a PDF ) . <p> It looks like ImageReady also does n't  have a print command at all ( or at least one under the File menu ) so that workaround wo n't work either . <p> I think you 're far too kind , Dave . This bug ( not a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and hassle users . And really , its the paper and ink that are hard to copy anyway , not the artwork . <p> As far as Euro bills are concerned , I think printing them on any kind of personal printer ( even laser color ) would n't make a satisfactory counterfeit ; the aluminum stripe would n't look anywhere near decent . <p> It makes you wonder what other govt funded algorithms are inbedded into the code and what else thay are looking for . Does this send a flag if you are connected to the internet . Obviously the OFFICIAL line is NO , but what do you think ? <p> This feature has been in CS since photoshop added the CS minker to its title . In fact - an article I read when CS came out stated that the CS denoted counterfeit supression technology - although it did n't  say that CS actually was an acronym for counterfeit supression <p> As Courtney Miles pointed out , although this would work with Aussie Bank Notes , it would n't help counterfeit people that are trying to copy our notes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not paper ones , and every business knows how to check for a forged note . <p> That 's immediately what I thought as well - why print it in photoshop anyway ? Save the file and print it off somewhere else if you have to . <p> And can you imagine the work these poor people at adobe had to do to make that ? XD I bet they were all thinking the exact same thing . Maybe its an Adobe-based legal issue though , so as to omit thier program from being one of the possible programs that could have been used to print money . Keeps them in the clear for any legal battles ( though highly unfeasible in this scenario ) there may be . <p> Youve got to be kidding me . I 've seen ludicrous claims for Photoshop before , but to suggest its the favorite tool of counterfeiters ? *Ahem* Its not just a matter of the design . There is a special grade of paper used by the mint . This has tiny microthreads woven into it and is much more durable than ordinary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are printed on the currency in three different layers . Finally , there are watermarks embedded into the paper itself . And I 'm not even saying what else . <p> The technology to make US currency is well outside the capacity of your scanner , jet printer , and *any* software , much less Photoshop . And this is a past career in the banking industry as well as a collector of world coins and currency talking . Somebody needs to get over themselves . <p> Right , it does take a lot of hardware to make a passable counterfeit bill , that could get past the eyes of an expert banker . But , to run off a few 10s or 20s that you can wrinkle up a bit and slip in with some real bills and pass off to your local Wal-Mart underpaid cashier , it does n't  take a lot . I worked at Wal-Mart for 2 straight years , and most cashiers barely look at the cash . Obviously the bank notices if it makes it past our cash handler , but the person who spent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ counter-feit that only needs that level of realism can be easily made with Photoshop , a decent color laserjet , and the right sheets of paper from , well , Wal-Mart ( got ta spend money to fake money , eh ? ) . <p> Dave said : " ( And yes , there are legitimate uses for opening reproductions of currency in an image editor that do n't constitute counterfeiting ; ever work with a company in the financial sector ? ) " <p> My understanding is that it is in fact illegal in most jurisdictions to scan currency at all ( it certainly is here in Australia , though I doubt PS knows much about Aussie currency ) , which by logical extension would make all subsequent dealings with such a scan legally dubious too . I pretty much read it that , as far as the law is concerned , there is *no* legitimate reason for opening reproductions of currency . <p> Yeah , this has been around for a while .. Had some issues with it , closing in on a couple years back ( right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get on a different computer with an older photoshop version . : ) <p> Hehe , fun article . I stumbled onto this problem as I was doing a prank on the daughter in the house . I was suprised that Photoshop did n't  allow to open the image at all ! It pops up , but when removing the warning that popups it closes down . Naturally I was interested in getting around this , one more hurdle to bypass , : D I already have the Canon Picma MP500 which let 's me scan the bill with nice quality . I quickly found out that inserting the image into a photoshop image with the place function as a PDF worked . Then you could save the document from Photoshop again . I then went through MSPaint , I believe , and opened it as a TIFF and went for Print . <p> Hold your horses , the technology is also inside the printers , : D Atleast my Canon stops printing as soon as the pattern is detected , so no print comes out . Well , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some research , and from what i recall most modern printers have the technology already in place , just as more expensive laser printers also have that nice little identifying pattern which is printed on every print containing serial number of the printer , date of print and so much more , : D This code is by the way hacked now , you find it if you google.

Each needs equal prominence . How do you handle this ? <p> Due to the bilingual nature of the marketplace in my home and native land , an interesting standard has emerged amongst larger e-commerce sites in Canada . Splash pages are making a comeback , or more accurately , they never really died . What 's common on the sites of large retail stores is a mostly useless intro page that forces you to choose your language . Observe : <p> There are exceptions ; HBC is a retail chain that merely includes a fran+ais link in the top corner . And it may be that the latter sites are serving up customized content based on IP address , though I 'll never be able to test that from here . <p> Still , its interesting to observe the single-mindedness in approaching this problem . In previously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Ive come to learn that the choice is driven by politics . If you provide an English page with a link to the French equivalent , or vice-versa , you risk alienating a potentially large percentage of your customer base . So by presenting both on equal ground and forcing the consumer to choose , you side-step the issue and add a half-second delay to their visit to your site . Presumably the adverse reaction to a splash page that might cause some to leave the site completely is far less of a concern than the adverse reaction to not playing the language game well enough . <p> Incidentally , this also used to be a popular trick for retailers to force a choice between US and Canadian currency . By only providing one method of switching between currencies at the very beginning of the visit to the site , the customer would be far less liable to switch to another currency and compare . Thus , the markup built in to US prices ( on top of the exchange rate benefits , when there were any ) would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extra shipping expense ) , sometimes it was just a cash grab . Either way , there 's no reliable method of enforcing one currency or the other , and if an American ordered in Canadian dollars they would generally have had to honour the price . By taking away an easy method for the customer to compare , the problem was usually alleviated .

It was once a portfolio site , then a porfolio/weblog , then a weblog/portfolio , but these days its pretty much entirely weblog . I host other content here and there , but you 're mainly here for the writing . Probably . <h> Archiving <p> The way archiving is done on this site is a little different from the normal , and best described with an analogy . Think of how an issue of a magazine works . Its a series of articles on different topics published during a specific range of time , bound together in a single volume and given a cover image that draws attention while distinguishing that issue from past issues . <p> This site works a little like a series of magazine issues . Each post on the site is bound up as part of a collection , along with other posts published around the same date . That collection is then given a photo , and a colour palette derived from that photo . All posts within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ design elements , which visually groups them together . <p> Traditional weblog posts are usually organized by chronology , and perhaps categories . This idea of collections provides a much more visually obvious method of organization . The posts within do n't  generally relate to each other by subject matter , so chronology is more important , as each collection covers a specific time frame . This is not actually an unfamiliar way of organizing , again going back to the magazine analogy . <p> Each collections window of time is arbitrary , and dictated more by whim than any set schedule ; this is the web after all , technology enables me to play it loose , so why not take advantage of that . Instead of monthly archives , this collections idea lent itself to yearly archives . As soon as I committed to doing it that way , reverse chronological order stopped making sense , and thus my yearly archives are listed in chronological order . <p> Do n't  look for any topical connection between the photo and the collection , there usually is n't one . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of commentary . <p> Is any of this relevant in the age of RSS ? I sure think so . People still have to visit the site to comment , or if someone links to it , or coming in off Google . And hey , it may be possible that mental connections develop between the content and the visuals , enabling easier retrieval of older posts . ( Okay , so that 's tenuous thinking at best , and probably not at all likely . ) Mostly this is just a fun way of keep the visuals fresh over time , and a non-standard way of tying in my Flickr account . That 's all . <h> Colour Schemes <p> There is no set colour scheme for this site ; as the photos change over time , so too do the colours . Each collection gets its own photo , and a colour scheme to match . The colours are sampled directly from the photo , and various light/dark combinations are automatically produced . Once I have a base list of colours , I give them a name and plug them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rest of the heavy lifting for me . <p> Sampling colours from photos is an idea that works well in print design , due to an implicit enabler once a page is printed , it never changes . On the web , this is a much more elusive practice . Thanks to content management systems and rotating image scripts and daily updates and the like , there are a number of reasons why its not practical to consider applying this concept to an entire web site . One great example of this being done well in the past is Nazarin Hamids Absenter , a beautifully sparse photoblog . <p> The obvious question here is , with a continuously-changing colour scheme , how diluted does the brand identity become ? There are certainly plenty of other unifying factors that diminish the difference in colour , from typography to layout to logo . <p> Ultimately this is a personal site . I 'm not so concerned about brand , and willing to take the risk for the sake of trying something new . <h> Inspiration <p> I think its fairly obvious , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when putting together this site . The layout , typography , and photo-derived colour schemes owe their existence to flipping through back issues of some of my favourite cooking mags . <p> The archiving idea was also a magazine-inspired derivation , but I cant say I would have made the connection if it had n't  been for recent archival experiments by Shaun Inman , with his Heap , and Khoi Vinh and his interest in illustrating archive pages . While I doubt anyone could make the case that our respective archival methods are closely related , the fact that these two gents set out down the road of extending our basic ideas on what a weblog archive page should look like proved useful to my own thought process , so hats off . <h> Photo Credits <p> Yep , the photos are all my own .

What are they good for ? Why are they there ? And why do n't  they work ? <p> While I and others are starting to look into suggestions for developers to alleviate this design flaw , I thought I 'd take a minute to talk about what this technology potentially means to you , the user . ( If you already know what RSS stands for , this article wont tell you anything new , but feel free to reference when you need to explain syndication . ) <p> RSS/XML/Atom are technologies , but syndication is a process . RSS and Atom are two flavours of what is more or less the same thing : a feed which is a wrapper for pieces of regularly and sequentially-updated content , be they news articles , weblog posts , a series of photographs , and more . For the purposes of this article , consider the terms interchangable . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but that 's almost totally irrelevant ; the orange buttons are mislabelled , and should read RSS or Atom instead . Strange , but true . <p> Syndication is the process of using RSS/Atom for automated updates , another way of getting the information you want . You no doubt have a list of web sites you browse daily for updates , whether they 're stored in your bookmarks or your head . If you find yourself loading 20 or 30 sites a day , and you notice if a few stop updating as frequently , you 'll inevitably stop checking them . <p> What if there were instead some way to have your list of bookmarks notify you when the sites you read have been updated ? You would n't waste time checking those that have n't . Instead of loading 30 sites a day , you might only need to load 13 . Cutting your time in half would enable you to start monitoring more sites , so for the same amount of time you originally invested in checking each site manually , you may just end up end up following twice as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A news reader , or aggregator as they 're also known , is a program or a web site that automatically checks your list of bookmarks ( which you only have to set up once ) and let 's you know what 's new on each site in your list . <p> It goes beyond simple updates though the news reader works by pulling in the feeds of your various bookmarks . As we covered above , a feed is a wrapper for content items , so on top of notification , a feed delivers the content that has been updated itself . You may choose to read the new content in the news reader , or you may choose to leave the reader and visit the site . Some authors will only provide summaries of the content , forcing you to visit anyway . <p> Beyond day to day use , a particularly nice feature is that you 're able to take your news with you on the go . Have your newsreader grab the latest feeds before you rush to the airport , then check out of the in-flight movie to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the author has to be providing full content for this to work , and some only provide summaries its about 50/50 . Leave the summaries unread , and you can come back to them later when you 're connected again . In this regard , news readers also function like temporary bookmarks . Unread items will stay flagged until you 're near a connection or have more time to read them . No more forgetting what it was you wanted to check up on your lunch break , itll be there waiting for you . <p> If this introduction has whet your appetite , the next step is to grab a news reader and start playing .

@@99593399 @3793399/ <p> This afternoon I was asked by a friend what I would recommend to an old designer who wants to learn more about web standards , CSS , XML , and XHTML . <p> This is a perfect example of when an email response is better posted here for a wider audience ( and Google ) . So here 's my answer : this is a comprehensive , informal , and somewhat long-winded roadmap for anyone who has heard about web standards , thinks they might want web standards , but does n't  know where to start . <p> Stop ! Before you do anything , the most important thing you can do for your learning process is accept that a ) its going to take time , and b ) you will be frustrated along the way . <p> But you 're not alone . Plenty of us who have taken the plunge into standards went through the same , and there is a growing body of work devoted to helping make your life easier . The old-timers had to figure out the hard way all the tricks and techniques @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in later ( myself included ) can benefit from their sweat and tears . <p> In the end , when your skill using standard-based design eclipses your skill using old-school table-based methods , you 'll look back and marvel at how much more sense it makes to layout a page with CSS . Oh sure , the actual methods used might not make much sense ( considering there are better options in the CSS2 spec than what we currently use ) but we have a major browser manufacturer to blame for their lack of support . <p> Uh , I seem to have wandered . Sorry , that 's another thing you 'll have to get used to : unbridled hostility against Internet Explorer . Itll take some experience to understand why , but you 'll know exactly what we mean in short order . <p> So . On to the practical information you can start using immediately . First , run and buy Designing With Web Standards . Do n't  even think about it , just do it . Got it ? Good , now do n't  let it collect dust read it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Its equal parts manifesto ( WHY would you want to do this ? ) and tutorial ( HOW do you do this ? ) . You need it . <p> Now . The first thing to do is get into an XHTML mindset . Whether you choose HTML 4.01 or XHTML 1.0 Strict ( there are reasons to go with either ; ignore them for now , and then ignore them even more , until you 're ready for some mind-numbing drudgery ) , it all begins with a DOCTYPE . Telling a browser which language your document is marked up with is n't only a good idea , it prevents unwanted rendering glitches that will otherwise drive you crazy . Think of it like this : if I want to fly to Chicago , I have to tell my travel agent of choice where I want to go . Sure , it might be fun to take my chances and see where I end up , but its not exactly practical . Setting a DOCTYPE ensures I get to my destination of choice without unintended side-trips to Vienna . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to grasp , actually . Always quote your attributes ( ie. &lt;a href= " link " &gt; , and &lt;input type= " text " /&gt; ) . Do n't  improperly nest tags ; close them in the order you opened them . And if you open a tag , close it again ; every tag , or element , requires an opening and a closing correspondent . <p> A quick diversion here : somewhere along the way , tags became elements . Same syntax , different theory . Call them what you will , the proper label is now element ; maybe it always has been . I do n't  know . No one ever explained this to me . <p> So anyway , each element needs to be closed properly . If you 're using HTML 4.01 , this does n't  include stand-alones like &lt;br&gt; , &lt;hr&gt; , and &lt;input&gt; . With XHTML , it does . There 's a hack-ish , but practical syntax that degrades gracefully in older browsers : just add a space and a slash to the end . &lt;br&gt; becomes &lt;br /&gt; , for example . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attributes : they always need to have a value , even when that value does n't  make sense . Example : &lt;input type= " radio " checked= " checked " /&gt; . You can get away with just checked in HTML 4.01 , but XHTML needs the redundancy . <p> Finally , XHTML requires all your code to be in lowercase . HTML does n't  differentiate , but XHTML uses XML syntax , which is case-sensitive . And the case ends up being lower . <p> That 's it for markup ! Youre done ! Take a breather , grab a cerveza , and chill out for the afternoon . Because that 's only step number one . <p> Why is validating important , or even relevant ? Because poorly-written markup is completely unpredictable ; you end up relying on a browsers error-handling , and even though most browsers are very good about this , its a bad practice to rely on it . Hey , its what got us into the non-standard , proprietary browser wars in the first place . ( Microsoft was able to compete with Netscape in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ errors exactly the same as Netscape . ) <p> The single point is , validating helps you spot errors in your code , which in turn ensures more consistent rendering of your page . The very first technique I try when debugging problematic layouts is validating my code . You should too . <p> Yeah , okay , its tough when you first validate your first site and get back a list of 78 arcane errors . Unfortunately , though the validator helps , its not perfect . Its run by volunteers who are doing their best , but sometimes the error messages are as helpful as Vogon poetry . The good news is that problems cascade , and if you can find one missing &lt;/p&gt; tag , for example , a lot of the time you bump that number down to 24 errors without doing anything else . The short of it : it looks bad , but its often not . <p> Now that you 're validating , you 're following the letter of the law . But as with many real-world laws , at this point you 're adhering to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bigger picture about why those guidelines are there in the first place . <p> The next step is to take this well-formed markup structure you 've built for your document , strip out the presentational attributes that have been deprecated in some of the more recent DOCTYPES , and move the presentation into a completely separate file . This is the infamous separation of structure and presentation , and this is where CSS comes into the picture . <p> Its like this : your text is content . Content is nice , but without any hints about the contents structure ( which includes things like spaces and headers and lists ) you end up with a jumbled mess of text . Completely unusable . Structure is an extra layer which breaks down that messy text into logical groupings and organizes them in a way that conveys extra information about individual elements in that document . How that information looks may be implied by the structure ( for example , you 'll most often find that a primary page heading will be larger than the body text ) but it does n't  dictate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Presentation is the formatting cue that tells the primary page header to be red , italicized , and 150% of the body copys size . Presentation is an extra layer of information on top of a documents structure , that builds up the ( non-visual ) structure into something far more appealing to the eye . CSS is the presentational layer , and it can take a very simpy marked up document , and turn it into something amazing view the css Zen Garden for a live demonstration of this in action . <p> So what 's the best way to start separating your presentation out of your structure ? Consider any HTML element or attribute that offers a visual cue to be an offending piece of legacy code . Its time to start killing those bgcolors and &lt;center&gt; tags . here 's a pop quiz : <p> In each of the following examples , which attributes and tags would you remove to eliminate all traces of presentational structure ? <p> Got your answers ready ? Great , compare to the list below . These are proper structural elements without a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ web site . &lt;/h1&gt; <p> &lt;table&gt; <p> &lt;body&gt; <p> **26;56;TOOLONG coming to take me away ... &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt; <p> That 's it ? That 's it . <p> While its not explicitly stated in any spec , a further goal of this separation is to use the proper elements for the job . Using a table to layout a page is then , by this definition , an improper use of a table . In the above example , it might have even been prudent to go further and remove the &lt;table&gt; and &lt;td&gt; elements , but its hard to say without surrounding context . Tables are n't  deprecated ; they can still be quite useful . But they should be used properly to contain data that 's structurally tabular . <p> So we 've stripped the formatting from our page . Hooray . What now ? Those are some ugly elements , all Times-New-Romaned and linear . Wheres the interest ? Wheres the compelling visuals we were promised ? <p> Head back to the Zen Garden example . See the lovely designs ? See how different they are ? The key here is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as your currently-unformatted document . No really , it is . <p> Having a bland and ugly base is a good thing , in fact . What you may have noticed is that this unformatted HTML looks an awful lot like the web of 1994 ( if you were around back then ) . In fact , with a few notable exceptions , that 's what it is . This stuff is as old as the web itself . &lt;h2&gt;s have been around since the days of Mosaic . Which , as you may have guessed by now , will still handle a properly-structured page with surprising fidelity . Try saying that about a late-90s table-fest . <p> The benefits do n't  end there of course . Accessibility to those with special needs is almost free , search engine optimization is built-in , bandwidth costs go way down ( along with development times ) , and on and on and on . Jeffrey Veen wrote up the Business Value of Web Standards late last year , and Roger Johansson expanded on the benefits and techniques of standards-based design with his recent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the major browsers today , and there are countless resources for learning the syntax , the basics of CSS layout , and the advanced theory behind high-impact CSS-based design .

Andrew Fernandez has indexed a huge listing of CSS resources that should help you no matter where your skill level is .

" <p> am i the only one who is concerned about this ? the proper way to refer to things just seems to change every now and then , and even though no one seems to know why , or even how , they are quick to make sure everyone else does it . <p> there almost seems to be a subtle strain leaning towards groupthink in the standards community which could prove to be a liability in the future , not to mention simply unfortunate for all the reasons that groupthink anywhere is unfortunate : ) <p> It seems to me that the proper terms are coming into more widespread use as people actually start paying attention to the specifications . The past few years seem to have started a shift away from the " bung a load of code together , and if it works in Both Browsers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been trying to explain this sort of thing to people for ages , and have always made a bit of a mess of it . What with the Zen Garden , which has always been a fantastic resourse for showing what can be done with CSS , this has just made my life a whole lot easier ! <p> The tags are the actual delimiters ; its rarely useful to talk about them , people usually mean " element " or " element type " when they talk about " tags " . <p> Think of the relationship between " element type " and " element " being the same as the relationship between " class " and " instance " , and " tags " being the equivelent of curly braces . <p> XHTML attribute redundancy : <p> I believe you need things like checked= " checked " , because in HTML , a bare checked is actually the attribute value , not the attribute name . It would make more sense to have something like checked= " true " , but that would void the HTML compatibility . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may omit their closing tags . <p> In X(HT)ML , all elements must have closing tags , though empty elements can have abbreviated " short " tags : &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; is equivalent to &lt;p /&gt; . Note that this abbreviation , is strictly speaking not legal HTML . In HTML , the closing tag is often optional ( and hence can just be omitted ) , but it ca n't be abbreviated as above . <p> " Whether you choose HTML 4.01 or XHTML 1.0 Strict ( there are reasons to go with either ; ignore them for now , and then ignore them even more , until you 're ready for some mind-numbing drudgery ) " <p> Aside from the bit about short tags , your advice holds equally well for both HTML 4 and XHTML 1.0 . But once you tell people to write &lt;img /&gt; instead of simply &lt;img&gt; , youd better tell them to slap an XHTML DOCTYPE on that puppy . <p> The first is a clear , concise introductory explanation of the box model for CSS formatting rules . The CSS and XHTML specs do a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ introduction in where the main gotchas are with default attribute values . For example , which element types are block and which are inline by default . What elements by default need to be contained within a &lt;p&gt; or &lt;div&gt; tag to be standards compliant without changing that the display attribute in the CSS for the element . What elements have attributes that you must clear in the CSS in order to get the desired result ? <p> These two things created issues that tripped me up the most when switching to standards compliance . <p> It should be noted that as of right now , XHTML should be avoided and you should stick to HTML 4.01 Strict unless you have a real need for XHTML ( like MathML ) . XHTML does n't  provide any advantages over HTML ( as far as I 've seen ) besides aformentioned ability to include other XML namespaces in it . <p> In addition , XHTML should be sent as application/xhtml+xml , which Everyones Favorite Browser chokes on . <p> Re : XHTML vs HTML . According to http : **34;84;TOOLONG XHTML 1.0 MAY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unless you have a very good reason . It is n't MUST NOT , which means something quite different . <p> I serve my XHTML 1.1 as text/html . My very good reason is that Everybodys Favourite Browser would otherwise choke on it : - ) <p> I prefer XHTML 1.1 as it is the most strict flavour - which helps to keep me on the straight and narrow ! When I was converting to a CSS layout , using XHTML 1.1 helped me pick out most of the layout stuff in the HTML so I could put it where it belonged - in the style sheet . <p> " I purposely glossed over the MIME type issue because it 's completely moot in 2004 . This is n't the time or place to argue the merits of HTML over XHTML . " <p> Its not moot , its simply irrelevant to what *most* people want to do with ( X ) HTML . Those who care about the *technical* benefits of using XHTML care about MIME-type issues . <p> For the other 99% of the web-authoring population , MIME-types are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the former has a simpler syntax , presumably making it easier to learn to author *correctly* . <p> thanks for this . I was about to write a similar article with a slightly different audience in mind . In fact , reading your article , I think its suitable for both the table-jockey and the web virgin , so I probably wont bother ! Ill paste the foreword here though , so you can see what I had in mind . Please do n't  inerpret any of this as a dig at your fantastic roadmap , which I had n't  read when I wrote this ! I 'd be interested in any comments . <p> Preface . <p> Imagine this is a school textbook . If you 're the kind of person who did n't  read prefaces in textbooks , do n't  read this . <p> This article is written for an audience free of the emotional baggage of table-jockeys and the histrionics of gurus ; a virginal audience that just wants to learn how to design modern web sites . This is me , one year ago . <p> It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing things other than the accessible , usable , semantically-meaningful , valid way striven for today . There are no snide references to broken browsers ( except when the extant version is still broken ) . It does n't  impeach the reader for sins they never committed . <p> One year ago , all these things elicited from me were , " Huh ? " <p> It avoids these history lessons to provide a well-marked path of least resistance to modern web design for the untainted but computer-literate . If you initially take this path but wander off into the pretty woodland and dangerous swamps then your mileage may vary . But if , like me , you get off on acquiring useless knowledge then you may have more fun . <p> For me , one year ago , the many references to not doing it like we used to , or to educating clients stuck in 1997 , or to doing the Right Thing were strictly *unnecessary* . It is *possible* to teach the Only Thing . <p> As an example , mentioning that tables were ever used for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three purposes , one good , and two bad : <p> - Its a useful counter-example when explaining semantic design - It buries a seed that table layout is quick and easy ( which is the oft-cited response of the Platonic antagonist the writer is attempting to convert ) . - It takes up time that is initially better spent learning the basics . <p> I 'm not suggesting the bad old days should be forgotten or hidden . Security through obscurity does not work . I 'm not saying there is n't a very large audience that needs and wants to be *re*-educated . <p> I 'm merely trying to provide a quick and easy route to our way of doing things for web virgins , lest they do it another way , or perhaps even worse , they do n't  bother at all . <p> That was a great intro , and those articles that you linked to will be a great help to sell web standards to others . Ive been working with web standards for a couple months now , and it can be frustrating , but once you get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tags , quoting attributes etc it comes pretty quick and easily . <p> For people who think it is too hard , or takes longer to code it really is n't once you get the hang of it plus it looks so much prettier when you view the source of your page and it is all nicely formed as opposed to the blob of text that tables and dynamic sites can generate . <p> Oh yeah , the other thing that is great about using web standards , is that you get used to not using browser-specific tags , and it is much much easier to create cross-browser compatible sites . now IE is the real pain in the ***. it would be nice if Microsoft added some standards support to IE 6 with XP SP2. but it probably is n't too likely so I think well be dealing with it for a while to come . <p> The XML flavor of HTML has many benefits over SGML-ized HTML . I 'm currently writing some JavaScripts* which fix IEs CSS handling to some extent but its necessary to use some XML features in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SGML . <p> Furthermore , XHTML is more portable beyond the web because it is " just XML " : XSL ( FOoT ) style sheets can used to make PDF , Docbook , or other XHTML web pages . Several of the high-quality and cheaper ( than SGML ) XML editors can be used to edit and store those documents . And there are no document structure ambiguities ( unlike HTML which could have no html , head , or closing tags among others ) , which makes XHTML easier to parse in the future ( when you have to deal with legacy document in XHTML 1.0 , and transform them to XHTML 10.01A , etcetera ) . <p> This is a tremendous article , and addresses some of the issues that I 've been debating on a recent project of mine ( http : //www.practicalcss.com ) in which I 'm trying to work out a basic standards-compliant " template " of sorts . <p> Standards should be fundamental to web development . Ive been heartened by the noise made in the past couple of years about standards-compliant design . Generally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , standards are becoming an accepted part of the web development scene . CSS-based design has achieved a firm and permanent position alongside table- and graphic-based design and one is slowly outpacing the other . <p> " but it 's necessary to use some XML features in the script** . That 's impossible , by definition , in SGML . " <p> I 'm not sure what you mean , as XML is a strict subset of SGML . <p> Furthermore , unless you serve your document with an XML MIME-Type ( application/xhtml+xml ) , then it will be processed by the browsers SGML parser in *all* current browsers . <p> " Furthermore , XHTML is more portable beyond the web because it is just XML : XSL ( FOoT ) style sheets can used to make PDF , Docbook , or other XHTML web pages . Several of the high-quality and cheaper ( than SGML ) XML editors can be used to edit and store those documents . " <p> This is an imortant point . Just because it is *possible* to do everything with SGML that you can do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tools for doing so . <p> Just as the simpler syntax of XML makes it easier for humans to learn ( IMO ) , it has also become more popular to write tools for . <p> Thus there are many more technologies and automated tools for manipulating XML documents than SGML documents . In the long run , that certainly makes it a better platform ( unless you are willing to write your own tools , or pay through the nose for someone else to write them ) . <p> That 's a powerful argument , but not one that is relevant to the " 99% " Dave was aiming at . As a rule , the people who care about namespaces and other advanced features of XHTML are the same ones who care about MIME-Types , etc. the sort of esoterica that Dave explicitly wanted to sidestep . <p> " And there are no document structure ambiguities ( unlike HTML which could have no html , head , or closing tags among others ) " <p> These are *not* document structure ambiguities . The rules of SGML syntax are more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> And what , the IE team is sequestered in a deep underground bunker with no access to the Internet ? <p> I mean , the bugs in IE are well-known . Entire cottage industries are devoted to developing workarounds for IEs broken CSS support , IEs lack of support for PNG transparency , etc . <p> The IE team is *surely* already aware of the serious bugs in their browser . Theyd have to be either brain-dead , or cut off from the Internet to be unaware . <p> I do n't  doubt Scobles sincerity , but this is a little like those non-functioning thermostats they install in individual offices in large office buildings to give the occupants an illusory sense of control over their environment . <p> Personally , I cant even get excited about the IE team " fixing " bugs . So what if they do ? Is that going to change our coding habits ? Probably not . IE6 is going to be the defacto browser for YEARS . The way I see it , IE7 will just be another browser that needs to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do that , since I do n't  plan on upgrading ) <p> My assumption is that we better get used to the current browsers , because this is the way it is going to be for awhile . Firebird 3 and Opera 15 might be fantastic , but I still fear we will have to deal with IE6 in a decade . Heck , many organizations that should know better still have Netscape 4.7 installed . <p> Like many other posters ( were all up on a wall somewhere ? ! ) , I recently discovered the thrill of standards compliance . Now I wonder , how can we get more web developers to abandon the non-compliant practices that are so prevalent ? <p> Thanks for the summary , Dave . I am now adhering as best i can to standards , using xhtml 1.0 trans and an external stylesheet. my sites validate for now . but i have only recently begun to see references to MIME types . can someone point me to a reference about what a MIME type is and why it is important ? if i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i missing something ? thanks in advance . <p> explains *why* . ( The bottom line is that , if you serve XHTML as text/html , *even* if you validate everything , your site may still break horribly if you were to switch to application/xhtml+xml . The only way to ensure your site will work when served with the correct MIME type is to actually serve it that way . ) <p> Great article , I shall be pointing a few colleagues in this direction . I have one little comment to make , I thought this line in parapgraph 9 was a little confusing " close tags in the order you opened them " . <p> This should read " close tags in the REVERSE order you opened them " . If you closed your tags in the order you opened them , you may end with something like this : <p> *how can we get more web developers to abandon the non-compliant practices that are so prevalent ? * <p> Good freakin question . What do we do with a web designer like my boss who says things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know what ?

@@99593401 @3793401/ <p> Unlike the first run , were now looking forward instead of back . IE9 is your minimum cutoff on the desktop , otherwise target the most recent versions of other desktop browsers . You should test your work on mobile browsers as well ; recent iOS and Android browsers should be on your testing list . All designs should have the proper vendor prefixes where required work that is -webkit- prefixed only is not acceptable . <p> Can I use CSS3 , responsive , etc. in my design ? <p> Yes ! Forget the old browser requirements and CSS limitations , modern responsive designs and CSS3 are all acceptable , and even expected . Rounded corners , shadows , transitions , etc. are all just fine . ( Make sure to see the note about prefixes above , however . ) <p> Can I use web fonts in my design ? <p> Yes , but please ensure your license allows you to distribute them on a publicly-available site . In most cases this means you should limit yourself to free fonts ; due to the way the Zen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ viable ( but perhaps one day they will be . ) <p> How do I submit my design on GitHub ? <p> If you 're reading this , let 's assume you know how GitHub works . The repo is here ; clone a copy , create a new branch ( do n't  skip the new branch step ) , and add your design as a new top-level folder the same way the other ones exist . Submit your branch as a pull request , and well have a look . If none of that made sense , just use the standard form . And you probably wo n't get the exact number or folder name you submitted as if your design is chosen . <p> How do I get in touch with a certain designer ? <p> Follow the link to their own site , and use the contact options there . If the site no longer exists , we cant get in touch with them either . No really . Ten years is a long time on the internet . <p> Where did this idea come from ? <p> Its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Inspired in roughly equal parts by Chris Cascianos Daily CSS Fun , the Hack Hotbot contest , and an independent idea I 've had stuck in my head forever , I finally committed to creating this . <p> Who created it ? <p> Dave Shea , a web designer from Vancouver , Canada . <p> Why a page refresh when loading new styles ? <p> Its tempting to think it could be handled with a Javascript style switcher instead of the current server-side method . There are two important reasons why its better not to : 1 ) you can bookmark each style this way . 2 ) the Javascript method only adds to the existing style , instead of replacing it . A flush would be necessary to clear each one , and the simplest way to achieve this just happens to be a page refresh . <p> How do I view each designs CSS ? <p> There 's a convenient link under the Resources header titled View This Designs CSS . Guess what that does ? <p> Yes , it may . See this article for why the fancy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go so well together . However , starting from submission 11 or so , all new designs must account for at least two font sizes larger than the default . Hopefully this will satisfy any font scaling urges . <p> How are you switching style sheets like that ? <p> The Zen Garden uses a customized PHP script to allow for maximum flexibility . You may download that script in PHP or ASP formats and use it freely in your own work . Alternatively , there exists an excellent Javascript style switcher available from A List Apart that uses cookies to keep a selected style persistent . <p> Can I use these designs for other things ? <p> You may not use any of the graphics ( image files : GIF , JPG , and PNG ) on the Zen Garden elsewhere without the original designer 's written permission . There are no exceptions to this . The Garden is about learning from other people 's work , but not using it uncompensated . While the CSS files themselves are provided as-is under a very open Creative Commons license , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your own designs instead of using them as a basis for your work . Go ahead and learn from the files , and grab bits and pieces of the CSS as you need them . But if you 're using the bulk of the original . css file and only changing a few colours and images , you 're basically cloning the design . Please e-mail the designer for permission before doing this , and respect their wishes if they prefer that you do n't . <p> Is the CSS Zen Garden fully accessible ? <p> Probably not . The markup is as semantic as possible and WAI-ARIA roles have been added where appropriate . The " A11y " link on the main Zen Garden page even used to point to automated tests that checked the Zen Gardens markup for AAA/Section 508 compliance . It passed , but these validators are no longer available . <p> But even with those measures , accessibility was not necessarily achieved . The WCAG guidelines contain multiple checkpoints which can not be tested automatically ; they require a judgment call made by a human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ text from the browser , fonts sized with the px unit ) which are by nature inaccessible , so the CSS of any particular design is as relevant as the markup when it comes to accessibility . <p> In some cases and with certain designs , the Zen Garden may come close to achieving AAA compliance . But we cant in good conscience say that the Zen Garden is a fully accessible site , since we now need such a long disclaimer . <p> What ever happened to that big huge list of designs ? <p> Its still around . The current design list only features the " official " designs , meaning those that are hosted at csszengarden.com itself . Previously every single design submitted was linked in the main archives , but now only official designs will be .

Ladies and gentlemen , I give to you the amazing journey from one server-side technology to another . Youll be amazed , you 'll be awed , you 'll laugh , you 'll cry . You 'll okay , so my writing style needs to calm down a touch . <p> Ive been working on this on and off for months now , and I meant to have it up far earlier than this . Some of the final details are fuzzy at this point , but the bulk of it is on target . <p> This is the process I went through when upgrading my Movable-Type powered site from IIS ( and ASP ) to Apache ( and PHP ) , from start to finish . For the benefit of Google , and you the reader , I 'll try to spare no detail . Much the same as I ended up blessing the kind souls who have written up their own experiences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answer they need somewhere in this . <h> Why I Switched <p> I originally set up mezzoblue on an IIS host because ASP is what I knew . I am not a programmer , but the odd time I needed to fool around with code it had to be something that I could easily use . <p> When I created BlueSpark ( a free , light-weight ASP-based content management system : think server-side Notepad ) I realized even my knowledge of that was only rudimentary at best . So reasons to stay on IIS quickly eroded , and I found myself wanting to get into PHP about two or three months ago . Why PHP over ASP ? Momentum , baby . All the cool toys are written in PHP , and more importantly , a large chunk of them are open . <p> I 'm no anti-Microsoft zealot , but I see huge advantages to working with open source software . Now that I 'm actually on an Apache server I can say that custom . htaccess files are a hugely important thing to have , and IISs handling of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be plenty of other little gems I 'll discover as I play more . <h> How I Learned <p> So cut to about a month ago . In my copious , vast amounts of spare time I started thumbing through a Peachpit press book by Larry Ullman : " PHP and MySQL For Dynamic Web Sites . " If you 're familiar with C/C++/Javascript syntax , you 'll easily breeze through the first 50 or 60 pages . In fact , I skipped to Appendix A which covers installation , and with a little help from the manuals I managed to get Apache , PHP , and MySQL up and running on my spare Windows laptop one evening . <p> By the time I was a hundred pages into the book , I 'd already started working on converting mezzoblue . There are n't  many scripts , and a lot of the work involved rebuilding my main three server-side includes . I had n't  really dealt much with the content pages within , I had only laid the foundation . <h> What to Do When Things Go South , or : Motivation <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acting up . Reliability decreased over a good week , and then one day things just stopped working about 80% of the time . It was down , then up , then down again . My hosts site suffered the same problems , so I could n't even file a claim to see what was going on . Needless to say , when I finally got an answer it was less than satisfactory . <p> So I started investigating hosts . I need generous bandwidth and storage space , but I do n't  use a lot of server processor time . Unfortunately , the amount of bandwidth I use gets lumped into higher-end accounts . But Matt Mullenweg made me an offer I literally could n't refuse , so I jumped . <h> Static Conversion <p> But that 's only the beginning , of course . I had a host . Now to port Movable Type , and rebuild my site on Apache . Well , let 's just say this wasnt as easy as I had hoped it would be , but it did n't  turn into the disaster I had feared it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from my IIS server earlier in the week , and I was irritable enough with the downtime that I decided to jump in head first and initiate the domain transfer . I put up my pre-built PHP page with an apology message for the next day or two of downtime , and went to work . I started with the static content , that was easy enough . I plugged in my new iBook and grabbed a copy of BBEdit Lite , and started re-linking . <p> The nice thing about server-side includes , of course , is that all your standard site-wide bits like headers and footers and sidebars and the like can be stored externally in their own individual files . The upshot in this case is that a lot of my static content looked like so : <p> inlude files , content , include files <p> Not a lick of content had to be changed , all I had to do was re-link the new include files , which , if you 've been paying attention , I had already built last month . Copy , paste , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ test . That was a fun evening , at least in comparison to what happened next . <h> Movable Type , or , How to Make a Bad Thing Worse <p> Now here 's where I hit the big snag . Equal parts assumption and hope had led me to try uploading the entire Movable Type install to my new server . After all , MT is Perl-based and should work without a hitch . I made sure server-detection in my FTP program was automatic ( since its very important you 're not uploading . cgi files as binaries ) , dropped the works onto the server , re-linked Perl and the appropriate user directories , set my permissions , and loaded the MT interface . <p> Nothing . <p> Well , not nothing , but not a lot more : Error 500 , internal server error . Not helpful . I double-checked my paths and my permissions , then tried again . Still nothing . In a fit of desparation I dropped one of the . db files into a text editor and noticed that there were paths in those consistent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this point . <p> Remember how about I stated I 'm no programmer ? I was stuck at this point . Luckily , I have what we commonly refer to as problem-solving skills so I came up with a few more plans . You may laugh , you may cringe , but at this point they seemed worth a shot . <p> Next up on the list : re-installing MT , then dropping the old data directory , db , on top of the new install in hopes that the interface would just recognize the old data and think everything was okay . But I could n't login to Movable Type after doing it . I reverted back to the freshly installed db directory , and was able to login fine . I tried selectively dumping a couple of the larger . db files into the new directory , but had no luck doing that either . <h> DNS Trickery <p> So I still had the archives , but no way of getting at them . Hmm . I was smart enough not to cancel my prior hosting account , so I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old server . <p> A day or two of waiting for propogation , then I was able to log in to my old MT interface , manually export my entries and comments thanks to Six Aparts clear thinking about not locking users in , save my customized templates , then switch DNS back to the new server . <p> At this point the cards started stacking back in my favour again . My new server gives me a static IP , so I was able to point my copies of Firebird and Safari toward it without waiting for the propogation . I set to work getting the old entries imported into my fresh install , and added my templates through the interface . <p> Which is not to say this process was n't without its share of trouble even though I temporarily pointed Movable Type toward the IP instead of the domain , I was n't able to access everything . When saving entries or comments , for example , the refresh would go to a non-existent page on mezzoblue.com . This was only a minor inconvenience though , since the data @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world to catch up , I was hard at work plugging the holes and making sure things would be up and running by the time the DNS change went through . <p> At this point I made a valiant attempt to switch from Movable Types default Berkely DB system to MySQL , since that was the other half of the equation . However , since I needed a quick fix , my inexperience with the latter got in the way and I eventually conceded that to a later date . Bigger fish to fry , after all . <h> Summary <p> So while I showed some foresight , the process was hardly as smooth as it could have been . For a few days , I was n't able to do much in the way of posting new content , and a static page greeted visitors to the site . Effectively , I was knocked offline as I waited for the jump to and from and then to my new host , although during that time most were still able to access one server or another . <p> Ive been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see myself going back . I have n't even begun to scratch the surface of the things I can do , but its comforting to know that if I need to , they 're there . At least I 'm in the happy spot of being able to blame shortcomings on lack of brainpower , rather than lack of horsepower . That , in my books , is the easiest of the two to fix . 30451 @qwx890451 <p> You are reading " ASP to PHP , with MT to Boot ! " , an entry made on 2 December , 2003 , filed under " Server-Side " .

@@99593405 @3793405/ <p> The main page header of this guide is an h1 element . Please reserve h1 for individual page titles only . Any header elements may include links , as depicted in the example . <p> The secondary header above is an h2 element , which may be used for any form of important page-level header . More than one may be used per page . Consider using an h2 unless you need a header level of less importance , or as a sub-header to an existing h2 element . Any header level may include links , as depicted in the example . <h> Third-Level Header <p> The header above is an h3 element , which may be used for any form of page-level header which falls below the h2 header in a document hierarchy . More than one may be used per page . <h> Sixth-Level Header <h> Paragraphs <p> All paragraphs are wrapped in p tags . Additionally , p elements can be wrapped with a blockquote element if the p element is indeed a quote . Historically , blockquote has been used purely to force indents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blockquote for quotes . Here 's an example of correct usage : <p> Additionally , you might wish to cite the source , as in the above example . ( The correct method involves the cite attribute directly applied to the blockquote element , but since no browser makes any use of that information whatsoever , it 's useful to also specify the standalone cite element . ) <h> Inline Text <p> You might have noticed all the monospaced text in this guide . There are a number of inline HTML elements you may use anywhere within other elements , including abbr , acronym , cite , code , del , em , ins , kbd , strong , and var . <p> abbr <p> Used for any abbreviated text , whether it be acronym , initialism , or otherwise . Generally , it 's less work and useful ( enough ) to mark up only the first occurence of any particular abbreviation on a page , and ignore the rest . Any text in the title attribute will appear when the user 's mouse hovers the abbreviation ( although @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Windows ) . Example abbreviations and usage : NASA , HTML , and Mass . <p> acronym <p> Used for only specific abbreviations . Like abbr , any text in the title attribute will appear when the user 's mouse hovers the acronym ( unlike abbr , however , this does work in Internet Explorer for Windows . ) According to Mirriam Webster , acronyms are : <p> ... a word ( as NATO , radar ... ) formed from the initial letter or letters of each of the successive parts or major parts of a compound term ; also : an abbreviation ( as FBI ) formed from initial letters . <p> If you think the difference between acronym and abbr is esoteric , you 're probably right . <p> Inline usage : just like elsewhere in this document , HTML elements like em or code can be considered code , and marked up as such . <p> cite <p> Used for defining a citation or reference to other information sources . Example cited text and usage : More information can be found in ISO-0000 <p> del <p> Used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the page for some reason . Since the default style includes a strikethrough line , it 's preferable to the s element . The del element also has a datetime attribute which allows you to include a timestamp directly in the element . Example deleted text and usage : She bought twofive pairs of shoes . <p> em <p> Used for denoting emphasized text . In most instances where you 'd want to italicize text ( using the HTML element i or otherwise ) you should use the em element instead . Notable exceptions are stylistic italicizing of proper titles , foreign languages , etc. where italicizing is used for differentiation instead of emphasis . In those cases , no proper HTML elements exist , so an i element or a span element with a custom class may be preferable . Example emphasized text and usage : You simply must try the negitoro maki ! <p> ins <p> Used for inserted text and counterpart to the del element . Like del , ins has a datetime attribute which allows you to include a timestamp directly in the element . Example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoes . <p> kbd <p> Used for text which should be typed by the user . Mainly useful for computer instructions . Example keyboard text and usage : Please press Enter to continue . <p> strong <p> Used for denoting stronger emphasis than the em element . In most instances where you 'd want to bold text ( using the HTML element b or otherwise ) you should use the strong element instead . Notable exceptions are stylistic bolding of examples , first occurences of names in an article , etc. where bolding is used for differentiation instead of emphasis . In those cases , no proper HTML elements exist , so b element or a span element with a custom class may be preferable . Example strong text and usage : Do n't stick nails in the electrical outlet . <p> var <p> Used for variables within computer code snippets . Useful for technology-oriented sites , not so useful otherwise . Example code and usage : Add 5 to $result and recalculate . <h> Lists <p> Then there are the lists . ul denotes an unordered list ( ie. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or a bulleted list ) . ol denotes an ordered list , and various numbering schemes are available through the CSS ( including 1,2,3 ... a , b , c ... i , ii , iii ... and so on ) . Each item within the ul or ol requires a surrounding &lt;li&gt; and &lt;/li&gt; tag , to denote individual items within the list ( as you may have guessed , li stands for list item ) . <p> Additionally , dl is another list type called a definition list . Instead of list items , the content of a dl consists of dt ( Definition Term ) and dd ( Definition description ) pairs . Though it may be called a " definition list " , dl can apply to other scenarios where a parent/child relationship is applicable . For example , it may be used for marking up dialogues , with each dt naming a speaker , and each dd containing his or her words . <p> Example lists and usage : <p> This is an unordered list . <p> It has two items . <p> This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> No , I lied , it has three . <p> This is a term . <p> This is the definition of that term , which both live in a dl . <p> Here is another term . <p> And it gets a definition too , which is this line . <p> Here is term that shares a definition with the term below . <p> Here is a defined term . <p> dt terms may stand on their own without an accompanying dd , but in that case they share descriptions with the next available dt . You may not have a dd without a parent dt.

If they 're not having luck , given their marketing budget and that they cater to an audience who responds enthusiastically , then a loosely gathered group of volunteers trying to lure people away from their current browsers wont make much of a dent . <p> Its tempting to call this particular comparison apples and oranges . Switching or upgrading an Operating System requires a hell of a lot more commitment and money to upgrade apps , not to mention the difficulty in rollbacks if things go awry . In reality , the scope is different but the underlying mindset is the same . " This is what I use . Its what I 'm comfortable with . Leave me alone . " <p> I believe he s dead on about browsers : the end user @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Which is why the Luxury Web concept focused on selling features , rather than selling browsers . But since , as Zeldman points out , this is precisely what others have tried and failed , then even that rudimentary thinking on the subject must be flawed . <p> My original thought was a reaction . It was a well we cant just sit here and take it , we have to do something ! The percentage of the population that fails to vote each election have no right to complain about their elected leaders if they do n't  speak up when they have the chance ; it was my attempt at voting . <p> So what do we do now ? No one but Microsoft is going to be content with letting the situation stand . Rapid evolution and occasional revolution have been a given in the computer industry for decades .

The question is : how ? 30454 @qwx890454 <p> When the obvious is explored , true creativity can shine . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the current situation is not likely to change , MS won . However , this will give other browsers more time to catch up and get to the level of IE6 ( like screenreaders , pdas etc ) . So in the end this wont probably defeat the purpose of CSS based webdesign . <p> Since XP came out , my strategy has been to send as many of those error reports to MS as I couldI figure theyd get the point and fix stuff , but alas , its probably going to the vast nether of emptiness like all those Santa letters . <p> I just got onto this CSS bandwagon today , so there is hope . As the number of people creating CSS based sites increases the probability that MS will cater to us will increaselogically thinking , of course .

And that 's the main reason why IE 5. x and 6. x will be around for a long , long time for most things , its perfectly alright . OK , so it ca n't handle a transparent PNG . So what ? Its a pain to me as a web developer , but Joe and Jane Average couldnt care less , even if they did know what PNG meant . <p> Until there is a competing browser with capabilities way beyond IE , then it will continue to be the way most people browse the web .

@@99593408 @3793408/ <p> Youll note , as you start poking through the source code , that most of these contain the odd table or two . You 'll also notice that most come close to validation , but do n't  quite succeed . <p> These are real-world examples . Waxing theoretical about the benefits of pure and valid markup is fine , but when crunch time comes this is almost always the reality . Wired and ESPN do not validate . Cingular was never perfect , and is quite a mess now . <p> What can be said for the tables ? Transitional layouts are still necessary today , given project requirements . Some visual effects can not work reliably between the major browsers . Others can not be done without CSS3 . Its fun to think of a day when all browsers everywhere will handle every layout exactly the same . Its also fun to think of a day when well have flying cars and full meals in convenient pill format . <p> As has been noted elsewhere , we the people who are doing this for a paycheque face reality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we make the choices that work . This is not always consistent with the " right " choice . <p> Commercial web design will continue to be about compromise . Nine times out of ten , the more effective use of the clients dollar goes toward building and refining content over validating every last tag . Not to say that the two are incompatible , but between spending $500 on purifying their source or creating additional ads for off-site promotion , guess which most clients perceive as the most value for that money ? <p> This is no excuse not to strive for the end goal of a compliant site . But it is a polite reminder to those who would find fault in others who , through factors they have no control over , can only go 95% of the way . <p> Theory is nice , in theory . But providing the best solution involves knowing that sometimes , its okay to break the rules . 30454 @qwx890454 <p> Funny , I just went for a walk around the block to ease my frustration at working in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greater import than getting something done right . Your consolation is quite apropos . Cheers Dave . <p> I hear ya on this one , Dave . Though tableless structure is a spectacular goal , and one to strive for , sometimes that 's just not practical . The site that I am commissioned to oversee was coded by a monkey before me , and the site is huge with constant content updates . Then , to make matters worse , the content management system that is going in in a month is based on tabled layouts , giving the desigers no access to head , css , or other important table killing tags . But do I " sin in the eyes of the almighty web standards deity " for a paycheck ? Heck yeah . I wish there was another way , but sometimes , as you noted , it just is n't . <p> P.S. - glad your site is back up . Looks good to me . I wonder what 's with that " every 4th refresh " thing . That 's just flat out weird <p> noid rather get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ubiquitous reality and css rendering is consistent across all browsers ; ) <p> yup , when it comes to real life , weve all got to make sacrifices . transitional layouts with one or two ( non-nested ) tables is ok in most situationsand in future the content can still be **28;152;TOOLONG into pure table-less code without too much hassle ( which cant always be said of tagsoup ) . <p> heck , if it pays my bills , ill roll over and do a 100% flash site held together in a nested table , if that 's what it takes <p> By the way let us not forget that the W3C drafts recommendations . We are not talking about the law here where ( strict ) rules should be followed to avoid punishment . <p> There is no right or wrong in webdesign ( as such ) . However there is good and bad . We all know by now that huge bandwidth sucking flash intros with bad techno music are a big no-no . We also know that we will have to drop tables for presentation some time in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these examples are not wrong as such , they are just not a very good idea . <p> Let us cheer at those that implement CSS-based design into commercial projects instead of flaming them for not following W3C recommendations a la lettre . In the end the real-world is indeed more complex . <p> Beautiful article . Ive been dealing with the eventual compromise between elegant standards following code and just making things work . CSS is great and all , I love it to death , but its much like giving up my working peice of junk car for a brand new mercedes that only has two tires and I have to drive with my feet . <p> Look for logos with blue/navy circles or half circles . You 'll find millions . See EDS and Express-Scripts . How many logos out there look like a representation of Saturn ( which mimics the circle/half circle premise ) ? Most logos out there are generic by nature to make them easily remembered by the masses . Plus there 's just so many ideas out there and its pretty easy to duplicate an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of true statements here , but I have to admit that most of the time not having valid code is mostly a matter of laziness and lack of familiarity . God knows Ive done my share of non-validating pages but I admit that its usually because I have run out of steam by the end of a project and I just do n't  really care that much . Whenever I have set about making valid pages , I almost always accomplish it . <p> eric , i completely disagree that its because of laziness or lack of familiarity . i consider myself meticulous when coding sites , and i 'm quite knowledgable with standards-code. here are a few reasons why most of the sites dave listed do n't  validate : <p> - CMS issues - sometimes my company ca n't pick the CMS a client uses , and the CMS we have to use does n't  spit out proper code . this happens in the majority of the examples above . <p> - links - some of the links on those sites have chrs in them that cause the validator to output @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ external sites ( i.e. amazon , referral programs , etc ) , nothing can be done about that . <p> - form submissions that submit to external sites that contain invalid code . again , since the form submits to registrar , there 's nothing we can do about the code being invalid . <p> - another big one is clients that do minor edits via frontpage/dreamweaver/ ( insert crappy wysiwyg ) editor here . once we 've handed a site off to a client on their servers , were not responsible for it validating forever , unless we get paid to . <p> Paul , you can make your links validate by encoding them properly . You do n't  need to change the URL ; it just needs to be encoded the like any other text in an HTML/XHTML document ( e.g. change &amp; to &amp;amp ; ) . <p> Similarly , most of the stats scripts Ive seen can be made to validate just by escaping characters correctly ( generally by adding backslashes to special characters in Javascript ) . <p> I do n't  understand why forms to external sites @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the form fields and values are still the same , what prevents you from correcting errors in the markup ? <p> This leaves CMS systems and client editing , which I agree have no good solutions . <p> This is so accurate . When reading some html newsgroups , people get on their high horse and preach how things MUST be done and I wonder if theyve ever had to work in a corporate environment . Comprimise is everything but its nice to see things heading in the right direction . On a side note , anyone notice that the logo for Firewhite is very close to Watchfire ( http : //www.watchfire.com/ ) ? <p> jonathan : i think stylized flames in general are very popular , and i could probably find a bunch of sites with similar logos. my company did n't  design it though , so i do n't  know . it looks more like a similar style than a copy though . <p> I agree that CMS systems and client editing can be bad , but I do n't  include these when I say " my pages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are n't  really mine . As mentioned , links can ( and should ) be encoded . <p> Third party scripts can be changed , because they are typically done by someone you or the client is paying , and if they have some bad code , you often have leverage to fix it ( at least with larger clients ) . If you inspect the code prior to making a commitment , you can also use this as criteria in your selection process . <p> eric , i think what dave is trying to say is that the real-world projects differ from joe blow who codes his blog and makes it valid through the css validator. real-world projects are run within a budget and within a deadline . blogs do n't  have a budget or timeline . <p> itd be great to get things perfect , but projects are like term papers . you can try to make the paper as perfect as possible , but the night before the deadline , you 've got to make a decision on either submitting a late-yet-perfect project or an **26;182;TOOLONG project . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Real World " , an entry posted on 24 September , 2003 , to the No 1 collection .

@@99593410 @3793410/ <p> However , a sharp surge of immediate adoption could be a little painful for those not currently testing in IE7 ; now is most definitely the time to start , if that 's you . ( Hey , do n't  feel bad , I still only have IE7 beta 1 myself . ) <p> Also , as of the launch ( no set date yet , some time in Q4 is the current best guess ) , I have a strong feeling the case for testing in IE5.x will be unjustifiably hard to make in most cases . Enjoy your last few months of the box model hack . <p> What about Windows 2000 users ? They will most likely still be behind on IE6 , which is n't exactly good news . I wonder what Microsoft will plan to do about the non-profit organizations , corporate users , etc . <p> This is good news , but MS are also releasing a tool to block the update : <p> " Additionally , Microsoft on Wednesday plans to make available a special tool to block automatic delivery of the new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for business users who might not be ready for an IE update . " ZDNet - LONG ... <p> That is really great news . However I do worry that well end up in a situation where all those on IE6 will upgrade to IE7 , but all those still stuck in IE5 will still be stuck in IE5 , thus widening the gap even more . Ive been thinking about this for a while , but when IE7 launches , maybe it would be time for another browser upgrade campaign ? <p> A bunch of us were talking about this very issue last week at WebVisions , and the general wish was that MS would do what theyve just announced . <p> Were past the point of another official browser upgrade campaign : what we need to do now is stop supporting IE versions earlier than 6 ( and by " stop supporting " I mean give them the content , but not the experience just give pre-IE6 versions an unstyled page , or at most a minimal style that does n't  require much effort to develop or maintain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinking about scaling back support for IE6 ( I 'm giving that serious consideration already with some projects ) , and focusing on IE7 as the soon-to-be-current version . <p> Though a tiny little notice at the top of sites visited by IE6 users , encouraging them to either upgrade to IE7 or use Firefox , would n't be a bad idea once IE7 ships : P <p> Dan , I think a better idea would be to serve a styled page , but with a ( fairly ) prominent option to turn off the stylesheeting . It might be a desirable option for standards-compliant browsers , but primarily because it offers older browsers or ones that that you do n't  explicitly support a fair swing at rendering to the standard . If they ca n't hack it , they have a usable fallback . <p> My biggest gripe at the moment is default deny on rendering pages rather than default permit . For instance , Opera gets a ur browser is teh suck at oldnavy.com without even a fair shot at using the page . I 'm 99% sure that Opera can hack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ list , I 'm not allowed to visit their site . I cant say I 'm too broken up , though . <p> There 's a big difference between we do n't  support and we do n't  allow . Be a we do n't  supporter rather than a we do n't  allower . <p> I have just installed IE7 Beta 3 , and it has caused me problems already . My site is showing errors similar to Opera and Safari . So does this mean Firefox is behind ? <p> I have also noticed that Dan Cederholms SimpleBits has some graphical glitches in it too . This is not to say that Dan has suddenly lost the touch , but it sets bells ringing for me that IE7 Beta 3 is still not ideal . <p> @ Nick : I 'm not advocating a default deny approach , just giving older browsers a lower-end experience ( similar to how standards-based developers approached NS4 for a long time ) . I 'd rather display a clearly scaled-down version than something that almost works , or might even break . Again , IE versions prior to 6 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sites audience uses IE5/5.5 in large numbers , it shouldnt cause problems or discouragement . <p> I like your idea of allowing IE6 users ( for instance ) an easy way to turn off styles , so if something does n't  quite work they can at least get rid of it . However , I still believe that as developers , we will be in a unique position to influence the browser market when IE7 ships perhaps we wont be able to get everyone running Firefox , but in most cases , IE7 will be a huge improvement over what we have to deal with today . <p> I 'm happy to say that Firefox has increased its share at 154,943 = 7.84% . We have more Safari visitors at 2% of visitors than IE 5. x at 0.82% , but is it worth turning away 16,000 plus potential customers ? <p> &lt;sarcasm&gt; I suppose that we could use conditional comments for IE 5. x browsers that would display a " Please upgrade " or " Site best viewed with browser x " message . &lt;/sarcasm&gt; <p> Ugh ! Who are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not support a specific version of a browser ? <p> To John F : Microsoft first said that they were not going to release any upgrade from IE6 to IE7 before Vista was released That they were going to release them together . <p> Since Vista is taking forever to be released , I guess they finally gave up and probably Firefox built more pressure by announcing their 2.0 version . <p> So , seems to be that they are going to release IE7 first , and some time in 2007 maybe 2008 they will release Vista that probably gives them some time to patch the first security holes once it gets released . So Vista will sport an IE7.2 or something . <p> I also disagree with the statement , " the case for testing in IE5.x will be unjustifiably hard to make in most cases . " <p> Having done work in the voluntary sector , I noticed many of our clients there were charities using earlier versions of windows ( with refurbished equipment that does n't  support XP ) . The majority of employees were still using @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have no way to upgrade to the latest version . ( I am under the impression IE7 will only be available as an upgrade to XP SP2 users ? ) <p> It was n't even an option to drop support for these browsers , as like any client they wanted the design they signed off on to work perfectly in the browser of their choice . So will web developers keep locking out these types of visitor to sites they create in the future ? I think it probably comes down to the question of target audience and/or the content that will be featured on the site . <p> To be honest I 've found that it really does n't  take that much longer to produce a site for IE5.x if your already taking IE6 into account as well <p> On one of my sites targeted at non-techies , IE6 on WinXP is just over 50% of visitors , but on pre-XP it adds up to about 9% , roughly the same as Firefox . <p> Considering all of those IE6 users are n't  going to upgrade to IE7 for various reasons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bootleg , or they do n't  have automatic updates turned on ) then I still think there will be enough IE6 users around to have to take them in to account . I 'd bet IE6ll stay larger than Firefoxs market share for at least six months , and a heck of a lot larger than Safari . <p> Unfortunately for me , I ca n't check IE7 at the moment as I 'm on Win2000 . Looks like I 'll have to get an upgrade , just so I can check a browser . Joy . <p> The problem is that there are many computer users out there who have no clue about updates etc . These are the casual users and therefore I am not putting too much hope on IE 6 getting outdated so fast . <p> Yet , I think we should atleast appreciate what Microsoft is doing here . The intention is there , but the actual result we have to wait and see . <p> But what do we do when IE6 still represents the bulk of what our users are using , and we need to keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it give way to IE7 , and do n't  have a spare/second system to have both running ? Surely there 's a large number of developers in this boat who simply cant replace IE6 with IE7 and move on ? I know at least one ( puts hand up ) . <p> Kev : We technically cant , and yes surely most ca n't run IE6 and IE7 . Other than the fact that IE6 does n't  have that great of CSS2 support , I am sure that we wo n't really need to worry all that much . As long as you have experience with IE6 and you know how to avoid problems ( at least most of them ) with the browser then the IE6 users should be fine . <p> It would be interesting to guesstimate the collective amount of profit lost in production time , hacking and reworking the CSS on thousands upon thousands of sites because of all the browser problems and inconsistencies . <p> Me , I run a business , I need to eat . I have n't got hours to go back and rework sites I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of folks here do n't  mind the idea of putting in a lot of free hours . <p> Then Greg , you are probably not running your business as effectively as you can . The fact that your clients site does not work correctly in ie7 is not your issue , it is the clients issue . If they would like their site to be compliant with ie7 then they should have to pay for the updates necessary to make it that way , just like any other maintenance update . It only means new billable business . <p> That is such great news about IE7 , should speed the transition significantly . <p> But , did I read somewhere that IE7 will only run on XPSP2 ? If so , thatll leave a lot of people out of the upgrade loop , as I 've been surprised how many windows pcs I come across that do not have SP2 installed ! <p> - If they would like their site to be compliant with ie7 then they should have to pay for the updates necessary to make it that way , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new billable business . - <p> Jive , if only it were this simple . Clients will not view this as their problem . They will view it as me coming back to nickel and dime them about a technical issue that they do n't  understand . My clients will not be happy about this , and if you 've been in business for any length of time you will understand that unhappy clients mean less referral work , and more time needed on sales work to make up that loss of referrals . <p> Sure , I could probably get most of my clients to pay the IE7 fee , but they 're not going to be happy about it . And that 's probably a higher long term cost than just eating the IE7 work . <p> Dave should get a copy of IE7 RC1 , as beta 1 was completely worthless in terms of site testing , in that it was n't even close to being representative of the level of CSS support that the future shipping IE7 offers . <p> About IE5 ; you do n't  have to " drop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away . Simply deliver it unstyled , by using conditional comments . Remember , delivering a standards-compliant website unstyled means it is perfectly usable , just not as pretty . Andy Clarke and others made the point " why should websites look the same in all browsers ? " Isnt it reasonable for a website to look prettier if viewed with more advanced software ? <p> The point is that putting in a lot of effort to support obsolete software is a distraction , and designing down to the lowest common denominator is selling yourself short . <p> So " to hell with IE5 and IE/Mac " . Do n't  worry . You 're not making anything inaccessible to anyone . <p> Accesskeys and IE7 : I notice that CSSZenGardens use of accesskey attributes means that I lose keyboard access to basic menu functionality in my IE7 RC1 . <p> I have reported this to MS as a critical " bug " , or more correctly a design defect . <p> The madness of accesskeys issue has been covered in a persuasive earlier article . It might be a pain to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strip out all these discredited attributes soon as a service to all of us keyboard users . <p> Browser manufacturers should take accesskeys far less literally , there 's nothing stopping them from ignoring the idea of literal single keystrokes completely and using them to build an " accesskey list menu " or other UI object . 30455 @qwx890455 30451 @qwx890451 <p> You are reading " Priority " , an entry posted on 27 July , 2006 , to the Madrid Airport collection .

Once upon a time I wrote a lot about technology and coding ; these days I 'm not so much interested in the technology as what you do with it . <p> I create . Im happiest when designing , building , or creating something that did n't  previously exist . This has taken many forms over the years . <p> I am primarily a designer .

@@99593413 @3793413/ <p> A bit late posting this due to travel , but I had a chance to sit down with Markus Mielke of the IE team and find out what precisely we can expect of rendering updates in IE7 . Its likely that any praise of Internet Explorer will still be controversial for now , but its well-earned . Hear me out . <p> The latest beta preview release of IE7 , the one that came out in association with this conference , is expected to be more or less the final revision to the rendering engine . What exists now is as feature-complete as it will get , so expect no more CSS or major bug fixes past this point for IE7 . <p> They 're not 100% there yet , there 's still a lot of work to be done , but there are two important take-aways here . First , IE7 is not the end of the road . This is the first big step , but they expect to make many more . Second , now is the time to start fixing your sites . Grab the latest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breaks in it ( as this one does ) , you can expect that will remain true after IE7 final is released . Its time to start the surgery . Itll hurt . But hopefully , the rest of this post will convince you and me both that it wont be so bad . <p> In the Explorer Exposed section on Position is Everything , there 's a big list of bugs exclusive to IE running down the left hand side of the page . With one exception , consider that entire list fixed . The exception is the escaping floats bug , which apparently will take a major code re-architecturing that they simply couldnt do in IE7 ; itll come in a later release . <p> The big sexy stuff is of course , transparent PNGs , : hover on any element , and fixed positioning . Theyve even gone so far as to create a code demo of these in action , which is actually a Zen Garden design . Seriously . If you were in Markus Wednesday morning session you probably saw it . But I 'm not sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since ( chuckle ) it would have to be made to work in IE6 . <p> What else ? Theyve started implementing CSS3 selectors . How about pixel-unit text scaling ? Problem solved ! Font sizing is deprecated , wait until you see the new full-page zoom . Its like zooming in on a PDF . Your absolutely positioned text will no longer scale out of its block , since the block scales equally as well . Its a designers dream . I 'm a bit concerned about how the user will view this change , but that remains to be seen . <p> I still harbour just as much i 'll will toward IE6 as ever , like many of you . And I 'm pretty sure a lot of the IE team understands that sentiment . So while being excited about IE7 might seem contradictory to my past stance on the browser , its because I simply see the potential . This first step is a big one . Its not enough yet , but its significant enough that I know the next step afterward is going to be exactly what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As I said to Markus , at one point in time they had the best browser on the market ; given the sheer momentum I uncovered at this conference , I could very well see it happening again . IE8 : the new Firefox ? Hmm . <p> They need a miracle , when promoting IE8 to makeup for their lack of innovation the past years . <p> I have a hard time picturering myself switching back to IE. Maybe because firefox is/was around ( and my favorite choice ) when i disovered RSS , blogging and social bookmarking . More important Firefox supported these things , and therefor i thing ill always associate them with Firefox . <p> Its quite odd , but I never thought that any version of IE might contain features that would make me switch back . The thought never even crossed my mind - all Ive been wanting for IE is to get itself fixed and up to rendering pages so I 'd not have to bother fixing my websites for a broken browser . <p> Now that the thought has occured , I still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Firefoxs numerous extensions , its cross-platform nature , and flexibility are the reasons I use it . I find it unlikely that IE will ever have superior abilities in those areas . <p> I 'm still not convince this is the time to take the knife and start re-cutting code for IE7 . Especially when the user base is still so heavily IE6 or earlier . Obviously , I 'm talking about commercial sites in this regard . Personal sites can be recode as Firefox ranks much high on my site stats . <p> Well , I 'm praying to the great spaghetti monster in the sky that now that they are " layout-complete " ( which I am happy enough with , compared to IE6 ) they will now be fixing the scripting side of things . Every time I fire up the thing I find scripts that have always worked fine before triggering the oh so helpful " Error on page . " warning . Are you using addLoadEvent by Simon Wilson , for example ? Trouble . ( I have a test page set up if anyone is interested - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , do you know whether we should be worrying about this - or is there any indication that this is still being worked on ? <p> Dave , I am happy to see the last line of this post , as it was what I was thinking . I have IE6 with every thread of my professional body , but I see leaps and bounds of improvements in this release already ( the RSS support blows my mind ) , and I can really see that Microsoft is willing to invest in its browser again . If only browser plugins and security was as good as Firefox , I might be set to switch over ( it does run much faster with less memory , after all ) . <p> I am glad someone else sees that they are turning around too , not just more of the same . <p> &gt; They 've even gone so far as to create a code demo of these in action , which is actually a Zen Garden design . Seriously . I 'm not sure if it 'll make it to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it would have to be made to work in IE6 . <p> Go on - make a special exception and put it online anyway ! <p> I broadly agree with Daves sensible analysis here . There is ample indication across many postings and comments on the IEblog that the IE team are doing their best to clear as much of the legacy bugs out of the way before they can start on the real new implementation . <p> Daves point that : <p> &gt; the escaping floats bug , which apparently will take a major code re-architecturing that they simply could n't do in IE7 ; it 'll come in a later release . <p> suggests that the engine itself has gone through a fair amount of refactoring , but that much more is needed . Given the mess that IE6 was in , as demonstrated by the list in PiE of extremely bizarre and wierd bug side-effects , it must have taken an *awful* amount of work to get to IE7.0s clearly much more stable CSS implementation . <p> It will be interesting to see whether IE7.5 or 8 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cause layout regressions on what has now been fixed . Hopefully not . But it does sound as if major progress on de-tangling Trident has been made . <p> Dave - are there indications yet as to how agressively MS will be pushing IE7 out ? Obviously through Windows/MS Update would be ideal in order to make it a pretty much forced upgrade , but I can understand that many companies who rely on the security configuration of IE6 might find that hard going and will want to delay its rollout . <p> Ah , the Zen Garden design you mention has just been screenshot-ed on the IEBlog . Go on , *please* make it live , even if it looks rubbish in IE6 - perhaps that would be a good indication of how things have progressed ! <p> I see IE7 as a vast improvement over IE 6 and will make developing for IE much easier , but its still lacking . I would LOVE to see support for display:table , display:table-cell , and display:table-row . Support for gencon would be greatly appreciated as well . <p> IEs been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changed in 5 years in what other browsers support . IE has a TON of bugs to fix and a lot of things to support , but for myself to support IE on my website I need at least display:table , display:table-cell , and gencon to have it look perfect on IE7 in its current state , but gencon is n't absolutely necessary . There 's some other minor bugs on my site in IE7 , one having to do with combinations of images , borders , and anchors that 's existed since IE5 . Ill probably work on code on the side to see if I can get it to work in IE7 in its current state if they 're not going to support that stuff in this version pity . <p> As for other websites Ive programmed IE7s made things much easier for me . <p> If the current state of IE7 reflects what were going to get at release than I 'm deeply disappointed . Not because of the features that are not there ( but considering this is the year 2006 should be there ) , but because of the bugs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new bugs that have been introduced that will require developers like myself to find new hacks and workarounds ( to whom can I sent the bill ? ) <p> I 'm still working on a suite of testcases that illustrate bugs in IE7 ( some major ) , but from what I read here it would n't matter anyway . Even though I think that MS should be aware of these bugs if they would have tested themselves against the specs - most of them are quite straigh-forward <p> I do n't  care what they fix , I do n't  care how much they add to try and catch up with present day technology . Microsoft make inferior products and its about time that we all started boycotting them and refusing to design around their idiotic software . <p> Thanks , Dave , for a mature stance . I appreciate your professionalism . Its hard to admit when the bad guy does something right , but I agree . In using IE7 now for a couple of months I found myself on someone elses computer this week ( IE6 ) and was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The new IE7 , despite its remaining faults is still a dream over the older version . I applaud Microsoft for picking up their heels and doing something . Now , off to testing ! <p> Most of the points have already been argued so I 'll be a little out of the topic . <p> Now that IE fully support PNG there is still one major trouble to switch to a non-GIF world the color profile ! Browser like Firefox follows that profile and correct the PNG colors making it impossible to match a background or a JPG . <p> For those who does n't  already encounter this try putting a plain color PNG file over a background of the same color : the colors wo n't match . <p> " I guess the Webkit team is aware of this because Safari seams not to use the color profile at all " <p> I cant support MSIE if they ca n't support Macs . They may have a good product on their hands this time around , but to have it running on only one platform seems awfully cruel to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time now . I 'm thankful to Mozilla and Opera ( the two big ones ) for providing their offerings on multiple systems . <p> Now , if a browser does gamma correction on a proper PNG , every thing will be fine ( since " all " browsers do gamma correction on css colours and such ) , but since some browsers do n't  do gamma correction on PNG images ( looking at you Safari/WebKit ) , and ( arguably ) the most popular image editing software suite cant output PNG images correctly , and it gets annoying . <p> At least you can partly fix it , SuperPNG ( http : **29;210;TOOLONG ) is a plugin for Photoshop that saves images faster , smaller , and with correct gamma . <p> There 's something that I have n't been able to understand for a long while now . Why is it that Firefox , an open-source project is able to produce correct browser rendering ( for the most part ) and IE is n't ? <p> MS has all the money in the world Opera , and Mozilla do not . Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confused about this . <p> @parker : &gt; I cant support MSIE if they ca n't support Macs . They may have a good product on their hands this time around , but to have it running on only one platform seems awfully cruel to me . I think I 'll be a Firefox user for some time now . I 'm thankful to Mozilla and Opera ( the two big ones ) for providing their offerings on multiple systems . <p> Do you use Safari ( a partly open-source product as it happens ) ? Surely the same arguments apply to that . I wish Windows users had some of the stuff that Safari has . <p> Its a shame that creative professionals working on the web have to use IE to test sites , given that most creative professionals work on Macs . I think a good point is raised by saying that Firefox is an open source product and that Microsoft have all the money in the world . <p> Daves point that : <p> &gt; the escaping floats bug , which apparently will take a major code re-architecturing that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come in a later release . <p> To me and many others I know , this simply suggests that they made it so badly in the first place that to fix it would require re-making it from scratch . The fact that they havnt suggests that Microsoft is so greedy and lazy that theyve forced out yet another piece of crap so they can make more money . <p> I would be interested to hear if anyone knows the legalities of an actual boycott of IE , in the sense of making sites unavailable to anyone viewing with any IE browser . <p> cool down your sentiments towards Microsoft . You know just like they do that your target audience runs IE. At least 80% of your users on the Internet are using IE to view your pages . Whether you like it or not you will be making your sites to work with it . And instead of jumping up and down about the forthcoming IE7 get yourself a good reference for its features and start coding . <p> I have n't seen any significant improvement or degradation in IE7 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do fully agree with you , Dave , that their efforts should be commended and think that people should stop whinging about how its still non-standards-compliant . <p> We cant expect such things to happen over night . Considering its only been just over a year since IE7 was announced and that browsers like Firefox , Opera and all the rest have been under continual development during the past *5* years while IE6 was stagnant , yet none of them are fully compliant , you cant honestly expect IE7 to be perfect . <p> Its time to be thankful for what we 've got and look forward to the future with IE8 and beyond . <p> Yes , we all need to get recoding our sites . That 's the main news as far as Im concerned . But considering the time Microsoft has had to do something about IEs poor CSS support , I do n't  see the need for applause . To me , there 's simply no excuse for not having IE virtually up to par with Firefox/Mozilla and Safari by now when it comes to CSS support . One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the continued lack of support for : before , : after , and generated-content . The extra work we all had to do to make sites work with IE6 will now be compunded by more extra work necessary to accomodate IE7 . Plus the hassle of testing on a separate machine ( I know about the standalone script no thanks , we still need to continually test for IE6 on our existing Wintel box ) . So when is Microsoft actually going to do something that actually saves us time and makes our work easier , instead of the reverse ? <p> Why not ? Seriously . I 'm glad about the improvements in IE7 but I do n't  see why it can not be made to be fully web standards compliant . We do n't  even have IE7 yet and we are forgiving its shortcomings . I say postpone its release and get that stuff sorted ! <p> Until IE7 get widely accepted by users , here 's a simple css hack that ensures it that both IE5+ and other browsers ( with native png transparency support ) display transparent png @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without lengthy javascript trickery ) : LONG ... <p> So is the min-height and min-width issues going to be fixed as well ? I heard previously that they werent , but according to what you were saying in your article they will be . I cant tell you ( and many other developers I 'm sure ) how happy I am about that if that 's the case . Thanks for the article ! <p> Although IE7 is certainly an improvement over IE6 as far as CSS support goes , when you compare it to Firefox and Opera , you see just how far behind they still are . I 've tested the overall standards support in HTML/XHTML , CSS 2.1 and CSS 3 , DOM , and ECMAScript and have the results for IE6 , IE7 , Firefox 1.5 , and Opera 8.5 available here : <p> I 'm glad that they finally have their minds set on supporting standards , but there is so much catch-up work that still needs to be done , and I do n't  think they have a chance at reaching Firefoxs and Operas level for at least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sean and Paul , it is obvious that they are n't  commercial software developers . <p> First of all , let me point out that there 's no good reason to hold off on shipping IE7 until the standards compliance is complete . Commercial software development is an iterative process . Whether you ship the product in once or twice before you make the final goal generally does n't  make a lot of difference on how long it eventually takes to make the final goal . The advantage of shipping interum releases is that you get validation from your market place that your intended goal is what is needed . <p> Why not allow users to get their hands on some of the juicy new features and the enormous improvements that theyve made thus far ? <p> BTW , Dave , have you installed the latest IE7 image ?

Usually just simple things like saying no to a plastic bag when possible and just carrying things home with me , or choosing produce that 's travelled a few less miles to get to my fridge . Nothing terribly significant on a one-person scale , but stuff that makes a bit of difference if a lot of people are doing it . <p> Of course I 'm aware that there 's waste occurring behind the scenes in the retail channel . Goods need to be manufactured , byproducts need to be disposed of , items need fuel and containers for shipping , etc . Okay , that 's a given . But when stores order in bulk its an opportunity to cut down on some of that , whether that means making less trips , using less boxes , or otherwise . <p> Today really threw that into sharp relief . A couple of weeks back Apple came out with a new keyboard , and due to the local Mac retailers not receiving their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

Its the next level of the shipping container and padding that really makes my brain hurt . I 'm chalking it up to standard-sized shipping boxes , and this was simply the one that happened to have enough room to house the factory box . But youd think the factory box ought to be good enough for the sake of shipping , no ? Looks like I have yet another reason to avoid ordering tangible objects off the web . <p> In my experience , people seem to prefer pristine product boxes to non-pristine ones . Were all taught not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often than not , we learn if there 's smoke there 's a fire . So I guess people instinctively associate the condition of the box with the condition of the contents . So I can understand the whole notion of wanting to protect the product box ( even though I do n't  necessarily think its worth the resources wasted on it ) . <p> It gets far worse than that . My new mobile phone came in a nice shrink wrapped product box with good padding inside to protect the contents . And thank god , the online retailer had more sense than to stick it inside another box . <p> But when you open the package , you see the phone charger inside its own little box . So are the manuals and the accompanying CD-ROM . Now why in the world do you want to further protect the charger and manuals which are already inside a well padded shrink wrapped box ? Does someone really think the phone might go crazy of claustrophobia and start eating at the charger/manuals ? <p> Perhaps these are artifact of a rather insensitive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ separately , put in individual boxes and sent to a different location to be put together inside the product package ? <p> Either way , yes , it is rather insane that boxes need to be protected by other boxes . <p> I have it on good authority that those seven layers of packaging are all in the interest of protecting the extremely delicate and **28;241;TOOLONG Apple key .

I cant imagine Apple taking a step backward environmentally without some good reason . <p> I was befuddled by the same thing when I ordered my keyboard . I thought maybe it was a one-off thing , like they ran out of regular boxes at the shipping center . <p> Ive been a bit conflicted lately about the tradeoff between the convenience of online ordering and the amount of waste that goes into packing individual items up and flying them around in 747s . Sure Im saving a trip in a car to a big box store in the suburbs , but its kind of depressing when that one audio adapter arrives packed in a box five times its size filled with packing material . <p> Seems like there 's some room for one of the big online retailers to innovate in a super-lightweight , space efficient , flexible-for-all-sizes packaging system . <p> What the packing materials are made from is a huge factor though too . Reduce is good ; reuse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how much recyclable stuff gets thrown away by ignorant or lazy people " eg aluminum cans , receipts , etc. " even though the recycle bin is 2 feet away . I 'm not sure what 's worse " being lazy or being ignorant/oblivious . I 'm sure some of you all have seen these people Reduce means nothing if everyone does n't  recycle the stuff they already get . <p> Apples improved their packaging thus far at least using cardboard instead of stryrofoam but yet there are some people who probably end up throwing that stuff away instead of sorting it into their recyclables , along with their paper . <p> As for Wilsons comment above , depending on how far away you drive to the store , I 'd actually give the nod to online shopping . I can tell you one thing : FedEx and UPS do not use consumer 747s for transporting materials " the versions they use are for transporting goods . And lots of them . Ditto that for trucks . And who says your shipment is by Jet I use ground shipping all the time . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , those big trucks can save 5 due to the economies of scale . ( Think carpooling except for packages . ) <p> I 'd rather have to reuse / recycle some cardboard than get a broken product that I 'd have to ship back , then get the item resent ( still risking breakage ) . I never hurts to have a couple extra cardboard boxes around . Once a DHL shipped car stereo component my ex-boss ordered looked as though it had been dropped in an ankle deep puddle , then tossed around a bit . Any extra space between a shippers hands and my product is a plus . That said , I still like buying from a local store . There 's nothing better than walking out of a store with a physical object after you just traded currency . The time between the online-payment and the physical object makes the giddiness of the purchase wane . <p> My MacPro came in a very tight setup . Good protection not a lot of spare room . I was also impressed with Adobes CS3 suite . Small and very cost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the switchable branding . The outer box was very well designed . <p> Is the new keyboard good ? I tried it briefly in a store here in Denmark but you cant buy them loose yet as they only come with the new iMac . I cant wait to hopefully replace the old white plastic trash keyboard . <p> So far so good . I 've had a MacBook for over a year so Ive adjusted to the lower profile key style , plus the smaller angle is going to be a nice break on my fingers . Still have to look down a bit more than usual , but that should go away soon . <p> I recently ordered a body pillow from Amazon . It arrived in a huge box , of which half the space was taken up by , get this , Amazons airbags for padding . It was amusing in a very sad way . <p> As for your keyboard box , if you were giving it as a gift would you really feel comfortable giving a beat up box ? Maybe companies could offer an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ packing option for orders that are n't  gifts . <p> From what I heard , some postal workers like to play with the boxes they get , throwing them around and such . And if that 's even remotely true , I sure am glad to get as many protection boxes as possible . <p> Also , as some people noted , the boxes are made of cardboard , which is recyclable . I have an exam on this tomorrow , so did you know 93% of packaging paper/cardboard is made from recycled paper ? So as long as you 're aware enough to throw this cardboard into a recycling bin , not much damage has been made to the woods . And another thing .. Paper industry claims being only good for the woods , since they clean up the dead trees and branches , rather than chopping the growing ones . This way they make space for new , fresh trees . I 'm not quite sure this is really so , but it is a view from a different perspective . <p> This irritates the heck out of me too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ VW parts supplier I use . The parts need to be protected , and they are often strangely shaped , so if I order a few items , I often get a big box with a lot of packing . However , they do n't  use polystyrene - inside the big box are my items nestled in cardboard box material that has been part shredded . They have a machine that shreds the cardboard but not into strips - the sheet remains in one piece but has a series of cuts , making it appear like wicker/weaved . It provides padding but is good re-use of materials and can itself be recycled again . <p> I once ordered a piece of software . I was very surprises , when the mail man handed me a box which seemed capable of holding at least five copies of the latest Harry Potter book , and almost did n't  weight anything . I opened up the box to find the CD-ROM just underneath the cardboard - it was n't even in a jewel case just in one of those paper sleeves . The rest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I agree that the amount of over packaging seems like a bit of overkill ( loved the comment about the Amazon pillow ! ) but having a little more protection for the product is usually not a bad thing . <p> Back in the dark ages , ( early 90s , way before the Apple Store ) I worked for a distribution company that warehoused Apple products to ship to Apple resellers . We constantly received returns of product from our customers stating that they could n't sell it to their customers because the boxes were scuffed . Not ripped , dinged or damaged , just scuffed . So naturally , the overbox became a neccessity . Fast forward to the 2000s and now Apple is producing beautiful packaging that makes the overbox an absolute must . Then the distributor throws that in a common size overbox of their own . Its stupid , but its cheaper for everyone involved that your keyboard arrive without damage . And if a few trees have to die in the process , so be it . Their attitude , not mineI could live without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " No , no , no ! You got it all wrong here ! Apple 's handing you a nice big container , allowing you to collect all your paper waste and deliver it to a recycling center in one recyclable box ! " <p> If it were intentional , the box would be $40 , black , and labelled iRecycle . Duh . ; ) <p> Has anyone tried the new apple keyboard with a PC yet ? I 'm curious to know if its still a solid product , since my Logitech DiNovo w/laser mouse has given me nothing but grief since I bought it last year . <p> By far the worst packing evil are those damn polystyrene peanuts everyone seems to use nowadays . HUGE boxes with tiny items are stuffed full of these little devils that seem to stick to everything except the trash can . <p> My wife and I have started using the paper from our document shredder to pack things , after mixing it up a bit for security . With so much junk mail our household generates at least 1 whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makes for a limitless supply of packing material . <p> : - ) In Japan in every descent shop you always get at least 4 layers wrap on every item you buy ( not food of course ) . It is some kind of custom to wrap everything nicely several times before you give it to someone <p> After being in PEI for a week , Dave , I could n't believe their stance on waste management . Beside every garbage can , even the ones in the middle of no where ( on bike trails and such ) , there was also a compost and recycling bin . I live in Toronto , so to see this kind of initiative really makes me happy . <p> In fact , a little bit of the Islander attitude from out there has rubbed off on me . <p> When already have a bag when I go into a shop I try to stop them giving me yet another bag , but sometimes they 're just to damn quick and they force their own bag on you . Quite annoying . Too often I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ item , all which easily would fit into one . <p> Yeah - Jeff got that same keyboard and box . I was mad enough to write apple , who immediately wrote me back and said they were taking it up with their distribution co , who were the guilty party . So a sortofa passing of the buck . <p> I 've had a similar experience ordering just a keyboard iSkin from the online Apple store Came in a box more than 4x its size , and its definitely something that does n't  need a whole lot of protecting ( its made of .. what , rubber ? ) <p> I found a company called KB Covers that has tons of Apple Keyboard Covers.I got a Photoshop one and I love it . It came in an envelope with minimal wasteI wonder why Apple does n't  carry them ? I like them a lot better than iSkin . <p> That is a poor showing . In contrast we ordered 5 of the new keyboards and a few other Apple things . It all arrived in one shipping box , tightly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ box and a bit of plastic over the keys . <p> One thing I kind of discovered after starting my job of the " web master " for a manufacturing company packaging is a pretty serious thing . <p> Trust me , the MFGs would NOT add such unbelievable packaging schemes if it did n't  HAVE to . <p> *Have* to being either a ) they have to pass requirements for packaging , such as the " drop test " where you drop a box from a certain height and it can not smash the inside contents to some degree ( I do n't  know the specifics , I 'm the web guy , not the engineers who have all kinds of funny looking equipment with moving parts hammering and pounding on boxes ) . <p> MFGs , like any company , are trying to maximize profit . There 's a huge investment in packaging on getting is as cheap as possible without allowing any damage to the product itself . I would n't be surprised that its actually cheaper for the company to just toss it in a big box , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) than to try and design a very small , minimal mass box that can protect the product and pass the required tests . <p> Thus , " waist " = " profit " sadly and unintuitive . Which does bring up a real good point . Those who are trying hard to micromanage their lives to be as green as possible are probably better off buying from brick and mortar stores than ordering online . Those online stores already received their bulk orders in protected boxes and end up *re-packaging* a product to send to you . <p> You said it right " conscious about my levels of consumption " is a trend may I add a feel good trend . I bet you spent more resources creating your packaging illustration on your computer and the comments you posted and the comments being posted on your site than it took to make all that packaging ! <p> While I agree the packaging is overkill ; I do n't  follow the carbon footprint thing because its just a silly trend . <p> i 'm sick of over-wrapping with plastic on basically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the main reasons my band is releasing our album digital-only is because of all the plastic that goes into CD packaging . its ridiculous <p> even at the grocery store , its all in 2x the packaging it needs to be in . <p> Reminds me of buying a very expensive WiFi module for a Toshiba laptop . This is a module about half the size of a folded-out matchbook , mind you . When it arrived I was a bit surprised to get a cardboard shipping carton about the size and weight of seven average paperbacks . And why was that ? Because the card shipped with six paperbacks worth of Installation Manual , Warranty , Specifications , Compliance Documentation , and more . Each one a paperback in itself , the card , which weighed in at aboyt 30 grams from memory , arrived weighing over a kilo <p> Well , when items are manufactured on the opposite side of the globe , it takes a little extra packaging to protect it on the trek to the consumer . I especially hate the packaging that 's impossible to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makes me think twice before returning it because Ive done so much damage opening the packaging . <p> Perhaps that 's another part of itcomplicated packaging discourages returns ? <p> This reminds me of a DVD I ordered from amazon some time ago . When it arrived ( at Buenos Aires ) I had to pay an extra fee to the post office due to " overweight " . It was just a single DVD on its case , and I ended up paying half of its value on the package Sometimes it can be like buying a can of beans . The beans are cheaper than the can . <p> This is a great article , we received a cd the other day with images on from a client to enable us to upload their images on to the corporoate web site . It came in a 3ft by 1 ft cardboard box , inside the box was bubble wrap , inside the bubble wrao was a padded envelope , inside the padded ebvelope was a small cardboard box inside the cardboard box was an old music cd jewel and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made us laugh they had used all the packaging but used a second hand jewel to save money <p> I think there is actually a law now where if you believe that a product is excessively packaged , you can actually sue them . <p> I remember after watching some environmental programme , walking around Tescos and thinking exactly what is overpackaged . <p> I looked at Pizzas , which some have boxes around them when frozen - do they really need to be there ? Would it not be better to have a leaflet that the customer picks up with the pizza for reference when cooking ? Also things like Beauty products i have noticed , you get the bottle , and sometimes this comes with outer cardboard packaging on , with perhaps no information on apart from the same as what is on the bottle . These are purely for presentation . How many people could we sue for overpackaging products . By the looks of it Apple could be a winner with the amount of packaging they have . Instead of producing layers upon layers , why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Things have changed a lot since you wrote this article . Its good to see supermarkets ( in the UK ) charging for carrier bags now as they become more aware of the need to cut down on packaging , although many manufacturers still insist on bulky packaging using unsustainable plastics . 30455 @qwx890455 30451 @qwx890451 <p> You are reading " Reduce ?

@@99593416 @3793416/ <p> Applying positioning to a parent element , to allow absolute positioning of a child element within the parent . <p> Context-sensitive elements . Chaining classes by applying two or three or more to the highest parent element possible allows cascading down to deep child elements . <h> Positioning <p> Something I 've only recently wrapped my mind around is that if you position a parent element by using absolute or relative positioning , you can absolutely position any child elements from the edges of the parent . <p> Too abstract ? Try this : apply position : relative to a &lt;div&gt; , without supplying a top or left value . Then apply position : absolute ; to the &lt;p&gt;s inside it , with top and left values . Sort of like this : <p> Whys that useful ? Instead of the &lt;p&gt; elements starting from the top left of the browser window , they start from the top left of the containing #parent . You get the benefits of absolute positioning with none of the mess of fixed elements . Especially useful for fixed-width pages that are centered . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> This one is a bit harder to explain , but the basic mechanism works like this . You can apply a bunch of classes to a single element . The higher up the element is in the document tree , the more each class can control . By applying them to a top-level element like &lt;body&gt; , you give yourself a bunch of different ways to get at the elements contained within . ( Ryan Carver explains it in a bit more detail . ) <p> &lt;body class= " weblog homePage blue " &gt; <p> Using this example code , you can reference deep elements with fairly simple selectors , and customize items based on which page they sit on . For example , let 's say you change the blue class in the above code to red . One simple class change in the body tag , and you can change the colour of your entire site by referencing each child element : <p> . red h1 , . red h2 color : red ; . red #sidebar color : red ; <p> Of course , if you do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . green h1 , . green h2 color : green ; . green #sidebar color : green ; <p> The power starts becoming apparent when you set up a style sheet with a bunch of variations like this , and changing between each is as easy as modifying a class . <p> Similarily , we could hook into the weblog class and style pages that are specifically weblog content differently from those pages with , say , static or permanent classes . And we can combine both colour switching and page-sensitivity on the same site . <p> There are really interesting implications from this , particularly from a code viewpoint . Instead of littering your source with inline scripts , a simple body class switch is all that 's needed . By passing a few variables on to the page ( and you can almost view each of these classes as variables , incidentally ) you have some incredibly flexible control over how the page is rendered . <p> Still exploring this one . More coming in the next few months as various projects launch . 30454 @qwx890454 <p> The cascading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could this allow development of a new type of style-switcher ? You could simply use the DOM to alter those classes . Just food for thought . <p> Jonathon no . By applying three classes to the body element , I can usually remove a ton of classes elsewhere in my code . Because I 'm cascading down I can build bigger selectors like " . blue #header ul a:hover " instead of , say , giving all links in the list their own class . This is a bad example , but until I write the followup article , it wont be immediately clear unless you start using it . <p> That positioning trick is quite useful , and I tend to use it in the situations described ( centered column or unknown coordinates ) . Absolute positioning seems to be a wee bit forgotten these days , though its one of the more powerful features of CSS . <p> The second trick is somewhat new to me , though I have used single classes on the body to style , say , headings and navigation differently in different sections @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure the follow-up will she 'd a little more light on its use . <p> I had no idea you could apply multple classes like that . I can see how the cascade is usefull . <p> I have used this kind of class on the body , to make the active tab ( or whatever nav ) appear different than its brothers . Its easier to do this with systems like MT , than to put a class= " active " on the or of the element . <p> Even better have multiple flags , so to speak , applied the body . <p> Also , multiple classes are usefull when you want to apply two different styles to an element . Say you have a style for . indent and . purple and want to apply them both to a single . In the past , I would have made a new . purpleindent class , but no more . <p> While I 've known about the absolute positioning trick for a while now , the notion of applying multiple classes to a single element is completely new to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ syntax . Sure , I 've always wanted to be able to do something like this , but I 'd never read anywhere that it could be done . <p> Thanks for clearing this up , Dave ! Multiple classes on a single element should certainly make our CSS files much more concise when applied properly . <p> I came up with something conceptually similar to style different themed sections of a website , though I did n't  take it as far as you have . It worked quite well to have the class on the body tag , so I could , then , affect huge changes in the pages by simply doing something like body.sectionname #content attrs . It was one of my better moments . ; ) <p> I await part 2 of the article to see what the great mind of Dave reveals . I 'm sure it will be useful ! : ) <p> Ive been familiar with both of these concepts for a bit , and while Ive not used the multiple classes , I have found the positioning quite useful . Also , if one did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be rather frustrating . Very nice . <p> Interesting positioning trick , but I question the usefulness of the cascading technique . Does n't  sticking so many class identifiers in your tags harken back to the days when content and presentation were one and the same ? Granted , linking everything to a stylesheet does make things more flexible , but its still an awful lot of extra classes ( and CSS ) . <p> I 've used the first happy discovery for some time in building ( horror of horrors ) Windows-like applications complex forms with subsections corralled into their own little labelled boxes within the main application grid . By nesting two divs within a parent div for each such subsection , you can build ( for example ) a gray 3D box with a little blue offset label . Whether or not following the Microsoft look is a good thing is debatable that my users are comfortable with that look is an argument in favor of it , and I 've found that using CSS tricks like this one has been invaluable in putting my Web apps together . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way by CSS Zen Garden , btw . <p> Jeff - Thats odd I never really seem to have problems concerning negative margins Just take a look at my websitethe top right logo is fully negatively positioned ( sounds odd , but you know what I mean ) . <p> I have n't tried to use em as a size in those casesbut what you could do is try to make the margin-top of the div em too , as you have tried to put div position : relative ; inright ? ( or absoluteas long as IE has something to work with . ) <p> If you look at Ryan Carvers weblog at www.fivesevensix.com , you 'll see how he used the multiple classes trick to style www.onetruefit.com for Lee jeans . Is starting to use it on my companies site to apply a style to a sub-division of the site , and then allow common style elements to be used without having to write redundant styles . <p> It seems to me that the only reason to use multiple classes in the body is to allow for the co existence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not just use #body #header ul a:hover instead of . blue #header ul a:hover ? <p> Using the multiple classes does allow for more separation of the style elements so you could change . blue whch could hande color but not change . weblog which could handle typography elements . <p> Using the cascade is a great way to style the actual elements without having to add classes I use it almost exclusively using classes only for instances that IE does n't  support like adjacent sibling selectors , and : first pseudo classes for example . <p> In fact a good way of shoe horning a good CSS positioned section into an olf Table and Font tag ridden page ( I have to do this way to much for work ) is to enclose it all in a ided DIV or ided TD and cascade everything div#styles ul#header li a:hover . This way ULs outside the #styles div wont be touched by your new styles . <p> AkaXakA - Except that browsers interperet magrins , especially negative margins , differently . I 've had times when trying to extend this code @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &lt;h1&gt; some text &lt;/h1&gt; &lt;p&gt; some text &lt;/p&gt; &lt;div&gt; <p> Make a border on the div , then negative margin the h1 to -1em and set its size to 1em . Should place the text right on top of the border of that div , right ? Pft . Sometimes in other browsers ( IE I hate you ) it simply would n't show up - like I had set overflow : none . Even changing overflow around did n't  help either . Be wary wtih negative margins . <p> Weve been doing something similar for awhile where I work . We have different types of " containers " and change the styling of content within those containers using the cascade . I.E. class= " container " or " container panelgroup " or " container menu " , etc . Its been quite helpful in keeping the majority of the code pretty generic and semantic but still getting a great degree of flexibility in styling . <p> I think the " cascading " technique might also be another way to provide the " defining of color constants " that many designers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ define a color once in your css , then have it apply to various different elements . If you later need to all instances of the color to another color , you can do so by modifying just one line of CSS . <p> One advantage to this approach is that you avoid the confusion of multiple definitions of a single class ( eg , one grouped with others for shared properties , and another by itself for idiosyncratic properties ) , which is the present method of doing this . <p> Sure you have to assign the extra classes in the html at first , but by that , what you are actually doing is defining design relationships between elements , which seems to be a good thing . <p> Of course , it only allows single-purpose constants ( you would have to define different constant-classes for background-colors and foreground-colors ) , but still , that also strengthens your element relationships . <p> Most people talk about CSS " constants " ( or " variables " they use the word interchangably ) with reference to colors , but it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , did I make sense , or should I provide an example ? I have n't really tried it yet , so for complex sites it might be more inefficient than the prevailing approach . <p> Joseph - bingo ! That 's exactly what I used it for on one recent job . The colour sheme is controlled by one style sheet that dumps all fore- and background colour information into a quick series of rules . ( You need a few more than you 'd think actually , due to varying colour combinations ) Adding a new colour scheme is all of 5 minutes work , most of it in coming up with a pleasing scheme in the first place . <p> I did n't  actually end up making full use of the cascading trick described above , though I could have . For an example , let 's say you have an information section and a working section . The first is just static content , the second actually expects interaction from the user . You want to style each a bit different , so the information section is blue , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the style sheet this way , the only thing needed to trigger the color change is a body class : <p> &lt;body class= " information " &gt; &lt;body class= " working " &gt; <p> Simplified , but when you extend it to a whole whack of rules at once , its incredible how easy it is to shift the whole look through one selector . Doubly so if you 're controlling the layout the same way . <p> Ive been using the positioning trick for a while as well and it fits my way of thinking completely . I am sure I am not the only one who highly dislikes any constraints you 're putting yourself up with when designing a layout . Relative positioning is , for me , the most comfortable way of doing so . <p> I would n't want to call this a trick though , I recall reading this in the specifications . Or maybe not : ) <p> What 's interesting is that the example on the spec you mention *does* actually validate validate through textarea , but that 's because the validator reverses the order of the bold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ code should be valid because " A double bar ( ) separates two or more options : one or more of them must occur , in any order . " ! LONG ... And more ! .. the style you actually wrote was 20px , not 14 ! lol Anyway , many thanks for your kind replies , I 'm sure you 'll agree I 've bugged you enough . <p> Forgive me if this has been suggested I do n't  have time at the moment to read every comment . <p> That being said , I 've used the multiple class trick with Movable Type to create a different style for each blog category . FOr exampl , say I want a different background image per category . Maybe I want a guitar image when I 'm talking about music , and some cards when i 'm talking about poker . You can set up your MT templates to apply the category name as a class , so that you get something like : <p> div class= " blogEntryBody music " <p> and <p> div class= " blogEntryBody poker " <p> That way , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , colors , width , height , etc. ) to DIV.blogEntryBody and those special styles ( such as background image ) to DIV.poker and DIV.music.

@@99593418 @3793418/ <p> Over the past three months Ive gotten myself used to checking all my projects into a pair of Subversion repositories , one for personal projects and another for all my client work . In both cases I 'm the only person using them , so neither are your typical SVN use case scenarios , but I 'm still finding my system enormously handy for a few reasons : <p> I work off two computers during any given week , and though I 've been good about keeping them synchronized , I have had the occasional few hours of work wiped out by a wrong-direction file transfer . Plus the mental overhead of manually keeping track of which files have changed meant I did n't  do it as often as I should . <p> I have at least three copies of my work on hand , which means I 'm well situated if any one or two copies crap out on me , or get stolen , or whatever . <p> I can revert to a previous version of my work if I ever realize down the road I needed something from a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mostly theoretical for now , as I have n't had to do it yet , but its nice to know the option is there . <p> But here 's the twist : my repositories exist on USB keys . I decided against storing them on a server , so I needed some other way to create relatively portable repositories . USB drives fit that bill . Now there are two immediate flaws with this setup : <p> Security <p> A USB key is a physical object that could wind up in someone elses possession , through theft or carelessness or any other reason . I do n't  want anyone else having access to work in progress or my personal files . <p> Data Loss <p> Also through losing the key , or through physical damage , my work could disappear . <p> The second point is relatively easy to shrug off : I have the master files in three locations , its just one of those that I 'd be losing . Okay , so I 'd also lose the change history , but in my mind the most important piece is the current @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ backed up in two other places . So , while being forced to recreate the repository would n't be ideal , it also would n't be a huge hardship . <p> However its that first point that concerned me more . I had to get a little more proactive about securing the USB key , but luckily OS X makes that fairly simple to accomplish . Using the built-in Disk Utility ( Applications &gt; Utilities &gt; Disk Utility ) its easy to create an encrypted disk image that protects its contents from prying eyes : <p> Select a size that will fit on your key . For an 8GB USB key I went with a 7.5GB disk image to account for byte count differences , though I probably could have gone a bit higher . <p> Set encryption to AES-128 . <p> Leave format as " read/write " , then hit Create . Enter your password when prompted , and verify it . Do not lose or forget this password . <p> Wait ; it will take quite a while to write a large disk image over USB . <p> What you 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but this ones encrypted. 128 bit AES is n't uncrackable , but if its secure enough for classified government documents , its good enough to render the disk image useless to virtually anyone who does n't  have your password . <p> Now to use this image you first need to manually mount it by inserting the key , then double-clicking on the image that sits on the key . You 'll know its mounted when you see two drive icons in your Macs device listing , one for the physical USB key and one for the virtual disk image . <p> Once the encrypted image is mounted you can read and write files inside of it like you would any other disk , so this is where the repository goes . I took the easy way out and just grabbed the latest beta of Versions and used it to set up my initial repository by pointing it at a master copy of my project folder on one computer , and then checking out the repository on the other computer . <p> And from then on its SVN as usual ; my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I can make changes on either end with the confidence that I 'm not going to lose critical data . And this have been an extremely useful system for me , as evidenced by the fact I 'm still using it religiously three months later . But there are a few minor quibbles I should point out . <p> I do have to keep swapping the USB key back and forth between machines ( hence the term Sneakernet in the title of this post ) . I also need to hit eject twice every time I want to remove the USB key : once for the disk image and once for the USB key itself . I would n't have to do this if I hosted the repository on a server somewhere . <p> I also need to remember to keep the key with me when Im likely to require it ; having it on my keychain was working fine for that up until the metal clasp broke . But I 'm also finding the process of checking in my work is making me more aware of when one computer or the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the MacBook to go work in a cafe or elsewhere I 'll remember that I need the USB key with me . So far so good , but I can at least see the potential for this being a problem now and then . <p> And finally , a USB key is limited in space ; I 've been checking in all my work , from HTML and CSS to PSD and AI files . Some of these are many megabytes in size , and the space requirement for multiple revisions is not insignificant . <p> While I can foresee the need to maintain the repository down the road by trimming the oldest revisions to free up space , I have n't had to cross that bridge yet . And I also half suspect that simply moving the repository to a larger USB key will be the path of least resistance , as larger capacities are introduced and prices come down . <p> Hi Dave , that 's an interesting system . I 'm a little unclear on why you do n't  use a central server . For me , a major benefit of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work on the code on a completely different computer , its accessible ( I just check it out from the server ) . <p> If I were you , I 'd be deathly worried I 'd lose the key ! That 's all your backups . <p> I 've recently started checking stuff into an SVN repository too ! I have n't been at it as long as you have , but I 'm really enjoying it . I ended up putting my repos on the PC that I do n't  use very much since I bought a mac - it was much easier than I thought , ( click my name above and scroll down for a full description ) . <p> One note - I recently had to go back to an older revision , and it is a bit of a pain in the behind . Also , I have been having problems with Versions if I have to do anything out of the ordinary , ( like go back to an older revision ) . <p> In the end , I am enjoying my SVN server . I am now collaborating with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well . <p> @Daryl - I thought it was clear in the post , but I have a backup of the current work in three different places including the key , so I 'm not at all worried about losing it . <p> @Josh - Initially the main reason for not going with a server is because I still intend to get the hell off Dreamhost one day and I only want to set up a remote repository once . Then when I thought about the times I do n't  have wifi USB started making sense , and now that I have it all in AES-128 I 'm thinking I 'm more secure this way anyway . <p> @Andrew - Ones 8GB , ones 4GB . I archived a bunch of non-active work before the first check-in , so at the moment it all fits comfortably . <p> Cool idea Ive been looking into setting up an SVN repo for my work as well but the logistics have been holding me back ; your way would definitely solve some of the problems I 've been thinking about . I 'm planning on setting up a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a live server less of a chore still an interesting alternative though . <p> I 've also been hearing a lot about Git these days and how it treats even your local copy as a repository , with version history etc . That would be another potential solution , but as far as I can tell , there 's not much Windows or Mac support for that version control system . <p> Very cool . Ive been meaning to start using SVN ( currently I just use my IDE Aptana Studio and my server to upload/download projects ) . I 'm in the same situation ( I 'd be the only one to check anything in or out of the repository ) , but it would still be useful for the same reasons that you mentioned . <p> Using a server instead of USB drive would be easier of course , but I can understand your desire to set up a remote repository only once <p> Seconding the DVCS recommendation . It sounds like the lack of a centralized server would really benefit you in this case where there 's a portable setup and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need to sync from one another without necessarily having the centralized one available . Git can be built on Macs , and there 's a msysgit port available on Windows that 's fairly usable . <p> For a Subversion user , though , I 'd recommend Mercurial . Its roughly equivalent to Git in terms of features ( notable exception : ability to rewrite history as easily ) , but the command set is much closer to SVN and works better on Windows/Macs because its written in Python . Its also , like many ( all ? ) DVCSes , much faster than SVN . <p> Uh oh , you 've mentioned VCS in public Dave , these days that always results in a chorus of " use git ! no , use bzr ! no , use mercurial ! " : ) <p> But none of these DVCS have nice GUI apps like Versions , which sounds like its important to you . <p> That said , anyone using SVN and willing to use a command line should take a look at SVK ( 1 ) . Like the DVCS mentioned it allows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SVK uses the SVN filesystem for its storage format , so you can still use GUI tools to look at your repository , just do n't  use them to work on the repository . <p> With SVK you 'd keep the main SVN repository on one of the machines and use SVK to keep a copy of that repository on your usb key . Youd commit changes to the usb key then at a later point push changes back to the main SVN repo . <p> This way you 'd have a single master repo in a safe place , that can be backed up with all your other stuff ( repositories do get corrupted sometimes ! ) , but are still able to commit changes whilst away from the main machine or a network connection . <p> Because you keep your original SVN repo you 're also in a position to just revert to SVN alone if you decide you do n't  like SVK . <p> ( I know git does a lot of this stuff too , but its commands are quite different from svn , harder to learn I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ key nearby is reduced latency times ; storing files remotely often incurs a serious time overhead when browsing and checking out of the repository . My employers SVN server takes about 15 minutes to pull down a new export of at least one of its projects ( that 's " only " 150M ) . I imagine such a task would take 30 seconds with a direct connection . <p> Interesting alternative . I cant imagine dragging the drive back and forth . <p> I actually have the " server " portion set up on my Mac and then I can check things out locally ( the usual ) or over the network to another machine . I found the hardest part was getting svnserve setup in Leopard . Maybe someday I 'll add in a sync/backup of the repositories to a remote location , but for now my local backup is sufficient . <p> Ive been doing this myself for a while , for all of the same reasons . For my setup I added a linux box to house the repos and then hooked everything together with a Hamachi VPN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the USB key in one of the machines and making it the server . <p> Like you , I just adopted Subversion for all my client work , even though in most cases I 'm the only one accessing it . I 'm using Dreamhost as the Subversion server . Its a bit slow for big commits , but has worked well for me . I also like Cornerstone very much . <p> The one piece of the puzzle that bothers me is that Subversion does n't  support the resource forks of Mac files . Not an issue mostly except for Applescripts which come back into the working copy as 0 byte files . My workaround is to always include a ZIP version of any Applescript that has to be refreshed as the script is updated . The 0 byte file can be deleted and replaced by the version protected inside the ZIP file . <p> Two more issues : When your files grow your stick will not only be to small , it will also become to slow . Data transfer is usual about a fifth of i.e. USB drives . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drives with build in finger print readers ! Encryption is done by the hardware inside of this drives , independent from your OS . <p> Anyway , I prefer to use a https-svn repository on the net ( for reasons already mentioned here ) . <p> Like other commentators , I would strongly recommend a server if you 're using subversion . The centralized repository method just really lends itself to a server . I tried the SVN + USB route and gave up after I lost one drive , then accidentally broke another , then kept forgetting to bring my USB drive with me . You may not be worried about losing your revision history , but its still a pain to create a new repository from the working copy . <p> If you 're using a USB drive I 'd encourage you to consider a distributed system like git or Mercurial . Then , your entire repository ( history and all ) will be in three places . And git makes it really , really , really easy to create new branches to try out ideas . <p> Why do n't  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ projects with multiple contributors , and for some other more robust features , but DropBox has a lot of the bases covered ( including version control ) . <p> I work on 3 different computers , all linked up via my 50gb DropBox account . I save active projects directly to my DropBox , in their own respective folders . The files are saved locally to my HDD , so they 're quick to work with . When saved , they are uploaded to the Amazon S3 cloud in the background , and then pushed to the other 2 computers . <p> Everything is seamless . I do n't  have to worry about uploading , or checking files in or out , or taking a USB key with me . Files are simply automatically synced up . It has been a lifesaver , because otherwise working on the same projects on 3 different computers ( both Windows &amp; OS X ) would be a bitch ! <p> a ) History . This is stored in each repository on each machine , so you do n't  lose this if your USB key @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can diff binaries , not just text , so when you save multiple versions of a PSD file , it will only save the actual changes . <p> c ) Offline . Since each copy is itself a repository and your server is n't on a USB key , you could leave your USB key behind when you go to the cafe , commit your changes locally , and push/pull them when you return to your desk . <p> There is a bit of a learning curve , and you would have to replace Versions with GitX ( http : //gitx.frim.nl/ ) , but it does solve a few of the issues you mentioned above . <p> ( P.S. There is a 5px notch out of the right column of your template in Chrome ) 
@@99593419 @3793419/ <p> The last time I wrote about icon design , I explained why its necessary to produce variations of an icon at different sizes . At small sizes in particular its important for icons to respect the pixel grid , enough so that extra work modifying the basic icon outline is usually required . <p> Now I 'm going to walk through the actual process of re-sizing an icon to explain how I handle anti-aliasing tweaks using a vector editor like Illustrator . <p> In order to get an icon to fit nicely within the pixel grid , I 've had to get used to the idea of distorting my basic shapes to influence the way anti-aliasing is rendered . This is particularly noticeable when resizing down to smaller sizes that offer less pixels to play with . Carefully set solid lines of pixels Ive created at larger sizes might end up on a half- or third-pixel line at smaller sizes , and split the difference between two pixels instead of one . Adjusting to correct that requires moving the lines around , which quickly distorts the outlines for the sake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is an icon for Groups I created at 32+32 , then scaled down to 50% as a starting point for the 16+16 pixel version . ( I 've blown up the size of the latter for better viewing , though its obviously going to be a lot smaller . ) <p> Figure : Groups icon shown as vector outline and 32+32 pixel preview ( left two ) , with the scaled 16+16 versions of the same ( right two ) . <p> If you followed along with the previous article , you know that I 'm not going to be content leaving the smaller version as-is ; it reads a little too blurry and not as well-defined as the 32+32 version , so I need to tweak it for sharpness . The initial step is getting all the strokes to render as a full pixel , if needed . Depending on my settings for the scale tool they may already do so ( as in the above example ) , but it is possible that when I initially scaled it down my stroke widths also scaled down by 50% . In which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a stroke ( the outline in this case ) and set the stroke width back to 1px in the Stroke palette . <p> Next I want to make sure that the dominant lines within the icon fall on whole pixels . Any time I have a point straddling the line , I grab it and pull it back in to rest in the center of that pixel ( or push it out to the next pixel , whichever I feel more closely respects the original outline ) . The stroke then renders as a solid pixel line instead of dithering between two pixel columns . here 's an animated GIF showing this step : <p> Figure : Animation showing vector point being moved into place , reducing stroke to one solid pixel . <p> I repeat this for the rest of the lines where I think an adjustment would make a difference ; obviously straight lines are perfect candidates , but it can get a little tricky with angled lines and curves . In those cases I end up adjusting the handles on the points and try to force the pixels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the number of stray fringe pixels . If you go back up and check the first image , you might notice that the 16+16 pixellated version of the icon has a lot of lighter pixels around the outside . Eliminating as many of those as I can without warping the stroke makes the final icon a lot sharper . ( I end up spending a lot of time doing this kind of tweaking in my attempts to get it just right . ) <p> Finally , my interior shapes the shine on the user head and collarbone also need a bit of adjustment . In this case , they ought to be offset from the stroke by a one pixel gap . By dragging the points around to make room for the gap , and possibly adjusting the handles to keep the curves from distorting too badly , I can get the shapes closer to the effect I intended . If not , that 's potentially a detail I could sacrifice by eliminating the gap entirely , but in this case it seems to work alright . <p> here 's a progression @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ final icon , shown as pixels : <p> Figure : Progression of work on smaller icon , shown in pixel preview . First , original icon and strokes scaled down 50% . Second , same icon with strokes resized to 1px . Third , outline tweaked to place strokes back on the pixel grid . Last , interior details adjusted to better match original icon . <p> And here 's what the final vector outlines ended up looking like : <p> Figure : Progression of work on smaller icon , shown as vector outlines . <p> You can see there 's a big difference between my starting point and where I ended up . The outlines end up squashed and compressed as a trade-off for having the strokes fit the pixel grid , the fine details inside the icon look silly and out of scale compared to the original icon , and some shapes even overlap where they should n't . <p> That 's the way it works . You need to sacrifice clarity in vector preview for the sake of the pixels . If/when I decide to create a larger version ( resolution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , I 'm obviously going to start with the original 32+32 icon since its much closer to my intended vector outline . <p> Though , I suppose its worth mentioning that I do n't  reserve this kind of tweaking exclusively for resizing ; I do it with most icons , including the 32+32 size . So those original outlines are n't  exactly pristine either . Just so you know . <p> I 've found that having multiple views open in Illustrator is invaluable for doing this kind of manipulation . You can open a new view ( at least in OS X ) by selecting Window-&gt;New Window . Each window has its own View menu settings , so you can leave one window in Vector mode and another in Pixel Preview mode . I also find it helpful to have Hide Edges turned on and Bounding Boxes turned off in this window , so I can see exactly how I 'm changing things . <p> If I 'm feeling very anal-retentive , I 'll have three windows open , a Vector window that I 'm doing work in , a zoomed Pixel Preview window that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that shows the icon at 100% . <p> Also , as a personal preference , I would have stopped at the third 16x16 icon . <p> Its funny that you wrote a new article on this , because a friend of mine , who is starting to work with icons , e-mailed me today and asked me how to make his icons scale down nicely , and then as an example I pointed him to your previous post on the same subject . Hell be glad to hear that there is this new article now . <p> And replying to the comments above , To me the best way to work with small icons like this is in Photoshop , using vector masks and shapes . Its a shame that Photoshops stroke control is n't as good as Illustrators , though . <p> I wish Illustrator would give more control for pixel work . You would think its just a matter of setting a 1px grid and snapping to it But then if you give a 1px width to the a stroke it will render as 0.5 pixel on each side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pixels . <p> I found two workarounds but none is perfect : <p> - set a magnetic grid with 10px steps and 20 subdivisions , so you can snap your points to the middle of the pixels ( but its a pain to check if you 're on an even or odd row ) . <p> - set the grid to 10px with 10 subdivisions . In the Appearance palette you can drag the stroke *under* the fill , so basically when you set the width of the stroke to 2px , only 1px is visible AND you can snap to whole pixels ( but for 1px strokes with a transparent fill you still have to use half-pixels ) . <p> Another way to do it is to set your keyboard move increments to something lower than a pixel ( I think it defaults to 1px ) . That way , when it gets down to playing with individual anchor points , you 're only moving them around by a fraction of a pixel . I set mine to 0.1px , so when I shift-arrow it moves a whole pixel . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if you just need to align the stroke to the inside or outside of the path , as opposed to the center . The " align stroke " setting consists of three buttons on the stroke palette . I think that " center " is chosen by default . <p> However , I did a little test using this method along with snapping to a grid set to 1px . Strangely , strokes along the top and left sides of a path do n't  seem to render as they should . You can check out a screen shot LONG ... <p> If anyone has experienced this before and knows how to fix it , or if I 'm doing something dumb , please let me know . <p> Andrew , Illustrator CS and above has a thing called Pixel Preview ( under the View menu ) you could also set-up Illustrator to a 1 pixel grid for icon and web work . Not sure if you 'd want to snap to that grid though . Hope that helps . <p> @Jonathan Hardie - " Curious as to whether anyone is using @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for vector shapes , which makes it quite good for these kinds of things compared with illustrator and photoshop " <p> Fireworks default settings are better than Illustrator , I seem to recall . Getting shapes to snap to solid pixels was a given when first placing them . But I found after using it for a while that I still had to manually tweak anti-aliasing quite a bit , and given the focus of this post ( resizing existing artwork ) I do n't  imagine Fireworks would do any better or worse than Illustrator . <p> @Jonathan : I did a comprehensive iconset for a desktop app a couple of months back , and Fireworks pixel snapping comes in real handy . Although , you still have the option to fine-tune the position of the control points of shapes by zooming into the canvas , which I ended up doing a lot , in order to get the right balance of sharpness and anti-aliasing . <p> Having created many icons over the last couple of years as a small part of my job , I have to say that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be under estimated . This article provides clear and concise instructions and it works a treat ! <p> Excellent article and thanks Nick for the workspace suggestions . <p> If you are required to use transparent gifs without a matte , you may find the below information handy . <p> Once i 'm happy in Illustrator , i optimize in photoshop . <p> two methods help ; the first In photoshop , set up a grid via the Photoshop &gt; preferences &gt; transparency and Gamut menu . <p> set up the grid as small and work at 400% . This help identify any jaggys by displaying a 1px grid . <p> Secondly If i 'm being really pedantic , I 'll draw a high contrast 1px x 1px grid and set it as the background layer in photoshop . Drop in my smart object and set its layer blending mode to difference . Any jaggys will display vividly for easy optimization <p> Very well written , Dave . I work my icons in Corel Draw , and what I have always been doing is I save a very large version of the icon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ image to the necessary resolutions . Aliasing at the smallest resolutions have always been a problem that was resolved by manually editing the image pixel by pixel ( gasp ! ) just like back in the day when we actually had to draw stuff pixel by pixel : ) <p> As you can see in this article , creating good icons is by far more complex than you would expect if you design a small icon . There are many icon softwares which try to suggest that you can do this easily , but in my opinion the best software to create good icons are still the Adobe products like Illustrator or Photoshop . Several years ago I was also using Corel Draw but was so disappointed with it , so that Ive never come in touch with it so far . May be its now more user friendly . <p> With this article inspiring me I made my recent icon in Illustrator , adapting each each icon size from 16x16 to 256x256 to fit the pixelgrid . <p> Then I realise that Vista will only use the 16x16 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 256x256 icon and sample it down . And that causes real pain as 256x256 requires much more detail than 48x48 . <p> What 's worse is that sampling down from 256x256 to 96x96 which is the Vista default icons size makes all the pixels fall off the grid and become blurred . <p> Is there absolutely no way of making Vista use the closest available icon ? <p> Thanks for that fantastic article . Unfortunately I have just invested $300 in a set of webicons . With your help I am going to build my next icons myself ( and if I fail , I will buy one of your sets : - ) ) <p> Ive been applying these methods for web and presentation graphics for a while now and yet there seems no fixed or automatic way of achieving perfect results , some fine tuning on the end product is often necessary but I tend to leave the adjustments til the end . I 'm in favour of the pixel grid and often change my keyboard increments to 1 pixel ( for precision ) and 10 or 100 pixels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tend to use boxes and if possible anything with a stroke I set to inner stroke . However the shape has to be complete in order to do this eg. a 3 sided box will default to a central stroke and therefore cause these anomalies . Remember , its easy to change your strokes to shapes via the outline stroke cmd but in my experience making things into boxes does n't  eradicate the spill of colour into new pixels so again , some editing of the graphics is required . However , too much and you 'll experience jagged lines which is why the anti-aliasing is there in the first place ! I find the best method is to create in illustrator and then import into PS , I also import the vector paths into PS to help with selections for editing . <p> After purchasing so many icon sets ( and now that I have a little time on my hands ) I am about to design my own set - thanks for the tips above , I will be trying them out . I just hope I can pull @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but there is some difference . Usually I start from relatively big vector image that contains the basic shapes of future icon . Then I resize it down to 48x48 and add all details I need . When the icon is finished , I resize it down to 32x32 and/or 24x24 , delete all tiny details that spoil legibility , and increase stroke widths . I prefer to use Xara Xtreme for this ( love it for its perfect Curve tool ) so I have to suffer a little - there is no simple ways to control pixel rendering in Xara . As of 16x16 size , I prefer either to completely redraw icon for this size ( some times pixel-by-pixel in Photoshop ) or to refine its rasterization ( Photoshop again ) . To illustrate the words above , here is a sample of how it looks like when LONG ... <p> I am just getting started in icon work , and I am using Illustrator to create the initial designs . As I am utilising the 512px x 512px capabilities that Leopard offers , I am creating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ However , I do resize down to all the usual suspects using Icon Builder plugin . <p> From this article though I am noticing that you are starting small and building up . <p> I use Grids and Snap to grid always while trying to Design my icons . They have always been helpful , and I believe such minor tools in Photoshop has always gone un-noticed , but they have the ultimate potential . 30455 @qwx890455 30451 @qwx890451 <p> You are reading " Icon Design : Anti-Aliasing " , an entry posted on 11 July , 2007 , to the Ancient collection .

@@99593420 @3793420/ <p> Its a new year , so its time for a slight change of direction . You may have noticed your feed reader of choice just barfed up a few dozen posts from these here parts . I 'm hoping that little bit of necessary unpleasantness will be one time only . <p> Ive come to realize that my content-creating has become a lot more distributed , which means the long-form post format of this site has been seeing less and less love in recent years . Much has been written about Twitter killing the urge to write longer blog posts , and I wont dispute that as a cause . I liked Andy Budds take on why his site has been suffering , I can relate to a lot of those reasons . <p> So for the past month Ive been working on a way of piecing together content I produce on other sites and funnel relevant bits into a stream that I could present on this site . <p> Totally nuts , right ? The volume will be too high , and nobody wants to see every photo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with while out for dinner . So that 's why I 'm exercising editorial control and only bringing over the bits and pieces I 've hash- or machine-tagged . <p> On Twitter I 'm using a hash tag ( #mb ) which shows up in the original , but I 'm stripping from the on-site version . Google Reader pulls in shared items tagged with mezzoblue . And I 'm just throwing in everything from Delicious for now , since I got into the habit of using it for the now-deprecated mezzoblue Dailies . <p> I 'm still not sure if I 'm going to write up the scripts I built to make this happen , or package it up into some kind of actual open source release . I think the latter way would be more interesting , but there 's a lot of work that would have to happen to get to something even slightly worthy of putting out there for public consumption . <p> Now I do realize that not everyone will want this of course , so the way this site used to work is n't gone . You can follow the clutter free post-only feed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ archive pages . Both are accessible from the main archives page , and will continue to exist . Its just the defaults that have changed , but you can go ahead and ignore all the new stuff if you want . <p> Expect a few bugs as I stress-test my scripts live over the next few weeks , and let me know if you find anything horribly wrong . <p> Update : and first major bug has been found : the full Atom feeds werent ready for prime time at all . For now Ive backed out and made the default feed post-only again until I can figure out what 's causing old items to duplicate . Sorry about the collateral damage to your feed reader . <p> That 's similar to what I 'm doing on my relaunched site , except I 'm running cron jobs on the server to make the API calls ( Tumblr/Delicious , All Consuming , Flickr , and Twitter in my case ) and then inserting the data directly into my site database . Different RSS feeds then give visitors the choice of blog only or blog plus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my own database is that it affords the opportunity to present the link ( and my comments ) in context , and invite comments ( similar to how Jeff Crofts site handles his linklog ) . <p> I had n't  considered including tweets in my RSS - I do n't  think Ive ever said anything that interesting on Twitter <p> I think all of us who have been on the web for a while are ending up doing this sort of thing in a way or another . The personal site is no longer the end-all , be-all of content it used to be , but rather a place we can use as a hub to concentrate all the bits and pieces we generate that end up scattered all over the web now . Zeldman summarized this brilliantly a while ago ( http : //is.gd/9nb ) . <p> That 's precisely what I am doing on my own site as well . If you see the home page , besides the main menu and doodles , there 's the latest three Twiter posts displayed , the latest 15 or so Flickr photos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the site by means of a special tag . <p> Since Ive never been much of a programmer I 'm pulling all this out by means of a few customized Wordpress plugins , and I wish I knew a way to select the tweets I want to show on the site by means of a tag as you suggest above ( I 'd rather not have replies and other irrelevant messages show up there ) . Will be interesting to see how your developments on these matters will turn out . <p> It sounds like this will be the first recognizable web trend in 2009 . I 'm in the process of making a similar conversion myself but will be doing so using Matthews logic above . I still want Mike Industries to be permanent home for all of that stuff not some random third party services I happen to be using at the time . Youve probably set yours up so they live in your database , which is great , but I think the ability to comment on everything is essential ( although some people I know feel the opposite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stuff ) . <p> @Matthew Pennell - I took a slightly different approach . I initially tried to avoid storing anything locally and run it all off RSS feeds , but realized I had to use the APIs in order to get anything past the most recent 15 or so items . <p> In the end I gave in and went with a file system-based cache instead of a database . Nothings running live , unless the cache has expired ( some live for 15 mins , older ones live forever ) . Its good enough for now , and did manage to give me enough control to write out custom Atom feeds with and without the extra stuff . <p> @Joey Baker - if Tumblr has an API that can return an RSS/Atom/other XML file for a specific date range ( the date range is essential for the way I 've got things set up ) then it could fairly easily be adapted to work with the scripts I 'm using . <p> @Geoff - had n't  heard of Sweetcron , but it looks close to what I 'm doing here . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comment . <p> @Kenneth - fixed . <p> @Ethan - and thank you sir . I was a bit leery that the increased volume would be a problem , but so far the response seems to be positive . Having opt-out ability is pretty key , I 'd say . <p> @Beto - the Twitter Search API is what I used . Getting the data in from the API actually was n't terribly difficult with a bit of PHP knowledge and a few minutes reading the documentation , it was the processing and doing something useful with it that took a bit more work . I 'm using a PHP library called MiniXML to parse the query results , and then my own custom stuff to do the rest . Not sure if that helps a non-programmer , but I do n't  really consider myself much of one and I figured it out , so hopefully its not that hard . I 'll see what I can do about providing some more concrete code that will help you out . <p> @Mike D. - I thought about permalinks and comments for all the off-site @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but that 's next on my list . <p> I chose not to do comments though . I used to run a linkblog ( Dailies ) that was first its own Movable Type blog , then lived in Delicious . In the first incarnation comments were open , but after a few hundred links there were only a handful of useful comments . So I 'm of the mind that comments on links are pretty much pointless . Photo comments could be a bit more meaningful , but I 'm just passing the comments through to Flickr cause it does n't  make sense to have those live in two different places . ( Maybe one day I 'll do some slick data back and forth to post comments to Flickr directly from a form on here , but Ive thrown back enough Tylenol already for now ) <p> Definitely a trend for 2009 , And also looking for do this with cron jobs ( actually looking for a easier way , messing with the wp admin , to make it control the where everything should go , from its own interface ) <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should start a list or something to help other to do this even if we do not completely open our sources <p> I like that you cached it locally in the FS . I do it differently on a few sites , but I mostly cache to a local DB - allowing it to be used in connection with a bigger picture of things . Somewhat of 2 layers of caching , pulling in the API ( by cron + rake task ) , then page/action caching different elements . Still gives me the speed factor , while also giving me the flexibility to use the data models however I see fit . <p> Not sure this is a new trend ( per Mike D. ) - but I do see more and more people moving towards pulling their content into their own domain . I like to push and pull the content , but ultimately its about really interacting with the APIs . <p> I love that you go above and beyond the typical JS widgets - those seem almost useless to me . The real power comes when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into a bigger system . Well done : ) <p> I 'd be very excited to get ANY sort of peek behind the curtain , especially to see your technique for Flickr . I 'm another of the masses who are starting to tackle this right now , and I 'd hate to re-invent the wheel . <p> Beyond the news , though , I just thought I 'd issue a more general compliment for your entire site . I 've visited many times over the years , but for some reason Ive never really taken in the completeness of it all . Its a very well-cared-for little home on the web . <p> Ive been looking at doing this on my site for some time now , but scripting it from scratch seems to be well over my head . I 've looked into some EE plugins , but havent found anything suitable yet . Perhaps 2009 will be the year I get it figured . <p> @Spencer - that 's certainly the goal . I 'm planning on using them sparingly , and only if they feel on-topic and relevant for this site . <p> @Nate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the raw source , but realized that the hit of parsing XML on every page request made that a little silly . In the end I ditched the library and just wrote everything directly to PHP files . <p> And yeah , the JS widgets never really felt like a good solution in my mind . Tack-on content is a second class citizen , and I 'd like to do it in a way that makes everything I chose to post here first class . <p> @Jonathan Snook - good call , never thought of that . Actually I do n't  think I knew you could even favourite your own , ala Flickr . The big downside I can see is that other services make assumptions about why someone Favourites ( cough Favrd cough ) that a ) would n't be true in that case , and b ) make me look like a self-promoting tool . Hash tags on tweets are lame , but for now seem like the best fit . <p> @punkassjim - alright , will see what I can do . I might write up some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and display ) in separate posts , but I 'd have to modify my source to do it in a way that each build off each other . Still , that might be the best way to get this out there . For now I 'd recommend taking a look at the Flickr REST API , its well-documented , and armed with a bit of PHP knowledge and the MiniXML library you can probably go further than you 'd think in a few hours of tinkering . <p> @Jason Landry - yeah , I would n't say its a small undertaking , there are a lot of individual little problems to solve along the way that can be head-scratching . You might want to check out the sweetcron.com tool mentioned in a previous comment , still in beta but might be what you need . <p> Oh , and a general note in case you missed the post update the full Atom feed was n't working out , so I 've backed out to post-only for now . Every time a source updated , all the posts from that source refreshed in the feed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - Its a good resource , and it actually gets me about 80% to where I want to be . But , two things : 1 ) I 'd like to keep the number of ready-made plugins down , and 2 ) since its just based on RSS feeds , there is n't as much information to play around with , so it kinda limits the possibilities . For example , in Daves system , with every Flickr post , it shows how many comments that photo has at any given time . <p> @punkassjim - nope , they 're coming straight out of the API along with the rest of the data . You have to run two queries , one to search for photo IDs that meet your criteria , then a second to get the info from those photos . The second one is when the comments show up , then I just plug em in with everything else . <p> In terms of how often they 're updated , well , that 's still a problem I 'm working through . Relatively recent data is being refreshed once an hour ( you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see if the cache has expired when someone loads the page and run the request live if it has , which is what I 'm doing ) . <p> But the flaw in my plan is that Twitters Search API promises to only show results for the last six months , so older than that and if I refresh my cache to get Flickr comments ( or even blog comments , though usually after six months they 're closed anyway ) I lose Twitter posts for that range . Right now everything older than 6 months is permanently cached . The only way I can see around this is putting it all into a database , which I so did n't  want to have to do . 30455 @qwx890455 30451 @qwx890451 <p> You are reading " Not a Test " , an entry posted on 3 January , 2009 , to the Misty collection .

@@99593421 @3793421/ <p> What I love about these pages is how they take advantage of the medium to produce an end result which is just about impossible to pull off in the real world . Though I have to admit , after viewing them , I 'm still not sure I 've quite wrapped my mind around such huge numbers For more like this , see also : Exploration . <p> The only real-world equivalent I know of is ; if a pea representing the size of a nucleus was placed in the centre of a football stadium , the equivalent size of the atom would reach to the outer limits of the car park . <p> I saw both of these , but for better or worse , scrollbars tend to hide the huge size of the pages . Dragging the scrollbar can get you across that large distance as quickly as it can a much smaller page , so you do not absorb the size . On the other hand , holding the scroll arrow is slow and does not give much feedback , which makes it too tedious to learn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this one would be impossible outside of this medium , but the medium actually makes the distance seem less significant . <p> A real world comparison ca n't afford such a straight-forward visualization , but it may yield better understanding . Especially with the hydrogen atom , where the picture gives a false sense of what the particles are and how they behave , a less direct analogy , like comparing a second to years , may work better . <p> I am with you , while it makes me think I still cant quite grasp the sheer number these represent . Even deeper still , each pixel represents a unique individual with goals , hopes , problems , etc the complexity of it all : ) <p> Those pages are really cool . The first one made me feel really insignificant . I am this tiny dot , and I cant even see 1% of the screen at the same time . The second one did n't  work that well , though . The empty space of just dragging a scrollbar does n't  convey it . <p> While the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't  impress that much . <p> And there are actually quite some good real life examples to show things these size . But they are quite a lot of work to put up . I remember a valley in Switzerland where theyd put up a lot of huge and small globes which would represent the size of the planets and the sun . And they where placed scattered around the whole valley representing the distance between them . Worked quite nicely , though pluto was to far away , i believe we missed it . <p> BTW , the second example is actually completely wrong , an electron does n't  have a size it just depicts the radius of influence from the first electron which is even harder to imagine . <p> Granted the graphics are a bit splotchy but this one gives some quick perspective in a digestible form:http : **34;271;TOOLONG " Shes one in a million , no wait 6.5 billion , she 's a beauty .

I must say that Ive never been fan of Al Gore but I have to give him big Kudos for this movie . <p> This site uses crazy java code to harvest human feelings from a large number of weblogs . Every few minutes , the system searches the worlds newly posted blog entries for occurrences of the phrases " I feel " and " I am feeling " . <p> The result is a database of several million human feelings , increasing by 15,000 - 20,000 new feelings per day . Using a series of playful interfaces , the feelings can be searched and sorted across a number of demographic slices <p> Nothing to do with the worlds populationthis is more like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and enjoy = ) <p> For a concept as simple as Population:One , its design is utterly atrocious . In all honesty , for what its trying to convey , I would nominate the site for worst design of the year . <p> First of all , as a Mac user , I had to go to my bench-warming 3rd string browser ( Firefox ) to even get the correct illustration . For a site that only has one idea to get across , youd think browser compatibility couldve been easily addressed . <p> Second , as others have pointed out , the necessity to scroll to the right really deadens the effect of this site . Obviously no scrolling would be optimal , but even having it scroll downwards would be more logical for everyone and would make the point easier to visualize . <p> Then there 's the color scheme and use of extraneous design elements . This is a page that uses pixels to tell you something you ca n't be tossing unrelated pixels around everywhere just to make things prettier . The page should be stark and baron @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immediate focus on the chunk of 6.5 million px , and no confusion over whether this maroon box or this black header is somehow connected to the pixel count . <p> Horriffic design hopefully the author will clean the thing up before it gains any popularity . <p> No rage , no animosity just seems to me that if someone is attempting to make one extremely simple yet profound statement , they ought to make sure its extremely simple , and they ought to make sure its profound . The page you 've linked to there does not succeed in doing either as far as Im concerned . I found the poor design decisions to be much more interesting than the point the page was trying to make . <p> What I gleaned from those examples is that the size of a point on the screen is relative to the space around it . <p> What I gleaned from the comments is that points must be small , since when someone tries to make one , everyone else misses it . <p> I have to echo what you said within the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Why would people rather comment on the aesthetic or the sensibility of the thing , rather than appreciate the scope its trying to convey ? I do n't  think it takes a lot of imagination to overcome whatever interface hangup you may have about it . If you cant appreciate just how many pixels they 're talking about in both examples , do you ever actually work with a computer screen ? <p> To everyone who thinks these examples do n't  get the job done , I say put your code where your mouth is . If you dislike it so intensely , build the proverbial better mousetrap . And to those who would reply to that with " Its not an interesting enough experiment to waste my time on " I 'd counter with " it was interesting enough for you to a ) click on , and b ) criticize , so yes , I do think its interesting enough " . <p> I really liked both and they did help me picture the total insignifigance of the individual and the total signifigance of atoms size . <p> I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person in 6.5billion and he is essentially nothing .

@@99593422 @3793422/ <p> You might assume , having written a book on the subject , that I would be intimately familiar with all the ins and outs of the CSS spec .

Sometimes I get to thinking I 'd really like some way to do x with CSS , and it turns out its actually been around for the better part of a decade . <p> For example , every time I style an ordered list I wish there were some way to style list item counters independently of the content . Sure you could wrap extra markup around the content to achieve that somewhat , but its not always practical and rarely desirable . <p> But , there is a way . There 's the counter-increment and counter-reset properties . As a part of generated content , I 've simply overlooked them .

@@99593424 @3793424/ <p> During the portion of his talk where he discussed image replacement and its impact on findability , he addressed the white elephant question that has likely occurred to most designers who have used image replacement over the past five years or so : what does Google think of CSS image replacement , anyway ? But the part that surprised me is that he actually had an answer : Googles okay with it , you wont be penalized for using image replacement properly . <p> Though Ive long believed this to be true , I had never heard a conclusive answer . One assumes Google is smart , and their algorithms ought to know the difference between keyword-stuffed text and plain English content written for real people . For example , I 've often wondered if the potential to abuse image replacement and load invisible text with keywords was akin to , say , the potential to stuff keywords into the alt text of img elements , or even into meta tags . The net result seems similar in all three cases : otherwise-invisible text on a page that could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to detect keyword-stuffing on the other two elements would equally apply to text hidden with CSS . <p> Not to mention the more compelling evidence that numerous sites Ive built using image replacement techniques fare well in Googles ranking . That fact alone indicates that Google wont ban a site for simply making use of image replacement techniques ( though Im sure they 've banned numerous sites using the technique in a sneaky , black hat SEO manner ) . <p> But again , I 've never heard of an official blessing from Google . So I did some searching , and asked him for some follow-up ( thanks , Aaron ! ) , and here are the relevant resources that came out of that conversation : <p> The second bullet ( " including text behind an image " ) accurately describes a few image replacement techniques . Its mentioned in the context of being a potentially untrustworthy activity , followed by a warning of the consequences of using it incorrectly . However , further down the page , the focus changes to techniques used for the sake of accessibility and why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with assistive technology may not be able to access . This is a fairly accurate description of the intent behind image replacement . The article also suggests a handy rule of thumb for judging these techniques on your own : show the Googlebot the same thing your visitors see . Properly-used image replacement passes that test . <p> See point #2 in regards to sIFR , an ideologically similar concept to CSS image replacement , which suffers from the same potential abuse vectors . As this is a Google blog , it appears sIFR has an official blessing . Also mentioned in this article is a similar guideline to the previous one : show users and the Googlebot the same content . Sensing a theme here ? <p> So it appears that , short of a set of stone tablets carried down from the hills of Mountain View , we do have a fairly clear answer . Using CSS image replacement in a responsible way , where the image truthfully represents the content its replacing , is safe to use . The simple act of hiding text from users is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Very good news Dave although not really surprising to me ; I mean , that 's how things are expectedto work in the modern Web . <p> In my opinion , generally speaking , when something non-textual has to replace something textual ( via CSS , for instance ) , the textual fallback representation must always be provided : first , because we care about users ; second , because we also care about " special " users such as bots and source analyzers like those of Google ; ) <p> Of course it is good to know that Google has " implemented " the right intuition of things ! <p> Dave , to add to your comment about the SEO success of the sites you 've built for your clients using image replacement - Apple.com has one of the highest PageRanks on the Web with a score of 9 out of 10 possible . Their navigation uses the Leahy/Langridge Method and they are certainly not being penalized for it . <p> In order for a site to be blacklisted as the German BMW site was in 2006 ( see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it in person . This means that if you 're using image replacement legitimately ( ie. the text in your image matches the text in the element where the switharoo occurs ) the webspam team will not mistake your good deed for a black hat trick . <p> I was under the impression that the potential for penalties from search engines for hiding content with CSS only applied to inline styling and not to anything contained in external stylesheets . Maybe that notion is out of date ? As an added security measure , I 've always disallowed indexing of my CSS directory with robots.txt . <p> I think another interesting question to ask relating to the use of images for text is whether an image-replaced piece of content has any more SEO weight than the same image in the HTML ( not CSS ) with the text contained within the alt attribute ? <p> This is such good news ! And thank you very much for writing it down , now I can reference it in the future . <p> We had a client last year who used another firm for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they said that 's why they werent getting their search results . Justification finally ! Hurrah ! <p> Thanks for the timely post . Image replacement is really at the heart of the whole X in xhtml logic . A stylesheet can make the images fit where they need to go given the media , even mobile design structure from the same xhtml page . <p> This information is sort of a relief for all people working on accessible websites . We long have been insecure about Google handling stuff that was hidden via css to serve visitors with assistive technologies . <p> It is good to get this confirmed , great job Aaron ! So basically , all regular image replacement techniques are safe , because a penalty will occur after a human inspection ( as what happened to the German BMW site ) ? <p> I 'm glad someone finally addressed this issue and backed it up with some reputable sources . Thanks for posting this , Dave . <p> I 've had the pleasure of meeting up with Aarron several times since SXSW 07 . He is an intelligent , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this industry . Evaluation of markup strategies like image replacement is just one the aspects of findability that he covers in his book:http : **31;307;TOOLONG <p> Yes , that was a blatant book plug , but since Aarron did n't  do so in his comment , I figured somebody had to mention his book . : ) <p> Ole Hook , I do n't  see how your version of image replacement would be any different according to Google . But now that you know Google wont penalize you for using " display:none " on that span tag , it would make your code shorter and would avoid any possibility of someone who has a browser width of 10,000 pixels ever seeing it which I know does n't  exist , but you never know if it ever will exist on a really , really big screen someday . Maybe some little guy with a complex will invent that . : -P <p> I had an argument ( as in exchange of ideas ) with a collegue a month ago . He *discovered* that I used an image replacement tehnique on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an image contiaing the same text it displayed ; I had used your revised image replacement , however his main concern ( being somewhat SEO obssesed ) was that this will impact its page rank , thus the position in the google page search results . So it was never a question if this is enough to get our clients website banned . <p> uhmm , maybe its a n00b question , but why everyone assumes that googlebot is aware that some text is being image-replaced via css ? <p> I mean , that would imply the bot has to parse tons of html and external css files , request image files ecc and in the end figure out if major browsers could render the page so that some images obscure some other text . <p> Abu , Google already does a lot of work parsing massive amounts of HTML , not to mention the work done with that parsed HTML to rank pages effectively according to relevancy . Checking the CSS for common methods that hide content is really not that difficult in comparison to what they 're already doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ penalise anything based on its analysis of your CSS because it can change after the page loads . For example , you might hide a div with display:none until the user mouses over a particular area of the page . <p> Thus , Google has to resort to language analysis to detect keyword stuffing , and links to determine a level of trust in the page . <p> @ Dave : " One assumes Google is smart , and their algorithms ought to know the difference between keyword-stuffed text and plain English content written for real people . " <p> You 're right there . For anyone who needs convincing on Googles intelligence , take a look at the two articles written by Sergey Brin that Ive linked to below " they provide an insight into the sheer thought that has gone into Google , as well as how it works " under the hood " . <p> A quick glimpse at these should convince you not to worry about things like image replacement , the off-left technique , or using the odd display : none rule to hide a skip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ugly , long-winded links into " tiny URLs " because I do n't  want to be responsible for breaking your layout ( I 'm good like that ! ) . Also , the documents are only available in Postscript and PDF respectively , so Ive linked to the HTML versions generated by Google . <p> I spoke with Google about this about a year ago and it was put to me quite matter-of-factly : They do n't  care about legitimate uses of hiding text for design and accessibility , that they check before pulling the plug , and that logic and common-sense is applied . <p> Which raises the questions that I 've asked in several SEO forums over time ( but never got a conclusive response to ) : if Google has been told to ignore your CSS files , and assuming that it honours that instruction , how then can it determine when CSS has been used to hide text in the markup ? External CSS must , by now , be more prevalent than styles placed in the head of the page after all . Does it simply look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ image replacement ? That would be quite a big assumption to make I 'm sure that image replacement is not the only use for an empty span . <p> We 've just begun to use CSS sprites with one client - and I never thought about this particular approach to introducing descriptive text . <p> Sprites are not very mainstream yet , but they certainly can help download speed by reducing the number of http connections . With google putting more and more emphasis on the end user experience when they click on google search results , all those factors that improve page speed seem to be potentially helpful in ranking . <p> Im I 'm correct , a " no follow " will prevent an engine from indexing a page but they will still read it , nonetheless . They will still see your styles which is how they know if you are using black hat techniques . <p> There 's a thread on Webmaster Google Groups LONG ... about this from last June , where one of the Googlers went and checked with Matt Cutts ( head of Google spam ) and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mentioned , it should n't be a problem . However his answer also makes it clear it puts you one step closer to the grey area . All things considered , if this is the extent of what you 're worried about with regards to Google mis-interpreting , I think you 're very much on the safe side of things : ) <p> ps. is it just me or does the checkbox for Remember me stretch about the same width as these other input fields ? Intentional ? <p> Thank so much for the straightforward answer to this question . I will use this as justification to all my clients to use image-replacement and/or sIFR . <p> Is sIFR more desirable than image-replacement or some other method ? <p> Good point about us bowing to Google , God help us if they ever decided to say image-replacement is " bad ! " I 'm not at all anti-Google , but seriouslyits a point to consider . Kinda like trying to boycott Wal-mart . <p> Thank you for this . I 'm really glad to have a definitive and documented position from Google , but there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with John ( #4 ) in wondering whether , in creating a Heading that contains an image , there is a difference in the SEO value placed on actual text versus alt= " text " ? Is the alt= " text " parsed and if so , is it considered heading content when attached to an image inside the heading tag ? I 'd rather use a direct HTML img than a background CSS image since it is still displayed when CSS is turned off and is printable ( and yes , I know I could serve a different stylesheet for printing ) . Nonetheless , it makes a big difference on choice of technique to know this . <p> Yet , this is a bit of a moot question today since only some browsers display the alt text - and quite differently at that - with images turned off , making this technique a questionable choice for accessibility to all users in that it requires browser dependent stylesheets . I 'm so tired of having to make bad coding decisions in order to accommodate non-compliant browser software . <p> Is there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ style that would suggest choosing HTML text rather than alt= " text " ? It feels like there should be . Both techniques work efficiently , but one requires no real text in the markup while the other requires an additional non-content tag . Does this point to why one method might produce better SEO results ? On the other hand , I often indirectly include style coding in the HTML by accessing CSS through spans and classes to change font colours mid heading , for example or changing the intended function/style of a tag which seems just as muddled . Theoretically they should be the same , but my gut says that real text is a better choice . I 'd love to know how G sees it . <p> Second , I am astounded that G suggests we should use a javascript or flash technique instead of simple CSS for image replacement when the whole point is to increase accessibility ! I 'm already jumping through hoops to make sure my site degrades properly and is still completely comprehensible without images , CSS , and javascript ( which I add @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ site is built ) and altering font sizes . I 'm a tiny independent business and I cant imagine adding more techniques that depend on client-side functioning that hold the potential to interfere with my presentation - I find it hard to believe it would be a technique of choice for a massive site . <p> On the other hand , if font substitution without downloading or client-side installation is something we want I have just read about FLIR ( http : **25;340;TOOLONG ) - a much simpler font replacement technique ( sorry Mike ) with solid promise using only javascript and real ( not flash ) fonts that returns a scalable image styled with CSS . Perhaps , at least for headings and menu/navigation links , this debate might soon end . <p> An important issue this and possibly reopened for debate . Google has clearly changed something last month ( Sep 08 ) as I have seen a dramatic drop in page rank on some client sites for very relevant key words . I am not alone on this either . <p> My own site has also jumped dramatically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one but it is very odd . <p> I 'm really glad that someone has managed to straighten this out . Over the last 3 weeks we have been trying to reach a conclusion over the strategy on this subject . <p> I 've noticed instances of both good use and bad use of image replacement , be it sIFR or any image replacement technique . The puzzling thing to me is that the bad use of this technique ( meaning black-hat use ) , is n't getting unscrupulous users of it banned by Google . Which can only mean they wait for these sites to be reported , and its done by hand ( so-to-speak ) . <p> We recently updated our website where we were using the Phark Method to do the switcheroo on the H1 tag . <p> At the time I had read somewhere that Google took a relaxed view on the idea of image replacement . So I added one or two extra keywords to the hidden text in the tag ( literally ) and updated the website . <p> After a week or so I did notice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so for a number of weeks afterwords ! We actually slipped 7 pages as a direct result of this . <p> I think that maybe someone had brought it to Googles attention ( maybe a competitor ) , and Google had picked it up and penalised us for this breach of the proper use of the image replacement technique . <p> Obviously , we now have everything swapped back to the correct use of the technique , where the image matches the text but nevertheless an interesting experiment ! <p> I wonder what Google thinks of hiding text using one of the least used CSS properties : clip . <p> A simple image replacement technique we use ( alas , with a SPAN around the text ) works like this : <p> A width:whatever ; height:whatever ; background:whatever ; <p> A SPAN position:absolute ; clip:rect ( 0 0 0 0 ) ; <p> I suppose it does n't  work with screen readers , since the text is effectively hidden ( I havent tried it though ) . But I wonder how it compares to display:none or visibility:hidden for Google , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my understanding of the way google ranks websites starts -with the number and quality of inbound links to a given page and the -associated keyphrases contained in the anchor text . -the keyphrases in the title for the page -the keyphrases in the h1 and h2 tag if any -the keypphrases in the first paragraph and last paragraph of text on the page -etc <p> And so , I do n't  think that using image replacement to replace ( eg ) the text in the h1 element would have a significant effect on a web pages ranking in the google search engine results pages for a given web page . ( If the google bot was n't able to index that text ) <p> Very little happens , I think , to a web pages rank for a given keyphrase by stuffing the keyphrase 100 times into the alt tag for example . Google does n't  give a web page a better rank if you increase the number of instances of a keyphrase appearing in the webpage from a small number to a large number . Hence there is n't any need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to collect the text that would have been in your h1 tag because it is n't that important in googles algorithm . 30455 @qwx890455 30451 @qwx890451 <p> You are reading " Image Replacement + Google " , an entry posted on 5 May , 2008 , to the Park collection .

@@99593425 @3793425/ <p> The web has come a long way in the past decade . CSS3 , HTML5 , responsive web design , web fonts , a version of Internet Explorer that does n't  make you want to commit seppuku every time you debug , and any other progress that we already take for granted . ( You can get a sense of just how far we 've come by reading the original cringe-worthy requirements . ) <p> As you can probably imagine , I 've had a lot of proposals for a " CSS Zen Garden for X " over the years . Javascript , PHP , the mobile web , CSS3 , HTML5 , ebooks , responsive web design . ( And curiously , Joomla . There have been a disproportionate number of Joomla copycats/ripoffs over the years . What is it about that CMS ? ) <p> I 've never been in a hurry to create a new site for any of those ; part of what made the original work is that we were stuck in a time when no one was considering CSS seriously . It had an agenda @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Garden does n't  need to exist , because who is n't using those at this point ? <p> But still it might be fun . <p> There has n't  been a conference yet where someone did n't  corner me about a modern update . I 've seen many blog posts over the years about why we need a responsive or CSS3 version of the site . Even more convincingly , Ive seen blog posts about why the original has outlived its effectiveness as a teaching aid . <p> So for the tenth anniversary , the Zen Garden is open for business once more . I 've thrown the codebase on Github , given the dusty copy a refresh , started the conversion of the site to HTML5 , and brought all of the existing designs kicking and screaming into the modern age . The work is n't done yet , but its a darn sight closer to how we would build it these days . If you see an area that needs help , consider sending a patch . ( Heres the current list of issues to resolve , for example . ) <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time around : <p> CSS3 is in . Transitions , gradients , shadows , whatever . Just make sure to properly prefix it for all browsers . Webkit-only designs will be discarded with prejudice . <p> Responsive is so in . You do n't  have to build a responsive version of your design , but it would n't be a bad idea . It might even be a great idea . <p> Web fonts ? Sure . Though I 'm not quite sure how you 're gon na pull it off . TypeKit and other hosted services that require tag insertion are out , and licensing probably means you should n't submit your purchased font files . If you can work out some other way to make it work legally , go nuts , but its looking like free fonts are your best friend here . <p> Its both inspiring and heartbreaking to me that after 10 years , college and university instructors are still assigning a Zen Garden theme as part of the curriculum . <p> Its inspiring because its a great assignment . Students are given HTML and must use CSS to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ markup and presentation , and students learn to push the bounds of CSS . <p> Its heartbreaking because were teaching the same code we 've been teaching for 10 years . <p> Thank you for updating this . I hope the colleges and universities finally update their curricula to match , teaching HTML5 , CSS3 , and responsive design , and stop letting Internet Explorer 6/7 be the excuse for modernizing the curriculum . <p> where is Opera on the browsers list ? its the best out there , at least for css standards . they even help define css . <p> they seem to be going in the wrong direction now . still , their browser is still great . and yes , i 'm writing thing on Firefox , on a public library computer . still , Opera should be the reference for the css part of a site . <p> Just wanted to thank you . I owe a large part of my career to CSS Zen Garden . The project helped shape my view of what was possible with web standards and CSS . My submission was also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helped me land a number of jobs . Glad to see it back in business . <p> I am very happy to see you updating this . I have been out there probably three times this past year hoping to see that you have made a change . I will be glad to see what comes of it . Thanks so much this was a great source of inspiration early on , and still fun to revisit from time to time . <p> I am just so happy about this . CSS Zen Garden basically changed the playing field for the whole industry it will be nice to see how it is approached in 2013 ! I hope to find some time to submit something . <p> Happy 10th ! We used CSS Zen Garden for a class assignment , and it was the thing that opened my eyes and made everything I was learning about website html and css fall into place . To be able to see the CSS the designers used - Under the Sea was my favorite - was so helpful and a wonderful privilege . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and weeks in awe of the effects I could create with it . Thanks for your efforts in creating the site and now updating it . It may be the inspiration I need to start playing again ! <p> What a great resource to have come back . I agree that the justification element is n't needed anymore ( I remember feeling very excited when I first discovered CSS Zen Garden in 04 or 05 ) and understood how important it was to teach the idea of CSS as an essential tool . <p> But I see an opportunity here to do the same sort of boundary pushing/best practice discussion/proof of concept work that the original was beautiful for . <p> Sure , there are resources today for like codepen , that allow for specific exploration of one idea , but this showcases the marriage of tech and design like nothing else . <p> Great to see it open back up I 'm one that also had their life change because of CSS Zen Garden . My design ( #182 ) helped me realize how much I wanted to learn more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the role of teaching ( a couple of years after my submission ) . Yes , I 'm one of those professors who still assigns the Zen Garden Theme challenge ( with modified restrictions over the past couple of years ) . Students have always enjoyed the challenge of the Zen Garden competition and look forward to seeing the new designs . The first 20-100 entries , I expect , will showcase flat design . ; ) <p> Maybe this will finally inspire me to get my own ( woefully out-of-date ) website updated . <p> Couple of questions , Dave <p> Q : If we have an official design , can we send you an updated link if we change our portfolio website URL ? <p> Q : Was there a reason not to add the meta element with the viewport ? Just wondering . <p> @Thomas - great questions . #1 - yes , absolutely . #2 - good catch ! I ran out of time , there 's still more to be done . That 's a large part of the reason its on Github now , to allow people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ add that one myself tonight , thanks for the nudge . ) <p> I added a submission to this site so long ago , 2003 or 2004 that its no longer hosted on the server it once was . The company went under during the RealEstate bust . At any rate , shows you how I used CSS Zen Garden to turn my web design and development from tables coupled with WYSIWYG to pure vim or another text editor with semantic HTML and CSS . <p> CSS Zen inspired me to learn CSS 10 years ago when I was still a grubby high schooler with ethernet cable running down my parents hallway to my room . I had a P166 and 13in CRT that I 'd brought home from school on the schoolbus over several days time . Now I do web development for my job . Glad to see it making a comeback to inspire the next generation . <p> @Mayu - definitely on the agenda ! The whole reason for adding the site to Github was to allow people who actually speak the language to figure out the best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> You might also be happy to learn that while I 've heard complaints about some translations , I 've never heard any about yours . I 've even mentioned in talks I 've given that the Japanese translation is one of the better ones . Thanks for your work all those years ago ! <p> Good stuff . I cut my teeth with webmonkey.com and Netscape composer back in the day ! Years later a buddy told me about tableless layouts and housing styles in an external file and I was like no Fn way ! Haha . <p> I guess I came into the web world late , in 2005-6 so I never learned how to use tables to build web sites . When I had to update a web site , I used CSS and never have used tables , that was a decision I made early on when I started learning HTML and CSS . The future did teach me that this was a wise decision . I am looking forward to updates to this site and the addition of new entries using udated HTML and CSS code . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite a long period of time . I wish I had paid attention to the web front end development earlier , then my LIVEditor project ( code editor that let 's you see result of CSS/html edits in real-time ) would be even more interesting at the earlier years : ) <p> great news from a great site like CSS Zen Garden . I 've used the zen garden a lot while explaining css to others and it inspired me to do more with css . I 'm on of those who used the css zen garden to create a Mambo / Joomla template And noticed a huge overhead of html in the default Joomla output . Perhaps a new book too ? <p> This sounds like fun ! I do think more people need to learn about CSS3 and use it and that is why I did a http : **31;367;TOOLONG on CSS3 and using it in WordPress . I hope I can find time to make a submission . <p> I have a feeling I 'll be wowed just like I was the first time around with what people can do . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just allow all fonts on the zen garden domain as a kind of sponsorship ( supposing you wanted to ) . I would suggest it would be pretty great for their businesses . <p> I was introduced to CSS Zen Garden in 2007 when I first began web development . I come back at least a couple times a year , just for the nostalgia , and to remember my humble roots . I knew nothing , but was so inspired by the idea that I picked up " CSS : The Definitive Guide , 3rd Edition " from OReilly and read the 3 most important chapters of it while at the laundromat with my wife ( our washer broke that day ) . 6 years later , I 'm a software engineer , and I owe a huge portion of my inspiration to CSS Zen Garden ( and to this site called WordHugger which closed years ago ) . <p> Awesome news Dave ! CSSZenGarden was a huge learning tool for me all those years ( 10 ? ! ) ago . I 'm really glad to see its being continued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ source was a huge eye-opener to potential . Ill be keeping tabs on the project again - thank you , and here 's to another 10 years ! <p> I remember when I did n't  really believe in CSS . It looked like an unnecessary , uphill hassle . <p> A friend told me to have a look at Zen Garden . I was obstinant at first , but the designs kept me engaged and then , exploring someone elses css , the lights suddenly came on and I understood the elgance of the cascade . One of the few " aha " moments in my life that I truly remember . <p> Zen Garden taught me so much about the use of CSS when I was a beginner . I can not express enough how much I appreciated this site and how happy I am its starting over to help people learn and learn to think outside the box . Well done Zen Garden ! <p> " strolling down memory lane " sounds nice . 10 years ago we were in the second year of our web development agency and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which certainly has influenced our work ! <p> I disagree that CSS Zen Garden v1 has outlived it usefulness as teaching tool . I learned a lot from it five years ago and most , if not all , of that is still valuable . Granted things have evolved since then and an updated version will be most valuable . <p> Maybe you could add more information about how to develop your page locally , start the server and how to fork the project . Also how to name the folder for your version and what we need to do for creating a new design . <p> in looking at the CSS code , I did not realize how much " position : absolute " was used in some of the examples , but it seems to be prolific and overused. perhaps the new generation of coding entries will eliminate that questionable technique for positioning content . of course , that all depends on the HTML code layout you are presented with and need to handle . using the absolute parameter for positioning sure would not be conducive to a responsive design .

@@99593427 @3793427/ 30452 @qwx890452 30453 @qwx890453 <h> Tables ? Oh , the horror ! <p> May 15 , 2004 2PM PST <p> Apparently there remains some confusion after my Thursday-afternoon rumination on the potential use of tables , as opposed to pure CSS-based layouts . I 'm going to share some of my experience to help clear this up . <p> Some of the comments on this site were discouraging , it sounds like the original piece was interpreted to advocate laziness . Some of the replies on other sites perpetuated this interpretation , so once more , tables should be considered only with the proper education to use them responsibly . This means attention to accessibility , as well as offloading all other presentational attributes to the CSS , leaving the simplest of layout-structural tables . <p> The point I was clear to make was that I am not talking about dropping CSS and going back to 1997-era coding techniques . Standards-based coding practices are n't  so fragile that a small injection of common sense and/or objective analysis will excuse full-scale dismissal , so let 's not pretend like the world is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; chances are the people who would are doing so anyway . <p> I am suggesting merely that in some cases , it might make sense to explore a layout table . Again , I do not mean three-level-deep nested tables rife with the required colspans . I mean a light table with two or three columns to keep a layout together , sans all other presentational markup . This is what I have in mind : <p> The cellspacing remains simply because the CSS equivalent ( margin : 0 applied to &lt;td&gt;s er , that is , border-spacing is what I was looking for here thanks to those who clarified ) is n't well supported . The &lt;tr&gt; remains merely because its still required . The important piece of this table is that three columns keep the layout together , as expected . <p> Why am I saying this might be preferable over floats or absolute positioning ? First of all , the pitfall of absolute positioning is that placing a footer below the three columns is near impossible . Creating this layout using absolute positioning causes a reliance on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; given a dynamic site , if you build this reliance in to your work you 'll get bitten by it sooner or later . Pages will start looking funny when a column grows longer than intended , as the content area grows shorter . <p> Floats , then , are the more reliable way to achieve your three columns . Except that they have their own glitches too . The most popular browser on earth , IE6 , has spectacularly inconvenient error-handling in this regard . Anyone who has built more than one or two sites with floats knows what I 'm talking about : a placed element too wide for its container , be it an &lt;img&gt; or a &lt;pre&gt;-wrapped chunk of text , will cause the parent element to grow to contain it . Other browsers let the content overflow to no i 'll effect other than a bit of overlapping , but because the parent element resizes in IE , the column gets bumped all the way below the others and you have a situation no one is happy with . <p> I 'm hearing contention against the claim that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , learning the basics is n't terribly difficult . Learning the basics well so that you know how to keep the above scenarios from happening is a different matter , and requires browser-specific tricks that go against the nature of what CSS is meant for . Anyone can build a fixed-pixel layout in CSS with known font sizes , that 's easy stuff . Build me a liquid three column layout that allows for text scaling in Internet Explorer , and watch how easy it is to break by increasing your font size . Especially once the code leaves your hands . This is where it gets hard , folks . <p> Which brings me to my next point working with other team members and clients . I mentioned this on Thursday , but it bears repeating . There are many different working conditions out there which do n't  match your own . Assuming because you know how to maintain your layout integrity with CSS that everyone else can is a leap of faith , or the by-product of a cozy environment that does n't  test your endurance . <p> I 've worked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finish , and where I 've had to rely on others to continue producing valid , well-formed , structural markup . The first scenario makes it dead simple to assure a sites continued abstraction of presentation , the second does not . Even if you have the most responsive team members , you 're still limited to what they know . Like it or not , many people look at markup from a presentational standpoint , ie. " this form element needs to sit below this label , insert &lt;br /&gt; here . " Either you have to clean this up after them , or more likely , you 've moved on to other projects by this point and do n't  have the time to . <p> A little bit of presentational markup is n't going to hurt things , and probably , alone , is n't a justification for a structural table . What is is how likely the chances are that anyone not-you is going to trigger something like the IE float problem mentioned above . Anecdote : I built a site earlier this year that worked fine with my sample data . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occured . The culprit turned out to be a small piece of non-semantic markup that was used in various spots over years of accumulated content . I was not contracted to clean up the content ; the client had no desire to fix years worth of material . The seemingly easiest fix was to throw the page into a structural table . I knew a CSS hack or two to work around this , and we did n't  end up using it after all ; but would everyone ? <p> Let 's also not forget that were talking amongst people who have spent a lot of time working with this stuff , and that there are those who have n't . For a beginner transitioning to CSS-based design , a few iterations of table layouts that move more and more presentation to the CSS is one of the better ways to learn . Even once the intricacies of positioning are fully understood , it takes time to become comfortable with them . Let 's cut these folks some slack ; their continued use of a table is just fine if they 're continuing their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> And finally , let 's talk semantics . I hate discussing semantics , personal interpretations ( unavoidably ) shade the conversations . But let 's do it anyway . This is the point that 's going to get me into the most trouble because everyone is going to have a different take , but I 'm going to throw it out there . Using a table for tabular data is universally accepted as being proper use of a table . Which carries with it the assumption that the table is structural and not presentational in that case . Fair enough . <p> But if tabular data is structurally tabular , then what inherently ( besides a fear of the past ) makes a two- or three-column layout structurally non-tabular ? Two columns invariably end up in a pair of &lt;div&gt;s , or a pair of &lt;td&gt;s . What makes the former structural , but the latter any less so ? A pair of &lt;div&gt;s implies two distinct , separated blocks of structure ; a pair of &lt;td&gt;s does the same , and carries with it the further implication that the blocks are structurally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but they may be structural to others . <p> I 'm not committed to the notion , but its something to think about . There are those who would advocate multiple nested lists ( scroll down to Tanteks technique ) as a structural replacement for the &lt;div&gt;s we use today , so if there are two ways to look at semantic representation of data , there are just as easily three . <p> Anyway , at the risk of sparking a howl over the last point and ignoring what went before it , I 'll finish by saying this is based on the sum of my experiences in real-world situations . There are many factors at play here , and boiling this discussion down to " tables bad , CSS good " is counter-productive at best . <p> Ill end with the contentious quote of the day , coming from Joe Clark : <p> If smart , informed people are using b or i , its because they have made smart , informed decisions to do so . Were not slacking off ; were not making a mistake ; were not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not doing anything but using b or i . <p> Different argument , misappropriated quote , but similar sentiment . Semantics only get you so far ; at some point , you have to compromise and just use the tools you have at your disposal . 30451 @qwx890451 <p> You are reading " Tables ? Oh , the horror !

@@99593428 @3793428/ <p> I 've decided to slap a Creative Commons license on the entire darn Chalkwork Family and make them completely free for personal use , starting right now . <p> Ive been considering doing this for quite a while . These icons represent a lot of hard work for me between 2006 and 2009 , so you can imagine I 've thought through the implications of making them available for free download without a pay barrier : will people use them commercially and not pay ? Will they abuse the license terms ? Will some redistribute them elsewhere ? Will they modify them and claim them as their own ? <p> The answer to each of those questions is , inevitably , yes . Ive been on the web long enough to know that no matter what you intend to happen , someone will always find a way to do the complete opposite of that sooner or later . But you know what ? I can live with that . <p> I 'm of the opinion that DRM and increasingly consumer-hostile content protection laws are kludgy ways of protecting outdated business models @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been treating the pay barrier as a form of copy-protection all along . Which has worked well enough for my purposes , but if I 'm being honest with myself I do n't  think I really need that protection . <p> People who appreciate your work do the right thing . Just as those who download music are more inclined to buy it , my bet is that those who download these icons for personal use may one day come back and pay for commercial use . If they do n't  , were they ever likely to buy them in the first place ? I doubt it . <p> Its not all philosophy and rhetoric , I 'm genuinely curious to see what happens next with the commercial sales since they 've been on a steady decline over the years . I tried an AdWords campaign for a while , but that did n't  do much to reverse the trend . Will opening them up under a free license provide an extra boost ? Maybe , but then maybe I just killed all future sales . Hard to say . <p> Most of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the beginning , the long tail is n't proving that profitable . Sales over the years have at least paid for the time I spent creating the family so I 'm happy with the overall return , but there 's clearly not much left to lose now so I 'm willing to experiment a little . <p> Share and enjoy . <p> Note : if you 're having trouble downloading the full files , its not just you . Downloads appear to be getting cut off halfway through . Lots of data transfer is making weird things happen ; I 'm looking into it . <p> Probably a good choice considering the point you made about music . If people download these icons now that they 're free , and they find themselves considering them for a client project , they 're more likely to come back and buy a license than they were without getting them for free for personal use . <p> Regardless , thanks for making these available . I 'm not sure I 'll use them myself , but its always nice to have another set of quality icons ready to download at will . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I admire your decision as this very excellent icon set has clearly cost you a lot of work and time . <p> I agree on your position that DRM in general is becoming increasingly user-unfriendly , and am also of the view that this method of providing high-quality content for free personal use with the aim/hope that this will encourage users to pay for commercial use ( or may lead to commissions ) is the way forward for work like this . <p> That 's a really nice set of icons and glad to hear you 've made something back for all your hard work . I feel you 've made a good decision to offer them as a free download for personal use as designers will use them in mock-ups and if their clients like them , then they will include commercial use costs within the budget . Personally I tend to use online stock photo libraries and happy knowing that a percentage of each sale goes back to the designer .

@@99593430 @3793430/ <p> Take it with the usual grain of salt that should accompany any news of global browser trends , but , extrapolating out from the 2011 trend in StatCounters Global Stats Chrome appears set to surpass IE as the most-used desktop browser some time next summer . And that will finally end the 13 year domination of the market by Internet Explorer . <p> Though , I 'm a little sad that Chromes market share is also coming at the expense of Firefox . <p> I 'd rather see people switch to anything but Chrome , but if you want Google to spy on you , go for it . Chrome does n't  allow tabbing through the address bar either ( you can configure Opera to do this and FF and IE have always allowed that for good UX ) . <p> I have to agree with Duncan - FF is just getting too bloated . At least once during nearly every session there is a point where you have to wait for it to snap out of a " ( not responding ) " state . This is on Windows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some of the issue is interlocking between FF and my antivirus . This lockup always happens when a download finishes , but sometimes it just happens for the heck of it as well . <p> Funny , I 've recently migrated back to FireFox from Chrome . I think the latest version of FF is far less bloated than in the past and certainly does n't  chew up my system resources like it used to ! <p> I still have a soft spot for Opera - such blindingly fast load times , but nothing else remarkable to offer . And Safari seems to render bolder , clearer fonts than any other browser . I refuse to touch IE ( any version ) and my aversion to Chrome is based on reluctance to pass any further browsing data back to its Google overlords . <p> I will echo the comments of others here I have become tired of the super-slow load time with FF , the occasional freezing , and the occasional warning from my system that FF is using too much system memory ( on my XP desktop and my clients @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laptop ) . <p> I 'm also tired of what seem to be constant update nag screens , though I admit I go weeks before acting . And I seem to recall reading they have a new goal of updating every 6 weeks . Why do that ? I suppose its in the name of keeping up with the competition , but I really do n't  enjoy such frequent prompts to upgrade ( and the concomitant notices about all the plug-ins that wo n't work anymore ) . <p> As for Chrome , I understand its supposed to be snappy and I 've worked with some folks who are big fans , but I 'm also leery of putting all my eggs into one basket . I 'm not sure google could get all that much more information out of my browser than they already have from all of my searching , but I do know that *some* of the information they could gather is that which I do n't  want them to have ( banking , etc ) . So sad not to trust google who , once upon a time , I saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alas , that time has passed . <p> If you guys say FF7 is better , I 'll give it a try . I 've just about given up on it and have been ignoring the 7. x update screens . I keep hoping I 'll make a decision to jump ship , but cant quite bring myself to do it . So , on to the upgrade and well see if it is more promising than the version I am using ( 6. x ) . <p> Chrome also updates every 6 weeks . The difference is that they silently , secretly update without telling you . <p> The #1 reason in my book for the regular updates is that the people trying to steal your passwords and empty your bank account never sleep . <p> If you search old tech news you 'll find many examples of browser based exploits that were patched by Firefox , Safari , Opera , and Chrome days/weeks/months before Microsoft fixed IE. <p> And even more cases where the exploit only existed in IE. <p> The web does not stand still . Those dedicated to exploiting its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to keep ignore those upgrade ( nag ) screens . <p> Also the people who make the web what it is , the developers behind the websites you love and use daily have dreams of giving you an even better experience but those dreams must wait for better technology to exist in the browsers . Every browser upgrade takes us all one step closer to that next super-cool facebook feature or killer web-app . <p> I had the start-up time and freeze issue with Firefox , I solved rebuilding the Places sql file ( with the Places Maintenance extension ) . Also making a new profile and disabling unused add-ons could help . I suggest using a profile with web development extensions just when working , as some of them are really heavy . It is possible to have two Firefox windows running different profiles at the same time if you launch the application adding -no-remote command . 30455 @qwx890455 30451 @qwx890451 <p> You are reading " A New Number 1 " , an entry posted on 1 November , 2011 , to the Fox Glacier collection .

@@99593431 @3793431/ <p> I ca n't be the only one bored to tears of simple border and background colour styling for button formatting . <p> I recently worked on an application that used a common graphical button style across all pages , but did n't  offer common HTML elements to work with . Some of the buttons were clearly better implemented as a elements , whereas the rest were proper input buttons . <p> This is , of course , maddening . There 's literally no way to format an a and an input element identically across all browsers , aside from hard-wiring the text of that button into an image and using it to replace the element . That 's not exactly a viable fix on an application with dozens or hundreds of buttons . <p> I needed a middle ground . Images were necessary to pull off things like bevels and rounded corners and gradients and all those effects that make a button look like a button . But I needed HTML text to allow for easy button creation , and preferably in a way that would allow me to use both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the comments lead me to believe I was n't clear enough about what 's happening in these examples . You 'll see three sets of two buttons rendered identically side-by-side . On the left , the button is being constructed with the button element . On the right , the button is instead constructed with the a element . Same visual styling , but different markup . <p> This is just an incremental update over ground the original Particletree article has covered well , so I wo n't bother writing up a detailed explanation . Youve got the theory , and I think a quick look at the source ought to make the method fairly apparent . <p> A couple of caveats though : obviously there were concessions made in terms of extra markup for the sake of background images . And IE6/IE7 naturally do n't  want to play fair ; there 's a conditional comment that pulls in a touch-up CSS file for alignment , and it was necessary to fix the button widths to a hard pixel value . All other browsers expand and contract the buttons gracefully along with the text @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again . And Chrome was launched in between when I originally built the demo page and today as I write this , but a quick look tells me it does the right thing . <p> Interesting article . I consider a appropriate use of buttons and anchors . Another approach which heavily lacks on browser issues is the use of select-elements optical as a set of buttons . One line can float them all . ; - ) I will write an article about this in the next weeks and will show it . <p> I have avoided the button tag because of the way IE posts the form submit . I have not found a way to cleanly work with more than 1 button tag in a form without using JavaScript to make it work . I am looking forward to seeing how you implement this . <p> Dave , I 've always considered the input type= " button " to be evil as well and have since switched to the button element simply because it seems more robust and because it is easier to target with css for older @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CSS8 comes out in 2020 well have better control with styling form elements . <p> Nice examples but I thought ( and correct me if this is not the case ) that the buttons were supposed to expand and contract with text SIZE as well as length <p> The ones we use over at GCap ( and Yahoo use the same technique ) do this and can be seen at www.capitalradio.co.uk - check out the search button at the top of the page and associated CSS with FireBug - there are IE styles , until I write up a post about them you 'll just have to be creative in how you find those out : &gt; <p> Eivind - I do n't  think the sliding doors effect can be used in this instant due to IE6 ( Boo ) not allowing : hover element on anything other than the anchor point . I have been completing some updates on a site with curved corner tabbed navigation in multiple languages ( the navigation must scale with expanding text lengths ) . For modern browsers I can easily achieve the rollover state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solution is to use JavaScript . <p> In my opinion , you still have to use JavaScript to get the button to work properly , or send the right value . In IE , the value of the button is actually the innerText of the button , not the value defined in the tag . It is n't always consistent across browsers . <p> We used to think it was plausible to use the button tag , then it caused too many problems that we decided to use a/img instead , since both would require JavaScript to fix their functionality . <p> @wolf : Did you figure out how to get rid of the black border ? @Dave : Youve got a neat example of how to style buttons and anchors but it seems to me that you spent a quiet some time working on that . Ive been working on a similar solution myself without being success yet . Getting the images to line up is the hard part . I do n't  know if you noticed it but your buttons flickr back and forth between images in IE/6 and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the havoc that the text-transform property wreaks in IE6 on button styling .. <p> I was pulling my hair out on a button with a background image and perhaps it was a magical combo of previous junk-perties assigned trying to get it to work , but upon distillation of the CSS , IE6 rendered the text-transform : uppercase to act as an image replacements negative text indent Whoa . <p> I 'm surprised . Its always seemed to me that the majority of people strongly behind web standards were also the people strongly against styling native form widgets ( and scrollbars ) . <p> I think in the long run us form-stylers will come out on top . The more people use more than 1 OS and rely on web-apps more than desktop apps , the less theyll care about an app being consistent with the OS instead of consistent across browsers and platforms 30455 @qwx890455 30451 @qwx890451 <p> You are reading " Anchor Buttons " , an entry posted on 17 September , 2008 , to the Joint collection .

@@99593432 @3793432/ <p> Good news today for those of us interested in the mobile web . Nokia opened the source of their S60 browser , which is currently the browser of choice for various Nokia phones . <p> The big pay-off here is that other companies are free to take this code and build their own browsers using Nokias code base . Consider this in context : currently there are dozens and dozens of different mobile browsers , across hundreds of phones . If you thought browser-testing on the desktop was bad , you obviously havent been paying attention to mobile . <p> With a high profile open-source mobile browser like S60 , the potential now exists for other companies to base their own browsers on an S60 base , which would mean far greater consistency on the mobile web . That 's something worth getting behind , so here 's hoping the business case is there for these companies to do so . Something clearly needs to change for the mobile web to take off , and this could very well be it . <p> As an extra treat , S60 is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to expect a completely consistent testing environment between the two for obvious reasons but as the technology gets more capable of keeping up with the desktop version , I wonder whether the overlap will enable developers to knock off most major bugs on the desktop in advance , before racking up the air time <p> From what ive understood this is just a marketing trick from Nokia to open the open source communitys eyes for nokia phones . They did n't  release anything that can be used for other developers , since the changes from the safari browser are specific changes needed for the browser to function on a s60 properly ( they did n't  even release the entire sourcecode , only parts of it ) . <p> When a company they has never contributed to open source software before , releases parts of code that were derived from other open source projects in the first place , you can forgive me for being a little sceptical . <p> Ill stick with Opera Mini I think . Works a charm , much better than any other mobile browser Ive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and if you 're on about PDAs/Smartphones , I believe Opera Mobile may suit your needs better .. <p> Dave ( of comment #5 ) When a companay that has never contributed to open source software before releases code , we should welcome them and thank them , even if all they did was release the source to stuff we already have the source for . If they end up getting the cold shoulder , which you seem to be giving , then they 're just going to drop the whole idea and never release source again . If , instead , they find that the response is warmer , then maybe theyll take the risk and release some good stuff . Like my mom always said : you catch more flies with honey than with vinegar . <p> This is a step forward indeed and should help everyone get what they want . Thanks for posting this . I do n't  know what is happening to Minimo from Mozilla at the moment ? Minimo would seem to be a ready made open source mobile browser . <p> Hmm , I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does find what they did commendable . But when Nokia first announced its open source browser project last year , the company said that creating a browser based on existing open source components was the least-expensive route to offering a full-function browser on its phones . <p> And I guess this guy might be biased but <p> " It has limited value for the open source community , " said Hakon Lie , CTO for Opera . " The amount of code that Nokia released is relatively small compared to the amount it kept proprietary and the innovations Nokia has made are unlikely to be useful to developers of mobile phone platforms other than S60 . " " What I 'm seeing is they 're flirting with open source and trying to get the open source community interested in their platform , but its more of a marketing thing rather than a real technical contribution , " he said . <p> Wow , that 's great news , the mobile web has never really taken off ( especially WAP ) and it might be due to the incompatibility of layout rendering . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mobile operators do take notice of this open software initiative ( as mentioned in posts above . ) <p> I use my iPaq PDA and Sony PSP to go online sometimes and it is hard to find websites which display properly ( not that I think us designers have to rush to buy all small electronic devices to test browser compatibility ) , but it would be great if these companies could decide on a standard ( with reference to the W3C 's Mobile Web Initiative ) so us designers could add that extra capability of our users . <p> Having plowed through the Nokia documentation , it seems that none of their browsers support media type in stylesheet declarations . This means that my current home page , which only manages to show the navigation column , ca n't be fixed without javascript-based browser sniffing . Did n't  I read something about Stop hacking or be stopped somewhere ? <p> Maybe we go back to the bad old days - This site is best viewed in Opera , download Opera for your mobile here. <p> Open sourcing this is great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the newer handsets ( N80 , N91 , etc ) a very decent browsing experience . I currently use Opera Mini 2.0 which really is great , but the Nokia browser I think just pips it . By making it open source might we not see it on other platforms apart from Symbian ? <p> Although the new Opera browser for the Nintendo DS looks amazing . <p> Bruce - As far as " media declarations " go , pretty much every Nokia in the last few years that handles XHTML deals with the " Handheld " stylesheet , I do n't  see why this should be any different . <p> Mark , You are quite correct . I had been fooled by other devices that seemed to recognise the handheld style sheet but in reality reformatted the page according to their own rules . The result looked good so I figured my handheld style sheet worked . My new Nokia faithfully followed my very poor attempt at a handheld stylesheet and the result was awful . I confess I wondered if making our site handheld-friendly was just an exercise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of PR loves the fact that he can respond to media questions with info from the site on his Blackberry wherever he is . <p> I love what the Nokia has to offer but I can not find one that has the walkie talkie feature which is on my other phone a nextel . Still I find it interesting to play with and see the browser functions of Nokias . <p> I think it is a step in the right direction to reach browser consistency in the market . However , other companies have good browsers , too . I 've just read that Motorola will use the Opera browser in future and I can not believe that they will change their strategy , switch to Nokias S60 and waste a lot of money , they put in former research .

@@99593434 @3793434/ <p> One of the tools I mentioned during the talk , the $20USD Xyle scope CSS debugger and analysis tool , is something I 've been using and recommending since shortly after its release . I think its high time I got around to writing up why exactly I think its so great . <p> What I like about Xyle scope is the richness of information it provides about a pages DOM and CSS , and how easy it is to get to that information . A typical scenario that 's becoming far more common for me is that I come back into a site I last worked on a few months ago , and cant remember the specific i 'd and class values Ive used , or how specific my selectors ended up being , or increasingly , which files contain which style . <p> here 's an example of what I mean . On the front page of this site , there 's a listing of the 5 most recent posts . If I needed to get back into the CSS at some point and start changing the formatting of the dates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my memory by determining a few things : <p> What sort of HTML element the dates are contained in , and whether it has a class or i 'd <p> Parent elements , and their respective id/classes <p> Which rules in the CSS apply to that element directly <p> Which rules in the CSS that element inherits from parents <p> The specificity of any of the CSS rules <p> Which CSS files the appropriate rules exist within <p> Any time I need to make an edit to a page , I need to go through that list and figure out all the relevant information about the element in question . Though I only have a single file on this site , these days I favour breaking up a larger sites CSS into multiple files . This compounds the management problem , since it makes it a bit more difficult to narrow down on the exact rules I need . But that 's only part of the problem , the rest is the mental overhead required to work out myself how the specificity breaks down , and which rules I actually want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm getting at is that the mental energy exerted to figure out all of this is something that can and should be done by software . There 's no reason why I should n't be able to just point and click on the element and have all of that information shown to me automatically . Enter Xyle scope . <p> The prevous screenshot gives you an idea of what all that click can tell you . Up in the top right ( panel a ) , there 's a DOM drill-down that shows you the entire hierarchy up to the element you 've clicked on . Its informational , but it also acts as a DOM browser : if you need to , you can click on adjacent or parent elements and work your way back up or down the hierarchy ( and the rest of the information , as well as the selection within the browser pane on the left , will update accordingly ) . <p> Down below the DOM browser ( panel b ) , there 's a markup synopsis that outlines what the HTML elements , classes , and ids are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ applicable ) . <p> Then down at the bottom right , there 's a split-panel style rule browser . The more comprehensive listing includes selectors and fullrules on the left ( panel c ) , and the summary on the right ( panel d ) is kind of a navigation for the left that includes just the selectors . The information in the left panel is extremely useful , and gives me exactly what I outlined above . <p> What were looking at in panel c is a summary of the cascade , followed by a listing of all the style rules that could potentially apply to the date in that home page listing I picked as my example . You 'll notice some properties are greyed out ; these are properties that do n't  actually make up the final styling of the element , since they 're being overridden in other , more specific rules . At a glance I can tell exactly which selectors are applying which properties , obviating the need to sift through multiple selectors and calculating specificity manually . <p> As well , you 'll notice the word wintermint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the name of the CSS file that the selector resides in . As I have one single CSS file for the site , its not so useful in this instance . But when armed with a tool that clarifies to this level exactly which rules I should be looking at , you can see how that naturally eases any fear of maintaining multiple CSS files . Managing them is a snap with a tool like this . <p> I do n't  just use Xyle scope for debugging ; I use it for any sort of editing or CSS creation that involves thinking carefully about specificity issues . It has cut down on the time I spend fooling around in a CSS file trying to figure out exactly where to make my change , and its mastery of specificity has actually impacted the quality of my overall CSS for the better . I can write tighter , more precise style rules without the worry that I wont be able to make sense of them later . And though other software offers similar results , as I mentioned at the top , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nature over built-in browser tools . <p> No , there 's no Windows version at the moment , but Mac minis are cheap like bubble gum these days . Youve already got a Mac for testing anyway , right ? ( And nope , I 'm not getting paid for this posting or recommending the software , I 'm simply an enthusiastic user . ) <p> Good post , now I have a better idea of how Xylescope works . I had downloaded and tried this app out a few times , but never really sat down to use it extensively enough to really understand how to use it well . Thanks ! <p> Dave , your post focuses primarily on using Xyle scope to edit and debug your own website and I agree its a terrific tool for that . But another of Xyles strengths is allowing you to really get under the hood of other peoples websites as well ! Sure , I could look at a sites ( let 's say , yours ) source and look at the CSS file , but no other tool that I know of allows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a cohesive , visual manner . So not only does Xyle help with development time , it also helps us learn ! Great tool ! <p> My guess : do one thing and do it well . Why patch on a half-assed text editor when a ton of great ones exist already ? This app does what it does ; I 'm prefectly content to use it without an internal editor . <p> Great write-up , Dave ! I knew there was something to this program , but I had n't  taken the time to dig into it yet . This helps a lot . As you mentioned before , a lot of this can be done with the Firefox Web Dev Extension , but this is very clean . I 'm going to have to consider if its $20 worth of clean , though ! <p> This tool looks very nice . If I will ever manage to switch to a mac , I would definitely give it a shot . But for now I am happy with my PC workstation . I mostly use the DOM-Inspector that ships with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of course parallel to the " Web developer " - and " FireBug " -Extensions ) . <p> It gives me a tree-view of the DOM and also all the css-rules ( along with the associated css-files ) which apply to a certain element . For now I can live with that although this " Xyle scope " looks very good . Especially the specificity-indicator . That one I would really like to be able to use . = ) <p> This allows you to inspect items on a page on the fly . You put it in your favorites and click on it ( or set up a shortcut ) then it pops up a javascript window on the site you are on . It gives all kinds of information about the current site . Once you look at some of the shortcuts , it really becomes a powerful tool . Just thought I would give my two cents and yes Xyle scope is awesome as well ! <p> CSSEdit is Mac only whereas StyleMaster has the advantage of working on Windows as well as Mac OS . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ auto-complete , a live preview , a clean visual editor for those who are still learning and is much cheaper than its full featured competitor . The next CSSEdit release ( actually still beta ) also feature a XyleScope like selection mode . Not as complete as XyleScope , but it becomes really handy in a daily use . <p> ps : The main trouble I encounter with StyleMaster was a white flash on each refresh in StyleMaster , it trigger a headache in less than 10 minutes . Also they might have solved this problem by now , its been a while . <p> Dave , I saw your panel at @media and found it very informative . I 'm just getting to grips with advanced CSS ( playing catch-up , I know ) and a tool like this is an excellent way to keep yourself sane ! Shame it doenst ship for Windows as yet . <p> However , I 'm finding Dreamweaver8 ( which I use for most of my development ) has much better CSS support than previous versions , and if you click any element in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which rules apply and where they are defined . That 's pretty handy and saves a lot of head-scratching at times : - ) <p> Great post ! The app is awesome and literally saves me hours of work . Producing XHTML and CSS ( use BBEdit for that ) is one thing , but tweaking the CSS based layout on the fly is another ! Couldnt live without it .

How great would that be ? <p> Just for the record , I 'm pretty sure it is just browsers that use the Mac version of Gecko that exhibit the anti-aliasing problem . The problem occurs whenever any element is changed from opacity:1 to any other value . A less than ideal workaround is to set the body element ( or div#wrapper ) to opacity : .9999 ; in your stylesheet , which makes the " very light anti-aliasing " effect permanent so there is no annoying flash between the two " modes " . This bug has been biting me all year : ( <p> Actually it fixes the problem in all browsers . That 's because once opacity other than 1 is assigned , a different rendering mode is used . If you do JavaScript image transitions with opacity , you also need to stop at 0.999 or you 'll see that flash . <p> Also sorry if I 'm stating the obvious , but I should probably add that the " opacity : 0.99999 " trick will force Firefox and Camino @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be inconsistent with the anti-aliasing used throughout the rest of OS X ( unless you 're using Standard to begin with ) . <p> Hopefully , this is a bug that will be addressed in the next version of Gecko . <p> I tried to implement opacity ( 95% if I remember correctly ) on some dropdown menus and got some faint ghosting in Firefox ( Windows ) in the rectangular area that the menus occupy at their largest extent ( if that makes sense ) when they were in the inactive/mouseout state . I did n't  have time to experiement with it but has anyone come across this and have a solution ? <p> Alex is right , Gecko seems to be switching to standard antialiasing . But the culprit with " opacity : 0.99999 " is not Gecko . Its that the underlying graphic library of Mac OS X is unable to draw subpixel antialiasing onto a transparent background which has to be used to draw the element prior changing its opacity . And its not even the fault of the graphic library , but rather its the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does not support independent alpha channels for each of the subpixels . That 's likely to be a problem for a long time , although in clase Daves example it could probably be arranged in Gecko by not overusing off-screen image buffers to draw the page . <p> Here are some general tips to keep subpixel antialiasing working on web pages : if you specify opacity , also specify an opaque background on the same element or on the child elements containing text , or if you 're just playing on the text opacity , use a transparent text color : " color : rgba(0,0,0,0.5) " . Note that these tips only deal with the theorical limitations of rendering with aRGB , not browser bugs . <p> On a related note Be careful when using IEs special filters to get opacity in navigation elements . I tried to set the background opacity in a recent Son of Suckerfish menu nav system and spent close to 3 hours trying to figure out why the 3rd + level menus were not rendering . The initial dropdown showed fine with the transparent BG but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I came across some weird IE clipping problem but it turns out it was not the CSS at all . To make a long story short once I commented out the IE filters it all worked fine . Doh ! <p> Same goes for transparent PNGs in navigation . This past spring I had to use Cederholms Accessible Image-Tab Rollovers1 to develop the main nav in some web site templates . Sure enough , after a few hours of pulling my hair out trying to figure out why IE was chocking , it had to do with the special filters you need to use to get transparency in PNGs to work correctly . I got rid of the filters and used gifs instead . <p> So even in the revised example Gecko/Mac OS X still renders the text a bit lighter than in other browsers due to the set opacity for the image ? This is a really annoying bug because with certain backgrounds ( and text color ) the text can become almost unreadable . <p> Ville : in the revised example , the text will render with subpixel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Gecko , but only for those with subpixel antiasing turned on . For those with subpixel antialiasing turned off , the text will always be " lighter " whatever the browser . So you should never chose a color scheme that makes the text unreadable under those conditions anyway . <p> I discovered a problem with opacity today . Each time I included an opacity property the overall webpage responsiveness decreased . At first I was miffed as to what was causing the problem . But when I commented out all the opacity references , the page responsiveness reverted to normal . Any more than two references and you have problems . I was using Safari , and firefox for OSX . So I do n't  know if this is true for all browsers . <p> I 'd really like to use Opacity on my site . Is the 0.9999 workaround really fixing the problem for all browsers ? ? ? Also for IE7 ? ? ? I cant test that because I do n't  want to lose my IE6 installation . : -0 ? ! ! Thanks !

That 's not a question I 'd ever have thought to ask , but this evening I found an answer after following the most fascinating click trail in , well , ever . <p> It started with an idle perusal of recent Flickr photos from my contacts . Jeremy Keith is currently in Chicago for DrupalCon , and after a page of tantalizing food and architectural photos , I found myself back in Brighton looking at his photos from a laboratory-related exhibit at the Lighthouse Gallery . <p> I 'm quite familiar with the word because Dr. Gordon Tener my grandmothers brother and a father figure to my own dad had a long career as a professor of biochemistry at the University of British Columbia here in Vancouver . During his tenure he researched , among other things , ribonucleic acid ( RNA ) and the genetic organization of drosophila melanogaster , otherwise known as the common fruit fly . <p> Dr. Tener died two years ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ realized that I may never have punched his name into Google to see what the internet knew about his life and achievements . So I did , and eventually I stumbled across a Blogger site set up to document the extended family history of the Tener family . <p> The top of the site references something called the Tener Book , which was a genealogy published in the fifties that I 'd never heard of . And what do you know , there on page 79 are references to Dr. Tener and my grandmother , which means this book is about my family history , back 20 generations through nine centuries and five countries , complete with photos of various great-great-great-great grand-relatives and a family crest I did n't  know about . <p> All from a photo of a fruit fly breeding chamber . <p> Its easy to take for granted just how much information we have at our fingertips these days , but then mind-blowingly personal discoveries like this come along every now and then and put it all in sharp focus . The internet is amazing . <p> I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just a few weeks ago . I gave the lady at the desk my name . She asked if I was descended from Jesse DeForest of France . I excitedly replied yes . She informed me that she was also his descendant . We made arrangements to meet after my Temple session .

She pointed me to a book titled , " A Walloon Family in America " which contains an account of Jesse and his family through a different line . I could n't believe I was sitting and reading a book about my own family . I was absolutely mesmerized ! <p> If you want to learn more about your family , a great place to research is at https : //www.familysearch.org/ - tons of resources there . Happy hunting !

@@99593441 @3793441/ <p> It occurs to me that I should finally mention here a project Ive been working on over the past month or so . Much to my surprise , what started out as a simple foray into the canvas elements pixel manipulation APIs quickly evolved into a full-fledged Javascript library called PaintbrushJS . <p> Its basically a set of image filters that render in the browser . Greyscale , sharpening gaussian blur and more on the web , no ImageMagick or GD required . It allows you to take an image like this : <p> And using a simple class and a couple of HTML5 data-* attributes , render it in a number of different ways : <p> I skipped the jQuery and went full Javascript on this one , but it ought to play nice alongside most other Javascript libraries out there . More on how to use it , and there 's a real-time demo page you can play around with . ( works best in Safari and Chrome , thanks to their speedy Javascript engines and support for the HTML5 range form input ) <p> Since I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and lower from the equation ( it works great in the IE9 beta ) , which meant that I could also save out the images as dataURLs . The upshot ? You can use the output images the same way you would any other image within a web page ; as a CSS background , as source for a canvas animation , and if you really want , you can even Right Click -&gt; Save As to save the filtered image to your hard drive . <p> ( And this blog template is really starting to show its age . In a fit of irony worthy of an entire extra verse by Alanis , I had to pre-render the effects above and save them as separate images instead of showing them rendering realtime , because the HTML5-friendly PaintbrushJS does n't  play nice with an XHTML doctype . ) <p> Images are working fine from Google Reader for me , so maybe its already been fixed . = ) <p> The demo is great . I 've played around with it in Firefox and Chrome , and the sliders are definitely a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when you set the slider to a different value , the original image flashes before the newly filtered image replaces it . That did n't  happen on Firefox when I was setting values via text . <p> Do any of you know if its possible to copy an arbitrary element to the canvas ? e.g. , let 's say I have a div with three different images , some borders , a background color , more child elements , etc. and I wanted to copy that entire div to the canvas , then apply a transform . A friend wants a gaussian blur effect over a div like that which has elements that are scrolling sideways . If it was possible to copy an arbitrary element to the canvas and modify PaintbrushJS to use web workers and/or WebGL calls , it might just be fast enough to do in real-time . As far as I can tell , currently you can only insert images and other canvas elements into the canvas element , but maybe a few years from now this would be possible ! For now , shell probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and making a ( or several ) large , pre-blurred image that scrolls by . Eww . <p> It looks like the scenario in my previous comment is possible in Firefox with their drawWindow extension to the canvas element ; however , its only allowed for code running with Chrome privileges ( e.g. extensions ) because of several potential security vulnerabilities : <p> This is really cool . The added effects are really nice and excellent news that it also works in IE9 . I do not blame you for excluding IE8 and lower as am not sure how this would function in the dated IE browsers with all the problems they cause . Cool that you can also save the images to data URLs also . <p> This is really slick , Dave . And I already have a feature request ! For the Color Tint filter , would it be possible to add the option to multiply the tint color on top of the image ( a la a Color Overlay layer effect with Multiply blend mode in Photoshop ) ? I 'll confess I have a specific usage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a good addition in general .

@@99593443 @3793443/ <h> Elevation <p> Elevation is a free , open source route visualizer that renders personal GPS data in 3D space , built in Processing by Dave Shea . <h> How Do I Use Elevation ? <p> You 'll need to have a GPS-equipped phone or device capable of tracking your activity as you run , hike , cycle , skate , ski , snowboard , or whatever other physical activity you choose to map . You 'll also need the ability to export that data as XML , in either GPX , TCX , or KML format . ( If you have files in just about any another format , you can probably use GPSBabel to convert them to GPX files and get them working with Elevation . ) <p> Download the version for your operating system and open the zip file . Inside you 'll find a folder called data . Open this data folder , and open the xml folder inside of it . There you 'll see some example data called ExampleRoute05.gpx and so on that comes with the application ; you can safely delete these example files and replace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ files , restart Elevation . To move the map around , use the controls below . To rotate the view , click and drag within the viewport . To move faster , hold down the shift key as you press the buttons . <h> Screenshots <h> FAQ <p> What are the four View Modes ? <p> There are four buttons to toggle different data rendering modes . Mode 1 renders plain dots at each GPS point . Mode 2 renders each GPS point as a colour-coded dot that indicates its elevation : red are the highest points , blue are the lowest . Mode 3 renders colour-coded dots that indicate your relative speed : blue is the slowest , and red is the fastest . Mode 4 renders animated tracers that follow each individual path . <p> You can check the " Connectors " box to optionally connect each point with a line . <p> Why does n't  View Mode 3 work ? <p> The colour-coded speed indicators do n't  work at all with the KML format . This is a limitation in the file format itself ; since there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't  have enough data to calculate the speed . If you have the option , use the GPX or TCX file formats instead . <p> Does View Mode 4 show velocity ? <p> Not at the moment . The blue dots currently trace a simple path across each route at a speed of one GPS point per frame . This does n't  represent real world velocity in any way , but perhaps a future version will . <p> How accurate is the scale ? <p> Pretty darn accurate . The maps are projected in Mercator , which is known for distorting the landforms the further away from the equator you get . Elevation compensates for this distortion so the values should be close to reality . However , due to 3D perspective distortion you should only rely on the scale when in 2D mode . <p> One scenario that might not work so well is if you 're viewing long routes that stretch hundreds of kilometers or more from north to south . The scale is averaged to the middle of those routes , so the top and bottom edges may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to show miles instead ? <p> No , and this is n't really a priority ; GPS works in metric , I think in metric , so adding the conversion is n't high on the to-do list . <p> For now , divide the kilometer value by 1.6 to manually convert to miles if you need to . ( ie. 10km = 6.2mi ) <p> Why isnt the elevation data more accurate ? <p> Elevation is purposely shown at an exaggerated scale compared to latitude and longitude . It turns out that an accurate elevation scale is really boring to look at in most cases . If you really want to see the accurate view , hit Shift + 6 ( ) . Told you . <p> Additionally , you may find that that for some of your routes the elevation visualization seems off in places . Maybe by a little , maybe by a lot . This is likely a result of bad data from your GPS device . <p> Unfortunately commercial GPS is n't terribly precise , especially when the device does n't  have a clear line of sight to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ device in your pocket or tracing routes through heavy forests or dense highrises , you might find the results are wildly inaccurate . To improve the accuracy of your routes consider an armband holder , a bike mount , or some other way of keeping the device outside your clothing . <p> How do I improve performance ? <p> While Elevation is robust and can handle many thousands of GPS points , there are certainly limits . If you find the display is bogging down and moving to be painfully slow try removing a few XML files from routes you know to be duplicates of others you 've travelled . <p> Also if you 're inclined to travel massively large routes , ie. hundreds of kilometers at a time , I salute you . But you may also wish to limit the number of those you try to render at the same time . If your XML files are more than half a meg , do n't  throw dozens into Elevation at once . <p> Are there keyboard shortcuts for movement ? <p> Yes . The arrow keys move the map around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in . Hold down Shift to increase the speed of keyboard movement . <p> Why is the Windows download so much larger than the Mac OS X download ? <p> Elevation relies on Java . OS X typically has Java pre-installed , whereas Windows does n't  so the necessary libraries to run it are included . If you 're sure you have Java installed already you can grab this 1.9MB Windows version instead . <p> What about a Linux binary ? <p> For now Linux is a DIY proposition ; go grab the source and a copy of Processing and build your own binary . <h> Compatibility <p> Elevation knows how to work with XML files in the GPX , TCX and KML formats . <p> Due to inconsistent file structures and limited parsing options in Processing , it may not work with every file in those formats . Support likely depends on the tool used to create them ; so far Elevation has been tested with those from the iPhone app RunKeeper Pro , Garmins Training Center / Connect and GPSMap , Nokias Sports Tracker , and files converted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just about any another format , you can probably use GPSBabel to convert them to GPX files and get them working with Elevation .

@@99593444 @3793444/ <h> GPS to Mercator Projection <p> A geography issue Ive been struggling with over the past little while is correcting my assumptions about how latitude / longitude coordinates work . When I originally built Elevation I decided to take a shortcut and ignore Earth curvature , treating my GPS points as a Cartesian grid . <p> And it worked , sort of . It gave me land forms that come close to representing the actual terrain . In hindsight its pretty obvious how distorted they were , but for the first few iterations of the program they were good enough . <p> I 've now started looking into representing paths with more accuracy . At the moment Elevations speed scale is totally relative to the data , but I 'd like to peg actual km/h values to it . I 'd also like to indicate the scale of the map with sliding meter/kilometer markers that adjust based on zoom level . As I started going down this road I quickly realized the math needed a closer look . <p> Without a clue where to begin , I turned to Wikipedia and various @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a clue about converting my GPS coordinates into a proper grid . Long story short , what I needed was a map projection system . <p> Mercator is probably the most familiar projection out there , and its the same one Google , Yahoo , Microsoft etc. use for their online mapping services . While it seriously distorts extreme high and low latitudes ( Greenland is n't really the same size as Africa , after all ) , it has the advantage of treating smaller local areas more uniformly . Mercator wont work at the North Pole or in the Antarctic , but at a regional level like city or state/province its a fairly uniform distortion so the maps just look right ; since Elevation is intended for those smaller areas , that 's perfect for my needs . <p> So , how does one go about converting GPS lat/long coordinates to actual meters ? That 's where the math comes in , and Wikipedia handily lists a few formulas for it . Processing does n't  have sinh , cosh , or sec functions , so only the first two functions for y @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ = ++ - ++o y = 0.5 * ln * ( ( 1 + sin(-) ) / ( 1 - sin(-) ) ) <p> The x value basically ends up being your raw longitude coordinate , though its handy to offset it from the central x axis of your map . The y value requires a bit more heavy lifting . In Processing , the above functions end up looking something like this : <p> While Wikipedia does n't  explicitly say anything about radians , I found it necessary to convert y before the math would work in Processing , then convert the result back to degrees . <p> The resulting values still do n't  represent real units on the surface of the globe ; to get that you have to multiply each by the degree length , a variable value that corresponds to the surface distance between a single degree change in latitude . At the equator there are approximately 111km between degrees , but this number shrinks the closer you get to the poles . <p> Solving this problem is something I 'm currently working on . An unfortunate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be almost exactly 1.6 times less than the value at the equator , which looked for all the world like a flubbed imperial/metric conversion . If I were to start with the equator distance and divide by 1.6 : <p> x = ( adjustedPhi * 111319.9 ) / 1.6 ; y = ( lambda * 111319.9 ) / 1.6 ; <p> I would get values that look fairly darn close to accurate in Vancouver . I thought that had solved it , but I now suspect the math at different latitudes is still very much wrong . Ill update this post once I know more . <p> Update : Thanks Microsoft , for publishing this piece on MSDN about how your Bing Maps tile system works . This bit in particular seems like it contains what I 'm looking for : <p> The ground resolution indicates the distance on the ground that 's represented by a single pixel in the map . For example , at a ground resolution of 10 meters/pixel , each pixel represents a ground distance of 10 meters . The ground resolution varies depending on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ measured . Using an earth radius of 6378137 meters , the ground resolution ( in meters per pixel ) can be calculated as : <p> The map scale indicates the ratio between map distance and ground distance , when measured in the same units . For instance , at a map scale of 1 : 100,000 , each inch on the map represents a ground distance of 100,000 inches . Like the ground resolution , the map scale varies with the level of detail and the latitude of measurement . It can be calculated from the ground resolution as follows , given the screen resolution in dots per inch , typically 96 dpi :

I also remember the GUI being a confusing pile of hurt , and the process being anything but transparent . <p> Essentially , you need to point WEFT at the page you 're trying to embed the fonts in , so a ) it can create domain-specific hooks and only run on that site ( good luck getting the EOT working locally or on a staging server ) , and b ) so it can subset the character set to only the glyphs you 're actually using . The former is an overly-restrictive attempt at DRM . The latter is actually useful for controlling file sizes , aside from the total lack of manual control . <p> Microsoft mentions on the download page that some people report it working in virtualized Windows under OS X , and I have heard independent reports of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not the only one in the not-working camp . I guess if you get it working , consider yourself lucky in a pyrrhic sort of way . <p> But anyway , forget WEFT . Microsoft has clearly long given up on it . Abandonware is n't going to solve todays modern web design problems , what else have we got ? <p> At this point I 'm going to cut a very long story short and say that , despite being fairly comfortable hacking around a Terminal window and installing remote packages and the like , I wasted almost a day doing this with nothing to show for it . I suspect there 's nothing wrong with Edwards methods , but some OTF files seem to complicate things in a way it simply does n't  account for . Others reportedly work ; the ones I tried did n't  . <p> ( As an aside : there are a few web-based tools out there that do similar without the command line hackery . TTF 2 EOT does what its name suggests , and there 's a tool called Online Font Converter that supposedly converts OTF @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not linking to that one because I 'm a little suspicious of the site ( AdSense-heavy , and the zip files it produced would n't open for me ) , but if you really want to find it just search for the capitalized title in the last sentence . But you 're probably better of using FontSquirrel anyway , mentioned below . ) <p> ( As a second aside , you might be luckier than I was . You might be able to use any of these tools to go from OTF to EOT and wonder what in the world I 'm talking about . Given that I 'm definitely not the only one who had this problem , it seems likely that sooner or later you might run into a font that just does n't  want to convert . When that happens , keep reading . ) <p> After spending that time hacking around in the Terminal I was ready to give up on the entire process of WEFT-less EOT files , and then Jonathan Snook happened to mention he had a method . A bit of dialogue resulted in my prodding him into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important bit here , the part that I could n't get right before , is the manual adjustment in FontForge . The automated tools mentioned above in the OTF EOT conversion chain do n't  account for the namerecord tweaking that seems essential to get an EOT rendering in Internet Explorer . I had previously installed a tool that converted TTF files into XML so I could pull off the namerecord change in text . No such luck . FontForges awful XWindows GUI tool was the only thing that worked for me . No really , its ugly ; the UI is even worse than WEFT . But it happens to work , which is its saving grace . <p> Figure : FontForge in all its glory . <p> Also , between the time I started writing this post and now , FontSquirrel released a @font-face generator that appears to automate the whole process . I havent had a chance to test yet , so its unclear to me whether it fixes the namerecord problems or not . If so , great , but one reason to still consider using FontForge is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to drop Greek characters , accents and diacritics , ligatures , and other glyphs that are n't  typically used on an English-speaking site is handy when you have 100k+ OTF files that youd like to embed . <p> Thanks for the mention . Yes , the Font Squirrel @font-face Generator LONG ... does take care of the name issues but I am still working on it , as fontforge is choking on the really large fonts like DejaVu Sans ( 5000+ glyphs ! ) . The subsetting feature is mildly simplistic , but fairly intuitive . Any feedback is always appreciated . <p> thanks for this article , I 've been struggling with this all for a while . Goodbye WEFT and hello Font Squirrels generator ! I just used it with great success . Finally Ive got beautiful fonts throughout my site . <p> I tried WEFT on XP Pro some months ago and encountered the same problems as you did . How to force MS to finally do the job and give us a working ( ! ) solution ? Certainly not by still fussing around with the 2003 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ site ) WEFT program . I remember back in the late 90s I had to create font-files for Netscape using the sofware from Bitstream and for IE with WEFT - it was an absolute pain in the ass . <p> Right now I think for Webdesigners its best to stick with Cufon or Typeface . I must have cases the following @font-face implementation method ( including eot files ) should work : <p> @font-face font-family : Font Name ; src : url(fontname.eot) ; src : local ( Font Name Regular ) , local ( Graublau Web ) , url(fontname.otf) format(opentype) ; There are a few web sites which offer eot files or eot conversion . However , I think its best to avoid it whenever possible . We should n't support the ways of Microsoft . 
@@99593448 @3793448/ <p> Molly was a new addition to last years similar lineup , and started things nicely with a foundation talk about the basics of structure and semantics , and how that sets the stage for our Hi Fi stylin . <p> Dan continued with a look at what he calls " Bulletproof CSS " , which consists of making sure your design continues to work under circumstances like missing images , missing CSS , and different font sizes . <p> My own portion of the presentation was a look at how CSS fits into the typical designers workflow . Things like the disparity between code and GUI , browser bugs , and a few final pointers for design concepts to further study . <p> Doug then examined the technique he never got around to presenting at last years SxSW , and concluded with a story from the Wired News redesign feedback a few years ago . <p> What was particularly interesting about the panel this year was what happened despite the lack of collaboration ahead of time . With only basic outlines of what each other was planning on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in all of our presentations . <p> Now , for what those of you who were there are likely hoping I 'd get to the slides I used . I need to load this link with a couple of disclaimers . The presentation was built for a controlled environment , so instead of tailoring it for the general web audience , it is much more effective within that controlled environment . The download is large because the files are large . It may be slow because its meant to run on my computer . It wo n't render in anything but top-notch browsers . Its meant to be contained within a 1024x768 window , no shorter or wider . Its too slow in Firefox on a Powerbook , it had to be presented in Safari . ( This may not hold true for a Pentium 4 , but I have no way of knowing ) . <p> So , with that out of the way , here it is . There 's also a 1.3MB ZIP file of the entire thing . Please link to this article , instead of directly to either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the context of the disclaimers before viewing in any old web browser. ( not to mention the bandwidth issue ) . <p> To move back and forth between slides , use Accesskeys z and x . Or , move the mouse down toward the bottom of the center of the window for a pop-up menu . I 'll let you figure out what 's going on there , the source tells all . I just want to send a big thanks to Jeremy Keith for building the initial script that I modified to pull this one together . <p> The second panel , " Web Design 2010 " , was more of a group conversation than a presentation . John Allsopp played the role of power moderator ( eschewing the puny on-stage mics for a wireless that let him get down and gesticulate at the same level as the audience , demonstrating what Doug and Joe and I knew from our experience at WE04 : he s one of the most entertaining speakers in the industry ) . The rest of the panel consisted of myself , Jon Hicks , Eris Free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ six questions , discussing amongst ourselves and the audience ( and disagreeing with each other quite often too ) . Our pre-discussion for this panel was largely conducted on a WordPress weblog I set up for the purpose , which was opened to the audience for questions and is now open to everyone for reading and continued discussion . ( The URI is now permanent , so link away ) . <p> In all , the two panels I participated in were just the tiniest slice of a fraction of the entire event . It was that good . Maybe I 'll get a chance to write up the rest of the event . Maybe . <p> I saw both panels you were in , and I enjoyed them both . Web Design 2010 was one of my favorites of the whole conference . You guys did a great job , and it was nice to finally put a face with the website : ) <p> " As you said , graphic designers think visually while CSS is a language . " <p> True , but this exposes the difference between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visually but can translate their thoughts into code . Graphic designers want software to do it for them . <p> JD , I believe adobe imageready cs already does something very similar to what you describe . I think the main problem is that I do n't  think it is " semantic " as such . You still end up with a website which is essentially just a sliced up image . <p> A good CSS gui design tool would need to take a drastically different approach to truly be successful , I think . <p> As you said , graphic designers think visually while CSS is a language . How about Macromedia expanding Fireworks so that once you design a layout in Fireworks , it will generate valid XHTML document using CSS for layout ? And the generated CSS will take care of including all the appropriate hacks for different browsers ? To specify layout , you first create slices like you normally do , and then you assign slices as various divs ( and other semantic elements ) and Fireworks does the rest . It is difficult but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with all layout but even if it success rate for creating layout is 70% it will be great . What do you think ? <p> I am curious what you had to say about design being a visual process and CSS a language and how it fits within the web design model of seperating presentation , content , and structure . <p> I am a graduate student teaching web design and I am faced with this very issue . How do you teach graphic designers web design ? I cant teach them to design with CSS because its not a visual design enviornment and WYSIWYG editors do not render CSS layouts correctly . So I will have to teach them to layout with tables and use visual properties that add presentation to their documents . <p> Its good to see these issues being address . Discussion of these models and concepts seem to be taboo within some web design circles , namely the css-discuss mailing list by Eric Meyers , where any discussion other than how to technically achieve results is prohibited . So its refreshing to see designers talking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no way I could get to SXSW , this brings a few pieces that much closer . To JD : The problem with a graphic tool generating markup is that it will generate the markup within the context of the graphic . This means that in the end , the final product will remain an image ( and subject to the constraints of the image ) . <p> Perhaps some day , you can associate an XHTML document with an image , mark DIV areas ( and associate them ) and let it generate makrup based on this information . Of course , if such an application already did this , I think we would be seeing a lot more XHTML/CSS in the world . 
@@99593449 @3793449/ 30452 @qwx890452 30453 @qwx890453 <h> CMYK ( for Those Who Do RGB ) <p> February 11 , 2005 11AM PST <p> Whether you just quit your job to pursue your dreams , or you 've simply had a request from a long-time client , sooner or later you 're going to have to design a set of business cards or letterheads or something else that ultimately forces a trip to the printing press . <p> Since web geeks think in pixels and RGB , its a daunting new world to head into unequipped . Over the years across quite a few print jobs by now , I 've had to learn by trial and error . As someone used to thinking in RGB , I 've looked high and low for a good resource to turn to for help in converting that knowledge to CMYK . This may not be that resource , but I figure I 've amassed at least the beginnings of a how-to on the subject . Consider it non-authoritative , but hopefully useful . Most of the knowledge contained within applies to Photoshop , mainly because I 've had the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the basics . For anyone who has n't  owned a printer in the past decade , CMYK , or Cyan Magenta Yellow Black , refers to the colour of inks used in the printing process . CMYK inks combine in proportions to form solid colours ; Yellow and Magenta with a bit of Black form a dark maroon , for example . But there are some major differences between the RGB colour model your computer display uses and the CMYK process many printing presses use , and that 's where the first point of confusion often comes in . <p> Rule Number One , above all else in print , is that what you see on paper will not look like what you have on screen . With tweaking it may be possible to bring the two closer in line , but suffice it to say that when first printing out your work there 's a very good chance you 'll find yourself horrified at the outcome . Never trust what you see on screen . <p> CMYK is n't the final word in ink choice , it just happens to be fairly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ choice is spot colour . No one says you have to print full colour , and thus use four inks . Effective business cards often use two or three , and the reason is simple : it can be quite a bit cheaper . But pulling out any of the three from the CMYK combination will produce ugly results , so spot makes use of solid coloured inks that span a wide range outside of what your standard CMYK combination is capable of . And specialized spot colours like metallic and neon shades are possible as well . <p> Of course , you can use more than four spot colours , and potentially combine spot and CMYK in the same printing , but once you start ranging into complicated print jobs the labour involved in producing them and thus your final cost quickly increases . <p> To further complicate things , CMYK can be printed digitally or on an offset press . The latter is a traditional printing press that requires a plate to be created for each colour of ink that prints . For CMYK , that means each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plate and printed individually . As you might imagine , printing this way is more expensive due to the labour involved in creating the four plates , or separations as they 're known . A digital press , on the other hand , is more or less simply a colour laser printer . It may be a touch more expensive than your garden-variety office colour laser , but the output is pretty much the same . Printing digitally is generally cheaper . <h> Colour Management <p> Alright , next up once you 've chosen your inks , how in the world do you work with the colours on an RGB screen ? This is where I 've been stuck for years , and I 'm still not sure I have a solid handle on it , but its worth passing on what I know ( and following the comments on this article for advice from those who know better ) . <p> Note : if you have n't mastered the curves , levels , and channels of Photoshop , nows the time to brush up because you 're going to need them ( the linked articles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; they barely scratch the surface , you 'll want to keep digging ) . <p> First of all , we 've established that an on-screen colour will not look the same printed . Again , there are major differences between RGB and CMYK , or more specifically , light-based colour and ink-based colour , that prevent this from ever being possible . <p> Colour management is a deep and complex science , and the best coping strategy I 've found so far is to try and work around it . Pantone , which you have probably heard of , is one of a number of colour-matching systems that basically gives you a palette of numbered , pre-printed swatches to choose from that accurately represent the final colour . <p> The advantage is that if you use that exact Pantone number , on that exact paper , you know exactly what you 're going to get . It wont look the same on-screen of course , and your software has to support it ( in Photoshop for example , when you have the colour picker dialogue open , hit the Custom button to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . <p> The disadvantage is that you wont likely have your own set of printed swatches . An official set is pricey a few hundred local currency for what is essentially a chunk of ink samples . You can pick up cheaper books off the shelf of your local art book store that are more approximations than accurate matches . Ideally though , your print shop will have a set on hand . If you 're able to make a trip first to go pick your palette ahead of time , you can save a lot of effort later . <h> Working With Process/CMYK <p> Colour matching systems work best in conjunction with flat colour and pre-defined gradients , so the text and vector output from Illustrator or InDesign , for example , is a great use case . But what if you 're working with heavily photographic material and do n't  have that luxury ? Start throwing in overlays and other forms of colour variance , and you 're going to quickly run into problems that Pantone wo n't help . Without having direct access to the final output device , you 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep costs down ( and avoid going back and forth to proof them ) so you need to know ahead of time what you 're up against . <p> If you 're printing digitally , fortunately proofing is relatively simple you have a colour printer , right ? Inkjet or otherwise , these days you do n't  even need a high-quality printer . A $50 special at the local hardware store is more than enough . The trick is that you 're not looking for high-end , ultra-accurate results ; you 're looking for a rough approximation to see how much the colour is going to shift on you . <p> What I do is build my file in RGB from start to finish , and just before Im about to print , I save a copy of the file and convert it to CMYK , then print that . If its a first shot , the proof will come out shockingly ugly and muddy , which means I 'm on the right track . Again , this is just a rough approximation of the final colour , but it will give you a good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alternatively , Photoshop has a Proof Colors setting ( Ctrl + Y or Cmd + Y ) which can apply the current CMYK profile and soft proof what it will look like on paper , but it generally wont shift as much as an actual print will . <p> Now this is where the fun starts . How do you take that horrible output and get it to match the prefect vision you have in mind ( and just finished creating on-screen ) ? Adjustments , and lots of them . You can either go back to the RGB original and adjust elements there , knowing what you now know about the final output , or you can work directly on a CMYK copy . <p> What do you adjust ? It depends on the output . If your blues are blowing out to a bright ugly green , it might be wise to back off the yellow and boost the black . If your reds are too grey , its worth toning down the black and bump up the magenta . How do you adjust ? Again , this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going back to the RGB file and lightening everything globally to tone down the black . For major 4-colour corrections its often worth it to flatten and save a copy of the file , converted to CMYK ( Image -&gt; Mode -&gt; CMYK Color ) , and then apply curves or levels to each of the individual ink channels . I prefer levels for most operations , but more print-aware people will probably steer you to curves . Some selective masking to adjust the more problematic areas is often required as well . <p> Placing some superfluous bars of colour in the margins before you print can help cut down on the colour checks . If you know ahead of time which colours will be problematic , you can provide a range of tonal variations , mixing in varying proportions of ink . After a test run , assuming you 're in the right ballpark , you simply choose a better colour from the test strip and be done with it . Doing this cuts down on the printer runs trying to nail down the precise shade . <p> At some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the print shop , to see how far off you were and to have a reference for further adjustment , if necessary . Printing digitally , this is n't much of a problem they do n't  need to do much more than drop your file into their template and send it through the printer . Expect to have to come back later to view the result though , since they wont drop everything to get your proof done . <p> Printing offset on the other hand , is a bit different . Unless you have the ability to create separations yourself , which you probably shouldnt be doing anyway , the print shop will need to spend a bit more energy outputting those and running a proof . As far as Im aware , the machine needs to be fully inked to print them too , so at this point the proof is what you 're going to get , barring any unforeseen disasters . Its costlier to back out and make corrections at this point , although still possible . <p> Now , assuming your inkjet printer proved up to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what you were expecting , you should be ready to give the go-ahead at this stage . If you 're still not satisfied , you 'll have a guide to compare against the proofs you created earlier . Youll be able to pick up spots that have changed dramatically between the two proofs , and assuming you can tell why theyve shifted ( basic colour theory applies here yellow and cyan make green , red and yellow make orange , anything and black makes dingy brown or purple ) you can adjust to suit . There 's a certain amount of guesswork still , but armed with your set of proofs you have an effective tool for comparison , which you can use to squash all but the subtlest of colour shifts . <h> Working With Spot <p> Let 's say you 've decided to use spot colour , you 've picked your Pantones , and now you 're ready to design . What next ? Now you have to start thinking in limited colours , and your software is going to play a big role ; nothing you know about CMYK translates to spot . My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a relatively easy method of pulling off spot in each . <p> In Illustrator , create new swatches for your custom colours by clicking on the arrow in the swatch palette and hitting New Swatch . In the options menu , choose Spot as your colour type and adjust the sliders to approximate your colour choice . Repeat for each ink , and you now have a set of spot colours to work with . Use them as solids , adjust their opacity , or mix them together in gradients ; as long as you stick to this set , your Illustrator artwork will be set up properly for the print job . Technically they do n't  even have to be the same colour as your final output either . Because each separation is printed as a greyscale version of the colour channel , its unaware of any actual hue ; the Pantone you choose is what actually gets printed , not the on-screen preview . <p> Working with spot in Photoshop is a bit less straightforward . Essentially , you need to think of each ink channel as its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with that . Layers are out , for example , which also makes text uneditable ; building a file this way is tedious at best . <p> First , to understand how Photoshop works with spot . Open a photograph and convert it to CMYK ( Image -&gt; Mode -&gt; CMYK Color ) , then go into the channels palette and drag one of the channels to the trash can at the bottom of the palette . Instant spot ! You can view each individual channel in greyscale by making sure its the only one with the little visible eye icon next to it , or view them all as a blended preview of what they look like combined by enabling all eye icons . <p> Given your subject matter though , its probably none too attractive at this point . You 'll want to adjust the ink colours , which you can do by double-clicking on any channel ( the Solidity option is for your monitor only , it wont affect the printed output ) . If you create a new channel while working in spot mode , it defaults @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a spot channel by again double clicking , and selecting the appropriate radio button . Or just hit the arrow at the top of the Channels palette and create a New Spot Channel . <p> Now what you 'll want to do is devise a strategy to build up each of your ink channels . Rather than working on a composite whole and selecting colours for each new item , you mix your colours by adjusting the ink proportions in various channels . Darker means more ink , lighter means less . <p> Its a completely different way of interacting with Photoshop . Aside from layers , many of the usual tools are available to you when working in spot mode , and if you 've spent time developing advanced masking skills you can adapt that knowledge and feel right at home . Otherwise , the least elegant way to work but perhaps easiest to manipulate is to build a set of greyscale files , one for each ink channel . Layers and editable text are usuable , but any areas that require more than one colour would need to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You lose the ability to preview the combined channels though ; the only way to get that back is to save a flattened copy of each greyscale file , then combine each in a new spot file , one channel at a time . Tedious ! <p> Proofing spot colour is actually fairly simple ; you know which Pantone colours you 've chosen , so you can roughly match those in Illustrators colour picker . Make sure to print a test strip of your swatch to make sure you 're getting an accurate picture of the shift between the solid colours on screen and those on paper . Proofing in Photoshop is usually slightly more difficult due to the relative complexity of the subject matter compared to what you might be proofing in Illustrator , but the same process applies make sure to print test swatches , keep your Pantones firmly in mind , and all but the most subtle of blends should be predictable . <h> Monitor Profiles <p> Finally , I 'd be remiss to point out that there are advanced colour matching systems ( both hardware and software ) which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between screen and printer . Should you care ? Probably not they may save time for those spending a large part of their day thinking in CMYK , but for simple jobs where the basic concept of working with CMYK causes enough doubt to spur this article , its likely they 're overkill . <p> One thing that might be relevant though is the Monitor Profile your software uses . For general RGB work its best to turn off colour management ; for printed work , the software needs to somehow interpret CMYK on-screen . There are colour profiles for different types of paper which depend on your geographical region ; North America uses SWOP , for example . <p> Aside from accuracy in CMYK mode , the most useful function of having an accurate CMYK profile is the out-of-gamut warning you can pull up in Photoshop when working in RGB mode . By hitting Ctrl + Shift + Y or Cmd + Shift + Y to toggle on and off the warning , you get a layer of grey indicating spots in the file that are out of the CMYK @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by knowing these areas in advance , you have a map of which areas in your image need the most coddling , and much of your colour management issues obviate . 
@@99593450 @3793450/ <p> Digital Web is running a big triple-issue today , with a book review and author interviews . <p> Yes , I will try to keep these at a minimum since I 'm well aware its tedious to read someone elses excitement about their new pet project but its the first review and there are some things to respond to , so hopefully you can afford a little slack just this once . <p> Some things that jumped out at me from the review that might stand for a bit of extra authors interpretation : <p> The book is all about the designs on the CSS Zen Garden but not just about how different designers faced the Zen Garden challenge . It also uses the designs to take readers on a tour of everything they need to know about using CSS on a Web site . Because the HTML file stays the same , it 's easy to really zero in on the CSS and how it 's used . <p> Well , not quite everything you need to know about using CSS . No bones about it , this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away some of the basic lessons ( there is not a single box model illustration to be found , for example ) in order to skip to advanced design and integration techniques . Its about using CSS for design , not learning CSS . <p> I often get contacted for CSS design work , from which I begin a lengthy process of explaining that yes , I know CSS syntax , but CSS is n't really the point of it ; the design is more important . Perhaps I 'm just funny about making the distinction and it does n't  really matter , but I suppose I just suspect the CSS = design mindset leads down the road to expendable , interchangeable templates that do n't  properly solve design problems for the client in question . <p> Anyway , getting back on track : <p> The format was easy to follow , with the information divided up into nice little bits , each so easy to digest that when I reached the end of a section , I had to stop for a moment to realize how much I 'd actually covered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something like this : each design gets 6 pages . The intro page is a full screenshot and an introduction blurb , so its a little content-light . The other 5 pages form the bulk of the actual information . <p> Its a little deceptive because flipping through each design feels like only the briefest of explanations , until you dig in and actually start reading . Those 5 pages translate to about 6 or 7 full pages in Word , which ( in most cases ) were condensed down from 7 or 8 in the original draft , sometimes more . So we were forced to optimize our wording , cut the extraneous bits , and condense as much as we could . There 's a lot in that small space . <p> The tips in the margins were excellent . Make sure you take the time to read them . <p> Shh , secret tip : when you have to cut a bunch of information you do n't  really want to cut , try moving it to the margins . ( Many tips are extensions of the text in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the number associated with the design on csszengarden.com on each page , down in the footer maybe . It was only listed once at the beginning of the chapter . <p> Interestingly , in my original interior design draft there was more of a focus on the design number . I do n't  think I went quite as far as she 's suggesting , but it did concentrate on the number more than the final design New Riders put together for us . Incidentally , there were no individual design URLs originally , there was simply a reference to the site at the beginning of the book , and that was it . Luckily I caught that and forced the change through late last year ( much to the chagrin of the production team , and I do n't  blame them , but it had to be done ) . <p> Sometimes I felt like a subject was just touched on , but that has more to do with the breadth of topic here ( everything design- and CSS-related ) than a shortcoming of the book and the authors provide lots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point , to be sure . It was a tricky balancing act , fitting everything into the format we chose and deciding where it all went . Deciding what to cut was never easy , and there were certainly areas I wish we could have explored a lot more . <p> Although the topic is broad , there 's a lot of detailed info here . I picked up several CSS tidbits that helped me immediately ( like how to use relative positioning with absolute positioning ) . <p> I think Molly and I wrote about this particular topic at least twice each before edits . There are about 3 explanations left in the end of varying ( and complementary ) depth , so it looks as if at least one of them will stick . <p> Seriously , I do n't recommend reading it from beginning to end in one sitting . <p> Neither do I. I 'm a big fan of books that are broken into little bite-sized chunks . I absolutely love collections of short stories , for example . So that 's what we 've tried to do ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , allowing you to read them in any order you wish . <p> I do recommend reading it at the computer with your Web browser open and pointed to csszengarden.com . I used three tabs while I was reading it . One pointed to the design , one to the CSS for the design and a third to examine different graphics called out in the CSS . <p> Great way of doing it ! Some of the topics are more conducive to viewing the source than others ; many will read well without a computer at hand .

@@99593451 @3793451/ <p> Not that I 'm the first person to think this way , but I 'm becoming more and more convinced that email is a dead medium . <p> I 'm up to 150 new messages or so everytime I check certain accounts . Two or three are legit , and generally only 1 is even remotely useful . My junk folder fills up with thousands and thousands of useless messages between cleanings , and its not even remotely plausible to browse through it looking for false positives anymore . <p> The latest development is that I 'm beginning to lose the ability to communicate with people . Twice in as many weeks , I have had to run through a list of email addresses with the other party on the phone , trying to find one that has n't  been blacklisted by their mail server yet . Ive been able to make a backup address work , but for how long ? Thanks for trying , SpamCop , but please go away now . You 're making my ability to do business very difficult . <p> I 'd ask if anyone has any fixes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretty futile war . When do we all just give up and try something else instead ? 30454 @qwx890454 <p> I 'm not sure that I understand what you think the problem is . Yeah , spam is annoying . And sometimes a particular address has gotten on so many lists that you just need to start over . I have never had a problem with my address being blacklisted , though . <p> I think I am some time in the not-so-distant-future going to apply a white-listing approach . At least on my personal mail . There exists solutions where people that are not on my whitelist , will receive a bounceback explaining they 're inexistance on my whitelist , and require another reply ( possibly with some sort of code to add ) , which would automatically validate them and add them to my whitelist . This would , I hope , automatically disable spammers mail to arrive in my inbox , as I doubt theyll actively reply to the bounceback . But obviously this is an annoyance for the ones that want to send something relevant to me - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sort of feature on my business mail . <p> To prevent some of the annoyance , I could of course add new people to the whitelist if I 'm expecting mail from them . And if someone abuses their whitelisting , I 'll just blacklist them . <p> Although , actually , I cant say I receive that many spam-mails in my personal inbox anymore . Either its caught by MailScanner on the server , or by Apple Mails junk-filter . <p> Blake , Daves point is that email is becoming less and less effective as a communications tool - not that blacklisting is his problem . The problem is much bigger than that . The question is : What 's the alternative ? <p> I do n't  think the fight is futile and it sounds like you need a different strategy . I 've always found email to be fine . <p> First , I 'd use a good email service like . Mac or something instead of relying on your own domain email . Letting a company that deals with thousands of email addresses work on the spam problem instead of worrying about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> I ditched having the multiple " spam " addresses a couple years ago and have relied solely on my . mac address for everything . Do I still get spam ? Yes . About 1 a day during the heavy seasons , but usually about 3 , maybe 4 per week . Of that , 90% is caught by my junk filter . <p> And I 'm NOT careful , I sign up for EVERYTHING with it . I 've also never had my . mac account blacklisted . <p> Your situation sounds really out of control to me , definitely not the norm . If you do n't  want to pay for email either I 've heard that gmail and other free services are good about that stuff as well , but I 've always had an amazing experience with . mac so I just stick with it . <p> I was *just* about to post a similar , possibly much longer post about this . I have a million problems with email right now , but most of them are related to my increasing inability to attend to them . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> BUT , to your spam issues : Ive come to the conclusion that the useful life of a relatively spam-free e-mail address is about three years ( if you 're careful ) . Every three years ( or when it becomes a problem ) , simply change your e-mail address . Send out one e-mail to everyone in your address book telling them about your new address and then turn on an auto-responder at your old address simply pointing people to your web form . If people *really* want to get ahold of you , they should have no trouble finding you . The last time I did this was three years ago and it went flawlessly . The next time I do it will probably be next week . <p> Same here - I never really been blacklisted . Spam is annoying , but I just do n't  see anything that could replace email . <p> IM is nice , but it has the same downfall as phone communication . When I code , or work on something important I do not want to be interrupted - I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but on my own schedule . <p> I 'm under the impression that dumb people should n't be allowed to have email addresses . I 'm referring to the idiots that actually click through and *gasp* buy something via spam . <p> Its just way too easy for these spammersthey send out hundreds of thousands ( millions ? ) of spam emails a day and get results based soley on the huge number of spam emails he/she sends . <p> The problem lies in the disposibility and illegitimacy of an email addresses . Its too easy to get an email address , cloak an email , and stay anonymous . Email is just old technology but there 's nothing better ( yet ) that could take its place . <p> " I have never had a problem with my address being blacklisted , though . " <p> That 's likely the part you do n't  understand then . Try sending an important email to a business contact from two different addresses , both getting rejected by their server , before using a third supposed-to-be-personal address out of desperation . <p> " Letting a company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spam problem instead of worrying about it myself has been a huge advantage for me . " <p> Good point . That 's worth a hundred bucks a year . <p> " I used to respond to everybody . Now its like 10% . " <p> Yeah , there 's that too . At any given time I have hundreds of legit emails to reply to . I think it was Lessig that wrote about declaring email bankruptcy recently ; I can relate . <p> Gmail also does a good job of spam filtering . It works about the same as . mac using a community flagging system ( so Ive heard ) . <p> I have Media Temple , and they have a built-in spam filter which I 've been using and has been somewhat effective . If I forward that through gmail and then receive it on Apple Mail , that means my email would be running through 3 filters . <p> I use Gmail to filter out the spam . I then download via POP3 to my e-mail client ( Apple Mail ) . <p> It is extremely rare ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through both Gmails and Apple Mails filters . I probably get around 500 spam e-mails a day on Gmail as well , thanks to an old e-mail address forwarding to it . <p> The best part is thanks to Googles search abilities , I can instantly search the spam for something if it was caught by the filter by accident . Which happens maybe once a monthat most . <p> I cant help thinking that public floggings for spammers might be a nice start , but sillyness aside <p> I have to use a lot of tricks to keep email usable . I actually went so far as to explain to a friend a while back that while the e-cards were lovely , could they please use my throw-away email address to send them ? An email only has to get out to one source and you 're gone . <p> So , throwaway emails for public sites ; everything run through Gmail for convenience and hive-mind spam filtering . My own domain emails are all forwarders that can be turned into autoresponders if needs be ( legit users who actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a throwaway email to re-establish contact ) . <p> Ultimately I think well end up with email whitelists ; paired with web request forms where people can send an initial contact . We 'd still have to process requests , but I 'd still prefer that over losing contact with old friends : ) <p> I have a gmail to which all of my other addresses are forwarded . I download all of the messages into Evolution . ( This gets most of the spam ) I use Sendmail to send everything , and I have all of my addresses set up . Thus , my spam problem is n't there . Sure , I get several hundered a day , but its once every month that I see a piece of spam . <p> Dave , there are very few accurately tweaked blacklist providers . Most are afraid to be " too loose " , not because that would make them useless ( blocking 70% of your spam is still very valuable ) but because they want the high block counts for their figures . There are even lists like FIVETENIGNORE who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if your hosting a mail server even next to a spammer ( ip addressing-wise ) you get blacklisted . Sadly , there are many email administrators who install blacklists suites , which for some ridiculous reason , include lists like FIVETENIGNORE . <p> Its our job as IT professionals to inform our clients when their email admins are acting ignorantly . Let them know their email addess has essentially been placed within a virtual bunker and they need to lobby for changes to their SPAM handling procedures . <p> I rely on the services of mailnull.com ( similar to Gmails + aliasing ) to help me stop junk mail directed at a particular address . Its pretty geeky I guess , but when I start getting spam at an address I can just turn off that address . <p> And yes , Gmail has some awesome spam filtering . About the only junk I get nowadays is through the address I use for registering domain names . Thankfully its becoming standard for domain registrars to obfuscate this information for you at no charge . <p> Ive been hating email for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ information . Everything is stuck in my inbox . Ive been wanting something more like a ticketing system . Something that connects communication with calendaring and file storage . <p> I also hate how many passwords , links , and other information are stuck in there . How cool would it be if everytime I created a hosting account the FTP information could feed into BBEdit . <p> Thumbs up and a " me too " on the Gmail for your domain tip its super slick and spam is ( practically ) a thing of the past for me .. and a while back I heard something similar , about RSS replacing email eventually but I guess that is a while off yet . <p> +1 for Gmail - I 'm about to switch to Gmail for domains as well now I 've got an account . <p> My original Gmail ive had since around when they began , have a gig of mail or so on it , and although ive used the address for everything ( I 'm not great at being careful with it nor should i have to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was in exactly the same boat - 100-150 spam per day , no more than 1 or 2 legit emails amongst that . Junk folder filling up with several thousand and scanning for false positives almost impossible . <p> Thunderbirds whitelisting and bayesian filters did get it to a point where it was still usable theoretically , but I just got fed up with it nonetheless . <p> These days most people know that if they want to catch me online , theyll get a quicker response if they find me on AIM or send me a PM on one of the forums I visit daily . About the only person left who still primarily uses email to contact me is my mother ! <p> The idea is to temporarily reject unknown senders for a set period of time ( 30 seconds to a few minutes ) . Proper mailservers will wait and reattempt delivery , but most spammers will not bother with retrying . <p> The best thing about this approach is that its completely transparent to the sender . <p> I 'm not popular enough to receive so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of business to conduct , as you , which could be why I do n't  seem to have many problems with email . <p> I HAVE noticed , however , that for personal communications , email is also becoming less effective . A few years ago I would regularly trade emails with at least my closest friends , and occasionally get updates from acquaintances . Now it seems like at most I get a quick note when someone has a baby but nothing more , and certainly no responses to the nice emails I send out . ( Let 's assume for the moment that its not simply people do n't  like me any more . ) <p> I 've decided to try out this newfangled voice technology called the " phone " instead <p> If a good chunk of major e-mail providers announced that they would start using SPF in three months time and stuck to it , the rest of the world would really have to follow suit . SPF is n't a cure-all , but it does make life very difficult for spammers ( i.e. , you actually have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for it before you can send mail using it as the domain part of the return address ) . <p> I suggest supporting the Okopipi project . This is the same technology that pissed off the spammers so much that they forced Blue Security to shut down . You know something is worthwhile if it angers the spammers . The difference this time is that the servers will not be centralized : <p> Some have suggested RSS is the new e-mail . This is sort of an automatic white list , because you 're only subscribing to feeds you want messages from . I 'd at least be interesting to see an attempt at something like this . Something that handles an initial handshake between you and your contacts and then maintains your individual feeds to each one with UI that feels like e-mail . Google could do it with some sort of Gmail/Reader combo . <p> I use spamseive through apple mail , which gets most of the spambut I understand the real issue : communication . <p> I have moved to a Basecamp only communication with clients . My contact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is on Basecamp as well as everyone elses , so they can call or whatever if they like . But I make it known that email is not my primary communication , Basecamp is . <p> This is the very reason I 'm using my Gmail account more and more for all kinds of email , not just personal ones . Emails through my domain account just got into an ever-escalating war against spammers ( even being as careful as you can be about these things ) , and frankly , I have better things to do with my time than playing " spot the spam " in my Inbox every day . Entourages junk mail filters are just that - junk . <p> Looks like most of your commentors are focusing on the spam part of your post . The more frustrating part is the receipient not receiving your mail because you 've somehow fallen into the blacklist . Ive been amazed that email has lasted as long as it has . I wish that we had a trusted-based approach to email that was simple to use . One of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tools and clients to pick from for any platform . Getting people to switch to anything else would be ridiculously hard at this point . <p> For about a year Ive been try to reduce spam . I had about 15 accounts at that time , most of them were throwaway addresses at free providers , plus a few for my own domains . Most of them got spammed . <p> It took a few steps : 1- I do n't  use any catch-all on my domains 2- I do n't  use free email like hotmail , free.fr , etc. anymore . They get tons of spam even if you do n't  use the address at all ! I killed all free email accounts , except two of them I still use . 3- Everytime I subscribe to a website , forum , online shop , I create a " spy " alias on one of my domains . Say if I subscribe to digg I will use digg@mydomain.com . So if I get spam , I 'll know where it came from . <p> So what 's the result ? - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 25/30 a day - I did n't  get a single spam on my " spy " aliases . It seems most websites are honest when they say they wont spam you ! - the most polluted account is my main one , the one I NEVER give on any website . My guess is I get most of the spam via friends and clients with spam viruses , people who send stupid e-cards or send jokes to 30 people at a time . <p> use IM instead . i have a " group " in adium that 's clients , since i get a couple hundred spams a day . if i 'm working i just make myself visible to the client group so they can get in touch . if i 'm working *hard* i just invisible . <p> Ive been using FuseMail ( http : //www.fusemail.com ) for a couple of years now and really like it . They provide a very cheap hosted IMAP account ( IMAP is to POP3 as Web 2.0 is to Web 1.0 ) that you can access over the web or with any desktop client @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all of your various e-mail accounts from other providers into one account and you can even keep @myowndomain.com e-mail addresses . <p> They also have a very good spam filtering system . There are multiple lines of defense and you can configure it to meet your requirements and sensitivity . Check them out . <p> I cant believe nobody has yet recommended Postini . I was half-seriously in doubt about my future employment ( over complaints about spam from all our users ) until my CEO , in desperation , set it up with our email host LanLogic . Within a week , all discussion about spam in the company ceased . $10/month/user is a heck of a lot cheaper than my time maintaining SpamAssassin et al . <p> You point your MX to Postini , they filter and forward it to your original MX . Nice web-admin page for each user , so my admin time is now zero . It seems they only work with providers ( like ISPs ) thoughbug your ISP or other email provider to offer it to their users ; its worth it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ OFFER IT TO INDIVIDUALS . You will take over the world in short order . ) <p> Do n't  have an issue with spam as big as yours , yet . If it gets to that let , I might just to break out ye ole pen and ink and actually write a letter , stuff it in that white rectangular thingy , carefully affix self-adhesive postage and manually deliver it to my mechanical mail server ; ) <p> I think one of the salient points that 's getting lost in the discussion is not *if* its possible to gain control of your mail , but whether , if most people cant/dont because they do n't  know all these clever tricks and techniques , then that results in the death of email as a ( perceived ) ubiquiitous communications medium by default . <p> Once email gains a widespread reputation for unreliability ( and Ive seen some interesting demographic studies recently that suggests that younger folks are , in certain respects , abandoning email in favor of IM , etc. ) , then it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy that no amount @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to happen , but its worrisome when so many technically capable people are throwing up their hands in sheer frustration at an apparently failing medium . Maybe GMail will save us all ? <p> Most people are fixating on spam filtration , but I certainly was talking more to the increasing unreliability that spam is causing . <p> Though I hear everyone else loud and clear , and will consider outsourcing my email to GMail/Basecamp/whatever ( provided I can keep the same addresses , which comment #20 confirms I can do ) , those comments in particular that got at the gist of my meaning were #3 , #17 , #27 , and #49 . Thanks guys : <p> E-Mail was great because you did n't  rely on someone elses software or connection - it was just a protocol . The only way to fix e-mail without resorting to someone elses software is to make a new protocol . <p> The unfortunate part about all of this is that most alternatives Ive seen are dependant on other people/companies . <p> You want to use a form of instant messaging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else to filter your e-mail ? Controlled by someone elses software . While I 'm sure they have top-notch programmers , of course , no piece of software is completely safe . How long until that gets hacked ? How long until an employee makes a hole because a spamming network offers him money for it ? <p> On top of that , all of that gives those companies insane amounts of power . Knowledge is power and if their software/system replaces e-mail , they have possibly more knowledge than anyone else in the world . <p> If everyone in the world switches to gmail , well eliminate the spam but I 'm scared of spam FAR LESS than I am of a single corporation controlling the worlds e-mail . <p> Few things I would suggest , for different levels of **25;469;TOOLONG filtration : <p> 1 ) Unimportant email : Make up email addresses for unimportant stuff ( registration websites , etc ) to go to http : //www.mailinator.com ( a free service that automatically receives email at any address , and that anyone can read ) . <p> 2 ) Non-critical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the same email address . As you notice more and more spam coming through one of the accounts , simply cut it off , and create another . <p> 3 ) Important email : Send/Receive and follow through with a phone call or an IM message . <p> 4 ) Critical email : Do not use email for critical stuff . It is not secure , can get lost , etc . Phones , and if you must , encrypted IM protocols are far better at this . <p> 5 ) **33;496;TOOLONG is a bad idea and should be avoided like the plague . <p> Someone above suggested a handshake email system ( much like TCP ) for sites that have not been whitelisted . This would double , if not triple , email usage , even IF they do get whitelisted the second they reply . Besides , it would n't be hard to automate replying to such messages . <p> Usually I receive about 200 spammails per day and I had a long time many problems to filter them . Two weeks ago I had to install my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was wondering that Outlook is filtering 90% of the spam mails the rest I get by an blacklist of keywords . This week only 3 spams out of 1000 made it to my inbox . At the moment I-m lucky . But as long as people can easy hide behind ips in hijacked pcs we will have problems . Email is one of the fastest and cheapest ways of communication and I can-t see an other option . <p> The picture is n't that dark . Most filters these days catch spam and separate it from legitimate emails , putting it under a single click deletion option after taking a quick look on . Sure its not 100% accurate but at least it reduces your pain to its minimal . <p> I feel your pain . It makes it harder to communicate what with having to find the nuggets of gold in the mountain of fools gold . It involves more sifting than I care for . Even with all sorts of message rules set up , its still a chore . Between all my accounts , I get over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or so are from groups , and only half-dozen or so are directed to me and important . I 'm starting to tell people to use really telling subject lines so I do n't  miss the legit one . I tend to delete mails in blocks at a time so deleting something good is quite possible nowadays . Its a fantastic communication medium that has sadly been abused to death . <p> Hi Stephen , I agree that there are dozens of more unprofessional things that using gmail . Geocities indeed . : - ) <p> Using any " free " domain email such as gmail , msn , hotmail , aol , etc. for business just screams amature . I mean , come on , how many Fortune 500 corporations use flyboy323@gmail.com or 23jdl2trn@aol.com or menohavewebsite@aol.com addresses to correspond with their clients ? <p> Given the availability of professional antivirus and antispam filtering on the mail server level , there is no reason I can think of to use gmail for business . The trick is to make sure your web host uses it , oh , and uses it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they do n't  . As web professionals , we are often more concerned with what version of PHP or . NET a provider has installed vs. what kind of spam filtering they do . Its simply another requirement that should be met for choosing to do business with a web host running your domain . We ourselves have 7 email addresses on our domain and receive on average , about 1-2 items of spam every month and that 's it . <p> But using G$ or M$ for your business email ? Not me . Nothing is ever really free , and you are either carrying their logo feces at the bottom of all your business communications or having THE critical element of your communication ( email ) out of your control and dependent on some 3rd party search engine company or OS maker . <p> But I digress off topic . The issue that email is a " dead medium " is silly and I do n't  agree with that . Look at the hassles of using a telephone . The sales calls , the marketing , the voicemail hell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and so forth . Using a telephone just sucks today . Or just look at the hassles of driving on a freeway . <p> There are annoyances and hassles that arise in just about any modern invention . Email has gotten worse , yes , but it just simply requires more strict managementnot giving up on it all together as that will never happen in the business arena . But the idea does make for fun blog topic , though . <p> I 'm a gmail user too , and have 5 very active email accounts that I forward to and reply from gmail , since allows me to pick which account I am sending out from . Life became much easier after I finally got all of this setup . <p> But I find communication less vital through email as a whole . I get a lot of emails but most are subscription based things I signed up for . RSS is my main source of update notification , and IM is by far my largest form of client interaction . I let gmail just do its own thing and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fine . <p> and now I guess with google apps for your domain , https : //www.google.com/a/ you can just get your own custom gmail for your domain setup , and you do n't  have to do all the forwarding and stuff I guess . I have n't tried this solution , having my one gmail account setup for all my domain emails to forward to is working out just fine . <p> What 's ( almost ) worse than spam itself are auto-responses to spam . I do n't  care that you 're out of the office till Tuesday , or that you 've got white list set up because I did not send you the damn e-mail - some spammer did . Please , please , please , before you enable or install anything that auto-responds to e-mail , make sure it does n't  blindly auto-respond to every incoming e-mail . <p> I agree , spam really is a pain in the ass . On my brand new Gmail account I get around 50 spam emails a day . Fortunately , Gmails spam filter appropriately forwards them all to the trash . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ post a comment on a blog , I always use a fake email address , thanks to http : //spamgourmet.com/ . For example this blog . I used the email address **31;531;TOOLONG . I have no problem giving it out on the internet because no one knows my real email address . : <p> I know EXACTLY what you mean . The worst I have had was trying to communicate with an editor who could n't recieve my email . Talk about infuriating . I kept responding to his email , but it was quickly obvious that he was n't recieving a thing from me . <p> On a tangential note . I have a spammer hitting the contact form on my website with linkspam for google . This results in several " Contact Form " messages in my inbox which used to be 100% legit . The infuriating thing is that they continue to do this even though its completely useless for them . These posts do not show up on any web page anywhere . <p> The root of the problem in this case is vulnerable Windows machines that serve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time to infect a few machines . It used to be there was some marginal charge for spamming , but now it is literally free to send billions and billions of spam messages per hour . Thank you Microsoft and the American Consumer . <p> Spam is annoying , true . But whilst more legislation may help ( particularly in the US , CAN-SPAM was/is a disaster ) there are a number of low-cost things we can do ourselves to combat the problem . <p> First , get your own domain , and give out different addresses for every purpose ( such as posting here - if you were to sell my address to a spammer , I 'd disable the alias Ive given you ) . Whilst I get maybe 5,000 items of spam a year to a couple of spamtrap addresses , I get none on my main alias . At all , without filtering . And I 've used the domain solidly for three years . <p> On Spamcop , they seem to be the target of much ire , which would be much more appropriately directed to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My mail server has been in the SC sin-bin a few times , but I complain to my provider , not Spamcop - after all , it was my provider that allowed a spammer onto their servers in the first place . My provider sees it this way too , and ( unlike other providers I have dealt with ) does not whinge about IP blacklisting - they kick the spammer off , and apologise to any customers on the same IP/range . <p> It is good to remember also that when the Spam Cop Blocking List prevents your recipient from getting your email , it is their provider that *chose* to use Spamcop . No-one forced it on them . If a recipient is not happy with that situation , they are free to choose another provider that does not use Spamcop . <p> But for what its worth , I think Spamcop are taking the right approach . Legislation is never going to be the total solution - partly because it is easy to overlegislate , and partly because some regions will never legislate . <p> We are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use of email , and service providers that make it easy to do this ( such as systems to manage multiple aliases , as well as good filtering mechanisms ) will carve a niche for themselves . <p> If you can afford to , you can take the most effective and drastic measure possible to clear out spam - disable your email account for a day ( or two ) . Once all the spam has been bounced back , your email will practically be removed from all the spam lists . <p> Obviously this is a pretty drastic measure and will either require some planning on your part ( like warning your clients beforehand ) . <p> Personally , the good old fashioned telephone works the best for me . There 's too much room for misunderstanding with email . It does n't  matter how well you can express your thoughts in words if your client ca n't do the same . Email is usually relegated to sending invoices . <p> Until I got my gmail account , I never knew there was so many ways to spell Viagra . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ couple of more ideas . <p> I used my ISP mail as a private mail address for a couple of years , but made the mistake of using it to send a mail to 10-15 people that needed a message while my spam-able account ( College mail address ) was down due to poor administrating and an open SMTP server . <p> Anyway , result was that I started to get spam to that account to . Yet another email account lost to spam , dang it ! <p> My solution is : I keep at least three seperat emailadresses with different levels of " security " if you can call it that . Number1 ) A total spam adress . Every time I need to create an account to access a website og enter a competition or anything in that matter I use this adress . This gets spammed up in no time , but who cares Number2 ) Semi-spam adress . I use it for things I have a genuine interest in , so I do n't  want it getting lost in the spam , but is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ primary adress , which is used for personal mail and extremely important mail for online stuff . I hardly get any spam at this adress <p> Luckily gmail is happy to offer more than one account Works for me : - ) Cheers Rusty <p> I then set it to automatically delete anything that 's in the blacklist automatically , I do n't  even see it . <p> about 10 - 15 slip through a day but once black listed i never see them again after proccessing . <p> I havent had spam in outlook express ( or a virous ) in about 4 years . I actually use mailwasher to reply to all my emails now and only open outlook when mailwasher starts getting cluttered with email ( about 3 times a day because I get so many emails ) <p> at one point I was getting over a thousand spam emails a day now I only get about 10 new ones and no idea ( do n't  bother checking ) of how many I get now , it checks every 5 minutes but I do n't  bother looking untill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it will also deside if its spam or not before telling you , you have new email . ) <p> Hi Dave , If you can live with using Microsofts Hotmail as your interface , I recommend creating an account over at https : //domains.live.com .

@@99593452 @3793452/ <p> You probably experience this on a regular basis : a client sends you an illustration or a logo theyd like to use in a project , but its a low-res bitmap or a flat image file with a background texture . Or both , if you 're really lucky . Sure , you can try and ask for a vector version , but more often than not what they originally sent was the best copy they had on hand . <p> I seem to have made something of a hobby out of trying to coax useful results out of this type of file . Over the years I 've stumbled across far better ways of doing it than manually clipping the background with the the magic wand or various selection tools . <p> For the next time you 're handed a less-than-ideal source image , here are a few of my tricks for isolating the part of the file I want to work with in Photoshop . <p> Ill use this Firefox promo image as an example . Yeah , I know I can find a vector version of this particular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demo thanks to the complexity of the background . <p> Let 's start with the text . A single , flat colour ends up being fairly easy to extract . The first step is using the Hue/Saturation sliders Ctrl / Cmd + U to drop the saturation all the way down to a value of -100 : <p> Then trim away the surrounding pixels to focus on the area you want : <p> Next use the levels sliders Ctrl / Cmd + L to increase the contrast on either side so that the background is black and the text is white . The trick is doing it in a way that does n't  completely kill the anti-aliasing between the text and the background , while at the same time making sure the foreground/background colours are pure black and white . You do n't  want stray pixels on either side , otherwise nasty things will happen later on when you try using your results . If you just cant find a balance , use the brush tool to fill in the strays manually . <p> The best results come from images where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind it . In this case it is , so I 'm able to get a reasonably high-contrast result : <p> At this point you have two choices . If you do n't  need the ability to change the colour of the text or apply layer effects , you can stop now and set the layers blending mode to Screen or invert it ( Ctrl / Cmd + I ) and set the mode to Multiply . With the either of those blend modes you should be able to place this high-contrast layer over top of a background and itll be treated as isolated text . The key being placing it on top of non-transparent background ; if there are no pixels beneath for the layer to blend with , you wont be able to save it out the same way it renders in Photoshop . <p> For that extra control you need to take it further . By holding down Ctrl / Cmd and clicking on the images layer in the Layers palette you can select just the outline ; copy that to the clipboard , open the Channels palette @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clipboard into that channel . If you 've done it right it should look something like this : <p> Figure : Ctrl/Cmd + clicking on the channel produces selection marching ants in the preview . You cant see the animation , but they 're there . <p> The same way you selected the outline of the image in the Layers palette , you can Ctrl / Cmd + click in the Channels palette and the selection will change to just the border between the background and foreground . If you switch back to the Layers palette and create a new Solid Color fill layer : <p> The text now sits on an isolated layer that allows you to easily change the colour , apply layer effects , etc . <p> The icon is more complicated . We 've got a strong orange foreground , but the globe and the background share some tones so extracting is going to be trickier . This is a fairly common scenario in the wild , but the good news is that its still doable in most cases . <p> Let 's be a little more selective about what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the orange fox for now , well come back for the globe . The Select &gt; Color Range tool allows you to click an area and select all colours similar to that selection point , and the Fuzziness slider controls how loosely or tightly the selection matches that colour . Selecting the blue area instead of the orange produces a much higher-contrast outline of the orange area : <p> Once you hit okay you 're left with marching ants . The selection is n't useful yet , so back to the Channels palette we go . Create a new alpha channel and fill the selection with white : <p> Now you can just pull up the Levels palette and , with the same high-contrast result in mind as the previous text example , adjust the levels until the fox is pure black and the background is as pure white as you can make it : <p> If you hit Ctrl / Cmd + click on the channel then head back to the Layers palette and select the original , you can click the Add Layer Mask button in the bottom of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the orange areas we 've managed to extract : <p> If you end up with too many fringe pixels from the background , you can hit Ctrl / Cmd + select the mask again , and use the Select &gt; Modify &gt; Contract tool to decrease the selection 1px on all sides . Invert this smaller selection with Ctrl / Cmd + Shift + I , then select and fill with black the layer mask to apply it . This will eat up a one pixel outline around the object , which should take care of the fringe without tossing out too much image data . Though it does depend on the size of the source image . <p> We now want to add the globe back in , so duplicate the layer and remove the mask to show the original image again . Manually trace the outline of the globe with the circular marquee tool , select the masked layer and fill that selection with white within the mask . And there we go , an isolated version of the Firefox icon that you can manipulate as you please : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but once you get the hang of it you 'll find its fairly quick work to go from a source image to something usable . <p> For relatively simple jobs like the text , the process is straightforward and can be done in a couple of seconds . For more complicated extraction as in the case of the icon , creative alpha masking combined with a bit of manual tweaking will usually get the job done . <p> ( And I do n't  have to remind you to always use this for good and never for evil , do I ? ) <p> I often find the Extract tool is useful for this stuff . This is no longer installed by default in CS4 , but is an optional plugin . <p> It has the ability to extract foreground shapes from a background with the correct colour and alpha channel right to the edges . This solves the problem of coloured fringe pixels that you suggest cutting off by contracting the edges of the mask . <p> The Extract tool is partially replaced by the Background Eraser tool in CS4 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ job . However , it does n't  always work perfectly , so your alpha channel solution is sometimes better . <p> Good stuff . To me , the first step is to always run it through http : //vectormagic.com and see how good/bad the output is . VectorMagic is a project originated at Stanford and it blows away every other raster-to-vector technology Ive ever seen ( especially what it built into Adobe products ) . <p> The Firefox logo is a tough customer because of the complexity as you mention but a lot of other logos come out of VectorMagic almost as if they were originals . <p> These are some useful tips , using channels to change isolated colors or backgrounds is a good way of getting clean results , but they all always at some point need to involve the marquee tool , in my opinion never use the magic wand tool its rubbish just get stuck in with the marquee zoom in nice and close that way you can be more hap hazard with your lines allowing to to get the job done faster . <p> Useful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " use the logo from our old site because we do n't  have the original " . I 've always ended up either re-drawing it , or using the pen tool , will give this a go next time . <p> I 'm very impressed about the technique you describe . I never understood how you can isolate perfectly a logo from a background ( always a problem with a coloured background and a white background website ) . Thanks , I will try this . <p> Ca n't remember how many times i had this specific problem . I 'd always prefer struggling with photoshop instead of trying to talk the client into finding a better sample or using the pen tool to get something vectoral . <p> Anyway , ill be using this technique and this time , ill know what i 'm doing : D Thanks ! 
@@99593453 @3793453/ <p> The past few months has dealt the web string of disappointing news item one after another . Microsoft all but killed IE , AOL gave Netscape the touch of death , and Eolas plugin patent is making things really difficult . <p> The web is more popular than ever , but the major forces behind it are pulling out . Now is the time for all good men to come to well , you know how that one goes . <p> Soon the Mozilla foundation will re-launch mozilla.org ( available now in public beta ) in the hopes of gaining back the market share that AOL/Netscape conceded to Microsoft over the past 5 years . That is to say , the 90% plus share that Internet Explorer currently enjoys somehow must erode for the Mozilla Foundation to be successful . <p> They are competing head-on with Redmond , and no one more than they recognizes what a monumental undertaking this is . Microsoft is only helping by letting Internet Explorer stagnate , but the remaining installed base is huge and it will take drastic measures to undermine its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a company with over $40 billion in cash on hand ? <p> They 're going to need some help . <p> Why do n't  we all just let Microsoft continue its dominance of the market and let them call the shots ? Because competition is in the best interest of everyone . An application service provider needs a free and open platform that does n't  cost an arm and a leg to get a foot in the door . A web developer needs non-proprietary , well-supported standards to decrease development time and focus on more important issues like accessibility and usability . Businesses large and small need the chance to compete in an environment without the threat of one company with an illegally-gained monopoly easily crushing them if they 're deemed competition . An end user needs a secure computing environment . IE offers none of these . <p> Why is it important for Mozilla to win ?

Decisions made will be in the interests of everyone , not for financial gain of the few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ IE is a good thing . Support Opera , love Safari . But long term , Mozilla must capture a significant enough portion of that share to prevent us from ending up here again . <p> The Mozilla Foundation ca n't do this alone . They need the help of developers , distributers , and designers . If you have n't yet begun using Mozilla 1.5 ( released today to coincide with the new site ) or Firebird 0.7 ( also released today ) , why not ? If your browser of choice is symbolized by a stylized blue e , perhaps you should investigate the other options available . <p> And do n't  stop with yourself . Tell a friend . Tell five . The first time you demonstrate a browser that just does n't  allow pop-up windows , you will have made a friend .

@@99593455 @3793455/ <p> Well now there 's a rumour going around that Microsoft may stop development of Internet Explorer , to focus on MSN instead . See the comments in Craig Sailas post on CSS flubs in IE. <p> This makes sense from a business standpoint . The browser war is long won , so its time to stop offering a free product and begin making money on monthly services . Consider the Mac OS situation MSN for Mac OS X was released last week , when we have n't seen an update for Mac IE5 in how long now ? I 'd be willing to wager that , with Safari and Chimera on the radar , and given the average Macheads disdain for Microsoft , one is n't forthcoming either . <p> Its tough to predict longterm strategy from the outside , but it would n't surprise me if we only see one or two more revisions of IE for the PC before its left behind . Which gives the average PC user three choices pay for MSN service , download an alternate browser , or simply do n't  upgrade . <p> Good points Adam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its so damn fast . I honestly tried to make the switch to Netscape 7 or Mozilla , but I just could n't get around how sluggish they were in comparison . <p> You gave me a push . I just downloaded Firebird , something I 've been meaning to do for a while now . ( good call on streamlining the installation , itll only catch on when everythings automatic and the end user just has to push Yes buttons ) . <p> Microsoft is about having control . As long as they continue to produce the most used OS on the planet , why would they want give users a REASON not to use IE ? It just does n't  make sense . Sure the browser wars have begun again and IE is falling behind . I do n't  think Mr Gates is going to be happy with that for long . <p> My thinking is that this is n't about standards at all , or even the browser . <p> Does Microsoft really care about supporting the latest and greatest standards if a ) they can maintain 90% of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off of MSN ? <p> I 'm all for further compliance to the W3 , but Microsoft virtually owns the browser market right now . What incentive do they have to continue development of a free product , when they can increase use of their paid service ? Its not going to take much to do that . Most users do n't  care about their browser or how well it supports web standards , they care about the user experience of getting on the web . If Microsofts marketing budget is being spent on promoting the cool new features of MSN and making people want it , people will get it . <p> Mozilla ai n't  gon na change this without a significant shift in strategy , because its still too hard for the average user to download a browser . This is not about which product is better . We all know the answer to that . But better technologies do n't  always win . Beta/VHS , anyone ? <p> Who knows . Its all moot anyway if IEs life cycle does n't  end in a year or two . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in that rumour . <p> Joel writes , " Microsoft has settled the lawsuit with AOL , agreeing to pay AOL $750,000,000 in a complicated deal that allows AOL to continue to use Internet Explorer for several years . I 'm not sure why the second part is interesting . " <p> In light of the recent news that " IE6 SP1 is the final standalone installation " , I think this could be an interesting way of lulling AOL into complacency . <p> Let 's say that the rumors are true , and IE development is at a standstill . What 's to prevent Microsoft from putting a ton of resources into the MSN browser and zooming past a totally unprepared AOL ? <p> This would leave AOL with some poor options : * stick with the vanilla IE6 , long surpassed by a superior MSN , or * get **33;564;TOOLONG to the point where it could be comfortably used by existing AOL users <p> Joe , I just about missed this . It would have been relevant in one of the more recent threads too , but you may miss my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't  know there 's much need to speculate anymore . The whole building it in to the OS talk is a euphemism for saying " sure , you 'll get basic browser support for Windows alright , but you 'll want to pay us for our internet services to get the latest and greatest , MSN . " Time may prove me wrong , but I think Internet Explorer is now dead . It may get the odd kick in the ribs to keep it breathing , but MSN is where all future development is going to go . <p> So your what-if scenario is far closer to a now-what ? AOL is hemmorhaging cash , but can they afford to sit back and rest on IE for the next 7 years , knowing full well that its dead in the water now ? Doubtful . Mozilla will go on . Netscape is probably dead . But for AOL to rely on Microsoft is like the fawn lying down next to the sleeping 700lb grizzly and hoping to God that it does n't  wake up . <p> Its sad to hear that MS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ browser and replace it with a larger , more complicated one that will support future technologies , just to gain a buck . <p> I personally enjoy the integration of IE , and I will miss that in Longhorn . After using Mozilla and Netscape I realize that I do n't  like load time , any load time . I 'm not looking forward to having to wait . But in the meantime , I 'm happy Ive still got IE6 , and who knows what the future will hold ? 30455 @qwx890455 30451 @qwx890451 <p> You are reading " The End of IE ?

@@99593456 @3793456/ <p> I began this as a comment to my last update , but it hits on too many important points to be buried " below the fold " . The content management fest continues . <h> The Trouble is <p> What inherently bothers me about Content Management in general is that the content owner ( the client ) has full control . <p> This rarely becomes a problem in companies with onstaff copywriters and designers , but coming from a web firm with a much smaller client base ( in size as well as scope ) , I only infrequently get to work with this type of client . Instead , I deal mainly with &lt;50 employee companies . <p> These are the sort of clients who will litter newsletters with clip art . These are the guys that are notorious for sending out email laced with " wht do u think ? " These are the clients that pass along a 100x80 pixel GIF from a random site on the web and ask you to blow it up to 6 inches for their annual report . <p> I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ studio photos , but in reality I must get a hundred " welcome to our web site , tell us what you think of it ! " for each of those , and a hundred more poorly lit , highly JPGed digital photos . Or magazine scans . Or images stolen from other peoples web sites . You get the idea . <h> A Helping Hand <p> Being at least wellread , if not wellwrit , I do n't  mind fixing copy . But if I am to do that , I would also like the ability to obsess about the typographical considerations , and make sure the page meshes as a coherent whole . <p> which pretty much obliterates the need for a CMS in the first place . Back to square one . <p> Ill be the first to admit that I do n't  know my clients industries . I do n't  know how to build a snowboard , and Ive never manufactured chocolate by hand . I have n't a clue what legal considerations a lawyer needs to make when providing free information to the general public . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of a web site . <p> I know how to increase the number of unique visitors a site gets in a month . I know what can be safely used on a site , and what violates copyright laws . I 've helped triple sales on more than one site , I know why users drop shopping carts , and I know how to increase exposure of selected pages . This is what a client pays me for , because she cant do it herself . <p> But these techniques are only as good as the minds behind them . When I relinquish control , and begin trusting the client to handle the promotion and development themself , I walk a dangerous line between making myself redundant and allowing my client to fail . <h> Some Suggestions <p> What I support is a middle ground . There is a way to allow the client control over the regular , minor changes , while keeping him safe from himself . <p> Content creation needs to be a collaborative process . The web developer should be willing to work with the client @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of meetings , emails , and brainstorm sessions . And it should be wellunderstood that this is an ongoing process . It does n't  end when a site goes live . <p> Feature creep , or the addition of " one more thing " that the client thought of while in the bath last night is the bane of the web developer . Many ways of combatting this have been developed , but the fundamental problem is that web development has been shoehorned into an allegorical publishing process , which is n't true to the format . It should be recognized that a site is a living , breathing entity , and if not continuously updated to give the user a reason to come back , it will wither and die . <p> Updates made solely by the client should be limited to changing factual information . These are timeconsumers that the developer neednt trouble herself with . The client can and should have the ability to modify information that has no consequence to site marketing and flow . <h> Things are Rarely Perfect <p> This is not a onesizefitsall solution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every client needs a unique approach . Some clients will involve their own talent in the process , leaving you much less to accomplish . These are the type that a CMS will benefit the most . <p> But most others are approaching the developer for direction of their online strategy . Their budgets may be small , their focus narrow , but they are looking to us to lead the way . We can choose to follow their directions to the letter , but our work can only be at its most effective when the client and the web developer work together . 30454 @qwx890454 30455 @qwx890455 30451 @qwx890451 <p> You are reading " More on CMS " , an entry posted on 13 November , 2002 , to the Pods collection .

@@99593458 @3793458/ <p> Maybe I have n't been paying close enough attention , but over the past few years an interesting variation of CSS Sprites has been getting a lot of play on large web sites that serve millions of users . <p> I stumbled over one of these on Amazon and posted an image here last week , but the comments quickly pointed out that this was far from a unique case . Google , Yahoo , and Apple are also doing similar , and those are just the ones Ive found so far . Yahoo even documents the practice on their Developer Network and the Flickr code blog . <p> The problem is making a site with multiple UI elements load quickly . There 's a lot of overhead if your design requires dozens of UI images and icons and the like . File size is n't the only factor , each image is called with a separate HTTP request , and the more of those you have the longer your site takes to load . At Yahoo and Google traffic levels , its vitally important to think about how many million @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times . <p> The solution ? Cram as many UI images as possible into a single image , then use selective CSS to clip and only show the relevant part of the image : <p> Andy King has written up a great how-to guide on implementing sprites this way . He does warn that the method is n't without its issues some devices ( the iPhone being the most notable ) apply the sprites in a memory-intensive way that slows the device to a crawl . <p> I also wonder about the pop-in effect ; when your entire UI is in one or two larger images that take a second or so to load , the site will render without images for that brief time then pop in all the images at once . This reminds me a bit of the FOUC of old , but in a slightly less jarring way . Probably a necessary evil in this case . <p> But the question I 've had on my mind is whether I should start doing this myself . Should all the sites I build use Sprites this way from now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approach for UI images , and I 'm finding it quick going and fairly simple to do . From Photoshop , I crop my source images and prepare to save , but rather than export to a JPG / GIF / PNG I 'll instead take a flattened version of each image and place it in a new document that becomes the master , saving out the entire thing to an optimized image . ( And if I go with PNG , its worth also running a non-Adobe PNG compression tool against it , something like Pngcrush or PngThing . ) <p> Planning for repeating images is a bit trickier , but I think the MobileMe example serves as a guide . Have one image per row , leave room between each , and have the repeating bits span the entire master image width rather than the smaller 1 pixel strip you might traditionally have saved out . The extra overhead will compress fairly well , and it seems fairly certain that the fewer HTTP requests will more than make up for it . <p> So , back to the question at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think the answer is : sort of , yes . <p> It does require more work . Applying the section of the master sprite image you want to show up takes time . And you really need to carefully plan out that master sprite image to ensure the wrong slice does n't  show through on text-resize or in unplanned text wrapping situations . I do n't  see every site benefitting enough to justify the time overhead . <p> Of course , the maintenance is also easier ; need to change the colour of a UI element ? Just edit the master and re-save one image . Done . Need to add more images ? Make the master a little larger and drop em in . Done . <p> Web applications where a quick-loading and responsive UI are essential seem like the perfect fit . Sites with a common set of design elements that are used globally across the site might also benefit . <p> But I doubt most sites will require you to go as far as the every-image-in-one like the MobileMe example ; a lighter approach of , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like Yahoo is likely good enough most of the time . And simple wins like taking a box with rounded corners which traditionally would have been three separate images ( one for the top , repeating middle , and bottom ) and combining those three into one is fairly trivial to pull off . <p> The main change I expect is that I 'll likely look for ways of reducing the overall number of images I save out for each site in the future . If I can see a quick way of combining a half dozen into one , I 'll do it . If I cant , oh well . If I end up with 12 images instead of 20 , that 's probably optimized enough for the majority of sites I 'll build . <p> I find it a pain in the ass to do it by hand if you have to resize some of the sprites it throws off the co-ordinates of all the others , and you then have to figure out what their new co-ordinates are and change them in the CSS . Its even worse when you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Google Web Toolkit has a neat auto-spriting feature that takes all your separate images and compiles them into a sprite ( well , a couple of sprites , for horizontal and vertical repeating images ) . Of course , then you have to buy into the whole GWT platform . <p> Great write up Dave . Ive been thinking about sprites off and on for the past few years I 've decided I 'm on the fence with sprites <p> You said : " Just edit the master and re-save one image . " <p> This sounds good , but <p> " instead take a flattened version of each image and place it in a new document that becomes the master " <p> if the master is a compilation of flattened images , then it requires more work in that you have to grab your comp , tweak that , then crop , flatten and import into the new master . I also second what Cameron is saying about having to re-tweak coordinates <p> Of course , I say all this and I do n't  work on sites that get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure I 'd use this solution . <p> But given the way I design its easier for me to flatten each out first before combining . If I have one element spread across ten images , and changing the colour of that element requires tweaking ten layers , I 'd rather tweak ten layers once and flatten+recombine , then tweak ten layers x ten images . <p> Also , if you happen to use Photoshop , you could just use smart objects in your combined file . Then , when you change any of the original images , the smart object automatically updates and you do n't  have to re-copy it over to your combined one . You can just flatten and/or export the compilation as a flattened filetype , then run any optimizations you want on that exported image and you 're good to go . <p> I 've moved away from doing massive numbers of images in one sprite ; I actually experimented with it a few years ago ( shortly after your original article , I think ) on a couple large web apps , and ran into some of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on file compression once you start combining huge numbers of dissimilar graphics . <p> Speaking of compression , as I recall , another issue that pops up when you have massive numbers of images in one sprite is that your arrangement of them can drastically change the amount of compression I 'm sure this has been written up somewhere , but if you have a large number of buttons it seems to be more economical ( particularly with GIF , less so with 8-bit PNG ) to put them in a long vertical file . The simple explanation I read way back when was that having a large number of vertical lines ( whitespace between graphics for example ) in a GIF balloons the compression due to some quirk of LZW mind you , even bad compression of repetitive elements is better than none , ie. not using sprites at all . <p> I tend to make smaller groups of sprites now , grouped by functionality or placement in the layout one file for buttons , one for icons , one for image replacement text , etc . <p> Ive been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needed some sort of graphic feedback to the users attempt to control a dial or knob or whatever . I was surprised to discover the same concept being discussed for use in web pages when I was surfing the net a while back . Heck why not ? <p> I find that I use sprites for parts of the page that seem to be related ( like a nav , etc ) , but I do n't  like including every image into one master image . If its already a large image , I will leave it out alone . <p> Its not as simple as throw all the images into one image . One image probably is n't your best bet , as browsers can download your images in parallel . Using multiple sub-domains for the images can have a dramatic effect . <p> You can also get into issues with color maps . If you have two images that can both get by with 8-bit color maps , that does n't  mean you can put them into one new image with an 8-bit color map ( you need the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bits ) . Going form an 8-bit png to a 24 or 32-bit png can have a big impact on your file size . So , very often , you 'll want to group images with similar colors to keep file size lower . <p> Also , if you have EVERY image , you 're probably sending too much info on your home page . Case by case - but generally speaking , if you have a dominant landing page , its worth tuning a version of the CSS / JS / Images just for it to make your first impression as snappy as possible . <p> This is very effective , I have used the general idea in the past , however I 'm not so sure it works with fluid sites . The MobileMe example gets around the width issue but what about height when text scales ? <p> I generally take each interface element on its merits and group images in that way . <p> Using sprites quickly showed you need about 5 different sprite images . Our designers love making patterns which are repeated vertically or horizontally . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ images with 1px width and an enormous height ( adding the images together ) . And a similar sprite for all vertical repeated images . <p> Then there are the images you need to align on top or bottom , which i pop together in a sprite side by side . Of course there are also images you want to align left or right , that ones are in a different sprite stacked . <p> The last sprite i use for icons likewise google does for their side packed in the smallest possible way . <p> I tried the tools told here for sprites but had problems with all this 5 sprite variants . And since i do n't  like gaps which are not needed , we build our own little java application where you can decide which way you need the images aligned . It saves the image and also give you a css output with all the background positions . <p> That way its always possible to add or remove images without much work . <p> I tried using PNG Thing on an image and did n't  see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with PNG-24 . Save for Web in Photoshop got it down to 160bytes , which is only slightly above GIF which came in at 150bytes . <p> Annoyingly , Finder ca n't seem to tell you how big a file really is if its smaller than 4KB for some reason . <p> Its quite a task to get it vertically and horizontally right . It may mean to make compromises here and there . You can not place all images in one , when you for example need a middle image which scales on both axis . <p> In the qooxdoo JS framework ( http : //qooxdoo.org ) I was involved in we have a json-like configuration where one defines which source images to combine to a larger one . The tool chain then automatically created a combined image and a json data stucture with offsets to be used via JS . The application developer works with the original path names in the application but automatically make use of the combined images when they are available . It is quite useful to automate it this way . Though it does not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not rendered via JS . ( Ok , maybe some kind of CSS rewrite can do something like this too . ) <p> Regarding resizing issues . I 've started using sprites selectively and my method for resizing is to simply give the graphic some extra vertical height . This works for gradients well enough . So if I have a menu item that 's normally 50px high , I 'll take that 50px high gradient , make the canvas 100px or so , and then repeat the top pixel to fill the extra 50px . If that does n't  work , just give some space between each graphic to allow for resizing . <p> Sprites are great tool when used wisely ( as is any tool ) . When reading the comments I see many people concerned about what will happen when the text is resized . Well , most modern browsers do page zoom by default and most users wo n't change that . A few pixels extra padding between the images wont hurt either . <p> There are places where sprites are not applicable - we often use sliding doors for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ combined with other images . <p> Also , some people suggest using the data : protocol to embed the images into the css , but this will have negative effect if one image is used more the once , or if the images are big . Remember , the image data is base64 encoded , so it adds 30% to 50% to the actual file size . <p> @Dave Joyce - " I tried using PNG Thing on an image and did n't see any change . It was a small 1x50 graphic saved with PNG-24 . " <p> Well , you 're not going to see a ton of saving on an image that small . Try something in the 500x500 range perhaps . Ive crushed 16k down to 12k , which yes , was around the same size as an equivalent GIF , but the GIF was 64 colours and the PNG was 24-bit . <p> @everyone worried about scaling - with a bit of clever coding , you absolutely can get these scaling vertically . MobileMe is probably a bad example of this , but see Dave Joyces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a box with rounded corners for a few ideas . <p> Both horizontal and vertical at once might be a bit trickier , granted . <p> I actually put together a 10 minute video explaining how to implement CSS Sprites for hover effect reasons . <p> This is probably is a no brainer to the mezzoblue visitors , but for newbies or beginners trying to wrap their heads around CSS in general , but to use sprites I created this video : http : //www.csslessons.com - How to use CSS Image Sprites in 10 Minutes ! <p> Future videos will be done slower , have better explanations , etc but this was my first video so cut me some slack lol : ) <p> Some of the problems would be solved if they updated css to cover the sprite technique and make it work more like actual sprites on old game systems like the N.E.S. ( and then of course for browsers to actually support it ) <p> We would n't need to " Have one image per row " or " leave room between each " or " have the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 'd write some " variables " ( or something ) in css to indicate a range within the image that should be treated as if it were its own image file . The browser would basically copy/paste those areas of the image into memory as separate images . Then there would be no worries about undesired areas of the master image showing up in the wrong place . <p> Alternatively , we could maybe save such images in a single special zip file that the browser would unpack into separate files and make accessible to to us in a special way : <p> Its funny that you mention the Yahoo Developer Network I have been trying to get as creative as possible with use of sprites over the years to minimize HTTP requests . As a Linux user , I have plenty of powerful command-line tools to assist in compression and optimization . However , Yahoo themselves have put out a web application for this very purpose that is greatly overlooked and underused , Smush.it ( http : //www.smushit.com/ ) , which Yahoo themselves seem to not promote much . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certainly is a good idea to do . <p> but on second thought , a lot of the graphics we use are small icons that indicate the type of a link with unpredictable length ( e.g. pdf links , external links , etc ) . this would result in having to use big spaces between the icons in the graphics , resulting in big file sizes . got any better idea ? <p> Just a warning for everyone using this technique . Page-zoom in Firefox sometimes shows a line of pixels of a neighboring sprite . <p> For example . When going to a google result page and zooming to 110% there are three gray lines at the bottom right . A was wandering what these were . After some checking it seems the google logo image also contained other UI elements . <p> I 'm not sure if its a Firefox ( Mac ) only problem , or that other browser have the same problem . <p> So when using this technique be sure to add some space between the sprites . <p> Ive been using this method for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ navigation where I might use images instead of selectable text , and the negative margin technique to kick the link text out . I mainly did this because with navigation styling that uses images , sometimes there 's that split second where the hover image does n't  appear immediately , regardless of how well you 've optimized your images for the web . <p> I 'm a little hesitant to jump into it for everything but Im glad Gerben pointed out the page-zoom issue for Firefox . I have a habit of adding some " safe space " between my sprites regardless . I guess as a failsafe . <p> Regardless , this is a fantastic technique . CSS background positioning is one of my favorite methods and I 've been using it a lot more for recent endeavors and experiments . Its nearly bulletproof from all the examples Ive seen and put into motion . <p> " File size is n't the only factor , each image is called with a separate HTTP request , and the more of those you have the longer your site takes to load " <p> This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the HTTP server can get a Content-Length for them so you 'll usually have all of your images pipelined through the same persistent HTTP connection . <p> Assuming of course that your graphic files werent cached anyway . This is actually a reason NOT to use sprites ; if you were to change one portion of the image , the whole collection would be invalidated in cache , and everyone would have to download it again . <p> That is n't to say it is n't a valid technique , but I believe the benefits from CSS Sprites in webpages come from rollovers , and when you need to swap one image out with another quickly . It takes more work to swap an image than it does to change a cropping view of the same image . <p> Its very dangerous to have a rule of " use sprites always " . Know what you 're doing , and you 'll avoid pitfalls . <p> I think that having several sprites broken up into groups of functionality or sections is fine . You end up with about 10-15 images on a canvas and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " effect you mentioned . I usually break things up into items for navigation ( cold , warm , hot states ) , forms , widgets/boxes , and some times other tertiary items like bullets and lines . This seems to provide the most flexibility for me . <p> Im interested to read that link you mention about the iPhone issues . iPhone is becoming a more prominent word on my lips these days . Great discussion ! : - ) <p> Also , for cheap ( albeit limited ) hover effects , do n't  forget about the easy option of simply changing the background color of an element containing an image with some transparency . For example , a GIF or PNG with some transparent pixels will naturally reveal the background color of its parent elements wherever it has transparency . So instead of switching out an *image* on hoverthus requiring two images ( or a larger sprite ) you can just change a BG color on hover . <p> You can also create some interesting effects by layering multiple images ( or the same image ) that contain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other user input . <p> Does anyone know how google looks at sprites in regards to search engine optimisation ? Will it push a site higher up in the rankings , or lower it ? Are they compatible with all types of browsers and mobile phones ? <p> I would n't go out of my way to create a sprite for the entire website . That simply is too much effort for very little return . <p> That said , sprites are an absolute must for : <p> 1 . Websites that use menu images 2 . Web application interfaces ( think FCKeditor ) 3 . High traffic websites where speed of content delivery and bandwidth is essential ( if your website is still running on a shared server , then no , you do not need to do this yet ) <p> MobileMes sprites are expressly designed to scale horizontally , not vertically . We do n't  use boxes , but we do use buttons ( and lots of them in various states : default , focus , active , disabled ) and a button size that 's capable of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ key with such huge sprites is making sure they 're documented very thoroughly , so that you can just look it up in a PDF and have all the information and coordinates right there by your side . <p> I agree with Dennison . If a site is n't going to have much traffic ( the majority of the brochureware I do for local companies ) , I try to avoid creating one sprite map . <p> But you should still combine normal+hover images , so there is no delay . I 've made an easy to use PhotoShop script to combine two images that I use all the time along with a script that extends the bottom pixel 50 pixels which is great for background text based navigational elements that *might* have two or more lines instead of just one line . With many of the CMS driven sites I design for , there 's no way to tell how much text is going to be in the menu name . <p> I was using this technique for quite sometime , and I found in recent times it is by far the best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ article loved the MobileMe bit , never noticed they took it a step forward ! Thanks ! <p> I just so happen to come across your post searching for something else , but I 'm glad I did . This to me , imho is a really snazzy technique . Thanks ! <p> @Bryan Kohlmeier Thanks for the video ! . I actually implemented it on a site that I am building . I started with a simple menu that gives the impression of a colored arrow on mouse over . <p> Overall I like this style of design due to the efficiency it can provide . Someone above had mentioned about extra work for them to get it configured , but all I can say is when was it about what you , as a webmaster , had to do and not about the end users ? Shame on you for that one ! <p> Now , I hope the site provides followups , because I like what I am reading . <p> @Jamie Hill quoted : " This is very effective , I have used the general idea in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ works with fluid sites . The MobileMe example gets around the width issue but what about height when text scales ? " <p> My thoughts on how to achieve this would be to have your repeating graphic faded with a solid color below it . Have that in the actual sprite , do not use background-color because of course we know that will not work as the image will cover the background color . So in the sprite you will just have to be sure to create enough of a buffer with that solid color . On a header for example , I would n't suspect that anyone would be increasing their font size to 200px or anything to crazy , so the repeating image does not need to be super long on the sprite . I think that would work . <p> @Stuart I agree with some posts that the most important benefit is the avoidance of flickering menus . And furthermore , grouping certain related images to one sprite is also more logical and keeps your web folders nice and tidy : ) <p> For performance issues , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't  have an idea of whether sprites are an improvement there . <p> But I can recall something of building sprites with a fixed size ( in pixels ) : 1x1 , 2x2 , 4x4 , 8x8 , 16x16 , 32x32 etcetera . A PC loads these formats better than something like 215x38 , but I 'm not totally sure about it . Can anyone she 'd light on this theory ? <p> I have used the method described here , and if you 're using Photoshops smart objects , its really easy to save a psd that has all the cuts while still able to be edited afterwards . Its really not that much more effort than making the actual cuts themselves . <p> No one likes flickering loaded images . I think sprites are a must must must . <p> I found using one large image for large , high traffic sites makes editing and maintaining images easier to deal with . If not ONE large image , at least a few separated out in groups of items that are related to each other ( like nav , forms etc ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ png/gif . Rather than updating multiple images , its just one , and if I do need to be sending images to someone or to copy files there are fewer to worry about : ) 30455 @qwx890455 30451 @qwx890451 <p> You are reading " Sprite Optimization " , an entry posted on 27 January , 2009 , to the Misty collection .

@@99593459 @3793459/ <p> Does anyone spot a trend ? Neither do I. The releases are happening in seemingly completely random order , without much concern to the traditional consumer and pro lines . So Apples charging away at the transition , regardless of the lineup . Great . <p> Except for those of us who want to buy new technology right now . See , Adobe has seemingly committed to not porting existing software ( meaning both CS2 and Studio 8 here , remember ) to MacIntel . Instead were going to have to wait for the next versions , which , given the current product cycle , means we 've got a year or two to wait it out . <p> Yes , you can run the existing software in emulation mode , but it ai n't  quick . Its hard to justify shelling out now for a speed decrease , when the actual benefits wo n't kick in for another year or more . <p> here 's the big dilemma for Mac-based creative professionals looking for new gear at the moment : buy a G5-based system now and get the speed boost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few years time . Or , buy an Intel-based system now , take a short-term speed hit , and be assured that your system will live on well after the transition is finished . <p> Of course , with the PowerMacs you do n't  even have the choice , the Intel versions havent been announced yet . And there 's another variable : youd need to stick it out until they arrive , and buy then . Anyone needing new gear right away is going to get stuck with a very tough choice . <p> I 'd been thinking about a PowerMac lately myself , but this issue made the decision a lot harder . I was all set to pick up a quad-core G5 at some point in the very near future , until I started seeing the Intel benchmarks . I had assumed the G5s would still out-pace the Intel chips for the first generation or two , but it sounds like the new chips are way faster already when running Universal binaries . So that does n't  help the matter . <p> Right now , I cant see any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot of money for something guaranteed to be obsolete within a few years . At the same time , I cant really justify laying out the same amount of cash for a system guaranteed to chug away for the next year or more . So PowerMacs just do n't  make sense until Adobes on board . <p> I realized that , just as Apple is in the middle of a transition , I guess I 'll have to be as well . So I ended buying a 20 " iMac G5 . Its cheap , its got a nice big screen , and even with the stock 512MB of RAM ( which will get maxed out in short order ) its already running circles around my Powerbook . <p> When it makes more sense to jump into the world of MacIntel , I 'll do it . But a week in , I 'm not regretting this move one bit . I can always sell it when its time to move on , but I already suspect itll be hard to get rid of . <p> Word of advice though : if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one yesterday . It seems Apple is putting them to bed rather quickly , to the point where mine may have come from the very last shipment of iMac G5s to the local Mac outlet . <p> Thanks for the article Dave , I 've been pondering myself lately on getting a Mac though my only concern is about being able to check cross-platform compatibility on my web applications . Mac Safari and others are gaining ( slowly ) market share and I think its important . To this point I 've relied on gecko-friendly code to be sufficient for Mac browsers , but I do n't  think that 's enough anymore . <p> My plan is to buy a new mac-mini with a dualcore intel , and hook that and my PC up with a KVM switch . That I think is cost-effective and should serve me well enough for now . What do you think ? <p> The G5 iMac sounds like a good choice to me in your situation . If you need knew kit , particularly from Apple , youve just got to bite the bullet and go for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little more . <p> I 'm really happy with my 8 month old Powerbook right now - should see me out for another year and then I 'll move over to a MacBook thingy . Of course , I 'm not a heavy user of any of that Adobe software , so it does make my decision slightly easier ! <p> Incidentally , nice meeting you in London a while back . Ca n't wait to hook up again at @Media ! <p> You 're right , its a lot of money for something thatll be obsolete in two years , but is n't that always the case . Any new Mac is awesome for a year , average for a year , and then obsolete . For me its more about software , there 's no reason to buy until adobes stuff runs native . Of course apple realizes this , and that why the towers will be the last to transition . <p> I always find it amusing when people worry about a new computer going obselete in a couple years when they are looking to buy . It seems to me that you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need and not what kind of speed you can get at some point in the future . If the current PowerMac G5 is fast enough for your needs , then get it . If it is n't then wait for something that is fast enough that also suits your software compatibility needs . <p> If you were considering buying a new PowerMac G5 before you realized how much faster the Intels were , why should thhe speed of the Intels affect your decision . Shouldnt your decision simply be whether or not the G5 is fast enough , and not how much faster another computer is if that other computer does n't  fit your needs ? <p> If you always wait to buy because something faster is on the horizon then you would never get a new computer . At the rate that technology is progressing , there will never be a good time to buy a new computer without the risk of it going obselete before you get it out of the box . <p> I just picked up an Intel iMac Core Duo 20 " and I could n't be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rev.b ) . <p> Yes , Photoshop is not a speed demon on this machine , but for web work its completely , totally usable . I just did a full round of site mockups on this machine over the weekend and it was a tad slower than my Powerbook ( a G4 1.5ghz 15 " ) . If you 're pushing print or gigantic print files then it might be an issue ( I did n't  test this ) but for most other tasks its great . <p> That said , I have 2G of ram in this machine , but I do n't  see the point in buying a brand new , top of the line machine and not maxing out the ram . <p> I guess it comes down this : all of the other applications I use constantly ( both development-related and otherwise ) are universal and *very* fast , and the ones that are n't  universal yet either run really well ( FontExplorerX , Word ) or run well enough ( Photoshop , Illustrator ) that its fine for me . Obviously mileage will vary - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ web designer / amateur photographer , but perhaps I 'm an anomaly . <p> I recently got a 20 " iMac Core Duo at work . ( replaced a Dual 2.0 PowerMac G5 .. so I can evaluate the Intel machines for possible deployment ) <p> Its a really nice machine . One big improvement over the iMac G5 is in the video card . It has the Radeon x1600 instead of the Radeon x600 .. and I ordered mine with 256 MB of VRAM , and of course the new iMac can drive a second display , instead of just mirroring the built-in display . ( My only complaint is that they 're using their stupid mini-DVI port . That makes sense on a laptop , but on a desktop machine ? Grr. stupid unnecessary adaptor . ) <p> Admittedly I rarely run photoshop , but the machine performs extremely well for me . Native programs feel nearly as fast as they were on the Dual G5 . Some things are much faster . There are a few minor annoyances ( the inability to run screen savers or preference panes in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Binary web browser plugins ) but I imagine those will be fixed over time . <p> I still do n't  see why people are worried about the G5 becoming obsolete . Hell , the G3 can still run Tiger today , and my 7-year old G4 tower , too . The panic is exaggerated " G5s will still be supported for at least another 5 years or so , certainly another two system revisions anyway , <p> you know , i got an imac g5 xmastime , just before the new ones were released . i couldnt be happier with my sexy new computer . i knew there would be bugs , so i 'm in no big rush to switch over , and by the time i AM ready to make the big switch , so will be Mac . its actually easily my favorite computer ever . glad you like yours too . <p> Okay , a few of you are confusing obsolesence with speed increases . When I say obsolete in this case , I mean the new Intel PowerMacs have a completely different processor architecture . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Made for Intel Macs on software , and that 's it . End of the road for the G5 . <p> If it were a simple matter of speed increases , I would be more at ease buying a G5 tower right now . But were talking about actual end of life for the usefuleness these systems . <p> Garrett : just for web testing , I 'd go for the cheapest Mac you can get . A second-hand mini would probably be your best bet . An iMac G3 should do , spec-wise , for your purposes , but you 've got the potential of the screen going wrong ( unlike the mini ) , and at some point soon the G3 might not be supported by OS X ( although that 's just my personal unsupported speculation ) . <p> I purchased a Mac mini for my wife literally three days before the Intel minis were announced . I had a clue it was coming , but I did n't  care . <p> Truth is , she needed a machine that she could do email and browse the web on . That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if the new machines are 4 times as fast . <p> Now , for those of us who need to run Adobe apps , there is quite a quandry . Unfortunately , Adobes apps are n't  written in Xcode . This makes creating a universal binary a little more troublesome and time consuming . <p> However , I think that the land of limbo could hurt Apples hardware sales . But I do n't  see Apple in a panic sending a bunch of engineers to Adobe to port CS over . <p> I think the order of release was like this because they needed a boost to the PowerBook line , and from there , the consumer line made more sense because of just this reason . Pros might hold back and wait for Adobe . <p> oh , and as for reasons to release them in this order the PowerMac and Xserve are going to be last . Because they need something better than a Core Duo . ( I imagine Apple is waiting on one of Intels 64-bit chips ) .. also , they 're probably hoping that something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ G5 emulation for Rosetta would be good for the few 64-bit apps out there .. I imagine that 's coming someday ) <p> Why the MacBook Pro before the iBook ( or possibly named MacBook ) ? Because it would look really bad for the consumer model to be significantly faster than the Pro model . And the new iBook will almost certainly be faster ( for Universal Binaries , at least ) than the PowerBook G4 . Also , getting the higher margin laptop out first means they may pick up some extra " Pro " sales from people who do n't  want to wait on the consumer model . <p> I think you should try and track down a Intel based Mac and try using one . Ive been using Photoshop for the past week or so on a 2.0Ghz Dual Core iMac , and I do n't  find it painful to use in the least . ( Mind you , I am upgrading from a G3 800Mzh iBook , so that might bias me in the new computers favour . ) You may find the real world usage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use will be much faster . <p> Im having the same problem you are , except I 'm a PC user . I never really switched to PC . Its an odd thing to describe . I always wanted a Mac for myself ( my dad had bought quite a few for his business throughout the years starting with the Mac II ) , but I never could afford it . I just built myself my own PC and have sort of suffered because of it . When I went to college I was able to get a Powerbook through scholarship money . I love that thing to death . <p> I think this move hurts people who are on limited budgets , but want to purchase a very nice Mac computer every few years . I have plans to buy myself a PowerMac , but I do n't  want to buy one until Adobe releases their software for the new Intel Macs . I would also like to have Corel release a new version of Painter for Mactel , but I 'm not sure if they have any plans for it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months between versions . I do n't  remember when CS2 was released .. April last year ? It would be October this year ( if my estimate is correct ) at the least for a new version to be released . I 'd love to ditch my PC as my primary computer before then , but I 'm having to wait because of Adobe . If I buy an iMac I wont have the money to purchase a PowerMac when the time comes , so I 'm having to sit and wait unfortunately . <p> Everybody seems to be having the same dilemma . Personally , I 've decided to stick it out another year or so with my PowerBook . Once Adobe comes through , I 'm hoping to also buy a 2nd iteration of the MacBook Pro , hopefully without all of the bugs that come with 1st iterations . <p> I got the Intel iMac and it runs all the Adobe apps more than fast enough for me ( under Rosetta ) . Its faster than my Powerbook G4 for sure ( but not quite as fast as the Dual Powermac G5 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wont be releasing their native versions anytime soon , but in the meantime , Rosetta runs the Adobe suite quite nicely . <p> I own a 20 " G5 iMac at home and I use a 20 " Intel Core Duo iMac at work . They 're both fantastic machines , and for anything non-adobe , the intel mac works fantastic , but I admit , if I can , I save my photoshop work for home when its easier and simpler and faster to run it on the g5 there . <p> Dave , I think you made the right move . That g5 imac is a cheap way to get a fast , wonderful and powerful machine . If you have lots of print design work to do , or just need photoshop all the time , then the g5 is the way to go . Even with the intel macs out now , its a terrific value . <p> You can take the money you saved and give it to adobe in a year when they charge us for the intel versions of their apps . <p> Jeff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Powerbook G4 , then you have n't been spoiled by a g5 , and as speed tests show , the Photoshop on Rosetta on Intel ends up being about the same speed or a little faster than on the Powerbook . <p> I 'm going to do an apples-to-apples ( ahem ) comparison in a few weeks , when the 17 " iMac G5 iSight at work goes to a coworker and I get its immediate replacement , the 17 " iMac Core Duo . At least that 's the plan . <p> I think Dave made a smart move here , because the iMac G5 runs his daily bread Photoshop very , very well ( at least in my experience ) , and will be a great machine even down the line as a second computer or for someone else ( wife , friend , or third-party buyer ) once the pro-level Intel desktop Macs come out and , importantly , have been revved at least once , and Adobe gets their ducks in a row . <p> Plus the iMac is probably the sexiest personal computer out there right now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how I can treat it like a luggable laptop just unplug , grab the keyboard and mouse in one hand and the screen in the other , and go to another room . I 've even used it for presentations by putting it in a rolling suitcase . If you do n't  need a battery , it makes a very nice transportable PC : <p> The whole G5 vs Intel transition is a case of damned if you do , damned if you do n't  . In terms of pro apps , such as Adobe CS3 , waiting would really depend upon the eventual feature set of these apps , and whether there 's any features in the new suite you cant see yourself living without . It also depends on the frequency with which you replace your hardware . <p> After my experiences with the first model G3 blue and white model and the horror stories of the first model Ti Powerbooks ( I bought the second model ) . I would wait for the second model of the MacIntel . I am waiting until at least the first MacIntel ibooks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> I do n't  want to replace it with a G4 powerbook or G4 ibook , because my current Powerbook lasted 5 years and I would like the same life span for my next laptop . And will Apple , Adobe and others still be supporting the G4 chip as well as they support the Intel chip , during the last years of that laptops life . <p> I 'm with Jon Henshaw on this one . My current g4 powerbook , whilst not being a speed demon , still does everything ive ever needed it to do . I 'm happy to wait until Adobe come out with UB and purchase a 2nd ( or maybe even 3rd ) revision MacBook Pro at that point in time . <p> With the current top of the line MBPs actually topping out marginally faster than the iMac in terms of CPU power ( 2.13ghz ) I am expecting good things when I finally get a new Mac . <p> I guess it depends how long in the tooth your current machine is getting and if its doing what you need or not . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mac seemed fine until Apple announced that the new was faster and then it literally seemed slower to him ! ! <p> As far as Adobe/Macrobe goes , I 'm quite disappointed by Photoshop CS for Mac OS X. Does n't  it bug anyone here that when Photoshop CS crashes , the file you were working on reverts to the previous saved state ? Adobe does n't  use any of the *nix goodness available on Os X. When Apple Works crashes , I can recover my file in the state just before crash . I mean *Apple Works* Maybe its different on CS 2 . Is it ? I remember Dave posting on his lack of enthusiasm for this upgrade , the ability to recover files would be a reason to upgrade . <p> Meanwhile I have no great hopes for Photoshop for MacIntels . Porting to XCode might give Adobe the opportunity to *get it right* this time , but they might be too busy porting quick and dirty to take time for that . <p> This few years is just about the normal lifecycle of a computer system these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel great about my dual 2.7Ghz G5 I got half a year ago . I know it will serve me well for at least 2 years to come . If a G4 is still fast enough for many people I 'm sure as hell a dual G5 will do it for me for quite a while . <p> The only thing I see that does NOT make sense right now is purchasing Adobe CS2 for Mac licenses . You know you 'll have a piece of software that will run totally shitty on the shiny new Intel Mac you 'll buy in three years time . <p> " It 's a lot of money for something guaranteed to be obsolete within a few years . " <p> The same could be said about any computer . Amiga 2000 / 3000 / 4000 / AmigaONE . PowerMac 603 / G3 / G4 / G5 . Windows on 286 / 386 / 486 / Pentium etc . They are/were all guaranteed to be obsolete within about ten minutes . The same is true of cars , mountain bikes , washing machines <p> I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but as a Windows user , I find it unbelievable that Apple are yet again , releasing systems and an OS that are natively incompatible with current software . <p> They already did this when they went from OS 9 to OS X , where if you wanted to run any 9 software in X you had to run it through an emulated version of 9 ( classic ) which is a pain for anyone , not to mention slower . <p> At least with Windows , when new versions come out , 90% of your software will still work . I just ca n't understand why Apple decided to make all old software completely incompatible with OS X , and now their doing it again ! It seems like the best way possible to discourage users from upgrading , absolutely ridiculous . <p> Once the new inventory of G5 iMac systems are gone , refurbished systems from the Apple Store will still be an easy option for at least a year or so . Its worth it to think about a refurbished especially if you are buying a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Steve has said that the enter line will be Intel by the end of the year ( 2006 ) . So we may have the Pro desktop line fairly soon . <p> The Apple Store refurbished inventory can be found in most countries by going into the base ( web ) Apple Store , a looking for a red Special Deals graphical link on the lower right hand corer of the page . ( Additionally , I track this inventory at my site . ) <p> " Here 's the big dilemma for Mac-based creative professionals looking for new gear at the moment : buy a G5-based system now and get the speed boost for the short term , thus facing obsolesence in a few year 's time . Or , buy an Intel-based system now , take a short-term speed hit , and be assured that your system will live on well after the transition is finished . " <p> There is one more choice - for the same price is very limited singlecore G5 you can buy dualcore Intel/AMD PC with Windows XP , and enjoy Adobe CS2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picked up a Dual 2Ghz G5 just after the announcement of the Intel switch . Justification : I like how the current apps run on one ( I have the same machine at work ) and worse case scenario - if the switch does not go smoothly , I have a machine I am happy with , til I find something else to do . ( looks like my rational was not too far off . ) <p> I also wanted a laptop really bad for a couple of years . I was one of those holding out for a G5 version . Well , out comes the MacBook Pro and the announcement by Adobe that there would be no apps in the near future . Solution : I bought a Pentium M ( 1.73Ghz ) Acer for $699 after rebate . Justification : CHEAP CHEAP CHEAP - and I only needed it for 2 things . 1 ) surf the web from different locations in the house - it does that . 2 ) need to do Actionscript work in the same room as wife - wintels run Flash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ popular decision , and I have never owned a Wintel machine before . I have to say , it works good , and it will get me through a year or more till all this ends up figured out . <p> Although very eager to switch from pc to mac for some time now ( ever since I got a second hand iMac bondi blue , dating back to 98 , for testing purposes ) I 'm gon na restrain myself some more : I 'm relying on Abode/adobe-macromedia products for most of my work , so its crucial to my switch to mac . If by then well have a clearer view on what direction the adobe bundles will be going in the future , itll be an added bonus . <p> Ive been thinking of buying the new iMac as well - itll be my first Apple . I 'm not too concerned about running Photoshop or Illustrator because I use them primarily for layouts and basic photo editing - and with 2GB or RAM I 'm sure that Rosetta will perform ok . My only concern is that I wont be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ IE ( I 'm plannig on ditching the PC completely ) . Will the Firefox IE tab extension suffice for this ? Or can anyone tell me of a fast , free service thatll alow me to look at projects a la Internet Explorer ? <p> As for what mac to get - well get what you can afford and what does what you now want it to - guess what ? My week 50 2003 Dual 2ghz G5 is still way fast enough for me . Would I like faster ? Sure , do I need faster well that 's open to hand-wringing and navel gazing . <p> If I needed a new mac I think my use of InDesign and Photoshop would probably say " go PowerPC " but Apple had to get in and force the change and hope software cos felt the heat and got busy . Quark on OS X anyone ? <p> All this hilights the value of open source software . We can avoid this whole mess if we had a set of platform-independent tools that we did n't  have to pay $3,000 per license @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but it works on every machine out there and you can bet that it will be optimized for both the old Motorola/IBM and the Intel chips . <p> There are other solid open source apps out there .. but instead of ranting I 'll just direct you to http : //www.openedpc.com for a short list . <p> I 've had the same problem with the Apple/Adobe issue . I am still using a PowerMac G4 , and have been looking forward to upgrading to a PowerMac G5 , but then htey announced they were switching to Intel , so I held off , and now I 'm going to have to wait for Adobe to port all their software , so I 'm just going to wait until the next version of Creative Suite and then I 'll get the new Mac+Adobe software <p> My other concerns ( maybe a little off-topic ) is whether my upgrade path will still exist to upgrade to CS3 from CS2 especially if they plan on merging CS with some Macromedia products like Dreamweaver/Fireworks . <p> Anyway , the Mac-mini looks like it may be a good option since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over my 1.2Ghz G4 I 've got 2 19 " LCDs though so hopefully they will hook up to the mini <p> This is all very interesting . I just dealt with this yesterday and happened on this entry today , after the fact but it reinforces my decision to get a non-intel chip mac . I use Adobe software pretty exclusively and seeing the performace losses on Rosetta helped me decide to purchase a PPC instead . The benchmarks on Mac World using photoshop really cemented things for me . <p> I junked my Mac along time ago and switched to a whole new type of hell called Dell but still use the Penitum chips because they rock ! Was so glad to hear Adobe bought Macromedia and can not wait for a new release of software from Abode featuring Macromedia intergrated technology . <p> I could n't agree with you more . I just shelled out for a MBP 3 days ago , and read your article ( among others ) and had to call and cancel the order . I ended up purchasing a PBG4-17 " instead . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question not to mention a very standard MacBook Pro cancellation reply and I could n't help but think , " man , they must be getting an awful lot of those . " My order was immediately cancelled and I was sent to the product page for a fully loaded PBG4-17 " . I did n't  want to give up my 17 " widescreen anyway . Ill probably have enough to get the MBP-17 " when it comes available and by then well probably have more Universal apps . <p> There is no reason to upgrade to a slower machine . If the Intel machine offers post-emulation better performance than your current system , then I would say go Intel . If not , buy Motorola . A reasonable half-life of any modern computer is approximately 18 months . After that there will be new high-end applications that it will not be able to run . I do not foresee Intel-only must-have applications in the immediate future . <p> If you absolutely need cutting edge you will be buying a new machine around the same time as the Intel Mac becomes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to now , do not upgrade . I have a 3 year old PC and I have yet to find a program that it can not run efficiently . I use an " old " G4 Mac , and it can also handle any application that I need . As soon as that fact changes I will upgrade , but until then it would be a waste of money . When I do upgrade , the equipment available then will out perform the equipment available today ; thus I will get more out of my investment . <p> As a financially strapped college student I this is my best option ; but then my Mac is not my livelihood . <p> Tim Buchheim is right : Apple is waiting for Intel to release Conroe for use as a G5 replacement . The Core Duo would simply be inadequate in this situation , particularly for using Adobes apps under Rosetta . ( FWIW , Adobe have recently announced their intention to deliver universal binaries , as CS3 , before years end . ) <p> Test releases of Conroe have recently taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commercial release should happen around August 2006 . Hmm , what else is happening around that time hmmm ah , that 's right , Apples developer conference , strangely pushed back a month or two from its normal timeslot . <p> is that Quad G5 really guaranteed to be obsolete in a few years ? Do n't  forget that most ( if not all ) software from here on out will be released as a Universal Binary , so it will run on both PowerPC and Intel hardware for many years to come . Do n't  forget how long it took people to ditch Classic . Mac developers are writing code for a pretty small market as it is , so i 'm sure they will not hesitate to go to the extra trouble of making every one of their apps available for the bleeding-edge IntelMac owners and the PowerPC holdouts who will keep their machines for several more years . <p> With this information in mind , I think buying a Quad G5 is a great idea . If the software wont be native on Intel for a while , why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Intel stuff look way faster , but most of the non-Apple benchmarks have been showing gains that are nowhere near what Apples PR people would have you believe . <p> The bottom line : if you really needed the power right now , you 'd have ordered the Quad G5 last week ! The Intel transition is going to take several years to fully play out . If you really need the hardware right now , just get the fastest thing you can buy , which will also run all of your existing software the Quad G5 . If that seems like a bad idea , maybe you do n't  really need the power that badly anyway . <p> Remember , to be a Mac fan is to play a waiting game with Apple . Just get what you need right now and do n't  regret it . <p> I feel confident that Mac OS 10.5 will be Universal and I would n't be surprised if 10.6 still supports PowerMacs that can run 10.4 , but certainly within five years we will see software that will be for MacIntel only ( I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two years of the transition . ) Upgrade form G4 to CoreDuo , no question ( that 's why the MacBook Pro was so early in the transition ) . G5 vs CoreDuo = dilemma . <p> /******************** quote So here 's where we 're at on announced MacIntel computers right now : we 've got the MacBook Pro , the Mac mini , and the iMacIntel. /******************** quote off <p> Well , with the exception of the iBook , there is a trend though ; ) Its all mobile-based . Because of heat/powercomsumtion , +nd because a lot of consumers tend to buy a PowerBook/Mac BookPro anyways , the current line of Intel-based Macs is pretty good I think . <p> I 'm not entirely sure why Apple did n't  have an Intel-iBook ( Mac Book ? ) yet , but perhaps that 's because of an overall redesign for a 13 " version . I cant tell but eitherway , its mostly a consumerbased setup instead of a business-based trend . And what better way to test your new product then in real life ? If Apple would use the business-section @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complaints . <p> I 've recently gone for the MBP and am still waiting on it arriving . I 'm a heavy user of Photoshop and Illustrator so this is a big concern . The benchmarks look awful so the machine might well be going back ! <p> It is a little annoying that Apple did n't  explicitly tell users this . I do n't  think it is fair for Apple to point fingers at Adobe and vice versa . It leaves the consumer stuck in the middle . <p> just learning macromedia ( loving it ) discovered zen and this article . i have had rare exposure to macs , my boss ( rabid mac afficionado ) has been very helpful with mac research and am looking to purchase . given the information displayed here , i am sometimes confused , followed by a moment of clarity . i am sensing that an imac g5 would be a good machine for me so that i can get away from the pc based craziness and move over to mac any other suggestions ? <p> Even if you bought an Intel based Mac @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ported there will be much more powerful Intel processors available . So either way you are looking at a new purchase in a few years . <p> Maybe buy a PC and use that for a few years before going back to Mac ? I KID ! I KID ! <p> here 's a solution - buy a PC , but wait until later this year when they release Vista which will look as pretty as a Mac , along with all the more functional improvements . <p> Last year I bought a Mac mini , which was pretty cheap and allows me to test pages on Safari and Camino , I do n't  use it for anything else though , even though my background is in Art and Graphic design Ive never liked Macs because compared to PCs they 're much less for your money , also , I find the Macintosh brand irritatingly pretentious . <p> I mean if you can get more power , storage , speed , flexibility , compatibility and maintainability for much less money , its a no-brainer . I find this situation with the Intel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I resigned from a job that provided me with PB 1.5Ghz PPC and I had this very debate of MBP vs PPC when I went to purchase my replacement laptop . I went back and forth reading lots of comments here ( thanks everybody ) as well as consulting friends and my wife . <p> In the end , I decided on a PB 1.67Ghz PPC because my main priority was to get a laptop that will allow me to keep working with my other clients . The deciding factors : ( 1 ) Software ( Adobe mainly ) for MBP is not there yet ; and ( 2 ) " If it ai n't  broke do n't  fix it " . <p> So that 's what I did . But I am sure I will get MBP once the software comes around <p> I 'm looking at moving from a couple year old Powerbook to the new MacBook . Even though the Intel processors running Photoshop are a bit slow , from my playing with a friends new iMac , I wont be going backwards in speed . Photoshop in Rosetta @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a 1.2GHZ G4 Powerbook . Same with Dreamweaver . <p> I had the same reservations about switching from OS 9 to OS X. It took the better part of a year before all the programs I had were X native . I lived through running Classic and I expect that I 'll live through Rosetta . <p> If I were looking at Video or Audio I would probably go with a G5 but for my web work , that 's overkill . <p> Hmmm , well this has me kinda worried now . You see I just got my self a new G5 and upgraded all my Adobe software . I really had no choice though because my last computer fried . I guess I 'll just have to take the hit , though I 'm not really looking forward to having to buy a new apple in a year or two when I thought this would last me at least three to five . Are we certain that Adobe wont be putting out some sort of transitional faze of their software to be a little easier on their customers ? <p> I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dual to use my RIP and drive my printer until the RIP is available in UB this summer ( it does n't  work at all on the MBP ) . It is blazing fast both with Mac OS X and UB apps ( BBEdit , Transmit , GraphicConverter , Omnigraffle etc. ) but chokes on Photoshop and Indesign . I find it really slow with both apps ( it is way better with AI , Golive and Acrobat ) that sport some bugs also ( ie numbers are stranglely rounded up , ending with huge decimals written in the transformation panel boxes ) . <p> And Rosetta is very very RAM hungry . <p> But I think Rosetta will be far more useable on a Desktop than on an iMac/MBP for this reason . I am pretty sure that Intel Mac desktops should alleviate Rosetta limitations in a big way ( more and faster memory available , more Intel cores to manage translation on the fly , faster disks and graphics on par with PCs should do wonder when CS3 will leverage CoreImage ) . Also , it is pretty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come , Rosetta will then have matured enough to suppress the bugs affecting Adobe apps . I really think that when next Apple pro desktop is available ( this summer ? ) you will be able to better judge of Rosetta impact and have a better idea of Adobe roadmap so as to choose more easily . <p> For nomads , that is another story : for me , it is too early to go both mobile AND Intelexclusively . <p> " At least with Windows , when new versions come out , 90% of your software will still work . I just ca n't understand why Apple decided to make all old software completely incompatible with OS X , and now their doing it again ! " <p> I 'm no expert but it seems to me that Apples drive to move forward whilst providing ability to run older software in emulation is the smart way to go . It could be said that Microsofts insistence on backwards compatibility is precisely what 's holding them back and delaying the release of Vista . <p> I have been buying mac products scince @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it still works today . I decided then , I would never go back to PC . <p> But I am now curious as to why apple would put a processor that is so easily hacked . Now the internet is full of stories of how XP runs naitively on macintel . And also the stories of OSX being hacked to run on generic PCs with intel chips . So I am left to wonder why not buy a well put together PC and put OSX on it . The PC market is larger and it is cheaper to replace hardware . Youd get the best of both worlds . Now this is not a hostile comment , I love my macs but I feel like if I buy a new one I 'd just be buying an overpriced PC . Anyone that can set me straight I 'd love to hear from you Cheers <p> I have been a PC user for years doing a bit of Photoshop and Dreamweaver in my spare time . It was time to upgrade and I thought it was time for a change so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to 2GB . I realised that there would most likely be a performance hit when using the current versions of both Photoshop and Dreamweaver though thought 2GB should do the trick . Unfortunately not when using both applications there is a noticable lack of responsiveness - just enough to be annoying . It is as if the program is half a step behind you . <p> Its too late to take it back to the Apple Store and to try and source a Power PC version . : ( I really hope Adobe release a new versions later this year as rumoured . <p> In the meantime I 'm going back to my trusty old PC as these apps run without the noticable response delay that occurs on my new Mac Mini . <p> I just installed this on a Intel iMac .

@@99593460 @3793460/ <p> They say the jet lags easier going west than east . Either way , 8 hours is a heck of a time difference . <p> I 'm back and ( mostly ) recovered from a week in London , and boy was it ever great meeting all of you who came out to the Carson Workshop , or the Skillswap in Brighton , or the Geek Dinner back in London . <p> Though it was my first time in the city , due to various suggestions and other circumstances I wont get into here , it seemed like a good time to pack the week with social events . The hallmark of a good trip is the quality of people you meet , and London had it in spades . <p> Without delving into the minutiae of each day , I 've mentally blocked out the trip into a few distinct chunks of days , which went a little something like this . <h> Carson Workshops <p> Of course , the main reason for going in the first place was to run a one day workshop with Carson Systems . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their ability of taking care of the little details , and making their guests feel like royalty . Seriously . Check out that hotel suite . It was unbelievable . <p> The first two days were preparation , mainly toward re-adjusting my body clock . I ended up going in completely sleep-deprived anyway , of course . Cest la vie . <p> The workshop itself went pretty well , I thought . A full day is a long time to get up and talk , but in the spirit of " its better to be over-prepared than under-prepared " I actually managed to run into time constraints . Now that 's a first for me . Feedback has been quite positive so far , I think it was a good experience for everyone . <p> What impressed me most were the questions and comments that came up later in the day . The last hour or so was pure Q&amp;A-style discussion , and questions being asked were reassuringly sophisticated and clued-in . Its great when really smart people come out , I end up learning a bunch myself . <h> Brighton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I had a reason to go to Brighton on Englands south coast , and a place to stay when I got there . <p> Andy runs an event for the local new media community called SkillSwap , and tendered the invite to come down and talk to the local crew . Jeremy and the lovely Jessica have opened their home to my fellow countrymen in the past , and so I found myself the lucky recipient of a night chez J&amp;J . <p> I think I 'll let Jeremy summarize the two days in Brighton , he s already covered everything I 'd have to say . Except for the Dave Shea/Dave Seah incident . <p> At some point Andy asked me if I had seen the " I Am Not Dave Shea " post . I had no idea what he was talking about , and during the SkillSwap , he loaded it up . <p> Now , I may be biased since it comes across as pretty complimentary , granted ( thanks Dave ) . But the real point is , my god is that ever a clever piece @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and from what I read later , my UK IP address at the time was enough to flag it as a bogus comment . Whoops . <h> Tourist <p> After Brighton , it was back up to London for a couple of days of playing the tourist . I managed to squeeze in lunch with Patrick Griffiths , but up until the geek dinner , it was non-stop sight-seeing . A brief list of what got crammed into two days : <p> Liecester &amp; Trafalgar Square <p> The latter amid the Sunday morning bells from the nearby St. Martins-in-the-Field . Great time to go visit , would n't want to live there . <p> St. Pauls Cathedral <p> I walked in during the first half of a Sunday morning service . The choir was singing totally acoustically , and the way it bounced around the vaulted ceiling was breathtaking . This was the highlight of the day for me , even though they do n't  allow photos/video . <p> The Tower of London <p> After reading Stephensons Baroque Cycle , it was an absolute must , despite the $30 CDN entrance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you 're into that sort of thing , Englands crown jewels are stored there as well . ( No pictures allowed of those either . ) <p> Big Ben / Parliament Buildings <p> I did n't  bother going inside any , but managed to get some nice evening shots along the waterfront and a few poor daylight shots . <p> Westminster Abbey <p> Worth the 10 admission , for the ornate decor , for the historical significance , and for the incredibly high dead kings per square foot ratio . Though I was never quite sure who was buried there , and who was simply memorialized . Cromwell ? Chaucer ? Tennyson ? Olivier ? I suspect its a little of the former , but most of the latter . Again . No photos . <p> The British Museum <p> The British Museum is an incredibly rich trove of world history , with artifacts from many important civilizations over the past 6000 years . Egyptian , Grecian , Roman , Chinese , Indian , and European to name a few . Anyone in the world can simply walk in and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cent . Theyve got the original Rosetta Stone , by the way . ( I did the Tate Modern as well , which I did n't  enjoy nearly as much . ) <p> There was much , much more , but those were the highlights . <h> Geek Dinner <p> And , finally , on my last night in town , I spent the evening with 60 or so of my new best friends . As alluded to earlier around these parts , Ian Forrester organized a superb Geek Dinner since I happened to be in town . Great times were had , beer was drunk , and I rambled on for a while about usability and Javascript and CSS and the like . There 's actually quite a good transcript out there , though its obviously not exact . Close enough for a crowded room with bad acoustics though . <p> Kudos to Ian for putting on such a great evening , and everyone else for coming out and saying hi , though I did n't  get a chance to talk to even half of you . The room was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hours <h> Overall <p> A fantastic trip . One of the best Ive done yet . As always , its the people that really make it , and without exception everyone I met in England was simply Good People . Now I cant wait for @Media . In the interim , I 'm pulling a Molly and jetting off again tomorrow for yet another event .

Sites change , URLs go missing , and all too often when I need to find something again I turn straight to Google ( prior Altavista , prior Yahoo ) . The half second it takes to save and categorize a page so I can come back to it later just never seemed to pay off . <p> Solutions that offer bookmark exporting , sharing and archiving do n't  feel like they 're solving anything . That 's too much conscious effort I 'd need to spend to save a list of links which may or may not be outdated when I need them . <p> A solution like TrailBlazer is what I 'd be interested in , were it simply an add-on to search my existing browsers history instead of a stand-alone browser . Searching an automatically-generated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than having to manually save each link I find useful . Anything I have n't been to in longer than my history covers does n't  need to take up space when I can find it ( or an equivalent ) on Google . <p> So because of my reluctance to take action myself , instead of bookmarks Ive learned to rely on auto-complete in the address field . All the shortcuts I 'd normally create as browser buttons instead get typed as fractional URLs , thanks to Safaris lightning-quick ability to fill in the most likely match . google.com has become g , mezzoblue.com has become mez , etc. etc . <p> In fact , auto-complete is becoming so ingrained I 've started clearing my history to influence what pops up . Occasionally a typo here and there will redirect my short strings elsewhere , or manually typing in a longer URL will override the short saved copy . Then its time to flush and re-build ; because the auto-complete buffers I rely on do n't  have that many enries , I can justify a total refresh . Its a light-weight , disposable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would n't advocate anyone else getting used to this way of finding things . This reluctance to use bookmarks highlights the problem with re-discovering local information . Google usually works just fine as my backup brain when I need to find a web resource . When it comes to information I know I 've seen but cant describe , my local tools just do n't  cut it . Spotlight looks great , but does it search the right things ? <p> My quest continues . I 'm sure there 's something out there that does this already , that will search local histories and resources to find recently-viewed information . In fact , I 'm sure I read about it recently . I just ca n't find it . 30451 @qwx890451 <p> You are reading " Re-discoverability " , an entry made on 24 August , 2004 , filed under " Usability/IA " . 
@@99593462 @3793462/ <p> When is an orange not an orange ? When someone colors it purple . I have learned more about copyrights and licensing in the past 24 hours than I ever thought I 'd need to . <p> This post is about the general issue . The specific dispute has been resolved , as the person I was quoting has both privately and publicly apologized and settled this in a way acceptable to me and hopefully all the Zen Garden authors . The funny thing about repentence is that it places the accuser in a spot of feeling guilty for doing the accusing in the first place , but I digress , and we 've moved on . <p> It would seem that Creative Commons is a tangle of worms , and the simple three-step process they offer when selecting a license is overly simplistic . Back in May when I evaluated CC and chose the license I did , I made sure to read the full legal code and did n't  find anything that I could n't agree with . Experience since has highlighted the problems with CC licenses in real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time : <p> Derivative Work is an undefined term . Technically , someone could grab any work governed by this license , modify a single pixel , and re-release it as their own derivative work , and that 's okay . <p> Attribution is an undefined term . The same person is not obligated to credit the original author visibly ; they could just bury their attribution in an obscure spot of the source file that no one but the most conscientious developer will ever see . <p> The license is definitive . You can not add terms on top of it . This effectively means you lose any control of your copyright beyond what Creative Commons affords . This is what I got tripped up on ; I assumed it was okay to further refine some points , considering I/we still owned the copyright on the original work . <p> The license is non-revokable . If someone chooses to do something with your work that you do n't  approve of ( think hate or porn sites here ) you 're out of luck . Worse : they have to attribute you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not associate it with you . Stew on that for a while , itll leave a bad taste in your mouth . <p> I wanted to keep things simple and open . To me , and to many of you , there are clear lines between fair use , respectable use , and outright theft . To others , there are n't  , and this is why things will have to change . <p> I want people to be able to use these . css files . I want them to learn from them , I want them to take the techniques within and produce new work with them . That 's how I and many others learned what we know , and I want to fully encourage it to continue . <p> But I do n't  want wholesale copying . Images or no , the designs are not templates . Zen Garden submitters are not spending their free time putting together work so that others may re-use and possibly profit from it . This , it would seem , is what some cant differentiate . There 's no license in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " and even if there were , the definition of " some " is too vague to be legally binding . <p> So , because of the few , the many once again suffer . I now have to spend the next few weeks refining a more specific license for the Zen Garden . The spirit of openness and learning will be preserved as far as it can , but since it was obviously too open to begin with , it will be much more restrictive . <p> None of us is glad to see it come to this . I think Michael said it best in this comment : <p> The sad part in all of this is the legalistic vantage points that everyone has to come from nowadays . <p> It ca n't just be about what 's proper , polite , courtious , considerate , correct , or nice . <p> It has to be about what the license says , what the offender feels entightled to , how far the offender feels he can go with it , what the letter of the law says can and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " oh sorry " , " hey , no problem " affair . Its got ta be " sorry bucko you lose , too bad " and " listen here you jerk " . Maybe I 'm just a little polly-anna but I expect better behavior out of people whether or not there 's a license covering that behavior . It saddens me that there are people out there so immature and so self-absorbed that they just cant understand it when people do n't  want to give them the world for free and act belligerent when people challenge them for that behavior. 30455 @qwx890455 30451 @qwx890451 <p> You are reading " Copywrong Revisited " , an entry posted on 10 September , 2003 , to the No 1 collection .

@@99593464 @3793464/ <p> There should not be a Browser Upgrade Campaign v2 , and something we might consider instead . <p> Reaction to the latest Internet Explorer news has been very onesided : this is a bad thing for developers , and we have to do something about it . Ive been meaning to gather my thoughts and post something more indepth , but that will have to be put on hold . <p> The BUC was a success because it aimed to move users off of ridiculously old browers . One of the suggested upgrades was Internet Explorer 6 , precisely the browser that will be targetted by this new campaign . <p> Repeating the same campaign would be disastrous for any credibility the web development community has garnered in the past few years . All the new campaign would serve to accomplish is to portray developers as whiny , neversatisfied ingrates who ca n't make up their mind about which browser the end user should use . The WaSPs efforts would be completely undermined . And what happens in 3 years when we have to start getting people off of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long-term on this . Destructive reasoning against IE is n't going to solve any of our problems , itll only work against us . Instead , let 's address why a user might want Opera , or Mozilla . Sell a new browser to them by luring , do n't  shame them into upgrading . <p> Start a marketing campaign . Run ads for the new browsers that point to how to upgrade pages . Play very nicely , and do n't  let any of the vitriol you 're prone to casting on IE creep into your efforts . <p> And for heavens sake , be thankful were even this far . Being stuck with IE6 for the next 7 years is way better than being stuck with NN4 . <p> My very first reaction on Friday was that in our day jobs , some of us have to use advertising and marketing techniques to sell our clients products . We 've got the collective skills , so why not use them to start selling highend browsers ? <p> Unfortunately my thinking has n't  progressed passed the basic inkling of an idea stage yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thoughts above . <p> But , as rough as it is , here 's my full pitch the Luxury Web Experience or something better worded . It would be an elegant site , with highend design that evokes imagery of hauteculture , jewellery stores , luxury cars , and so forth . Instead of making the hard sell , it would focus on the lifestyle that everyone wants , and the message would be a gentle you can have this if you download **25;630;TOOLONG <p> There would be some supporting documentation on the site , steps for installation and focusing on features , but the main page itself would only mention a few of the finer features , and let imagery and imagination sell the rest of it . <p> There would have to be a supporting ad campaign , which is where the rest of the development community can really lend a hand . <p> The first selling point , and one of the big ones because I 've had luck getting people to switch on this alone , is that you no longer have to put up with the annoyance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Very rough thinking , and I 'm sure some people will want to take a more pragmatic approach . But since we 've used up our shot at the hard sell , this is one direction wed be better off pursuing . <p> The market is changing . I run a web developer community , and since we started promoting the values of Firebird to people it has grown in popularity . It now shares 45% of our browser share . IE is still the biggest but it is droping in number each and every day . 
@@99593465 @3793465/ <p> Microsoft appears to have every intention of sacrificing the browser to do what they want to do . And were quick to assume that consumers are sheep , and will buy into whatever Microsoft foists on them . <p> I do n't  need a new OS . Do you ? 2000 and XP still work fine after the past few years , and will continue to work . This is bad news to Microsoft . Longhorn is a desperate move , because we genuinely do n't  care anymore . I do n't  care about the next version of Windows anymore than I care about the latest .2Ghz speed upgrade from Intel . I am a consumer , I speak with my wallet , and I say it simply is n't something I need to spend money on . <p> So if were stuck waiting for a browser upgrade in an operating system nobody is going to buy , then we are n't  going to get it . Don Park points out that the simple most effective way to deploy a new browser is bundling . That 's how Microsoft has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The consumer may not care about the browser , but they will continue to use the web . Consumers like it . And if they do n't  upgrade to Longhorn , the web stands still . I deal with clients that run Netscape 4 because theyve never bothered to upgrade . Because no one told them they should . <p> What if they start seeing messages on every third site they visit , telling them they should ? The messages are coming from an authoritative voice . Maybe they wont upgrade the first hundred or thousand times they see the message , but eventually they ca n't help but think its something they need to do . <p> And forget the web developer for a moment , the problem goes well beyond those who code front-end only . Web services need that front end . The browser that wins dictactes who can display what . If Microsoft controls this space , Google dies on their whim . See the potential ? <p> Maybe Google shouldbankroll Mozilla . Maybe everyone working with the web in one capacity or another should think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and their respective companies with any further monopoly . R.I.P . Netscape . Maybe its time for us all to band together . <p> Maybe the Luxury Web was premature , maybe its the wrong approach . But now that our suspicions have played out to the letter and worse in the past two months , maybe its time to quit watching what happens , and start doing . 30454 @qwx890454 <p> How about UNITED AGAINST MICROSOFT ? It has a nice ring in my book . Or maybe we should use their moniker - FREEDOM TO INNOVATE . Irony always has a certain appeal . <p> It really is frustrating to think that the world is so dependant ( or so apathetic ) that people do n't  mind the Microsoft monopoly that much . Its OK with the average user because the very concept of using another operating system is too daunting ( REGARDLESS OF THE FACT THAT THERE IS A BETTER CHOICE ) . <p> The school I go to and work at , UC Davis , recently made the switch to statying Mozilla as the officially supported @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the thousands of people that still use it , but the thousands of incoming freshmen are all told to download mozilla for the best experience with all of the web utilities that we have here , and we distribute it on a CD of software that we sell . <p> On a side note : the second I showed my dad that mozilla blocks popups , he switched . <p> Actually , from the start , I really liked the Luxury Web idea . I think that its very appealing to a wide range of people , because who does n't  want the best of the best , especially when its free ? <p> As far as I know , WaSPs is the only campaign , of that sort , that is well-known . If I want to direct users to a site about upgrading their browsers , I can send them to the previously mentioned WaSP campaign , or to one of the browser ( Mozilla , Opera , etc. ) homepages . <p> None of these will appeal to the average web user . The WaSP site @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ layout is nice and simple , it is far from " luxurious . " Mozillas new design is nice and inviting , but I still feel that the content can be too technical and overwhelming for the average web user . It is difficult for us to see this because we are web designers and developers that are on the net daily and know its ins-and-outs . I would bet that if you told a friend of yours , that 's an average user , to check out one of those websites that are supposed to influence you to switch browsers , they would feel confused , overwhelmed , and , in the end , like they do not care about switching to one of these " confusing " web browsers . To be honest , I imagine that a lot of people would n't even know exactly what a web browser is . <p> This brings me back to your " luxury " idea . I think that a small site , maybe only 3 - 5 pages , with a classy ( luxurious ) design and dumbed-down content , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All content should also be as concise and to-the-point as possible . Why people should switch should be explained and also PROVED . Images of websites in IE6 and then in Mozilla and Opera would be great , especially if the websites are well-known and ones that people have likely been to before . <p> Then it should say somewhere , " Switching is only a download away ! " A lot of people probably feel that , " oh boy , switching web browsers is probably a complicated process . " But its not , and we need to tell them that , using cool , in-your-face images . Below this header will be a very cleanly laid-out list of the alternate , standards compliant web browsers . But we wo n't actually say that they " comply with standards , and therefore webpages look like they 're supposed to . " That is far from convincing for the average user . Instead , we will tell them " this browser is so great that xx% of webpages will look even better when you use it ! " ( or something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the browser logo ( people love images ) , the name of the browser , a BRIEF description of why they would want to choose that particular one , a screenshot of a page in the browser ( so they can see the interface ) , and a link that goes DIRECTLY to the download . <p> Oh yeaI also liked Tim Brays idea of mentioning big-name companies that have made the browser switch . I imagine that it would do a great job of convincing average users . <p> I feel that a " luxurious " site , if designed correctly , could make quite an impact and become very well-known . Heck , even CNN.com might do a write-up on it ; they did n't  hesitate having an article on the " weapons of mass destruction error page " that made its rounds on the net . We need to take this site and turn it into a commercial advertisement that appeals to the masses . <p> This is just me thinking out loud . To conclude , I 'll leave you with what I feel will be the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stay away from everything " tech , " including design and content terminology - cool , hip , classy design - dumbed-down content that almost everyone will understand - we need to be advertisers and make browser-switching seem like the hot-new thing , using in-your-face graphics and blurbs that tell how other big-companies are switching <p> I was really inspired by Tims post and put on my badge as soon as I could . Since Microsoft killed stand-alone IE I have been hoping that innovation by the other browser makers would become so attractive as to make IE " that quaint little browser that comes with the OS . " Kinda like Simpletext on the Mac . Sure , you *could* browse with it , but why would you want to ? <p> Telling them that their browser is no good , will be counterintuitive . Of course their browser works , because they can view any website they want . <p> I think passing judgement on the viewers choice of browser is not really effective . The trick lies in politely pushing them towards a resource that gives them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simple , yet effective site preaching the benefits of mozilla comes in . This will allow the reader to weigh his options and ultimately make a decision . Of course they may finally decide not to switch . But we should make our argument strong enough for people to atleast try . Most likely , if they do try an alternative browser , they will switch . <p> The point is that , we can not force people to switch a browser . We should n't make that decision ( or else what 's the difference between us and Microsoft ? ) . Show them the possibilities in a clear , human understandable terms and then we have something . Like I said eralier , make the package so enticing that it will be hard to resist . <p> Oh but that takes all the fun out of tying up our users and shoving them into small rooms blindfolded and forcing them to listen to " Mozilla is better , I go on first and tab the browsing Opera is better , I leave the user silky and smooth .. Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , IE ! " chanted over and over with calipso music with inscense and candles <p> And then hypnotizing them so they subconciously learn to compile binaries and trinaries and the like <p> Everyone seems so focused on a pro-Mozilla campaign . Like masad points out , what if IE7 is that good ? Then everyone gets locked into Microsofts plans , and on goes the monopoly . <p> There are two issues here , and let 's be clear to differentiate : standards support and general browser technology , but also browser choice and a continued free market . Not for a second am I interested in promoting the former . If the latter is true , then the former takes care of itself . <p> What my post seeks to address is that browsers are dying , if not dead , and Microsoft is leading this technology drain . IE has been stagnant forever , but somehow theyve still managed to fend off all competitors and tenaciously hold their market share . <p> Either we educate the consumer that they have a choice , that Microsoft is n't the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand into coding for one OS , one browser , and Microsoft dictates the standards . <p> Web standards as we know them can only survive in a competitive market with more than one product . Supporting anything other than Internet Explorer helps keep that market open . <p> In private e-mails around the time I was shaping the Luxury Web concept , I began referring to it as a Browser Choice Campaign . This is where the gold is , folks , in keeping the choice alive . <p> " We need to take this site and turn it into a commercial advertisement that appeals to the masses . " <p> This is soooo right . What if:IE7 is the most standards compliant super-fast browser ever made . It supports all CSS , PNGs , and stuff we have n't even thought of yet ( MS is that scary ) Longhorn is bundled with all new pcs ( nothing new ) <p> No one is going to switch ? Anyone who buys a new PC will have LH . I switched to XP and love it , sorry to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say that for me XP is lightyears ahead old winops . <p> I said it before on this site in a comment - now is the time - we have until 2005 before MS takes away the opportunity for us ( meaning anyone not involved with MS ) to get the word out - otherwise Opera and Mozilla and Safari etc will remain what they are today . <p> In a sense , if IE7 is what I described above then hooray - but nuts to MS for doing it this way . Let 's get people using alternative browsers . <p> I think what is missing , in the end , is a really strong marketing team/marketing scheme/marketing budget . All of which Microsoft has . We wonder why Homeland Security paid MS for their services when there are more secure and better OSes like Linux or Unix as alternatives . Its because , frankly , Homeland Security does n't  know better and the Unix or Linux people did n't  stick their nose into their business soon enough to provide competition . Homeland Security simply did n't  know there were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the browser wars consumers right now are unaware there are choices to be made . Like Dave said , the best course if finding out a way to educate consumers so the Power of Choice remains at hand . <p> I 'm not sure how it will all be done , but the Mozilla Foundation and others , I think , need to start getting aggressive . Whether that means partnering up with Google or something else remains to be seen . But its best to start now before its too late . <p> I definitely agree that a campaign should show consumers that they have a choice of many browsers , and not just give them a link to Mozilla and say " download this ! " A small webpage/website that gives brief and understandable summaries of all of the browsers out there might be a good starting point . As I said in a comment above , the site needs to be stylish , clean , commercial , intriguing , influential , and much more . <p> I 've already started a design for a site like this , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Browser Campaign . " I 'm not sure if I have the time or overall knowledge to write the content for the site . Either way , I 'm hoping to get it done . <p> I 'm wondering what would be so bad if IE7 ( or Longhorn or whatever its caled ) did comply with all standards . Is it because MS would make it proprietary , and not open source ? Heck , if the most popular browser complied with all the standards , then I think we as designers would be happy about it . <p> Now if they just make sure to incorporate tabbed browsing , I 'm thinking IE7 may turn the heads of the die hard Mozilla/Opera fans . And why not ? <p> We could place pop-ups on our websites that tell them to get Mozilla , Opera , or Safari because they have pop-up blocking . ; - ) <p> I know its meant to be a joke , but what a great way to alienate any potential upgraders ! <p> I think a large percentage of web users will always experience the Internet through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a true challenge . Perhaps a bigger challenge is showing them how to use a browser other than then the one built-in with their ISP software . <p> To reach that crowd effectively , youd almost need an ISP to use Mozilla instead of IE in their Internet application . I guess its semi-safe to say that AOL is n't going to do this ; well just have to wait and see . Count out MSN. ; - ) <p> But what about Earthlink ? Or smaller regional ISPs ? ( I only speak of the US , surely there are large competitors of AOL and MSN internationally who could be persuaded ) . <p> I think that a small , accessible , and user friendly website singing the virtues of Mozilla is a good idea but I still doubt its effectiveness . You have to understand that more the majority of users IE 6.0 is more than adequate . Frankly , except the lack of PNG support ( which is pretty obscure beyond the designer circleI mean even Adobe Photoshop does n't  support it adequately ) , there is nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Built in pop-up blocking was n't available but is now with the Google Toolbar . The only major advancement in Gecko based browsers is that of Tabbed Browsing , a virtue that should be stressed more often it is . Frankly , nobody cares that Mozilla is open source . Nobody will switch because of that . People will switch if you show them that tabbed browsing is more effective and productive than what they have in IE. <p> Secondly , no amount of user friendly information , will supplant the lack of a mozilla installer . Yes , there is no installer . An installer is something the average user understands . It is a minor thing but for the average user it provides an ease of mind . <p> The problem with mozilla is not the product itself ( which is awesome beyond measure ) but the package . The package is nowhere perfect . There is too much information in way too many mozilla devoted sites . To succeed , we have to sell a coherent , complete and specific signal that cuts through all the noise . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think the trick is for we web designers and web developers to include a little addition on our sights that provide immediate feedback to J. Random WebSurfer that their web browser is sub-standard . Hide a link to a " why you should upgrade page " using a simple CSS2 selector to set display : none . The browsers that have implemented this feature will dutifully hide that link . The ones that havent will display the link . <p> I 've included an example of what I have in mind on my site , and I 've posted some details about it here : <p> YESS ! ! That is the key . I have this ides - Imagine in Canada , an article in Technology , or better , the lifestyle section of the Globe and Mail - pushing how a better browser makes for a better experience . I think it would work . <p> Eric , if I can quote Dave on this one : " its about browser choice and a continued free market . " <p> " A small webpage/website that gives brief and understandable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good starting point . " <p> This idea is a necessary crack filler , but what we need here is something bigger , something to point the masses to that page . I live in Spain , where the Internet is still awakening to its full potential - ie there are plenty of young people here who do n't  even know how to turn on a computer . <p> These people do n't  surf the internet that broadly at all - and for them , like a lot of people in NA , IE does the job . Why are they going to change ? Were talking about getting a big ball rolling here . <p> Now look for a second at Wasp - it is becoming a success - i.e. they made a ball and started it rolling , but its got a long way to go still - just have a surf away from Mezzoblue , Stopdesign , and Zeldman for a sec and you will see all of the non-standards stuff out there . With this next step were talking about starting a second much bigger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be strategic here . Hit hard where the trends are set - N.A:Newspapers , not ads , but articles .

All this hoohah about Google lately - how about a focus on web-standards and alternative browsers in the WSJ ? <p> I may be dreaming here but the internet has changed since Wasp happened . Some of the principles are the same , but its mainstream in N.A. now . Hit mainstream - not niche ( i.e. weblogs ) - media . Get N.A. on board and the rest of us may follow . <p> Now I realize that people are scared of MSFTs power , but getting people away from IE6 will be tough because there is no compelling reason to the viewer . When upgrading from NS4 people could see an immediate performance improvement , and often a visual improvement . Right now Mozilla offers only a better way to write pages . CSS selectors are nice , but do n't  do anything that ca n't be replicated in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if its that important to you , you can already do it in IE ( in an IE specific way ) . Pages wo n't look better , they wont be faster , and they wo n't have additional functionality . I 've seen a few sites that say " You are running IE6 , you should upgrade to . " This tells me the person is a silly idealist , and my respect for them deteriorates . <p> I still want to lock people up with the Calipso music ; but I digress . Take a look at Cafeshops and imagine shirts , hats , stickers , mugs , geez they even have undergarments with the " wasp " logo or the " Get a better browser " logo or something along those lines . Alot of crazy stuff starts out like a fad and becomes iconic- maybe the " Better browser " thing could be like that .

I was n't , until recently . <p> During the first day of the recent FITC conference , Karsten Januszewski ( a Microsoft tech evangelist ) gave a talk on the forthcoming Avalon . The relevance to the audience was that advanced media and UI features made possible by Avalon will eventually require creators , many of whom Microsoft hoped to reach here . Developers , developers , developers <p> My familiarity with the technology up to that point was limited ; I had basically thought of it as Quartz ( OS Xs advanced screen rendering system ) for Windows . I 'm still not convinced the technology itself is much more than that , actually . Avalon composites many different types of media text , images , video , and vector shapes . I 'm somewhat unclear how detailed the native 3D rendering support is . There was a demo of multiple video sources being mapped to rotating spheres , so there 's at least a few basic shapes and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ special guests pulled on stage a software company that created a 3D -&gt; Flash convertor , which it had adapted for Avalon . Given Flashs lack of native 3D object support , hence the need for this tool , Im left wondering what that means for Avalons 3D support . <h> Quartz vs . Avalon <p> Without getting too carried away with the specifics though , what seems to be the main difference between Quartz and Avalon is the openness and flexibility . Avalon goes hand-in-hand with XAML , Microsofts upcoming eXtensible Application Markup Language , which is XML in name if not in spirit . The upshot of which is that controlling the display is as simple as editing a human-readable text file . ( Although the Microsoft rep was quick to point out that by no means will this be the only way to do it as current and upcoming design tools adapt to generate XAML automatically . ) <p> That everything in Avalon runs on text files is actually pretty slick . I 'll give Microsoft substantial credit for that , its going to ensure a lot of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an open format to some degree . But there are two things that detract from what otherwise might have been full points . <h> The Code <p> The code itself looks like ( well-formed ) tag soup from 1997 . Whereas the web has seen a shift from presentational markup ( in the form of tables , embedded attributes like bgcolor , and the dreaded font tag ) to structural markup with a separated presentation layer ( CSS ) , XAML is purely a presentational language . I could n't see evidence of attention toward semantics , and all the presentational attributes are embedded right in the markup . Januszewski referenced a CSS-like syntax , but there 's nothing CSS-like about it . Its ugly presentational HTML all over again . A sample snippet : <p> It appears to me this is single-purpose code , rather than the layered approached of HTML/CSS/DOM . Can it degrade ? How much thinking has Microsoft done about accessibility ? What will this code do on a PocketPC or PalmOS cell phone ? <p> Maybe this code makes sense from a desktop computer application development context @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ context . The separation of structure and presentation is now a no-brainer , so Im left wondering why it has been completely ignored here . Its like the past few years of undoing the markup sins of the late 90s havent happened . Or , they have n't happened at Microsoft . ( Other divisions MSN seem to get it , to be fair . ) <h> XAML on the Web <p> Which brings us to the second problem XAML on the web . Yes , XAML is designed to run inside a browser . It appears a special XAML plug-in or player or something equivalent is necessary , as it was demonstrated running inside of a stock version of IE6 under Windows XP . But Microsoft loves the browser according to Januszewski , and wants it to be painless to select a link on a web page and open a XAML app as a result . Longhorn will presumably feature tight integration of the two . <p> The past couple of years of IE security problems have raised a lot of awareness about browser lock-in , and the problems that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cause . Like ActiveX , in-browser XAML/Avalon appears to be a method of continuing that trend . Something tells me we wont be seeing an Avalon player for Linux any time soon . <p> I 'd be a whole lot more comfortable with XAML if it were strictly meant as a Windows OS rendering language . Proprietary markup on a proprietary platform is nothing to get worked up over . But the obvious web cross-over leads me to hope were not going to see a whole new generation of browser/OS-specific web apps . I wonder if Microsoft might be hoping for something different . <p> If anyone who understands XAML better than I would like to come in and tell me how backwards I have it , I 'd love to hear from you , comments are open . I 'd rather my first look is all wrong and my worries unfounded ( even though I 'd like to think I understood the presentation properly ) . 30451 @qwx890451 <p> You are reading " Avalon/XAML First Look " , an entry made on 14 April , 2005 , filed under " Technology " . 
@@99593469 @3793469/ <p> A new solution just popped up that enables clearing of floats without the markup hacks of old . Great ! Except there 's a caveat : scrollbars . <p> First reported on this SitePoint blog entry , later followed up with a description and some test cases by Anne van Kesteren , a new method of clearing floats involves using overflow : auto ; to expand the parent and contain all children , thus forcing it to contain even floated elements within . <p> While overflow : auto is working for us in this case when it comes to vertical overflow , unfortunately it also applies to horizontal overflow as well . Therefore , all child elements must be smaller than or equal to the width of the parent , otherwise ugliness occurs . <p> We have two pargraphs side by side , contained within a parent div . We want the border of the div to surround both paragraphs ; because they 're floated , though , the border of the parent does n't  surround either and bunches up at the top as a solid grey bar . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expand and include the children ; traditionally , you could have applied a float : left ; to the parent and found some way to work around the resulting float . Or now with the new method , you do n't  have to worry about any re-positioning of the parent after all , because the overflow property does n't  affect it the way a float would : <p> ( Note that due to positioning in these examples , the floated parent layout issues are n't  apparent ; it would take extra complexity to demonstrate that , but if you 're at all familiar with floats it should n't be too much of a stretch to see how the floated parent would be problematic . ) <p> What happens , though , if the child element is simply too large for the parent ? This may be triggered in environments where dynamic content might see the addition of an image with particularly large dimensions , or by something silly like the italicized text problem in Win/IE . <p> Ah . And so we reach the crux of the matter . Neither solution is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overflow . Each handles it in a different way . The overflow method does n't  require extra positioning aerobics to adapt to the position of a floated parent , but its method of handling overflow may be more problematic than the float method . <p> Its always great to have another tool in the arsenal , but remember that the Achilles heel of this one is the horizontal scrollbars you may experience in your layout . <p> Yeah , I just started using overflow:auto , and I 've found it to be kinda hit-and-miss . For example , I was just working with a simple header , left-nav , content layout , where the nav was floated left and the content had a left margin to cover it . In that case , adding overflow:auto caused Firefox to calculate the margin starting from the right side of the nav instead of the right side of the page all of a sudden , but IE still calculated it from the right . Beyond that , it did n't  actually expand the container to fit the content in IE. So I suspect this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I just started using overflow:auto , and I 've found it to be kinda hit-and-miss .

Beyond that , it did n't  actually expand the container to fit the content in IE. So I suspect this is useful only in certain circumstances . <p> The examples are nice and dandy , but what 's wrong with the " 21st century Method " as described on Position Is Everything ? LONG ... <p> I thought floats were solved ! Because well , they work in a number of instances very well ( and cross browser , Woo Hoo ! ) , but when they dontuse Absolute &amp; Relative positioning ! There 's nothing dirty about itwhen you know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ semantic than adding an extra div , as using a class to add a presentational value ( that the block should clear both ) is pretty much what CSS is meant to do , so I cant really see what part of it is semantically incorrect . <p> And if you have to clear a lot of things a simple : . wrapperOfCleared div:after blah should suffice . <p> Personally , I like to use the common clearing of floats instead of the " overflow " method . With the first method , I can set a specified width and wrap words to new lines to stretch vertically . When the font is resized , usually words are n't  too long to break out of the width . If your designs are most efficient , that is elastic , then you wont have this problem at all ( provided you use the clearing method , instead of the overflow method ) . <p> When I first played around a bit with this method , I found that overflow:hidden was better . Most of the time the widest element is an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than scrollbars at narrow window widths . <p> From what I read in the comments on my site 1 , this method is n't very robust <p> I have yet to see anyone post any real-world test cases ( nor have I done them myself ; - ) , but I suppose if we are really careful this could be used . That , however , could lead to using multiple methods to solve this , which seems a little house-of-cardsish , no ? <p> Now in this case i think it would be grossly inefficient to add &lt;div class= " clear " &gt; &lt;/div&gt; or &lt;br class= " clear " /&gt; for every field . <p> Similarily , if you had a list that you wanted to style as two columns , it would make sense . <p> But for large scale layout , use the clear tags . It seems a little more robust and reliable to me . If some content renders a little wonky on some browsers , it less detrimental than if the overall layout is not stable between browsers . <p> I use overflow:hidden on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ below the div . <p> It works well , but since I use a liquid design , it could technically clip the image if the window got too small . Fortunately , the image is thin , so I think its a reasonable edge case . And the scrollbars would be really annoying . <p> problem im having is placing 2 floated elements within a containing div ( for example ) n the floated elements and content look fine , but the containing div seems to snap up behind them to the depth of 1 linespacing , i have to then add another tag within the containing div after the floats that clear:both anyone know a work around email me ? <p> Its another helpful tool , I 've used to to solve an issue where a floated image was poking out of the bottom of a container .

@@99593473 @3793473/ <p> This seems to have caught on as a standard method , and while it looks nice , its horrendously unusable for larger style sheets . A couple of columns of text on each line fill up only the first portion of the editor and leave the rest of the window empty . Scrolling to find any given element takes far too long , and wastes too much time . There 's a better way to use that space . <p> I 've started using a more compact format recently that works wonders . Depending on the size of your site , almost your full CSS definition fits on one screen , and a quick glance is all it takes to find the element you 're looking for . The above example would look like so : <p> p text-align : left ; font : 12px/16px verdana , sans-serif ; etc . <p> Not much different on the first glance , but compare these two files verbose and compact and you 'll see how the space savings start to add up with larger CSS definitions . <p> A bit onerous at first glance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through seven screens to find the element you need to edit . It even saves a trivial few dozen bytes of line breaks and spaces , if you 're into that kinda thing . <p> Just a recommendation to make your life easier . You 're welcome . 30454 @qwx890454 <p> the verbose format tends to be a stronger selling point for ppl who write their own code because javascript has a similar format . as well , unless the CSS is viewed by an application that colour-codes everything , you 're left with one big line of code that wo n't necessarily be easily understood 2-3 months down the line . ( always expect the client to want the coders to make changes ) <p> the verbose format along with smart comments and an organized method of writing the CSS tags will leave you in a position where you wont need to worry about coming back and scrolling thru the CSS file . <p> let 's just face it , we can write an entire html page on one single line , but we do n't  do it because we 've found methods to give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good file-naming convention , folder tree , and even CSS tags . <p> I like the verbose method for the reason of scanning . I can spin my mousewheel and scan down line by line really easily . However , if there 's more than one thing on a line , I actually have to read the line , long CSS files or not . Its a little like reading SQL queries , which I tend to do a lot of . While I could easily write it on one line , I 'd much rather elongate my page and split it out one item per line . When rapidly scanning pages later on , its much faster to find what I 'm looking for . Finally , I also ( and this may be a bad thing in and of itself ) tend to split my CSS files up . I have tag definition file , wherein I put default styles for existing tags . I then have ( if neccessary - sometimes this is merged in with the tag def file ) a typography file , wherein styles affecting copy &amp; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , wherein I define , well , layout-related styles . <p> Addressing scanning : notice in the compact mode how easy it is to scan for #buttons , for example . Then scan for #linkorama in the verbose . This is the way I work - I care far more about quick access to the individual elements than I do about the attributes to each . I have no problems scanning a line for the padding , for example . <p> If its a personal preference issue , therell be no consensus here . Either you like it or you do n't  . I find it far more usable to do something about the ridiculous amounts of white space in the right of the window when I 'm editing . You may be perfectly happy not to . <p> I definitely see the benefits in using the compact format for larger CSS files . When I 'm developing a site , however , I find the verbose format much easier to manage . Quicker to triple-click to select an entire line containing a single rule and copy or move to the beginning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where the highlighting needs to start/end , then again precisely click where you want it to go . Also the verbose format helps me quickly compare rules for two selectors , for troubleshooting and coding efficiency . After the CSSs developed , though , I see the benefits of converting it to compact for quicker overall scanning later on . Both modes work for me at different points in the development cycle . <p> George - true enough . Haze pointed out to me recently that padding : 0px 0px 0px 0px ; does bad things on Mac IE. But shorthand and the compact mode are two separate ideas . <p> Alannie - I think you 've hit on it . Its easier for me to work with the verbose mode during development ; all the white space is a luxury and I do n't  mind scrolling as much since each element is fresh in my mind . But maintaining it afterwards is a huge pain , which is where I find the compact mode shines . <p> If you 've ever had to redesign from an existing CSS file I mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few elements around you 'll probably be with me on this . <p> I have tried both methods discussed here . I usa the verbose style in Bradsofts Top Style Pro . The Selectors window allows me to jump to whichever selector I need to work on . However , on a large project , I prefer to break up the styles into a number of sheets labelled according to their function ( eg Page , Divs , Links , Text &amp; Images ) . <p> I can not stress enough the importance of commenting the code , particularly if certain broweser workarounds are employed or a certain approach is used where another would have been just as good . A commented note will save hours of head scratching later . Good practices in programming should apply here to design do n't  leave the comments to the end , do them as you go and they will actually mean something , and they might actually help you later ! <p> Congratulations on the CSS Zen Garden by the way , I found the link from Eric Meyers site and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use a version of the compact method but waste horizontal space .

And many of these coders look at the designers failure to duplicate their success as laziness or worse , without realizing that a designers skill set simply does not extend to the world of fixing code output . <p> This divide is illustrated nicely in Mike Davidsons article which I linked yesterday . Mike is looking for reasons not to validate because he deals with these types of systems , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have the resources for . The fun begins when Steve Champeon pokes his head in ( comment 15 ) and attacks Mikes arguments on firm logical grounds . But Steve throws in a telltale sign that he has unrealistic expectations of Mike , by referencing " the slacker ethic " and stopping just this side of calling Mike lazy . <p> There are two truths here . One , people of all different backgrounds and talent levels are creating content for the web . Two , there 's still a remarkable assumption that one who does a certain job for the web does all jobs for the web , which even comes from colleagues who should know better . That the assumption exists is true ; the assumption itself is suspect . Everyone who survived the past 5 years of economic downturn did so by diversifying , but specialties still exist simply due to the massive variety of possible skills that no human could master in one lifetime . I do n't  expect a coder to know the first thing about monitor colour profiles or typography ; its great if they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a coder should not assume a designer knows how to deal with data , or fix validation errors using code . <p> Okay , whew , were through the build up . That wasnt even the part I wanted to write . This is : <p> Can we all just shut up and start listening to each other please ? <p> Designers : the coders are trying to tell you that there are ways to encode those ampersands and validate things like comments , do it with minimal time investment , and make it happen automatically . <p> Coders : the designers are trying to tell you they do n't  have the skills to implement these methods and they need guidance here . <p> During the raging debate on this site last week , two contenders Jacques Distler and D. Keith Robinson both contributed their share of the blows , but after the dust settled they ended up working together to solve Keiths problems . A coder willing to share his or her experience is worth 20 coders who will point out a problem without suggesting a fix . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problem under the rug and justify it with spurious logic is golden . <p> What we need is to start working together like this on a larger scale . Youve gone to lengths to programmatically fix improperly nested tags ? Great , write it up . You have a killer PHP function for parsing out raw ampersands that can be copied and pasted into a site-wide header ? Perfect , share it . You can make a bad tool better ? Do it ! We do n't  have to keep re-inventing the wheel for every new site , we can build common code bases that make validation painless and share them . <p> A knowledge base of tricks and tips for dealing with bad HTML would go a long way if its easily understandable by the non-technical , or even better , copy and pastable . Arguing is a good way to waste time , but if you really want to change the way someone works , show someone how it can be done . Do n't  leave it up to them . <p> Now this is more like it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Let me know , I 'll start building a list :

His full-time role is senior web designer/developer with Nationwide Building Society , a UK-based financial services organisation which , despite the protests below , does n't  do a bad job of making its web pages accessible and standards-compliant . <h> Designing for the Future , and the Training Gap <p> How do you encourage unenthusiastic developers/mark-up authors to adopt forward-thinking web development methods ? <p> How do you engage people who consider their work on the web as just that : only work , something that pays the bills but does n't  exactly leave them beside themselves with excitement ? <p> I am but one individual in a team of many ( in my place of full-time employment ) and I am from a strange breed - I have a passion for the web ! What happens when you are part of a team that is not as uniformly enthusiastic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many IT managers and standards advocates working in the corporate sector . Though were doing good things in adopting accessibility practices and optimising our code , its still very difficult to get a site to conform to all the major standards in the real world . Why is this the case ? <h> Learn from Textbook Cases <p> Andy Kings book Speed Up Your Site includes numerous tricks and tips for committed web developers . Jeffrey Zeldmans Designing With Web Standards is a tome of practical , well-thought-out techniques . Both not only explain how to improve the way we develop sites for maximum efficiency and future-proofing , but they also clearly detail why the problems exist in the first place . <p> These are just two books among many that have made me think and re-think about how I build personal sites and company projects . I devour the content of these books and regurgitate it - metaphorically speaking - wherever I can . Sometimes these tips and tricks find their way on to the corporate work , but invariably they 're resigned only to my personal work . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! As unappealing as that is , that 's where I pick up most snippets of information ( they say that the seat of learning is Oxford but I beg to differ - its the downstairs loo ) . Because I have a passion for what I do , I 've made it my business ( no pun intended ) to learn how to construct table-free page layouts , make pages accessible for keyboard-only users , provide different views of a page through alternative style sheets , and more . I do n't  have to . But I want to make things work better , faster and cleverer . But were not all like this . Most people would rather read a newspaper on the toilet . Or maybe nothing at all . But that 's quite enough of our potty habits for now . Shall we move along ? <p> This is because its far easier for an individual to introduce a novel or clever way of doing things - there are no committee decisions ( and therefore no split decisions or arguments ) . As well , no matter how progressive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe Nationwide qualifies here ) , there will always be an issue with introducing new methods . Let 's just overlook the fact that many of the methods that I 've alluded to are actually a number of years old ( CSS2 , hello ? ) - its all about perception . If other people , and by that I mean corporates , are not doing it , then it must be new , right ? <p> Look at just a handful of the things happening on these forward-thinking personal web sites : <p> Totally CSS-based page layouts <p> Gone are the tables that were never intended for layout purposes ( tables are for data , folks - layout grids are an abuse of the mark-up , an abuse that we 've come to live with and accept a bit like an irritable auntie with an equally irritable terrier that visits every weekend ) . Now we can view such sites on a PC , a handheld device , using a screen reader and more , and we get the added bonus of quicker-loading pages . <p> More usable forms <p> The &lt;label&gt; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ browsers , and in the right hands they can make a form far more usable and accessible . And they 're definitely semantically sound . <p> Data tables that work <p> Using elements like &lt;caption&gt; , &lt;thead&gt; , &lt;tbody&gt; and &lt;tfoot&gt; , and attributes such as summary , scope , ids and headers , data tables become meaningful to blind users accessing the content with a screen reader ( rather than a jumbled mush of words and numbers ) . <h> Training is the Weakness <p> Let 's assume , for example , that browser support is not the issue , that you 've taken a stance and agreed to support browsers that support web standards ( while not completely turning your back on the older browsers ) . Let 's assume you 've already said that your company is going to focus on getting things right for IE5+ , Netscape 6+ ( or Mozilla/Gecko derivatives ) and Safari . Now inadequate browser support is no longer an issue . You should be able to do things right , right ? The browsers you 've settled on are up to the job so what 's stopping your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> You may have a few individuals in a department that have a passion for doing things according to the relevant standards and as efficient as possible ; but you are equally as likely to have a whole group of people - probably a much greater percentage - who do not share that passion . They may have learned HTML five or more years ago and are still using the same methods ( tag soup ) that they always have . Every team is different , but here are some that you may identify with : <p> Fear of change - they know where they are with the old school methods <p> They believe that the new methods are more complicated <p> They do n't  understand semantic mark-up ( in fact they have never even heard the word semantic before ) <p> Their job is just a job and learning new things is either a bore or an intrusion into their personal free time ( they just do n't  get that whole toilet-seat-learning thing ) . <p> They see themselves as back-end people who would rather spend their energies optimising @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be rendered on screen , since " that 's for the UI guys to take care of " <p> But perhaps the biggest reason is : <p> No-ones told them or shown them how . <p> And if we are indeed talking about people who otherwise wont actively go out and learn for themselves , not only can you discount the likelihood that theyll take a book home , you can also rule out them picking up new techniques from reading the weblog of an influential and knowledgeable individual . Perhaps you even know people who have been working on the web in one way or another for a number of years who would respond with : " What on earth is a weblog ? " <h> When Simple Mark-up Causes Maintenance Woes <p> When I look at the mark-up on a well-conceived site , I understand the structure intuitively - " Ah , I know what that &lt;h1&gt; means Ah , so that nested &lt;ul&gt; is the sub navigation " and so on . Editing such pages is - or at least should be - much easier than hacking away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for layout . Although the page may be 50% smaller than its old-school counterpart , and it may be simpler to edit , what happens when someone else wants to maintain the page that has been so carefully crafted ? <p> here 's where I begin to fly in the face of common consensus - it being that if you code to web standards , it makes for easier maintenance of your site to those joining a project later . My experience has , thus far , shown the opposite to be true . It pains me to admit this . <p> No matter how simple the mark-up is , cleverly crafted pages can leave some people struggling . " Er , what are all these &lt;div&gt; thingies ? I do n't  get it why cant we use a table like everyone understands ? " . And just wait until they get a load of the Box Model Hack in your CSS file ( or any other CSS hack , for that matter ) ! Its not unknown for sites/web pages to go far forward in terms of standards compliance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new , simpler methods are not properly understood by those who may need to maintain these pages . <h> Change Come from Within <p> From my experience though , once people do finally get it , they wonder why they did n't  do things more simply before . There is a definite Eureka ! moment , but if the person or persons concerned do not want to learn , you may never reach it . So they have to be told , enlightened - it needs a push on your part rather than a pull on theirs . But that 's not easy either . <p> Enforced training is not always gratefully accepted though ( unless it involves a trip abroad and a nice expense tab , of course ) and often the training is hideously outdated . The techniques described in Zeldmans , Kings and other peoples books are not taught in any residential training that I have ever seen . The latter are still stuck in the old school " Let 's give em &lt;font&gt; tags and nested &lt;table&gt;s " approaches . <p> Bottom line is - there are still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of web design , and only when these people can get enthusiastic about adopting new methods will we be delivered to the promised land of perfect mark-up . <h> No Easy Solution <p> " So train them yourself ! " I hear you screaming at the page . Perhaps it should be up to individuals to lead the way after all , but this may not be possible for a number of reasons : <p> no time to train ( everyones busy ) <p> no skill in training ( it does n't  matter how knowledgeable you are if you bore everyone to death ) <p> someone more senior than you does n't  want to hear it from an underling <p> its just not a sexy and exciting topic for a lot of people ! <p> Perhaps we need to send uninitiated developers to a Designing with Web Standards boot camp ( are you listening Jeffrey ? ) and leave them in the hands of a capable trainer who can be trusted to enthuse and inspire others to greatness . Any training course today is liable to be of the " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ red text " variety - and that does n't  help anyone . <p> So what 's the solution ? Unfortunately , I do n't  come with the answer , only my very evident frustrations . <p> One comment I received prior to publication was that " it has to come from the top down " . If management says this is how it should be done , and there are financial gains for doing so ( a higher annual pay raise , for example ) then you 've got one big incentive right there . <p> The dream of writing mark-up based on standards is not a pipe dream , but it can be a nightmare getting other people to follow suit . I just hope that venting these frustrations might spark conversation among passionate people on the web about what can be done . In the meantime , if anyone can prove me wrong about the standard of training available ( particularly in the UK ) then I 'd love to hear from you ! I could fill a room with developers who are not yet up to speed on these new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the process , yeah ? 
@@99593476 @3793476/ <p> Ive been using Cuf+n off and on since writing about font embedding back in May . Its a great hack , but browser progress since that time has been making me feel that the native CSS@font-face rule is becoming increasingly viable . Or , at least enough so that it seems like its time to start dabbling . <p> Yes , I know of TypeKit . Its a great idea and there are some solid reasons to consider using it . But I 'm still interested in using the native technology from time to time , which is where we begin . <p> Ignoring the licensing issues for now , the problems are those of syntax and technology . Syntax because Internet Explorer requires you to import a different file than every other browser . Technology because , well , Internet Explorer requires you to import a different file than every other browser . <p> If you just forget about IE for a minute then @font-face is surprisingly easy to use . Getting started requires a couple of lines of CSS and the right file in the right place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ page with just a little more work than applying a custom background image . Start with the @font-face declaration itself : <p> What this is saying is : " hey browser , here 's a font family called Museo Sans . When you see reference to this font in the stylesheet please check whether the font exists on the users local computer . If it does n't  then here 's a file in OpenType format that you can use instead . " I 've specified two different faces for the local computer , both the generic family name ( Museo Sans ) and the specific weight I 'd like to use ( Museo Sans 500 ) . This may not be strictly required depending on the typeface , but cant a bad idea . <p> Once you 've defined the font-family all you have to do is reference it on elements youd like to be rendered with it : <p> h1 font-family : " Museo Sans " , Arial , sans-serif ; <p> That 's it , really . Firefox , Safari , Opera ? The latest versions of these browsers all work like a charm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything with this that you start running into problems . Luckily , Paul Irish uncovered the magic voodoo incantation that selectively serves the right file to the right browser . The syntax is only marginally more complicated : <p> Ill leave the explanation of why that particular rule order is important to Pauls article , but suffice it to say this is the syntax you should be using . ( Also related , Pauls Rich Typography presentation is worth spending some time flipping through . ) <p> So that 's the syntax part of the equation solved . But remember we also have a technological problem ; IE does n't  do anything useful with OTF or TTF files . It requires a converted , proprietary ( though proposed-to-be-open ) format called EOT . If you have a TTF or OTF file , how do you convert it to EOT ? <p> More on this in a follow-up post in the near future . Ill spoil the punchline right now : the official tool for doing so is a horrible piece of abandonware that might work if you get lucky ( I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line tools that , apparently , work for some ( not me ) . <p> However , there is a way . It ai n't  pretty . But it has the advantage of actually working . <p> I 'm looking forward to the second article . I failed miserably trying to convert OTF to EOT . I was trying convert OTF to TTF first , but then the result wasnt read by this terrible MS tool you mentioned . <p> I was lately playing with @font-face and had problems with converting otf to eot too . Converting ttf to eot is quite easy ( http : **29;657;TOOLONG ) . So I did something like this : took otf and converted it to ttf ( http : **26;688;TOOLONG ) . And then there was no problem with ttf2eot . And it worked in IE without any problems . <p> @Mitch - yep , that 's the only thing that worked for me . Couldnt beat Jonathan to the punch and write up his method before he did , but up until he showed me how he does it yesterday , I was set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The one problem Ive encountered in implementing @font-face is with using italics . If I include , say , Linux Libertine O via @font-face , and specify it as my body font , even if I also include Linux Libertine O Italics in @font-face it wont be picked up as the italics version of the body font . Instead , the browser will create a fake italic ( aka oblique ) out of Linux Libertine O. <p> I 've tried getting around this by specifying Linux Libertine O Italics as the preferred font for em and i , but this has its own problems , inasmuch as you then have to set font-style:normal to prevent the browser from putting trying to " italicize " the already italic font by making it oblique . That means , then , that you have to specify all the font options for em and i using italic versions . The whole thing is very messy . <p> If anyone knows of any solutions to this problem , I 'd be very grateful to hear them . <p> @DRoss - I used that tool yesterday and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The big issue preventing me ( and most people ) from using @font-face is licensing . The font foundries are n't  going to agree to allowing their fonts to be used with @font-face until there is some sort of mechanism to protect the original font file . Unless I 'm missing something and this already exists ? <p> So for now I 'm having to use Cufon ( if the license allows ) or otherwise stick with sIFR . <p> Are any other readers getting @font-face to work on other versions of IE8 ? Like on XP or Vista ? <p> I have not yet used custom fonts not because of IE , but because of large file size . I have not experimented in years though , but I 'll try it out soon and hopefully get a reasonable size ( Web fonts are cached , right ? ) <p> As for the rule order not working , I think we are stuck serving an IE-only stylesheet . <p> I just tried this on XP in IE8 , Firefox and Safari 4 .

Presenting min-height , without the min-height . <p> If I had a penny for every time Ive run into a situation where I really needed a block of content with a specific height , but decided not to due to the issues involved well , I 'd have a few bucks anyway . <p> There 's no reliable way to place elements inside a parent and then have it expand gracefully along with the elements , if the parent has a starting height value . This is precisely the problem min-height solves , but its frustrating that its so unusable . <h> The Test Case <p> Take this demo page , for example . Placing the navigation where it is requires a header of an exact height , otherwise the proportions matching the photo and the rest of the header are completely off . <p> But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ user has a larger font size , or anything at all happens that would require the navs height to expand , it expands outside of the header and overlaps into the content area below within browsers that adhere to the spec for height property . <h> The Problem <p> min-height is the logical choice for finding a solution that would allow the header to expand gracefully as the nav does , but it is n't supported by Internet Explorer or , unfortunately , Safari . <p> I say unfortunately because there 's a fantastically easy way around the issue in IE , but not Safari height is basically treated as min-height . With a bit of filtering , its a snap to craft a solution that works between IE and Mozilla . But once you throw Safari in the mix , its not that simple . <p> Since min-height itself is unusable , there have only been a few possible ways of dealing with situations like this . Take this example page with four stacked , variable-sized divs . The content itself dictates the height of each , which may be fine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sometimes it makes more sense visually for the content to fit within a certain-sized area . <p> Let 's say the divs should be a minimum of 200px high . If we apply a height attribute directly to each , well , the results are n't  quite what wed hope scroll to the third &amp; fourth divs to see them overlapping . <p> The problem is evident in anything but IE ; the results are in fact exactly what were hoping for in IE , just not actually correct according to the spec . When were also trying to account for dynamic content ( which could be any length ) or scalable text ( which could be any size ) , its even harder to predict a boxs optimal height . Defining specific heights will lead to overlap sooner or later , and that 's no good . <h> Potential Solutions <p> We could try overflow : auto ; and force scrollbars to avoid it in all situations , but that 's a really kludgy workaround and no one likes scrollbars anyway . Its a technical fix to a technical problem that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might be able to script our way around the problem ( or use a proprietary attribute like IEs expression property ) , but for the sake of validation and not relying on an external script , what about a fix using valid CSS alone ? <p> Well , that pretty much exhausts the range of possibility . Or so I always believed . <p> I keep running into this problem in my own work , and I 'm always unsatisfied by the eventual results . Letting the content dictate minimum size messes up proportions unless everyone and their dog is using the same default font size , which they 're not , and it forces limitations on how much content you can place inside the block which , given the required flexibility of most web design tasks these days , is never a good idea . <p> I finally got fed up with this limitation and decided it was time to fix it once and for all . And by George I think that 's exactly what I 've done . <h> Solving It <p> My method of attack involved figuring out how to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see only one real way of going about it I needed to prop open the parent element with some sort of 200px high spacer that would n't affect the internal layout ( and thus allow the element to expand as the content does , but not collapse past 200px if the content is short ) . <p> So I tried a few things and spent a while thinking about it , and here 's what ended up working . Take this construct : <p> &lt;div class= " box " &gt; &lt;p&gt;Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt; <p> Applying 200px of top padding to the parent div guaranteed it would always be at least 200px high that 's half the battle right there . <p> . box padding-top : 200px ; <p> The child p element is pushed down below that initial gap , so moving it back up to the top of the parent became the new challenge . Relative positioning would work , but it would also leave a space for the element . The total height of the construct would be child height + 200px , no matter what size @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a negative top margin of 200px would effectively erase that initial lead , and allow the entire construct to size according to the child except when the child was smaller than 200px . Then the containing parents bottom edge would determine the size of the construct , which would always be 200px , which is our desired min-height effect . <p> . box padding-top : 200px ; . box p margin-top : -200px ; <p> In Safari and Firefox , we 've got it solved , but not IE. Remember that IE already does min-height though , because that 's how it treats height , so a bit of browser-specific filtering should do it : <p> The problem is now IE5/Mac it actually applies all three styles . It gets the first two right , but then it also has the same parsing bug that IE/Win does and applies the second one , which really makes a mess of things . So an extra filter for IE5/Mac is necessary : <p> Is that it ? Not quite yet , there 's also Opera . Unfortunately it does n't  want to seem to keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of an explicit height value collapses the entire parent element , padding included . We can keep it open and get our padding back by setting a min-height , though any value will do : <h> Final Notes <p> And there we have it . ( Also , a fully-commented version ) Its a bit messy , but it works in everything , and presumably it applies equally to the min-width property ( although I have n't tested that yet ) . The only caveat seems to be Opera 6 , which despite all that still collapses the parent . Oh well , Opera 6 is two years old now and Opera users ought to know better than that , so I 'm not losing sleep ; it degrades gracefully , anyway , and that 's what 's important . <p> The only real markup dependency is on a parent that contains a single child . The construct used in the example has a single p element ; adding a second one would mess things up considerably though , so in cases where more elements are needed within the parent its a better idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> And our example from above ? Piece of cake . When the navigation is longer , the content bumps down to account for the larger header . When its short , the header retains its minimum height . <p> Addendum : In theory , this should also work the same as the above method , but the syntax is a bit nicer . Ill test it more thoroughly , so for now there are no guarantees about the utility of this code . ( Thanks to Henrik Lied for pointing out ! important , which I always manage to forget about ) <p> 12/2/04 Addendum : maybe not . Faruk Ates reports the second example does n't  work in IE. However , Mitchell Stokely provides this further variation based on his Stokely hack which remains unverified and untested at the moment :

Pixels are n't  scalable within the most common browser on the market , and if you do everything you can to support relative units , you will still get people complaining that you are using text that 's too small , or too big , or too low in contrast , or too high in contrast . A designer can do his or her best to find a happy medium , but someone will always speak up : <p> Of course I know how to adjust font size in my browser quickly . Doing it all the time is annoying though . <p> My fonts are based on your default browser size . If you bump that up , they scale accordingly . So is this my problem , or , perhaps , yours ? <p> And what about thin users who think that IE is the internet ? <p> My site is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do mom &amp; pop care about CSS , after all ? <p> Perhaps your site is not for them , but , in my opinion , ALL websites should be accessible to ANYONE , ANYWHERE .

But they are able to view it all the same not only are my fonts scalable , the rest of my site complies with Section 508 and the better half of WAIs AAA . In fact , it would be single A if it werent for FIR ; other than that its kosher . Even IE can scale my fonts just fine , and it renders the site well . <p> I really have a hard time understanding what your problem is if you do n't  want to hit CTRL + + just say so , and do n't  cloak it behind misdirected accessibility concern . This is n't an accessibility problem , its a convenience problem , nest-ce pas ? <p> Okay , a rather contentious way to start off the day . But something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that text size should be left alone ; a users default font size should n't be messed with . This is an idealist view , and not at all representative of how the world works . <p> Built into that viewpoint is the nanve , or willfully ignorant assumption that all users are a ) aware of this setting , and b ) have changed it to suit their preference . Even the low percentage of the population that know they can do this generally wont ; too many existing pages rely on a 16px default font size . The majority , believe it or not , would bump their default down a size or two . 16px is too big for most people . <p> If it helps , do n't  consider this issue on a site-by-site basis , consider it on a web-as-a-whole basis .

And they assume because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the default font size . <p> Let 's ignore Internet Explorer for a second . Browsers like Firebird and Safari allow a quick adjust . If , as a user , I visit a site that uses a text size I cant read , I can hit CTRL + + a few times until its legible . Done , and my fonts are now bigger for every other site . The fact is that my browser allows me to compensate in different ways ; I can even whip up a custom user style sheet to customize each site I care to , if I wish . <p> Which places the legibility issue in a grey area somewhere between designer and user , since both can combat the problem . The designer should take precautions to ensure his or her default font size is legible to a wide percentage of the population .

@@99593479 @3793479/ <p> Before committing this past Friday evening to a flight down the west coast , I spent a bit of time preparing to try out something that I 'd been curious about for a while . Could I get through US immigration and airport security both without a paper boarding pass ? <p> Of course these days its becoming more common to check in for a flight from a browser window and print out your own boarding pass before leaving for the airport , but I 've been wondering why the printing part is necessary . I 've heard reports of varying success from others who have attempted going purely electronically , so I made sure to have a paper backup in my bag for this one . Just in case . <h> At Home <p> There 's an iPhone application called AirSharing that acts as a basic file server as well as a document viewer for a lot of common file formats , all on your phone . I managed to grab a free copy during a promo months back and though I had n't  yet put it to use , this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pass onto my phones large screen . <p> At the end of the web check-in you 're asked to print your boarding pass , which I did , but I also " printed " a second time to PDF . For those not familiar , OS X has a built-in PDF generator that acts as a virtual printer ; anything that you can print to a piece paper , you can also save to an identically-formatted PDF straight from the operating systems standard print dialogue . <p> Connecting to my phone was a simple matter of hitting a button in AirSharing to find out my phones IP address , opening it as a server from my Mac ( Cmd + K in the Finder ) , and there is no step three . Once I had my phones shared folders showing up in Finder just like any other computer on the network , I dragged my boarding pass PDF into one of them and verified it would render properly on the phones screen . The text and scanner codes were legible , if a little small , but it otherwise looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't  I just mail the PDF to myself and open it in Mail ? That question was posed in the comments , and the answer is because I just did n't  think of it , not being a regular Mail user myself . So that 's another way of having a local copy of the PDF on your iPhone . <p> Giving myself an extra hour just in case , off to the airport I went . <h> At the Airport <p> Upon reaching the web check-in counter I presented my I 'd and flashed my screen-based pass at the gate agent , asking whether this was going to work or not . She did n't  have a clue , no one had tried it before ( that she knew of ) . Since I 'd already checked in online it did n't  need to be verified at this stage , but she helpfully offered to try running the scanner over the bar code and see if it registered . It did n't  . I suspect it was n't the screen that was the problem here , it was the software . I could n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the resolution was definitely less than optimal . Possible feature request for the next version of AirSharing : a higher zoom level . <p> Anyway , one checkpoint down , a bunch to go . Most major Canadian airports Vancouver included have on-site US immigration and customs booths you 're required to clear since many flights between the two countries are treated as domestic flights on the US side . So this means more places I need to show my boarding pass . <p> Before customs a fairly redundant document parser stopped us all to check documentation , just to make sure we 've got everything we need to make it through the next few steps . I showed my phone , and hit my first speed bump . A confused stare and a moments hesitant pause , and I was asked if I had a paper pass ? This is the paper pass , I countered with . Exactly the same as what would have printed out , just on a screen . Well , he was n't at all sure about that , and as soon as I helpfully mentioned I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absolutely necessary , he decided it was , indeed , absolutely necessary . After fishing out my printed pass , I showed him paper and screen side by side to prove the point , and continued on . <p> The next step was US immigration control . I presented my passport and customs form , and was asked to produce my boarding pass . Handing over the phone , the only comment I got was " boy , I 'm getting old " as he squinted to make out the tiny font . A bit of banter about the difference between Canadian and US thanksgiving later , and I 'm on to customs , which is a freebie for the purposes of this experiment since they only needed my customs form . <p> Security was up next . The first checkpoint happens as I enter the line , where a women with a highlighter walks through the line to verify everyone standing there actually has a flight to catch . When she got to me I once again handed over the phone . A bit of a pause , an exclamation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of confusion over the next step ( " You may not want to circle this one with your marker " I jokingly cautioned ) , and she let me through . <p> As I reached the front of the security line and started the disembarking process of my personal effects for screening , the guy on the other side of the conveyor belt started asking for my boarding pass , halted , and grabbed a folded up piece of paper I had set down . That was the paper backup I had pulled out earlier , so I started to explain that I had oh forget it , I thought , this one was a miss . But then he noticed that it had n't  been circled back in line , so I pulled out my phone and continued the explanation . He seemed to get it , but thought maybe it was more common on the domestic side since he had n't  seen anyone do this on his watch . Either way , I was let through , and that got me to the gate . <p> A few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was finally time to board . I decided to be at the front of the line , in the " may need extra time boarding " group since I was worried that the too-small-to-scan barcode would end up holding up the line . Instead , as I handed over my phone to the ticketing agent , I got an amused " this is so cool ! " , a verification of my seat number , and a wave on through . <p> So I made my flight , and finished this post in a Starbucks in LA . <h> Conclusions <p> Out of the six checkpoints I encountered on my way through the airport , the only one who forced me to fish out my paper pass was a relatively inessential precursory check . And now that I have some actual experience to back me up , I expect that 's one I can talk my way through by showing a bit of confidence in my electronic pass next time . <p> Still , though I have no doubt well all regularly use electronic passes in the fairly near future @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to play my experiment as a light-hearted attempt at something new , rather than insisting this was a legitimate method . If it does n't  work , no big deal , I have paper in my bag I can also show . This attitude likely helped , and will help in the future until this is more common and those working the various checkpoints have encountered screen-based passes a few times , checked with their supervisor , and made sure they 're not doing something wrong by letting the holders through . <p> Before each checkpoint I made sure I had AirSharing loaded and the pass up on screen and shown in the right orientation ( landscape worked better than portrait since the type was larger ) . Wasting time by messing around with a screen after being asked to produce documentation feels like a great way to stack the odds against acceptance of the electronic pass , so I jumped out of line a few times to ensure it was ready to go . <p> Though I did n't  really think of it at the time , it may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on an international flight . Domestic flights have fewer checkpoints , and presumably there 's a little more leniency for new methods of I 'd and boarding . At the very least you 're only dealing with a single countrys regulations . I probably would have tried domestically a few times before attempting an international flight , were I in the habit of regularly flying within my own country . Which I 'm sadly not . <p> I also think a more capable zoom function in AirSharing ( or some other PDF viewer ) would make things a bit easier . Not being able to read what 's on screen likely does n't  help sell the electronic boarding pass . I flew Alaska , whose web-printed passes have tiny type to begin with . <p> Will I attempt it again ? Sure , but I 'll keep covering my bases for now by having a paper boarding pass on hand and only trying this in airports where I speak the predominant language . <p> I use AirSharing for my boarding pass almost exclusively on my regular flights from YYZ to LHR . I 've never had any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) but the folks at YYZ now seem to expect me to pull out my iPhone ( maybe its a familiarity thing with me rather than the technology ) when I 'm heading out to London . Of course , on the London side , I have IRIS security set up so I do n't  have to go through customs or security of any kind , so that makes it easier as well . <p> Sounds to me like you spent quite a bit of time explaining about the iPhone . I 'm sure some day electronic boarding passes will become mainstream , but having to explain things over and over makes it not worth it to me . I have enough difficulties trying to explain things to some clients ; ) <p> I tried it with westjet in Ottawa . West jet actually advertises that electronic cell versions are enough . It was n't . Security would not accept it and they forced me to go to the westjet counter to get a paper one . West jet was like " oh security always stops these . They are such a pain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Awesome experiment Dave . You make a good point about the fact that you might have been more successful had you been more confident in your electronic pass . Most of the security employees are just doing what they feel is necessary to cover their butts should anything go wrong , so if they get the impression that what you are doing is completely normal they are likely willing to agree with you . <p> Its inevitable that this is going to become quite the norm so they might as well get used to it anyway . <p> Dave , that 's great ! Though its been my experience that security folks vary greatly from one airport to another and most are rude if you do n't  fit in perfectly . Makes you wonder though , when will the airlines/airports get on with technology ? <p> Thank you for this detailed writeup ! I 'm an iPhone carrying frequent traveler . I read about this type of paperless e-ticketing ( hows that for being redundant ) a couple of weeks ago and have been curious to know how it would work if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but I do n't  think I 'm brave enough to try it on my next trip to China . : - ) <p> I 've just parsed your post , but wanted to note that you *can* scan PDFs on the iPhone screen . I have the USPS 10% off anything coupon for Best Buy saved on my phone you can use it again and again and they scan right from the phone ! <p> Im thrilled to hear that there might such a low barrier but oh how I 'd hate it if that guy circled the whatever he circles on my screen ! Reminds me of the blonde with whiteout on the monitor ! : ) <p> @Angela - I 'm not at all surprised that the iPhone screen is scannable , I 've read as much elsewhere . In this one particular instance it was n't , but like I say I think that 's the fault of the software more than the screen . And your experience confirms that . <p> I 'm not sure if this would be helpful in the barcoding stage , but could you not make the boarding pass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your pictures , that way you can zoom it in to get the barcode . Seems like a lot of steps , but that thought came to me when you had mentioned that it was hard to read for the customs officer as well as the barcode scanner at the counter . Great experiment btw ! <p> as I facetiously asked via twitter - what happens if your batteries go flat ? Right now folks like you will have a paper backup - but what happens when this becomes common place ? Do n't  get me wrong , I 'm all for it ! <p> In Australia , more than one airline is introducing this at least domestically , so I 've no doubt therell be coordination with the local equivalent of the TSA about the whole issue . <p> Leaving the US was extremely easy , with no problems when I hit the UK , LHR specifically , I got a little bit of push back , but the customs guy eventually let me through . They seemed abrasive towards my data being on the screen as opposed to on paper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on paper ) . <p> For my return flight , it was again abrasive at customs coming back from the UK and a breeze in once I got to the US . <p> I cant wait for all digital boarding passes and less resistance . Until that happens , I will be carrying print outs as back up . <p> You said that it was n't the iPhone screen that kept it from being scanned , but I would argue that it was . I recently wrote an iPhone application that allows you to type barcodes in from value cards , and in return it displays the barcode to perfect spec . I thought this was an awesome idea , but it simply does n't  scan . <p> There has been a recent move in barcode scanners toward laser scanners that absorb reflected light , as opposed to absorbed light . From what I have read the glass on the screen does not allow the light to be reflected properly so you can not scan off of screens like an iPhone . This was a huge disappointment to me , especially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are what are used at self checkout counters . <p> Also , Angela says that it can be scanned . Most likely the scanner used in this case was a CCD scanner or a scanner that uses an actual camera . It comes down to what the people at the airport use to scan . <p> I really do n't  get what the fuzz is about with security . It ought to be enough to produce a number ( even a handwritten one on paper , PDA , phone , whatever ) . I take it they check the number against their database along with your Passport/ID . That combination should get you through ( or not ) . <p> Relying on anything other that some kind of I 'd ( like your name , flight number , etc ) is asking for getting scammed <p> @John Allsopp - Out of all of these , batteries were the least of my worries . I made sure to fully charge ahead of time . If at some point in the future this becomes commonplace enough that I forget to charge them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the checkin counter and asking them to issue me a paper boarding pass . <p> @Sam McDonald - thanks for the insight . The barcode in this case is a 2 dimensional scan code rather than a traditional lined barcode , so I 'd assume its a different scanner . Whether its one capable of picking up the iPhone or not , I do n't  know , but I did observe a woman this summer at the Newark airport attempt to use her Treos screen in the same way , and watched as security successfully scanned it . Its also worth noting that no one actually ended up scanning mine on my way through YVR after the initial test scan . <p> @Jilles - do n't  travel much , do you ? Airport security is rarely about the best way to do things these days . The Atlantic article that Anthony linked immediately preceding your comment is a great example . <p> I wonder what happens in the AirShare viewer if you print the page at 200% ( I 'll have to test this ) or if you screen grabbed just the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scanners to recognise it . <p> Last time I flew Air Canada the web checkin offered to send some SMS messages to my phone with URLs in them to barcodes , which were supposed to be scannable at the airport . However , my phone turned out to be too low-tech to view the URL . <p> Yeah , as mentioned above , Qantas , their low-cost subsidiary Jet Star and Virgin Blue in Australia are trialling something similar to this for domestic flights . They send the barcode as an image attachment to an MMS ( sorry iPhone ! ) , and you need to present that at the boarding gate . This is in addition to a paper pass at the moment . <p> Its stories like these that make you realise were slowly on the way to the future : ) <p> I had taken a domestic Air Canada flight that offered the web check-in . I had the boarding pass on my phone and it felt strange to present it instead of a paper pass at each stage . But I had no problems getting through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little more difficult . <p> Wow , interesting : ) I 'm flying from the Netherlands to Thailands in a month , I 'm definitely going to try this . Unfortunately I do n't  have an iPhone but a Sony Ericsson w960i , but the screen is large enough and I 'm able to view PDFs with it , so it might just work . I 'm afraid Thailand will be a lot harder than the Netherlands though . <p> I actually do . My statement is about how it ought to be , not how it is . I have similar gripes with other businesses ( who does n't  ? ) . For example , stopping a health insurance can be done by phone in the Netherlands , and the only thing they do to for verification is asking for the ( super secret ) date of birth Arrg . <p> " @Jilles - do n't travel much , do you ?

I 'm all about the old-skool paper boarding passes now <p> It is frustrating enough to have to take your jacket off , get your laptop out of your bag and take your belt off . Having to deal with unlocking your iPhone is n't worth the hassle . <p> The final straw was when I took a Westjet flight a couple of weeks ago . Showed the electronic pass to the agent at the gate . As I was fumbling with my bag and phone I managed to move the pass into a random folder ( no undo ! ) . The FA did n't  let me on the plane even though I knew my seat number and I had to go to the back of the line and get a paper pass . <p> 1 .

This problem is also an issue with paper systems ; yet , I argue a digital fake is going to be a lot easier to craft then a paper fake . <p> Digital boarding passes are a great concept . I 'm just worried about the potentials both for abuse and for malfunctions . <p> 1 ) then I guess you 'd go back to the ticket counter and get a paper one . They usually are banned , but I think they 're mostly worried about data going in and out and photos . <p> 2 ) yes . But the same is exactly true for print at home paper boarding passes as well . In fact someone recently landed themself jail time for putting a working proof of concept paper boarding pass generator on the web ( cant find it on Google at the moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or less susceptible to fraud . <p> This was a great experiment to read up on . I recently encountered some trouble myself at the airport when coming back from Las Vegas , NV about a month ago . When I tried checking in the person helping me could not find my information anywhere . At first I began to panic since I did not have anything printed out in paper as to what my flight information was . Luckily I had some smart friends who told me to look through my blackberry and find my info via email . Its not quite the same situation you were in , but it still goes to show you how much technology and PDAs are making life easier . Look forward to future trials and tribulations . <p> Sounds like its getting better . Early 2008 when Air Canada announced paperless boarding via blackberries at YVR and YYA security refused to accept ( " union wont allow training for this " was the regular excuse ) and the scanners did n't  exist at the gates for the QT code . <p> To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ check in norms and work out the technical kinks , airports and airlines are horrendously complicated systems , but hopefully they will make this leap in the next couple years .

@@99593482 @3793482/ <p> Over the past few years , I 've been invited to come speak at various events . No big surprise there , as I 've probably met a bunch of you at them . Since there 's a chance that some are publicly speaking for the first time in Austin this year , I figured I 'd share a few things Ive tried along the way . <p> These tips will probably be more relevant if you 're a nervous talker and you suspect you wo n't fill in enough time . ( If you 're a rambler , there are other people who can offer you far better advice than I. ) Its timely in a way , because I think Ive finally crossed a threshold in my own speaking . I started off early 2004 in a bit of a fluster , went into overdrive preparation mode during most of 2005 , and now in 2006 , I think I 'm easing into speaking naturally and comfortably . Finally . <p> When I first started , I was n't sure how to plan for time constraints . Speaking for an hour seemed like a long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good chance I 'd miss important points along the way and end really early . <p> So I approached my preparation as if I were writing an article , which would take approximately an hour to read out loud . I 'd hole up in a cafe and breeze through a logical progression of thoughts that ended up being 10 pages or more of printed text , and try to separate that out into smaller bite-sized points for easier scanning when presenting . Then I 'd build slides based on that . It was a lot of work . <p> Not only was I concerned about the time constraints though , I also got spooked out of allowing myself to ramble at all . I 've talked through three slides past the one that 's currently on screen , only to madly catch up later . I 've realized halfway through that I did n't  make a bunch of important points earlier to help support the current slide , so it in turn makes no sense without that context . I 've even gotten completely stuck from time to time , I think the most notable was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forgot where I was going with that " So to help myself avoid any repeats , I 've been meticulous in my preparation and made sure to have the entire presentation outlined , with a paper backup on hand , to ensure I could talk my way out of any glitches . <p> But that spiraled out of control , since every time I presented I tried to deliver new material , adapted to the theme of the conference . And thus , new supporting material . Not such a hot idea , I found out , as its probably more important to be familiar with your material and comfortable when delivering it , than to be fresh all the time . Not to mention the extra time and effort creating a new set of slides every single time . <p> So recently , I 've realized a few things that I think are making me a better speaker . Ive stopped spending ages coming up with finely-detailed outlines of each presentation , and instead I 'm leaving more to real-time interaction . I 'm still no Veen or Molly , and likely will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own methods now , and I think that 's the real key to presenting well . <p> Know your material . But plan to make mistakes anyway . If you talk through a bunch of slides , oh well . Make them available later , and its no big deal . If you have to back up and provide extra context that you missed earlier , go right ahead . You can even tell people that 's what you 're doing , although you probably do n't  need to . Also , if you 're more of a bullet-point presenter , you can even use your slides as notes to keep you focused throughout . That 's hardly a bad system , though we all know why PowerPoint is evil <p> Nervousness goes away . Five minutes into it , you 'll stop being nervous and start having a bit more fun . And after doing a few presentations , you 'll stop getting those butterflies in your stomach before hand , and feel a lot more at home on a stage . <p> Pause . Get used to taking small pauses here and there , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to slow yourself down , or whatever else . Its okay to have a few seconds of silence . <p> Have a water bottle with you on stage . You 'll need it for the dry mouth . Some lip balm might not be a bad idea either , if you 're talking more than once . <p> If you get stuck on-stage , its not a bad thing . You simply move on to the next topic . The audience might notice , or they might not . A lot of the things you 're thinking internally during that moment will never get picked up by anyone else , so if what you 're saying still makes some form of sense , chances are no one will catch it . ( And if it does n't  make sense , often that 's just glossed over ! Not everyone is 100% coherent all the time when speaking , and it rarely matters . ) <p> Be prepared to allow for spontaneity . You cant really plan for the asides and diversions that you might make while on stage , but allow them to happen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that ties in with your main points nicely , and itll work its way into future presentations . Try to keep yourself always coming back to the topic at hand , or at the very least , make sure to highlight why your diversion is relevant to the discussion . Do n't  spend too long on them , however . <p> Have a lot of slides . If you 're worried about time , just make sure you 've got more material than you need . Chances are you wo n't get through it all , but that 's not a terrible problem to have . I 'd say 40 to 50 slides is probably enough to fill up an entire hour , as that 's just over a minute each . As you get more comfortable , you can start bringing that number down . <p> Be prepared , but its not worth killing yourself . Do n't  go for broke on the slides , go for broke on familiarizing yourself with your topic and your slides . Do three dry runs before you get up on stage . Time yourself , and do n't  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ runs . Learn how to talk your way out of a factual error you just caught , speaking flub , or even just simple mispronunciation . Pretend there 's an audience right in front of you and you only have that hour . This will quickly highlight the problem points , and often itll cause you to re-arrange your slides . <p> If you do n't  fill the entire hour , no big deal . ( If you 're only hitting the 30 minute mark , you might need to have more material next time . ) Q&amp;A can usually fill up the rest of your time slot , and ever since I 've started speaking I 've had more fun answering questions than talking during the actual presentation . Try to make your talk amenable to follow-up questions , and if you 've got a small enough room ( anything over 50 people is pushing it ) you can even encourage questions throughout . <p> Make sure you 've got a strong start , and the rest will fall into place . The first few minutes are the most important . The audience does n't  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they 're like , so you need to get people interested . Plus , the sea of quiet faces is a bit overwhelming , so if you need to script any part of your presentation , this is the best part to script . After you 've gone through the introduction and started getting into the meat of it , people are likely to be more receptive and you wo n't feel so on the spot . <p> Re-use material . I do n't  think there 's anything wrong with this . If you 're giving repeat presentations , feel free to dip into past talks and pull out points . I lean towards illustrated slides instead of bullet points these days , so I 've even built up an illustration library which I 'll happily re-use for new talks , even if the subject matter changes . <p> Of course SXSW is more oriented toward 15 or 20 minutes of talking , so the time frame is a bit different . But chances are sooner or later you 'll need to talk for an hour or so . Hopefully you 'll be a natural , but if not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , though I 'd like to add a few of my own ( and reemphasize a few of the above ) : <p> To #4 ) Water is really important . You cant depend on a stack of cups and water ( though sometimes , they are there ) . <p> To #9 ) There will always be questions , so do n't  worry about coming up short . The only times I 've ended up with a sea of blank faces was the result of losing everyone on about slide 3 or so . One colleague of mine would often break his presentation into four parts : everything important , questions on everything important , everything else , and questions on everything else . The questions in the middle would break the long talk and make sure the most interesting things are covered . Questions always tend to be more interesting , and certainly the most humorous . <p> 1 ) Avoid slides full of text . When the audience is given a slide full of words , they will be furiously writing everything down and no longer listening to you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told me 6 words per bullet , 6 bullets per slide maximum . I 've actually found this to be a really comfortable amount of information to hand out . This of course , is contingent on if your presentation is full of bullet points . <p> 2 ) Note cards . It never hurts to have little blips that remind you of tidbits you want to mention . Though if you go this route , punch a hole on the top left/right and thread them on a key-ring . Dropping even 15 note cards mid-presentation will spell the end of the note card idea . <p> 3 ) If you can , find a presentation buddy . During our larger presentations , Ive grown used to presenting with one of the artists on our team . We play off of each other well , and can cover for each other really easily . If you know you are presenting with someone else , take some time to get to know them and work on things together . This also presents tag-team presenting where halfway through you " tag out " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your presentation buddy is a great person to present to when you run through the first couple times . <p> 4 ) Find your " style " . During your run-through and after your presentation , take a few minutes and reflect on what did and did n't  work for you . A lot of times , the first reaction was " phew its over ! " and then things move on . By stopping at some point to look at what you liked doing and what you did n't  , you 'll start to carve out your own style . <p> I attended both of your presentations at this years Web Design World in San Francisco and I really enjoyed your presentation style - it was a good balance of keeping everything structured and understandable , while still leaving wiggle room for questions or spontaneous add ins . <p> In regards to this list , I think you 've forgotten one of the most important aspects of any presentation : have fun with it . Nobody wants to feel like they 're sitting through Calculus 101 again . <p> I think too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their presentations that the whole experience comes off feeling dry and without life . <p> Its interesting that you suggest 40-50 slides for an hour . My favourite talks / lectures ( and the ones I try to emulate when presenting ) are the ones where the speaker is so engaging that the slides pale into insignificance , so it does n't  matter if there are far fewer than that . <p> I 've always thought that they should be there for the speaker to hang their ideas on , not as reading material for the audience . I 'd be sad if I thought my slides were more interesting than me ! <p> Great articles , Dave . This is the first time I 've posted here , but I 've been lurking for a long time : - ) <p> I think one of the key things Ive learned about successful presentations comes from my experience as a teacher . At the end of a good presentation the audience should feel as though they 've been taken on a bit of a journey - good presentations need to have a destination . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this in mind , and almost always start at the end and work my way back . I ask myself " where do I want the audience to be when Im done talking ? " Once I 've figured this out , I step back and try to figure out how to get the audience there , step by step . <p> I think slides are like makeup . You can do a great presentation without them , but used sparingly and in the right amounts they can really help bring a presentation alive . Too much , however , and you can risk ending up with an overblown mess . <p> I personally look at slides like visual emphasis - you use them to augment a point , but just like bold text you do n't  want to be augmenting everything or else itll all start to blur together . <p> 1 . Do n't  eat heavily beforehand . Any food you may have to process during your presentation takes blood away from your brain to think clearly , so its best to be a little hungry . <p> 2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't  like water , at least stay away from stuff like orange juice or anything else thatll roughen up your throat . Also stay away from anything with milk milk has chemicals in it that cloud your mind , and a clear mind is important for a presentation . <p> I 've not had the fortune to attending your Geek Dinner in London , but I heard from friends who did that you were very relaxed and natural about it . <p> All above are great reads . Great examples are Steve Jobs Keynotes ; his slide simplicity is the heart and soul of why his presentations are so fantastic . Study his Keynotes and you 'll learn so incredibly much . <p> I would recommend joining Toastmasters for people who want to improve their speaking skills . While the speeches rarely last for more than 10 minutes , its still a great opportunity and a " safe " place to make all your beginner mistakes . <p> Great tips , Dave , and commenters ! A topic near and dear to my heart . And , having spoken together with you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cogent speaker with lots of interesting things to say . <p> Obviously , comfort level is different for people . No joke : Most people offered the choice of death or public speaking choose death ! This is why the Veens of the world are great speakers - they are themselves and comfortable in front of people . I never have the jitters or fears of any kind because I adore being the center of attention and seek it out with glee : ) My only concern , always , is that I serve the audience well . <p> But even with my natural enjoyment of being on stage , I have been confronted with many challenges over the years . I was helped a lot through private speaker training , which I decided was an important step toward becoming a professional speaker . Not everyone who speaks professionally does this , but if you 're really thinking about speaking in public a great deal , I 'd say a few sessions with a good speaking coach or attending a few Toastmaster meetings is terrific . <p> One very fascinating piece I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ success has little to do with your slides , your voice , or your jokes . It has to do with how you use your body . Body language is the most important facet of speaking because via our bodies we can draw focus to or away from us or our materials , deal with the dynamics of Q and A more successfully . A great example is if you are answering a question , turn your face to the questioner but your body away from them and toward the rest of the room . This keeps people from feeling left out of the conversation . Also , the tendency is to move toward a person asking a question ( called " compression " ) . Do n't  ! Move slightly back from the audience , further opening the physical environment so everyone feels included . <p> Doing audience polling is a fantastic way to start out a presentation too , raising your hands as you ask the question . This gets physical energy going from the get-go , as well as getting people involved right from the start . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How many people consider themselves visual designers ? " and raise my right hand . Then , on the next question , such as " How many people consider themselves Web developers ? " I switch hands . Then , even if time is short , I 'll ask for three volunteers to quickly introduce themselves , say what their job title is , and find out a particular item they are frustrated with - this not only warms people in the room toward you and each other - but gives you an idea of the level of general focus and skill . <p> I could go on , but I 'll leave it with this one golden rule : Repeat audience questions . No matter if they are speaking into a microphone , always repeat the question before answering it . This also keeps everyone feeling included as well as ensuring that everyone hears the question and a conversation is created , rather than a monologue or dialogue . <p> There are always the additional topics that get raised in audience questions or just naturally as you go through a presentation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interesting , let me get back to you , " or " That would be a great topic when I write Part 2 of this presentation . " Depending on the talk format , you should have some way to record these ideas . If its a small lecture setting , you can simply keep a list on a writeboard , or in a larger setting , your " presentation buddy " can take notes . Your buddy should also help you afterwards with any style or behavior issues ; if you co-present , do it for each other . <p> Mollys comment about repeating questions reminded me of something else I think is very important . In un-miked situations , make sure you always talk to the person furthest away from you . If someone near you mumbles a question , repeat it and answer it so that everyone can hear you . Showing this kind of consideration for your audience improves your image and helps you remember how important each individual audience members experience is . <p> Slides can help you an awfull lot in timing your speach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subtract 3 minutes for starting and ending the speach propery . That leaves 12 minutes , so 12 slides . <p> Each slide has got a title and 3 bullets , with a keyword or small phrase on it . If I can cover each bullet on each slide in 20 sec. on average my timing works out . 20 seconds is just enough time to say three lines or one and a pause . <p> Dave M : Awesome point regarding feedback . If you 're speaking at a conference and they ask for detailed feedback on speakers , make sure you read that feedback . It can be painful at times , sometimes you 'll get criticized for things that do n't  make sense or you simply wo n't agree with , but the audience can be your best friend in terms of your own growth . And when those yummy comments come in , like " GREAT JOB ! " well , it just feels so good . <p> I am leaving this web site now or I 'll be here all day ! I love talking about talking : ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What I mean is , very often I come to give a talk and what I have is a computer with a projector and a web browser , and that 's it . I have my notes ( or not , depending on how well I know what I 'll talk about ) and then just go . <p> I like to be able to go to places I was n't expecting , to respond to the audiences interests , or to go into greater depth than I was expecting on a particular matter . Its sort of the opposite of Larry Lessig and Dick Hardts approach of many , many slides , with one graphic or word on each , impeccably timed to what they have to say which is also effective . <p> That does n't  mean I think slides are bad , in other words . I just think that most slides people use , which are really PowerPoint outlines of their talk , are useless . My father-in-law gave a talk once about dental technology ( he s a retired dentist ) , and he was freaked out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should forget about PowerPoint ( so should most people ) and just pick some images to go along with his talk . The result is here : <p> **41;716;TOOLONG <p> It went great . And there were no bullet points . I think each speakers style suits different styles of visuals . <p> If you want to hear how I sound when I give a presentation ( minimal slides ) , try this : <p> LONG ... <p> Two tips I have : <p> - Move around . Get away from the podium . Stride . Look at the audience . Use your hands . If you have a lot of demo stuff at the computer , have NON-demo stuff that let 's you get away from it . <p> - Stand to the audiences left of the screen ( your right ) . Most people in the West read from left to right , so they will look at you , then the screen . <p> re : Avoiding slides . I think that 's fine if you can get away with it , and if your talk is more **25;759;TOOLONG @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visual aids to explain things like floats and the box model , though . My slides are mainly imagery these days anyway , with very minimal text , and often a page of links as footnotes . <p> A question that occured to me that some of you may have dealt with if you DO NT have slides , does the audience grant you the same credibility ? Slides make it look like you 've prepared in advance , winging it without them might cause a different perception . That 's something I 'd wonder about were I to drastically drop my slide count . <p> As far as dispensing with slides goes , I think it depends on a few factors : <p> 1 . How long your presentation is 2 . How complex or involved your subject material is 3 . Whether or not your material is rooted in the visual 4 . How inherently interesting your subject is 5 . How inherently interesting you are <p> I think if you have a long , complex presentation , you had better have the verbal part of your presentation down cold ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an audiences interest with a long , complex presentation is a challenge even if you 're got an interesting subject and slides . <p> Its like a singer singing a capella ( yes , I 'm full of analogies ) - it can be done , but you better be absolutely amazing as every flaw , every mistake , and every nuance is going to be completely evident . <p> Besides presenters who read their slides , the one thing that annoys the crap out of me ( and I 've been guilty of this too ) are presenters who are obviously not totally prepared , and come in and say , " I want this to be a conversation , so I want to talk less and hear what you have to say . " <p> I think everyone has their own approach to slides , no one formula works for all speakers or all presentations . The only thing which really does n't  seem to work is overloading slides with information . <p> Ultimately Ive found the best presentations come from a speaker who gives the impression they could do the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are confident enough to let their passion for the topic shine through . Anyone who has been to Web Essentials can probably instantly think of five speakers who fit the bill : ) <p> Ive been running a knowledge sharing group at work for the past two years ( a group for web developers at a university ) . My role largely consisted of chasing people up to speak at the meetings . I was amazed to find just how reluctant most people are to speak to a group - even a small , friendly group like ours ! It just had n't  clicked for me since I do n't  have that level of fear ( a little nervousness is natural , keeps you on your toes ) . <p> The interesting thing was that most people do just fine once they stop worrying and start talking , particularly on topics they care about . <p> Great collection of presentation basics . From my experiences , I would like to add a few things : <p> - if you do not know the background or expectation of people , try @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot of opportunities to refer to during your presentation and even makes a standard presentation more " customer " -focussed <p> - be careful with jokes or humor ; not everyone has the same sense ; some might find it boring , unappropriate or even offending <p> - stories you experienced yourself are always a good thing to tell ; they make you authentic and prove that your presentation is relevant to practical issues <p> - if possible do a dry-run of your presentation with people , who know both your target group and the topic you are talking about ; this helps to find the most common errors and/or missing links in your chain of logic ; you will also get used to your presentation - and not do it first time , when it really matters <p> - I categorize all of my slides into " must deliver " , " should deliver " , and " would be nice to deliver " . I scatter time points throughout my presentation , such as by slide 10 I should be at 25 minutes , and slide 20 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watch the time - if I 'm ahead , I spend more time on " would be nice " - if I 'm behind , I stick with " must " . Its tricky to do this , but if there is a lot of audience participation , you can often use this as a chance to regroup . <p> - I create an awful lot of slides , and actually present very few . Many of my powerpoint slides are merely structure for what I have to say . An outline , if you will . What I actually write on powerpoint and what I think will add value to the audience by displaying them are two different things <p> - My goal for any presentation is " what do I want my audience to DO as a result of this presentation ? " Anything short of that goal makes the presentation unnecessary . if you just want to inform them , write an article and hand it out . <p> - The single most powerful tool in Powerpoint - the " B " key ( it makes the screen go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point that is critical - hit the " B " key . Then say " Now , this is VERY important " . Just the shock of the screen going blank brings every eye in the room back onto you . <p> Tomorrow I have my first ever public presentation - a seminar on blogging and communities . Its 45 minute slot . <p> The advice in this post and the comments is excellent , and I hope I can remember it all . But one thing springs to mind . <p> Ill be making sure that , at the start , people are aware that they will receive electronic copies of my presentation . Ive been to conferences where the same has happened and it immediately removes the need to frantically scribble down notes from the displayed slides . <p> Love the " B " tip , will be using that and Molly - some excellent advice on body language that I had n't  considered . <p> I may even point to this post as an excellent example of how blogging works ! <p> I was a comfortable speaker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ integral in teaching a better way to public speak . <p> He would n't let us read directly from paper . And he abhorred " memorization . " The human brain can only memorize so much , and then it gives up . He contended that this WOULD happen during a public speech and leave the speaker 10 times more anxious than they were to begin with . So , much to the chagrin of the majority of the class who saw notes as security blankets , he banned reading from paper or memorization . Instead , he taught us " speaking on the fly . " <p> You take your topic , research it and follow this simple formula : 1 . Tell them what you 're going to tell them 2 . Tell them it 3 . Tell t hem what you just told them . <p> You use small notecards to put in brief points about what you 're telling them , and you learn to adjust on the fly your intro and conclusion . <p> For the security seekers who clung to paper , it shattered their world , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their comfort levels with public speaking increased because they were ALLOWED to make mistakes . The structure ensured they did n't  go off on tangents but gave them flexibility to make changes and engage in a more animated " discussion " than a stoic speech . Audiences , in general , appreciate this . Because you repeat yourself 3 times ( but you mix up how you do ) their memory retention of the message at hand increases greatly . <p> I think a common theme emerging here is that the more natural and spontaneous you can make your speaking , the better it will come across to everyone . Which is exactly what I 've discovered for myself . <p> Carsten in particular ( #18 ) raised some great points I missed knowing your audience is tricky , do what you can to find out in advance . Personal stories are a huge win , if told well . You humanize the presentation , and its easy enough for you to tell them since they happened to you . And planned jokes almost always bomb ( or at least they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't  think people would find that funny that get the biggest laughs sometimes . <p> When you feel comfortable with your material you can talk WITH your audience not at them . <p> While everyone is there to hear you , when the opportunity arises to interact with people it eases any tension you might have about speaking . Its like having a conversation where everyone wants to listen to you and you do n't  have to fight for air time ! -g <p> These same tips can be applied to those who run Podcasts ( I say that because I do one myself ) . During the first few episodes I had found that just having a small outline in front of me helps tremendously to simply just stay on task . <p> In earlier shows there was plenty more " ums , hmms , and uhhs " than I anticipated . That was only revealed to me after the fact . <p> On the flip side , I do in fact think one can be a bit too slow pausing for the sake of thinking you 're going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of hand . It will indeed take away part of my personality if I chose that route . Its nice to let people know that you 're human and you too have a thought process and verbalizing that is n't all that bad . <p> Great tips . What I would love to have is my notes on the computer screen in front of me and my slides on the projection screen that the audience can see . Does anyone know if there any way of doing this without having a two-screen set-up ( not available in most conference venues ) ? <p> I 'm strongly in favour of new material for each session . However , I charge for that , which means I 'm more expensive , which means I have fewer sessions ( and none of that **25;786;TOOLONG nonsense anymore ) . <p> Do n't be afraid to swear onstage if necessary . I have , however , never gone beyond two syllables . <p> While having notes on one screen and slides on another is good , do n't  forget that a simple paper outline or ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well or better . <p> Oh , and another point : confirm and reconfirm and re-re-confirm what equipment and connectivity there will be at the venue . Then prepare for any of it , or all of it , to be missing . <p> I have had to give talks about websites where there was no Internet connection , even though I 'd been promised and re-promised , and re-re-promised one , and was only able to pull it off by caching a bunch of examples on my laptop in advance , just in case . <p> In a worst-case scenario , you can make do in a smallish room with just a whiteboard or a flip chart and some pens . I 've occasionally planned it that way : <p> Now , if you do n't  get the gear you were expecting , you can just say , " Well , I cant do this " or stand around waiting for some AV helped to rush stuff in for you . But if you are well prepared and can semi-wing it with what you do have , you 'll make an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or an Internet connection , and my laptops battery just died because there 's no power strip up here , but I 'm going to get started anyway . " <p> If you can give a good talk like that , you 'll ( a ) blow em away when you do have what you need , and ( b ) get asked back , if that 's what you want . <p> Another from direct , painful personal experience also make sure your slides are backed up in at least three places : your laptop/presentation computer , a USB drive , and the internet . ( And if you 're using Keynote , export them to something thatll work on a PC . ) <p> Chances are good your computer wont die on you a few hours before you go on stage , but I 've had that happen . Backups are essential , as is the ability to port your slides over to another platform if that 's all that 's available . ( More of a Keynote issue , I 'm sure Powerpoint users are safe ) <p> Some great advice , especially about preparing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fun . <p> I will heartily disagree with two of your points , however . First , using 40-50 slides as a backup for being nervous is a poor solution . In my experience , fewer slides are better . For an hour presentation , no more than 10 slides or so , and ONLY if they illustrate a point better than you can say it . In short , more slides wont make you less nervous ! <p> Also , with regards to timeif you do n't  know how long your presentation will take , you have n't prepared . " Preparing " is n't just writing out a talk ; its actually saying it OUT LOUD , real-time at least three times , just as if you really had an audience . If you do n't  know EXACTLY how long your talk takes , then you have n't rehearsed it enough . <p> Having seen Dave in action I can say that despite him not being the funny man , the illusionist or the evangelist he does just fine . <p> here 's why . First up his credentials precede him - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That leads me to my second point - the audience WANT to hear you . I do n't  care if you stumble a bit I really do n't  . Be yourself and remember you are amongst friends . <p> The only thing that ever frustrates me is when I 've paid good money and I do n't  get all that was promised . Timing is all , the rest will largely take care of itself I believe . <p> Just a few years past , I was pursuing a History major , and it just so happened that the courses I was taking required a lot of speaking in front of groups of people " something I always dreaded and generally bumbled . No matter what I tried , I was always nervous , fidgeting , clammy " and it would always reflect on the presentation . <p> I soon realized History was not the path for me , and I eventually gave in to my inner nerd and started taking design classes ( heck , I needed some kind of excuse to buy a mac ) . <p> Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot more . And you know what ? The only times I 'm ever nervous presenting " whether its to a class or a client " is when I personally do n't  believe in what I 'm selling . That 's why I could never convincingly pitch the French Revolution or Louis Riel " I did n't  care : I did n't  believe . <p> So while I may not be delivering speeches at world-class conferences , I think its still important to note that as long as you 're passionate about what you 're preaching , your audience is bound to pick up and feed off the energy , regardless of whether or not you keep up to or fly pass your slides . <p> My first career was aimed at the theatre industry , having studied both stage performing , and then focussed on the backstage production work . A voice coach once dispensed advice that has proved invaluable : forget water , eat a bananna . <p> There is something about water that never fully quenches your thirst and takes away the dry-mouth feeling . If you take just a single @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leave you free to speak clearly and comfortably . <p> A performer in a small caberet-style production ( lots of singing required ) showed up at the performance with almost no voice . The bananna was litterally the only thing that kept the show from being cancelled . <p> Over the years I have made many presentations to small and large audiences and this little piece of advice has always served me well . Of course , I keep water with me too , but I rarely need it . <p> I 'm a voice &amp; presentation skills trainer - the voice work I do is based upon the technicues used by the Royal Shakespeare Company - and I need to add a cautionary note about point number four . <p> Water on stage is n't a good thing for your voice ; if you need it for lubrication in your mouth , its too late ! You should have drunk more water BEFORE the gig . ( It can be useful as a prop , to give yourself time to think though : ) ) <p> In fact , drinking on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , making you more and more dependent on using water more and more . As it evaporates it takes the mouths natural moisture with it . <p> In any case , as your vocal folds are working at aboutg 150 times per second ( for a guy ) , why would you want to put something cold like water anywhere near them ? ! ? Youd not take a cold shower after playing a hot game of squash would you ? ( Go on , admit it , you like a hot shower , do n't  you ? ) <p> The " propper " advice is to drink plenty of liquids early ( not tea , coffee , cola , fruit-juice or alcohol ) to give you body time to prepare itself . 
@@99593483 @3793483/ <p> On semantic markup , conveying its usage to those who generally do n't  need to care , and a reusable markup guide for your enjoyment . <p> This is how I like to define the term semantic markup : <p> Semantic Markup is the result of using ( X ) HTML elements for their proper , intended usage . <p> This is a pretty limited definition , better examples exist , and its by no means the only viewpoint out there . The terseness is partially the result of HTML being semantically limited to begin with . We do n't  exactly have a rich vocabulary of element types capable of capturing the meaning and nuance behind every piece of text : We have code , but we do n't  have caption ; We have kbd , but we do n't  have childlikescrawl ; We have emphasis , but we do n't  have publicationtitle . And so on . <p> Why care ? Its a good question , one Ive also asked . If you spend time putting semantic markup into a page , there ought to be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Since CSS is able to make any element look like any other element , you wo n't see the result in a visual browser . Its only when you load a semantically-rich page in a text-only browser , or in a screenreader ( or other alternative access device ) when you 'll start to understand the benefit of authoring this way . Additionally , various stabs have been made at extracting the semantics from a document and putting them to more general use . See Mark Pilgrims Million Dollar Markup and Tomas Jogins Hierarchy . <p> XML gets us the ability to work around this limitation , of course . By defining new , semantically rich languages , we can add extra meaning to our documents ( and while were at it , create tools to pull that meaning back out later and actually do something useful with it ) . But that 's strictly tangental , considering the utility of HTML here and now . We use HTML for web pages , so the limitations are something we have to think about . <p> Semantic debates about which element to use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subjective interpretation . here 's a good example : the address element . The spec has this to say : <p> The address element may be used by authors to supply contact information for a document or a major part of a document such as a form . This element often appears at the beginning or end of a document . <p> Then it goes on to list an example with virtual addresses , in this case URIs to the page authors profiles . Presumably , email addresses would be acceptable in this space , but does that hold true for physical addresses ? You may be surprised at how many different individual opinions exist about this , as evidenced by this SimpleQuiz from a year ago . <p> The ambiguity lies in the fact that the term contact information is undefined in the spec , and therefore its left to the users best judgement to fill that in with whatever contact information they deem relevant . So one persons email address is anothers street address , which is yet a thirds PO box , which is a fourths airport locker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The spec is loose enough that it provides guidance , but actual usage is going to determine the most relevant and appropriate ways to use the markup in question . Individual preferences will guide deployment of the elements , and if a consensus is ever formed , so be it . Until then , vive la diffTrence . HTML elements are basic constructs , its up to you to build something with them . <p> But even this gets tricky when you no longer have control of the semantics of a particular document . What happens when you pass your markup on to a client ? Ever worked with a content management system that allows multiple authors to mix and match their own elements for whatever purposes they have in mind ? How often do you find them choosing elements based on how they look , rather than what they mean ? I see more than a few heads nodding . <p> " Just educate your clients " , you may think . I hope you understand why this does n't  always work . As an analogy , compare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ site for a plumbing company , complete with a CMS . You tell them to make sure to use &lt;ol&gt; elements for parts lists , and &lt;h2&gt; elements for product names on their respective pages . 6 months from now , you check the site and find a ton of &lt;br /&gt; elements to separate the list items , and headers in &lt;font size= " 5 " &gt; tags . Doh . <p> In exchange for your work on the site , the plumbing company gives you some advice on your kitchen remodeling . They suggest copper pipes for your water lines running through the exterior walls , with a small length of flexible CPVC inside the house . You decide to go all CPVC because its slightly cheaper . 6 months later , your pipes burst during a particularly cold winter night . Doh . <p> In both cases , a little bit of education goes a long way . In both cases , the client needs to take a little initiative of their own to ensure higher quality . In both cases , there will be people looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expert . <p> Simply , you cant assume the client will care unless the task they need to perform is personally relevant to them . Education can only go so far , there has to be motivation . But that does n't  mean its not worthwhile to try anyway ; the site may be delivered to a single person or company , but after that it will be used by a far wider audience who will benefit from proper semantics . That 's why its important to care about semantics , as a web designer/developer , and at least try to convey some of that importance to your client . <p> To that end , I 've recently started work on a rough style guide that I distribute to clients as a part of my completed deliverables . This is a single HTML document , marked up with both examples and descriptions of various elements . It also serves as a palette of sorts , graphically depicting the various elements when rendered in the sites style sheet ( assuming the CSS file has been linked . ) Its a rough start , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the education process ( and easy to re-use ) that I 've been relying on it since I wrote it . <p> Here it is , the mezzoblue Markup Guide , available in formatted and bare-bones unformatted flavours , with a permanent home in the Downloads section of this site . Feel free to use , edit , and share alike . I 'd love to see this expanded and improved upon by all of you , with revisions released under the same CC license . <p> ( Wohooo ! First comment . I was refreshing my browser because my internet was n't connecting , and then , BAM you posted : -p ) <p> I think its good someone is still posting interesting content , Dave . <p> Well , do n't  you think that 's one of the strengths of ( X ) HTML , though ? Its interperatable to quite a large degree . I mean , come on , if we had to have a different kind of header for each site , it would be ridiculous . We would have 40 elements just for headers . <p> Also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ semantic headers debate , but on your example page it says H1s are reserved for page titles . Why ? Do newpapers or books , which are the most common header-using .. things .. in print , use one header per page ? No ; they use it when context changes . Do you see what I 'm saying : creating a new page should n't be the only way to change main topic . <p> Dave , thanks for the HTML guide Ive been meaning to put something like that together for a long time myself . <p> I know what you mean about trusting clients to do what you tell them ; the worst is the sites I 've done with Macromedia Contribute as a CMS ; I usually try to lock down a lot of stuff so they ca n't wreck the layout system Ive come up with , and then end up getting a phone call saying " How come I cant change the font ? " : ) <p> I generally like to try to use the CMS to make something as foolproof as possible , though ; when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , I used some of Movable Types customization features to make it as simple as possible for him to enter stuff . A good example is his book reviews I told him to upload the photo into the " Entry Body " field , and the actual review into the " Extended Entry " field , then put the link to Amazon in the " Excerpt " field . A bit of a hack , but it guarantees that everything gets linked properly , and makes it very simple for him to maintain . <p> I havent had to actually do any maintenance on his site in the half year or so its been up , other than tweak the comment CGI a bit to try to keep out the dumber spammers <p> Nothing ground-breaking here , but the style guide is a nice deliverable that keeps you ahead of the curve ( and its nice that doing this once will save you work on future jobs many , many times ) . Well thought-out post . I usually end up sitting down with the person or people that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a handwritten html cheat sheet . I think you 've inspired me to sit down and make a proper one now . <p> Good article , but it still does n't  give the designer much " ammunition " when arguing the point of semantics . The plumber analogy was pretty close , except that we see a problem with our cheaper choice within a few months , but the plumber may NEVER see a problem from using &lt;font&gt; and &lt;b&gt; . <p> I 'm all for semantics , and try to steer my clients down the right path when it comes to updating their site , but unfortunately the only thing clients care about ( for the most part ) is what LOOKS right , not what IS right . <p> Can anyone think of any real-world , IMMEDIATE examples of why we should use semantically structured HTML ? <p> Hunox : I like the idea of a wiki of documentation for clients ( with an open license ) that we can all create and borrow freely from . I 'm too busy to spearhead such a thing at the moment , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " it still does n't  give the designer much " ammunition " when arguing the point of semantics . " <p> Completely agreed , this is still a problem . As I say , the benefits are largely unseen . There are very few ways to extract semantics out of a document at the moment that create enough motivation for the average web designer , let alone client , to start writing better markup . <p> were it not for the fact that ( the ones Ive seen anyway ) just rely on collections of classed spans or attributes like rel . I generally tend to think that classes/ids and attributes do n't  convey semantic information like HTML elements do , although microformats more or less imply that they do . It could be a case where the usage dictactes development though , and given enough momentum perhaps eventually classes WILL one day be considered semantic . I 'm not sure how I feel about that right now . <p> The article I wrote is more geared toward getting designers to understand the idea of truly content-driven design . I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not just clients , as I found the biggest stumbling block in /designers/ truly understanding the power of CSS and semantic markup is simply the lack of knowledge of what is really possible with semantically marked up content . <p> Thanks for the download Dave ! I like the snippet about abbr and acronym as well . I know enough designers that cant agree on the differences ( myself included ) to know better than to try and explain it to a client , but I do applaud the effort ! I have to admit that using DocBook in my day job leaves me wishing we had a more robust way to markup our content without having to resort to XML . Write once display anywhere . Someday <p> Dylan , your article touches on some of the stuff a programmer I work with and I were talking about the other day <p> We were talking about how a lot of designers see the technical aspect of a database driven site as the opposite of what they do , but in reality , if you have a chance to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the visual structure a designer creates often mirrors the logical structure of the database driving the site . CSS-styled semantic code is sort of the in-between , where the data structure and the visual design come together . <p> What I often find is that the semantics influence the way I design a site sure , you can make an H2 heading look different in different div layers , but if you want all the H2s to have the same proportional weight in terms of importance , you 'll probably end up choosing a similar font treatment for all of them across the site . <p> Coding a site semantically as you build the visual look is a great way to keep in mind what is really important to present visually to the end user its gotten to the point that when I start building a site in Illustrator , I even use a layer structure similar to the overall structure of the site . <p> Nice work Dave . The style guide is the item that we all know we should provide but often times , we treat it as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all . Your guide is concise , easy-to-follow and really quite essential for the long-term maintenance of the site . <p> That said , I 'm still not entirely convinced of the importance of perfect semantics in 2005 . In 2010 , maybe . In 2005 , not so much . You mention that the benefit is largely for assistive devices and I agree in that generally having a bunch of marked up headlines to scan over is a good thing , but I feel like the general ordering and cleanliness of the code and contents is more helpful to assistive devices than marking up every single abbreviation and citation and blockquote perfectly . In the end , both are important , but I just wonder how far tags actually go in creating a great user experience if a lot of other stuff is n't specifically tailored for a non-graphical browser . <p> The other alleged benefit of semantic markup is that believers in the Semantic Web claim that machines will eventually be able to derive meaning from web pages in an intensely accurate way via the interpretation of tagged content . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if it materializes , we likely wo n't see until 2010 or so . Maybe then , maybe never . <p> I find myself in terrible trouble when I write essays , because I am seemingly unable to outline . Its not that I cant do it , simply that I find its easier to just transcribe exactly what is in my head and leave it to the reader to intuitively understand what I mean . <p> That 's where the problem I see in teching clients how to write syntactically correct and consistant code . Unless they 're an eccentric web design enthusiast , they probably are going to try to write like theyd write an essay " assuming the reader understands the gist of what each piece of information means . <p> ( Unrelated , there 's a bug firing on your content guide " in Firefox 1.0.4 when you hover the cited link , it causes the markupguide div to become a tad anorexic . No idea why it happens , but its strange . ) <p> This is good stuff , Dave . I like that you call out specific @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> As for " ammunition " for semantic markup " agreed that the case is a little weak right now . Perhaps the simplest argument you can make is that semantic markup integrates nicely with CSS . If you want to change the style of all your table captions , its easy to do so if you have been consistently using the caption element . Of course there 's no *technical* reason why you could n't use spans and classes , but then you have to reinvent your own syntax every time . When the language hands you a nice clean label , why not use it ? <p> I 'm also seeing the same ordered list glitch as Robert Hahn . I 'm using Safari 1. x on Panther . <p> The key point here being the meaning in language bit . We should use semantic language to give our *documents* meaning , as oppose to our displayed pages . The reason we should so this is to make life easier for everything that uses our code . <p> This really ties in with what Richard is saying above re : ammunition for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ markup is semantic then browsers stand a much better chance of rendering it as you intended they should . As do PDAs , WebTV etc etc . Just as importantly , there 's good indicators to suggest that search engines find working with semantic code easier which could improve your site rankings . Lastly , I would think that if you compared a page coded with semantic markup with the same page written in non-semantic markup then the semantically written pages would be faster loading . <p> All of which is a long way of saying that if we give our markup as much meaning as possible we stand a greater chance of having that meaning interpretted more accurately and faster . <p> In your " Markup Guide " , you in fact abuse markup by trying to demonstrate each element with its own markup - for example , by enclosing " var " in " var " tags . That 's not only contradictory , its counterproductive . <p> Some people ( Anne ) are moving back to SGML HTML . But I 'm starting to think it is time to move @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having trouble converting a powerpoint slide to HTML . I decided on a whim to just make up my own tags and use CSS . It just worked . in MSIE6 , Mozilla Firefox , and Opera . If you do n't  care about browsers released more than four years ago , then IE6-compatible markup and CSS would be safe . The only questions are MIME and some CSS compatibility issues . Is it time for just using XML now ? <p> This is just great , thanks Dave ; its gon na save me a lot of time teaching some people how to write basic ( and correct ) HTML . I was recently thinking of doing something like that for my own use but now there 's no need to . You may also want to cover the fact that a Definition Term can have more than one Definition descriptions ; ) Do n't  get it any more complex with tables etc , its just gon na look like another Tutorial and will scare people away , if needed just add the img tag . Well done again . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incorrect technical statements ( like dds not being children of dts ) , but I think we should n't overlook the primary audience here . CMS users , clients we can assume people with little technical experience , so if the guide goes on about sibling elements you can bet you 're going to lose your reader . As it is , it gets the point across . <p> On the real-world , immediate gain of using XHTML and semantic language , its mostly going to depend on who you 're trying to convince . Lately Ive been pointing to file size , search engine indexing , and accessibility as the key reasons . But if your client does n't  care about those things then what are you going to do ? The truth clearly is that nothings going to happen to a site that uses tables and inline styles for everything . How do you convince someone not to use a shortcut when they do n't  identify any of the downsides as downsides ? There are always going to be the knuckle-heads ( technical term ) that do n't  listen to reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ microformats , but I see you 've already mentioned them <p> Another point is CMS . After some flirting with WYSIWYG editors in CMSes ( HTMLArea and alike ) I came to conlusion that all this is no good . For now my choice is solutions like Markdown or Textile . When someone writes conent let him concentrate on content with some basic , intuitive , email-style markup . One doent have to mess up with ( X ) HTML , be it WYSIWYG or hand coded way . <p> " Can anyone think of any real-world , IMMEDIATE examples of why we should use semantically structured HTML ? " <p> Search engines . Screen readers . PDAs . Internet TV . Mobile telephones . <p> The majority of the above do n't  support CSS , and those that do barely scratch the surface in terms of depth of supported features . <p> " I decided on a whim to just make up my own tags and use CSS . It just worked . in MSIE6 , Mozilla Firefox , and Opera . If you do n't  care about browsers released @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CSS would be safe . The only questions are MIME and some CSS compatibility issues . Is it time for just using XML now ? " <p> Ive been flirting with a similar idea - primarily , I 've been playing with creating DocBook-XML " article " and " refentry " documents and just handing them off to a browser with some CSS . Common support is almost there ( support for numbered section headings is still a little shaky , and the CSS required for IE " needs work " notably , the lack of child selectors means you have to be particularly careful in places ) , and it wont be ready for commercial-site-use for a very very long time , without some content-negotiation and server-side scripts . <p> Faruk : Totally disagree . It has yet to be proven that good semantics have any effect at all on Google rankings . Google is , for the most part , a **28;813;TOOLONG powerhouse . It looks mainly at URLs , things *between* tags , and relationships between pages and sites . Its algorithms rely a lot more on parsing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessity . They made their name , in fact , by deriving meaning where semantics were lacking : on a web full of sloppy code . There are certainly good reasons to use proper semantics in your code but Google rank is n't currently one of them . <p> Zach : I agree . Its not very productive to toss semantics out the window . I am simply suggesting that as of right now , you should make proper semantics part of your routine because its the right thing to do and it may eventually be of great use not because there are tremendous tangible benefits at this point in time . I 'm just trying to be honest about it here . <p> The dt/dd description has been updated a bit after the comments in here , and ol list items no longer have bullets in place of numbers . ( That they were bullets in the first place is a function of how often I use ol ; for the last year my main stylesheet has styled " #mainContent li " with a bullet , and its never been a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to this as this is a part of what I do as an Intranet Web Designer . <p> I do n't  go as in depth with the descriptions of each element ( due to the experience of the user ) , but I do give a Style Guide to the people I 'm working with to show them what all the possible elements will look like for their respective design . <p> Now , as for CMS , I am currently the CMS : ) What this means is that I end up educating the users who are use to WYSIWYG editing and seemed to be surprised that the designs have no tables . What ? No tables at all ? is usually the most common response . <p> However , I give them the analogy of using Word and how you set the respective styles . Paragraph text , Lists , etc . <p> Once I do that , the users get a better idea of where I 'm coming from . Its not perfect , but its the closest to a CMS we have at the moment . <p> I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm able to comfortable peruse ( not necessarily intensely read ) without a browser . That being said , I agree on not really being able to define it precisely . <p> Richard M n++ " " it still does n't  give the designer much " ammunition " when arguing the point of semantics . " <p> Very easy answer for you : Google . <p> Google loves semantic pages ( as do virtually all search engines , but virtually no client these days asks for " search engine success " but rather , " I want to appear high in Google " ) , and web standards / semantics will very effectively help boost your page rank and search engine results placement . <p> As far as you can do anything on the site itself , to help boost its rank in Google , semantics are THE way to go . <p> " That said , I 'm still not entirely convinced of the importance of perfect semantics in 2005 . In 2010 , maybe . In 2005 , not so much . " <p> Mike , I do n't  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ productive . What will happen ? Will everything suddenly become semantic overnight ? No . We need to discuss and work on our skills until were all coding properly . <p> And anyway , correctly ( and thoughfully ) coded ( X ) HTML IS semantic . <p> Also , I do n't  remember who touched on this , but I think we should start thinking about moving to XML-like HTML . Its so much more clean then the old SGML-like HTML . <p> Mike D : I disagree . I 'm not sure if you work for Google but if you do n't  you seem to be assuming an awful lot about how the algo processes sites . <p> Its well establiashed for example that G uses a fairly advanced form of keyphrase stemming . That 's not a light technology . Any algo that can introduce stemmed keywords can certainly extract meaning from semantic markup . You say its yet to be proven and I agree . However its a redundant point - *everything* is yet to be proven when optimising for search engines . The only things we can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Y or MSN ) own help pages . Does the weight of evidnce favour your view ? I do n't  know . All I do know is that , for me , semantic pages seem to carry more weight in SERPS . If you find otherwise then that fine but I 'd move away from such a definitive position if I were you . <p> Well , Dave , maybe its an oppurtunity , regarding the testing of the effects of semantics on SEO ; someone ( I 'm not important enough : - ) ) , when they redesign a big-ass site , record all of that sites rankings and compare it to before . I 'd think someone would have done this before , though . Also , it would hard to distinguish between more users because of the better design ( word-of-mouth , then search ) , from more users from just SEO . <p> I just figured it out , Dave ! When you post two dashes ( - - ) it messes up your comment preview , because you commented out something which contains the comment . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the comment . <p> Mike D : sorry , what ? Sure , incoming links aid much more in your google ranking , but Google has definitely been favoring clean , semantic sites over nested tables-ridden sites , or frameset sites , and so forth . At least for about a year , now . I 've seen sites without any incoming links show up on Google in the first 10 results , having semantic markup and getting a pagerank of 5 , versus sites with plenty of incoming links , but being frameset sites with horrible markup , pagerank 0 , and hardly appearing in Google . <p> Do good URIs work great in Google ? Yes , definitely . Do incoming links help boost your rank in Googles results ? Yes , definitely . Does semantic markup help you ? Yes , not as much as the previous two , but it does help . <p> I 've found of late that Google is doing a lot with headings , which is exactly what it should do . This is very simple semantic markup making a difference . <p> Rimantas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do anything , and this is no good . Nobody wants people to write a page in pruple Comic Sans and ruin your larefully crafted layout by adding coluns . <p> Another wysiwyg editor has a better approach : Tiny MCE . With this one you can define what the user can do . You can activate or deactivate every button and list . You could choose to simply offer a few buttons with strong and em and a list of predefined styles.http : //tinymce.moxiecode.com/ <p> Sorry Faruk but I call BS on that that one . There is no way a site with zero incoming links will receive a high page rank because it properly uses heading tags . I think you 're confusing two issues here ( and possibly three ) : <p> 1 . First of all , you mentioned framesets a couple of times . Throw that out because obviously that has a negative effect on search engine ranking and has for 10 years . The reason for this is obvious : splitting your documents up abstracts important information to disparate locations . And by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either . Its part of the standard it just generally is n't a good idea unless necessary . <p> 2 . You mentioned sites with plenty of incoming links and PageRanks of 0 . Please show me these sites . The only way I know of that that could happen would be if the site were either completely unreadable or specifically penalized for trying to spam Google . If a site has 5000 incoming links and 50 tables and font tags , its not going to be a zero , sorry . <p> 3 . I think the main confusion here is that " writing semantic markup " and " writing SEO-optimized markup " are not the same thing . The former is an obvious skill which involves following W3C specs and doing all the things that our host Dave so generously spells out on Mezzoblue every week . The latter is not so cut and dry . It involves things like : <p> How far up the page certain words appear . <p> The ratio of a certain word to total words in a page . <p> The proximity of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ title tag and certain meta tags . <p> Both the former and the latter can be considered " writing good code " and the former can certainly lead you in the direction of the latter ( which is a good thing ) but to say that proper semantics in themselves have a dramatic effect on PageRank is just not true at this time . Ask people like Keith Robinson , who have experienced first hand that taking a site from crappy code to clean , semantic code can sometimes even *lower* PageRank . Its not lowered because of good semantics , but rather because the makeup of the page has changed in an SEO-negative way and surprise surprise , the increased " quality " of the code couldnt make up for it . I really wish I could find the page ( but I cant and I 've searched for a few minutes now ) but someone did a bunch of Google tests relating to this exact subject several months ago and found that semantics themselves really had very little effect on PageRank page composition did though . I 'll keep hunting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> So anyway , I guess what I 'm saying is that one shouldnt go around proclaiming that proper semantics have much of a noticeable effect on PageRank because they do n't  appear to . No one has proved they do , and people have so far only proved the opposite that they do n't  . Remember , Google , at its core , does not exist to reward people who write good code . It exists to reward people who write good content . <p> When I was delivering a keynote last year , I referenced the study Mike is talking about in comment #36 - LONG ... - and said that while we once thought semantics were important for Google , evidence suggests otherwise , and that proper markup does n't  necessarily give a site the boost wed hope for . <p> I had an SEO approach me afterwards and give me a tip . He said that , all other things being equal , proper semantics *do* improve a pages ranking . By " all other things being equal " , that meant incoming links etc . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it did n't  have much PageRank to begin with , so the results would be skewed . Were it an existing , well-linked page , the results would be much different . <p> I 'm repeating this as simple hearsay though ; I have n't seen results to back it up . Anyone reading this deal with SEOs ? Can we get some supporting links ? <p> Dave : Excellent . Yep , that 's the article I was referring to . Nothing that the SEO said to you necessarily conflicts with what I 'm saying to Faruk here : It can indeed " matter " just as having a 1.6 Ghz machine over a 1.5 Ghz machine can matter ( although as I said , it has n't  been proven ) . Point being that there are probably at least 20 different factors which can cause the 1.5 Ghz machine to outperform the 1.6 Ghz machine ( RAM , video card , processor type , etc ) . <p> The problem is that in the world , " all other things " are never equal , so all I 'm saying here is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is hardly noticeable at this point . Those who make claims to the effect of proper semantics completely reinventing a pages SEO-effectiveness are being disingenuous in my opinion . <p> " if semantics matter at all to SEO , their effect is hardly noticeable at this point " <p> That 's where I 'm at too . Proper semantics are nice , and will likely help SEO to some degree , but they 're not a huge Google-boost on their own . There are a lot more factors in play that probably matter more . The 1.5/1.6Ghz analogy is great . <p> I 'm certainly willing to revise that opinion in the face of solid testing and analysis , but I 've yet to see any beyond Peter Janes initial piece . <p> Mike : seems you 're definitely right on one thing . I can only find frameset sites with incoming links and a PR of 0 or 1 . No non-framebased sites Ive found ( in a quick 10-minute scan ) have such low PR when they have incoming links , but that does n't  surprise me , as I never said semantic markup @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I did acknowledge the opposite ) . <p> However , I do have one example of a site with " no " incoming links , and a PR of 4 : xhtml.nl This site has no incoming links on www.xhtml.nl , and only incoming links of ITSELF on just xhtml.nl . Yet , this site has a Pagerank of 4 . <p> I stand corrected in that semantics do n't  aid as " much " as I thought they did , but the XHTML.nl example does at least show that there are cases where its definitely not incoming links boosting a sites Pagerank . Whether its the semantic markup of XHTML.nl or something else , I cant quite tell , but its certainly not incoming links . <p> Additionally , Googles been changing their system over the past week , I hear . Who knows what might change concerning this , now and/or in the future . <p> I think there 's only one truly proper way of doing tests for this , and that 's registering 2 new domains , putting the exact same content on each , but one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Same URI structure , no publications of the URLs anywhere , only submit the site to Google for crawling and then , after a week , check the results . Do they both show up ? Does one site show up higher than the other ? <p> Maybe I 'll just do this experiment after the @media conference . Definitely do n't  have time for it before then <p> Mike D : I 'm using someone elses IRC-plugin , I should ask how it works exactly , as I do not know myself . I do know however that its results are reliable as they are the exact same as the toolbar gives . <p> I checked one of the first actual pages from said framesite and it has a PR of 2 , instead of the 1 that the site as a whole , has . <p> Faruk : I 'm conducting some tests as we speak just for kicks . They are similar to the tests Peter Janes conducted , but with a slightly different methodology . I have a pretty high PageRank to begin with so hopefully what the SEO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issue here . I 've actually wanted to do this for quite some time but just never got around to doing anything too scientific . <p> As for the " xhtml.nl " example you gave , I reckon that sites PageRank might come from the fact that there are 1450 references to the term " xhtml.nl " on the web , and that is the exact domain of the site you 're talking about . Domain character matches do a lot for PageRank . <p> Do keep us ( or me , at least ) up to date on the details of your tests . Daves ( not DaveS ) idea of a wiki about such things might have some merit , though I think a well-written article that takes all of our tests into account fully is more useful .. <p> As for XHTML.nl - I see . Well , it seems then that Google severely punished frame-based sites , because the main frame-based site I was using for comparisons has 19,000 mentions in google on just the domain without TLD , and 17,500 on the domainname with TLD . Still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 800 incoming links . <p> Faruk : What tool are you using to check PageRank , out of curiosity ? I do n't  think that Google actually physically punishes framed sites ( unless they do other things to get themselves punished ) , but generally an *actual* frameset page will receive a low PageRank because there 's simply nothing to index . There 's not even a body tag in a frameset page no content either , unless the site uses the **33;843;TOOLONG tag . Have you tried checking the PageRank of any individual frames within the site ? That is , documents with actual content in them ? <p> Anyone got any pointers on how to handle dates on a webpage ? The common way is wrapping them in the semantic-pointless &lt;span&gt; ( or in some cases a div ) . headers are out of the question , so are all paragraph entities .. So , what to do ? <p> Regarding comment 37 - LONG ... - I never really followed up on the " study " ( which is a generous term : as I wrote at the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " not exhaustive and hardly scientific " ) . The current results suggest there might be something to semantics and Google after all though : while the first link is still to plain old text , the rest are in what I 'd deem the " correct " order , with no detectable difference in PageRank . <p> From my experience semantics are very low on the priority list . I just believe search engines have way too much processing to do to worry about such fine things as element relationships . They 're purely content hoovers . Referring to Google , the single biggest impact in terms of rank is the quality , phrase and destination of a hyperlink . <p> You could argue simplistic semantics are a factor such as structure but I 've not noticed any discernable rank benefits for improving structure on a site . Web standards certainly improve the content to markup ratio which may have more impact but an awful lot more research would need to go into it before giving semantics a top 10 tip for search engine traffic 30455 @qwx890455 30451 @qwx890451 <p> You are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an entry posted on 30 May , 2005 , to the Range collection .

@@99593484 @3793484/ <h> Posts Tagged 3D <p> As hinted in the comments in my last post , I 've cleaned up my 3D elevation code and released it as a project , source and all . Go check out Elevation to grab Mac and Windows executables , or hit up GitHub to grab the source . <p> This project was a too-perfect alignment of things relevant to my interests . I got a chance to really stretch my legs with Processing , had an excuse to tinker with GitHub finally , spent some serious design time in Photoshop thinking through the site and app UI visuals , designed a high-res app icon , got to play with mapping and GPS software , and it all gave me the motivation to go out and pedal around this beautiful city to create my route data in the first place . Spending a month coding while racking up over 400km on the bike seems like a fairly healthy work/play balance . <p> And happily there 's plenty of fodder in here for future posts , from parsing differing XML formats to building a functional GUI . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be much on the web specifically about tying together Processing and Google Docs , but its fairly simple when you realize the latter has a ton of export options that work pretty easily with Processing . I 'm starting with CSV , though the option to work with XML will likely come in handy down the line . <p> Starting with a spreadsheet filled with a few dozen values , I can get at the CSV with a simple export : <p> The loadStrings function pulls in a local file or a remote URL as a String array : <p> The data exists as strings though , so its probably more useful to convert each value to float() or int() before using it . With the simple CSV file I linked up earlier as a source , I used the basic loop to assign the data points as the radii values for each of a set of spheres plotted randomly along the Y axis , or the height of a set of bars slightly tilted along the X axis : <p> If we were to say the linear-increasing X value @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3D graphs that even Tufte can be proud of . ( Or not . ) <p> I 'm back to dots again . This time Im stacking them in an orderly cube , and with the random palette some of them look pretty darn good . <p> I cant get this one exported into anything usable in a browser for some reason ; the applet that Processing creates just does n't  want to run . I suspected the photos I 'm using to generate the palette are to blame , but after hitting up the troubleshooting guide I appear to be doing everything right . The main symptom ( aside from not running ) is that the exported applet is only sized to 100+100 in the browser , which is a ) wrong and b ) strange . <p> Anyway , in lieu of something you can play with , here are some screen caps : <p> If for some reason you really really trust me , you can download the native applications Processing generates ( Mac OS X , Windows , both around 2.5MB ) and play with them on your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but , they should n't . <p> ( Use the mouse to rotate the cube , press a or z to zoom in and out or the mousewheel , but that 's buggy and you can kind of drag it up and down to reposition , though that does n't  work well either . Hit the spacebar for a fresh palette . Oh , and s will save out a PNG of the current frame if you 're so inclined . ) <p> So after yesterdays Bezier celebration I thought I 'd try a more structured approach and see if I could n't capture some interesting movement . Reducing the number of objects down to 3600 and plotting them along a grid as a start , I got the end points and curves moving along Perlin-assisted paths in kind of a wind-blown look . <p> Still all in 3D space of course , so I saved out a quick capture with some viewpoint shifts and generated palettes . ( With the latter you can pretty clearly see that not everything that 's generated is usable since I have to cycle through a few different palettes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are hard enough to get the hang of in a graphics program with visual handles , but plotting the handles in 3D space is a whole new ball of wax . <p> I played around a bit tonight with about 80,000 of them by rotating from the origin and randomizing both the endpoint and the end handle of each curve with Perlin noise . The results are neat : <p> By keeping track of the coordinates of each line I can manipulate the entire blossom in 3D space , though at 80,000 lines its a pretty slow refresh . I added an animation loop too , to get each line swaying a little ; it works well with a few thousand , but not when the numbers get this high . <p> I 'm also sticking with this photo-generated palette idea ; its a great way to get a bunch of interesting colours in a hurry that do n't  clash too badly . I 've upped the photo pool to 10 , and one is selected randomly each time the palette is generated . Each of the above examples only uses 5 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; the previous example used something like 25 . <p> Okay , the generated palette idea was easier than I thought . Importing the photo into an off-screen buffer and grabbing some random pixel values makes for a fairly quick and easy way of generating an interesting palette . here 's the photo : <p> Ive been playing around with a variation of the radial sketch from my last post that plots a few thousand ellipses along a Perlin-randomized trajectory . I first spent a bit of time converting the ugly coordinate arrays to a cleaner object array , added a custom palette , and then added a bit more control over the view in the form of mouse-enabled 3D rotation and mousewheel zoom . <p> I 'm not done with this sketch yet , I 'm going to try generating a random palette from a photograph if I can get that working . For now here 's a dump of some of the more interesting stills : <p> I 've started light by simply merging some of the sketches from last months workshop . That has mainly meant translating 2D demos to 3D space @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ OpenGL quirks . <p> This applet ( requires Java Virtual Machine ) for instance ; there 's a clear dividing line between the left and right half ; the lines are darker on the left , lighter on the right . This is true no matter whether I use the lights() function or not . No idea what 's causing it . <p> And 3D shapes appear to be slow as molasses . Admittedly I 'm on a MacBook Pro with only a mid-range graphics card , but I 'd expect better results than this . here 's a basic 25 sphere " starfield " , it renders pretty smoothly : <p> But bump it up to 125 and look out : <p> Keep in mind the previous applet draws about 5000 2D lines per cycle , vs. the 125 spheres in the last video , so 2D shapes are clearly a lot less taxing than 3D shapes . But 125 shapes is barely scratching the surface of what I imagined Processing could accomplish , so I 'm clearly missing something . <p> What do the pros do ? I 'm guessing the choice is to either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or fake 3D with 2D objects . Ill have to keep digging into this one . Update : aha , buffering . <p> ( and actually , now that I 'm looking at the movies again , I 'm wrong those are n't  even spheres , they 're just ellipses . No idea why this examples so bad ; I can normally get a few thousand ellipses moving pretty quickly , I guess this is just a crappy example . The point remains when applied to spheres though. )

Lately Ive been more interested in the latter . Frequently Ive caught myself calculating in my head what 750 divided by 3 minus two 10px margins equals . <p> One of the larger problems in working with grids in web pages is that you often cant do much about vertical proportions . Often your content is dynamic , so the best you can do is approximate . Throw in any compensation for font scaling , and its easy to lose any semblance of control over the way a layout expands downward . <p> So the focus is usually on the horizontal layout , which usually means columns . ( Incidentally , if you 're ever wondering why fixed layouts are so popular amongst designers , this has a lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coherent form of grid when you lose control of proportions in both dimensions at once. ) <h> 1 Column <p> As simple as it gets , the one-column layout has been around since the beginning of the web . 1994 gave us a grey background and black Times in a single column running down a browser window , the most primitive one-column possible ( although calling it that is a bit of a stretch . See : an early Yahoo ) . It has evolved nicely since then , and some recent redesigns are putting it to good use . ( See : Garrett Dimon ) <h> 2 Columns <p> The realm of the blogger . Two columns are utilitarian and perfect for presenting content and further **28;878;TOOLONG side-by-side . Popular variations include the fixed sidebar/liquid content area setup ( See : Malarkey ) and the fixed-width , narrower sidebar/wider content area setup ( See : the sadly now-defunct Weightshift ) . <p> Layouts with 2 columns or more force a choice that a single column does n't  : equally sized columns , or varied widths ? Ratios are important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others . Its pretty hard to go wrong with 1:1 widths ( or 1:1:1 , or more ) . Its a little more difficult to choose non-equal sizing because there are no hard rules . You could pick a 5:8 Golden ratio ( in a 750 pixel wide layout , translating to roughly 290px and 460px ) , a 3:4 ratio ( 320px and 430px ) , a 1:2 double square ( 250px and 500px ) , and so on . ( Pleasing rhythmic proportions often share proportions with musical time scales , as you may have noticed. ) <h> 3 Columns <p> Once you add a third column , the options increase . What a third column enables is the possibility of a virtual column , one that is not absolutely defined in the layout , but exists by proxy . Consider this site , for example . On all pages with a sidebar , it appears to be a two-column layout . On the home page , the larger red panels imply the existence of three equal-sized columns . I have n't pushed the possibilities of this third column @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ever feel so inclined . <p> As well , 3 column layouts allow for overlapping elements . Consider the home page of Stopdesign , and how the leftmost two columns are joined by the overlapping featured article . Of course , its theoretically possible to pull this off with only two columns , but I rarely see it done on the web . A 2 column layout has traditionally meant that the content of each column lives in that column , never to overlap . <h> 4 Columns <p> 4 column layouts are where screen size constraints start becoming more obvious . With only so many pixels per column , it rarely makes sense to rely on 4 equal-sized , side-by-side columns on a site . StyleGala redesigned last year to a widescreen format with 4 equal columns ; to compensate , a narrower version exists with 3 columns instead . <p> Not to say the columns need to be equally sized . Josh Dura appears to have made a stab toward a smaller-sized 4 column layout , with 3 skinny columns on either side of a larger content @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so in some places its 2 columns , in other places its 3 . Whew ! ) <h> More Columns <p> 4 columns is hardly the limit though , even within sensible designs that do n't  push the width requirements too hard . Consider B. Adam Howells redesign your screen size determines how many columns you see , up to six . And the entire thing stretches to fill the screen , so its resolution-independent . <p> And you knew I was getting to Subtraction eventually , right ? Khois layout turned heads for more than just its black-and-white sparseness . Subtraction uses an equal-sized 8-column grid , with intelligent overlapping and column arrangement to make it seem quite a bit less . <p> What 's particularly clever about Subtraction is how all elements on the page intentionally fit into the grid . Whether its the Quick Access panel on the right spanning 2 columns , a content image spanning half the page ( 4 columns ) , or a caption sitting in the left-most column , every element on the page has a specific place within the grid and it all meshes wonderfully .

@@99593489 @3793489/ <p> Greyscale is only one method of removing colour from an image , and as it turns out , its an unrealistic way of doing it . The term colour-blind is misleading - almost no one sees in literal black and white ( although that 's tempting to disbelieve at times when debating ) . <p> Colour deficiency is a more descriptive label . There are two main categories of deficiencies ( and a handful of rarities and sub-types ) : <p> Anomalous Trichromacy <p> The least severe , those afflicted are still able to sense most or all colour , but ability to distinguish between them is reduced . <p> Dichromacy <p> Less common , but more severe , dichromats have problems with reds and greens , leaving them swimming in a world of blue and yellowy brown . <p> Referring back to part one , you will recall that value indicates how much light a colour reflects . Blues are darker than yellows , for example ( view sample images ) . In most cases of colourblindness , the values do n't  seem to shift too radically . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afflcited with Protanopia ( a variation of Dichromacy ) see even the brightest reds as dark brown or black . This can very well mean that the viewer of a brightly-lit red stoplight would fail to notice its even on . <p> So let 's apply this to our work then . In part one we discussed the legibility of text , and how value affects the perception of individual colours . Let 's extend that and look at how using value effectively can increase contrast of text and background colour , keeping in mind that there will be some who wo n't be able to view our work with a set of eyes similar to ours . <p> We can start with the basic principles : black on white offers the most contrast , so blue or purple on white is a step down . However , blue and purple both have darker values than , say , orange or yellow , so they offer an intermediate point between full contrast and little to none . <p> Conversely , black text on a yellow or orange background is only a step down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be quite near impossible to read . <p> This applies to saturated colours . The following figure shows instances of orange text on white and black text on purple that actually offer enough contrast for most users : <p> Of course , the preceding examples have assumed full colour capabilities . But theyve also carefully managed to avoid colour combinations that present major problems . The most common trouble spots are red and green , so what of them ? <p> There are two directions these could go . The colourblind viewer might see these with a brightness shift , or without a brightness shift . Both instances can potentially occur , and the results may be different depending on which type of colour deficiency the viewer suffers : <p> Its tempting to think that , because you 're designing for a screen , the light emitted will be enough to prevent the dark variants from occuring . That is to say , even if a viewer ca n't see the hue , they can still see light , and so would be more inclined to see variant A over variant B. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light example from earlier . Red is dark for some , whether its flat colour on a printed surface , or bright red light . <p> So the only hard and fast rule here is that there are no hard and fast rules . You cant reliably predict what the end user will view when using problem colours like red or green . <p> The safest way to ensure your message gets across is , unsurprisingly , by following the WCAG guideline on the matter : <p> Ensure that text and graphics are understandable when viewed without color . <p> If color alone is used to convey information , people who can not differentiate between certain colors and users with devices that have non-color or non-visual displays will not receive the information . When foreground and background colors are too close to the same hue , they may not provide sufficient contrast when viewed using monochrome displays or by people with different types of color deficits . <p> There is one small grey area , ironically . If you use a blue link within a field of black text , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that cant see blue are incredibly rare , and those afflicted have trouble viewing a computer monitor anyway . <h> Further Reading : <p> Causes of Colors Almost everything you could possibly need to know about colour . 30454 @qwx890454 <p> Your first article on colour scales reminded me of hue exercises in art school . I still use one of the tricks I learned to examine colour contrasts for my web designs . Print the design in colour , then photocopy it . If it all goes black , flat gray , or bleaches out , chances are some people will have a problem viewing it . <p> Thank you for all this effort Dave . For some reason when people talk about accessibility they only think of screen readers and other extreme cases . The number of people that have trouble with contrast or colors dwarfs the number that use an SR , and I 'm glad you are drawing attention to them . I am forever haunted by one of my best friends received an F in 4th grade , all because the test asked to map color-coded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ red/green color blindness ( he cant tell the difference between red and green traffic lights ) , made distinguishing the various hues utterly impossible . <p> Weak eyesight and color blindness are the two main reasons I cite when I state that Flash has made ZERO real accessibility improvements . You still ca n't pause movies , you cant change the font size , and you cant change the color palette , these things are all left to the designer , and most budgets do n't  allow for such things . <p> Thanks Dave , colour-blindness is something a whole lot of people are trying to grasp how to design for . It sits squarely in that grey area between users with screen-reader dependence and users with full vision . <p> There is one more area to consider when choosing color and designing for the visually impaired . My office mate uses ZoomText and I was amazed to notice when testing that some text &amp; background combinations broke up and become unreadable when Zoomed . One of her visually impaired students refused to use ZoomText to view the web because he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to 7 or 8 magnification . <p> It seems extreme contrast is often as bad as low contrast in this situation . In playing around we found that a very slightly off-white background or a slightly grayed black on pure white background worked the best . Most of the darker colors worked fine on pure white . <p> Great information here .

@@99593490 @3793490/ <h> Recent Entries <h> CSS Crib Sheet <p> You will no doubt come across many quirky layout issues when building a site with CSS . You 'll end up banging your head against a wall time and again . This is an attempt to make the design process easier , and provide a quick reference to check when you run into trouble . <p> When debugging , you may save yourself a lot of headache by simply validating your code first . Improperly-formed XHTML/CSS will cause many a layout glitch . <p> Build and test your CSS in the most advanced browser available before testing in others , not after . <p> If you build a site testing in a broken browser , your code begins relying on the broken rendering of that browser . When it comes time to test in a more standards-compliant browser , you will be frustrated when that browser renders it improperly . Instead , start from perfection and then hack for the less able browsers . Your code will be more standards-compliant from the start , and you wont have to hack as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mozilla , Safari , or Opera . <p> When relying on floats for layouts , make sure they clear properly . <p> Floats are tricky , and do n't always do what you expect . If you run into a situation where a float extends past the border of the containing element , or just does n't behave as you 'd expect , make sure what you want is correct . Check Eric Meyer 's tutorial on the matter . <p> Margins collapse ; apply padding or a border to avoid . <p> You may struggle with extra white space where you do n't want any , or no white space where you want some . If you 're using margins , collapsing is most likely the culprit . Andy Budd explains what you can expect . <p> Try to avoid applying padding/borders and a fixed width to an element . <p> IE5 gets the box model wrong , which really makes a mess of things . There are ways around this , but its best to side-step the issue by applying the padding to the parent element instead of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Flash of Unstyled Content in IE. <p> If you rely on @import alone for external style , sooner or later you 'll notice IE flashes plain , unformatted HTML briefly before applying CSS . This can be avoided . <p> Do n't rely on min-width in IE. <p> IE does n't support it . But it treats width as min-width to a certain degree , so with a bit of IE filtering , you can achieve the same end result . <p> When in doubt , decrease widths . <p> Sometimes rounding errors will cause something like 50% + 50% to add up to 100.1% , which ends up breaking layouts in some browsers . Try bumping down the 50% to 49% , or even 49.9% . <p> Content not showing up properly in IE ? <p> You may be suffering the Peekaboo bug , especially if it does show up when a link is moused-over . See Position is Everything for the fix . <p> Be careful when styling links if you 're using anchors . <p> If you use a classic anchor in your code ( &lt;a name= " anchor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and : active pseudo-classes . To avoid this , you 'll need to either use i 'd for anchors instead , or style with a slightly more arcane syntax : : link:hover , : link:active <p> Make sure your desired effect actually exists . <p> There are browser-specific CSS extensions that are n't  in the official spec . If you 're trying to apply filters or scrollbar formatting , youre working with proprietary code that wo n't work in anything but IE. If the validator tells you the code you 're using is n't defined , chances are its proprietary , and wo n't work consistently across browsers . <p> Divide and Conquer : use commenting to turn off large sections of style . <p> Especially useful when working on large , unfamiliar CSS files . Comment out roughly half of the CSS . If the problem still occurs , it 's in the other half . Comment out what 's left and test again . If the problem stops occurring , its in the commented out section . Refine your comment scope and test again . Continue until problem has been diagnosed . <p> Remember " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always do so in this order : Link , Visited , Hover , Active . Any other order wont work consistently . Consider using : focus as well , and modify the order to LVHFA ( or " Lord Vader 's Handle Formerly Anakin " , as suggested by Matt Haughey ) <p> Remember " TRouBLEd " borders . <p> Borders , margins , and padding shorthand assumes a specific order : clockwise from the top , or Top , Right , Bottom , Left . So margin : 0 1px 3px 5px ; results in no top margin , 1px right margin , and so on . <p> Specify units for non-zero values . <p> CSS requires you to specify units on all quantities such as fonts , margins and sizes . ( The only exception is line-height , oddly enough , which does n't require a unit . ) The behaviour of any particular browser when sizes are n't specified should not be relied upon . Zero is zero , however , be it px , em , or anything else . No units are necessary . Example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different font sizes . <p> Advanced browsers like Mozilla and Opera allow you to resize text no matter which unit you use .

@@99593491 @3793491/ <h> Archive for the Experimentation Category <p> Seems like Im more inclined to post screenshots of work-in-progress on Dribbble these days , so you can see a few of my current experiments over there . My latest project is remixing older sketches to layer different objects and apply blur and noise filter effects . <p> Blur is relatively simple , Processing has a built-in blur() function that gets the job done . Its slow , and applying multiple blurs per frame really slows down rendering , but its way easier to work with than the GLGraphics library . Ill probably need to dive into the latter eventually , but for now , I 'm happy to let Processing do the heavy lifting here . <p> Noise was simple too , although it took a few attempts to crack . I initially thought I could just use set to drop an array of black pixels on top of the scene , using a random alpha value for the opacity . Except set does n't  appear to like alpha values , as the render would start correctly but then layer up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because the loop would only run once , but there would be multiple frames of noise being applied . I do n't  quite understand that one , but it was enough to convince me to try it another way . <p> Instead what I 'm doing is grabbing the current colour value and using lerpColor to select a random point between it and full black . The amount variable controls how far from the original colour it will deviate , values between 0 and 0.1 tend to look best . <p> After putting ioLib out there a month or so back , I wanted to get back into the early experimental days of my Processing discovery for a while and create some purely visual sketches that were just simple generated visuals . With ioLib added to the mix of course , so I could manipulate and save out variations as I saw fit . <p> There are two I 've been playing with in particular . All images below are saved at wallpaper-friendly 2500+2500 , in case you have a mad urge to use them for anything . ( Ive been considering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of various sketches to make sharing this stuff easier , but I 'm still not convinced I need to pay another $25 for another pro account to make that happen . ) <p> The first , ShapeDistortion , takes a basic grid of primitive polygons and adds distortion , roundedness via curveVertex , and combines them with my typical generated palette secret sauce . As a bonus I built in some high-res texture support , though I only got as far as applying it to the background of the scene rather than on a shape-by-shape basis . <p> The second one , PaletteRays , shows the benefit of having controllable variables within a sketch . Using Perlin Noise and rotating around a central axis , the sketch plots thousands of semi-transparent circles that fade from one colour to the next , creating a fairly uniform blob effect . These are all from a single starting point and the different views are simply tweaked conditions while the sketch is running . It shows amazing amount of variety within the same basic framework ; the focal blur effect is particularly surprising . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next step will be tying in some external data sources and do something a little more interesting than straight up visual effects . <p> As hinted in the comments in my last post , I 've cleaned up my 3D elevation code and released it as a project , source and all . Go check out Elevation to grab Mac and Windows executables , or hit up GitHub to grab the source . <p> This project was a too-perfect alignment of things relevant to my interests . I got a chance to really stretch my legs with Processing , had an excuse to tinker with GitHub finally , spent some serious design time in Photoshop thinking through the site and app UI visuals , designed a high-res app icon , got to play with mapping and GPS software , and it all gave me the motivation to go out and pedal around this beautiful city to create my route data in the first place . Spending a month coding while racking up over 400km on the bike seems like a fairly healthy work/play balance . <p> And happily there 's plenty of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ XML formats to building a functional GUI . More on those soon . <p> So if you 've recently gotten into a visual programming language , and you also recently bought a bike , what 's the logical next step ? Merge the two pursuits of course . <p> There 's an app called RunKeeper for the iPhone 3G/3GS that uses the phones GPS to track your route / elevation / time as you 're out being active . If you upload your routes to the web site , you can get the data back out in a couple of XML formats . ( Googles KML kind of sucks , it turns out ; I 've been finding GPX files easier to use . RunKeepers web app exports both . ) <p> I 've started hacking up an app to plot the data in 3D space . Very early stages , but its working quite well so far . here 's a quick video : <p> Make sure to wait for the shift in plotting modes through the movie ; I 've built three so far : lines , points , and colour-coded points that indicate elevation ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ areas ) <p> You 're seeing 7 routes Ive ridden over the past couple of days . I 'm already seeing outlines of Vancouvers city features forming : the distinctive ducks head outline of Stanley Park , the south downtown seawall , the massive hill heading out to UBC , etc . <p> What 's obvious is that some of the elevation data , particularly around Stanley Park , is seriously whacked . I think the cliffs obscure the GPS signal or something , because it should be more or less sea level all the way around . ( In line view this is most obvious : its a series of jagged peaks and valleys , which strikes me as physically impossible ) . Hard to say whether its the app or the phones GPS to blame here , but my guess is the latter . <p> Next step : adding speed indicators , once I figure out how to work with ISO time stamps in Processing . ( And going out and biking more paths this weekend to start fleshing out the terrain a bit more . Nice way to stay motivated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ share my code for grabbing generative palettes from photos . So as basic as it is , here 's my trick . <p> First I throw a set of photos into the sketchs data folder , sequentially named 1. jpg through x.jpg ( though Ive since discovered Daniel Shiffmans excellent directory listing functions that would n't require me to touch the photo filenames ) . I choose a random image from this folder and load it into an off-screen buffer , then choose random pixels and load their colour values into a palette array . <p> That 's it . Stupidly simple , but all the interesting colour combos I 've posted on here in the past have been a direct result of this . Not every palette looks great , but if you 're using interesting photos as the source , 7 or 8 times out of ten you get something workable . <p> A bit of code documentation : since I use both portrait and landscape photos , I decided to constrain the area I grab pixels from to a top left square of 300x300 pixels . You can adjust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can control the number of colours you load in with the paletteCount variable , and the values ultimately end up in an array called palette , which you can use sequentially : <p> I spent the better part of this past week trying my hand at creating a decent-looking recursive tree , in between all the sweating this heat wave is causing . <p> Maybe its the heat but I think I 'm ready to throw in the towel . I got the recursion working reasonably well , but the branch curves look terrible , and most of the logical adjustments I wanted to make ended up in division by zero for some reason I could n't track down . <p> Like , a for loop starting from zero and incrementing i on each iteration ; I get that for the first iteration i = 0 so youd think this equation should work , right ? <p> variation = multiplier / ( i + 1 ) ; <p> But no such luck . " Division by zero " error . My actual code is more complicated of course , but that 's the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as I 'd have expected . <p> So I think for now its time to put this sketch to bed and move on to something else . Shame , I had some interesting things I wanted to do with the trees eventually . <p> I 'm back to dots again . This time Im stacking them in an orderly cube , and with the random palette some of them look pretty darn good . <p> I cant get this one exported into anything usable in a browser for some reason ; the applet that Processing creates just does n't  want to run . I suspected the photos I 'm using to generate the palette are to blame , but after hitting up the troubleshooting guide I appear to be doing everything right . The main symptom ( aside from not running ) is that the exported applet is only sized to 100+100 in the browser , which is a ) wrong and b ) strange . <p> Anyway , in lieu of something you can play with , here are some screen caps : <p> If for some reason you really really trust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Mac OS X , Windows , both around 2.5MB ) and play with them on your own system . No guarantees they wont hose your computer , but , they should n't . <p> ( Use the mouse to rotate the cube , press a or z to zoom in and out or the mousewheel , but that 's buggy and you can kind of drag it up and down to reposition , though that does n't  work well either . Hit the spacebar for a fresh palette . Oh , and s will save out a PNG of the current frame if you 're so inclined . ) <p> So after yesterdays Bezier celebration I thought I 'd try a more structured approach and see if I could n't capture some interesting movement . Reducing the number of objects down to 3600 and plotting them along a grid as a start , I got the end points and curves moving along Perlin-assisted paths in kind of a wind-blown look . <p> Still all in 3D space of course , so I saved out a quick capture with some viewpoint shifts and generated palettes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that not everything that 's generated is usable since I have to cycle through a few different palettes before I get something decent ) . <p> Okay , the generated palette idea was easier than I thought . Importing the photo into an off-screen buffer and grabbing some random pixel values makes for a fairly quick and easy way of generating an interesting palette . here 's the photo : <p> Ive been playing around with a variation of the radial sketch from my last post that plots a few thousand ellipses along a Perlin-randomized trajectory . I first spent a bit of time converting the ugly coordinate arrays to a cleaner object array , added a custom palette , and then added a bit more control over the view in the form of mouse-enabled 3D rotation and mousewheel zoom . <p> I 'm not done with this sketch yet , I 'm going to try generating a random palette from a photograph if I can get that working . For now here 's a dump of some of the more interesting stills : 
@@99593492 @3793492/ <p> Since 1994 , nearly all browsers have shipped with Times as the default font . Up until the introduction of the &lt;font&gt; tag , the only way it could be changed was if the user reset her own default . Most of the web was viewed in Times , and when a way to change that finally appeared we quickly embraced it and never looked back . <p> So why the continual shunning ? Its a good font . Designed in 1931 for The Times of London , it has become the de facto standard for digital imaging . While not as pixel-precise in its on-screen rendering as Georgia or Verdana , it still does a fine job . But still we ignore it , unless we specify it as a last resort for the lunatics viewing our site who even now do n't  have Georgia installed . <p> No more . Used in new and inspiring ways , Times can be beautiful and fresh , and a brand new old tool in our pathetically limited web type case . <p> First of all , let 's examine leading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the space between each line is the easiest way we can reinvigorate Times , and probably the most effective .

As a kid , there 's no future because life is all about living in the present . <p> Already we 've managed to drop the unstyled text look and move into something more typographically pleasing . What Ive taken for granted is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ study have determined that for maximum legibility , line lengths should be no more than 80 characters and no less than 40 characters . 65 is a good ideal to shoot for . The early web allowed no such control without a mish-mash of ugly &lt;p&gt; and &lt;br&gt; tags , but CSS let 's us get around that by limiting widths and setting margins . Doing so automatically casts off a bit of that early web stigma . <p> Body text may be re-sized of course , and picking anything other than 16px Times moves a further step away from the early-web look : <p> I never thought about it in as much detail .

It still feels like a browser war-era headline , and that has to go . So to mix some bad metaphors , let 's open up our arsenal and really give this some juice . See you on the other side . <p> Did you get that ? Each one is 32px Times New Roman , the same font @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be noted that px is a good unit for on-screen consistency , but its rather bad for accessibility . For our purposes right now , I 'm trying to match the common browser default for h1-sized text so its not as important , but more information on font sizing on the web is available , and indeed something you should read . <p> Before were done , let 's try playing with our CSS and applying some typography tricks to bring out the best from Times New Roman : <p> To a boy growing upin central British Columbia , hockey cards were a big thing .

( source ) <p> You get the idea . Now its up to you . Do n't  be afraid of Times embrace it , love it , and learn to use it well . The web will be better for it . <p> update : I 've added this PNG comparing Times to Georgia with and without Cleartype rendering . 30454 @qwx890454 <p> Well , I 'm sold . Thanks for the great examples and the refresher . I 'm one of those designers that has had a mental block on Times for quite a while now . Its just a font I never really conisder . And here I was thinking I was the only one . <p> Wonderful examples , Dave . Sometimes its very difficult to be open-minded and sensitive to the typographical needs of the web , but you seem the perfect soul to do it . You 're like a visionary or something . <p> Lead Rhyming with red Originally a strip of soft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between lines of type . Now meaning the vertical distance from the baseline of one line to the baseline of the next . Also called leading . <p> I read an article not too long ago from HumanFactors that said that while the rule of 80/40 was widely held to be " true " modern studies have found no such evidence that it must be so . Reading speeds and understanding appear to be the same despite varying line lengths and in the end it comes down to what the user prefers and not necessarily what 's best . <p> So the question comes up ; do we prefer the 80/40 just because it strikes some cord in us or because for 200+ years its been the standard in typography and were trained to feel comfortable with that length . <p> Actually , " letter-spacing " is the correct term for spacing between letters . Kerning refers to spatial relationships between specific pairs of letters and can differ from one typeface family to another . Some common problem pairs like To or Wa . Are n't  we such geeks ? <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hate it because of its ubiquity on the web ? <p> Laziness and inexperience both create poor visuals ; pages thrown together with no typographical consideration use Times , so you begin to associate it with bad or lazy design . Not to mention that an unstyled document is usually rendered in it . Both of those go a long way to explaining why it remains under-utilized . <p> I have to say that I am not at all sold . I find Times New Roman very annoying to read , at least as body text . I find that sans-serif fonts are much easier on my eyes for body text , and using the serif fonts for the headlines works quite nicely . Times does not render well in Windows 2000 on an lcd . The curves and angles are very pixelated . I cant even read the italicized body text ; it is far too annoying . The techniques you use are quite handy and I might try messing around with them at some point , but I will be keeping myself away from Times , thanks all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't  actually define the exact font on my site . I leave it up to the viewer to decide . I only define serif , sans , or monospace . <p> The use of color can also enliven Times ( or any font , for that matter . ) I think a lot of the perceived beauty of Georgia is that it is so often presented in colors other than black on white . The designers who employ Georgia tend to use a variety of fore- and background color combinations that add a lot of interest . Doing the same to Times would adds to its character , as well . <p> I do n't  actually define the exact font on my site . I leave it up to the viewer to decide . I only define serif , sans , or monospace . <p> But when was the last time you actually knew someone who defined these fonts in their browser ? For me , I think it was around 1996 , when that feature was first available . So in other words , you use Times , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Honestly , I still am not sure I like it , but youve certainly made it more acceptable in my mind . To me , though , the Times New Roman font at large sizes looks too pixelated . Look at the " R " or " Y " in your ( font : 100 32px Times New Roman ; letter-spacing : 0.1em ; text-transform : uppercase ; ) example . Does n't  the " slant " look kind of jagged ? That 's just the nature of the font , I know , but I do n't  like that so much . But I must say , on the smaller font sizes , you made it look appealing , and I maight try to use it myself someday . <p> Thats success on your part- taking designers from " Times ? Ill never use that nasty font ! " to " Yeah , with a little stylin , Times might be the right font for the job ! " . Thanks ! <p> Since I got namechecked , I 'll pop in to say that the default meyerweb theme , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ styled Times : <p> font : 100% " Times New Roman " , Times , TimesNR , serif ; <p> Personally , I think it works well with the design into which it was placed , perhaps because I started with Times and designed around it ( to the extent that I can be said to design at all ) . But you 've prompted me to play around with some variations on that theme , maybe spreading stuff out just a bit , to see if I like it any better . <p> As for Web typography in general , I complained about size a while back . I 'd love to see you tackle some of those issues , Dave , in the same lucid and compelling manner you did here . <p> Everytime I look at a Times New Roman typeface especially when its been set to a smaller size on my Windows 2000 test machinewhich has been set to smooth edges of fonts as much as possibleI want to cringe . And italicized ? Oof . So this is the look that everyone complains about . <p> But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will have a ClearType or Quartz enabled environment , and those that do n't  can stop calling us " Mr. Jaggy. " as in Jagged , not Jaguar <p> I 've appended a PNG to this post comparing Times New Roman to Georgia on Firebird/XP rows 1 and 3 are Times , rows 2 and 4 are Georgia . No anti-aliasing on the left , ClearType on the right . They run from 10px to 14px . <p> I 'm finding that non-anti-aliased Georgia looks almost as bad as Times at 10px , is that just me ? I 'd say 11px is the sweet spot for both of them where they start becoming more easily readable . <p> Like I said , Times was n't designed specifically for on-screen use , but seeing it next to a font that was shows that it sure does a hell of a job , considering . <p> Daves been reminiscing about Music School or something Every Good Boy Deserves Fudge ! That 's an acronym for the lines on the treble clef ( A.K.A. G-clef ) ! HA ! That 's great . Thanks for the comparison . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on either font , anti-alias or not , looks kind of lacking . <p> From what I learnt back at University , Serif fonts are supposed to be easier to read than Sans-Serif cause of the little hooks and spikes which allows the eyes to glide from one letter to the next . I wonder is it because its non-accurate pixel placement on screen that makes it worse than it is on print . <p> The 80/40 rule . I think the best way is to have the main content resize with the window so that the user can adjust the width of the browser window to read a long text page comfortably . I know people who adjust columns to something not to my personal liking at all , so tastes must differ . Using ems as column width can give a good starting point at page load . <p> you have to ask yourself then , do you hate it because of its ubiquity on the web ? <p> partially sohowever , ive been seeing verdana for a few years now as well , and it does n't  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ qualify . i 'm not a typeface specialist , i just know what i like when i see ittheres one incarnation of Times that brings me nothing but good feelinga page printed using LaTeX . The reason is because when i first was in college , this was the only real way to print a page that looked decent . I made sure I mastered LaTeX just so my reports looked better than the other underclassment who would use the default printer font . For that , i guess , it holds a place in my heart . However i do submit that the spacing of a " default " LaTeX document is different than the first documents i read in something like MS wordpad . It looked less elegant . <p> Having said that , i 'm nearly sure the reasons are psychological and not visualbut then againwhat is n't ? : ) <p> This is a choice *I* made . It is not necessarily the right choice in all situations . But when my blind friends tell me that somethings easier for them , hey , I listen and try to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always looked upon Times New Roman as the " ugly font " when its used in its navive format on the wed i ushally see it as a mark of bad design . However this guide has really changed my opinions on the font . I may well intergrate some of you tips into a futures design . Inspirational stuff . <p> I have had this article bookmarked for a while now because I knew it would come in handy . And it did - I have just converted an intranet site from a graphics-based site ( images used for breakout quotes from articlesetc. ) to a CSS driven site , and TNR fitted the bill for the breakout quotes . Normally I would never consider it but after reading this I thought " hmm , this may look quite good " - and it does .

@@99593493 @3793493/ <p> here 's the kicker its DHTML . No Flash or Java is involved , its all being pulled from the server real-time , and the interactive controls ( Zoom and Pan both , try click + dragging the map ) are something you 'd have to be crazy to implement on dynamic data , but there it is anyway thanks to XMLHttpRequest . Google Suggest was one of the first uses of the method to cross my radar that actually did something with the technology beyond displaying test data , but Map.Search launched in October of 2004 ( according to the release notes ) and it blows Suggest out of the water . <p> From the layered data ( GIF labels and JPG photography ) to the staggered load as the zoom increases ( where the already-loaded map resizes and interpolates to provide a rough , blurry outline of the new area as additional data loads , or vice-versa when zooming out ) , the almost-seamless interactivity is an impressive demonstration of what 's possible with XMLHttpRequest and clever , cross-browser tested scripting . <p> Various implementation quirks highlight some limitations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work works inconsistently in non-Mozilla browsers ( like Safari or IE ) , and none of the individual map stages are directly linkable ( the developers actually found a way around this ) . I have to take a screenshot to show you where I found CERN instead of linking it directly . <p> ( Yep , that 's an overhead view of the Swiss portion of CERN that I found in Map.Search . If I aligned my maps right , the red arc indicates a portion of the LEP Large Electron Positron collidor . Hint : Its in Gen+ve Geneva , Meyrin to be precise ) <p> But what of the technology itself ? If you 've been following the development , you 'll know that it got started as an Internet Explorer extension . Everyone else must have seen merit in a method of loading bits and pieces of new data from the server without refreshing an entire document , a method that was n't frames/iframes anyway , and now Mozilla and Safari both support it and Operas getting on board in a hurry . You can start playing with it today @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usage . <p> Its not a part of any approved standard though , so therein lies the rub . At the moment , the technology is just a proprietary extension , though movement is underway to make it more " official " : The WHAT WG has incorporated it into their Web Applications Draft . This lack of official blessing may limit its use in some peoples minds , but at this point its essentially a de facto standard anyway . Nothing else like it exists , so as far as Im concerned it falls into that fuzzy realm where the official specs need to catch up with the technology . <p> Anyway , particularly nice is the fact that with or without the DHTML that makes it go , Map.Search continues to function . Its a more limited **34;908;TOOLONG kind of functionality , but that 's a totally legitimate degradation . <p> Its this kind of low-impact scripting that 's going to take off this year , I agree with Simon on that count . The name of the game is script that enhances HTML functionality , rather than provides core @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HTML is a fine building block to begin with , and responsible DOM scripting is going to take it to new levels . <p> Update:Bernhard Seefeld , one of the developers of Map.Search , and various commenters have mentioned that XMLHttpRequest is actually only being used for ads . The mapping functionality itself is straight DHTML and image loading , so it works in even **26;944;TOOLONG browsers . <p> Still , it does n't make the site any less impressive , and it is a good example of the sort of thing one might use XMLHttpRequest for . If anything , I 'm glad to discover there are other ways to pull off this kind of functionality having a choice never hurts . <p> &gt; at this point its essentially a de facto standard anyway . Nothing else like it exists , so as far as Im concerned it falls into that fuzzy realm where the official specs need to catch up with the technology . <p> Why does everybody ignore DOM 3 Load and Save ?

I have been using it , basically , with IE since about 2000 I think on a project I did for the state of West Virginias Adult Literacy programs . They have large complicated forms that have alot of background processing and database interaction going on . Using the XMLHttpRequest object - though at the time its invocation was a bit different - I was able to make the form computations based on dynamic data from the database possible - and thus vastly improve the user experience . <p> Back when I first discovered the technique though you had to declare an xml object in your html like so : &lt;xml id= " appXMLObject " async= " false " /&gt; <p> As you can see from the function name it was referenced as a dataisland then . Anyway , I was , and am still , very happy to see it becoming more and more usable across browsers - even though the technique has changed . <p> Yup , the XMLHttpRequest objects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ server-side programming ( ASP , ASP.NET ) for a long time now and have been available in modern browsers for quite a while . <p> I remember a few years ago I helped somebody develop a form which used the XMLHttpRequest object to submit the form when you clicked the submit button , then used the DOM to display the result of the submissionall the while the page on in the browser was still there . <p> If you use GMail , it is largely driven by this type of interaction . Google Suggest was probably the biggest public release of such a feature , which I am much more impressed with than an interactive map . Just the shear fact that no matter what letter you type , you will have the top 10 Google results sitting in a scrollable DIV just beneath the textbox in an instant that is quite impressive ! <p> Are you aware of any good resources for learning " responsible " JavaScript ? Esp . for those of us ( ahem ) who have never had particularly well-developed JS skills , so are not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot to edit metadata on an image . You need to have a user account to really experience it but theyve put it to good use . As with the other examples , it means that part of a page can be updated without the need for reloading the entire page , making the system much faster . <p> * WinXP , FF 1.0 * text size bumped up a notch ( high resolution combined with old eyeballs ) * it looks like longer comments get cut offbut if I highlight towards the end and keep " pulling " then I can see the rest , as if there ought to be a scrollbar . <p> OK lots more code , but maybe I 'm daft , but the xmlhttprequest stuff only seems to be used for ad switching . All the images are obtained from a server-side process . <p> Getting xml/html is fine for partial rewrites , but the zooming could all be done using js code . And then have a server-side request for the right image , using coordinates . Which is what I think the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go away and read it more thoroughly or this is n't using XMLHttpRequest to do the zooming . <p> As Bernhard says , the core functionality is n't actually XMLHttpRequest . I was following Simons comments and had n't  bothered sifting through the source . <p> Still , it does n't  make the site any less impressive , and it IS a good example of the sort of thing one might use XMLHttpRequest for . If anything , I 'm happy to discover there are other ways to pull off this kind of functionality having a choice never hurts . <p> That map application was pretty cool . I think it would have been possible to do it without , you click the map and the server generates a new image . Maybe I will learn to use XMLHttpRequest some day when I get time to spear . <p> Dave did n't  note this , but at Navarik , a company he did some work with much of the past year , we 've been using XMLHttpRequest to load dynamic sections of very complex pages in web-based applications for over a year now . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these apps , and using XMLHttpRequest helps make them behave in more desktop-like ways , since otherwise those monster-size pages would take forever to do full refreshes on : <p> I think the rising popularity of the XMLHttpRequest interface might become the killer reason for coding web pages in XHTML . If all web pages are XML documents , then they can all be easily retrieved via the XMLHttpRequest interface , opening up new possibilities in enhancing the experience of users of the web . <p> Actually you could argue that the map uses a kind of XMLHTTP , since it sends requests back to the server for the data ( = the images ) , even though it uses the ancient someImgEl.src technique instead of modern XMLHTTP . <p> I could n't resist writing a little piece about this map , XMLHTTP , and what it all means .

For the sake of having interesting new things on this site , here are a few notes from my own battle in the trenches : the Hack Hotbot contest . Hopefully theyll be of some use to anyone joining me in this raving masochism . <p> Ugly code When you invite people over to your home for dinner , its considered rude for them to speak up about your cleaning habits . However , when you invite someone into your home , you usually spend a few minutes frantically cleaning to make it presentable . <p> I 'm going to be a bit rude here , pardon my manners HotWired yep , Hotbot is a mess . It was lauded for converting to a CSS layout a few months back , but I wonder how many people have had their hands in there since . You can almost see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ draw a sketch of the main structural elements , to give you an idea of which containers you can hack for various effect . <p> Keep in mind that anything you do can only be done to the style sheet . There is no way to modify the HTML source , so consider it set in stone . <p> Hardcoded pixel values in tables I said it was a mess , right ? There are a few different spots where the tables are given set widths . I 'm not against tables for tabular data , but these particular tables seem unnecessary . Not only that , but they are 600 pixel plus , so it limits the design side of things to pretty much one configuration : search box on top , search results/filters right below . <p> I suspect the layouts of the new skins will be quite similar to each other . There is n't much room to maneuver here , so variation will be more likely in the colour scheme , fonts , and backgroundimages . <p> Extra style sheet After all your hard work , there 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few elements in the original style sheet . This might not be a problem , except that some rules are marked ! important exactly the hack I had in mind to override them . <p> The main element I 've clashed with so far has been the logo but in the end I won . A bit of lateral thinking says , okay , its relatively positioned top and left , but that does n't  mean it has to stay there . Top and Left positions are n't  the only thing determining where it sits on the page . Thanks to some crafty hacking of the margins and a few strategic ! important placements , I 've managed to move it to where I need it . <p> Shifting elements So when you first load the page , you get an announcement table telling you about the Hack contest , which you can close . Which means that the search bar below will shift in place once you 've closed it . Which means any background image you 've placed to contain the two which relies on pixel values gets bunged up . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closed . <p> Once you close it , it does n't  look like you can get it back without flushing your cookies . So I 'd recommend Viewing source and saving a copy of the HTML to your hard drive to work from , to make sure you 're seeing the announcement window . Heck , I 'd recommend that regardless , it saves time with all the FTPing back and forth . <p> Lack of containers One thing I 've had to face is that there are n't  many elements TO hack . Youve got a few standalones sitting in the body , but nothing containing them . Which may or may not be a problem , depending on your design ideas . It certainly was with my own . <p> here 's a $50 tip that may or may not have occured to you : with CSS , its possible to override most every element . Including the &lt;form&gt; element . You can even apply background images to it . wink wink nudge nudge . <p> For all my complaining , I have to give credit to the guys at HotWired this was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jumped at . It takes guts to open up your source to the world , bugs and all . <p> I have to wonder about the entries though . I 'm sure I will be blown away by what is accomplished with creative CSS and some nonlinear thinking , but the bar seems rather high for entry to this . Not only do you have to be a code jockey , capable of making sense of the standardssoup , but you have to be a great designer to put it all together into something attractive . What we saw recently with the WThRemix contest was that the CSS as structure crowd were gungho to throw their hat in the ring , but the CSS as beauty crowd shied away . <p> This contest is for people who are both . How many of those are there , I wonder . I hope they put up a big page of entries once the contest is over , I 'd love to browse and see if I 'm totally out to lunch here or if my theories hold up . 
@@99593495 @3793495/ <p> While the points against it have been made , you should not feel bad for signing it . Why ? Because your hearts were in the right place , God bless you all . <p> The resulting dialogue has come up with this : Freedom Scientific , the creators of JAWS , offer a completely free demo version of the product that lasts for 40 minutes before requiring a system reboot . Wisdom of the moment says you have no need for a free or mostly so developers edition because this demo version exists . Its good enough for you . ( The question is begged : since Freedom Scientific makes zero profit either way , the effective difference is what ? One way is legitimate , the other is not . Let 's not get too tangled up in this , because both arguments have holes . ) <p> Were all on the same side , and quibbles notwithstanding , we want the same thing . So in my journey of discovery over this past week , I continued re-phrasing the same question until I got an answer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what I needed to read , and I commend you all to give it your well-deserved attention . <p> Points made : <p> JAWS is a specialized application ; if you do not commit to a solid week of running it without a monitor to fall-back on you cant expect to use it to test effectively . So even using the demo version is n't going to get you very far . <p> There are other screenreaders on the market ; you shouldnt be catering to software , although it cant hurt to later run your work by someone who actually has a screenreader . <p> If you code to WCAG , you are creating accessible sites , software quirks aside . <p> Read Kynns tutorial and be aware of the issues . But instead of spending a bit of time fooling around with an application you have little hope of being able to use properly , instead spend that time familiarizing yourself with WCAG , and brush up with the plethora of information that 's available for free already . <p> " There are other screenreaders on the market If you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ software quirks aside . " <p> Come on . Would you really consider coding to the HTML and CSS specifications as an adequate substitute for testing in Internet Explorer ? Does it matter that there are other visual browsers on the market ? <p> " there is a need for some authoritive documentation from freedomscientific about JAWS behaviour " <p> Hrmph I feel slightly duped . I signed that pettition under the impression that there was nothing available to developers aside from the behemoth $895 ( or whatever ) JAWS product . I did n't  realize there was a " 40 minute then you got ta reboot " free testing product . That seems more than fair for a software company to do , and pretty adequate to do a simple accessability test . If you code to the WACG before firing up the 40 minute JAWS " demo " , then those 40 minutes should be 40 minutes of sheer confirmation that you did it right- and if you missed something , fix it and reboot . Its a small inconvinience , but its adequate . Maybe a better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for cheap- like $200 - just a thought . <p> the problem i have with the demo solution is that it moves in the gray area of legality , if i 'm not mistaken . the demo is provided as an evaluation of the product in the light of a possible purchase . consciously using the demo " instead " of the full product goes against the idea of demo ( and probably some clause in the demos EULA as well ) <p> The EULA is probably about 100 pages , and nobodys ever read it , but I 'm sure it involves not using the product consistently for testing purposes . <p> This is why , though I understand those who think this is all the company should do , the demo is not a solution to the problem . It is a questionable hack at best . <p> Dave , its good that this has given you food for thought , but I am disturbed that you are so willing to sell yourself and all web developers short - of course , we will never be able to know what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but I reject the argument that we are making things worse by trying to test our sites with a reader . Give us all a little more credit . <p> We use a product called InFocus to determine 508 compatibility . It allegedly reads screens the way JAWS does but produces text output , so its not necessary to run JAWS itself . In addition , it addresses a host of other 508 compatibility and usability issues , and will change HTML automatically ( if so directed ) which can save a lot of time fixing code , too , assuming your HTML is not the result of ASP , Cold Fusion , or some other HTML generator . <p> Ive been in contact with JAWS ( and several other screenreader/talking browser ) companies over the past couple of years and I 've found many to be very unhelpful which I personally find rather disconcerting . <p> I too worry about the legality of using what is essentially trial software constantly , I 'm sure Macromedia and Adobe would have something to say about it if I downloaded their 30 day evals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's why I have licensed copies of Macromedia and Adobe software . <p> They are essential to what I do , and the cost of the software I use and its updates ( moving from photoshop 7 to CS and so on ) make up a substansial part of my companies budget for software each year . However a screen-reader simply does n't  fall into this essential bracket , especially as many clients functional specs only cover testing on the latest crop of browsers that are all available freely over the internet . <p> I do n't  beleive that we designers as a group should be building essentially buggy code to fit the quirks of screen-readers , but I would at least like to be able to test the work I do out in one instead of relying on bobby , watchfire , WAI and lynx as benchmarks for testing a sites compliance to AAA standards and section 508 . <p> What annoys me about this whole affair is the seeming distain most of the companies that produce accessibility software have for the design community and further more it *really* @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ essence of making more online media accessible they simply brush your comments to one side and then refer you to the sales department . <p> When you come to the bottom line the fact is that many companies simply can not warrant the expense of buying several screen-readers to test their products on while screen-readers remain so expensive , it simply does n't  make financial sense to buy software that wo n't pay for itself . End of story from our perspective but from the screen-reader companies perspective , surely it would make sense to cater for the design community so they can get valuable feedback on how they could improve their software ( which is generally buggy and ill-thought-out ) from a community of people who ( on the whole ) are simply striving to do the best job possible ? <p> Now as with many firms we have to justify our purchases to our accountants , and paying -50 for a piece of limited demonstration software would raise eyebrows in almost every accountants office . 30455 @qwx890455 30451 @qwx890451 <p> You are reading " JAWS Petition : Mea Culpa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to the It appears something went wrong and we 're missing an image and style , sorry about the mess . collection .

@@99593496 @3793496/ <p> Seems like Im more inclined to post screenshots of work-in-progress on Dribbble these days , so you can see a few of my current experiments over there . My latest project is remixing older sketches to layer different objects and apply blur and noise filter effects . <p> Blur is relatively simple , Processing has a built-in blur() function that gets the job done . Its slow , and applying multiple blurs per frame really slows down rendering , but its way easier to work with than the GLGraphics library . Ill probably need to dive into the latter eventually , but for now , I 'm happy to let Processing do the heavy lifting here . <p> Noise was simple too , although it took a few attempts to crack . I initially thought I could just use set to drop an array of black pixels on top of the scene , using a random alpha value for the opacity . Except set does n't  appear to like alpha values , as the render would start correctly but then layer up to full black over a few frames @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once , but there would be multiple frames of noise being applied . I do n't  quite understand that one , but it was enough to convince me to try it another way . <p> Instead what I 'm doing is grabbing the current colour value and using lerpColor to select a random point between it and full black . The amount variable controls how far from the original colour it will deviate , values between 0 and 0.1 tend to look best . <p> Short of the previous manually-created gallery , I 've been looking for an easy way of sharing renders from some of the sketches I 've been working on . Flickr did n't  quite cut it , but I think Dropbox has potential . So you 'll see a new link in the sidebar to a Dropbox gallery of High Res Renders that I 'll update periodically . Special bonus : an early preview of the Ribbons sketch I have in the works right now . <p> After putting ioLib out there a month or so back , I wanted to get back into the early experimental days of my Processing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that were just simple generated visuals . With ioLib added to the mix of course , so I could manipulate and save out variations as I saw fit . <p> There are two I 've been playing with in particular . All images below are saved at wallpaper-friendly 2500+2500 , in case you have a mad urge to use them for anything . ( Ive been considering creating a new Flickr account to dump the high-res output of various sketches to make sharing this stuff easier , but I 'm still not convinced I need to pay another $25 for another pro account to make that happen . ) <p> The first , ShapeDistortion , takes a basic grid of primitive polygons and adds distortion , roundedness via curveVertex , and combines them with my typical generated palette secret sauce . As a bonus I built in some high-res texture support , though I only got as far as applying it to the background of the scene rather than on a shape-by-shape basis . <p> The second one , PaletteRays , shows the benefit of having controllable variables within a sketch . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sketch plots thousands of semi-transparent circles that fade from one colour to the next , creating a fairly uniform blob effect . These are all from a single starting point and the different views are simply tweaked conditions while the sketch is running . It shows amazing amount of variety within the same basic framework ; the focal blur effect is particularly surprising . <p> Now these pieces are in place , I suspect the next step will be tying in some external data sources and do something a little more interesting than straight up visual effects . <p> Its been more an issue of time restraints than lack of motivation that has kept me away from this blog over the past few months . Side projects here , trip around the world there , etc. etc . <p> To get back into my Processing exploration , I decided to formalize some of my most commonly-used functions into a single staring-point library/framework that I could build new sketches off of . Called ioLib , I 've pushed it up to my ongoing gitHub repository of various sketches for anyones use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far as frameworks go I 'd imagine there 's still a lot of work to be done toward making it self-contained , so I doubt itll be broadly applicable to people other than me . Maybe over time itll grow into something a bit more formal . <p> I tried to focus on some basic interactivity and output functions , stuff I find myself using over and over again . Straight from the README , this is what 's in it so far : <h> Bitmap and Vector Output <p> pressing s saves a screencap as PNG <p> pressing p saves a screencap as PDF <p> 3D mode is a bit quirky ; the raw triangles are saved , even for 2D shapes . The background colour does n't  save either . <h> 2D / 3D Toggle <p> So far everything works with both 2D and 3D renderers , switching is a simple matter of adjusting the sceneDimensions variable in the user-configurable settings . <h> Palette Generation from Random Images <p> Any images ( PNG , JPG or GIF ) dropped into data/paletteSource will be used as input for the random palette generation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how large the palette will be . <p> A geography issue Ive been struggling with over the past little while is correcting my assumptions about how latitude / longitude coordinates work . When I originally built Elevation I decided to take a shortcut and ignore Earth curvature , treating my GPS points as a Cartesian grid . <p> And it worked , sort of . It gave me land forms that come close to representing the actual terrain . In hindsight its pretty obvious how distorted they were , but for the first few iterations of the program they were good enough . <p> I 've now started looking into representing paths with more accuracy . At the moment Elevations speed scale is totally relative to the data , but I 'd like to peg actual km/h values to it . I 'd also like to indicate the scale of the map with sliding meter/kilometer markers that adjust based on zoom level . As I started going down this road I quickly realized the math needed a closer look . <p> Without a clue where to begin , I turned to Wikipedia and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offer a clue about converting my GPS coordinates into a proper grid . Long story short , what I needed was a map projection system . <p> Mercator is probably the most familiar projection out there , and its the same one Google , Yahoo , Microsoft etc. use for their online mapping services . While it seriously distorts extreme high and low latitudes ( Greenland is n't really the same size as Africa , after all ) , it has the advantage of treating smaller local areas more uniformly . Mercator wont work at the North Pole or in the Antarctic , but at a regional level like city or state/province its a fairly uniform distortion so the maps just look right ; since Elevation is intended for those smaller areas , that 's perfect for my needs . <p> So , how does one go about converting GPS lat/long coordinates to actual meters ? That 's where the math comes in , and Wikipedia handily lists a few formulas for it . Processing does n't  have sinh , cosh , or sec functions , so only the first two functions for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ x = ++ - ++o y = 0.5 * ln * ( ( 1 + sin(-) ) / ( 1 - sin(-) ) ) <p> The x value basically ends up being your raw longitude coordinate , though its handy to offset it from the central x axis of your map . The y value requires a bit more heavy lifting . In Processing , the above functions end up looking something like this : <p> While Wikipedia does n't  explicitly say anything about radians , I found it necessary to convert y before the math would work in Processing , then convert the result back to degrees . <p> The resulting values still do n't  represent real units on the surface of the globe ; to get that you have to multiply each by the degree length , a variable value that corresponds to the surface distance between a single degree change in latitude . At the equator there are approximately 111km between degrees , but this number shrinks the closer you get to the poles . <p> Solving this problem is something I 'm currently working on . An @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appears to be almost exactly 1.6 times less than the value at the equator , which looked for all the world like a flubbed imperial/metric conversion . If I were to start with the equator distance and divide by 1.6 : <p> x = ( adjustedPhi * 111319.9 ) / 1.6 ; y = ( lambda * 111319.9 ) / 1.6 ; <p> I would get values that look fairly darn close to accurate in Vancouver . I thought that had solved it , but I now suspect the math at different latitudes is still very much wrong . Ill update this post once I know more . <p> Update : Thanks Microsoft , for publishing this piece on MSDN about how your Bing Maps tile system works . This bit in particular seems like it contains what I 'm looking for : <p> The ground resolution indicates the distance on the ground that 's represented by a single pixel in the map . For example , at a ground resolution of 10 meters/pixel , each pixel represents a ground distance of 10 meters . The ground resolution varies depending on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's measured . Using an earth radius of 6378137 meters , the ground resolution ( in meters per pixel ) can be calculated as : <p> The map scale indicates the ratio between map distance and ground distance , when measured in the same units . For instance , at a map scale of 1 : 100,000 , each inch on the map represents a ground distance of 100,000 inches . Like the ground resolution , the map scale varies with the level of detail and the latitude of measurement . It can be calculated from the ground resolution as follows , given the screen resolution in dots per inch , typically 96 dpi : <p> I 've known for a while now that Processing and Elevation in particular is a bit of a CPU hog , as evidenced by the hum of the CPU fan frantically spinning every time I run a sketch . I had a vague idea of what the culprit might be , so its an issue I 've meant to look into . <p> Let 's back up about 13 years for a second ; in the mid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teeth on programming in Basic , a popular beginners languages at the time . I was building fairly simple GUIs for applications and games , but even those were taxing what little processor speed I had available . Back then I stumbled across what I 'd imagine to be a fairly core tenet of any sort of programming that involves drawing to the screen : do n't  , if you can help it . <p> When you 're just starting out , you do n't  really consider the work involved in throwing thousands of pixels at the screen every iteration , so you default to simply redrawing the screen during every cycle of your application loop . In the 90 's this was significantly more of a problem since the CPU just could n't keep up , and we had to learn to selectively redraw only when it was necessary . These days the processor speed is less of a barrier , so the temptation is there to use the extra power we have available . This is fine for learning , but when you 're producing something people are going to use , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the CPUs time it actually needs . <p> By the very nature of the draw loop , Processing is n't really set up for optimization . The default mode is simply to draw , and redraw , and keep doing it over and over again . When you can take it for granted that the screen will be wiped every cycle , you do n't  necessarily have to think about things like cleaning up old pixels before placing new ones . Its convenient , but it comes at a price . Currently an instance of Elevation will run at something like 99% of CPU time , all the time , until its closed . This is a problem . <p> So last night I started digging into the problem to see if I could n't knock that down a little . The updated code is only available from the GitHub repo so far , but itll likely be rolled into the next version of the app . <p> I started by adding a global refresh variable that gets set to false , and then wrapped most of the draw loop contents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been switched to true . Then just before the loop closes , I make sure to reset it back to false so the next loop wont also redraw . <p> The question now becomes , when is it appropriate to set refresh to true ? That 's something I 'm still working through ; if I simply switch it back on in response to keyboard and mouse event handlers , that 's a start ; but in Elevation I also have on-screen form controls that glow on hover , and switch images between when they 're selected and when they 're not . I now have to rework some of the assumptions those controls were making about the draw loop and code them to be a bit smarter about when they actually need to redraw . <p> Still , just these basic steps were a great start . Manipulating the scene with the mouse and zooming in and out will still tax the CPU , but as soon as you take your hands off the controls usage drops down from 99% to a more reasonable 4% or 5% . Thats progress . <p> As hinted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up my 3D elevation code and released it as a project , source and all . Go check out Elevation to grab Mac and Windows executables , or hit up GitHub to grab the source . <p> This project was a too-perfect alignment of things relevant to my interests . I got a chance to really stretch my legs with Processing , had an excuse to tinker with GitHub finally , spent some serious design time in Photoshop thinking through the site and app UI visuals , designed a high-res app icon , got to play with mapping and GPS software , and it all gave me the motivation to go out and pedal around this beautiful city to create my route data in the first place . Spending a month coding while racking up over 400km on the bike seems like a fairly healthy work/play balance . <p> And happily there 's plenty of fodder in here for future posts , from parsing differing XML formats to building a functional GUI . More on those soon . <p> So if you 've recently gotten into a visual programming language , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next step ? Merge the two pursuits of course . <p> There 's an app called RunKeeper for the iPhone 3G/3GS that uses the phones GPS to track your route / elevation / time as you 're out being active . If you upload your routes to the web site , you can get the data back out in a couple of XML formats . ( Googles KML kind of sucks , it turns out ; I 've been finding GPX files easier to use . RunKeepers web app exports both . ) <p> I 've started hacking up an app to plot the data in 3D space . Very early stages , but its working quite well so far . here 's a quick video : <p> Make sure to wait for the shift in plotting modes through the movie ; I 've built three so far : lines , points , and colour-coded points that indicate elevation ( blue in the low areas , red in the high areas ) <p> You 're seeing 7 routes Ive ridden over the past couple of days . I 'm already seeing outlines of Vancouvers city features forming : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ south downtown seawall , the massive hill heading out to UBC , etc . <p> What 's obvious is that some of the elevation data , particularly around Stanley Park , is seriously whacked . I think the cliffs obscure the GPS signal or something , because it should be more or less sea level all the way around . ( In line view this is most obvious : its a series of jagged peaks and valleys , which strikes me as physically impossible ) . Hard to say whether its the app or the phones GPS to blame here , but my guess is the latter . <p> Next step : adding speed indicators , once I figure out how to work with ISO time stamps in Processing . ( And going out and biking more paths this weekend to start fleshing out the terrain a bit more . Nice way to stay motivated . ) <p> I 've had a few requests now to share my code for grabbing generative palettes from photos . So as basic as it is , here 's my trick . <p> First I throw a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ named 1. jpg through x.jpg ( though Ive since discovered Daniel Shiffmans excellent directory listing functions that would n't require me to touch the photo filenames ) . I choose a random image from this folder and load it into an off-screen buffer , then choose random pixels and load their colour values into a palette array . <p> That 's it . Stupidly simple , but all the interesting colour combos I 've posted on here in the past have been a direct result of this . Not every palette looks great , but if you 're using interesting photos as the source , 7 or 8 times out of ten you get something workable . <p> A bit of code documentation : since I use both portrait and landscape photos , I decided to constrain the area I grab pixels from to a top left square of 300x300 pixels . You can adjust those values to suit , if needed . <p> You can control the number of colours you load in with the paletteCount variable , and the values ultimately end up in an array called palette , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bit of a setback in my latest project . I jumped the gun and installed a shiny new copy of Snow Leopard on one of my computers , the main one I 've been using for all my Processing tinkering . I knew in advance which apps would be affected , but did n't  really think of the implications of the new Quicktime X update . <p> Turns out the QTJava library that sites between Processing and the Quicktime codecs that allow it to output video has been deprecated as of Quicktime X. Last night I did my first test render and it looked great ; today I do n't  have the ability to output . mov files anymore . So , that 's fun . <p> I 've got a second computer with plain old Leopard on it that I can still render from , but I wish I 'd taken advantage of that second of hesitation when I saw the " install Quicktime 7 ? checkbox as I upgraded this morning . There 's probably a way to get it back , I 'll update if I find out what it is . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Snow Leopard install DVD there 's a folder called " Optional Installs " ; run the package in there and select Quicktime 7 from the list . <p> Except that does n't  seem to work . Even with Quicktime 7 I cant seem to save out a movie file . Drat. 
@@99593497 @3793497/ <p> Point : there are people who will steal Zen Garden designs no matter what we do . <p> Point : slapping a restrictive license on the CSS files is completely against what the Zen Garden is trying to accomplish . <p> Point : cheap knock-offs are not a professional threat to the original designers . <p> Point : those who need to use other peoples CSS are still learning , or they 're lazy . If its the former , their use is an intermediate step ; when they feel comfortable enough to move beyond someone elses design , there 's no question they will . If its the latter , the site they 're applying the design to wont be around for long anyway . <p> So there you go . Creative Commons is back ( although it never technically went away , since I had n't  got around to modifying the . css files yet ) , and all new submissions will continue to be open . <p> I realized the value of the Zen Garden is much more than I originally intended : not only do we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but we also have a central repository of tested CSS designs that have solved browser compatibility issues and layout problems . Little Boxes , Blue Robot , and Glish are all still useful and relevant , but were moving beyond duplicating table-based layouts . <p> Creative Commons remains a double-edged sword . Individual use has never really bothered me ( there have been plenty of people basing sites/weblogs on the . css files ) , but the recent example moved into a whole new territory I was n't prepared to deal with , namely re-distribution . <p> I worry all this will inhibit some submitters . Design is not software : there is no such thing as an open source mentality . Some share more freely than others , but most are very firmly negative about their work being used elsewhere . The quality of work being submitted keeps going up despite it all ; maybe I neednt worry . <p> That 's a really good news , Dave . Thanks a lot for keeping the CC , and thanks a lot for Zen Garden . Its been a huge source @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every jacka$$ who steals the CSS , there will be a thousand others who will get inspired and learn the CSS . <p> For me , the impact of Zen Garden has been beyond just the web . I have started using layouts similar to some of the designs for my technical presentations . For my powerpoint talks , I use slide layout similar to " Not so minimal " and for posters , I use layout similar to " Zunflower " . <p> Hi All , Ive gone through most of the entries in this thread and the earlier , originating thread and am naively confused . I 'm a programmer and not a designer and clearly the cultural trappings of the two activities have some serious differences . <p> This provocateur behaved as a software programmer / engineer would : reuse what 's already been done if at all possible . This attitude arises from deadline and scheduling pressures and produce the notion of code sharing when there are no legal restrictions . Were one engineer to tell another that the code used belonged to him , the other engineer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sharing , teaches through sharing and develops through sharing . The notion of one person creating something and not allowing anyone else to use the code is in fact the GPLs reason for being : to prevent this scenario . <p> So I now find myself in a very confusing situation where you , designers as a group , have adopted a licensing scheme that to me looks like the GPL , yet your intent is not to promote sharing but to treat it in some way alien to me yet wholly consistant and appropriate for you . <p> Why do you see use of your CSS templates as stealing ? I am very sincere in this question since I do n't  understand your concept of ownership and sharing . I do understand the images concern so I guess I have a difficult time seeing CSS coding in the same category as images such as jpeg , gif , etc . <p> I agree strongly with the idea of dating the submissions , although since the HTML file does n't  change , the date would need to be embedded in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would like to add that the CSS Zen Garden has been a wonderful inspiration to me . Ive been fooling around with web design for a couple of years , using XHTML and CSS right from the outset . As a result , I should not be shackled to the grid-based layouts that using tables often creates , should I ? Unfortunately , my inexperience with design has meant that everything I have done thus far has been rather ordinary-looking and very much inside the box . <p> After browsing the work of The Garden , I have come to understand the power of the tools I already possessed . By learning a little bit of Photoshop and looking at the nature around me , I have cut some of my bonds . <p> Oddly enough , it is not so much the clever CSS as the gorgeous imagery that draws me in . The image replacement techniques can be learned by anyone , but the understanding of good design principles is what sets one design apart from another . <p> I 'm very much happier with the way my work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because of The Garden . Interestingly though , the VERY first time I was struck by the power of CSS from a design perspective had nothing to do with the CSS Zen Garden . It was seeing Eric Meyers complex spiral demo . Just one beautiful image , cleverly deployed with CSS , utterly transformed an otherwise ordinary page . <p> Now if we can get proper IE support for position:fixed and PNGs , we can all be web design gods . <p> I find the CSS Zen Garden site to be a remarkable inspiration . Its awesome to see the work of professionals here , and to see how they solved thorny problems of layout and styling to make beautiful , magical works of art . Its been a great help ( and incentive ) for me to keep improving my own skills , which are decidedly amateurish . <p> Couldnt agree more with your points . I , as an amauter web designer , often begin with other peoples designs . I take them , learn from them , improve upon them , and then I evolve them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accessible and standards-complaint markup is starting with a blank slate - something which often pushes the amauter designer into using table-based layouts generated by WYSIWYG editors . The time and effort that often goes into the first draft discourages the move to complaince . Basing a first draft on popular designs let 's you begin with a complaint design , and you also learn the coding practices from the best on the web ( Zeldman , Shea , Bowman , et al ) . <p> YAAAYYY ! ! ! Let me say , as a designer/developer who is currently re-designing TSN.ca ( Canadas ESPN ) to use a standards compliant , CSS and XHTML 1.1 codebase , I could n't get where I am right now without the lessons Ive learned from ZenGarden . <p> I 've pilfered a goodly many lines of CSS from that site , torn them apart , examined them , and put them back together to get an idea of how the more advanced stuff works , and I 'm forever greatful ! <p> I 've always been concerned about the use of the creative commons license . But not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show stoppers where my concerns do n't  apply . Good to see that you have stuck to your guns . <p> I for one had already started work on a submission for the Garden regardless of your decision . I understand that any entry I submit will be open to abuse . By hacks and professionals alike , sad but true . And Dave , its indeed not something to keep you , and anybody else for that matter , awake at night . Great ideas like the Zen Garden are bigger than the few weak minded souls out there . <p> Somewhat off-topic , but still about the CSS Zen Garden . Is there any place where people can discuss the designs ? I guess a forum of some sort would be nice instead of commenting on the artists/designers blog post if ever he or she blogged about it <p> Patrick dating the submissions is a great idea . I do n't  know why I have n't been doing that all along . Thanks ! <p> Brian TSN is taking the plunge ? Very cool ! Although I guess it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other sports news networks are buying into XTHML/CSS . <p> Matt The discussion leading up to this decision was valuable for everyone totally agreed . I bought heavily into CC when it first hit the scene , but things have become a little clearer lately . I 'm still debating what to do with the licensing on THIS site . Maybe when their next generation licenses come out I 'll have better options . <p> Eugene its been requested in the past , but I wont be pursuing that . If you want to talk about the design , you 'd be better off just e-mailing the designer . <p> When I saw the savings from ESPNs re-design , I decided that we needed to get rid of all of the useless tables . Its been bugging me since we launched last summer that our front page is over 80k of HTML alone . <p> I started using some CSS stuff for layout on sub-sites like the X-Games over the last year , and wanted to really branch out to the entire site . <p> The big stickler was convincing the right folks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ users , and ESPNs decision to do the same was enough of a push . <p> The " We get it moment " was when I took a CSS design , put in TSN branding and colours , then re-did the CSS with CTV , and then re-did the CSS again with Sympatico , and showed the powers that be that the entire site could be changed by simply changing which style sheet was presented . That sold them . " No back end work , but complete flexibility ? Sold ! " <p> I 'm in the process of convincing the Globe and Mail that they need to do the same thing for their impending re-design , but I 'm not getting a lot of buy in due to the fact that they claim 15% of their audience is Netscape 4.7 users . <p> I guess that design stealing is just going to be an inevitable fact of life , and itll happen anywhere that there are ideas worth stealing . <p> When I started using XHTML ( and CSS properly ) earlier this year , it was by looking at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Its important that folks can still look and learn . <p> Finally , the Zen Garden has become the most useful tool to convince my clients ( and programmers that I work with ) of the power , flexibility and benefits of CSS . I always get the same reaction - awe and suprise . Its quite simply the best showcase there is , and the standard of entries just keeps rising . I 'm glad its not going to be spoilt . <p> I am also relieved to hear about your decision to stick with an open license . While usually people give me an image of the layout they want for their site , I look at the CSS of sites like Zen Garden to figure out how to implement the design without tables . Thanks for all the time and consideration you put into the garden . <p> I like your point about the intermediary step .. having lived through the " my niece/nephew could do that better " era .. the truth was so much more than that and CSS is no different . <p> I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was clever ; ) but now the nieces and nephews will need to apply even more impetus no more copying the source and changing the colors/graphics . A bit more is required here , yes they may be able to copy any one particular design , but are they really learning ? ? <p> The fact that " zen " has produced 100+ different designs from the same source means I 'm glad I actually learned this stuff as opposed to copying the source . Until there is is a satisfactory WYSIWYG ( and if IE is anything to go by that wont be for a long time ) to cope with the different browser quirks there will be no substitute for knowledge . <p> Bill its funny , I 've always wondered why programmers have often been so willing to share unique code with each other . After all , programmers are usually very creative and thus like designers in a way . Maybe its because that in learning how to solve certain problems or to get a result examples can be useful as a teaching tool . The ability to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the code is part of a programmers asset . Part of a programmers value . For designers the uniqueness of our work is actually very important not the ability to apply it . Besides the fact that the design has to work , the form should also be functional and effective . Identity and style are also a part of the equation . The end result is unique . Always . <p> The problem is really highlighted by the fact that you cant really tell anybody how to do this . You can guide them and give them the knowledge how to achieve good results . But how to design is a skill and ability one has to develop on their own . Even examples do not help in this regard . They can function as a guide but on the whole that is all they can do . <p> The collection of stylesheets for a site is tied into the design and is in itself unique . The styles designers or web developers code and how its coded should be shared and this is what the Zen Garden is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or copying parts of it is one thing copying the design is another . So its not surprising that designers frown when somebody takes their unique creation and claim it as their own . <p> Good points Egor , and the only thing I would add is that its about recognition . <p> Design is visible . When I do some particularly clever work , you can see how smart I am just by looking at it . <p> Code is invisible . When you put together a particularly clever system , the problem-solving that went into it is invisible , its only the end result which someone can see . Sometimes that 's enough , but the source is really what you want people to see . <p> Its no wonder coders want to share , and show people just how clever they are . Designers do n't  have to do that , because people can tell by just looking at their work . <p> On Bills question , I think there are a couple of other factors at work . <p> With programming , there seem to usually be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problem . ( I say that from limited experience . ) There 's less of that feeling of boundedness with design . <p> Additionally , design is intimately connected to the identity of the designer or the designers organization , client , etcmaking it more like stealing your face than stealing your stuff .

@@99593499 @3793499/ <p> Running your own local Apache server for development is a great idea , and even better if you 've enabled local virtual hosts . <p> As demand for open source software increases , so do the options . Popular packages are frequently ported to different platforms , so its fully possible to run a local install of Apache regardless of which operating system you use on your workstation . <p> The stumbling block is mainly know-how , which is fortunately an easy gap to fill . I am decidedly not a system administrator , but Ive run various Apache installs over the past year without much conviction I should note , so learning has been slow . <p> After this past weekends rebuild , I got around to re-configuring a fresh copy of Apache Complete last night . Here are two tips from that experience . <h> Virtual Hosts <p> Virtual hosts enable you to intelligently run multiple sites on a single server . The useful side effect is that with proper setup , you can point your browser to www.whatever.whatever and load a local copy . My development @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the . com , just faster . I do n't  even need a connection to work on it , because its all local ; all my PHP scripts and Movable Type templates work , and the local filesystem access is so much nicer than using FTP . <p> I 've long been aware of their use , but never committed to learning how to set up virtual hosts in Apache . A conversation with Narayan of Etherfarm on his recent trip through Vancouver enlightened , and its really ridiculously easy , to the point where I wish I 'd done this last year . <p> Find your httpd.conf file , and then add this line somewhere near the bottom ( there 's a spot with example virtual server code , I stuck mine below that ) : <p> NameVirtualHost 127.0.0.1 <p> You might want to run a search for NameVirtualHost within the file before-hand to make sure its not already set , or at least commented out with a preceding octothorpe ( # ) . <p> Next add an entry for localhost pointing to the root of your web server , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up the default site : <p> And finally , for each individual virtual site you wish to run , add a new entry pointing to the proper directory . This is especially useful because , at least on Unix-based systems , this means it can sit anywhere in your filesystem . Im used to dumping all sites in a special www folder and pointing the web server to that ; this way I can simply direct Apache to , in my case , **28;972;TOOLONG and keep all articles , . psd files , and web files in one folder . <h> Host Redirection <p> But here 's the part I did n't  read , which I should have you 're only halfway there once you 've set up Apache . In a bout of doing one thing while having a hunch I should be doing another , I wasted far too much time configuring and re-configuring httpd.conf before realizing I also had to tell my computer where to look for this host I 'd just invented . Its in the articles I linked above , but I missed this step . May you not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ required is editing your local computers hosts file so that your browser is able to resolve the fake names for your development sites . For each entry created in httpd.conf , a corresponding entry needs to exist in your hosts file . Instructions on how to do this vary between operating systems , but its not hard to find tutorials . ( The step-by-step instructions on this evolt article work perfectly in Panther . ) <h> And That 's It ? <p> As long as the directories you 've pointed your virtual hosts to exist , and have files in them , you now have customized local hosts for your sites , on your own computer . Make sure to restart Apache before checking , which may require command line access , depending on your install . Other than that , you 're done . <h> Getting 403 errors ? <p> If you 've done everything above and cant access your new site , due to a 403 Forbidden error , you have a permissions problem . If the directory/files you wish to load havent been given read permission for all users , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a general rule , public-facing directories and files should be at the very least something like 644 or ( - r w - r - - r - - ) , and ideally 755 ( or - r w x r - x r - x ) . If you do n't  know what this means , a quick introduction to Unix permissions in general , chmod in particular is in order . <p> Now , assuming everything looks alright , you may still get a Forbidden error . Turns out this is due to the execute permissions on all folders above the root of your virtual host on the server ; namely , it must be set . For all of them . <p> If you have a directory serving as your root like so : <p> /Users/dave/Sites <p> then every directory above Sites must have execute permissions set for all users . If you 're feeling brave , a quick and easy way to do this on the command line is as follows : <p> cd / sudo chmod -R 755 /Users <p> You will be prompted for your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything in /Users on down the hierarchy to 755 . Fine if you 're in a fairly low-risk situation , like having a firewall in between you and the public internet ( and trusting the local network your machine is attached to ) . Problematic if not . Otherwise , youd simply do it on a per-directory basis : <p> cd / chmod 755 /Users cd Users chmod 755 dave cd dave chmod 755 Sites <p> If necessary , add the sudo command before each chmod line and authenticate as necessary . 30454 @qwx890454 <p> Best way is certainly to set up another machine with apache and as exactly as possible the same configuration as your webserver has . In particular if you developing any PHP based applications or make use of some very special apache features like . htaccess-files or sessions your windows/mac-system probably wont be able to handle . <p> here 's my way : I 'm working with and developing on Win2k ( shame on me ) just because is more comfortable when not working ; - ) My laptop is a dual-OS with Win2k and SuSe Linux . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did with my webserver . Instead of www.mezzoblue.dev I make use of dev.mezzoblue.com e.g. which I defined in my local hosts file . <p> Fortunately Iam able to develop with all comfort I like to have , heavenly speed and with the guarantee that there are no incompatibilities when I upload my scripts . <p> Dave , following your lead , I just wiped the hard drives on my PowerBook and my G5 , and was writing up a virtual hosts article while I was setting everything up again . Many thanks for saving me the effort ! <p> Ill just add a few things : <p> Name-based virtual hosts not only simplify the access to various websites-in-development , they also allow you to more closely match Apache options a client might have turned on or off on their webserver . If a client has indexes turned on , for example , you could turn indexes on ( or off ) for a particular virtual host using apache directives . Between the VirtualHost tags , add ( for example ) : <p> True , you can do this with . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ previous comment , Ive taken to mirroring as closely as possible the server on which a clients site will be running . As such , I have these directives in the the virtual host declaration in the . conf file , then modify them as needed with . htaccess files ( as I would on the " live " site ) . <p> Similarly , within the virtual host declaration , you can specify locations for logs , add file types or modify icon handling , and ( importantly ) , specify scriptalias directories . Basically , you can place almost any apache directive within &lt;VirtualHost&gt; tags , thereby mirroring various clients hosts on a per-virtual host basis . <p> Lastly , I prefer to use /Sites than **28;1002;TOOLONG . I 'm the only one on my machine , and I like to keep my stuff in my user folder , which gets backed up on a regular basis . To do this , I move to **28;1032;TOOLONG and create a symbolic link : <p> $ ln -s /Users/narayan/Sites Documents <p> This way any calls to localhost get automatically sent to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I run behind a firewall and do n't  grant external access off port 80 , so I have no problems doing this . <p> As for transferring MT data from the dev box to a live server , I twice used an SQL dump ( via phpMyAdmin ) to do this successfully , but it was my personal site , so I did n't  care too much if things went awry . I do n't  know if an SQL dump is a recommended practice for MT or if it work if tried again . <p> I just discovered virtual host 2 month ago . I was running two website in development and I use only use relative to root links ( link beginning with a / ) . I had some problem with my PHP include that use relative to root links , they kept pointing in one site only . <p> It might be useful but I 'm only a designer , its getting to be too much for me , I might be a real geek but configuring my Apache server and host file is way out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on my OpenBSD laptop . One thing I was considering is setting up all my URIs to be a php variable so I can drop the new code into the live site with one change . I do n't  like relative URIs as a personal preference - I 've made too many mistakes with the number of directory levels to go up or down . What I 'm considering is having every URI be of the form **25;1062;TOOLONG and declaring $host to be the local copy of the site , in your case $host= " www.mezzoblue.dev " . Then , when I move it over to the real server , all I need to do is adjust the $host variable to be $host= " www.mezzoblue.com " . I 'd be interested to know if anyone else has ideas on the best way to handle such things , or if I 'm overlooking some major issue that 's going to come back and bite me . <p> i use a similar setup . but one thing i wish is that the rendezvous ( opentalk ? ) support for apache would just automatically lay claim to any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ step of tweaking the /etc/hosts file , and make those virtual hosts available to other local machines ( assuming you 're using NameVirtualHost * and not just NameVirtualHost 127.0.0.1 ) . <p> Like Dave , I use . dev for development work . I *also* have a . static set of domains if I 'm running a site that generates static pages destined for the live site . So , on my business site , roberthahn.ca , I have on my machine roberthahn.dev and roberthahn.static for development and staging servers . <p> The first tip I want to contribute might not be an amazing revelation , but here t is : If you can swing it , try to set up a directory structure that exactly matches what the live servers is . This structure should extend above the web root as well , in case some of your scripts need filesystem-based root-oriented paths to files or other scripts . This paves the way to a zero-tweak staging-to-live server move . <p> The second tip has to do with where you put your virtual host information . Dave suggests editing the httpd.conf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you should be aware of one important gotcha : every time you update your operating system , if it includes an update to Apache , then Apple will replace your httpd.conf file in favour of theirs , which will cause you to lose all your virtual host configuration . <p> An I idea I saw that I think I can credit to Rael Dornfest is to create a virtual.conf file in /etc/httpd/users/ . In this file , you put all your virtual hosting configuration . Once you restart Apache , it will automatically load all files found in that users/ directory , including the virtual.conf . The benefits : you keep all the virtual host configs in one place , and it will never be overwritten by Apple . <p> Quick question for everyone . I have a local apache configuration , but I have n't installed movable type because of synchronization . When you work locally , what is your procedure for synchronization up to the live server ? Aside from a manual copy using FTP , is there a more elegant solution ? <p> " every time you update @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Apache , then Apple will replace your httpd.conf file in favour of theirs " <p> If you 're using the copy of Apache built-in to OS X , that 's true . I 've installed the Complete Apache package from Server Logistics http : **33;1089;TOOLONG and it sticks all config files in its own directory . Problem solved . ( The Complete packages offer extra options that most people love , although I find their control panel applets a little buggy ) <p> When you work locally , what is your procedure for synchronization up to the live server ? <p> I 'm doing it two ways . First , all my templates are saved as external files in a /templates/ directory , so those go via FTP . Second , all data is easily exportable from the MT admin interface , so I just export and import all entries/comments as needed . ( I 'm sure there 's a better way to do this if you 're a database person , but I 'm not , so Export works great . ) <p> The only thing this leaves is manual configuration of preferences and archives and things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and its a pain , but you only have to do it once . <p> No real reason to transfer the actual generated . html pages themselves , those can easily be re-generated once you have the data/templates set up properly . <p> I 'm just starting to set this stuff up myself , but ive decided it would be best for my situation to have one config file for each virtual host like www.theredhead.nl.vhost and dev.theredhead.nl.vhost etc. in a virtualhosts directory . This way i can set up individual virtualhosts through safari using my own php stuff super easy . <p> Now all i need to get all this working is figure out how to get this to live next to my router in peace . it works from the lan , but not from the web as is now . <p> I just actually set up something like this yesterdayI am using a Rendexvous base station with its own IP , so I set up ports on the base station IP for each site , and then added these ports to net info manager in os x . Works @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the domains through the name alone ( e.g. http : //arkitrave ) , I have to use 10.0.1.2:8086 . I do n't  know why this is , as this IP is in the /hosts fileBut it does work across the entire intranet via the port address , which is what I really need to work . <p> I also configured a localhost page to access the files from the laptop when it is n't plugged into the network , via the 127. address . <p> I have n't seen a lot written about using virtual hosts with a networked system and a wireless station , so I 'm just experimenting and throwing out the stuff that does n't  work . <p> In response to the comment by Martin-Lucas Smith , I 'm not sure what your point is . I 'm saying that I do n't  like relative URIs . If I 'm in **26;1124;TOOLONG and I want to go to **26;1152;TOOLONG , I prefer to use **26;1180;TOOLONG instead of .. / .. / .. /dir4/dir5/dir6 for the link to that page . Maybe I confused the issue by saying file versus page . Hope that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ module for apache . Bascially you give apache a root directory to look into , and then just stick your site directories in there . Apache uses the host : header to then look for your directory . <p> E.g. /www/vhtdocs/ is the root directory you then add a directory called www.mysite.com ( no apache reboot or configuration file tweeking needed ) call up www.mysite.com , and apache will serve out the contents of the **28;1208;TOOLONG directory . <p> V. Useful if you are working on multiple sites , or need to quickly set sites up without wanting to fiddle with the apache configuration file . <p> Very useful article . I finally got around to setting up my v-hosts yesterday after reading this . I use Fedora Core 2 and the process couldnt be easier .

The way I worked around that was to give my host machine ( a beige G3 running OS X.2.8 ) a static IP and then either access the site from the VPC via the IP or edit the VPCs hosts file . <p> That works great if you 're using a router to handle your Net connection , but I 'm not sure it could be made to work if you 're connecting the host machine directly to a modem as the machine would be getting a dynamic IP from your ISP everytime you connect . That is , your IP would keep changing on you . <p> Regardless , I eventually got tired of editing Netinfo on the Mac and hosts files on all 4 VPCs ( this was prior to the discovery that yes , Virginia , there is a way to run multiple versions of IE/Win on the same PC ) , my VAIO and my GFs Dell . <p> Instead , I set up BIND on the OS X machine ( there 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ OS X.2.x , here : http : **33;1297;TOOLONG ) . I configured it to be a caching-only server , and to only respond to requests from machines on the same LAN ( there are instructions for both at the aforementioned URL ) . Then I set up zone files for each of the domains I wanted ( all my various . dev sites ) and set up BIND to handle them . Finally , I added the Macs IP to the DNS servers list on all my machines ( virtual and otherwise ) . <p> From that point on , setting up a new site was as simple as adding a new domain to BIND and a new host to apacheno more Netinfo , no more hosts files . Set it up on the Mac and all the machines in the apartment would recognize it instantly . <p> If you 're looking to set up canonical domains on Win32 ( with apache ) I have an article i wrote a while ago that might help . Its a little rough ( not to mention badly formatted ) but it should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In Panther , NetInfo was moved in the lookup order , so adding your domain to NetInfo will work only if DNS resolution fails . For fake top-level domains like . dev that will always happen , but if you 're using a fake subdomain of a real domain or a new domain name that 's registered but not live yet , the response you get back will depend on how that domains DNS is set up . You may not be able to see the local page . There are several solutions to the problem ; I switched the lookup order back to the pre-Panther version . <p> A quick note about moving smoothly from development to staging to live servers , which was discussed above ( comment #4 , by Robert Hahn ) . Using apache virtual hosts for this works , but it is still a little too static for my tastes . In some situations , you simply can not mirror the directory stucture ( " above " the web root , at least ) of the live machine on the development/staging machine . <p> What I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work well too ) to define all the different paths ( e.g. , document root , web root , cgi bin , ) that I will use in building the website . Call these the " logical paths " . For each logical path , I specify three separate physical paths ( one for the developement , staging , and testing server , respectively ) . Then , I use a PHP ( insert your scripting language of choice ) function to select which path should be used based on the current servers hostname . <p> 2 . If you are behind a HTTP proxy server , you need to add your domains to " Bypass these domains " under System Preferences &gt; Network &gt; Proxies . ( " *. dev " works just fine ) Took me way to long to figure that out ! 
@@99593500 @3793500/ <p> If you 're not aware of it yet , HTML5 boilerplate is a fantastic starting point when creating a new site with its namesake markup language . <p> But where Boilerplate focuses on basic document setup , external files , scripts , and bug fixes , it strikes me that it does n't  do much hand-holding when it comes to basic document semantic patterns . As I 've been working more and more HTML5 into my projects , I 'm noticing a common template emerging . <p> I 'm sharing this as a minimum viable starting point since I 'm still getting comfortable with the new semantics myself . Combined with Boilerplate , I 'm feeling more and more confident that I 'm beginning to use HTML5 properly . Do n't  consider it canonical by any means , there 's likely a lot of room for improvement and its most certainly wrong in places . Comments / suggestions for improvement are more than welcome . <p> Youll notice I 'm a believer in reserving h1 headings for the page title , and not the site / company name . I 'm still not sure I get how to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school h1-h6 for now . <p> Thanks to the pave the cowpaths philosophy that guided HTML5 development , it feels almost too easy . Its not much more than a tweak to my previous XHTML template : change a few ids to their corresponding elements here and there , replace various divs with sections , articles and asides where relevant , and add / remove extra attributes where necessary . Done . <p> Using section for wrapping content is n't really what its for . For wrapping general content using a div is ideal . section has its purposes but not going to go into all that - check the link below for tons of useful info . <p> Same thing as using aside for sidebar . It can be used as a sidebar but is really to be used for smaller bit of content related to a larger piece of content . <p> If you really want to be semantic and use it correctly there 's much more thought that goes behind choosing which element to use rather than just changing divs into sections and sidebars into asides . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the document . It does n't  make sense to intentionally avoid using an h1 in a sectioning root that has child sections - if you do , the section/document will remain untitled or be given an implicit title anyway . <p> Putting scripts in the bottom of the page by default is a good habit to be in . Scripts block the browser from rendering while they execute due to the chance that the script might perform a document.write() or similar page-modifying tasks . By placing scripts after the majority of page content you guarantee that the content will be rendered before the script halts the show . So while the page is n't done and the loading spinner may still spin , at least people have a useful web page to spend their time with . <p> Aside from the flawed omission of the sitename as an H1 ( mentioned this in a comment that has n't  been approved yet : / ) , I 'm also confused by the " secondary-nav " div . The use of an ASIDE element is justified in its place , depending on what it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unwrapped ? <p> If you are using a header tag I 'm pretty sure you need to have at least one h1-h6 tag present . Adding a role= " banner " attribute to your masthead on page gives it more semantic meaning as to what it is for this current page . <p> You can also use the role= " main " attribute to distinguish your main content section from the rest . Using roles will eventually allow you to drop your accessibility navigation altogether as assistive technology will recognise the areas of your document . Your footer tag could have a role applied to it too . <p> I would agree with the other commenters here and wrap your navigation items in a nav tag . <p> I 'm already trying to use ( almost ) only h1s on Gastero Prod , and even created a stylesheet for multi level sectioned h1 styles . The ( obvious ) name is HTML5-Titles-Inception , and freely available/forkable on Github : LONG ... <p> @Vladimir Carrer upon first glance it looks like were sharing a lot of common patterns between our templates . Major @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ header , and how many items we each define within the page . I think both approaches potentially work , though I 'd also be interested in hearing various arguments for and against how your template is setup . <p> @DRoss yes , I read HTML5 Doctor , do you ? Ill grant perhaps section usage could be debated , but here 's an article where they state the opposite of what you did about aside usage : <p> @CHJJ @kaidex re : not using h1 for a site title , this is n't new to HTML5 . For years now we 've been debating whether to reserve it for the page title or not . For accessibility and SEO reasons , there appears to be a solid argument against using it as the site title . Its a habit Ive been in for a while , and I 'd have to see some pretty strong counter-arguments to break it . Commenters saying it should be done otherwise is n't enough to sway me . <p> Dave , I understand that - that 's what I 'm saying : The positions that have been held for years on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the face of HTML5 . Omitting a sitename as the H1 in the body does n't  make sense if you also have a heading inside an explicit ( main content ) section - the body/document gets an implied title anyway according to the outlining algorithm . <p> On the secondary navigation , I do n't  think I said anything about a nav element in my previous comments . <p> Is there a reason you kept the accessibility links outside of the banner header instead of inside ? Ive been debating on whether it should stay out as its own or not . The spec seems to allow it and possibly encourage it ; though , I 'm not sure how screen readers and search engines would treat them differently . <p> Personally , I would n't use a section element for the role= " main " chunk of content . <p> Remember that the body element is also sectioning content ( like section , article , nav and aside ) so what you 've got in your template is a piece of sectioning content ( body ) that has a header and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ div ) . <p> Thanks for the starting point Dave . Like you Ive been using the boilerplate template and still trying to get my head around the new semantics in HTML5 . I think I have adapted a similar structure as you have used here in new sites I 'm developing . I also agree with you on the use of H1s as page titles ! Cheers <p> One more argument for not using section for the main content - sometimes you will have only one article element on the page and you will want its header to be h1 - a single post page for example . This will leave the section element without its own header , and we all know sections need headers . <p> Ingwa , you 're wrong . Things do n't  work that way currently if you 're using explicit sections for your content . Read the document outlining algorithm . A sitename in an h1 replaced with a logo is perfectly reasonable , and I would even argue that it is necessary . <p> Gonzo , you 're right . If Dave is n't using the sitename @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ using an explicit section for his content . <p> On another note , there are also other things wrong with this boilerplate , such as the use of HEADER as if it were an HGROUP . These boilerplates are very harmful in my opinion . <p> CHJJ , I think the header element inside the article is OK . Since this is just a boilerplate , when used properly , additional information may go in the header . Also there are strong opinions against the hgroup element and I agree that when you have h1 and h2 inside a header , adding a hgroup element is redundant . <p> The arguments against HGROUP stem from its awkward unintuitive usage , but that 's a different story - the fact is , Dave is using HEADER here as if it were an HGROUP ( regardless of whether the HGROUP element was a good idea in the first place ) . A HEADER element does not remove the trailing heading content from the document outline . HEADER and HGROUP have completely different meanings . It does not perform the same function : it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all there is to it . There 's no wiggle room there . <p> This may seem unnecessry or obsessive at first . But for users who depend on screen readers , its a boon . Think about this . I know a sidebar is a sidebar because I can see that it sits to one side . That position on the page tells me that the information contained therein is secondary in some way , ancillary to the main content . A screen reader does n't  know that . But a suitable heading will make it clear : " Sidebar " or " Secondary Content " or " Related Resources " etc . Similarly with a menu : how does a user know that a list is the site navigation unless he/she can see that its placed prominently with an eye-catching design , or a suitable title signals its role ? Bottom line : we should place a suitable heading in each nav and aside and header , but use CSS position:absolute ; top:0 ; text-indent : -9000em to remove those headings from the viewport . <p> However , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " body title " . That will place many developers in a quandary , because we expect the top of the document outline tree to be our page heading . But our page heading ( in most cases ) will be in the article ( or section ) - which is one level down in the document outline . Perhaps the best solution at present is to put some combination of the site name , section name and page name in a heading in header , but remove it from the viewport ( see above ) . 
@@99593501 @3793501/ <p> The css Zen Garden has been desperate for some TLC for a while now . Submissions have been increasing steadily ( sometimes 6 or 7 per day ) , but management and archiving has been a frustrating problem for quite some time . So I fixed some of the major problems . <h> Categorization <p> Since its launch on this domain over two years ago , the css Zen Garden archives have undergone numerous changes to cope with the growing volume of designs . <p> It seems hard to believe now , but at one point in time all designs I had received fit on one page . When that page grew too weighty , I chopped it into a handful of categories and gave each of those their own page . Then they had to be further subdivided into their own series of pages . <p> However , the categories themselves have become mostly meaningless , with Conceptual becoming a default placeholder for just about any non-official design , unless I found a way to cram it into one of the other categories instead . <p> But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or adding a large degree of automation to the publishing process . So I opted for automation . <h> Automation <p> After spending the better part of last year writing a book on the site , it became obvious that my manual addition process was going to need to be addressed , and soon . So in January or so I started tinkering with MySQL databases to see what I could come up with . <p> By February , all new submissions were going into a database . Not a very good database , mind you , but it was enough to allow me to write a quick manager for the site during the spring . All submissions went into a database , which allowed me to categorize and automatically generate HTML that I could copy and paste into various templates . Handy , but not good enough . <p> About a month back , I needed help screen-scraping the list of Zen Garden designs . This was to facilitate Version 2 of the manager , which would contain a full database of all Zen Garden designs , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barring some publishing settings which will take a bit longer to enable , its finally done . The publishing workflow is almost completely automated , so all I have to do upon categorizing a design is hit the big Publish button . ( Official designs take a bit more manual work , but that 's a necessary evil . ) <h> Archive Improvements <p> So now that I can update the site without planning my schedule in advance , what can we expect ? <p> Well immediately , you 'll see that the archives finally have screenshots . Its been a long time coming , and the lack of having them has bugged me too . Now that I spend less time updating , I can spend a bit more time to grab these for the official designs . This is a manual process , which involves Safari and Photoshop until it can be automated on the server as well ( and I have my doubts this is possible , barring an API from BrowserCam or similar ) , screenshots will only exist for official designs . Well see what this does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do fun things like creating recently added designs lists , and even offer an alternative archive format in the View Designs By Date page . This is a bit broken for existing designs due to missing publish dates creating metadata manually is no fun at all , thanks but it ought to become a lot more useful as new designs are added . <p> The categorization problem above ? So fixed . Now instead of a handful of meaningless categories , designs can exist in any number of the 50+ categories which describe things like layout type , dominant colours , and themes . I 'm basically treating them as tags , and can add new ones at any time . For now , I 've only re-categorized the 180 official designs , but as new ones come in I 'll be more accurately categorizing any and all that get published . The new problem is going to be categorizing the categories ; I 've reserved a group column in the table for precisely that , whch will be implemented in due time . <p> What else ? Oh , a couple new RSS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The designs listed are screwy at the moment ( expect them to be completely innaccurate ) and I 'm not 100% convinced they do what they 're supposed to yet , that will take a few updates to figure out . But you can expect theyll eventually work . <h> Long Term <p> So that solves a few problems , and leaves a couple of questions hanging about what has yet to be done : <p> How about Comments/Ratings ? <p> I 've considered comments , but I 'm not going to do it . Browse any major CSS design listing site to experience first hand why not . Anonymous commentary-free ratings might be a possibility , but very low priority . <p> Ads ? <p> No . Well , kind of . Since I 've spent far more ( billable ) time than I should have on this upgrade , I 'm likely going to run some ads on the archive pages for a few months . Only to recoup the costs , and then theyll be removed . I have a specific dollar value in mind , so theyll only run until that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's relevant to the type of people likely to be viewing the Zen Garden , get in touch . Otherwise itll just be AdSense . <p> Why are the archives still on mezzoblue.com ? <p> Legacy and overhead . The site was originally launched on this domain , and since the purpose of the site is to re-skin a common body of content after all , picking just one of those and just using it for the archives and supporting material seemed a little silly . But forcing submitters to style more variations would have been more time-consuming for them , and the barrier to entry would be a lot higher . This was a real concern at the time , so I dropped the supporting material in this sites template to side-step the problem . <p> At some point I think there will be a master design for the supporting material , which will then see it and the archives pushed over to the csszengarden.com domain . At that point , the page that greets you when you visit the site will change to more of an explanation/design listing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact that I cant change the markup structure these days . But I 'm not quite ready for that step yet . <p> Is it still relevant ? <p> Truth be told , my idea of what the site is has changed quite a bit recently , perhaps yours has too . Keeping in mind that its a lot of things to a lot of people , and designers new to CSS are still stumbling across it for the first time every day , its original purpose has n't  gone away . But for those of us who get CSS design now , and that 's a significant lot of us , the initial impact has long since faded . <p> What was reinforced to me as I went through the archives for screenshots and categorization , is what a wide and diverse body of work we 've created . Hundreds of designers are solving the exact same problem in so many diverse and unique ways . That work continues to be relevant , and although much has changed about the techniques and coding we use in the past few years , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are a lot of them . And there will continue to be more of them . <p> As it says in the wording of the site , which is long obsolete , " One day this gallery will be a historical curiosity ; that day is not today . " This may be true of the markup that makes up the site ( more divs and classes than necessary today ) , the site navigation ( woefully inadequate ) , and even the wording itself ( oh how I wish I could edit ) , the main point of the site the designs people submit will continue to be relevant as long as I continue to receive them . <p> The categorization is much easier to browse what you 're looking for from a newbie standpoint . However the oldies that knew exactly where to look for an old design in a long large listit can become daunting . But no big deal . It needed it . <p> I 'd still like to see a ZenBrowser which browses the templates through a framed browser , much like the themes for WordPress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the automated screenshot front - perhaps you could use SnapWeb ( http : **35;1332;TOOLONG ) along with some Applescript to resize and upload the screenshot ? <p> I 've a little experience myself with this after building SiteVista ( http : //www.sitevista.com/ ) - its similar to BrowserCam . <p> If you ever have a crack at it and get stuck , drop me an email , I could send you some sample Applescript that I wrote to do the Safari tests in SiteVista . <p> Come now Dave , you know there are people who are more than willing to donate . Of course usually in the world of freelance web design , we are usually tight on money , especially the young among us ( Ahem , myself . ) . <p> Bill - Yes , a broken list is definitely in the works for future upgrades . I did some pretty careful weeding a month or two ago , but its an ever-changing thing . Further complicating matters is that sometimes the servers are just down for a while , or slow , and so removing it outright @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the designer asking me why I removed it . I have some ideas on this , but its not the highest item on the priority list yet . <p> Brian / Paul - Thanks for the suggestions , I came across both Papparazzi and Site Vista in my searches , but Snapweb is new to me . I suspect the bandwidth concern is the bigger problem of the two , though . <p> Joseph - thanks , but I 'm not looking for donations . Given the book , the site toes a funny line between commercial ( albeit indirectly so ) and non-profit . I like to think of it as the latter , but the argument could be made toward the former . For tax purposes , and just plain the sense that donating to a site that indirectly benefits me seems wrong , I 'm not considering donations . <p> Re : broken sites . The answer is so simple ( and has been suggested to Dave before ) : just host all the entries on Mezzoblue ! Then absolutely nothing will ever happen to them , unless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will remain 100% intact , a true historical record . <p> Otherwise , its a case of clicking each one to find several do n't  work . After a few seconds staring at an unstyled screen , I cancel the attempt , and go back to try another entry instead . Not good . That 's always been a problem here . <p> I doubt they would take up much server space , so how about it ? <p> As for donations , many people would be more than willing to support the site . It seems strange not to have them set up , especially if it paid for extra server space to host all those designs ( hint ) . I guess Dave has some moral objections to them , which of course , I respect . I just do n't  feel ads would cover a tiny fraction of the potential revenue from donations . <p> Well , letting people leave comments on each design would open a can of worms . Dave do not go that road please . <p> It would be great if each designer is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way he did , thus viewers are allowed to see what went on the designers mind . That would only be fair to both viewers and designers as the viewer would feel obliged to read the design notes before he rubbishes a particular design . <p> I have an idea . Why not write a CSS Zen Garden 2 with a detailed look at the designs on the Zen Garden ? It would be the collaborative work of all the contributors in a way for a complete and better understanding of CSS for the readers . <p> I second Olivers idea : CSS Zen Garden , version 2 . A new HTML page , with new text , navigation and the rest ; designers submitting new Zen Garden designs would use the version 2 HTML , and the version 1 HTML would be kept in an archive section . <p> You could launch this at the same time you launch the support site . Of course , youve probably had just about enough of all this Zen Garden nonsense for the moment ! <p> On another note , I got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! ) ; nice . I look forward to getting Mollys signature at WE05 ( and yours ? ) . <p> I wanted to refer someone having questions about horizontal designs to a couple of Garden entries a while ago , and never got around to digging them up ; in the past ten minutes before posting this comment , I not only found the examples I had in my head , but a whole bunch of others , too ! <p> The categorization is much easier to browse what you 're looking for from a newbie standpoint . However the oldies that knew exactly where to look for an old design in a long large listit can become daunting . But no big deal .

@@99593502 @3793502/ <p> That 's it . I 'm totally over HTML for slides . Done . Finished . The straw that broke the camels back : frantic last minute browser testing on a plane under Virtual PC as my computers battery meter inched ever closer to the red zone because after spending two solid weeks creating material and producing my slides , testing in IE6 just somehow slipped in the list of priorities . <p> I 've tried out a few management methods for making HTML slides easier to create and work with , including PHP for the individual slides , as well as S5 . Anything I use keeps coming back to the same problem though : HTML slides , the way I produce them , require far , far more effort than they 're worth . <p> Lately Ive been moving well away from bullet points for my slides , and more toward imagery and low-verbage concepts . I also choose to build cohesive , visually unique slides , and as best I can , try to ensure the audience has a reason to load them up after the talk ; I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ footnotes " for my presentation , for example . <p> The theory is nice . Present from the same slides as I hand out , and people can click through the URLs , revisit the examples I gave , etc. etc . Hypertext seems like a good addition to my standard set of slides , from a users perspective . <p> But along with that come issues like navigation , screen resolution , production , and testing . Its not enough to rely on non user-facing keyboard shortcuts to flip through the slides , I have to expose them somehow for people viewing the slides later . ( S5 has an elegant way of dealing with this , but its an issue with any other slide management system . ) Its not enough to simply design your slide layout and the component slides , I have to then output images from my graphics editor of choice and produce the HTML . Its not enough to simply test in the browser I 'll be presenting in , I have to test in the various browsers my audience might be using . Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than once , I 'll likely have to account for both 800x600 and 1024x768 projectors ( and then the users screen resolution on top of that . ) That 's about three steps more than I think should be necessary , and there were even more issues that popped up during this last round that I wo n't even get into here . <p> Essentially , for the types of slides I build , producing the material for a one hour talk feels like it requires almost the same amount of work as I 'd devote to producing a 40 or 50 page web site , which is simply silly . A web site gets continual traffic from numerous visitors over long periods of time ; its worth the effort . A presentation is a short , time-limited event with a few hundred people at most , and the only reason any material is necessary afterward is to remind people of what they viewed , and in some cases to provide them further information if they 're interested in following up . <p> So I bought Keynote . And with the exception of events @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my own , I cant see myself using much else from this point forward . It has its disadvantages ( in that providing supporting material seems a weak spot at the moment ) but if I can devote more of my time to the material I 'll be talking about , and less on stupid redundancies like browser testing and navigation , I think the good easily outweighs the bad . <p> Update : Okay , let me elaborate a bit since I 'm getting a bit of response , and I ( purposely ) left comments off . Based on how I create slides ( key words ) , this is what I 'd have to do to build a presentation in S5 or PHP : <p> Design slide template . <p> Design individual slides . <p> Convert slide template to HTML . <p> Figure out how to implement my template in S5/PHP . <p> Implement it . <p> Create navigation . ( optional in S5 ) <p> Test in various browsers . <p> here 's my process in Keynote : <p> Design slide template . <p> Design individual slides . <p> Export @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ required by the steps that Keynote eliminates , its a no-brainer . The disadvantage is yes , I realize the post-presentation materials suffer for it a bit ( Keynotes export options are n't  great ) but with all the time I save I can create a few supplementary options that are equal to or better than an HTML version of the slide show .

@@99593503 @3793503/ <p> Ah , at last ! Ive been looking forward to writing this up for a while now , one of my latest projects just went live . Rosenfeld Media is a brand new publishing company for our industry , with a bit of a twist . Instead of putting out a few epic doorstopper technical manuals each month , the books are going to be short , focused , and will take advantage of technology unlike any other traditional publisher . <p> The founder , Louis Rosenfeld , is a name a lot of you are likely familiar with . I 've had the pleasure of working together with Lou over the past few months on the visual identity for the company , the web site design , and the technical implementation , as well as a few other things still to come . This is one of the broadest projects Ive tackled yet , as I 've spent my days living in Illustrator , InDesign , Photoshop , Movable Type , BBEdit and ssh in almost equal chunks . <p> The site itself has a few goodies you might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and see how we 've dealt with that . Big thanks to Cameron Adams for writing what 's proving to be one of my favourite scripts in the past year . <p> Almost all the content on the site is being managed through Movable Type . I 've learned that if you treat the output MT generates as little content modules , instead of full pages , you can do some pretty powerful stuff with common include files and some selective PHP . I 'm still a little annoyed that I have to flatten my HTML for the sake of comment . cgi pages , and my PHP scripts for working around that were always more trouble than they 're worth . Still , starting with a clean slate with Movable Type 3.2 on this site opened my eyes to some of the great new stuff they 've been adding recently , since I have n't been upgrading my templates on this here site to take advantage of them yet . If you 're still old school and running MT like me , 3.2 is a worthwhile upgrade . <p> A big congratulations to Lou and the rest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new venture , and if you would like to throw your two cents in about what sort of books you would like to see , go tell em ! 30455 @qwx890455 30451 @qwx890451 <p> You are reading " Site Launch : Rosenfeld Media " , an entry posted on 13 January , 2006 , to the Wall Centre Blossoms collection .

@@99593504 @3793504/ <p> The first IE7 Beta is out . Yes , there are CSS improvements . No , they 're not going to change the world . <p> Yesterday , Microsoft released a beta of the forthcoming Vista operating system , along with the first beta of IE7 . Unfortunately , both are only available to MSDN subscribers . <p> An XP-compatible versionis available from a third party if you have a BitTorrent client . This is probably breaking all sorts of terms and conditions though , and likely wont last . Grab it while you can . ( Update : Upon further investigation , the site in question is a BitTorrent tracking site with links to all sorts of other copyrighted material . Since an XP-compatible version of the beta wasnt announced , I 'm guessing its probably not a good idea for me to recommend that anyone download it . So , do n't  . ) My review is based on this version , so if there are significant differences between it and the version that comes with Vista , then this review may be inaccurate . <p> The first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ IE6 , which has been typical IE behaviour since , well , forever . Hence the classic problem of testing multiple versions on one system , until Joe Maddalone came along two years ago and solved the problem for us . Now we need to add a new version to the list of IE archives for the time being , you can grab the IE6 Eolas Edition which is n't functionally different from regular IE6 ( except for the annoying Click Here to Continue Loading this page dialogues ) and it will work as expected alongside IE7b1 and your older archives . <p> Functionally , we should all know by now that things like enhanced security , RSS support , and tabs are included . here 's a screenshot of how it came together , which through its incompleteness re-enforces the fact that this is just a beta . What 's that blank button next to the tab ? Clicking on it opens a new tab . Can anyone spare an icon ? ( My guess is that this looks a little better in Vista ) <p> The odd new toolbar layout with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ direction for the UI ; the only customizable items appear to be the address bar , buttons , and links panels at the bottom , and they can not be moved higher up within the toolbar . ( IE6 , in comparison , let 's you remix to your hearts content . ) <p> So what about the rendering ? Things have changed , but obviously we were promised only very little for a reason nothing much has been fixed . Yes , now we have PNG transparency . ( compare Panics Audion Faces page in IE6 and IE7 ) Yes , the Peekaboo ( IE6 , IE7 ) and Guillotine ( IE6 , IE7 , how the test case is supposed to look ) bugs appear to have been addressed . Though without having had a chance to test either very comprehensively , I 'll hold off on saying theyve actually been fixed just yet . <p> And what about previously unsupported CSS2 properties ? Have we got : hover support on any element other than a yet ? Sorry . What about selectors ? Same as ever . Could we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Keep wishing . <p> Yeah , after four years of suspense , all we get is an alpha channel . Sorry to be the bearer of bad news , but the IE team kept their mouths shut for a reason ; they delivered what was promised , and nothing more . here 's to IE7.5 , I guess <p> Our goal is to get feedback from this group , do a bunch more work around quality ( performance , security , reliability , etc. ) and some features ( e.g. additional standards support beyond what 's in beta 1 , additional functionality around tabs and RSS , etc. ) , and release Beta 2 much more broadly . <p> So , the IE team has committed to the final release of IE7 having improved CSS support over what was released in beta 1 . Let 's hope the improvement is substantial . ( Thanks , Kevin ) <p> Third Update : Oh good , I was hoping we 'd get something like this . The IE team has responded to the IE7 Beta feedback with a roadmap of sorts , which clarifies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Beta 2 will see quite a bit more CSS support than the first beta . <p> How much longer before its out of beta ? Meaning is it too late for them to add these features ? Maybe they are in the works ? Can I have a paragraph of nothing but questions and its stil considered a paragraph ? <p> " Our goal is to get feedback from this group , do a bunch more work around quality ( performance , security , reliability , etc. ) and some features ( e.g. additional standards support beyond what 's in beta 1 , additional functionality around tabs and RSS , etc. ) , and release Beta 2 much more broadly . " <p> " CSS Updates - Internet Explorer 7 includes fixes for issues with the Cascading Style Sheets ( CSS ) feature . Both the peekaboo and guillotine bugs have been addressed , and work on other issues is under way to provide web developers with reliable and robust CSS functionality . " <p> From what I understand , one of the main reasons that there is such a lack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in order for them to truly integrate things such as Tabs , and a number of the CSS bugs they 're facing , they would have to completely rewrite the browser essentially they 're just being lazy and going the easy way out . <p> Does it really matter now that there are other browsers out there ? I used to think a better IE would make a difference . <p> But really , with the slow adoption rate of Vista ( whenever it may make it to market ) and IE7 , we will still have to continue the freakish hacks that we already employ for years to come to accomodate IE 5. x and 6 . IE7 may introduce new hacks as well . To me , this is all more work . I 'd prefer IE stay stagnant as long as possible . <p> What the hell have they been doing for the past four years ? If I owned a software company , and it took my developers four years to do THIS , I 'd fire them and kick them in the shins for good measure . This has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm surprised . Compared to full standards support , PNG support is merely a token gesture <p> Perhaps the best thing to come out of IE7 will be the fact that millions of people will come to know and love ideas such as tabbed browsing and RSS feedsand from there its a short step to more functional browsers . <p> It seems that with this release , IE is just trying to play catch up with the features now provided in other browsers . This should give Firefox and the others more time to innovate and gain ground on IEs market share . Well that 's the theory : ) <p> These guys do n't  want to make a bad product . As I said above , standards is not in the IE product blueprint yet . Why would it be ? It wo n't get them any more or less browser share , not commensurate with the amount of work they would need to put in to it anyway . <p> Give them time , and it will come . But it will always be second to their financial and other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BETA 1 , its a simple reason : the product is n't finished yet . <p> Much more interesting will be to see what all changes between beta 1 and 2 , then 2 and 3 . Its during those periods that most software tends to undergo the biggest changes and also the most interesting ones . That 's my experience from " some " years of software development , anyway . Biggest steps were always around beta 5 . <p> " - Why is Microsoft unwilling to fix the CSS bugs that everyones been asking it to fix for ages ? I think its not unwilling but unable to do so . Explorers code engine can not be updated any more . " - <p> On hiding PNG transparency hacks you can use conditional comments so that they 're only loaded by IE &lt;= 6 . Yeah , it means putting the style rules in the &lt;head&gt; element ( or linking to them in a separate stylesheet ) , but it should at least work . <p> A beta , unless I 'm mistaken , is supposed to be a code and feature-complete @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an alpha a beta because they do n't  want it to be obvious how much behind schedule they are , or they 're not planning any significant changes for the final Vista release . <p> Re : hiding IE6 hacks from IE7 , the other day over at Collys ( LONG ... ) I suggested the conditional comment " if IE lt 7 " , which should serve the contents of the comment ( be it a hacked stylesheet or Bob Osolas script solution ) to all versions of IE below 7 while IE7+ passes it by . Assuming , of course , that IE7 continues to support conditional comments and that it indeed identifies itself as version 7 . I have n't actually laid hands on the beta to test it ( anybody wan na try it ? ) but its tidy in theory . <p> I 'm a Mac user , myself , and I 'm currently choosing to be " too cool for IE " in my designs - putting the onus on visitors to use a real browser and refusing to hack my layouts to suit IE. My clients have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can say is this . Why on Earth should such a huge company with such deep pockets and such intelligence within its workforce ( I do n't  assume they 're all idiots ) have its head so totally up its ass regarding the now thoroughly widespread and well-supported standards movement ? <p> I just do n't  get it . Safari is n't perfect , but at least Apple tries to make it work as cleanly as possible . Why is Microsoft so different ? <p> " I 'm guessing its probably not a good idea for me to recommend that anyone download it . So , do n't  . " <p> Question : is n't it a little hypocritical to leave the link in and then tell people not to download it ? If you really do n't  want people to download it , why did n't  you take out the link ? And if you do want people to download it , why pretend you care about the legality of it ? <p> As a casual web designer , this is disappointing , but I must say : I 'm more interested in improved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love both , of course , but for the 90% of web users out there on Win/IE , I 'd rather have them see the web not-quite-perfect but securely rather than pixel-perfect and vulernable to spyware . <p> I was curious to see where they were at with this , but not quite curious enough to actually download it myself . ( I 'm not sure how I 'd feel about this rogue torrent-version beta replacing my IE6 even if it only ever gets used for testing and WinUpdate . ) <p> kevin : " If better CSS support does n't  make it into the final version , I think that would be the appropriate time for the complaining to begin . " <p> You can not be serious ! Considering how little work Microsoft do on improving their browser , you want us all to wait until *after* the final product is released and then start complaining ? I say raise hell now and they might actually do some work to make IE better . <p> And what 's with all the concern about hurting the feelings of the developers ? ! What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taking any of this personally . It should be pretty clear that the reaction from the web design community is directed at Microsofts decision to totally drop the ball on improving their web browser . <p> Were the poor suckers who will be spending the next few years fighting to get our designs to work properly in IE we have every right to whinge and complain if this is the effort they are putting in . <p> Thanks Dave . At least I did n't  have to wait until a family member broke down and got Windows ViRUsta to see what theyd do with IE. I guess there 's always time for them to fix it ( or screw it up more ) . <p> Looks like IE is playing catch-up in the browser world now . Wheres the innovation ? Wheres the support for items that other browsers , and OSs , are already doing ? Stop talking about tabs and more RSS stuff , that 's old news , how about some more standards compliance ? <p> And Dave , wheres the article on Deer Park Alpha 2 ( note @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it has some enormously cool features like multicolumn support ( use -moz-column-count and -moz-column-gap ) , built-in svg support , content-counter , : only-child I could go on full quotes support call me jelous but IE7 is getting way to much attention . ; - ) <p> I would n't be as concerned about the lack of CSS improvements if IE 7 was an *alpha* . The fact that its even considered to be a first-round beta is ridiculous , unless of course Microsoft planning on at least 30 or so beta builds ( like a lot of people are doing these days ) . <p> The rendering engine is the very core of the product , and considering how bolted on the tab implementation is ( seriously , you have to *restart* IE to turn tabs on and off ? ) , then there 's little hope left for me . <p> How about the box model ? Does IE 7 calculate background positions before or after padding ? ( IE 6 calculates these before padding , which demonstrates that the box model in IE6 is still fundamentally broken . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a child element is calculated based upon the width of the parent element before the width of the parent element is actually calculated ( i.e. before the padding is taken into account ) ? <p> Any support for max-width and min-width ? The lack of these two make it next to impossible to do decent page layout . <p> I think the new UI is a ploy by microsoft to leverage their monopoly position . People who buy new computers will be forced to use this layout , and get used to it . Then adopting another browser will require them to learn a whole new layout . <p> Yes learning a new layout is easy for us nerds , but hard for most users . <p> " What is going to happen with Mozilla Firefox ? Will he disapear as quickly as he conquered the web ? " Well , like a friend said the other day after giving Opera a spin .. " I had to go back to Firefox because I missed my extensions so much " The question is , just because IE has begun to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Also do n't  forget all those people with WIN2K who wont get this new IE7 <p> " Web developers have expressed some frustration with certain peculiarities in the behavior of Internet Explorer 6 , especially in the areas of standards support . Application developers also want to take advantage of new capabilities of the Web but have been required to develop everything from the ground up to do so . <p> " In Internet Explorer 7 beta 1 , the browser architecture has been reengineered to address compatibility and will offer additional support for popular standards . <p> " CSS is a widely used standard for creating Web pages . Internet Explorer 7 is prioritizing compliance to CSS standards by first implementing the features that developers have said are most important to them . As a result , in Internet Explorer 7 beta 1 Microsoft has addressed some of the major inconsistencies that can cause Web developers problems producing rich , interactive Web pages . The work Microsoft has done includes fixing some positioning and layout issues related to the way Internet Explorer 6 handles div tags . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LONG ... and LONG ... . ) The final release of Internet Explorer 7 will focus on improving the developer experience by reducing the time needed for developing and testing on different browsers . " <p> I had commented over on my site about how the " What 's New " document seems rather non-committal in the CSS realm , but that last sentence above actually offers something approaching a measurable goal . Agreed , the accent is on " approaching . " ( How much less time ? how would you measure it ? " Discuss . " ) I have yet to see anything about specific , measurable commitments regarding CSS1 and CSS2.1 but , even so , its good to see in print . <p> PNG-24 transparency support in IE7 beta or is it png-8 semi-transparency ? ? But again the IE proprietary alpha filter eg will keep on be needed for IE5.x -IE6 . With IE comments to specify the first set of rules for IE6.x or lower . So we should wrap them in the IE ( specify lower than IE7 ) comments and thus benefit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ filters . <p> Seperating the code for IE5.x and IE6.x , IE7.x and up with IE comments and importing them so they can be deleted if in the future no need for them , import styles for IE5.x Mac supporting too png and PNG-supporting modern browsers and excluding again IE 5. x and IE6.x with html&gt;body <p> The entire code could not be posted here . No worry , an e-mail can do wonders . <p> My definite proposal to seperate the IE5.x and IE6 hacks for the PNGs with transparency channel and IE7 and up where it got fixed . Asuming our seperate css files are residing in a map css and our images in a map named images . note that the IE comments is like real HTML comments wrapped around but that did not get posted but this to get a general idea . The whole explanation I gladly refer too http : **37;1369;TOOLONG <p> Also one more note : eg IE4 WIN does support png-8 but for any design reasons we need transparency we can emulate transparency with a transparent checkered pattern gif , there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comments thus validation errors can not be hidden from the W3C validator . The main issue is that we want to have transparency . <p> So for eg IE4 ( if need to support it ) could do this , in some occasions . Make a transparent gif checker pattern where 1px is transparent , the other pixel next to it a color . <p> Also to avoid that IE5 or up will apply this code . you have to play with specifity . And put the IE conditionals last . So the rules in your normal stylesheet specific for IE4 and also seen by IE5.x and up is overwritten by the rules in the IE conditional comments . <p> First extract the **25;1408;TOOLONG file using something like winrar . Then go to the folder you just extracted and delete the file SHLWAPI.DLL . Then open notepad and just save a blank file in notepad as IEXPLORE.exe.local . Then you will be able to run the iexplore.exe . <p> /* put IE5 Mac styles after , if need to emulate transparent image for IE4 , so when IE5 Mac imports @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .. /images/png-24transp.png ) will be used for IE5 Mac because it is overwritten */ <p> Glad MS are making the effort and everything , albeit a tad late , but even when they say they 're doing things they 're still not . Take the : hover pseudo-class for example , in the blog they quote it as being fixed for all elements in the Beta 1 . But its not . A simple test will reveal that you still ca n't use : hover on anything but anchors . Aaargh . <p> On the blog , they list the bug fixes in beta 1 followed by the support fixes . It also claims they added selector support , which also does n't  work . <p> The comment " Though you wo n't see ( most of ) these until Beta 2 " is referring to the statement " In IE7 , we will fix as many of the worst bugs that web developers hit as we can " , not the list below . Everything listed below is what 's supposed to be supported in beta 1 . <p> " I want to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fully complies with the appropriate web standards , in particular CSS 2 ( 2.1 , once its been Recommended ) . " <p> that worry me . If they 're not even aware that 2.1 IS the recommended specification , how are we even supposed to rely on the developers to produce a browser that 's even remotely capable of rendering standards compliant pages correctly ? <p> It is for this reason , I believe , that support for " display:inline-block " was actually *removed* from Firefox " since it was officially " Recommended " yet . ( Ludicrous , of course , since its been in IE for ages ) <p> Hopefully the list distributed on the IEBlog will actually be completed , so we can stop worrying so much about IE support and more on simply designing . Its excellent that the IE team have started working with WaSP again to improve their browser . <p> It appears that the W3C have moved 2.1s status back to " Working Draft " , maybe in part to give the IE team less things to implement and bring out a working browser @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things in the list on the blog are things that will be fixed for IE7 , or at least beta 2 , and not things that were fixed for beta 1 . So IE7 really is just IE6 with tabbed browsing . And it looks worse . <p> Why are people defending this project ? It does n't  make any sense that so many people are having to put so much time and effort into something that should have worked correctly a long time ago . <p> I do n't  understand why , when the W3C standards are very clearly laid out , and everyone here knows what they mean , the IE team still cant make their browser obey the rules . <p> Initially I thought that the shortcomings of IE were to do with a misinterpretation of the rules - I assumed the box-model mistake was just a cock-up , and transparency in . png files was something new that would be included as soon as possible . <p> It seems IE7 now does come with alpha-channel support for PNGs , but what about everything else ? <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so I cant verify . Regardless , a lot of people first learned about it from Joes article in 2003 . If someone else discovered it prior to that point , they sure kept quiet about it . <p> Well let 's hope Team IE gets the whole standards issue sorted out in IE7 . I was just making a new blog layout and well it went wrong a the first grpahic is used , in FF it just diplayed it perfectly but in IE i apparantly ca n't really count pixels so there immediatly is a difference of 1 px in my display : S <p> Theyve also said they 're not aiming for Acid2 fixes which does n't  really worry me all that much . <p> If you were Microsoft , what would you rather do ? Fix issues that CSS developers have every day , or fix issues from a single test which is often held up by CSS proponents as a " holy grail " of compatibility sorts and gain their &lt;3 , but ignore more pressing issues like disappearing floats and text jogs and the like ? <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is still not working in IE7 . The list of bugs in IE7 Beta is endless , and there are some new ones too ( filters not working like they should etc , and forget also future compliance with CSS 3 , like multiple columns or 2 background pics , tables etc . ) This is good for web designers , since we will still be able to bill higher prices to our customers that want cross browsers solutions ! Thank you MS for helping us make more money ! <p> It just blows my mind that Microsoft , a company that certainly does n't  have budget problems , cant keep up with anyone else . It seems like everything they do is based on crap that has been around for years . Everything they make is barely better than what 's already outdated . Windows Live ? Tabbed Browsing ? Alpha support ? <p> Seperating the code for IE5.x and IE6.x , IE7.x and up with IE comments and importing them so they can be deleted if in the future no need for them , import styles for IE5.x @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again IE 5. x and IE6.x with html&gt;body <p> The entire code could not be posted here . No worry , an e-mail can do wonders . <p> I would be ecstatic to find a decent XHTML/CSS editor that supports some semblance of AJAX development . I am a developer with a goal of producing standards-based XHTML/CSS , but my experience has been that the big webpage editors do n't  support that goal very well . If I could have that , along with a little AJAX support , I 'd be as happy as a lark . My fear , though , is that DreamWeaver will never support AJAX well because it is effectively completing techology with Flash . <p> On the blog , they list the bug fixes in beta 1 followed by the support fixes .

@@99593505 @3793505/ <p> I was about to Flickr this and leave it at that , but then I remembered oh yeah , I 've got a web site . <p> This mornings mail brought me a renewal notice from my domain registrar . The currently-dormant personal nameplate domain Ive been sitting on is coming up for renewal at the end of the year , so they 're really staying on top of it by sending me the renewal notice during the summer . <p> Except , wait . Domain Registry of Canada ? That does n't  seem right . This domain was registered with a US-based company . I do n't  have any business with Canadian registrars that I 'm aware of . <p> Ive been hearing about this tactic for years , and received one or two of these in the past , so it did n't  take long to conclude that , yes , this is a scam . Even though the notice is deceptively formatted to look like an invoice , the wording tells me exactly what 's going on ( emphasis mine ) : <p> " When you switch today to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the time to transfer and renew your name " <p> " Domain name holders are not obligated to renew their domain name with their current Registrar or with the Domain Registry of Canada . Review our prices and decide for yourself . You are under no obligation to pay the amounts stated below , unless you accept this offer . " <p> Theyve obviously spent time honing their text so this practice may not run afoul of the relevant consumer protection laws . The company has been at it for years in other countries with multiple legal proceedings in the past , so they 've had the time to get it right . It may be that the notice I received is technically legal . <p> But I still think they 're scum , and this is a scam-like practice whether its legal or not . They 're obviously counting on people to focus on the invoice and ignore the text . ( Web users skim , they do n't  read , right ? ) With an official-sounding name like " Domain Registry of Canada " its easy to understand how their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in fact the one they originally registered with ( do you actually consider your domain registrar more than once a year ? ) . If someone web-savvy like myself has to seriously think about what 's going on here , how many average small business owners or office administrators do they sucker annually ? <p> There may be legal recourse here , but I 'm willing to bet that if they 're still doing it after all these years , theyve managed to figure out how to avoid prosecution . So there 's not much to be done aside from wasting 50 cents on a stamp for their return envelope to return them a personal F U. Ineffective and useless to be sure , but if I can kill at least a fraction of a second of their anticipation of taking in another sucker while they open the envelope , to me that 's good enough . <p> I 've received these myself ( from Domain Registry of America ) , as have several of my clients . In a few cases , some of them have even transfered their registrations - and its no easy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office , waiting on hold forever , getting an unlock code , and then waiting weeks to complete the transfer - not to mention all the money lost in the process ) . Lame . Totally lame . <p> I got one last year and was puzzled by it , thinking I needed to renew . Of course , I get all my renewal notices via email . After some consideration , I tossed it . When it came around this year , it got tossed without a second thought . Sending the postage-paid envelope back , though , wouldve been fun . <p> I receive at least one of these letters a year for each of the domains I have registered . And they look and sound almost identical to what you have posted . They usually come from " Liberty Names of America " , though I would n't be surprised if " Domain Registry of Canada " turned out to be a sister company , both owned by some parent organization . Notably the rates they charge are usually 3-4 times the rate I pay through my host @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ duped into this " not sure what happened . I guess there DNS is now registered through " Domain Registry of Canada " . I should ask them how the service has been " might be funny if it was n't a low ball scam . <p> I am almost certain these guys get your personal information from the DNS information that is publicly available . I 've received several letters from them but they all stopped when I no longer had my mailing address linked to my domain name . <p> My friends run a web hosting / domain registration company and they 've had to rescue a few companies whove been successfully scammed by these guys and one more similar outfit you 'd really only need to have about a 0.1% success rate to make some cash if you spammed every domain owner in Canada <p> I actually get Domain Registry of America letters fairly frequently here in the UK , having seen them a bunch of times I know they 're a scam . However , I 've had two clients receive the letters and fall for it and attempt to renew their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seem to send these letters to the Registrants address and not the domain admin address which would be me ! I 'm sure its intentional in the hope that whoever receives it just presumes that its required ! <p> I just got one of those yesterday ! I honestly had to read through it three times before I was certain it was a scam . Thanks for your post Dave , I 'm glad I 'm not the only one who is web savvy but still nearly duped by their clever wording . Stupid scammers . <p> Something similar has been happening for years with yellow pages ads . We got them all the time at the company I used to have . Those were even worse in that the fact that they were a solicitation instead of a legitimate invoice was not so apparent . We surmised that at a lot of companies , the accounts payable department would just blindly cut a check . <p> At the company where I worked 20 years ago , we 'd get " Renewal Notices " for our Yellow Pages listing from two or three shady @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be signing up for an ad in their lesser-known phone directory . <p> The sad thing is that lots of businesses undoubtedly pay them because they look just like invoices , and the AP department is n't going to investigate too much for a $20 charge . <p> The ones I get all the time though are the ones from " paypal " . You know , the ones that ask you to sign in at some site where paypal is the subdomain rather than the domain . Luckily for me Im not one of the web users who simply skims . <p> Another one we 've seen in South Africa , is a phone call from a call center like this : " We have an application for company.com ( instead of your own company.co.za ) that will go through in two days . To prevent this domain being registered , you will have to register with us before tomorrow . We require a TEN YEAR ( emphasis mine ) registration with payment up front . " <p> Check back a week later , and still no registration records for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up and up the levels to talk to superiors , managers , etc if you have time to waste their time and run up their phone bill . <p> To dave above me , it is at least scam-ish and bordering on legality , when they imply that you are already a customer of theirs who simply needs to do a renewal . GEICO , for example , does n't  make commercials that act like I 'm already a customer who just needs to renew my coverage . They make commercials that act as though I 'm a Progressive customer who needs to switch because I like talking geckos . <p> Anyway . On a different note , a few years ago when I got a Domain Registry of America letter ( of course it has happened several other times ) , I called them and asked why I would want to increase my monthly bill by tenfold ( I believe it actually was tenfold , at the time ) over what I was paying my current registrar . They stammered a bit , and admitted that I would n't be gaining anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I must say . <p> I 've received these every year for almost a decade , and they have most definitely gotten scammier and more invoice-like over time . At my last job , the financial assistants asked me several times ( once or twice a year ) whether they were legitimate bills , and every time I had to dig to find the " This is not a bill " phrasing . <p> Its not just a common practice for domain registrations , though . I recently bought a house , and since then have received half a dozen letters that seem to be important documents relating to my mortgage or home insurance . When I look closer , however , I see that they have no affiliation with either my lender or insurance provider and that they are simply trying to scam me into using an additional , unnecessary service . <p> Its shameful , obnoxious , and I 'm sure more than a fair share of its success hinges on people being too busy or lazy to notice . <p> I actually got one the other day ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Domain Registry of America " instead exactly the same deal though , including the layout of the thing . <p> And they want 2.5 times as much as I 'm paying right now per year ! Yeah , that sounds like a solid deal <p> I can understand how some people get fooled by the " protect your online identity " fearmongering crap to make them give up their CC info . <p> " This notice is not a bill " it says , but they sure go out of their way to make it look like an invoice . <p> On a related notice , a few years ago I got some email spam scam where someone wanted to sell me " my " domain I have a . net domain , and the email said they had registered the same . com name and now wanted me to pay through the nose for it . <p> I had a look at the whois info , and saw that it was actually unregistered . So I registered it on the spot and sent them a reply thanking them for telling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got a reply <p> I got one of these one time , but it was even more generic than the one you received , and the wording was more tricky . If it was n't for the fact that it was at the wrong time of year , an " invoice " for more money than my original agreement , and a PAPER invoice , I might have given it more than a second thought . <p> I agree that small business owners could easily be tricked by this sort of scam . Any of my clients usually forward anything related to their service to me . If they got one of these things , they might really hurt themselves . <p> What really gets me about these guys is that they use the exact same style ( color , and other markings ) as the Government of Canada uses for its mailings ( Tax filing , GST filing , etc ) . My wife who looks after all our finances actually paid one of these for me thinking that it was a Government invoice . The guys are BASTARDS . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the Registry of Canada ( I 'm in America ) . I 'm not even sure who they 're from because I know exactly who all of my domains are registered with so these go right in the trash . This a really cruddy tactic though . <p> I 've had clients that have been duped into this . All of a sudden their DNS is different and when it comes time for us to do their website , we have to upcharge for the time we blow trying to get the domain name into honest hands . <p> This is probably 1st place right above the vehicle warranty renewal scam Ive been getting mail and phone calls about lately . That one really gets on my nerves . <p> I get a few of these from the Domain Registry Of America every year . The first time I was worried that I screwed up somewhere and actually did owe them money , but after careful examination I learned it was a scam . <p> Now every letter I get from them provides quality time with the paper shredder . <p> This happened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mail and then he advertently fell for it and was forced to renew his domain for 10 years .. it was a shame they never consulted with me during the transfer request emails etc as happen during domain transfers , is there not a law against this , because it really is fraud ! <p> An old client of mine got one of these notices . They thought this was their renewal notice . Well before they asked they had gone through the process . After many arguments they ended up getting control of their domain back but ended up losing a year of payment . Scamers . <p> My wife responded to one of these from a company called Liberty Names of America , she thought she was being helpful by taking care of this for me . When I found out , I explained that the company was actually trying to steal business from my current registrar . She was so angry that she put a stop payment order on the check despite the fee . <p> I got an email from them about releasing the lock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have n't heard from them since . <p> Yes , I 've received these before . For my websites , my brothers websites ( which I managed for while and the bills were sent to my parents house , who questioned me about it ) , and for my company . <p> The first time I received one , I did have to do a double , triple , and quadruple take . Though , as you pointed out , a quick read through points to the " disclaim " crap they put in to try and avoid legal proceedings . <p> Personally , I 'd like to send them one of my own mails like this and hope I could get their own website transferred to my name so I could subsequently screw with it . <p> I get SO many of these its sick . No to mention we field several of these a month for our clients domains as well . Domains are big business and scams like these can end up costing organizations lots for money if they are not careful . <p> I have received *many* of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . Since I 'm located in the Netherlands , I have to assume that they 're spending quite a bit of money on transatlantic postage , and I had always thought that nobody would fall for this scheme but judging from the other comments , I 'm probably mistaken <p> I 've gotten several of these type of scams in the past . And they infuriate me . They 're often designed to look like a bill , hoping you 'll just glance at it and put a check in the mail . But I have all my domains through one registrar , and I deal with them only via the web , so any snail-mail bill for web services is suspect from the start . <p> Our web hosting customers are often confused by these letters and we receive regular support requests about them . The domain name business has some mighty shady characters and this company is certainly among the most grotesque . <p> Do n't  get mad - get even ! When I receive disceptive solicitations like these , I shred the contents and return it to them . Better yet , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , use it . It will cost them a few cents and no doubt , some aggravation when they spill the returned contents all over their desk . <p> they work on the principle that a $39.97 invoice for domain renewal is just going to get paid without question by the accounts department . seems to me that the internic people are selling theses lists how do I know - well I have started misspelling my name in the Domain registry and that is the only place that that misspelling appears - This is what I do Take the capital One CC pre-approved application and put that in the Domain reg envelope - yep you get the idea <p> wow ive not heard of anything like this before - that 's unbelievable that some people would earn money by deception . like you mentioned if it made you think twice many other people with a lesser background have no chance . they have obviously improved the look , feel and text over the years - i agree with you , scum - all of them . <p> regards . <p> DS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ someone clearly trying to earn money if not by deception , then at least by attempting to steal some unearned PageRank . No link for you . <p> Every time the domain name on my volunteer site comes up for renewal , we get these . Fortunately our Bookkeeper has always questioned it , and I tell her to ignore it . The first time however , I really had to read the fine print . <p> We got one yesterday . It looks very authentic . And I love the part where they offer you a deal if you review for more than one year ( discount for 2 years ; discount for 3 years - but it still is twice as much as I pay in a year ) . But luckily I knew that I had my domain registration with my hosting company . Its in the garbage now but after reading all these comments and the reach of this scam , I 'm thinking I 'll pull it out and send it on to the Better Business Bureau . At least it might help to raise awareness . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family website domain ( must have been back around mid 90s , I received a renewal request via snail mail . Filled it out and next thing I knew , our domain was transferred . <p> Ive since learned my lesson and I keep strict track of all my domains and where they are registered and try to keep them all in the same place ! <p> I get these all the time from " Domain Registry of America " Theyre 100% scum and these types of " businesses " should be illegal tossing the owners in jail . <p> Speaking of scams . A friend just setup their online presence using Yahoo Business . A couple weeks after getting their site setup , they got an actual phone call from " their website support " . They wanted to sell them an XML sitemap for $500 and theyd toss in an HTML sitemap for just another $500 . <p> Yahoo automatically generates and submits an XML sitemap to the search engines for the business hosting . <p> I have only two things to say about this kind of scam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! And 2 . I 'm glad I happened upon this article . Because I have my own domain through yahooAnd I would be so pod and down in the dumps if I lost my domain name . <p> Unfortunately we have seen this " practice " several times . One of our clients almost fell for it but thankfully emailed us first . <p> We have started telling our new clients about this scam right away as they seem to target freshly registered domains - even when they are nowhere near expiry . <p> The letters we receive are all from " The Domain Registry of America " - a quick Google for the same will show interesting results ! Post your dead trees back to these guys and tell your clients about it if you register domains for them . <p> I actually found this post while googling for fake renewal notices . Good . Ive been receiving this so called renewal notice/invoice for sometime now , as every time i register a new domain , so clearly i too think anon registrations are the way to go .. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about two month ago I received an email from this reseller that my domains expires and need renewal by different " recommended hosting service " . I checked the ip of the email and found out that the emailadress was was faked and not sent by the domain reseller . When you receive mails or letters from unknown companies , often they want your best . <p> I own 3 domains and received a similar letter . I was puzzled as to how my domain could have been purchased by another company as I still owned it . I call Y ! by whom I originally registered the domain and who was currently hosting the domain and inquired regarding the letter . Y ! cleared up the confusion reiterating that I still owned the domain and that re-registration could be completed through Y ! . The letter , for all intents and purposes , stated that it now owned my domain and that I had to purchase my domain from them . The company who sent the letter will be referred to the Better Business Bureau as potentially fraudulent and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this company to desist from perpetrating business practices that should be labelled as scams . <p> I get them too . I 'd recommend complaining to Industry Canada since when I looked into it , they where a federally registered company . My understanding is that in Canada it is against the law to resemble a government department or have the appearance of doing so , but there would need to be a good body of complaints against these guys for Industry Canada to act . <p> I received these all the time . For my clients I include the domain name with their webmaster fees . I also only use my address for the registrants information . The domain is still registrars in their name and the name of their company . For those clients who prefer to have their own address used , I charge them the extra fee to have it register by proxy . When I explain why I do this they have all let me just use my address . So far I have never had anything sent to me in the mail for my clients @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ based in Australia and get a few of these each year in my letterbox from the Domain Registry of America . The first time I got one I had to do a double take I have to admit , they nearly got me ! The only reason they did n't  was because I did n't  think it was anywhere near time for renewal ! 
@@99593506 @3793506/ <p> Why coding and design do n't  mix , and news of two new Zen Garden submissions . <p> Time for a breather , I think . <p> The focus on browsers lately has been good for thinking about what 's important for users and developers , and what lies ahead , but you can only prattle on so much before realizing its just an intellectual discussion . While the technology may change , its only a means to an end and what really counts is how you use it . Moving on to another subject near and dear to my heart : design . <p> I recently did an interview for zlog in which I stated that coding is counterintuitive to a designer ( and I just noticed that Ronan has a new one posted with Ben Hammersley I 'm in good company . ) <p> Scott Steffens posted a thoughtful response to the interview that bears consideration . He argues that the designer is the best person to plan the layout and interaction , and one of his strongest points is that a designer who does n't  know the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ achieve . <p> I believe to a certain degree , he s right . When designing for a technological medium , you have to consider the technology and make sure you understand its strengths and limitations . <p> This holds true for any medium if you paint a picture with oil paints , you study concepts like fat over lean and get used to working with malleable paint that does n't  dry for days or weeks . If you do n't  know any of this going in , and all you 've used in the past are watercolours , you will quickly get frustrated in your efforts . The result wont be pretty . Different methods of creation have their strengths and weaknesses , you need to know what they are before you can use them effectively . <p> But the problem , jumping back to the coding focus , is when you start adapting your layout to fit a design you know you can code . The tools are getting in the way of your creativity . <p> Consider oldschool table layouts . The laborious process of chopping up images @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ row and adding up colspans and the like is a very mechanical process . Tools are available that allow a designer to accomplish almost anything they need to with these methods . A good handle on the code will only improve this process , and while there are surely layouts that can not be handled effectively through these automatic tools , for many purposes they get you 80 or 90% of the way there . <p> The remaining few percent is what will distinguish a good web designer from a pixeljockey . The former understands relative font sizing , window scaling , and clean code . The latter cares more about the visuals and can satisfactorily call their work complete without ever having to touch that last 10% . Some will say that 's good enough , others will deride them for leaving the job unfinished . <p> Currently no such choice exists for CSSbased design . Which , some argue , is a good thing because it prevents those who fall into the latter category from mucking with it too seriously . Which , I 'd argue , is precisely why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show the latter category what they 're missing out on . <p> Having a visual CSS editor is n't going to make the world a better place . It will enable people who code improperly to continue doing so . It still wo n't make better designers of the coders using CSS now . But it will make life easier for people who wish to have it both ways . <p> And speaking of design , do not miss the two excellent new Zen Garden submissions : " Wrapped in Burlap " by John Simons and " What Lies Beneath " by Micheal Pick . You may remember Mikes previous submission , " Dead or Alive " . These two designs are phenomenally creative examples of how radically different the same designer can approach the same problem . There 's some incredible talent in this one , and if you 're in the New York area , do peruse his portfolio . 30454 @qwx890454 <p> You know , I 'm all for designers NOT getting their hands dirty with the CSS . Why ? well , I 'm a terrible designer ( e.g. : my personal site @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of experience in taking a designers cherished Illustrator/Photoshop file and recreating faithfully in the web medium . So for purely selfish reasons , in that I get paid to do such things , I do n't  want designers to do that part . On the other hand , having worked with designers with little-to-no web-design experience , it can be frustrating to try and explain to them the rules , or paradigms of the web , as a medium . What 's more important , it seems to be , is that a designer understand the medium , rather than know how to translate it out . I do n't  expect a print designer to know the intricate details of printing - that 's for the printer to know . I do expect a designer to know how color-choice might affect that , etc . Same thing for the web . The other side of it is specialization : the web is now a mature enough platform that people can specialize in what they do . Each specialist needs to know a fair amount about the platform they work in , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> I totally agree w/ Stv . However , the sad thing is that some ( or a lot , depending on who you speak to ) employers demand a designer/coder package in one person , not understanding it takes two different schools of thought of each . As this a comic illustrates . I think some people can pull it off just fine ( Dave here being one of them ) , but I think the best case is to have designers design , and coders code . <p> Andy , thanks ! Glad to hear you 're enjoying it , and I 'm sure I speak for the submitters as well . <p> Eric , I 'd beg to differ . The logic behind creating a chopped-up table from Fireworks is linear . You divide the design into rows and columns , and chop away . Software can handle that . If you 've ever tried to build a more complex CSS layout , things like tiling background images , overlays , and other assorted niceties are anything but linear . It takes a human brain to see a design and decide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just do n't  see software duplicating that process . I may be wrong . I 'd like to be wrong . But well see . <p> Steve , I work with the same kind of designers . Conversely , I 'm a web designer that only deals with print from time to time , so I try to keep that in perspective when I talk to them . I understand the limitations of spot and process colour , but I sure do n't  know all the technical bits and reasons why things have to happen the way they do . I just assume print designers are coming at the web with the same sketchy knowledge . I try to be as receptive to suggestion as possible when printing , since its assumed the people I deal with know more than I do . The hope is that theyd extend me the same courtesy . Sometimes it happens , other times . well . here 's how it goes when that happens . <p> I do n't  expect a print designer to know the intricate details of printing - that 's for the printer to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite a bit about the printing process , even though the same divide exists between printers and designers as exists between coders and designers . Print is one of those things where there 's a million tricks - if you know them , you 're golden , but missing one can cost you in time and money - I know guys who have a solid five years print experience and they 're considered beginners . <p> I 'm like Dave , where I 've ended up doing more web than print . I love print , but the opportunities have n't come up as much , and its a tough market to crack for the reason I mention above . <p> I think its a Very Good Thing to know the limits of your medium , no matter what it is - the trick is to forget the limits for the creative process and remember them for the execution process . <p> i just wanted to say that this is both a great read and a terrific website you have here , dave ! was just checking out the latest css-designs on the Zen Garden and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guyz have created .. wow . <p> i usually do n't  comment on a whim , but i really wanted to simply drop a quick line . <p> I am increasingly amazed and impressed at the talent shown through CSS Zen Garden in both design and artwork . For someone like me , who would love to design and create such a page , lacks the necessary skills ( and talent : ) ) in creating the graphics for the design . I liked to say well done to all those artists that submitted designs and that I am slightly envious of their talent and skill . <p> THere is no reason someone could n't make a WYSIWYG page editor that used only CSS . In fact it would probably be easier than writing an editor to make pages the old way . However , its not about designing/coding pages , its about designing/coding sites . Sites are no longer just directories full of pages , they are conherent applications and effective use of CSS is a big part of it . <p> the sad thing is that some employers demand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ takes two different schools of thought of each . <p> A candidate that excells in both disciplines will obviously provide the employer with the best designer one who can design for the medium . Another design field , landscape architecture , mixes design with botany , two otherwise unrelated fields . I would n't hire someone to design a city park unless they were experts in design AND plants . Just like the printing comment I would question the credentials of a print designer who does n't  know the intricate details of printing . <p> But in this subject , as with most things , its a matter of degrees . 30455 @qwx890455 30451 @qwx890451 <p> You are reading " Coding vs .

@@99593507 @3793507/ <p> There 's a great new blog over at MSDN from Jensen Harris , a member of the Microsoft Office user experience team . In case you have n't seen the screenshots floating around , the forthcoming Office 12 from Microsoft is undergoing a pretty significant UI update , so reading one of the people working on it has been fascinating . <p> Jensen is writing in detail about historical UI decisions , evolution of the office suite , and some user testing results that might surprise you . A lot of their findings are definitely not Office-specific . Some notable recent posts : <p> In which Office visibly exposes shortcut keys when you hold down alt . Great idea ; I believe Windows has been using a similar concept with underlined shortcut keys in menus for years , but this is a much more obvious way of emphasizing the connection between shortcut and function . Now if one of the major browsers were to get accesskeys working this way <p> In which Offices new Ribbon toolbar tried and failed as a left-to-right layout in order of descending importance . Turns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This is my favourite post in the bunch so far . <p> In which Office implements a mini formatting menu on selection . I love the idea , but from the comments on the post it sounds like its tightly saddled to text formatting only . A shame , I 'd have expected it to be modal , taking its specific palette of tools at any given time from the Ribbon toolbar . <p> I have to admit , " Microsoft " and " Great UI " are two phrases that do n't  often appear together in my mind , but credit where its due . The Office team seems to be doing a bang-up job on the next release . <p> One thing I miss about Lotus products is the InfoBox as I recall , Lotus got a patent on it , and I 've wondered if that 's stymied some Office UI innovations . It came to mind when you mentioned your thoughts on the MiniBar . <p> I am very excited to see Microsoft introduce new UI components and interaction methods . There have been few , if any , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so . So far , Office 12 looks promising . <p> As I have written about Vista , Microsoft seems to be intent on making everything shiny and using predefined bright colors . Both of which have a tendency to be distracting . In an application focused on content creation , the UI should be as neutral and unobtrusive as possible . Color being subjective , using non-user-configurable bold colors to indicate modes and selections has the potential to put off users . Working in an environment for an extended period of time with colors that the user finds objectionable can make for an unpleasant experience . Additionally , white text on yellow and text over shiny things , as seen in several of the screenshots and videos , is not particularly readable . <p> As for the KeyTips : were underlines really that bad ? The KeyTips popup over the buttons text in some cases , and over the icons , in others . Either way , information is obscured , which is n't favorable , even if momentarily . <p> Oh my gosh ! Looks like office is taking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small step forwards it took with Office XP . The new toolbar looks far too bloated with far too many presentational options , and the few semantic options in there are virtually hidden . <p> I was really hoping document authoring tools ( particularly Word ) would learn the very concepts that web developers are pushing for HTML+CSS : separation of presentation from the structure , semantics and content . <p> IMHO , MS Word needs to remove every single presentational option ( bold , italic , fonts , etc ) from the toolbars and focus on provinding truly semantic and structure based templates . Of course the user should be able to style such templates , but that should be kept completely separate from the content authoring . The new MiniBar disgusts me for this very reason , since it places such options right in the middle of the content . <p> I 've seen lots of negative comments from programmers and designers . I 'm a programmer myself , but let 's not forget Office is not for programmers . Its for *everybody* . Separating semantics from presentation ? What user @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the blog says , they 've been doing lots of user testing , and they seem to be headed in the right direction . <p> I *personally* cant wait to try something different from the labyrinth of menus of current applications . <p> To Ivan : I quote Rick Scott who posted a comment in the MiniBar blog entry : " I disagree . If its done JUST right , it can have a great penetration , at the expense of further learning . <p> For instance , if the MiniBar had a button that said " Make Heading " that automatically Bolded , Centered and increased font size by 1 ( or changed it to a certain font size like 14 or 18 ) , it would be very learnable . The customization part would be a simple property page on what " make heading " means that intermediate users could play with . Basically like the H1 tag in HTMLits pre-set to look like a huge heading . " <p> For some time now the menu model has become unwieldy , and there are way too many toolbars to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ users well , but I do think we can benefit from a new interface . I 'm not sure the ribbon interface is the best new possibility , but am curious to see it in action . <p> I just felt I needed to add a thought - I really really hope they improve the export to HTML mode , adopt a standardized document format and especially that they fix the very annoying bugs when working tightly with Excel and working with lots of data - doing physics lab reports and having to format the graphs and tables is a night-mare . <p> For example : I copy-paste a graph from excel - only one line-height of its hight is visible Annoying . So I rightclick and choose layout . Boxed , center . It centers on top of the page outside the paper margin . I move it down - but I have a table on the same page . Alright , think Word , I 'll position it INSIDE a TABLE CELL ! This of course makes the whole table 2x with width of the paper and also makes it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be . <p> Or I paste as a workbook instead of an image into word . I double click and edit something , e.g. an error-bar on a graph . Doubleclick outside the graph Suddenly with width of the graph is the same as my screen resolution - 1240 px . Nice ! <p> Oh And another thing ( on this site ) - the comment preview button - your sidebar comes up when I press preview , so that the text in the blog entry flows over it . <p> I have no doubt the new Office will be the hottest microsoft product until the releaes of vista.I cant wait to play with some of the new features her blog says are coming . She has done a great job with her blog and I hope she keeps up the great work . 30455 @qwx890455 30451 @qwx890451 <p> You are reading " Office UI " , an entry posted on 14 October , 2005 , to the Script collection .

If you have applied Chalkwork icons to situations that you think might be unique , I 'd certainly be interested in hearing about them . <p> After I 've bought/downloaded them may I edit these icons for my own use ? <p> Provided you stick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same license ( personal use ) or do n't  redistribute your edits ( commercial use ) , Im of the opinion that once you 've paid for the icons they 're yours for the editing . For example , you may wish to change certain colours to work better with your sites palette , which is allowable . <p> I would caution against re-sizing the bitmap versions in particular however , as the existing icons have been meticulously designed to fit within the pixel grid at the sizes they come in . Any scaling up or down will lead to less overall clarity . ( If you need different sizes than what is available , please get in touch . ) <p> Vector icons are much more suitable for editing of course , so if you intend to heavily edit them , you should consider buying the vector versions . <p> What is the difference between the various file formats ? <h> Bitmap Formats <p> Four of the formats provided are saved as lossless files , so quality is guaranteed . Two ( BMP and GIF ) do not support the colour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and may be dropped entirely in future releases .. <p> PNG Portable Network Graphics is considered the preferred bitmap format for Chalkwork customers to work with . As an open format that uses lossless compression and an alpha transparency channel , the PNG versions are high-quality icons that are readable by almost any graphical editor or web browser . PNG on Wikipedia <p> TIF Tagged Image File Format is another high-quality bitmap format that uses lossless compression and an alpha transparency channel . TIF is a more mature format , and perfect for legacy applications . TIF on Wikipedia <p> ICO Windows icon file format is the native file format created for Microsoft Windows , and mainly used by Windows applications and the operating system itself . ICO on Wikipedia <p> ICNS Mac OS icon file format is the native file format used for Apple 's Mac OS , and mainly used by OS X applications and the operating system itself . Does not support the 24x24 bitmap size . ICNS on Wikipedia <p> BMP Bitmap format is a legacy format used by older applications and operating systems . Lack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supports up to 32 bit colour depth so no colour information is lost when saving . However , the 1 bit alpha channel does n't allow for smooth anti-aliased edges , so the icon files still tend to be of lower quality than the previous four formats . BMP on Wikipedia <p> GIF Graphics Interchange Format is a common format used by web browsers and most graphical software . 8 bit colour depth means colour information is lost when saving , and the 1 bit alpha channel does n't allow for smooth anti-aliased edges which makes for lower quality icons . Provided for your use in quick mockups , but not really intended for final use due to image degradation during the saving process . GIF on Wikipedia <h> Vector Formats <p> Some of these formats are delivered to you as single files with each icon on its own layer , while others contain one icon per file across multiple files . <p> AI Adobe Illustrator ( single layered file ) The native file format of Adobe Illustrator , readable by a handful of other vector drawing applications .

SVG on Wikipedia <p> I notice you update the existing sets periodically ; am I entitled to a free update when this happens ? <p> Since the initial launch of the very first Chalkwork set in early 2007 , I 've continued making changes as I 've added new icons . Basic has seen 2 major revisions and a few minor updates , for example , while Flags remains untouched from its initial launch profile . The earlier sets saw the most transition as I was working out my longer term strategy for new ones , but now that I 'm 7 sets in I think its safe to say things are mostly worked out . I do n't  see anymore updates to the existing sets , instead I expect completely new sets to be released @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then history says I 'll probably continue making them available to existing customers at no extra cost . The exception is the addition of new sets to the Chalkwork Collection , those will be made available at a discounted rate . <p> Will you create custom Chalkwork icons for me ? <p> Probably not . I 'd rather focus my energy on adding to the publicly available sets . I 'm not opposed to the idea of being commissioned to produce new icons that I 'd then resell as part of the larger Chalkwork family , but the reality is that out of the many inquiries Ive received asking if I can do just that , none have actually happened . Write me if you 're still interested , but just keep in mind that it 's probably more expensive than you think it would be . I 'll explain why after you get in touch . <p> Will you create non-Chalkwork icons for me ? <p> Now that 's something I 'm generally a lot more receptive to . Hop on over to my business site and write me from there . Just keep in mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How many times have they been downloaded ? <p> A little nosy are we ?

@@99593509 @3793509/ <p> If you 've been following Dan Cederholms SimpleQuiz series for any length of time , you 'll be happy to note that his new book Web Standards Solutions is a full-length summary of the best practices that have evolved from it , and more . <p> Web Standards Solutions ( WSS ) is a quick , easy read . Broken into 16 chapters , each one takes no more than 15 or 20 minutes to breeze through . Broken into two parts , the first half of the book analyzes general markup and style best practices , while the second half takes these practices and others and applies them to a real site , simplebits.com . <p> Dan is interested in the theory as well as the practics ; while multiple solutions are presented , he provides the best one along with reasoning why it is the best , and why the others are n't  . Not to say this is a scholarly exercise in pedantry ; writing around some needlessly mind-numbing purist issues that weigh down real-world projects , he presents the tools needed to get the job done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with web standards , this little yellow book is the perfect complement to another little orange book . Think of the latter as the book thatll sell you the why , and the former as the book that will instruct you how . <p> Chapter 9 , for example , talks about minimizing markup , and its the sort of perfectly clear explanation of avoiding classitis and making the most of miminal markup elements that everyone needs to read . Chapter 6 covers basic text formatting markup and style , and in one of the most lucid explanations on the subject Ive yet read , explains once and for all why &lt;strong&gt; should be preferred over &lt;b&gt; . <p> This is n't a design book . WSS discusses the practical approach to using web standards in your work , and provides some visual examples , but the imagery and design skills necessary to create the examples are left for the reader to negotiate using their own experience or another book . Dan discusses how to apply design , not how to design in the first place . If you 're only interested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you 're interested in applying visuals to properly structured and well-built sites using methods that allow for maximum accessibility and save you time , then you need WSS . <p> Some of the chapters are thinner than others ; I found chapter 4 on quotations to be particularly wanting . And the good writing and clarity contained within the covers is unfortunately misrepresented by the grammatically and technically suspect marketing copy on the back cover ; I certainly would n't be buying it on the strength of that alone . <p> Luckily there are plenty of other reasons to buy WSS , and these are minor criticisms of an otherwise excellent guide to making the right decisions and understanding why you made them . 9 out of 10 , which on my scale means you should have it on your desk , no questions asked . 30454 @qwx890454 <p> its not bad , with some good , light-hearted writing . i slightly disagree with some of the solutions - i found myself reading it and constantly scribbling little notes and suggestions in the margin , which i may pass on to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pedants ; ) good stuff indeed , and yesits already on my desk ( well , my scanner lid , to be exact ) <p> Dave makes a key point - its a quick read . This is why I think the book will be an excellent introduction to standards-based design for those only recently embracing the methods . By sticking to a uniform structure , each chapter is both in-depth and quick reference . <p> I 'm sure that many may not agree with all of Dans suggestions , but I think this is another strength . There are several solutions to each problem , and its up to the user to decide which one to employ . I think the last thing Dan would want is for us all to start doing things the same way . Do it semantically , yes . Do it with structured , sensible CSS , definitely - but also do it YOUR way . <p> Its about time a good book was released that talks about and focusses on proper use of semantic markup . There are plenty of good CSS books out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Meyers . But I found that there is n't as much emphsis on using correct semantic and structured markup as I think there needs to be . I feel CSS books tend to be aimed more at those who already know the difference between b and strong , p and br , etc where as books like WSS would be more aimed at those just starting to learn XHTML , or for those that need to move away from writing tag soup . <p> I find too many people think about their documents presentationally , rather than structurally and semantically . ( hence , the use of bold , italic , font styles , etc by so many , from the toolbars of common word processors ) . Itd be good if people actually learned and applied correct semantics before they started styling their documents ; then , one day , we may start seeing more accessible , tableless designs on the web . <p> Ill definately be recommending this book to some people I know , and I may even get a copy for myself . : ) <p> I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read it while at the parents house . It was definitely helpfull and presented a few new things to me , but for the most part I was skimming pages because I already knew the material . So it is definitely geared towards someone starting out with CSS design . The strong vs. b tag was for the first time explained to me well and makes me want to change all the incorrect uses of the strong tag I 've made recently , but that would be too much work : ) <p> It was a good book though . I let a co-worker borrow it who is pretty much starting out with CSS design . He says he s learned a lot from it . <p> I have been frequently visiting Dans site and I have learnt quite a bit from him . I just got this book today and I cant wait to get into it . Thanks for the little review of the book Dave . hehe I also got that orange book you mentioned : ) <p> Thanks for saying something about it . Everytime I drive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and get it but I am forcing myself to finish my current book before I get it . It looks awesome though and from reading SimpleBits every so often I can tell the author knows what he is talking about . Ca n't wait to try it out ! <p> P.S. - I am stuck on a windows machine here at home where I am reading this right now and I noticed your forms look really good in IE ! Talk to you soon . <p> This book should be in every web designer/developers library . For beginners , its an excellent introduction to the concept of semantics . And as has been proven on Dans weblog , even seasoned experts need to think about this . There are a couple of questionable things in the book , but they are minor . Dans writing is really enjoyable and makes this tough subject a lot more palatable . <p> I 've just ordered two copies , one for our design dept and one for the software dept , our lead designers may disagree with one or two points , but for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its a godsend , saves me having to write it . thanks <p> They are n't  the same thing . &lt;strong&gt; means that the enclosed text is strongly emphasised . &lt;b&gt; just means that the enclosed text should be rendered in boldface . The fact that many browsers by default render &lt;strong&gt; in boldface is incidental . <p> If you want to strongly emphasise something , use &lt;strong&gt; . If you want to boldface it , use &lt;span&gt; with a class that indicates what it is and use CSS to make that boldfaced . <p> Read Dans book , and you 'll understand why semantics is a Good Thing and why structure should be separated from presentation . : )

@@99593511 @3793511/ <p> Unfettered by the freedom a 16.7 million colour palette offers , its compelling to use the full-colour version of a photo for maximum impact . <p> Using full-colour photography due to lack of technical limitations is a choice made by limited designers though . While not inherently wrong , the inevitable " its a full-colour photo , why not use it ? " is a simplistic view , and it can be equally argued that if we have a 26-letter alphabet , why not use all the letters in every sentence ? <p> Photography in the context of good design is used to accent and highlight . It can bring context to a piece , or provide additional information . A picture is worth a thousand words , but those thousand had better say something important , or they 're liable to fall on deaf ears . <p> Photographs are useful because they can provide realistic detail that will pump up an otherwise flat piece . However , as with any element of design , a balance needs to be struck between too dull and too much . <h> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the colour value to monochrome and then assigning it a uniform hue . Adjustments to the overall colour makeup can be made subtly with Photoshops adjustment layers . <p> Increasing the brightness of the red channel can change an outdoor scene from bleak and winter-esque to warm and summery by adding more warmth to the photo . Dropping the contrast and toning a portrait with subtle blue tones can add a melancholy feel that accentuates the subject . The experienced designer will tell you there are many levels between full colour and monochrome colour . <p> In figure 1 we see an ambiguous photo of a woman on the phone . What emotion is she showing ? Anger ? Excitement ? Triumph ? The designer can interpret it any way he wants , and reinforce his view by colouring the photo to match . <p> The original photo is on the left . The center photo has been toned with additional red to boost the dynamic nature of the photo and increase the visual tension . The woman takes on a more aggravated or angered look , simply due to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same photo has been toned a monochrome blue to cool it down and give it a more tranquil feel . The subject matter conflicts with the peace of this new colour scheme , however , so this particular variation is unsuccessful . <h> weight considerations <p> Sometimes a photo is needed to provide context for the surrounding text , but is n't as important as the text itself . A lush , vivid photo thrown into this scenario can only serve as a distraction and draw the readers eye away from the text . <p> This is illustrated in figure 2 , above . The panel is an ad that requires primary focus on the text . The example on the left uses the full-colour photo and seems to emphasize the " confusing " message of the piece , since the eye has no resting place within the borders of the white box . Too much is happening , and its overly confusing for the reader . The example on the right uses a toned version of the same photo that takes on the same lack of dominance as the less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ message in the foreground clearer and more easily readable . <p> The designers job is to make the decision on a case-by-case basis of what processing needs to be applied to the photography being used , if any . As in other facets of design no rules exist that ca n't be broken , but its important to establish a general guideline in your own work to keep your approach consistent , clean , and logical . <p> Develop an eye for picking up the most important part of a page . Determine if the surrounding photography adds to it . If the distraction is too great , figure out a way to pull it back and restore the focus to the element that deserves it . <p> Good design is part function , part form ; making the proper choices when processing your photographs will satisfy both sides of the equation . 30454 @qwx890454 30455 @qwx890455 30451 @qwx890451 <p> You are reading " Toned Photographs on the Web " , an entry posted on 19 November , 2002 , to the Pods collection .

There 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at me ? Yeah . That was pretty cool . <p> But anyway , your letter . So here 's the deal . I like accessibility .

Sure , you too . You want to visit my site in Mosaic ? Even you ! <p> See , Magic Dave , the great thing about CSS is that if a user agent does n't  support it it does n't  use it . This allows me to go fullout nuts in my style , while keeping the sites content accessible and viewable to everybody . Its a beautiful thing . Except when it does n't  work . <p> So what 's the problem then ?

This is an issue I 'm deeply concerned about , for obvious reasons . I 've had to tackle some hard questions head on when it comes to CSS theft . I still do n't  have any answers , only opinions . <p> Some excellent discussion ensued on both topics yesterday , but there was some confusion between them . Let 's free this topic from the specific case , and move along to the more general issue at hand . <p> CSS is a design language . Its the foundation of a site layout , just as much as PostScript is the foundation of a poster or brochure . Can the code itself be copyrighted ? <p> Views expressed yesterday covered the whole spectrum . Here are some of the more interesting thoughts : <p> " I 'd bet there havent been many lawsuits about this yet , and once they start happening at least well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go off . Itll be tricky to define exactly in what sense one owns a design and its code . After all , there are lots of 2-column , main content + sidebar pages out there , but each designer should be able to say that they own their particular implementation . " <p> " A layout has no visible parts . Its just how you use the space in the window . If I build a layout with a two-column header , a three-column content area and a two-column footer then there 's no way for me to tell someone else that they cant do the same thing . " <p> " Its an analogy that 's been used before , but CSS is nothing more than the grammar of web design . " <p> " Of course you ca n't copyright one &lt;h1&gt; selector , or one &lt;p&gt; selector in music , I cant really copyright a G or an A , or even a C Major chord ( though John Cages estate insists that all silence is under his copyright ) <p> " It is the combinatory effect of notes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that make CSS . " <p> " to raise CSS implementations from tech grammar to a copywritable collection of language will require a test in court to recognize it as such . " <p> And I 'm just going to quote this next one in its entirety , since I find it brilliantly well-reasoned . Thanks Raena ! <p> I took a photo of a sculpture in the city once . I did n't  make my camera , the sculpture I photographed , the film in the camera , or the paper it was printed on . I did n't  come up with the theories behind use of light or composition . Other photographers use all those same tools all the time . There have to be thousands if not millions of photographs of sculptures , and undoubtedly there are plenty of other photographs of that very same sculpture . <p> Yet I have every right to copyright that photograph . <p> You say that a CSS file lacks originality in the sense that CSS and XHTML are the grammar for a Web design and everyone else can use the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole , the end product , that is original work . Thought has been put into the composition of the CSS file , even though the designer does n't  happen to be the inventor of the CSS spec . <p> " You can copyright a slogan , but not the sentence structure or the words that go to make it up . " <p> Actually , you cant generally copyright a slogan , just as you can not copyright a title , name , or short phrase : its too small . You can protect your slogan with a trademark if its connected to a product or a service , but there is a minimum amount of authorship . <p> In most cases , copyright can not be placed on something without sufficient originality . What can not be copyrighted : <p> a compilation of works , unless some original thought was put into the arrangement ( no to the phone book , yes to Worlds Greatest Beer-Drinking Songs ) <p> it can not simply be a mechanical reproduction of something ( I ca n't copyright that Chemical Brothers CD I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have sufficient originality to be considered copyrightable . I 'm not convinced that a CSS file with the complexity of the Fleshbot spec does n't  count . It is an expression , done in a particular way to create a particular result , even if that result is similar to other works . <p> " Let 's face it a CSS file is an hour or two and a text-editor . " <p> Bzzt , wrong answer . That photo I mentioned earlier was a thirty second snap-decision to go stand someplace , squint through a little window and press a button . How much effort is required for original work to deserve protection ? Three hours ? Twelve ? Ten minutes , but only if its really really really hard ? <p> In US caselaw , the sweat of the brow argument was rejected several years ago in Feist Publications v Rural Telephone Co . As well as pointing out that a phone book is n't creative or original enough to constitute a copyrightable work , the 6th Circuit ruled that the amount of effort one puts into creating something has no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Well , in that case i think it might apply to cases in which CSS is used in unusual , innovative , original ways " <p> So its only the unusual , innovative , original , oh-my-god type stuff that deserves protection by copyright ? Oh-oh , there goes the protection for about half of todays pop music . <p> A work does n't  have to be any good to be protected by copyright . It just needs to have an element of original authorship . <p> But what about you , Dave Shea ? What do you think ? <p> The community surrounding web standards and CSS particularily thrives on sharing .

It took a long while before I managed to put the pieces together , and realize that it symbolizes something called RSS ( which is inexplicably labelled XML , about as useful as labelling a desklamp Wires and Glass ) . <p> The worst part is how avoidable this confusion is . A simple page explaining the feeds is all it takes . This site has been using an explanatory page that lists associated feeds for ages . Simple , but necessary . <p> Still , in the interest of pushing the bar , Ive taken to some further experimentation . Others like Sam and Anne have been playing around with CSS and various syndication formats . While I 'm completely out of my element here , I 've managed to take Annes lead and use a touch of XSL mixed with CSS to actually do something useful with an experimental feed . <p> Since I believe the XSL must be parsed client-side ( so that the RSS can actually be used as RSS , rather than XHTML ) , this will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being .

Now I have a nice tight example . <p> Elaine - excellent question . The proponents of RSS might be wise to put together a non-technical resource for end users instead of developers .

I 've not actually seen any user interaction with RSS feeds or syndication , but your observations make sense . <p> Down at my day job were trying the push the usefulness of RSS to our stakeholders and content contributers and these issues are very good ones to know about . What 's even better is you 've pointed out solutions . Thanks . <p> Client side XSL has been around for ages . I did a whole site in it about 2 and a half years ago only to find that Microsofts XML handling code was buggy and could crash IE , and sometimes even crash Windows . The site was abandoned because I was certainly not going to release the first website to ever kill someones computer outright . Also the Mozilla builds at the time would show the XML for a half-second before repainting the processed document , even when it was cached . <p> I revisited it about a year ago and found some of the problems still existed ( mainly in loops and deep recursion ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a grand scale , but it wont catch on until its guaranteed to at least not crash the browser and OS . <p> Why client side XSLT ? I suppose its easy , and you 're probably not loosing anything in the case that the browser does n't  understand XSLT but , on the other hand , the browser has always seemed like the wrong level to implement XSLT . If you have content that needs to be transformed , transform it on the server and send the transformed content over the wire . Browsers are hard enough to write without full XSLT support being an additional requirement . <p> In this case , the right solution seems to be checking the browser Accept header ( I think that 's the right name ) , to see which content types it likes . If it prefers ( X ) HTML , send that , if it prefers RSS , send that . <p> Server-side would be preferable , I 'm sure of that . I just do n't  have the coding chops to build a negotiation script . I did n't  even think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side , you break newsreaders , so avoiding it was easier . <p> I have n't tried XSL yet for my feed but I use PHP to generate the feed in a file named : rss.php It works fine in newsreader like Feedreader and FeedDemon . So server side feeds are supossed to work even with extensions like . php or . asp <p> good stuffimplemented a very simple version of it on http : **33;1542;TOOLONG for our current RDF and it works a treat ( although i still need to delve into xslt a bit more to make it a tad more exciting ) <p> Personally , I do n't  believe it is an issue at all ; most aggregators nowadays have auto-discovery for RSS feeds - the cute little orange XML buttons should n't even be linked , since its only there to signify the existance of an RSS feed . No ? <p> I actually despise the popularity of the little orange buttons , because its not just XML , its RSS built on XML . I also do n't  like that its generally accepted to use . xml @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sometimes choke on . rss , which is kind of weird . We never use . xml on our XHTML files , so why for RSS ? <p> That was somewhat off-topic , sorry for the rant . Anyways , great demonstration of XSLT . For various reasons , I think XSLT is actually better on the client side ( web standards should never be dependent on server-side preprocessing ) , but each to his own . <p> Now , I may be wrong , but I think I remember there being way of attaching a CSS file to any generic XML document . I believe its done with , which would make sense . I think that might be a better option than transforming the document itself . You could style the RSS elements without any transformation . Makes sense to me . I think CSS is supposed to be a universal styling syntax , not just for one particular strain of XML . Unfortunately , support for this is probably at about the same level as XSLT . <p> Anyways , cool example ; XSLT is going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adding CSS to an arbitrary XML file is a piece of cake . Use the xml-stylesheet linking syntax , and away you go . Give it a shot ; I thought of providing an alternate CSS file as a backup for Safari with this RSS feed , but I have n't gotten it working properly yet . <p> A problem Ive run into doing that in the past is that the data really could use a cleaning up in advance sometimes , which makes XSLT ideal . Although I 'm sure creative PHP could handle it just fine . <p> I 'm glad someone else does n't  like the orange XML buttons ( where did those come from anyway ? ) . I had used RSS feeds with a news aggregator ( NetNewsWire 8- ) long before I ever encountered one of those cryptic orange buttons . I knew what XML was , but did n't  know what the button was . So I clicked it . It took me to a page which had a few lines of pretty meaningless text . I viewed the source , and realized it was an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say XML instead of RSS which would have been a gabillion times more useful ? I do n't  know , but the button seems to have caught on ( does some blog software use it ? I think a lot of Radio blogs have them ) . <p> Anyway , I 'm glad I 'm not the only one who does n't  like them , at least without any explaination . <p> PS : Hi Dave , I 've visited your site before , but this is my first comment . None of the comment form fields have labels , so I just guessed where to put my name and email I 'm using Camino , and am probably reporting a known problem which you cant do anything about . Anyway thanks for the read ! <p> 1 . XSL is VERY expensive to run . Most big sites could never use live XSL transformation of dynamic content. * 2 . Just as you have different CSS files , you can have different XSL files for different view/uses of the site ( as the RSS feed illustrates ) . You can also set up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heck of a lot faster than the fully processed document , especially when you set up linked stylesheets that are cached in the browser and pulled in as needed . 4 . Its a big step in the direction of delivering semantically rich information . Although I do n't  agree , people often complain that ( X ) HTML is n't very semantic , with a well-defined schema no such complaints can be said about an XML document . <p> *XTP from Caucho actually makes this possible but this is n't the right place to discuss that type of stuff . <p> On my weblogs ( e.g. the one linked to from my name ) , I use a javascript popup window to respond when the user clicks on it in a friendly way , explaining what its for . The button is still a valid link that you can copy or drag to your favorite news reader like NetNewsWire , but it does n't  fill up your screen with junk . ( AOL Journals does something similar , I believe . ) <p> This is pretty off topic but I got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first time an acronym is used your site has it correctly tagged as an acronym , with the correct text expansion for it in the tag . <p> Now , maybe I 'm wrong but I cant believe everyone here is tagging their comments for you - and I doubt you are editing everyones comments by hand - so how do you do it ? Is there a plugin to your comment system that does it ? <p> 1 ) Agreed that XSL can be very expensive . But it is wrong to say that big websites cant handle XSL on the server ; they can , and they do . eBay is just *one* example among many . ( Actually , eBays backend presentation layer is much more sophisticated than one might think , given their ugly output markup . ) <p> 2 ) The server side can handle as many stylesheets as you like , and there 's nothing stopping you from pulling them from remote/3rd-party servers at any point during the process . <p> Rijk - you 'll notice the sample weblog you linked to does n't  actually have any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ newsreader , but skipping the links in the browser kind of defeats the purpose of truncated-entry RSS , does n't  it ? That 's a good demonstration of why a little transformation is nice . <p> Actually , I take that last part back about #4 . I agree with you about ( X ) HTML and its semantic potential . It is a bad idea to serve up some other XML format to end-users just for philosophical reasons , i.e. because XHTML " is n't semantic enough . " There has to be a solid technological reason . <p> Dave , IIRC you 're now on a server that can handle PHP ? I have the same issue that you do as far as being on several computers and wanting to synchronise my reading , and now I swear by Feed on Feeds ( http : **34;1577;TOOLONG ) . <p> If I had the time , I 'd customize the heck out of it because I do n't  like the default layout , but as far as keeping track of what I 'm reading , it rocks . <p> Matt , thanks for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ descriptions for the " no-bie " emerge over time . <p> NetNewsWire is , as has been said , very nice and works well with Safari . <p> However , I hesitate to say this as I really do love OS X , but the best piece of software I ever bought for it was Alsoft Diskwarrior . <p> Over time , even OS X needs de-fragging . And if you need to press control+command+the power button , inevitably there will be some damage that needs repairing . <p> sorry , I 've got a bit OT . It was a good idea to have RSS : as you say , it functions in some ways like a replacement for mailing-lists - and as email is pretty much broken ( owing to spam ) RSS can only get more popular . <p> Paul : thanks for the bloglines.com tip . Great service ! And Dave , you mentioned having an issue with news aggregators not being syncd among your primary computers as far as what youve already read . Perhaps bloglines.com would be to your liking since its web-based ? <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head but do n't  know why I never voiced it to someone who has the chops to make it work . : ) <p> As for a resource to point people to , I think something like rss.lockergnome.com would be a good non-techie place to point people . Of course , it would be even better if there was a blogosphere community resource that described it even better than that , and also explained the technical terms for the would-be techies and the real geeks but then , well , I 'm probably dreaming in thinking that everyone would get along . : ) <p> Thanks for posting this Dave , since the last site I built was in xhtml 1.1 , and I 've been looking at Atom test feeds , I could n't help but notice that syndication feeds are getting easier to read while HTML is looking more like XML everyday , and why have two files instead of just one ? <p> I remember playing with XSL and IE 5 back in early 2000 , the support was hit and miss and you could n't do much but simple loops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed to work in the then-new IE5 for mac , I had to drop it for intranet use . I had n't  thought to try it again on rss or atom feeds . <p> When I first saw this technique on Annes site , I was impressed . The XSL certainly makes the feed look a lot better . But it still seems confusing to present another version of the same content . Users will still wonder what the point is . I 'm still not satisfied with what we have here . But then again , I probably wont be happy until the only RSS links are those embedded in &lt;LINK&gt; tags . <p> I agree . A server side aggregator , like Bloglines ( if you want ready to go , works right away ) or Feed on Feeds ( if you want free , Free , and customizability ) is a must , if you read feeds on more than one machine . <p> Hmm . I 've just had thought that for sites using client side xsl files ( which if IE 6 can handle them may become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a link to a stylesheet that renders it in a similar fashion to you RSS style sheet . If that makes sense , I 'm a bit brain melted right now . The way I see it though is you look at a page , do view source and go " ooo let 's look at the style sheet " and when you do that you get another nice looking page displaying the stylesheet . And the stylesheet that does this also can display itself in a nice fashion . Ok its only really useful on a page that is being used for teaching type of stuff ( like here for instance ) but it might be worth a thought . I 've done a few tests on it and will do some more when I get home . <p> Have to disagree about XSL not being useful for larger sites . We 've just built a corporate intranet for a large ( 100,000+ employees ) company and we use XSL to create all the navigational elements . The sites navigation is stored in an XML skeleton , allowing the client to make major @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ update all pages to prevent broken links . We use separate XSL sheets to pull each level of navigation plus the DHTML menus and it works nicely . <p> CodeMonkeyX : No , that 's not the case . It is quite possible to have one file served up as different content types to different user agents . Facilitating this is the purpose of the Accept header that the browser sends . <p> Using Apache , it ought to be quite simple to do what is required for serving RSS to RSS readers and HTML to web browsers using the MultiViews option ( this allows you to send distinct files with the requested filename but difdferent extensions in response to different Accept headers ) . In fact , I tried this , and it worked ; but only when I specified the headers sent by the UA . Using a small sample of RSS readers , they could n't detect a feed at my test location , suggesting they were being sent the html instead . I do n't  know if there 's any standard in the accept header for RSS readers ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason alone . <p> Notice that the logical conclusion of this approach is to have no feed link at all , anywhere on the site . Instead , you could point a browser at the homepage and get ( X ) HTML , and point a feed reader at the page and get sent atom or RSS , as it prefered . But to do this , feed readers need to send consistent and useful headers . <p> Common practice seems to be to include the RSS feed as a link in a META tag , while also providing an orange XML button to make your readers aware of the feed . Other sites have a Feeds page that lists a variety of feeds available ( eg : the latest comments , latest news etc . ) <p> The W3C homepage has a nice feed ( link below ) that gets styled by a simple stylesheet so the browser shows it in boxes and various fonts . Unfortunately , unlike Daves example , the links are n't  clickable ( there 's no embedded HTML there - unless there 's a CSS command @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Like you can make anything a table or table cell ( so lists can be styled as cells ) ) . <p> Dris : " I actually despise the popularity of the little orange buttons , because its not just XML , its RSS built on XML . " <p> Ahem . Someone else forgetting what XML stands for . Its a framework on which to build whatever you like ( eg : XAML ) . So RSS built with XML is perfectly sane . And since the RSS *is* XML , why not use an XML button ? Or better still , one that reads " RSS ( XML ) " or " RSS/XML " . I 've seen some sites with buttons for every variation of RSS as a feed ! <p> A great page for explaining all the versions of RSS comes from Mark Pilgrim at XML.com : <p> With todays browser there is a simple solution for linking your rss content : reformat it via css . Anybody knowing what to do with rss can use it in his favourite news aggregator , and the guys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ content , but reformatted in a nice and viewable way . <p> I 've seen styleheets that do this knocking around for a while now . Actually I had n't  considered the usability problems , what I had considered was scripting a page that let the user add feeds of there choice , all translated using xslt/css , an online aggregator if you will . This has been on my todo list for at least a year , if people are going to start inlining stylesheets I 'll have to remember to parse those out . <p> A bit late to the party here , I know , but I 'd like to point out that I am fairly certain its not just IE 6 that can handle client-side XSLT. 5.5 and possibly 5.0 can do it as well , and IE generally does it quite well the msxml core code is fairly well regarded I think . <p> It took me browsing this site with my handheld to find the essentials section ( yes , I 'm new around here ) . Great idea about the RSS feed information page , much better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ W3C XHTML Strict buttons and company right out the door . Not so sure that once you get to the information page you still should be nervous about the user clicking the RSS feed , but either way XSL could surely help . My disagreeability comes with the lack of enthusiasm for server-side XSL transforms . <p> Any server-side processing alleviates all worries about " does it look correct on the client-side ? " , that alone is worth its weight in gold . Want to keep your XSL logic under lock and key ? Solved with server-side processing , nobody can find it without an HREF . Transforming XML to XHTML is here now , it is widely used and extremely useful . I try to keep my content in XML form ( or database ) , then translate it to whatever medium need be . This is where XSL comes in and my appreciation for ASP.NET . I know the majority of folks here are not Windows fans , hence the lack of mention of ASP.NET and its excellent support of XSL Transforms . I 'm not familiar with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its still in the beginning stages . <p> What about efficiency ? Server-side caching is not ground-breaking and solves the problem by abstracting from the programmer . If the XML or XSL has n't  changed , then show ( send to client ) the already parsed XHTML ( from the XML/XSLT ) , the web server takes care of all this for us ( if configured to do so ) . Very quick response and does n't  leave the XSL parsing to client . What if you want the raw XML ? Integrate a link ( perhaps the orange RSS button ) into your XSL document that links to the raw RSS feed ( raw XML ) . OK , enough with the banter and on with some real-life examples 
@@99593516 @3793516/ <p> Most people got it ; but for anyone who misinterpreted my laundry list of rants from last time , that was just some healthy critiquing of my own work . Its a good idea to step back every now and then and judge what you do with a critical eye . The truth is I 'm very pleased with the way this redesign came off . here 's why . <p> jQuery <p> I 'd like to thank the star of our show , John Resigs fabulous jQuery library . No doubt you noticed the portfolio page effects , with sliding and zooming and fading and the like . Yep , that 's Javascript . No Flash here . I 've only been playing with jQuery for a few months now , but its already one of those " how did I live without it ? " tools . <p> To me its the difference between avoiding Javascript as much as possible , and embracing it whole-heartedly . jQuery abstracts away the hard stuff like DOM incompatibilities , leaving me free to write fairly basic script to accomplish what I need . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learned that so its building on what I know . I 'm still not convinced I 'm much of a scripter , but writing with jQuery makes me feel like I 'm actually somewhat in control when it comes to Javascript . And the joy of seeing my script work as expected first time round across the board when testing in various browsers ? Undefinable . <p> With this design I wanted to see what kind of useful user interaction effects I could pull off with some jQuery magic . I had a vague idea in mind to use sliding portfolio pages , echoing something I did with the previous designs thumbnails . But I also wanted to treat the slideable area as real content with enlarged previews and live text . I looked at a few canned scripts that seemed to do what I wanted , including some jQuery plugins like Coda Slider and various lightboxes , but ended up needing a bit more flexibility . So I rolled my own . <p> There 's nothing particularly new or clever about my implementation , but it came together nicely . I have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the class item , and in my CSS file that class is treated as a non-scripted element by default . I 'd hoped for graceful degradation when Javascript is disabled , and the default rendering without script is actually somewhat usable . Its not great , but it works . <p> Then on page load , the script does a bit of work to change that default and get the page ready for interaction , things like adding new classes and then re-positioning the divs based on those classes . The resulting style of the elements updated by the script is still handled in the CSS file as a new set of classes , triggered by that scripted changing of the class . That 's the ideal , but I did need to script some of the positions , so there are a few spots where hard-coded pixel values ended up in Javascript . I 'm sure there 's a way to make it more elegant , but that 's as far as I got . <p> The actual slide effect happens by giving each individual item in the portfolio a sequential position within a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ value of each based on which item the user is currently viewing . The current frame has a left value of 0 , the next is 750 , the one after that is 1500 , and so on . Frames prior to current are negative values , ie. -750 , -1500 and so on . And then by declaring overflow : hidden on the parent frame I 'm hiding the inactive items and only showing the active item so you never see more than one at a time . This allow let 's me slide things in and out of the frame without more tedious clipping calculations , something I 'd far rather let the browser handle . <p> That was the quick easy way to do it , but it also led to the expandability problem I wrote about in the previous post ; I ca n't use overflow : auto in the portfolio area to allow for a scrollbar when the user resizes the text , because the divs intended to be hidden by the overflow end up forcing scrollbars and making a mess of the page . The unscripted version allows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sweet irony . <p> The larger previews triggered on click are also added with script ; in an unscripted state these are simple links to images that open in the same window , a fairly clumsy way of doing it , but at least the unscripted state is functional . Again by manipulating the classes in script , I change those links into positioned target areas that have an onclick event which pulls in the target image of the link as the contents of the pop-up area . There 's a nice jQuery fade effect too , though the first image load usually takes longer than the fade so the effect looks more like a vertical slide-down than a fade . But once that baby is cached after that first click , watch out . Fades for everyone . <p> Something a little more subtle than the portfolio effects is the logo and primary nav hover glowing animation . This is a trick I demoed at An Event Apart last month , and I 'm about 2/3rds of the way through formally writing it up . I 'm using jQuery to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ produce a smoother transition between off and on states . Its a tiny bit more involved than that , as you 'll see if you dig into the source . But keep your eyes peeled for the article , there will likely be a pre-built function that abstracts anything remotely difficult about it . Oh , and yes , it gracefully degrades to plain old CSS Sprites . <p> Copywriting <p> Updating the copy was a big reason for redesigning the site . The previous version was built at a time when I did n't  have a clear idea of what the business would be in one , two , or five years . Since that time I 've figured out what it is I want to do and how I do it , but the site did n't  reflect that . I 'd been handing out an intro PDF to new clients for a while to fill that gap , but its the sort of information that really needed to be directly on the site . <p> I ended up scrapping almost everything that existed before , and changing the voice from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ direct " I " . This did n't  come easily ; it was hard to adjust to talking about myself in the informal first person on an ostensibly professional site . But I often get email starting out with " Im looking to contact Dave Shea " , or " do you guys offer such and such a service ? " , so I realized it was time to kill the ambiguity . <p> There were two items I felt a bit conflicted about putting out there . In my previously private PDF I had included details about pricing and process that would be helpful for prospective clients , but its the kind of information that people in our industry do n't  generally publish on public-facing sites . I have some theories why this is , and they 're not all to do with competition , but the result is the same in any case . I decided to go ahead anyway , a decision which I do n't  know will prove to be a good or bad idea long term ; well know for sure if it ends up going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was actually one of the least important things I needed to accomplish this time around . When I began planning this redesign , I tackled the scripting and copywriting first , and only opened Photoshop after I had a pretty clear idea of what the content was going to be . You know , the same sort of expectations youd have of a client ; I believe the phrase were looking for here is " eating your own dog food " . <p> Somehow I ended up building a colour scheme derived from primaries , though the red , yellow and blue are not exactly full saturation , and the brown of the content area serves as more of a neutral in this case . Previously I 'd been using brighter shades of red and yellow , so there 's some consistency with the past , but the blue was a new addition this time for the sake of more interesting colour contrast . The overall tone is a lot darker than last time , but that feels like a good change . <p> This visual design is n't a huge departure either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , non-pristine feel to it that I wanted to continue using . I went for broke on the texture and detail work , but that ended up causing some fun layering challenges . After the Photoshop work was done , I spent some time looking at the design wondering how in the world I 'd build it out into something that would work in a browser . In the last post I mentioned that transparent PNGs would have spared me some headaches , but I do n't  feel like I can yet thanks to IE6 . So I went with GIF images instead , which caused a lot of tedious matching of foreground and background images . Saving a transparent GIF to sit on top of a solid colour is easy ; saving one with texture that must precisely align with a second background texture while fading out into transparent areas is not so much . <p> For example , the portfolios white stage area sits on top of the pages background texture . Its drop shadow and frilly decorative bits have varying levels of opacity , something GIF obviously cant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ background texture into the image itself , which forced precise alignment of the foreground and background images . I could have gotten away with simply flattening my Photoshop file and saving out the background with the image as a big non-transparent rectangle , but that would have made the sites already-large image profile even larger . So I dropped what background I could by first hiding the background in Photoshop and saving a preliminary transparent 1-bit GIF to basically create an outline of the foreground area , then loading that GIF back into Photoshop and using it to create a mask for the background , then saving the combined foreground + background combo out together into the final GIF . It looks like this . <p> There are also some extra little details I added to try and elevate the HTML-based text to something a bit more interesting . I applied text-shadow to the various headers and links for Safaris benefit . Primary h2s on the site have a very faint PNG absolutely positioned over top that fades in the background texture a little , resulting in a semi-transparent almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a challenge ; my first attempt worked well in Safari , while the overlay was too obvious in other browsers . So I had to tinker with various colour output settings and finally got something that seems like a good enough compromise . The PNG is still somewhat visible in all browsers , but faint enough that I can live with it . ( and I did a lot of Googling for workarounds ; what you 're thinking of suggesting ? I tried it . ) <p> Contact Form <p> Finally , one of my favourite bits from the site , the contact forms Stress-o-meter . This was a fun little idea I had in mind from the beginning , but it was the last thing I built because I was n't quite sure how to make it go . Design-wise , there are three levels : Low , Medium , and High . The higher it gets , the more distressed the meter looks . <p> Luckily it ended up being easier to build than I expected . There 's a simple text file sitting on the server with a date @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I have a PHP script that opens that file and reads the date . If todays date is within a certain number of days from the previous date it will display Low , and if its above that range it shows Medium . There 's a second range it checks that will show High . I 'm still working on precise values , right now Medium is 5 days and High is 10 . <p> That 's it for the viewing part , the updating part was pretty basic too . I 've created a cron job on the server to run a second script every couple of days . That script sends me an email asking me whether I want to update the meter , which is just a link to a third script that replaces the contents of the text file with todays date . If I do n't  hit the link , nothing changes , and the previous range checking script will compensate . That 's it . Simple . I 'm still wondering if various spiders are going to find the update script or not , but a permanent Low status @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so I 'm not terribly worried . <p> Ive been becoming a fan of jQuery in recent months too . I first started using it for form validation but since then have been finding more and more uses for it and now if I ever need a script to produce a particular effect that Ive used in the past , I 'll try and find a jQuery plugin alternative . <p> Great work . Love the site . I 'm most impressed with the copy . I think that it reads really well and people will get a feel for who you are . Its also very inspiring I 've come to the conclusion this year , that I wont be growing , so I should look at my own content . <p> Its interesting what you 're saying about the copywriting . I 've made many design mockups ( to be honest , I 'm too lazy lately , especially because of the lack of tools in my location atm , to really work on any websites lately ) , I have to write about myself . Like you said , the change from the formal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a big change . To at the same time be professional but personal is a hard change to accomplish without sounding too arrogant . <p> The rest of it , interesting to read your approach , especially the part about code first , design later , which 37signals brought up a few days ago as well . <p> @Jesse Dijkstra " To at the same time be professional but personal is a hard change to accomplish without sounding too arrogant . " <p> Definitely . I had that same problem ; you want to say " look at all this cool stuff Ive done " without making it sound like your ego has expanded to fill an entire city block . There 's a balance there , and its hard to find . <p> " code first , design later , which 37signals brought up a few days ago as well . " <p> Well , its fair to say we have different perspectives on that one . My own code-first was just working out the Javascript interaction , it was n't doing actual design work like the HTML/CSS approach they suggest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I think Greg Storey sums it up as well as any : LONG ... <p> I just inadvertently sent you some spam . Perhaps some basic email address validation in the contact form would n't go astray ? I did n't  even put an @ in there . <p> Anyway , nice work , and I agree with most of your critiques/observations . I also have to agree that jQuery is particularly good for us CSSy types to jump into Javascript . I started messing with it more than a year ago now and havent looked back since . <p> Oh and I also meant to add my 2c about text resizing . I too always test my stuff for resizing , but since FF3 , IE7 and Opera all support full page zooming now ( and IE6 effectively able to locked down should you wish , by px sizing ) I feel that it I can let it slide on occasion now-days without feeling to bad about it . I think an easy to read standard size/contrast and good semantics etc for screen readers is far more important . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impairment all have there OS set to 640x480 with extra large font , and use a screen reader regardless . <p> Anyway , I cant remember EVER coming across a non-geek client/friend/earthling who was even aware that their browser could re-size text . People still using IE6 are somehow even less aware of it , if that is possible . <p> P.S. Being able to zoom FF3 , Opera/IE7 style now is so great for couch-computer usage ! Much better than the old text-only method . <p> I am excited you redesigned BC , I was wondering when that was going to happen . You know all those fans of yours out there , heh . I have been really into jQuery and find its easy for a css coder like myslef to pick it up . jQuery is really gaining momentum right now . I 'm very pleased to know you have taken advantage of it . Bright creative is amazing and very inspiring . You took some of the best jquery and new css techniques to push web design up another notch . Excellent job . Ill be interested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have been looking for way to avoid using img tags for that . <p> Rudimentary user verification for your scripts might be in order . Nothing fancy , just something that will keep spiders from resetting your counter inadvertently . Maybe just have the script do nothing if you do n't  call it with a particular set of arguments . Or something . Since it is n't a critical system I would n't waste too much time on it , but by Murphys law the spiders will find it . : ) <p> jQuery is something ive come accross a fre imes in the past , it is hard to find a framework that works in each browser , one example of this not working is mootools , this a lot of the time has that annoying error on page in the bottom left hand corner . <p> also to agree with dave holland CSS Zen Garden inspried me and i 'm sure a lot of people to the real power of CSS . <p> I was thinking about your notes on the jquery slide effect and I 've put together something you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was experimenting with . Its using the dimensions plugin which is now a part of the jquery core ( v1.2+ ) . <p> Wow , you just proved that its possible to make modern webdesign work in IE6 , without png . I can see that would have taken , well , pretty much forever . <p> But I cant get your portfolio fade to work properly , I get the blind scrolling down like you described , and only get the fade-in when I click the same thumb over again . Which means most of the time I get the vertical-blind-down , since I 'm more likely to not click the same preview consecutively . <p> Still , love the design . <p> I 've got to throw in some CSS questions too . I noticed you 're being very specific in your line-heights and font-sizes . Does browsers really accept 4 decimals specificy on ems ? And what does the opacity : 0.99999 do ? I have a hunch its got something to do with Firefox , but please elaborate . Thanks . <p> The Bright Creative site is simply beautiful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about it in my opinion , is the logo and navigation on hover state . Ive been trying to figure out how to do that for a long time now , and I fail every time ! Hahaha . <p> @Eystein Aln+s - " But I ca n't get your portfolio fade to work properly " <p> Sounds like it does work for you , but only after the image loads . Which is pretty much how I described it . Its not ideal , but I 'm not a fan of lightbox-like spinning wheel graphics and the brief delay between when you click and when the image is displayed . <p> " Does browsers really accept 4 decimals specificy on ems ? " <p> The values are derived from careful calculations of the font size . The main body font size is 62.5% which ends up being equivalent to 10px , so if I set font-size to 1.2em then I get 12px text ( that remains scalable ) . Then to get , for example , 14px line-height I have to do a bit of math to find out what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1.16666666 so I ( arbitrarily ) round to 4 decimal places and get a line-height of 1.1667 . Whether a browser applies that exact value or not does n't  really matter , what 's important is that the proportions remain the same if the user scales up the text size . <p> " what does the opacity : 0.99999 do ? " <p> Forces anti-aliasing to get around a bug in the browsers font rendering . More here : <p> Dave , though its an expensive fix , CS3 ( at least for Mac ) no longer embeds gamma data in PNGs when using save for web . Ive devd probably 30-50 sites and have yet to see any color shift in any browser/platform combo , including IE6 on Windows . Prior to CS3 I was running my PNG files through Gamma Slamma and the results were the same . Perhaps you already tried both of these things but I have yet to run into a discrepancy in color . <p> On the design : Love that you went with a grittier/worn look for such a professinal site . Ive been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and had been a little worried the wicked worn style was n't professional enough . Youve inspired me though , and I 'm going forward with it now ! <p> On the logo/menu effect : I 'm at the edge of my seat waiting to see the write up on the fade effect . I 've spent all morning looking for a way to implement something similar on my site , and cant think of a better designer to learn it from . <p> Hi , I just wanted to tell you , that brightcreative.com kind of halts my system . Opening as a tab in the backround is no problem , but once I display the tab I have to wait about a minute until it is displayed ( and my OS reacts again ) . Everything works flawless then until I open an other page of your site : Same issue there . I 'm using Firefox 3 on Ubuntu 8.04 . I think I 'll fill a bug report if I have time . Best regards , Jakob . <p> what are your thoughts on using javascript ? Do you worry if your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to me that nobody has javascript disabled anyways ; so is it really a big deal ? <p> On the topic of CSS , why do so many people make this program so complicated ? Every time I try to learn a new CSS technique , I feel like I 'm reading something out of a physics book . CSS is like this new language that is only spoken in certain countries.why cant it be explained in a simple manner ? <p> An excellent post here . I 've heard about jquery but never had a chance to look at it properly but Ive seen a few sites that use it and they look really good . I can only write css and html but something like jquery would be ideal for me to make a fancy site with side scrolling pages without much knowledge of javascript .

@@99593518 @3793518/ <p> Today was a sick day thanks to some bad chicken wings last night , so sticking with the theme , let 's bring up the subject of colour . Yes , I said colour with a U : that 's the Canadian ( and I 'm told British ) spelling of the word ( those followers ) . <p> Sparked by a conversation with the ever-understated and humble Joe Clark ( in the flesh , no less , due to the recent ATypI conference taking place not 15 blocks from my doorstep ) , and continued by a thread over at Jon Hicks place , what has been coming up frequently is talk about colour-blindness . Specifically that working with colour requires you consider the percentage of the population who have troubles viewing said colour . <p> Firstly though , run , do not walk , over to Pixys Colour Scheme Picker application . Bookmark it , use it , and love it in every which way possible . This is the same Pixy that brought us the wildly ingenious CSS image hovers with preload The Czech web design scene is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cant wait to see what else Pixy brings to light for us Anglophones. ( thanks to Nick for bringing this to my attention on the Digital Web What 's New board ) <p> Now that you 're armed , here 's what you need to know . Colour deficiencies are varied and specific to the viewer , so although Pixy and others have come up with mechanical ways to simulate the deficiencies , these can only be used as an approximation and not a final word . Additionally , converting a design to monochrome is n't an indicator of what someone without colour abilities will view . <p> But there are certain truths in working with colour that can be exploited for your benefit . These are what were interested in . <p> For maximum legibility , black text on a white background is the holy grail of on-screen design . This is not to say that every single instance of every single design entails using solely black on white . In fact , to some people ( especially those on LCD monitors , which have amazingly high contrast ratios to begin with ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ principle is a starting point : dark text on light background is more legible than light text on dark background , and contrast between the text and what it sits on determines how easy it is to read . <p> Now consider colour . If you use coloured text on a white background , you are moving away from the ideal . This in itself is n't a problem , but ignoring deficiencies for a second , a wide range of tonal value exists within the visible spectrum . Value is a hard concept to grasp for non-designers , so first the technical description , followed by an illustration . Art Fundamentals : Theory and Practice ( publisher McGraw-Hill , 1998 ) defines it this way : <p> The property of color known as value distinguishes between the lightness and darkness of colors , or the quantity of light a color reflects . <p> Simply put , some colours appear darker than others . Purple is a dark colour , red is middle of the road , and yellow is light . Figures 1.1 and 1.3 attempt to demonstrate the difference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knowledge , its not a stretch to see how using yellow text on a white background is ridiculously low in contrast , but using purple text on white could work . <p> What about the person who has trouble with purple though ? There are many schools of thinking on this , and no definitive answers right now . Many who have trouble viewing purple and blue see the two colours as the same ; the value of the colour may persist , despite confusion over the precise hue . <p> But we can see that converting our work to greyscale is n't an accurate test . Consider Figure 1.2 the same colours shown in Figure 1.1 have been mechanically converted to monochrome , and come out an identical shade of grey . Photoshop sees the colours as being equal in value , but our eyes do not . Photoshop is value-blind , so we cant accurately test work this way . <p> Note : Douglas Bowman has pointed out that other methods of converting to greyscale produce more accurate greyscale values . I 'm aware of at least three different conversion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in mind that none of these are meant to be simulations of colour-blindness either , they 're merely software algorithms to represent values . Nothing about an algorithm can simulate the human eye , they can only ever be approximations . <p> Jonathan , you added the comment before I revised the post , so Ill address the specific tools . I 've used both , and find them to be interesting guides . They have the potential to highlight problems , but as I assert in my revision , software cant duplicate the complexity of the human eye . <p> Note that I AM repeating learned knowledge here , and nothing I 've studied in excruciating detail . But just as taste in colour palettes is unique to the viewer , so too is colour deficiency . Nobody relies on software to coordinate their furniture , so it stands to reason that the tools can only generalize , and will inevitably not cover everyone . <p> I am partially ( probably mostly ) red-green color blind -although I can see some reds and some greens . When I get a chance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ application screens about how to help make pages readable based mainly on my personal experience . <p> I find these to be useful for someone like me - <p> 1 ) Do not pair the difficult color pairs - red &amp; green , or yellow &amp; blue - to encode differences . Instead , use a color from the most common deficit - red/green - with one from one of the other most common deficits - e.g. , blue/yellow . That way , at least one should be detectable by a large fraction of users . <p> 2 ) Use differences in gray scale in parallel with colors to encode differences . I think up to four different gray shades are usually detectable . Treat the gray scale densities as if the colors were going to be copied on a monochrome copier - you would certainly want to make use of gray scale differences then . <p> 3 ) I can often detect colors when they are bright or have a relatively large area - a thin line may be impossible to discriminate , a wide one may work acceptably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with those of another . For example , mix yellow in with a green and blue in with a red . I realize that this advice may somewhat mess up some color schemes , but it can really help people like me . Mixed-in colors seems to be the main reason I can tell red traffic lights from green ones - they are bright and apparently do not use pure reds and greens . <p> 5 ) Instead of relying on different line colors , try to use line widths to encode differences ( they can still be colored ) . Three widths seem to me to work well and still allow a reasonable quality of design . You can combine them with different gray scale values - say two values . So between well-chosen colors , line widths , and gray scale values , you can help most people discriminate a good range of encodings . <p> If you follow these suggestions , I think that most people will be able to use your encodings well enough . Obviously there is no perfect solution , but the mixtures I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ multiple encodings , which is very helpful . <p> as an aside : pure black on white can also cause problems for people with dyslexia due to its high contrast . the white space can cause the visual phenomenon of " rivers " of white appearing on text passages , making it very difficult to read . so the contrast should n't be too high either <p> I agree some dyslexics will have issues with light sensitivity and brilliant white backgrounds with black text ; though being dyslexic myself one does n't  have an issue regarding text legibility under those circumstances . <p> Thus black text on a white background being suitable for all webcitzens as was previously stipulated is not always an ideal goal . Hence why many sites aided at dyslexics use a pale yellow or cream background . <p> Like Tom , I too am colour deficient ( so Dave , feel free to email the software test to me as well ) . I have strong protanomalia which means I do not see red as well as most people . <p> Approximately speaking , this means that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , pinks look grey and reds look black . Its not as simple as that because I do have *some* red vision ( Ferraris , for example , are red , plain and simple ) . <p> Jeff Veens blog ( http : //veen.com/jeff/ ) unwittingly provides an perfect example of why catering for colour deficient folks is a real problem . Jeff colours his links dark red and turns off the underlining , which for me makes the links absolutely indistinguishable from the rest of text ! <p> Here is a site that I wrote about back in march , and it does exactly what you want . It can convert pages into specific color blind schemes so you view them . I thought it was awesome then , and I use it still . <p> It was only until I took a course with IWA-HWG that I realised how awful a website could look to someone with colorblindness , and neither did I know that there were different types . I assumed that people with colorblindness only had a problem with blues I had no idea some could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three choices with a colour scheme : 1 ) do what you like regardless of how any others perceive the colour scheme 2 ) amend your colour scheme to include as many other users as possible - realising that by picking any colour scheme you may indeed be excluding somebody 3 ) give people alternative skins that they can apply according to their preferences/needs ( can be a difficult one to get past the corporate brand police ) . There is n't a simple answer , and 2 ) and 3 ) involve quite a bit of work . I like to apply the 80/20 rule loosely - this means aim for the big visual deficiencies first &amp; then try and pick off the more obscure ones - where possible or desirable - later on . Maybe your main colour scheme should be inclusive along this 80/20 rule and then try to skin in for the other more " obscure " problems . 30455 @qwx890455 30451 @qwx890451 <p> You are reading " Colour Bland : Value " , an entry posted on 29 September , 2003 , to the No 1 collection .

The table tag is n't going anywhere due to the continuing ( valid ) need for tabular data , and let 's face it , weve long worked out the bugs in tablebased design . Were only beginning to knock off the bugs of the more popular CSS configurations . <p> This is an area where standards advocates shoot themselves in the foot . " Code for the future , " we say . " Drop the tables , and you 'll never look back . Er , no , I 'm not sure why IE5 is doing that . Um . What was I saying again ?

Wellformed tables are entirely valid markup for any flavour of XHTML 1.0 . The code is always larger than it needs to be , and it looks horrible in alternative browser , yes . Anyone who has spent a bit of time gritting their teeth and figuring out how to throw together a CSSbased layout realizes that after the learning curve its a far more elegant and desirable way to build a document . But its not the only way . <p> Transitional layouts have the advantage of working in older browsers . Nobody in their right mind tests in a 3. x browser these days , but if you 're building an ecommerce site that gets even a few thousand 4. x visitors , youd better be damn sure they have a way to buy from the site .

It looked only vaguely reminiscient to my original concept , and as a design it did n't  hold up very well on its own . But the layout worked . Netscape 4 got one thing right , believe it or not : absolute positioning .

Both ways are correct . CSS positioning is a far more elegant solution , and provides more flexibility for later upgrades and alternate browsers . Tablebased design is a relic , but one that is tried and true , and remains valid markup . Both are perfectly justifiable in their own right , and will continue to be so for time to come . 
@@99593525 @3793525/ <p> The reason you 're hearing a lot about Camino all of a sudden is because it really is quite good . Ive been using it off and on for a few months now , and have just recently taken to leaving Safari unloaded all the time . <p> Sure , I miss a bunch of stuff from Safari . Hitting Cmd + a number for keyboard access to various items in my bookmark bar was a really nice feature . I was just getting used to viewing PDFs in-browser . <p> And most importantly , anyone have a Sogudi equivalent for Camino ? Weaning myself off of that one is going to be the most difficult . Typing " wiki whatever " for an instant Wikipedia search , or " g whatever " for Google , and being able to custom define these shortcuts , means quick keyboard access to search results without mucking about with multiple page loads . Its bliss . <p> Update : Turns out Sogudi-like functionality is built in to Camino . Bliss ! <p> But I do n't  miss other stuff . Safaris method @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more often than not I had to then edit out a longer path or query string . And what is up with the beachball lately ? Echoing Tim Bray , Ive experience more than my fair share of slowdowns lately over pages that should n't be slow . The snappiness of Camino is more than enough to make me overlook the rest . I 've finally got my Powerbook back . <p> For now , I 'm sold . Well see what a few months of kicking the tires does . <p> The ability to define wiki %s to look up that wikipedia article is one of the things I like most about Firefox , and I imagine Camino might have this by now as well since they 're based on the same code . Just right-click in a form field that does the search youre interested in and choose " Add a keyword for this search " <p> If Camino does n't  have this , that 's another reason I 'll stay with Firefox for now - in addition to not supporting the vital XUL-based web dev extensions such as Web Developer or FireBug . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot in Safari , try doing a Reset Safari or - less drastically - going to Preferences-&gt;Autofill , clicking Other Forms:Edit and then Remove All . This may make a difference : it seems that accumulating large quantities of autofill texts can cause Safari ( at least Safari 1.3 ) to show the beachball more frequently when rendering pages that contain forms . <p> That would n't be much of a solution for me , Angus . : ) Safaris incredible autofill ability is the killer feature that keeps me using it instead of Camino . I love how those long name and address forms just get filled like magic . <p> I do n't  think I could wean myself from David Watanabes fantastic Inquisitor plugin for Safari , which is sort of like Firefoxs search field , but with much more natural-feeling access to other search engines . Inquisitor has totally changed how I use the browser , I could n't possibly give it up ! <p> My largest peeve with Camino is that it can only remember one login and password per site . Which makes me switch to safari @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But Camino is my browser 70% of the time . <p> I 'm not sure how widespread this was known but have you tried changing the permissions on the directory where Safari stores favicons so it can not write to it ? Apparently over time is gets pretty large and Safari performance takes a hit , giving you the beach ball . I 've had the permissions fix implemented for a while so I 'm not sure if newer versions of Safari still have that problem . <p> Live Bookmarks is what kills Camino for me . I switched from Safari to FF because of the web devloper extension , then fell in love with del.icio.us/ma.gnolia and the use of live bookmarks . I could do without the web developer extension if Camino did live bookmarks . <p> The QuickTime Plugin is what 's causing the beachball of doom in Safari for me . It seems to lock up when it first begins loading a video , and only responds again after its loaded the first frame or so . Pretty annoying . <p> Some buttons ( Javascript , I think ) do n't  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Camino on http : //www.whereis.com.au . They look beautiful , but the Mac-like buttons have replaced the graphical button labels as visible in Firefox . <p> I got to say i use Camino starting 1 week ago , and is real good browser . Now i discover this plugin for Safari , Sogudi ( i understand that is build also for Camino ) and is very usefull . Thanks . I 'm wonder if is there a web developer toolbar for Camino ( i try one for Safary , but is n't working ) something similar to the one from Firefox <p> Have your tried Flock ! Its still in its infancy , but its so great , I switched over immediately . Goodbye every one else . Its based off of Firefox , but it has del.icio.us &amp; shadow bookmarks built in for those who like to synch on multiple computers . It has a photo browser that connects with your Flickr .. and then get this . It has blogging tools that will not only post your blog , but will let you post your flickr pictures to your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , most Firefox extensions work on it .

I do n't  understand because my server is dedicated and I manage it by myself and the ftp user has full rights on this directory . <p> One thing I cant ( under ) stand about Camino and Firefox is the way they render my virtual scrollwheel useless . I have UControl installed and configured to scroll vertically when I press " control " + " option " and the mousebutton . <p> Firefox , however , goes back or forth in history instead of scrolling , and Camino zooms the page Im viewing . That 's so annoying . If I want to go back and forth I 'll use the " back " - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever want to zoom a page , really .

@@99593526 @3793526/ <p> Flickr added the ability to geotag your photos the other day . Being a big time map geek , I 'm all over this one . <p> Two nights and 900 photos later , all but a few are now mapped . ( As with all things Flickr , they made it easy enough to become a compulsion . ) I have a few notes and a couple of suggestions . <p> First off , though this was perhaps an obvious move to many , I 'm still thrilled that its here . Flickrs implementation is nice and intuitive , and works mostly the way I 'd have hoped . Mapped out photo locations is nice extra bit of metadata that will no doubt change how I view my photo archives . <p> Integrating Yahoo Maps was an obvious move , given the corporate overlord just happened to have a ready-to-go mapping tool on hand . But less-obviously , its a move that will get Flickrs users more familiar with Yahoos map offering , which is a nice win for the company . The problem is , compared to Google Maps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Google is faster and feels more responsive , its keyboard shortcuts work better , and its data feels more complete . The data issue is a relative one , as Yahoo is more broadly comprehensive with at least major highways showing up for most countries , but it falls down on the fine details . ( No street maps of London , for heavens sake . ) Over time this is sure to change , but in stark contrast with Google Maps , Yahoo maps is a tad frustrating . ( To be fair , they acknowlege it themselves . ) <p> Then there 's the privacy issue . Sure , before allowing you to geotag your own photos , Flickr gives you a nice little warning that you 're about to do something that could have repercussions . But that only helps you avoid do something silly like give away your street address by posting a cluster of photos from inside your apartment . What about other people using your name as a tag on geotagged photos ? There are some huge implications here that are going to make a lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this is in no way realtime , but were bound to see some interesting discussion about this as people catch on . <p> The only thing that 's really bugging me though , is the way photos have been paged . A widget lives up in the top left corner that allows you to navigate through various " pages " of location-mapped photos . There are a few things going on here that might be a little subtle , and I 'm going to make a few assumptions , so bear with me . <p> Let 's take it for granted that there are simply too many results to show on the map at any given time . This may be more true for some places than others , but in general , with 2+ million geotagged photos so far , well assume its an issue . Representing that many photos on a map of the earth just is n't going to work , you have to break it down into chunks . <p> A Flickr photostream runs in reverse chronological order , with newest photos at the top . A Flickr maps pages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not the same . <p> The solution they 've hit on is to break down the photos chronologically into separate " pages " , almost exactly the same way your average photostream is broken down . But the disconnect comes with the fact that dots on a map do n't  indicate chronology the same way photos in a linear stream do . It took me a lot of second-guessing to figure out quite what was going on here , and even now that I know , I still feel a sense of disorientation when I know there are many more photos in a location than are currently being shown . The load time in between when I click on the pager control and when the map actually updates is n't helping matters either . <p> Recognizing the need to break photos down into more digestible chunks , I can see two possible ways of coming at this problem . The first is the way theyve already done it . The second takes into account other inherent metadata that 's not immediately obvious , the cluster phenomenon . Popular places will contain clusters of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scattering of individual pictures here and there . <p> Instead of filtering by time the photos were taken , I suspect a more useful filter would be a popularity threshold where the default behaviour is to only show locations with large amounts of photos ( large relative to the total number of photos within that area ) , but allow the user to manually change that filter . At a glance , I 'd be able to tell which spots are hottest , and if I wish I can filter out those and look for the less-travelled paths . And the data that would drive this already exists , given that these number show up on the map as-is , they 're just not the main driving force behind the existing filtration method . <p> here 's a pair of sequences , this first one showing a few pages of the chronological breakdown as it exists at the moment . <p> This other one is a mockup for how a cluster breakdown might look . The latter is just my own thinking , but I sure hope to see something similar in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poor quality and very limited detail of the Yahoo maps makes the Geotagging almost useless for use here in the UK . <p> I wanted to geotag some photos that were taken in Wardour Street London ( a well known street in a major city ) and was amazed that Yahoo maps had no street names at all for London and if I zoomed in to the level I could with Google maps I just got a grey screen . <p> Add me to the list of under-whelmed UK users . Its rendered near-useless by a terrible lack of road detail , even in the cities . What 's more , the quality of aerial photography is so far below that of Google that you cant identify things by hand ; even when searching by postal code , I ca n't be sure that the map is focused in the right place . Then to top it off , the drag and and drop performance on my iBook G4 was too painful to consider tagging lots of photos in one sitting . <p> A Flickr+Google Maps mash-up beckons I think . Maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if someone with the skills and inclination is present . <p> There is no batch edit for locations using lattitude &amp; longitude sets : - ( That really is a bummer for someone from India . I travel around a bit with my GPS unit and always store locations where my photos are taken . The cool thing is that individual photos can be added the coordinates and they do pop up in the map automatically ( no need to drag photos to the map ) , but no batch edit . <p> ( I also use Flickr Uploaded . Even if there is an update to that utility with the batch adding of geotagging it will be great ) <p> Yahoos sat photos are a bit on the aged side - my house , which was built 6 years ago , does n't  even exist on there . The photo was taken at least 7 years ago , probably closer to 10 years ago . Whereas the Google sat photo of my area is about 2 and a half years old . <p> Ive been having fun with geotagging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pretty cool feature . <p> You 're right the paginating of the photos on the map is very irritating . I think they should display spots for all of ones photos on ones own map at the same time . I know they did this to perhaps avoid having to launch all those thumbnail images into the mappage at once , but I think they could avoid that by loading the thumbnails for a particular pinpoint only when one clicks on the pinpoint <p> I blogged a bit about this as well , and I also noted that its irritating that they hide the long/lat geocodes within the page code ( in microformat , as one previously mentioned ) . <p> Still , its a very , very strong implementation otherwise , and well worth using IMHO . <p> I am big into maps to I am glad that Flickr keeps adding things to it service I was worried with Yahoo buying them it was going to take away from new stuff coming out , but I still love Google maps and hope to see something similiar for it soon .

This could very well end up being a preview of some of the first applications that will be officially available once the SDK is released . <p> My list below is n't comprehensive by any means ; these are just some of the apps I think deserve mention due to their utility or polish . There 's a lot of crap to wade through already , so I think its worth calling out some of the gems . All these are available directly from Installer.app , provided you have also installed Community Sources . <p> The images above link to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and all of the existing iPhone Screenshot utilities do n't  seem to be working for me anymore . So pardon the grainy photos . <h> Apollo <p> There are a few native IM clients out at the moment , and obviously Meebo works just fine too . But I 'm finding none of the native clients thus far are any good , or even good enough . Apollo is the one Ive been using occasionally when I need IM on my phone , but it still needs a lot of work . Active development stopped back in October , with the developers stating they 're focusing on an official version once the SDK is released , so this may turn out to be one of the first official IM clients for the iPhone . Hopefully it will have seen some massive updates in the interim . <p> Killer feature : IM over EDGE . Its not great for long chat sessions , but damn if it is n't useful to have the ability to ask an IM contact a quick question when out and about . ( Terrible video of Apollo in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but polished to a shiny finish . FiveDice is one of the few games worth having thus far , in my opinion . <h> iAno <p> Almost more of a proof of concept than a useful app at this point , iAno is still fun . Its a piano simulator that crams a full octave on screen at once , and can play any note between C3 on the low end and C7 on the high end . What makes iAno stand out is its use of Multi-touch ; chords are possible , you can play three notes at the same time . here 's a video of iAno in action , and you 've probably already seen it on the top phone in the iBand video going around recently . If they end up adding a sequencer to the app , I 'd expect to start seeing rather a lot of iPhone-generated music in the future . <h> iMatrix <p> My screenshot above is mostly useless , as the entire point of iMatrix is what the iPhones camera sees and I was n't able to demo that . What it does is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across a QR Code or other 2D code , you take a quick snapshot of it with the phone . Then iMatrix will process the data contained within , and automatically ( with your permission ) use the data to open a URL in Safari , add a contact to your address book , dial a phone number , or a few other actions . <p> Second , its able to generate 2D codes on the screen of the phone that can be read with scanners . Some of the applications this opens up : virtual ticketing , coupons , identifaction , and other purposes where simple authentication or data exchange is useful . <p> The idea of 2D codes is n't unique to this application by any means , they 've been around for over a decade . They 're not common in North America yet , but given time and more devices that are able to process them , it seems like momentums building . They may be as common as URLs in a few years . here 's a poorly-narrated video of iMatrix contact exchange in action . <h> iSolitaire <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ? This particular version just happens to look great , and makes fine use of the touch screen for dragging cards around . If its not one of the first official solitaire apps , I 'll be very surprised . <h> Labyrinth <p> You know the classic wooden labyrinth puzzles ? Yeah , its just like those . Using the accelerometer , Labyrinth has you tilt the entire phone to guide the ball into the hole . It makes for a great demo of what having accelerometers in these devices can get you . Unlike most of the other apps in this list , Labyrinth is a demo ; there 's a full version available for purchase . The iPhone software market has already begun . <h> Photoboard <p> Remember that wow feeling after watching Jeff Hans TED demo of a multi touch interface a few years back ? Photoboard brings a bit of that to the iPhone/iPod Touch with its rotation and zoom ability . Its a fairly simple toy at this point , akin to a basic lightboard for photos . You pull in photos from your devices library @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ zoom in and out , and layer them on the screen . Its cramped on the small screen , does n't  save your setup when exiting , and is n't really altogether useful yet , but its a great tech demo and shows promise for what might be possible in the future . here 's a video of Photoboard in use . <h> Sketches <p> A basic note-taking and sketching app , Sketches has a few basic drawing tools that turn your finger into a pencil . You can import photos from your library or the iPhones camera and use them as a canvas , save your creations , email them , etc . Given the limitations of using your finger as an imprecise stylus , this feels like the perfect mix of basic utility without going too far into more advanced and harder to use features . There may be apps in the future that allow more complex image editing on the iPhone , but right now this seems like the furthest you 'd want to go . <p> Plus , to erase the image ? You just shake the device . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looks like an Etch-a-Sketch . here 's a video about using Sketches tools . <h> Others <p> This is just scratching the surface ; it seems like every week there are a handful of new ones worth keeping . A few more notable applications : <p> Categories <p> This is a recent discovery ; it allows for folder/group creation on the iPhone/iPods home screen . You choose an icon for the folder , then drag a few apps into it . To get at them later from the home screen , you tap the group , then a new menu pops up with those icons . Pretty much as you 'd expect . <p> weDict <p> A reusable dictionary/lookup app . If I get it , and I 'm not 100% sure I do , you plug in various installable dictionaries , and then use the application to search them . Right now I have French &gt; English and English &gt; French dictionaries , and if I look up " neige " it tells me that the French &gt; English dictionary thinks that word means " snow " . <p> Books <p> A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 've seen some public domain titles available for install , and a few newer CC-licensed works , like Cory Doctorows books . <p> Evolution RGB <p> This is a little toy/game thing that does n't  make any sense at all when it first loads . In a nutshell , you have pre-defined elements like fire , water , plant , clay etc . You draw them onto the screen , then watch water interact with fire , fire interact with plant , etc . Its generative like the old-school evolution game from decades past , and setting up some opposing elements and watching them interact can be vaguely hypnotic . This is the best video I could find that demonstrates how it works . It wo n't win any beauty contests , but its really worth taking a look . <p> The most important thing I learned from installing iPhone apps over the last several months is how few of them I actually need . Zero at the least three at the most . There just is n't a whole lot the iPhone does n't  already do that I 'd want it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the only two holes for me . <p> Oh yeah . Its hard to disagree with that . I 've uninstalled plenty more than I 've installed , and many of them sit there without being used . <p> I would n't even go so far as to say any of the above are " must-have " , but iMatrix strikes me as one with legs , and I think Sketches is handy to have around . <p> It may be the biggest effect from the SDK will be a boost in overall quality ; right now it has to be tough to justify building a tight , polished app for a strictly unofficial environment . Once Apple has given their blessing , I can see a lot more useful apps being developed . <p> Good points , Dave . I 'd like to add similar ( well written and polished up ) apps to your list if I may . <p> * " MobileScrobbler " is damn helpful when you have an account on Last.fm . It allows your device to automatically scrobble listened tracks to database ( via WiFi or EDGE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gateway for Last.fm 's kick-ass radio .

Plenty of ligatures to keep typofetishists happy . <p> Caveat emptor though . Babelfish seems to indicate that the updated note on the Day Roman page casts doubt on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jumping out in particular . As is the case with any resource available for free on the internet , it ca n't be a bad idea to research the origins yourself before committing to using them in your commercial work . <p> And hey , nothings wrong with paying for your type . Even if you 're not looking to shell out a few hundred for an OpenType family with a dozen variants from a major foundry , there are plenty of independent font designers out there . <p> Mark Simonsons new Proxima Nova is off to a great start , but his back catalogue is not to be missed either . P-Type Publications has released a couple of Indie Fonts collections , which feature samplings from your favourite independent foundaries like Test Pilot Collective and P22 . And for the whimsical , do n't  miss Robot Johnny and Larabie . ( I 've had Robot Johnnys Girls Are Weird installed for , like , years and years . ) <p> Update : Caveat indeed . Day Roman aside , other fonts in the license-free collection actually impose non-commercial licenses , meaning you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use the list with discretion . Again , make darn sure you know the origin of the free resource you found online before using it in your own work . <p> Introducing new fonts is just big tease to us web designers . Its like when my dog sees me eating a piece of chocolate , and he knows he wo n't get to partake . I see those fonts and think how great they would look on a site , but in the next breath I 'm trying to convince myself that verdana and georgia really are very attractive fonts. 
@@99593529 @3793529/ <p> While I tend to write off the Search Engine Optimization field as an ethical quagmire where the bad are out to pollute the common waters for their own gain , and the good are little more than technically-savvy marketers , there 's clearly an amount of science and depth to it that I do n't  understand . <p> Case in point , a recent demonstration of its effectiveness by hijacking the top 5 search results in Google for the term " five seo excuses " to form a top 5 list . And because the order is so precise , the URLs spell out an extra little message . The buzz its generating means you 're too late to observe the effects first-hand , but I can vouch for the accuracy of the screen shot in the prior-linked post . <p> Impressive demo to be sure . It shows that SEO techniques have evolved into a formidable tool that 's of obvious value to many businesses . ( I 'm still glad that 's not what I do to put food on the table , though . ) <p> Such stunts , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point that Google is vulnerable and can be hacked to present irrelevant content . If someone was *really* trying to find information about the top five SEO excuses , four of those top five results are irrelevant duplicates which do not help solve the searchers problem . <p> And the near-instant destruction of the top five list as soon as it was reported on and linked by other sources proves that Google still works . <p> Self-correction . I had n't  yet actually visited any of the articles when I made the first comment , and I incorrectly assumed them to be five instances of a single article outlining all five excuses . As it turns out , each article briefly states a single excuse in somewhat poorly-written marketspeak plus a dose of fallacious reasoning . Hence , NONE of the five original articles is a useful result when searching for information about " five seo excuses " . <p> I think google is going to face more and more challanges . If they make their algo so complex that only huge sites make it to the top - then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ result is less relevent results on smaller items . Eventually even though " google " has become a verb , people will begin to use the other search engines . <p> I have already seen with my home town , searching for most city keyphrases ( for example " Ann Arbor hair salon " simply returns nothing but lists of Hair Salons and it is nearly impossible to find a webpage of an actual salon . I end up having to sort and click through 4-5 pages just to find one . <p> That is not relevant results in my opinion . <p> Google needs to accept that pages can be optimized , and find better ways to combat spam that does n't  make anything but " information hubs " rank poorly . <p> SEO should never have become an " industry " in the first place . Trying to manipulate your ranking irrespective of the quality of your content just makes search more useless . <p> At best , SEO should consist of html best-practices and legitimate partnerships with like-minded sites . Unfortunately , shameless profiteers like Virante are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a buck . <p> Its good to see Google has removed these spam listings ( although who searches for such a bullshit query as " five seo excuses " ? ) . <p> " Trying to manipulate your ranking irrespective of the quality of your content just makes search more useless . " <p> I see it at a different light . At this point in time search engines display results that DO NT represent which sites have the most quality content . <p> Again - large information hubs tend to get to the top fairly easily due to googles algo . Smaller - yet still extremely relevent sites often are not visible at all simply because there are not a whole lot of reasons for other sites to link to them . <p> For example , a site I work for now is a small self storage company . They do n't  have great search engine rankings because there simply is n't a good reason for 100s of sites to be linking to them . <p> The large chains show up higher because they have nation wide links - even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than my clients . <p> 1 . They picked a phrase for which there were very few results . ( That 's how they got to the top ) 2. set up the pages to link to each other in a way so that each had one more link pointing to it than the next . ( That explains the order ) 3 . Got some advertising zeromillion.com to each page with the same link phrase : " Five SEO Excuses " . ( That 's why the pages show up for that query ) <p> The reason for it seems to be just a marketing gimmick , albeit a successful one , to get people talking about it and linking to them , thus increasing their own page rank , and making people think they 're not evil and that SEO really works . <p> Googles search algorithm can find local search results for self storage just fine . I typed in " self storage &amp; Chapel Hill " and Google gave me a whole list of local self storage joints . <p> Now , if one of these local Chapel Hill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " self-storage " even though they are n't  as far reaching as other national chains , that would be polluting search results IMO . <p> The large nation chains are #1 on the Google results because they 're the largest and most likely to be found nationwide . If you SEOd a local self-storage joint to #1 on the term " self-storage " , what use would that be to me if I lived elseware ? <p> Now , if Google did more auto-detection of location and offered local results above national results , that would be fine . But that 's Googles concern , not yours . By promoting locally-relevant sites over nationally-relevant sites you 're polluting the results for the bulk of Googles audience . <p> I agree .. top 5 seo excuses is definitley not a well known phrase but its interesting how they manipulated Google to link them up in order looking at the code , not surprisingly it looks like the pages are dictated in order by use of descending h1-h5 tags . We 've all known using semantically correct markup helps in google but this is an interesting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your competitors are all using h1 tags to title their content ( as they should ) . <p> My apologies for the harsh words on my blog . I posted a rudimentary post ( still in the flame stages ) for no other reason than I was heading to eat dinner and wanted to preserve the post . It was n't intended for public consumption ( nobody actually reads my blog ) . Embarrassingly , I did not expect anyone to actually read the post before I could get back , soften it , flesh it out , and actually read over at least once what I 'd typed in a flurry . I meant no disrespect towards you . <p> Im headed out for a bit again right now , I 'll revamp my post so its sane later this evening : ) . <p> " I 'm still glad that 's not what I do to put food on the table , though . " <p> True words . And although being Google-aware is part of running a large website , I 'm also glad that the firm I work for does not have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ model ! - " that relies mostly on top Google rankings . <p> Your last sentence hits the nail on the head . Easily breakable parlour trick or no , it underscores how easy it is to mess with the system , not to mention how hard it is to keep promised rankings intact . <p> This is also why I only use Google to find general reference information , like how to fix ( yet another ) script I 've broken . <p> What can be done for legitimate sites ? Are we going to be forced to use those horrible tactics ? I was in a forum the other day talking about how easy it is to spam . And as a demonstration , one member posted about 300 words relating to car rentals in Halifax . He then created a link from the forum to his site . Not only did that forum page become #1 for the term , but his site also moved up in the listings . I hate to admit it , but I may start using these tactics . ( I hang my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impressive , in fact its more worrying it think that all my ( I would say ) Ethical SEO work can still be stomped on by hacking a search engine . Its 2006 surely Google should have sorted it out by now ! <p> Thank you for all of your comments on this project , I did however want to respond to some of the comments <p> 1 . Ethics I did want to point out some of the positives that come out of the search industry . For example , please take a moment to visit PoundPrivacy.org , to look at our campaign to create a privacy standard for all search engines . There truly are magnitudes of difference between professional SEOs and that guy down the street who claims to do SEO . <p> 2 . Cheap Parlour Trick , Not Impressive On the contrary , when we ran the project , you would have noticed that the order did not occur in Yahoo or MSN . The search engine algorithms vary substantially enough that nailing down the exact idiosyncracies to secure the correct order of 5 pages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3 . Virante.com is in Tables No excuses here , we have since relaunched the site . <p> 4 . SEO should not be an industry Let 's say that no SEO occurred at all . Instead , people wrote good HTML and likeminded sites linked to them . Who would win ? Companies with multiple web sites , and big companies who are able to advertise outside the web , getting other individuals ( inevitably a few of whom are likeminded webmasters ) to visit the site and link to them . SEO is one of the few advertising methods left in the world that can be successfully executed by small businesses at a reasonable price . 
@@99593530 @3793530/ <h> Glyphs <p> July 25 , 2005 11AM PST <p> Oh , the fun to be had with Unicode . <p> Unicode , for those still unfamiliar , is a universal character encoding standard , jointly developed by a consortium with dozens of corporate and individual members around the world . The Unicode character set currently tops out at over 70,000 characters , and contains character sets from around the world , in both modern and ancient forms . <p> A bit more background follows , and then some usage analysis . Interspersed throughout this article are various Unicode characters ; its highly unlikely that your browser/OS knows what to do with all of them . So unless you 're running Safari , click on any set to view an image-based equivalent ( which is a screenshot of how they actually do render in Safari ) . <p> Although Unicode is meant for characters , the term ' character ' appears to be used rather loosely . The scope of Unicode is quite broad : <p> Unicode covers all the characters for all the writing systems of the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , punctuations , and many other characters used in writing text . The Unicode Standard is intended to support the needs of all types of users , whether in business or academia , using mainstream or minority scripts . <p> If you 've never opened a character selection utility , there are a whole bunch of goodies waiting to be discovered . Both Mac OS X and Windows have useful utilities that allow you to get at the extended characters you wo n't find on the average keyboard . Windows has the Character Map ( All Programs ? Accessories ? System Tools ? Character Map ) while OS X has the more functional and comprehensive Character Palette ( System Preferences ? International ? Input Menu ? Character Palette ) . Both of these will enable you to browse around the higher Unicode characters that one normally ca n't get at directly from the average keyboard . <p> Strange decoration : &amp;#x2104 ; &amp;#x2763 ; &amp;#x1D1E ; &amp;#x211F ; and &amp;#x210B ; <p> Given the current state of internationalization amongst modern operating systems and browsers , we 're coming close to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the web . The issues are similar to those of specfying typefaces for a browser : the user 's system must be able to render the character in question . <p> The biggest advantage I can see , aside from the obvious foreign language support , is the ability to include pictographs and icons within a document , without having to send an image over the wire . A little CSS styling means they can be set to any size , without consuming any more bandwidth , so the visual opportunities are promising . <p> Though , the biggest caveat is that any character you choose must have a representative glyph ( the character pictograph itself ) in the font you 're displaying it with . It 's unlikely that we 'll ever be able to rely on a specific glyph/font combination being present on the computers of every user . It 's also pretty much a given that the average typeface simply wo n't have glyphs for all 70,000+ characters , considering the work that goes into producing even a basic latin character set . We 're lucky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -- Verdana , Georgia , Arial , etc. -- have a larger number of glyphs designed than an average font ( thank you , Microsoft ) . <p> Browsers are not equal in their rendering , unfortunately . This article was composed while testing in Safari , and looks absolutely great . Any other browser , including Firefox , does n't . I ca n't even begin to speculate why this is , as I had assumed Unicode character assignment occured on the operating system level . Suffice it to say , all browsers are not equal when it comes to rendering advanced Unicode characters . <p> Although it 's probably easier and more reliable to embed these in an image for now , if you pay attention to the character sets and font combinations , it 's possible to render them as text within a browser . Once you have a Unicode number ( which you can find in your character viewer of choice ) you 've got enough to start playing . There are at least three ways to include them as character data , and likely more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into your markup from the character viewer . Make sure your site uses a Unicode encoding like UTF-8 . ( Although this is true for all three options in this list . ) <p> As an escaped character entity in your markup , using the NNNN ; format ( for example , &amp;#x203A ; ) where NNNN is the Unicode number ( can be less than 4 digits , e.g. &amp;#xB7 ; ) ( Unicode Character Lookup ) <p> As generated content via your CSS , using the : before and : after pseudoselectors and the " NNNN " format . ( eg. li:before content : " 203A " ; <p> It might be nice to have a reference sheet with a bunch of reliable cross-browser glyphs that work today , were anyone up to experimenting .

@@99593531 @3793531/ <p> A new Digital Web Interview with yours truly is now live , conducted by Craig Saila . Plenty of thoughts await on time management , design influences , WaSP efforts , and more on that Garden thing . And so as not to leave anyone hanging , I briefly tell the story Ive always wanted to . <p> Comments open . Feel free to continue the interview here , if you 've got any further questions . <p> Keith : Thanks , glad you enjoyed . To answer : if there 's anything the past 40 years have proved , its that even the best technology wont be replacing humans for a long , long time . Spontaneity , creativity , and independent thought are anything but a commodity . <p> The software will continue to change , and in 10 years hand-coding might be a historical curiosity ( though , if I had to predict , I 'd say that 's not likely ) . Intricately wrapping my ability around a practice that may not last does n't  seem prudent ; so I retain the ability to adapt and stay flexible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make todays skills obsolete ? Some . Nobody programs in COBOL anymore , but there are plenty of people making a good living off programming in general . Nobody sets type in metal anymore , but designers are still making decent money . Maybe in 10 years we wo n't need to hand-code , but all the other skills that go along with creating a web site will be more relevant than ever . <p> What 's most important then is keeping your skills fresh . But that 's just good sense in any profession . <p> I found myself identifying with you and asking myself a lot of the same questions you did early on . Great Interview its kind of nice to know that people you look to for help and inspiration started in the same place you did at one time . <p> I actually moved from Vancouver to play baseball in the US and I 'm not sure if you meant to say " batting a thousand " - batting a hundred means you are 1 for 10 . <p> I interned at Boeing for a few summers as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were trying to do and that is convert their existing intranet infrastructure over to this new portal software Plumtree . Their vision would be that by using this system , it in essence would cost less and mean that Web Developers would n't be necessary because it is basically this huge content managment system . Whether this is in fact feasible , is open to debate . <p> Managers would no longer need to keep a " web presence " on the corporate intranet because they would have a portal presence that they could easily configure and manage . <p> I 'm not saying that this is going to happen towards the internet but it is one way that advances in technology are costing designers and developers jobs , other than offshoring . <p> Great interview . I cant wait to see the new brightcreative site . Judging by your past work , it should be a stunner . <p> One nit to pick : <p> " So far though , I 'm batting a hundred ; I have n't been able to do it . I 'm not convinced that 's a bad thing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I think you were shooting for 1000. ; - ) <p> And on the commoditization of web development , I have shared similar thoughts for quite some time . When I first started writing CGIs in 1995 in perl , I assumed at the time that ALL of this stuff would be automated within five years . There are several CMS products out there that come close to achieving this goal , but the best work is still done by hand . I think there will be a place for us in the future for quite some time to come . Dreamweaver might make things easier , but skilled experts will always be in demand . <p> re : batting a hundred . Whoops . I should just stick to the hockey analogies <p> Tim : Thanks for sharing the experience . Content management systems generally aim to cut out the web developer from anything beyond initial site development . In a lot of cases , this is win-win because no one likes attending to the little maintenance jobs . I have n't yet heard of a shop bringing in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instead they re-focus on bringing in new development . <p> Hey Dave , the inteview was great . I really had a pleasure editing it . When I was first reading it I had wondered a bit more about your views on the future of Web design and development . <p> You say , " The technology is going to continue to change , and to a certain degree itll become commoditized . Once you have Dreamweaver spitting out valid XHTML that works with the major databases and CMSs out of the box , a lot of todays Web development market will drop off . " <p> I was wondering if you could elaborate on that a bit . I 've often thought about the same thing and what I 'll be doing in 10 years and as far as I can figure , while I think things will be drastically different , there will still be a place for Web design . <p> It might be something totally different , but I think itll still be here . I mean things are drastically different than they were 10 years ago , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Anyway , what do you think ? Will technology eventually make our current jobs obsolete ? Also , where do you think us Web designers will end up where will our skills take us ? <p> When you release your 3 columns css driven feat - please let me know . I would say - you have probably achieve what were starving to see the end of hacks to work around unequal content divs to have a well structure stable feel . <p> Carole : for sure . I would n't say mine is a magic bullet , because it is somewhat hackish I used the faux column trick LONG ... ) along with a liberal use of CSS hacks but it definitely works . <p> Dave you expressed a love for pure design , citing inspiration from places like K10K . But Craig did n't  touch on the issue of Macromedia Flash . What are your thoughts on this medium ? Though it may throw standards and accessibility out the window , there 's no denying the richness of Flash and the amazing things you can do with it as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Standards , pah . I do n't  want my creativity to be limited . " And while your zen garden project obviously demonstrates just how much css can do , it is still all fairly limited compared to some of the Flash sites out there . <p> Is Flash evil ? Will we end up with two internets , the accessible network and the Flash sites ? Will future versions of CSS ever be able to come close to what Flash does today . <p> Is it necessary ? Maybe not . Do clients love it ? Of course . Does it boost the user experience ? I think so . Its just all a little more alive and fun to navigate and explore . Do n't  you think ? Not looking at it from a standards-nazi , but as an everyday user who wants to be impressed . <p> Is it possible to pull something like this off with CSS today ? I do n't  think so . I 'm curious as to whether you think it will be one day . <p> Matt Flash used properly is great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be hard-pressed to find a better tool . Mini-animations embedded in an otherwise HTML-driven page are generally harmless , and sometimes quite interesting . I love what Todd Dominey did for the PGA Championship http : **35;1716;TOOLONG <p> For entire web site interfaces ? Well , to pull that off you have to be offering me something I cant get from HTML/CSS . Better mouseovers do n't  justify the accessibility hit in my mind . An immersive , experiential environment might count , but I 'd have to want it to put up with it . There are too many other sources I can turn to if you 've done a bad job , and I generally will . I 'd give users enough credit to realize I 'm not alone in thinking this way . <p> Incidentally , I do n't  have Flash plugged into Firebird on my PC . If I hit a site that needs it , I have to consciously load a new browser . I 'll do this maybe two or three times out of ten . I quite like browsing this way .

@@99593533 @3793533/ <p> The paradigm continues today . Every good web design book/site will tell you that using the words click here should be avoided at all costs , and they have been since the beginning of the web . <p> The hyperlink interface is wellestablished and easy to use : if you hover your mouse over a link , the cursor will change , indicating that this can indeed be clicked . This is a simple , yet effective system that rarely needs to be improved . <p> Why then do many designers continue to direct users to click on these links ? The simple reason is that the call to action appeals to marketing types . A simple standalone image that is n't an obvious link will get overlooked . Anything not garnering traffic is bad ; we cant rely on people to find what they want , we must tell them what they should have . <p> Havent we been here though ?

Custom scripts are not available in every budget , and in many cases the source material is less than optimal for the end use .

@@99593535 @3793535/ <p> You want to use smart quotes " " instead of double primes " " in your work . Time to fire up Windows Character Map and hunt for the proper quote . Or alternatively you could build a cheat sheet of the ALT-0147/0148 keyboard combinations . The Mac OS allows a slightly easier method with Option- and Option- , and provides further keyboard shortcuts for many of the varied typographical items . <p> But inconveniences of computer-based typographical frills aside , were just scratching the surface . The Unicode standard allows for over 65,000 possible characters , which covers most of the major world languages . Try accessing these characters in standard applications like Word or Photoshop though . <h> why would you want to ? <p> There are times when an English-speaking designer is asked to work with type of a different language . Its impratical and expensive for the designer to install a Chinese license of their operating system and a Chinese version of their authoring software to create a series of Big5 GIFs for a single web site , and they should n't have to . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Style , Robert Bringhurst suggests an approach for typographical decoration that could theoretically work for some foreign characters as well . He recommends re-mapping your keyboard for various ALT+n and Option/CTRL+n key combinations to insert special characters into your work . While a great idea in theory , it breaks down in two important ways : software to easily re-map a keyboard any way you wish does n't  seem to exist , and if it did , most of the possible Option/CTRL and ALT key-combinations are already assigned as shortcuts in the authoring software . <h> what i want to see <p> Since most major software manufacturers approach international language support as an afterthought , an add-on application that has considerably more power than Windows Character Map is needed . I want a program that allows me to map my keyboard to input any character with any key-stroke I choose . I need it to offer alternate mappings for different languages , that can be switched as easily as selecting my choice from a drop down . It also needs to offer an on-screen keyboard since I 'm not going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> This program will only be as good as the software it inputs to , though . Microsoft seems to be on the right track , as most of their programs are quite good at displaying foreign characters if the proper language packs are installed . But the other major software manufacturers , especially graphic design software , need to approach this less as a value-added feature and more as built-in functionality . <p> A lot of things have to change to make this happen , and I do n't  see many steps in this direction . Unfortunately , hacks and work-arounds like screenshots and bitmapped characters are going to have to remain the standard for the foreseeable future . 30454 @qwx890454 30455 @qwx890455 30451 @qwx890451 <p> You are reading " Tricky Characters " , an entry posted on 20 November , 2002 , to the Pods collection .

@@99593536 @3793536/ <p> Stuart Robinson recently showed us a use of the : hover pseudoclass on arbitrary elements to highlight all links in a given paragraph .

My approach has come from the opposite direction , allowing the user to scan without interaction , but making it easier to do so given a bit of input . Take a look . Nothing groundbreaking here , but its another approach to the same concept . <p> And in a bit of timely news , AOL , todays owner of Netscape , has decided to shake hands and call it a draw in their ongoing suit against Microsoft .

Further improvements to IE will require enhancements to the underlying OS .

@@99593538 @3793538/ <p> A certain Mr. Storey has made the suggestion that I turn this photo into a Christmas card . Given the relative popularity , its not a bad idea , I could get a few sets of a dozen done up and offer them for sale around these parts . Might be worth a shot I 'm just afraid its too late for this year . <p> Printing and shipping mean probably a week or so before I 'd have something in my hands , and if I decided to sell them , add an extra week of shipping out from here . That takes us to mid-December , and that 's probably just way too late for Christmas cards . <p> So I 'll pose the question to all of you should I bother this year ? I 'm wondering who would be interested in a set of 12 cards with that photo ( no text , blank interior , thick glossy stock ) , and if the timing is a problem . Perhaps its possible that people would just order them anyway and use them next year if it came to that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And if anyone has any suggestions for printers that could turn this around in a hurry , I 'm all ears . <p> Dave , have you thought about CafePress ? Sales could start up now , printing on demand , and all you have to do is upload the pics and advertise . I have thought about using it this season for some shirt designs . <p> I think CafePress is probably your best bet for getting the cards out this Christmas . For next year , though , you might check with Tim at Full Chord Press1 about printing the cardshis stock is great , and he s a helpful guy . ( His New Years cards are hilarious to boot ! ) <p> While CafePress might be the quick easy way of getting them out there , the catch is that the base price for 6 cards is $10.99 , with no secondary option for 12 . That strikes me as a little steep , considering I really ca n't check the quality myself . <p> Hmm . This might have to wait till next year when I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say go for it with the cards but there 's a better alternative to CafePress . Try out Zazzle ( http : //www.zazzle.com ) . Its completely free to sign up and post as much as you want . The quality is fantastic and you can allow others to personalize their cards if you offer greeting cards . Ive been using them for years and their quality is top-notch . Plus , they ship very quickly at no extra charge . <p> Zazzle is very easy to use and a wonderful service that has always treated me well . Try them out . Its free after all . : ) <p> Dave , just get one of the good digital printers here in Vancouver to print them . Should only take a couple of days if you send them well-prepared PDF files .

I imagine I know some people who would want some if they were available . It does seem a bit late to be getting them out for this Christmas , but I know some people like getting next years stuff early if there 's a good opportunity . <p> Love the photo , but i would also be inclined to wait to make sure the quality was what you wanted . If you do n't  have enough photos of your own by next year to make a boxed set of 6 different photos , maybe get with some other people for photo contributions ?

@@99593539 @3793539/ <p> here 's one for any fellow countrymen who intend to work with companies in the United States . <p> Live in Canada ? Run a small web design studio or development business ? Looking to work with a company based in the US ? Got hit with IRS paperwork ? There 's good news . <p> First and foremost though , the legal stuff : I am not a lawyer , this can not be construed as legal advice , and I cant guarantee the accuracy of these statements . This is for informational purposes only . You 'll want to consult with a lawyer who specializes in US tax law to analyze your own situation , as there are bound to be various specifics that need the attention of a professional . If printed , this article must be printed in its entirety and feature this notice . <p> As the owner of a small Canadian design studio , I frequently take on contracts with US-based businesses . The flow of money across the border is obviously important to the governments involved , as its taxable income . I 've consulted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Im on solid legal ground , and I 'm simply passing on what I 've been able to interpret about what I found out during these consultations . Again , its simply my interpretation , not genuine legal advice . ( Yes , its tricky to know when to quit with the disclaimers ) <p> When initiating a new contract , the foreign company I 'm working with usually passes along paperwork that needs to be completed before any payment can be issued . The larger the company , the more likely it is to happen . The paperwork usually consists of an IRS form W8-BEN ( PDF link ) , along with any internal forms their accounting department requires . The latter are for the companys own records , and a necessary hoop to jump through . What interests us here is the W8-BEN . This is where it gets tricky . <p> The accounting department is usually working on the basis of local tax laws , whereas in your case , if you 're working on Canadian soil , those laws may not apply . ( The laws are different for Canadian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet to figure out how THAT works . ) The important point to note here is that the international US-Canada tax treaty supersedes any local law where there 's overlap or potential conflict . Getting your hands on a copy , and then deciphering it , though , is no easy task . Again for information purposes only , here 's an online version which may or may not be accurate . If you can find all the articles that apply to you , and then actually understand their implications , you 'll be fine . Unfortunately , for pretty much all of us who did n't  study law in school , doing so means hiring a lawyer . <p> Essentially , the Article relevant to the situation in which you and I find ourselves is Article VII . When working for hire , you 're on the hook for paying taxes only to the country in which you reside . Sorry , that does mean your US income is taxable by the Canadian government just the same as any Canadian income , and you are responsible for filing your own return . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to pay tax on it twice . Canada has tax jurisdiction , and you are only accountable to the Canada Revenue Agency . ( And if you have a GST number you probably know this already , but its relevant to point out here that you shouldnt be charging GST when billing foreign companies . ) <p> So what about the paperwork ? You are n't  required to do it . But that comes with a caveat : convincing the foreign accounting department of that may be difficult , if they do n't  have anyone on staff familiar with the tax treaty . This article may provide you with a bit of negotiating power when dealing with them . Though you do n't  need to , you may find it less burdensome simply to keep a completed W8-BEN on hand and send it in when requested , instead of arguing out the specifics every time . There 's no real harm in doing so , other than the fact that a foreign government agency has a clear trail of your income . ( And considering your clients will be reporting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The W8-BEN does exist for a reason though ; the case we 've been looking at here depends on a few things : <p> You must reside in , and perform all services in Canada . <p> The compensation is received strictly for work for hire , and not for other services , or forms of royalties , capital gains , or other types of income . <p> In the case of other types of income ( royalties became relevant to me last year , for example ) , the W8-BEN is a way to claim additional treaty benefits . In very few instances will you actually have to pay the IRS anything , but there are various other reasons why you may need to fill out the form to make sure a percentage of your income is n't withheld . <p> When a W8-BEN is required , unfortunately you first need to apply for a US taxpayer number , whether that 's an Employer Identification Number ( EIN ) or an Individual Taxpayer Identification Number ( ITIN ) . If you own a business , you have the ability to call the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expect the number to arrive by mail within a month . If you apply for an ITIN , the wait will take a lot longer and you must visit a US consulate ( or visit the country itself ) to have your application notarized by an approved US notary . Considering the narrow window the notary was available at my own local consulate ( M , W , F , 1:30-4:30pm only ) and the long wait for approval , I would highly recommend trying for an EIN first if at all possible . <p> Ill leave you with some parting advice . If you think you might find yourself in a situation where any of this advice is relevant , consult with a tax lawyer now . Bring a laptop or a notepad and write down everything you possibly can during that consultation . The time and effort you save will more than offset the few hundred dollars an hour ; researching this information on your own will not be worth the effort , and misunderstandings can lead to litigation , even if they 're honest mistakes . 
@@99593540 @3793540/ <p> Get a full local backup of your remote web server with some basic command-line interaction and rsync . Bonus for OS X users : clickable icon backup goodness . <p> This is one of those handy tricks I discovered way too late , which some of you may not already know . <p> Problem : You have a web server located somewhere not physically close to you . You use FTP to send and receive files . You 're generally okay with this setup , except for one little chink in the armor : backup . Even if you do n't  run remote scripts which generate files on the server ( I 'm looking at Movable Type here ) which you never remember to backup , sooner or later your local copy and the server will lose synch . <p> Solution : How about a way to backup a perfect copy of the remote server , incrementally , so that each new update only downloads the files that have changed ( and not the whole multi-gigabyte site ) ? Its as great as it sounds . <p> Caveat : Though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ works if the server itself is Unix-based , and you have shell access . If your site runs on IIS , it wont work . If your host does n't  provide you with a shell account , it wont work . In theory , your shell login should be the same as your FTP account , but not necessarily . You may want to get in touch with your host to verify your settings . <p> Warning : The most important things you should pay attention to are the various path settings . If you get them wrong , and somehow end up moving files to or from the wrong spot , data could become corrupted awfully quickly . The first time you run this , make sure you also have an alternate method of recovering from data loss . Just in case . <h> Basic Necessities <p> To pull this off , we need to dip into some Unix hackery , which is a bit scary for those of us used to the cushy buttons and checkboxes of a GUI . If you 're on OS X or Linux , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Terminal in the former , or the command line in the latter . ( If you 're using Linux , presumably you already know how to get a command line and I do n't  have to explain this further , not that I could anyway . ) <p> If you 're on Windows , you 're going to need some extra software , namely something called an " rsync client " . Though its probably overkill , grab Cygwin for now which is a command line environment that comes with a set of powerful tools , all very much like what you get in a Unix-based OS and you 'll get rsync with it . Install , then run Cygwin and you should be taken to a Unix-like command line . <h> Finding Your Local Backup Directory <p> So we should all be on the same page at this point , with a command prompt greeting us ( shown below ) . If you already know how to get to your backup directory on the command line , skip ahead to the header " Running rsync " . <p> Now we want to find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be anywhere on your local system , and getting to it is going to depend largely on your computers configuration . In my case , I have a partition on my hard drive called Shine , which is mounted as a separate volume . This is the equivalent to calling a partition the G : drive in Windows . So let 's begin at the root ( otherwise known as / ) of our system by issuing the " change directory " command : cd / . <p> We can take a look at what 's in the root by issuing the " list " command : ls . <p> Where exactly to go from here depends on your OS ; on a Mac , partitions are stored under /volumes . Under Cygwin on Windows , the User Guide should help you figure out where you need to go . So if were working on a Mac , let 's change the directory to /volumes and take a look at what 's in it using the ls command again : <p> On my system we see two volumes , Sparkle and Shine , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skip the ensuing directory drill-down to find my ultimate destination , but by continuing to use cd and ls to navigate your file system , find the directory you 'll be storing your backup in . ( You can either create it ahead of time with the file manager in your OS , or use the Unix mkdir command once you 're in the parent directory . ) Your prompt will likely be the current path , if not you can display the path by invoking the pwd command : <h> Running rsync <p> Now were ready . Ill cut to the chase and just show you right now what you 're going to be typing ( more or less ) , and explain it afterward : <p> Let 's break it down piece-by-piece . <p> rsync - the program name itself , this is just causing it to run . <p> -aze - these are three options were specifying . a sets archive mode , which does things like preserve permissions and use relative paths . z compresses file data to speed up the transfer . e allows us to connect to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these are the essential ones for what were trying to accomplish . <p> ssh - ssh , or secure shell , is a method of securely connecting to a remote server . The previous e option told rsync that we wanted to do so , and ssh is the protocol were going to use to do it . <p> username@ - this is your username on the remote server . Again , this may be similar to your FTP programs login , or it may not . You 'll want to contact your host if you do n't  know what your shell login is . <p> 67.19.16.228 - this is the IP address of your web server . You likely wont be able to just enter yourdomain.com here , so using your IP address is the best bet . However , that 's a pain when you do n't  have a static IP , so alternatively this can also be the name of your hosts server . I can use **26;1753;TOOLONG in place of an IP address , for example . <p> : **26;1781;TOOLONG - this is the full server path to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Note the preceding colon , this is important for separating the IP address from the server path . By full server path , I mean you need to know where your site sits within the filesystem of the remote server . You might be able to find this with your FTP program by continuing to navigate up in the hierarchy until you can go no further ; then simply chain together the resulting directories you navigated through until you get a full path back down the hierarchy to your web sites root . Otherwise , you may need to contact your host for the full path . <p> . - and finally , an important trailing space followed by a single period . This indicates the current local path , which is where we navigated to earlier . Alternatively you could skip the initial step of finding this on the command line and use an absolute path here instead of a period , ie. **33;1809;TOOLONG . <p> At this point , if you have the correct data entered , you should be ready to go . Hit return , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you for your password . Enter it , then wait . The first sync will take quite a while . <p> If everything is working properly , it will appear that nothing is happening ; when rsync has finished synchronizing , the command prompt will simply pop up again with no message one way or another , and you 'll be able to view the results by issuing an ls command . If you do n't  see your entire remote servers contents now on your local hard drive , something has gone wrong . ( For some reason on OS X , I get a message informing me that " stdin : is not a tty " . It does n't  seem to affect the backup though , and everything else runs as expected . ) <h> Aliasing your Backup <p> That 's about it if you do n't  mind entering the command manually every time you want to backup . But you can also create an alias or a shell script for the entire command that will make life a little easier . In this case , make sure to use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the period , so that the scripts are callable from anywhere . <p> Aliasing involves opening up your shell user profile . There are a bunch of different Unix shells , bash being a more common one . Each will have its own profile naming scheme . In bash , this is . bashprofile , and creating an alias means adding a line like this with your own settings : ( make sure its all on one line ) <p> The user profile file itself is stored in your home directory , which is most likely the directory that loads when you first open up the command line if not , you can get to it with the command cd . It may be difficult to open a file with a preceding period in Windows ( if Cygwin even uses this format ) ; unfortunately I cant really be of much more help here , so the User Manual is once again your friend . <p> Assuming you 've managed to create the alias , you can now invoke the backup simply by typing backup on the command line . <h> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ step further in OS X though , and create a clickable icon for the backup . This involves opening a text editor and creating a new text file , which well save as a shell script . Enter the following as the contents of the file , replacing with your own settings where appropriate : <p> The latter three lines are identical to the command-line we generated earlier , and should all be on one line . Save this file wherever you want it , but make sure to give it a " . command " extension . Also very important , make sure that the line break formats are Unix , not Macintosh or DOS . <p> Once you have this file saved , you 'll need to make sure you have executable permissions on the file . Open up the Terminal again and find the directory you 've saved it in , then issue this command : <p> chmod 744 filename.command <p> The very last step will probably be necessary , depending on your system configuration . In the Finder , right-click ( Ctrl-click if you have to ) on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the " Open with " menu , select Terminal from the list . Close the dialogue , and you 're done . <p> Now whenever you wish to backup your server , all you need to do is double-click the icon and enter your password . If its not working as expected , check out this tutorial on executable scripts for more help . <p> Finally , if this simple set of Unix commands is brand new to you , you may also wish to look into the ability of ssh to lock down your mail , especially if you use a wireless internet connection of any kind . <p> RsyncX is great for local system backups to external drives , I use it all the time . I think I heard once that you 're only going to want to be running it on OS X systems though , due to resource forks , but I 'm not sure about the specifics . I 've never got it working remotely , anyway . <p> Its great to see more people plugging into rsync and how excellent it is . One thing I have n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rsync operation like this , but add in stuff that should be skipped and *not* backed up . <p> Is there any way to do this outside of creating a copy of the item locally and changing its permissions ? <p> If its MySQL , there are plenty of ways . PHPMyAdmin has an option to export databases . Your hosts control panel might too . If nothing else , you can ssh in to your server and use mysqldump . ( I touched on the latter briefly at the end of this article a few months ago LONG ... ) <p> If you are put off by the lack of feedback as rsync is working you can add the " progress " option on the command line ( note that it cant appear between the " e " and the " ssh " ) . Alternatively you could change " -aze ssh " to " -azPe ssh " . <p> If you do n't  want to type your password , you can also generate an SSH key on the command line . <p> " ssh-keygen -t rsa " will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within your home folder . It will ask if you 'd like to add a passphrase to your key . If you do n't  want a passphrase then you can just press return ( but read the warning below ) . <p> The keypair is stored in two files : " idrsa " ( the private part ) and " idrsa.pub " ( the public part ) . Now , you need to copy the public part onto your remote machine . It should be added to the file " authorizedkeys " in the remote " . ssh " directory ( create it if it does n't  exist ) . <p> If you do n't  have an authorizedkeys file , then you can simply copy " idrsa.pub " as that file . The following command will do it . <p> scp /. ssh/idrsa.pub username@remotemachine : . ssh/authorizedkeys <p> ( you 'll need to enter your remote password , hopefully for the last time ) . <p> Now , about SSH key passphrases . If you did n't  add a passphrase to your key , then it means anyone with the private part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the key and potentially gain access to the remote machine . If you can guarantee that file is safe ( using FileVault , never letting anyone touch your machine , etc ) then that 's ok . If you did add a passphrase , then each time you use the key you 'll be asked for the passphrase . This is just as annoying as having to type your password all the time . Fortunately , there are a couple of OSX tools that handle this for you ( SSH Keychain and SSH Agent ) . Its up to you . Either way , your private key is valuable and you should protect it . <p> I like to keep my production sites as clean as possible so when I sync from staging to production I throw a " delete " in there to remove files on production that are not needed anymore : rsync -azE delete /path/on/staging/ /path/on/remote <p> Just a note I believe you have to have a copy of rsync that supports " -E " to use that option . -E helps handle the MacOS metadata so some Linux/Unix @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are not syncing to/from a Mac then you can omit it . I am not a sysadmin so if anyone can confirm that rsync needs to be configured on a Linux/Unix to support MacOS MD that would be great . I use OS X Tiger and my server are updated to handle OS X MD so I always add -E . <p> A quick and easy way to back up a whole mysql DB is : mysqldump -ulogin -ppass opt dbName &gt; dbName.sql <p> Just SSH to your server , run the command and dl/copy your . sql file for safe keeping . <p> I then have a script set up to run nightly to copy such files to my computer , but this means that if the database somehow gets corrupt just before this time , the backup will also be corrupt . So I run multiple scripts in multiple directories , to keep various snapshots of my files taken from different times - nightly , weekly and monthly . ( NOTE : Running automated scripts over SSH requires keypair as described by Dean Jackson , above ) <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on my to-do list for ages . Havent had much luck yet , but I 'll keep plugging away at it . <p> " what about putting your remote directory in Subversion instead ? " <p> I just about added a line to the original article to this effect . svn or cvs would work perfectly well too . I 've just found them harder to grasp ( and higher maintenance ) than rsync . Plus , when working on more than one site the rsync method just seems easier . But that 's just me . <p> Again , I do n't  know if rsync does this , but the added benefit with version control is that you can revert your entire directory and all of its files to a previous state if the need arises . And the need has arisen for me so I 've found it useful . <p> I know what you mean about the setup . I guess it depends on your host . I 'm on TextDrive and setting up a Subversion repository was pretty simple . After setup , I read through the free Subversion book online @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sync , keeping in sync is just : " svn up " . <p> But , as I think you were implying , the important thing is do something that works for you , as long as you do something . <p> My only tip to add to this would be : for finding out the remote path you 're backing up to save having to traipse up the directory tree on your remote server using FTP , just SSH into it instead and run the pwd ( print workin directory ) command . <p> Des , ( and Neil ) , rsync can easily exclude defined files and/or directories using the exclude flag . It is especially handy as you can use wildcards to omit certain files with a specific patterns in their filename . Here are simple examples of two common uses : <p> Putting the remote directory in subversion would be a mess . Youd then have to script something on the remote end to check the whole thing in each day . : - ) <p> For basic site stuff its fine and its good to version @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot of webapps do store some dynamic things in there which also need to be backed up . <p> Wow . First time checking out your site and this is really great stuff even for someone only recently becoming involved with server based web design . Thanks for pointing out some useful knowledge , and keep doing what you do . <p> Great information ! I am considering using this to transfer a complete site from one host to another so preserving permissions is critical as is keeping directory structure ( I 'll be using Mac OSX unless I am forced to use Windows ) . <p> When it comes time to restore to the new host , what is the correct way to expand everything so that all directory structure and files/permissions are restored to the same state they were in the original site ? <p> Just a note on another way to change local directories in the terminal if said directory is open in a window ( or you find traversing through the GUI easier than cd/ls ) .

Too tedious for anyone but me though . <p> So to try ( and fail ) to avoid a self-indulgent narcissism-fest , here 's a simple month-by-month summary of the year you 've been with me , and well leave it at that . <p> November The revised mezzoblue.com launched after some downtime . No one noticed . For the record , you might have visited a month prior . <p> December Not much happened . <p> January Not much happened . <p> February I re-designed to a code-heavy version of the design you 're currently viewing . More or less . 30454 @qwx890454 <p> I was n't going to bother enabling comments for this entry , but let 's try something different . I 'd rather not see a big page of " congratulations on a year " and nothing more . Feel free to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Okay , if this is n't interesting enough , feel free to delete it . I first came across your site after reading your interview at DMXZone . I fell in love with it instantly . Its visually stunning and an inspiration as to what can be achieved ( as is CSS Zen Garden of course ) . I think Second Voice is an excellent innovation , the articles have been good and I 'd love to see more . And this is one of a handful of sites that put forward original ideas that both teach and provoke thought . I think Mezzoblue has made a significant contribution CSS advocacy and web design in general . You should be proud . <p> Its been a great year , as I go back through the posts . I 'm a Canadian citizen as well , and once was on a trip in the states , and won a certain contest . But they removed my prize , saying I was not entitled to it . Jeez . <p> I think I came across your site sometime in June . Looking at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be when you really started to hit it big . Hell when I started reading it I thought you had been established in this game for years . Especially the way people were talking about you . I can only hope that my first year proves as half as successful as yours . Congratulations and may you have many more years ahead of you . <p> Dave , I have to say its been refreshing to read about real designers ( you and some of your regular posters ) , experiences with CSS and other things . There are lots of people out there talking CSS , but most are designers complaining it does n't  fit their exact style or page developers talking purely technically , or people in the middle not saying much useful . I like the fact that you maintain your position as an artist and deal with the underlying technologies in a realistic fashion . <p> I remember visiting your site before you were a star . ( wink ) But I thought you were a woman based solely on your design and some color choices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( winks again ) <p> I remember thinking that this place was non-threatening , and offered friendly advice and I liked how you were learning , too . Some pages , I 'm too scared to even comment cause I look like I have no idea what I 'm doing . But I always considered your website an inspiration . I visit it every day ! : -D <p> Er , um . That 's what you get for skipping the first comment , I suppose . Well , I think a lot of your articles are very interesting and thought-provoking . The CSS Zen Garden is pure genius . And you have a very nice site . I just ca n't seem to design this kind of beautiful things . 
@@99593542 @3793542/ <p> Happy November , its CSS Reboot day . With over 300 participants , there 's a whole lot of fresh pixel goodness to look through . ( Some of the sites seem a bit slow , likely due to the traffic . ) <p> As with any project of this sort , people of all different backgrounds and skill levels have contributed . There are a few token efforts , and some feel strangely inspired by others , but overall the bar has been set rather high for this round . <p> I liked the last version , and I love the new look . Although you can put me down as undecided whether the fixed frame works or not , its good to experiment and a personal site like this is the ideal place for it . <p> " Personal Development " also caught its way into my own notes of Reboots worth to mention , which I will post in the next few days . <p> Its a really good example of how to use semantical markup to achieve accessibility , demonstrating , in the meantime , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> On the same notes , I also scribbled some examples of " heavy inspiration " , but that will most likely not make it to the final post ( just for information , Simplebits seems to be very inspiring overall ; ) ) <p> I like the idea about a cssreboot , but i got to big . I do n't  like the way the pages get voted on ( many good sites have a average of 1.9 , while less good sites is on the top10 ) . And nighter do I like that there is so many pages . I wished for a system where the users gave eachother response , and votes based on the response . That is my opinion . I 'm not happy with my own page , but that is more my problem . <p> I specifically remember clicking on the URL on that page , and I came straight here from clicking it . I thought , this will be interesting , Dave Shea is participating in the Reboot ( how fun ) . Looks like now though , the webmaster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> I think someone was just shankin the status of your name just to get some extra traffic . <p> While that Personal Development site wears its Accessibility banner front-and-centre , it does n't  stand up to much scrutiny . <p> Apart from the fact that the text about accessibility ( apparently " taking into consideration all of the common , as well as most of the uncommon , best practices " ) is far too small and poorly leaded to read comfortably , increasing the font-size to make it easier to see causes the white text to spill onto the white background , rendering it invisible . <p> Unfortunately , each of these sites suffers either from bad contrast , heavy load time , or poor usability ( or includes all these issues ) . Do n't  get me wrong - especially the authors - , all sites definitely look nice ( great work , actually ) , but these issues need to be mentioned and , ideally , to be addressed . <p> I 'm glad I 'm not alone . I agree with Matthew LONG ... entirely . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was that they looked like splash screens ( a homepage with very little information on it which I thought had been denounced as web evil years ago ) which was exacerbated by the fact that there was so much wasted space in prime screen estate . We need to remind designers that it is IT , that is Information Technology . Web sites should be about disseminating information effectively not looking nice or pretty . By all means make the screen pleasing to look at but not at the expense of the message ( unless your message is I 'm pretty vacant , of course ) . <p> Ribic is definitely the best entry so far . None of the other designs seem very interesting to me . One thing I noticed is a lot of them followed the same layout scheme . Banner , navigation , content , footer . And a lot of them seem to have two or three boxes beneath the navigation , as seen in Personal Development . <p> anyway , I think the entries were better in the original CSS Reboot back in May . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around .

@@99593543 @3793543/ <p> So . Relevant browsers that will continue : Safari , Mozilla , Opera , and somewhere way down the road , IE/Win . Relevant browsers that will not : IE/Mac and Netscape . Given the tiny market shares for each , in the grand scheme of things , all were losing is a false sense of security . Change is inevitable ; learn to love it . <p> Other than Internet Explorer , Microsoft has created other utilities that mimic popular software to undercut competition . Windows Media Player has had roughly the same development cycle as the browser , and the only reason I can see that Real , Quicktime , and even Winamp are still around is because of proprietary media formats that the vendors refuse to open . <p> Ironic , is n't it ? I 'm not saying standards killed the competition , but I wonder to what extent Microsofts involvement in the W3C will continue from this point . <p> The latest incarnation feels like a wellthought out marketing site , highlighting product features and quoting Time Magazine , Joel Spolsky , and others . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and if theyd like some volunteer work to polish it even further , all they need do is ask . <p> The question begs itself : if web services really are where software is going , why are n't  more software developers making noise against the death of the browser ? Avoiding Sharecropping logically means supporting open software/standards . Developing for one browser is no different than developing for one operating system . 30454 @qwx890454 <p> While the new mozilla.org is an improvement its just not going to cut it . With Netscape gone , Mozilla must now take the role of end-user browser ( Firebird can take Mozillas role as developer browserremember : Mozilla will soon be a rebranded version of Firebirdsound familiar ? ) and the site really needs to simplify the download process . They have to slap a very prominant DOWNLOAD button at the top somewhere and do what Opera.com does : detect OS-type and redirect so that users are presented with a single download option for their particular operating system . Someone ( on some blog out there ) suggested setting up a mozilla.com for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fine too . <p> This reminds me a lot of the W3Cs recent redesign and ensuing redesign competition that resulted in some spectacular designs . <p> Perhaps a redesign competition is in order for Mozilla.org . Dave , I cant think of anyone more qualified than you to run such a competition given all the great work you 've done with CSS Zen Garden . : ) <p> Yes , the new mozilla.org is definitely a step in the right direction , but unfortunately traces of geekiness still remain . " Stable Releases " ? Come on , Mozilla ! Why not use the simple and recognizable " Downloads " ? <p> Well the crappy thing about the new Mozilla redesign is that just the day before I had written an entry on why Mozilla needs to redesign their site . I did n't  publish it because there were some more thoughts I wanted to add . Lo and behold they change their site on me . Much better because it helps non-super web users get down to business and download the browser and learn about it . <p> I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well and does n't  try to do a million things like Media Player . Real is still around because they have other sources of income and QuickTime because Apple makes it . Also there is no money or threat to Microsoft from the use of these applications like there was Netscape so therefore they do n't  need to put that much effort into destroying them . No one makes money off of browsers and no one will make money off an mp3 player . 
@@99593544 @3793544/ <p> here 's one for Google . If you use Camino to browse , and more relevantly if you store important bookmarks in Camino , you might want to know about a nasty little bug that could pop up sooner or later . <p> Camino appears to have a problem with its bookmarks file format . It saves out your entire list of bookmarks as an XML file , bookmarks.plist , and there 's a bug that causes this file to become corrupt , which looks like this : <p> After you hit the OK button , all your bookmarks whether in the main menu or the bookmark bar disappear from the browser . <p> Alls not lost though . Camino attempts to save the file as **25;1844;TOOLONG , which is located in /Library/Application Support/Camino/ ( where is your user directory ) . This file should contain what you lost , just in a format that Camino ca n't read anymore . <p> It appears that Camino saves out this file every time you close the browser . Whatever the cause of the bug is , the result is that it saves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intact , but the XML is n't valid , so Camino chokes on it and throws up an error . <p> There are two options at this point . One , you can debug the XML . Two , you can use the URLs within this file to manually reconstruct your bookmark list ( though presumably you 'll be smart enough to do this in another browser or on delicious , if you go this route ) . <p> I ended up debugging the XML . Through trial and error ( deleting large swaths of bookmarks at a time , loading Camino to see if I got the error or not , and a lot of restoring the corrupted file ) I was able to pinpoint two or three locations where the XML was invalid . In one case , the angle brackets were reversed . Instead of seeing this : <p> **27;1871;TOOLONG <p> I noticed the first right-facing bracket was reversed : <p> **27;1900;TOOLONG <p> In the second case I was n't patient enough to track down the specific error , so I just deleted the 10 or so bookmarks that were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ main take-away from this experience is that Camino users ought to back up their bookmarks on a regular basis , or store them in another browser until this bug is fixed . <p> There is a handy little script http : **36;1929;TOOLONG that allows you to post to a Del.icio.us account from Camino . You still have to manually refresh the list , but at least this way they 're stored outside the browser . <p> I hope in Firefox they wont screw up the bookmark format for the sake of change .

I have the same Netscape bookmark file since Oct. 1996 , now it has 2400 bookmarks and works with the latest Firefox and the Google Browser sync . <p> Kula , that is the case now , but the next major Firefox release is again planning to move from their current model for bookmarks to what they 're naming " Places " which stores bookmarks , history , etc in a local sqlite DB and abandons the HTML format

@@99593546 @3793546/ <p> After a week of feeling blah , this is one Friday where I just felt like being pandered to . For the first time in well over a year , almost two , I rented a movie . <p> I guess its because of my lack of a TV that I stopped . After my last move , I decided not to buy one , and I 'd call that one of my best decisions to date . I have a DVD drive in my computer and a reasonably nice monitor , so I decided that I 'd be okay with that and went to get something . <p> Rogers Video was where I ended up , the same one I use to go to frequently . I wanted to hit up the smaller independent place just down the street rather than the evil national chain , but I already had the membership so that 's where I went instead . I browsed the store , looking at the recent popcorn fare , trying to figure out what I actually could bear watching . My choice was between The Bourne Identity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I own Ludlums book and I 'd rather read it first , then catch the movie . ( Although sometimes its better to do it the other way ) <p> I grabbed the DVD , walked to the counter , and handed the clerk my card . He swiped it , looked up , and asked if I usually rent from another store ? <p> Let me take a break for a second and rant , if you 'll indulge me : the Rogers Group is Canadas largest media conglomerate , dealing with things like video and game rentals , cable and internet , and wireless communication . They 're in the communication business . So why the hell do they have such a hard time hooking their stores up to each other ? ? Try renting a movie at a Rogers Video with a Rogers Video rental card , and if its a store other than the one you got the card at , you have to go through the whole signup/verification process again ! <p> Anyway , I 've had this exact same problem with this exact same store . I said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what 's the problem ? He replied that I was n't in the system , and had I rented recently , say in the past six months ? I told him I had not . He said that was the problem the system deletes anyone who has n't  rented within six months , and I 'd have to sign up again . <p> I started handing him my drivers license , then I paused to consider . Actually , nevermind , I said . This is when he gave me an incredulous look , and asked somewhat sourly , what , you 're not going to rent then ? I replied I was , thank you , but not from you . Instead , I 'm going to walk right across the street ( pointing with my finger ) and rent from the other store , because I do n't  like your practice . He said all it takes is just for me to give my credit card and drivers license info again . I said I 'd done it before , and since I do n't  rent often , I do n't  want to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ future . Sorry . And I walked out the door . <p> I walked into the smaller store , happily signed up using the exact same process I 'd have had to go through at Rogers , grabbed Minority Report , and walked home . But not before detouring , tapping the window , slamming the DVD up against the glass and asking the guy at Rogers how he liked them apples . <p> Well , no , I lie I only thought of that later . But the point is that stupid business practices drive customers away . Sure I have n't rented recently , but that does n't  mean I wo n't start again at some point in the near future .

@@99593548 @3793548/ <p> A standard is a standard is a standard . But what if those standards do n't  work as directed ? <p> Over time , Ive come to the conclusion that Accesskeys are more harmful than good . Until browsers allow a user to override a documents Accesskeys , I wont use them . <p> The idea is a simple one : by using the accesskey= " n " attribute on specific links in your HTML , you define n as a hot key that allows keyboard access to that particular link . Mark Pilgrim has more on the syntax and usage of Accesskeys . <p> WATS.ca has written a series of in-depth articles ( Is it Worth it ? , More Reasons , Accesskey Alternatives ) that go into the problems with this seemingly simple idea . Executive summary : key conflicts with existing browsers/operating systems/user macros prevent Accesskeys from doing the job as described . <p> The problem has been stewing in the back of my mind for a while . But it really hit home last week : I received an e-mail from someone complaining about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Go to the Zen Garden in any browser that allows the ALT+D key combination to select the address bar ( IE and most Gecko browsers will do the trick , Safari will not ) . Try selecting the address bar from the keyboard . Instead of doing so , some browsers will select the fourth design from the list on the right , since that list has been assigned sequential keys from a to h . <p> The annoyance factor is high , and in some cases it may be downright harmful . Accesskeys are a good idea ; too bad they 're not practical . 30454 @qwx890454 <p> That 's why most browsers are moving towards control-keys for browser control , freeing the alt keys for access requirements . For example , ctrl-L is now the preferred way to get to the location bar in Mozilla ( or open a dialog for a new location in IE ) . <p> The problem is were trying to support people who dont/cant use a pointing device while also trying to support a legacy of nonstandardisation . Someone is going to have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is more harmful ? <p> Yes , I 've been thinking about this , too . And the same problem is present regarding tabindex also , which is ( among other standards ) poorly supported in IE. Pressing tab key in the freshly opened page will select adressbar(s) of the browser primarily , and then proceed with the actual document . More frustrating is that refreshing a page ( F5 ) would n't help if visitor lost tabindex sequence . In case of , one should open a new browser window or just keep pressing .. <p> For me , this is just another standard which has neither actually been tested in real conditions , nor made completely .. <p> Maybe we should keep making different versions of each page after all ? Or make a list of unused letters in browsers/OS and stick to it ? We still have numbers , do n't  we ? But they are not intuitive .. <p> Some great comments flying around here - a few things to respond to , so Ill try to do that here in one reply : <p> 1 . Jor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We had suggested similar in that last article on Accesskey Alternatives ( see LONG ... ) , and believe it would be better to include it in a LINK element than an A element for the most part , unless the links are actually " visible " links by definition . That will require more testing as well , for a variety of reasons , including browser support . <p> 2 . Dave re : how to deal with a mass of links like on Annes site . I 'm not really sure we need to deal with it that much for browsers like Lynx . We had also proposed using the LINK element as an alternative to using skip navigation links etc , so if you define a LINK to Page content near the top of the list of your LINKs in the HEAD , you 'd be presented with that link almost first , which would deal with that problem . Of course other user agents may be different , but at some point the implementation would be up to them - we 've done our job by creating the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Content " is listed as a LINK near the top of our list of LINKs . <p> 3 . Michael re : the hierarchy idea . Yes , that would deal with one of the issues with accesskeys ( i.e. , conflict resolution ) . However , it still does n't  deal with the issue of standardization and the usefulness of accesskeys . I still do n't  believe that author defined accesskeys are the way to go . I 'm all for us defining appropriate LINK rel types , and convincing browser makers to allow custom keybindings based on the users so that the users can define their own keyboard shortcuts to use on *every* site . <p> 4 . Operas lack of support for Numeric Accesskeys just seems to be the nail in the coffin . Numeric accesskeys had very little conflict save for some conflicts with Window Eyes ( see LONG ... ) . Many site authors looked to numeric accesskeys as their last hope , and in fact , many governments have advocated/mandated the use of numeric accesskeys . We recommended to the Government of Canada in 2002 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ using accesskeys on their pages for some of these very reasons . As we 've continued with the research , we 've found them to be more problems than they are worth we 'd rather see some other method for providing the same functionality , but without the problems seen with the current implementation of accesskeys . <p> Derek : I understand what you are saying about interpage navigation and that 's fine . My assumption has always been that accesskeys were geared more toward in-page navigation . I.E. moving THROUGH or TO a group of fields or navigating to a specific section of content within the page ( &lt;label for= " myInput " accesskey= " m " &gt;My Input&lt;/label&gt; ) . <p> Will the LINK REL be able to address this part of the navigation or do we still need accesskeys for that portion ? <p> I think the context in which its being discussed here it seems more like " ALT-H " goes to " Home " page , " ALT-L " goes to " Links " , " ALT-A " goes to " About " . I personally think that 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes ! Being an avid using of the Alt-D combo to jump to the address bar for years , this is an extremely i 'll side effect of the access keys . Although the idea of browsers moving their access keys to the Ctrl-D combo instead is moderately satisfactory , who decided to that Access Keys shall use the Alt-XX combo ? <p> Is it not obvious that Alt-XX is the magic bliss of anti-mouse advocates and has been forever ? Even in the crumpy DOS editor you can use Alt to get to the menu bar , surely choosing Ctrl-XX for the Access Key standard would have been a more suitable choice . <p> So , access keys have implementation issues . That does n't  mean that they , or something like them , are not a good idea . Clearly , there are two problems that need to be solved - how to enable rapid keyboard based navigation within a single document and how to enable rapid keyboard based navigation between documents . Clearly , for both cases , it would make sense to provide a convenient interface to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one simply provide standard shortcuts for the items already visible in the Mozilla site navigation bar ( Top , Up , Down , Previous , Next , Last ) . This would not cause any obvious problems . Links with a rel not in that defined list would be more problematic , but one can certianly imagine interfaces that would allow these to be accessed via the keyboard - a link sidebar for example . <p> The same is true of intrapage keyboard navigation to elements with a defined accesskey . These elements could be made avaliable via the ( otherwise mostly useless ) go menu or via a sidebar - this would provide some keyboard access to important navigational elements , since the go menu can always be accessed via ctrl-g ( or whatever ) . One could display the author defined access keys in the menu so that the user had a simple way of determining which keys were in use as access keys . Alternativley , a browser author may decide to ignore the accesskey part of the spec and instead implement a system where elements defined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keybindings in some predetermined fashion - e.g. to the combinations alt+digit for each digit 0-9 according to order on the page . It would n't be perfect , but it would at least prevent conflicts . <p> In short , I think that many of the current issues with accesskeys are implementation difficulties rather than anything more fundamental - although I would be interested to know of any alternative proposals that encompassed the same functionality but without the difficulties ( the most obvious I can think of would be to provide a simple attribute that indicated that a keyboard shortcut should be assigned to a particular element , relying on the UA to implement the actual shortcut , with predefined shortcuts for particular valoues of rel ) . Moreover , if the majority od UAs support numeric accesskeys and they cause few problems , I do n't  see the lack of support from opera being a reason not to use them . It ; s difficult to see any substantial disadvantage and if they come into wider use , Opera might be encouraged to add support . <p> In my opinion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MSIE and Geckos allow basic keyboard navigation , Opera uses nearly the complete keyboard for navigation , so accesskeys are delegated to a special accesskey mode . Thus alt+D does not select the accesskey d , but shift+esc-and-then-d does . <p> Accesskeys are badly documented , there is nothing in the spec detailing how they should be made visible , and since unlike the LINK types there are no standard accesskeys defined at all , there is little or no consistency across website , requiring a user to relearn accesskeys on a per-site basis . I 've even encountered situations where page A of corporate website N had accesskeys defined , but page B of the same website had entirely different accesskeys . <p> I 'm all in favour of dropping them completely : a far better accesskey scheme could be devised using the LINK types . Remember &lt;a rel= " accessibility " title= " accessibility statement " href= " foobar " &gt; is perfectly valid HTML ! A user could then simply map a button or keypress to the accessibility link type , and know that no matter what website he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> I am re-thinking accesskeys too . If they ultimately lead to something less accessible then , as you say , they do more harm than good . <p> Someone also emailed me recently about my site asking why , when they pressed a certain key combination , the browser did not do what they expected . Obviously , one of the accesskeys attached to a navigation element was overriding a keyboard shortcut for the browser . <p> This is a shame , because the idea is a good one ( although there is that other problem of how you let the user know what the accesskeys actually are ! ) . Maybe there are certain keys that have an improbable conflict , such as the numbers maybe ? <p> Plus this would majorly conflict with the Moz/Firebird feature of automatically searching the page for what you type . I would get pretty ticked if I started typing a word then ended up on a whole new page or whatever ! <p> As Jor pointed out , and somethng that we first commented on in November , there are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ development . <p> We do like the idea of allowing the end user to map keystrokes to activate links that have specific relationships defined via the rel attribute put the user in control . <p> Philosophically , I believe we should not be defining accesskeys in our documents , but rather we should be defining proper LINKs to those areas we see as important ( we need to expand on the list of rel attributes that are defined by default within HTML ) , then allowing the users to define their own keystrokes to invoke them . That way , I can use whatever keystrokes I want to get to the HOME page , the CONTACT form , the SEARCH form if it exists , the ACCESSIBILITY statement , and we do n't  have to standardize accesskeys across different sites , because we leave it to the browsers/users . I use what I want , you use what you want , and we have less conflict to worry about <p> The number of sites that use accesskeys is still relatively small , yet they are mired with conflicting choices for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standard " accesskeys are free to add in whatever they like , making it difficult to claim any sort of standardization at all . <p> That is why we think we need to look at different methods as we outlined in the last article Dave pointed to Link Relationships as an Alternative to Accesskeys LONG ... <p> I believe LINK is the way to go , but I 'm concerned about various implementations . Since , for example , Lynx dumps all LINKed items at the beginning of the document , theoretically if you have a site that lists a ton like Annes - http : //annevankesteren.nl/ - you 'll need a special " Skip Nav " link for your LINKs , no ? How would one go about implementing *that* ? <p> I think , as with any standard , the browser makers need to see significant pressure in the form of use ( or abuse ) of the standard before they will step in and make changes to the browser . <p> If we abandon use the manufacturers assume its not needed , not that the browser is broken . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standard whereever possible and then yell at the individual browser makers to resolve the very real accessibility issues caused not by the standard but by their applications . <p> Accesskeys and tabindex are accessibility tools . The application developers just need to find a way to support them properly . <p> My choice for accesskeys would be to set up a hierarchy . For example : The first time you hit " Alt-H " the applications looks at where the focus is , is it on the page ? Is there an accesskey " Alt-H " for the page ? Yes ? Use it ! No ? Then travel up to the application level and see if there 's an accesskey " Alt-H " there . Yes ? Use it ! No ? Then travel up to the OS level and pass the Alt-H to it so that it can go on to either the OS or some hotkey helper application . An additional keypress on H would tell the application to move immediately up the chain if I know " that 's not the alt-h I want " . <p> In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alt-e as an accesskey to an e-mail field then Alt-e would put a focus on the field whereas Alt-e-e would would go to Edit on the file menu . Then you could have accesskeys without worrying about real conflict . Accesskeys then become somewhat like Alt-TAB taskmanagement just Alt- then TAB until you get the selection you want . <p> Dave , did you get an email that looked anything like this ? Its possible you were a victom of a automated email campaign to get webmasters to start using accesskeys. not sure why someone would send out automated emails like this , but this email has been sent to several people I know : <p> - Dear Webmaster , <p> Just a quick suggestion , since I can not find it in your accessability statement How about adding keyboard shortcuts to some of the links on your site ? <p> As well as being quite important to disabled people and the elderly , they also make everything faster and more convenient for everybody else , too . <p> They work on almost all version 5 browsers , and clearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ones . <p> The code is simple enough : Search <p> The above produces a link that can be activated by the user pressing Alt+4 on their keyboard . In theory , any character can be used , but in practice , most letters can not be used , since they may interfere with the browsers own hotkeys for the menus . However , some common numeric standards are emerging , for example : 1 Home Page 2 Skip Nav ( or What 's new ) 3 Site Map ( or Printer Version ) 4 Search 5 FAQ 8 Terms Of Service 9 Feedback 0 Accesskey List <p> The above scheme is now in use on every UK government and council site , as well as on healthcare sites , and now also on USA academic sites , Australian Government sites , and mainland Europe commercial sites . <p> Something to think about Companies around the world are spending trillions on wheelchair access for buildings and carparks , and there are many US , UK and international laws coming into force to require this ( 508 , and the Disability Discrimination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I believe I did get a copy of that a month or so back . Interesting that someone is concerned enough about accessibility that theyd resort to spam . <p> jgraham - Its most definitely an implementation issue . While your proposal is rather interesting , I 'm faced with the reality of what is supported right now . In their current form they just do n't  hold up well . <p> Aside from conflicts , discoverability is a problem . If a numeric standard were to be followed , that would cut down on confusion . But it would also limit the functionality ; the proposed numeric standard does n't  take into account , for example , web apps . <p> One thing WATS did n't  cover that I can only put forward as hearsay is that JAWS allows custom mapping , and many advanced users will have a lot of customized key combinations already setup . Conflict with those , and you 're hurting the very people Accesskeys were built for . Again hearsay , not first-hand experience . <p> Isnt it a solution to use accesskeys and tabindex together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Give the first item of each one a numeric ( I do n't  think those are being used by the browser themselves ) accesskey and from there let it over to the tabindex . As far as I know when you use an accesskey it jumpes then to the first item . Hitting tab will jump the focus to the second . <p> &gt; While your proposal is rather interesting , I 'm faced with the reality of what is supported right now . In their current form they just do n't  hold up well . <p> Yeah , I know . But I 'm interested to know whether this is an implementation issue or its a fundamental problem with the accesskey spec . If its just a case that implementations of the spec are poor , then the best that anyone can do is make an extension ( or even a full blown patch ) for their choice of browser ( assuming they use a browser where user extensions are possible ) and hope that people pick up on it so that support in general improves . If , on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ satisfactory way , then this discussion should be happening on www-html , not here . ( Incidentally , the most informative reference that I found ( after a very brief search ) about accesskeys on the w3c public mailing lists is LONG ... ) . This supports the view that problems with accesskey are iimplementation problems rather than spec problems . <p> Incidentally , another approach to avoiding the keybinding clash problems is to avoid using standard command keys to access accesskeys . One could use a mechanism consistent with the typeaheadfind in mozilla and use say # to put you in a go to accesskey mode . The fact that the spec suggests using alt or cmd as a modifier to get to the accesskey is imho a bug in the spec that is responsible for many of the current issues . <p> Dave the custom keystroke mapping in JAWS , WindowEyes , and Opera is what eventually lead us towards suggesting things being user configurable . In using JAWS and WindowEyes for minor testing I saw the *very* high degree of end-user configurability in terms of keystroke access @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alt + 9 for user defined " windows " that represent different areas of the screen . The keys can be reconfigured to allow the user to remap the keystrokes to something else if they choose . Same appears to be true for Opera in terms of defining keystrokes there via Edit &gt; Preferences , and then modifying the keyboard setup . It is very easy for instance to change the Open dialog box from ctrl + o to simply the single keystroke o if I want to . <p> Many of the issues that we have pointed out are implementation issues . However , we believe that there *are* other issues to be dealt with at a higher level . <p> We believe that we are moving towards an end goal of putting the user in control . To us , this means providing a mechanism for rapid keyboard navigation in the users User Agent of choice , based on what the user defines in their preferences rather than what the authors of individual sites decide is an " intuitive " key to use for a particular shortcut . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end goal . <p> That is what eventually convinced us that there needed to be another way of providing the same type of functionality . Seeing that end user configurability and the W3C User Agent Guidelines are leaning towards allowing for binding of custom keystrokes to different actions meant that author-defined keystrokes could eventually become meaningless anyway . <p> So , if we need to make significant changes to the way things currently are anyway , we believe that we should be asking the questions that we have been asking for a while ( use of " we " in these questions is a global collective we ) : " What *should* we be doing ? " , " Can we look for/develop a different solution(s) that will not have the same implementation problems ? " , " Can we come up with something that is more standardized for the benefit of all ? " , " Can we come up with something better ? " <p> As for where the discussion should be taking place we see it all the time on discussion forums , on the WAI list @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pops up , we participate . <p> In every forum in which we participate , and in our own resources/articles that we post , we are also very careful to state clearly that : <p> 1 . We like the idea behind accesskeys , 2 . We find the implementation very problematic 3 . We believe that we collectively need to examine the issue and determine if we need to develop other solutions that better suit the needs of everyone . <p> Yeah , I know . But I 'm interested to know whether this is an implementation issue or its a fundamental problem with the accesskey spec . If its just a case that implementations of the spec are poor , then the best that anyone can do is make an extension ( or even a full blown patch ) for their choice of browser ( assuming they use a browser where user extensions are possible ) and hope that people pick up on it so that support in general improves . <p> *Of course* this is an implementation issue . One browser that does it right is Mac Mozilla @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No conflict ; no problem . <p> If other browser writers are too lame to implement accesskeys properly , that 's no reason to punish users of browsers who can use them . <p> And the target audience of Accesskeys is more than just " JAWS users " . Its anyone who does n't  use a mouse for navigation . That could be someone with Carpal Tunnel , using voice-actuation for navigation . It could be someone browsing in a text-based browser , <p> And , as to the proposed alternative of providing client-side configurable key-bindings to the &lt;link rel= " " &gt; elements , that 's a fine idea , but its *foolish* to assume that such keybindings would be useful across sites . Web authors are no more likely to " standardize " on a common set of link targets ( beyond the predefined ones ) than they have on a common set of accesskeys . <p> Lynx provides keyboard access to the &lt;link rel= " " &gt; elements on a page . Mozilla and Opera expose them to the user , but do n't  provide keyboard access . it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even if they did , web authors would still gripe and complain and not use them , because " Browser X " does n't  support it . <p> &gt; *Of course* this is an implementation issue . One browser that does it right is Mac Mozilla . Keyboard shortcuts are Command-key ; accesskeys are Control-key . No conflict ; no problem . <p> Well m not sure its so obvious . The reason it works on the Mac is that there are a larger number of modifier keys than on most other platforms and the command key is largely unused ( the links mpt posted suggest that it can be bound to user macros ) . At the very least , I think the part of the spec that suggests using modifier keys to access these functions should be removed - modifier keys are already used in complex platform and application dependent ways that a document author can not hope to antcipate over the full range of platforms . Even though this part of the spec is clearly informative , it appears to be bad advice . <p> &gt; Web @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a common set of link targets ( beyond the predefined ones ) than they have on a common set of accesskeys . <p> Well having the standard link targets avaliable for keyboard navigation would be a huge improvement in itself . This really is an implementation issue . On the other hand , if there are widely used link targets that are not standardised , maybe they need to be standardised too ( that does n't  even require a html rewrite - one could simply produce a specifcation like a more useful version of xfn ( http : //gmpg.org/xfn/index ) ) . One can imagine rel= " document-body " for a skip navigation type link and rel= " navigation " for a link to a set of hyperlinks , for example . Getting people to support such a specifcation is , of course , harder , but that 's a different problem . <p> &gt; But , even if they did , web authors would still gripe and complain and not use them , because " Browser X " does n't  support it . <p> " The reason it works on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ modifier keys than on most other platforms and the command key is largely unused . " <p> The Mac does not have an unusually large number of modifier keys . It has 3 : Command , Option and Control ( 4 , if you count Shift ) . <p> It just uses them more intelligently . <p> Application keyboard shortcuts are always Command-key . And you can combine modifier keys , so applications with a large number of keyboard shortcuts might avail themselves of Option-Command-key or Shift-Command-key as well . <p> So , using Control-key for accesskeys is wide open . <p> You are completely correct that the Spec should not have suggested implementation details . That should have been left to browser writers . HTML specification-writers clearly are n't  user-interface experts and , even if they were , they should not presume to dictate the user-interface in all browsers on all platforms . <p> I agree strongly with Derek Featherstones view that rather than relying on authors proprietary sets of keyboard navigation we should " provide a mechanism for rapid keyboard navigation in the users User Agent of choice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ per browser anywayit makes perfect sense that standard navigation be the responsibility of the browser . <p> Though not really keyboard-based , Opera has an interesting answer to standard data in that it displays the links as buttons above the web page . Examples can be seen on the following pages when viewed in Opera : <p> I believe it is safe to say that unlike us , non-computer enthusiasts generally dislike keyboard shortcuts and find them much trickier than pointing and clicking . If browsers were to implement something like Operas visual solution AND assign them some kind of keystroke wed have an excellent solution to our problem . <p> To me the problem is still one of implementation vs. specification . Access key behavior from the W3 documentation is pretty clearly defined . <p> The problem comes in the fact that : 1 ) Each OS has its own methods of dealing with keyboard shortcuts . 2 ) Each user agent has its own methods of dealing with keyboard shortcuts . 3 ) Each user has his/her own method of dealing with keyboard shortcuts . 4 ) Helper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> And there 's no management process available to allow all these differing methods to meld . <p> In general on Windows it works like this ( I say in general because there are stupid exceptions ALWAYS ) : <p> So at least for Windows there are two fundamental problems with conflict resolution for duplicate shortcuts and third party applications that override the guidelines ( like shortcut/macro programs or helper applications ) . <p> I think that there is something that you can do about the first problem . Which I stated in my previous post . We need for the application or the OS to have a keyboard shortcut conflict resolution mechanism . The second problem you can do little to nothing for . <p> It will never be perfect <p> Part of why all of these helper applications have sprung up and created their own keyboard shortcuts is because of a lack of consideration by the developer community as a whole to attempt to conform to a years old standard . The problem ends up being the AOL/ADA problem : <p> Years ago AOLs software was not screen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more blind users subscribed to the service wed have more incentive to make the software accessible " . Of course how many blind users are going to sign up for a service that they ca n't use . So which should come first - USE or USEFULLNESS . <p> Right now there 's no incentive for the browser makers to do anything different . JAWS et al already do a lot for keyboard navigation . So should we throw our hands up and just say to hell with it ? If that were the case wed all be using MSHTML right now . <p> I say use the standard where you can . If it reaches 86% of the userbase and they see it as good , then great . If the other 14% cant use that EXTRA feature ( that 's based on an existing standard ) then maybe theyll complain to the browser manufacturer for a better implementation . We have to put pressure on the manufacturers to do better . Its a must . <p> " One browser that does it right is Mac Mozilla . Keyboard shortcuts are Command-key @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> Just expanding on this thought - the problem in casting a spotlight on a Mac browser is that the Mac OS is more or less impossible to use without a mouse in the first place . Maybe this is my relative inexperience with the system talking though , its true I 've only been a user for a few months . <p> Changing gears - I 've been a mouse user for over ten years , its an extension of my arm at this point . And yet I *need* keyboard access to my operating system and my browser . Its the way I work . <p> So to someone like me , Accesskeys are a great idea . I 'd love to see the proposed numeric standard take hold , nothing could be better than relying on one set of keys to do exactly the same thing across all sites you visit . It would be great if I had control over what those particular keys are , of course . <p> Looking at the spec , if I 'm reading this right , the conflict I originally started this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and expected according to UAAG - LONG ... - just highly inconvenient , and problematic ( especially considering the other half about alerting the user does n't  happen ) Spec problem or implementation problem ? Probably a little of both . <p> Derek , you 've done well highlighting the current issues with the technology , and how things might change . Its where I have to leave the discussion , since my own agenda lies in what 's practical today . But with people such as yourself working to better the technology , I 'm sure we can look forward to a useful alternative . <p> For me , in Mozilla , F6 brings focus to the search field in my sidebar searchnot the same as alt+d , which brings focus to the address bar . <p> Even if F6 did work the same , all the time , as alt+dits much harder to use as a shortcut since it requires moving your hand from the home position ( unless you have REALLY long fingers . ) <p> Ive been thinking about this issue recently as well . I tried making my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the user , and used CSS to label them as such ( underlining the accesskey letter in the actual link . ) Still , it bothered me that one or more of these keys may be used for something else on the users computer . I thought about switching to numbers , but the comment that WindowEyes reserves atl+number for its own use has swayed me . For now , access keys are gone . <p> That part of that document seems rather far removed from reality . As far as I know ( although I may be wrong ) applications have very little in the way of ability to detect keyboard conflicts . In Mozilla , for example , I believe that keyboard events " bubble " up through all the possible layers that can handle that event . Any event can call preventbubble which will stop any higher level events from finding out about the keyboard event - so they have no way of knowing that there is an event that they have missed . Now I suppose that one could , in principle provide some additional communication @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a similar mechanism that passes unhandled events to the operating system . As far as I know ( and I could be wrong ) , there is no way for any application to tell if the OS will do anything with an event that it passes - so detecting conflicts is in fact impossible ( modulo operating system rewrites ) . <p> Assuming that one could detect a conflict , its not clear how much alerting the user would help . Given that the majority of users ignore alerts ( presumably this would have to be a status bar type alert , since an alert that interrupted workflow would make keyboard navigation useless for people who did want to use it ) , theyd still wonder why alt+D was n't focusing the location bar but was instead scrolling the page . <p> The most useful suggestion there is to place the author bindings in a menu , so that one could guarentee a shortcut of the form ctrl+menu access key+element accesskey , although one couldnt have two items with the same accesskey in this scheme . <p> &gt; The Mac @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It has 3 : Command , Option and Control ( 4 , if you count Shift ) . <p> That 's one more than the number of unique modifier keys that are expected to be on a PC keyboard ( ctrl , alt , shift ) . Admittedly , Alt and Alt Gr are actually different , but I 'm not sure if all operating systems ( or all keyboards ) make this distinction . Additionally , many recent keyboards have the Super ( or Windows ) key - but this is *another* key that is used for OS level events . <p> &gt; nothing could be better than relying on one set of keys to do exactly the same thing across all sites you visit . <p> The obvious problem being that all sites are different , and so might have different concepts of what doing the " same " thing entails . Moreover , different sites have different elements that would be considred important . <p> &gt; Its where I have to leave the discussion , since my own agenda lies in what 's practical today . <p> Well no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ define a set of accesskeys and provide a script to disable them . Or produce two versions of the page , one with accesskeys and one without . Provide a list of accesskeys and the option to switch to the alternative version of the site ( controlled by a cookie on subsequent visits ) if the user experiences conflicts . A lot of work for a little gain ? Probably , but these things are still possible . <p> coming in late on this , and its probably already been said , butthe point of accesskeys is to provide a minimal set of shortcuts . having more than a handful of them is actually more harmful and confusing than not having them . unless the site is visited on a regular basis , users will not bother to learn all the keys . having only the accesskeys for skipping to content , the search field , etc is the best solution , and in most cases ( sticking to the numeric accesskeys ) should not conflict with any other key assignments <p> I used to use Access Keys all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . However since I discovered Type Ahead Find in Mozilla I 've been using that instead . It works on any page on any website with no effort from the designer ( as long as they are smart enough to use " click here " for everything ; and do n't  use images-for-links all over the place ) . Also there is no need to memorise anything just type what you are looking for . <p> I sincerely hope all browsers implement a type-ahead find feature . It is the best browser innovation Ive seen in a long time . <p> The first thing to notice is that wats.ca do n't  really know what they 're talking about . They state that M ca n't be used as an accesskey because Alt+M is reserved in Opera . But then Opera does n't  even use Alt to invoke accesskeys ! ! <p> Marko- you wan na create a list of unused letters in every browser/OS ? Its gon na take you a while to cover every language . And then what do you do when you 've only got left ? <p> Numbers are obviously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Opera 7.22 on Win2K , so I 'm not sure about the people who say they are n't  accepted ) . Aside from avoiding conflict , they are also usable on the new generation of internet devices . Think mobile cellphones , and the remote pads of MSN-TV set-top box ( they only have 10 keys anyway ! ) . A worldwide standard has already been set up , and without any other standard to compete with , it has been widely adopted . They are also pretty intuative : <p> Chintana- its not that the browsers offer buggy support . They do n't  . They support them fully and perfectly . Accesskeys are supported on all browsers on all OS ( with the one slight exception of Safari ) . IE4 had them in 1997 . Netscape has them from 2000 , so does Opera , iCab , Mozilla et al , Phoenix/Firebird , Amaya <p> LINK REL types are OK for links , but what about form elements ? No luck there . <p> Michael- I like your hierarchy idea for screenreaders . <p> And the other idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good as well . Alt is only a suggestion , but some other combination might also work . ( how about Alt+Shft ? or even Control+AltGr ? ) <p> If you 're going with letters , then a Satus bar type alert sounds like another good idea . Maybe even ask the user in the settings if they want to dismiss all page-accesskeys that conflict with the browser ones <p> I guess accesskeys are supported by at least all major browsers . But every browser defines its own HotKeys and functionality . Therefore , you can add a help page with information about the use of accesskeys with diverse browsers . Or ? <p> &gt; The first thing to notice is that wats.ca do n't  really know what they 're talking about . <p> Ahem <p> We acknolwedge and have now stated the fact that Opera does not use the Alt + keystroke combination to implement Accesskeys on the Keystroke conflict resource page of our site . It was an editorial oversight rather than a lack of " knowing what we are talking about " ( Curiously , many proponents of Accesskeys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ site accesskeys , also use the phrase " Alt + " , when in fact depending on the browser and/or OS , it may in fact be something completely different - right Mac users ? ) <p> However to set the record straight ( and in the interest of completion ) , in Opera , to activate a letter accesskey , you hold down Shift + Esc + letter . When using numbers on the other hand , you must press Shift + Esc , let go , and then press the number . <p> We continue to stand by our overarching position though , that Accesskeys are a failure in their implementation and usability/accessibility and that the development community ( that 's us , guys and gals ) need to come up with a better alternative . <p> Just discovered this interesting article/discussion while composing a posting on macosxhints about accesskeys in Safari . Ill just copy+paste most of that here : <p> Anyone here know how to disable accesskeys in Safari ? They interfere with " emacs-style " control key shortcuts I frequently use while composing messages on several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ post " instead of moving to the previous line . Or control-b inserts bold UBB code markers . Even worse , I 've accidentally posted something that couldnt be edited or deleted without even realizing which accesskey did it . <p> One option for Safari might be to disable accesskeys while keyboard focus is in a text input widget ( or whatever its called ) , but this ai n't  my area of expertise so I 'm not sure if that 's the " right " thing to do or if the current behavior might actually be a bug . <p> Unfortunately that 's not true , per my example . Its my main issue ( and gripe ) with accesskeys in Safari . Bug or not , they 've downgraded my browser usability , apparently without any immediate recourse . Same may hold true for OmniWeb 5 , which I 'll be checking soon now that this topic has interrupted me . <p> I find that one of the facets lacking in the discussion of Access Keys is that of Internationalization ( I18N ) . I recently worked on a project where we were converting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same dialogs . Originally , we used Access Keys to provide some quick and easy functionality . However , we found in our necessity to internationalize , we were forced to completely remove the access key properties . <p> After all , " Done " button in one dialog could be translated to " Fin " in the French version . The original use of Ctrl-D no longer has any meaning to a French user . Thus , I consider that the need to internationalize sites and provide multiple language options also creates an issue in relation to the use of Access Keys . <p> ( I 'm only replying to this now as I 've come across this post from one of Dereks articles mentioned above. ) 30455 @qwx890455 30451 @qwx890451 <p> You are reading " I Do Not Use Accesskeys " , an entry posted on 29 December , 2003 , to the 1066 collection .

@@99593549 @3793549/ <p> Were stuck with Internet Explorer for the next 3 years bare minimum , most likely 6 . Let 's start thinking about how we can move forward . <p> Ive been considering enhancing my work somehow for browsers that can support it , and I 'm not the only one . Steve Champeon , Mike Pick , and CodeBitch have all discussed the idea . <p> We now have a method and an example . View my latest Zen Garden entry , mnemonic for the example ; carry on reading for my method , which I dub Mozilla/Opera/Safari Enhancement , or MOSe for short . <p> MOSe relies on IE6s inability to pick up child and adjacent selectors , or &gt; and + as they 're known by . As well , some basic CSS3 selectors are becoming more and more usable in everything but IE ( see CodeBitchs CSS3 support chart ) so we can use these to our advantage as well . <p> The key to the method is somewhat similar to how NN4 page design developed as CSS became more prevalent after creating a basic , functioning page @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . While IE cant render them , at least it does n't  make a half-hearted attempt to and come short . And that 's way better than what we had to put up with to make things work in NN4 . <p> Ill leave application of MOSe as an exercise to the reader . Pick apart mnemonic and see a few ways it can be done . You can start at the spec , but for the sake of your Googling , here is a nonexhaustive list of CSS2 selectors you 'll want to pay special attention to , thanks to their support in MOS and nonsupport in IE : <p> There are bound to be more that are MOSefriendly. : root , : first-child , : focus , and possibly : not look promising , although the latter is buggy in IE5 . <p> The point is to provide IE a way out by using CSS it has no hope of understanding . This is the only way we can keep moving forward in the next few years . Let 's embrace it . <p> ( okay , I realize I say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ latest bleedingedge tricks , " but you can see how this is an exception . As well , I realize that some things might be funky on Mac browsers I hear it renders alright , but I ca n't guarantee there 's no weirdness going on. ) 30454 @qwx890454 <p> This sounds like a prime idea ; and using that Newtedge tip to hide CSS from IE might be the perfect way to do it . Maybe we could see the revival of some IE-targeted " ahem " text blurbs , so popular during the once-great browser upgrade campaign ? <p> Pretty much what I was getting at Ethan - though I was n't around when this happened the first time , and I would imagine that the scale of the situation is much different now I just have this feeling that something is doable . <p> Dave , I should have said this earlier but it slipped . That 's an awesome new design you 've got up on the site . Very well done ! ! <p> Let 's think more long-term on this . Destructive reasoning against IE is n't going to solve any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Instead , let 's address why a user might want Opera , or Mozilla . Sell a new browser to them by luring , do n't  shame them into upgrading . <p> Dave couldnt agree more . I do n't  think we need to ( or can , or should ) start griping about IE to our users ; rather , educating them on the advantages of other browsers seems to be the best way out of this . Maybe instead of hijacking users pages with garish " upgrade now " messages in 400% red type , we could simply style an unobstrusive paragraph visible only to IE users ? Something along the lines of " have you considered " ? <p> Ethan , masadelante , your hearts are in the right place . Its tempting to think that a pro-MOS campaign is the right thing to do , especially when considered against an anti-IE campaign . And it seems there are a lot of developers who would agree with you . <p> Except what developers think in this case does n't  matter much . Ive been through this already - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then my pitch sparked enthusiastic support , which caught the attention of Zeldman who gave very considered and valid reasons against such a campaign , which made sense , although it was frustrating to acknowledge . Bryan Bell picked up on it recently , and there are plenty of other designers out there who feel the same way , but as Jeffrey said - no sense in tilting at windmills . Apple has millions to throw at their unsuccessful Switch campaign , and we do n't  have nearly that budget . <p> The major browser vendors will settle this one , not the developers . The best thing you can do is support their efforts . Buy a copy of Opera and put your money where your mouth is . Pitch in a hand over at Mozilla . Get your friends and family to buy from Apple so they can run Safari . Help them , do n't  help the web development community . That 's the way to make a difference . <p> Dave makes a lot of sense to me . At the end of your day , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been so frustrating of late . For all its drawbacks , the BUC at least afforded us the chance to act but as you say , being stuck with IE6 is worlds better than NS4 . <p> And thanks for showing how you 've come to your current thinking , too ; I 'd seen Zeldmans post , but had missed out on your previous articles until today . Seeing the whole thread was really helpful . <p> I have long said that IE 5 was the Netscape 4 of a new generation . That was before IE 6 stagnated , of course . This is great stuff ! <p> Question : is there any way of hiding entire stylesheets from IE 6 ? That might make it easier to manage . Have a " basic " for NN4 , " modern " for IE , and " advanced " for **37;1967;TOOLONG . <p> I had taken your no ( or not too much ) CSS2 too literally , and had thought that there was n't too much scope to get away from the " blocky " look .. <p> Mark re&gt;&gt; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but using an IE conditional statement to call an IE stylesheet might be one way to " keep it seperate " although the cascade would still have to be observed . So calling it before importing the " advanced one " might be one way if main elements are similar .. alternatively calling it after the @import could lend a way to make a totally different page for it .. <p> mnemonic is generating several errors . i do n't  know if there is a different version of the CSS validator that would allow some of the new CSS rules you are using to pass . regardless , to link to a different validator would require changing the HTML anyway , which is not allowed . <p> while i agree that pushing the envelope is a great way to move things forward , i do n't  think that the simple tenets of the CSS garden project should be ignored to do so . <p> Great tips , Tom . That should pretty much answer Marks question - either use the xhtml hack to selectively load the . css , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on everything . Obviously you could drop it if you were using one of the other methods of selection . <p> The idea of enhancing the page for Mozilla/Opera/Safari has been something I started doing in small ways about nine months ago . One of the first things I did was used : hover on the breadcrumbs ; normally the text would be washed out but when you mouse-over the text would become much bolder in color . I think it is a nice effect because it let 's the main text stand out more on the page . <p> &gt;&gt;which caught the attention of Zeldman who gave very considered and valid reasons against such a campaign <p> Personally , I could n't see anything other than a bad argument in Zeldmans comments : " you wo n't eliminate IE , therefore do nothing . " That 's a good argument ? <p> Its very easy using advanced css to add a suggested browser link ( along with all your other suggested links and whatever else you suggest on your site ) for lesser browsers , not just IE , and a thank you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one below . No effort required . Wont change the world , but nice to help a bit . <p> I like the idea of advanced selectors adding to a page , and use them myself . I do n't  wish to be a stick in the mud , but what am I missing on the zen entry ? I see the two columns on the right vs. one column , and some image replacement which I imagine can be done for lesser browsers anyway . Actually looks a bit nicer to me in IE ; - ) <p> There is a more gental aproach to hide css from MSIE6.0 . Ironically it uses the same hiding method which was used for NN4.x : Hide CSS from IE up to version 6.0 . Newt Edge has a lot more intresting CSS tricks . <p> Do extra special things with the features that IE does n't  support ( design , extra pics , neat layouts ) but keep your site plain but functional in IE. If this becomes a design trend , it will reward the people who download and use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for grandma &amp; junior to want to get more functional browsers then either Microsoft will have to keep up or other standards compliant browsers will gain usage . <p> I definitely agree that putting those little enhancements for " advanced " browsers is the key . Things wo n't look bad in IE , but theyll look better in Moz/Safari/Opera . Another tactic I 've installed in some of my newer sites is a little ASP.NET user control that checks to see if the browser is IE/NN4/Opera6 and displays a small " text ad " encouraging windows users to check out the great features of Opera 7 and MozFirebird , and Safari for mac users . I like the ASP.NET control because it dosent render text that would show up on CSS-ignoring browsers , and I can customize the ad for mac or pc . Ill share it if people would like . <p> &gt;&gt;The problem is that all of the text will be displayed in browsers that ignore CSS ( Lynx , Opera with styles turned off ) . <p> Yeah , but I guess the practical response is : who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side-by-side . No big deal . Its not navigation or anything critical . <p> &gt;&gt;Do extra special things with the features that IE does n't  support ( design , extra pics , neat layouts ) but keep your site plain but functional in IE. <p> I think this is mis-stated somewhat . The idea is not , in my opinion , to go out of the way to add things that IE wont see . It is more so to code as you can , taking advantage of css2 , then make it work as well as possible in IE by adding in IE hacks via extra styles in conditional comments , js add-on for min-max , etc. , which can all be easily updated/removed later . No more god-awful hacks in your style sheet ! Write it all nice and clean , then do some IE clean-up in separate files . <p> Dave , I just wanted to weigh in and say nice work for making a go against teh browser hegemony . : D <p> Its funny , I 've been talking a lot , as you mentioned , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can write CSS the first time and make it work without hacking after the fact , since I write for Gecko/standards first generally - such is the lot of the Mac user . <p> I even like the name , although it is n't quite accurate - a substitution needs to be made for Mozilla because Gecko is engine that is actually powering the browsers . GOSe ? <p> Ive been using this MOSe trick for a few months now on my own site . It works like a dream . Now I 'm looking at adding multiple selectors in a single class attribute . This is an option to make pages more semantic and to use the selectors more as objects rather that being context specific . <p> I have been working on an a menu that is hidden by default but when you hover over the label you get a menu bar with graphical icons that grow and overlap the other icons when you hover over them . You need use a current Gecko browser.

Short summary : Project Blogger is looking to pay weblog publishers willing to hawk merchandise . <p> Its easy to get sucked into the " everybody is doing it " mentality that surrounds weblogs today . But they 're not . Poll 25 random people on the street . 1 or 2 of them might have a LiveJournal or a BlogSpothosted diary if you 're lucky . Even they probably have n't heard of Movable Type or Blogger . <p> Blogger has just reached the million users mark . That 's one million web logs , that 's not one million people . I 'd guess a maximum 400k individual people . Are they all keeping active logs ? I doubt it . If Blogger sees one hundred thousand posts a week systemwide I 'd be impressed . <p> Where am I going with all this ? It should be obvious . The numbers are n't  attractive to advertisers . Why put up $10k or so on such a small audience , a technically savvy audience who can generally tell when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ highprofile attempts in the next few months , but the idea is n't going to catch on . <p> Yet . <p> The weblog is still the playground of the technically savvy . This is changing though , and wont be true for long ( reference : all the 14 year olds posting about their crushes on LiveJournal ) . The masses will pick up on the idea sooner or later . The internet was a playground for geeks not too long ago , now everybodys grandmother has an email address . <p> Even when the numbers start looking good enough to make this idea profitable , the people Project Blogger requires to deliver its message are , well , just people . Some will be far more interesting than most , and as with any medium a natural hierarchy will sort out and certain people will be considered authoritive. ( reference : Jason Kottke ) Those are the ones that will be most attractive to advertisers . And they 're also the ones who may have to pursue ways to pay off the higher bandwidth costs their popularity has caused . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this before . This is exactly what happened to early independent content publishers on the web , and today we happily accept that ads are a small price to pay for continued use of their sites . Since were so obviously not willing to pay . ( reference : recent rumours of Salons yettoactuallyhappen closure ) <p> Itll happen again with weblogs . And well grumble , and moan , and accept . Weblogs were a shot in the arm for the increasing consolidation of major web content publishers , but they will inevitably follow the same path . This is just the start . <p> ( All numbers are blind guesses due to lack of information or the motivation to seek it .

@@99593551 @3793551/ <p> The URL csszengarden.com forwards you to mezzoblue.com/zengarden , which effectively breaks the back button . I did n't  realize this was happening ! I definitely would n't have chosen that way on purpose ; when I figure out what to do about hosting , I 'm hoping the domain will be the final URL instead of a forward . <p> The issue of font scaling has popped up a few times now . <p> For me , some of the designs that are posted are hard to use because I normally scale fonts up . arch4.20 and Stormweather suffer when this is done to them . I hope that font scaling and different user base fonts will be considered normal uses that designers are expected to take into account . <p> Michael Croft <p> I think I screwed up on that point . I 'm so used to coding font sizes as pixels ( and since IE6/Win does n't  allow you to resize hard pixel values ) that in my testing I never think to fool around with font size and see what breaks . <p> Part of the problem in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gracefully , images cant . Its inconsequential to tell a box with only a background colour to grow as text scales , but it gets a whole lot harder when that box has to fit inside another box that only has so much room . <p> This is one of the problems with CSS as a design language its either all or nothing where fonts are concerned . Its a perfectly valid design requirement to constrain text within a certain area ; if CSS provided a way to say " resize all fonts but these ones " then the problem is eliminated . Short of serving all your text as an image , there just is n't a way to do this right now . <p> Any designer worth his or her salt will agree with that point ; font scaling needs to be taken into account . But its a giveandtake process , and you cant expect him or her to cater to every contingency . There 's no way I 'm going to be able to make my pixelvalue background images work if someone chooses to browse at textsize 300% . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my entire design is done with them , I can provide an alternative . If someone chooses to surf at 300% , theyll have the option of a different stylesheet which does n't  break . It may not be as pretty , but at least they can get to my content . <p> This is probably the best of both worlds . I will give you what I think is my most effective design by default . If you have problems with it , I will give you an alternative or two to chose from that will hopefully clear up those problems . Its tough being all things to everyone ; its substantially easier when there 's a choice involved . 30454 @qwx890454 <p> There is one saying that can be applied to many professions and walks of life and that is " You cant please all of the people , all of the time " . Sometimes you have to draw the line . <p> You are right about providiing a seperate stylesheet for people who want text at 300% but I personally think that browser vendors should make it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the end of the day , they are a valid size definition and easier to work with ( in my opinion ) . <p> " if CSS provided a way to say " resize all fonts but these ones " then the problem is eliminated . " <p> But CSS does have this , as you mentioned . You define your fixed size text in px and your relative size in em . On Mozilla the user is going to be able to resize pixels , but that is the fault of the design community who got lazy and decided to do everything in pixels rather than taking 10 minutes to figure out ems . <p> The reason Mozilla ( and others ) allows resizing of px-based text is because as ridiculous as it sounds , according to the W3 spec px is a relative unit , not a fixed pixel width . ( source ) <p> I think Opera is doing it best , from a design standpoint . You get your whole page scaled up , rather than just your font . There 's no way designers will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their images remain fixed - that breaks proportions and throw alignments off ; not a good thing . <p> actually that was one of my gripes about how html has been evolving . we have yet to see primary layers being able to tell secondary layers to adjust its size/position according to the primary . this feature has been built into flash , but not html . <p> surprisingly , there are methods to achieve this results through javascript unfortunately , the JS needed to achieve this effect is n't supported by all browsers. the evolution of html has been such an embarassment when compared to flash . sooo teh ghey . <p> I think the point of this is being missed . People that view a font at 300% know that they are n't  getting the page displayed the way it was meant to be displayed . I second the comment that you cant please all the people . My point is that I do n't  think having a design slightly fall apart with text at 300% displeases anyone really . <p> I agree with Dave S - Opera does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> IMHO , the way of the future would be to use ems , or similar relative lengths for defining the image sizes . Then the browser should scale them as it scales text . SVG would fit in well with this , although bitmaps would look rough unless the browser has a good quality scaling algorithm <p> I 've struggled with the font sizing in my design submittal it really is a pain to deal with , and me thinks someone should just change their screen resolution if they have a hard time seeing the words , that 's basically the effect opera creates anyway <p> to Michael who said a person should just change screen resolutions , that 's just insane . As a designer , I work in 1600x1200 to get max space for work , when I surf , every site seems to use a font size of 2 , which is very hard to read , which is why I have used opera for a long time . Since making the switch to css-based design , my main priority is that the site scales , because I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I do n't  want them to experience that on my sites . Of course , there 's no 100% solution - I still have n't figured out why opera zooms up to 1000 - but I make sure all my designs are liquid , so that they scale as nice as possible , because a huge percentage of the world does n't  like to squint to read their screens , it is a priority . The content is what is important , not how I think it should be displayed . That 's the problem from the start , designers wanting to force their design on the audience . Liquid is the way to go , I 'm tired of all the small text , especially in obscenely cluttered commercial sites that are a jungle to sort through , and break easy when you zoom a bit Font scaleability should be a primary design concern . <p> I experimented with a css zen garden design and then realized that scaling my fonts to 150% would screw up my image-based design in Mozilla . <p> I got to thinking about the nature of design @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those arenas , causing severe problems when one focuses on one or the other , usually design . In my case , the Design suffers because font sizes are necessitated by image backgrounds and particular div layouts . <p> Most of us ARE NT designing our sites for a CSS Zen Garden-like existence , which hinges pretty nearly solely on design . However , after doing a design of my own , I begin to question the overall effectiveness of CSS Zen Garden when designers must disrupt the " feng shui " of their work to accomodate what essentially boils down to a user functional issue . <p> That 's not to say function is n't important - it is - but since Zen Garden is a Design experiment , my hindsight desire is to sublimate function under design . Font sizes be damned ! <p> Nobodys going to change their screen resolution when using an lcd screen . LDC screens are made for one screen resolution only . And a lot of laptops these days have 1400x1000 or even 1600x1000 on 14 or 15 inch screens . You can not use those without increasing font sizes .

All these fiddly little last-minute details , and were still not quite ready to take registrations just yet . ( Very , very close , but not quite 100% yet ) . <p> Anyway , here it is . Web Directions , the very conference that starts today in Sydney Australia , is coming to Canada early next year . I 'm very pleased to be a part of bringing this great event to my home city , Vancouver . We 've got a great speaker lineup , and two days of post-conference skiing/snowboarding planned at Whistler , one of the future 2010 Winter Olympics venues . It promises to be a fantastic time for everyone coming . <p> Mark your calendars , and make sure to get your name on the mailing list ; the first 100 people to confirm their registrations get a special discount . Add it to your Upcoming list while you 're at it . <p> I wish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take place at a time better for those of us who do a lot of government contracts . That 's a really tough period to get away , when all of the work is due before year in March . <p> Great job , guys . Really looks like a great conference and a great lineup of speakers . I wish I could be there , but I do n't think I can afford both it and SXSW ( and I 'm already registered for SXSW ) . Maybe next year <p> Anyway , thanks for adding one more great conference to the annual schedule ! <p> Geof , that 's an interesting point . We certainly want to facilitate government attendees as much as possible , and we did talk about ways to make that happen . <p> Problem was , given that the holidays push into January , and SXSW is in March , and anything after that would n't have worked for the Whistler after-party , our time frame was pretty well decided for us this time round . <p> I would sure have liked to go other other conferences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because of the money involved . <p> But this is not far from home : I just need to get on the ferry from Victoria to Vancouver , and I 'd be there ! The line up of speakers is looking good , some that I 've wanted to meet ( or see in person ) for a long time ! <p> But I 'll have the money to spare , and this is looking like a good opportunity for a first conference to attend ! <p> As I 'm still a bit undecided about SXSW at this point for 07 , this might be a good alternative . A bonus being not having to deal with currency exchange and maybe a chance to get Grant to finally hand over some long overdue Veer buttons ; - ) <p> Just out of curiosity , why is the cost so high ? The regular price for the conference is $995Admittedly , there are discounts if you sign up soon enough , but still , why so much ? Is it the cost of space at the hotel , or the catering ? Then there 's the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm not complaining - I 'm seriously leaning towards going , if I can spare the money , and I 'm sure others would happily spend that much money for two days of meet and greet . <p> Exactly why its in Vancouver ; time to get more stuff happening out in our neck of the woods , Torontos so obvious ! <p> " Just out of curiosity , why is the cost so high ? The regular price for the conference is $995 " <p> A few reasons , but the big one is simply venue . Anyone else on the organizing committee can attest to this , we looked long and hard in this city for space that would work for what we wanted to do , and the only ones matching the bill were hotels set up to run conferences . Hotels are in the business of making a profit , so the costs are dramatically higher than those of a university campus , or even likely those of a dedicated conference centre . <p> However that said , if you compare to similar-sized conferences around the world ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prices are comparable . We did our research , we know were in the right ballpark . <p> Ohhhh ! I spent 9/7 thru 9/15 @ Whistler , Vancouver and Seattle for vacation . Whistler is really , really fun even in the off season . They fill to capacity in February . LOVED Vancouver as well , Robson St. and Chinatown are tonsa fun . They were/are filming Fantastic Four2 , in Vancouver when we were there . <p> Having just come out of Web Directions South , I can only recommend this northern version to anyone who has an interest in where the web is going . I thought the predecessor conferences in Sydney in 04 ( thanks Dave , Doug , Joe etc ) and 05 ( thanks Eric , Jeffrey , Molly , Derek etc ) were outstanding but this one topped even those . Andy Clarke was totally inspiring . Kelly Goto is so practical . Derek Featherstone reminds me why access to the web should be universal . Mike Pesces closing session just about lifted my head off . <p> To answer some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well as freelancers ( like myself ) , agencies , govt depts , corporations , non-profits and SMEs . I 've never made a deal at one of these things but Ive come out of each with resources and inspiration that has had a direct and measurable effect on how I work and what Ive achieved each year . There 's no way I 'd be getting the jobs I get now if not for Kellys sessions on work flow and user testing or Jeffrey Veens sessions on working with clients . I would n't understand how standards came about , why CSS matters , the evolution of javascript or that Australia has as many people pushing the web boundaries as anywhere else in the world ( we get a little self-deprecating about these things down under , ysee ) . <p> The big thing for me is that a conference like this places what I do in context , pushes me to achieve more and convinces me that I 'm capable of it . <p> I 'd describe it more as a series of presentations by industry professionals focused on specific aspects of web @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( although that seems too stern a word ) . There 's chatting and stuff between the sessions and in the evenings at drinks or dinner , but the sessions themselves are very focused on the topic . <p> For me , it brought some of the high falutin aspects of geeks immersed in obscure code back to earth by showing the presenters to be ordinary people who have become adept at particular things : CSS , APIs , javascript , working with clients , browser limitations , finding design inspiration , microformats , whatever . <p> A kind of undercurrent theme at the Southern version was " What does Web 2.0 mean anyway , if anything ? " And there were some answers , or at least points of view . <p> That kind of thing becomes an easy topic of conversation with other attendees , and presenters if you can collar them between sessions . <p> I 've never been to any of the planned social events or post-session drinkies ( you know , wife &amp; kids , travel home , work and all that ) , but I still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that became friends and/or colleagues . <p> There are probably lots of conferences where that happens - this series just hits the right buttons for me . <p> Small example - every conference has had at least two sessions on accessibility for people with disabilities , simply because universal access is an underpinning principle that the organisers truly believe in . That fits with the way I think . <p> I have what I suppose is an ironic question , considering that there may be resentations on accessibility for the diabledWill the conference itself be accessible ? <p> I ask because I am hard of hearing , and have difficulty following presentations in large rooms with lots of people , especially when there is interactive discussion going on between the presenter and attendees . <p> I could sit close to the front - that 's a typical first step for me , but there are other things to help as well Will there be loudspeakers ? Transcripts ? Something to make the actual presentations more accessible to the hard of hearing ? <p> I 'd sure like to attend , but am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and such . <p> Grant , I also have a hearing impairment . The Sydney session presenters were radio-miked and easily audible to me sitting in the middle of the auditorium . <p> During q&amp;a ( always in one lot at the end of the session ) , presenters repeated questions from the audience so that everyone knew what the question was . <p> Post-session , podcasts are being made available as well speakers presentation notes . <p> Given the involvement of Derek Featherstone as an organiser , I 'd be pretty confident WDN will use both technological and procedural means to address as many accessibility issues as possible . As his own session made clear , accessibility is not about meeting pro forma checklists , its personal . <p> Mention your specific needs when you register so the organisers can address them or let you know if they cant . <p> Re Jeans question , its perfectly possible that the presenters go over stuff you already know .

@@99593553 @3793553/ <p> An interesting conversation with Jay Allen the other day got me thinking about how I cope with larger amounts of email . Not well , it turns out . <p> Despite the plethora of Nigerian scams and email-spread virii floating around at the moment , I 've noticed my spam levels are at all-time lows . Which means the signal-to-noise ratio in my inbox is quite high , which also means that waking up to the sack of new mail that came in overnight is a daunting prospect . <p> Its amazing how the internet is bringing together people who might have not otherwise meet ; and there are a hell of a lot of them . It seems the more active you are online , the more people want a moment of your time . A five minute email response , multiplied by 50 , equals a whole afternoon spent catching up . Every week . Matts policy of replying to every email received is admirable , but it does n't  scale . ( I tried too . ) <p> Making yourself available for discussion is not a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be reached between you and those wishing to get in touch . Its a two-way road ; you need to agree to be as responsive as possible , they need to agree to be selective as possible . <p> For what its worth , my strategy of keeping things managable at the moment goes something like this . This all applies exclusively to email coming in off this site and that other one , but not to previously-established communication or work-related email . Your mileage may vary depending on volume . <p> New email is read ( or at the very least , skimmed ) as soon as it arrives . If it requires a follow-up , its either replied to immediately , or marked as unread . ( I rely on unread instead of flagged messages , so that my mail folders give me a count of how many outstanding messages I need to get to . ) <p> I do n't  answer many CSS questions anymore , instead referring the asker on to the excellent css-discuss list . That 's what its there for , and if it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of me anytime you ran into a rendering glitch , well youd certainly hear much less from me on here , for starters . <p> I start with the low-hanging fruit . Any email that requires a quick line or two in reply will get a response within a day or two , be it " thanks " or any other acknowledgement/question . Those are no problem , and so far I can generally reply to every one , usually quickly . <p> It gets thorny when email requires either a bit of thinking , a bit of debating , or a bit of digging into archives , Google or elsewhere to formulate a reply . Some of these I get to in short order , others sit for a while . I try not to leave them for over a month , but it happens . The problem with replying to them is that when it comes time to do so , I 'll have another new set of email to get to first , and once again the low-hanging fruit principle comes into effect . These can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I get the occasional email that spans multiple on-screen pages . I absolutely love that someone has taken the time to share that much with me ; I feel a message that long deserves a considered response , which can end up being a page or two back . Finding the time to write that page is difficult . Again , low-hanging fruit is picked first most times . I always reply to these essays ; I do n't  always reply to them in a timely manner . <p> Email that ends up jumping the queue tends to be well thought out and will raise good points that I 'd like to address more publicly . Ill follow up with a response , and then post an edited version of that email on here . ( No , this is n't one of those . ) I 'd rather take the time I spend writing to build a publicly-available response for more than a single person . <p> What keeps me replying instead of just marking them all as read and letting them disappear into the ether ? I value the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into your query . I 'll keep on replying to as many as I can . <p> Addendum : I 've read along the way that a good time management habit is to set aside a period for email , and only have your mail client open during that time . Its something I 'm considering ; at the moment I leave it running all day . Whether that would help me answer more email , or lessen the distraction that new email causes , or both , I 'm not sure . 30454 @qwx890454 <p> I 've had my occasional times in some fairly small spotlights online ( most recently with coffeefaucet.com ) and the deluges of email that can result are remarkable . <p> With that in mind , I try not to write anybody famous or semi-famous is that I do n't  send any communication unless I have something either very specific to them or very important to tell/ask them . The advantage of weblogs is I often find out things I 've idly wondered about but not felt important enough to ask by just waiting around and reading . <p> For a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always been forums . My personal way is this : <p> 3 Email addresses that get sorted on arrival , 1 ) For family , friends , etc. 2 ) For work associates , the people I love to ignore 3 ) For websites that could redistribute it ( aka , my spam email ) <p> Then , with my websites , I create forums where people can ask their questions . Ill reply there if it something that requires my attention , otherwise if its an easy answer , I let the other members of the forum handle it . I would bet that would cut back on the number of CSS questions youd get in the mail , mainly because no one would have that email address . <p> The downfall comes if you desire for anyone to be able to contact you easily . <p> I 'm definitely with Jon in that if I do n't  respond immediately then it can be a while before I get to it at all . I also use different email addresses and filters to help me decide which emails are more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spam filters work pretty well for me as well which definitely helps on the noise to signal ratio . <p> Fortunately , I 'm sure I do n't  receive anywhere near the same amount of email as you guys <p> That 's pretty much my method too . I respond to everything , but sometimes it takes a few months . The record is 14 . Also while replying to every last one is my intention and goal I strive for , I 'm sure someone will pipe up " Matt never responded to me ! " and theyll probably be right . Email was heavy before , and WordPress has increased it by an order of magnitude . They tend to be the emails that require some thought when replying too . <p> I think turning off the e-mail client is a bad idea . A better idea is to figure out what e-mail you KNOW can wait , and teach your mail client to filter it out of the way , so it does , in fact , wait . and perhaps create a special place for " read this now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough to leave e-mail alone until a certain time , and then leave everything else alone during " email time " . besides , some things wo n't wait , like that hot stock tip , or word that your niece is getting married . <p> So compromise by figuring what you do n't  have to deal with right now , and do n't  . And your mail client can be a huge help there , with a little training . <p> Your strategy is pretty much the same as mine , Dave . I do a truckload of filtering and scrubbing as mail comes in bayesian and white/blacklist filtering for spam , mailing lists get their own folders , certain keywords flag messages with colored labels , etc . I keep hearing people pushing that strategy of setting aside particular times for checking email , too , but those people must only get a handful of messages in a day . There 's no way I could handle my email load if I did n't  chip away at it all day . <p> Also , my spam levels are certainly not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week is 3,856 spams out of 4,477 total messages . I 'd be happy to send you some of mine if you 're feeling left out . <p> Much of it still applies , but the spam-avoidance techniques are so nanve they seem quaint now . <p> I do have to find a day every few months to weed through my unsorted e-mail ( replied-to and not ) . Right now there are &gt;1000 in my Entourage Inbox , and its time to get them squared away . Luckily , these days , with Pobox , Telus ( personal ) or NetNation ( work ) , and Spamfire all filtering my mail in sequence , I get very , very little spam anymore . <p> I tried doing the whole set-time period thing , but the problem there is that I use Entourage , and its my notebook/address book/scheduler , too . If I closed Entourage in an attempt to stay focussed , within five minutes I 'd need to open it again . I am a forgetful little weenie and I need crutches . <p> When I get a message that wants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ response that says I 'm really sorry but I 'll get around to it later , and then I make an Entourage event with a reminder ( crutches again ! ) . There 's an AppleScript that just copies the entire message into a calendar event , and then I can just set a reminder to rely to this message for the next day , weekend , or whenever seems appropriate . Entourage makes links between the message and the event , too , so I can just click a wee button and the related message(s) appear . <p> Oh , boy I love to hate my email . I just switched from Eudora to Mail.app and in the process imported over 30,000 messages . Yes , I am a pack rat . However , I am proud to say that right now , there are less than 100 emails in my all of my inboxes combined that need replying to to require some action . That 's a lot , you may say , but not when you consider that last week , I had over 500 . And that 's not counting all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daily . <p> What got Dave and I talking about this is information overload . We both have not only have over 125 subscriptions to syndication feeds that are updated on average a hundred times per week each , but also tides email , throngs of instant messenger contacts , at least one cell phone and the entire damn global interweb thing that ai n't  getting any smaller or less prolific in the production department . Did I mention the fact that we also work ? ! <p> I 'm in the same camp as Jon Hicks ( #4 ) and Chris Pederick ( #7 ) in that if I do n't  take action immediately , whatever it was will probably not get done for a long while . I would love to be able to schedule checking email at work , since most of my day is spent programming and a break in concentration can sometimes be devastating . Another benefit would be pooling actionable emails so nothing gets overlooked ; for example , if a simple request is made during an intense coding session , sometimes those emails do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get overlooked increases . <p> Unfortunately , one of the largest applications I maintain communicates problems via email . So , if a query misfires or a server craps out , that will always need immediate action and take precedence over anything else , requiring that I leave email open all day . In addition to that concern , which is already managed to a certain extent by filters and separate email accounts , is the more tangible benefit of looking good . The people I work with really do appreciate timely responses , and getting known for being attentive and diligent is not a bad rep to have . <p> Jay Allens point ( #17 ) puts the email burden in context , however , because he reminds us that email is not the only source of **25;2006;TOOLONG . Cell phones , IM , MT comment-notification , syndications and so on are also disturbances that serve to compound the email dilemma . Personally , I found I had to consolidate the means of receiving information at work into manageable streams of email and phone only ( note : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time to surf and catch up more personal matters . This would n't work for everyone . Obviously having a high-volume , very popular and respected website *in addition* to work-related responsibilities would certainly put a crimp in this scheme . <p> This does n't  have so much to do with email management , but more so with spam filtering . Since this has drifted a little of course anyway , I do n't  feel bad bringing this up . I found this service which allows you to set up an infinite number of alias email addresses which point to a single main address . <p> Every time I fill out a new form , I hop over to MailNull and create a new email address to match the site where the form originates . I 've got just over 30 aliases currently , and see no end in site . Its a free service that is ran from the guys home , so its surely in the beginning stages . <p> If used properly ( I know , geeks only ) , you can easily discover which sites are selling your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ based on which address they are sent to . <p> None of this will help if you have your email address plastered over websites near and far the main source of spam , IMO . <p> I have also found this service especially useful when changing my email address ( change of ISP ) . I simply modify the main email address ( which all my aliases point to ) to reflect any new changes and Im done . No need to run all over the web , editing my user account information . That in itself is reason enough to use this service . <p> Its a completely different approach to handling spam , with advantages that go far beyond its intended purpose . I loved it the minute I discovered it . <p> Justin , Do you know what MTA they use at mailnull.com and what header contains the " original envelope To " header ? I 'm wary of any disposable address company that does n't  have a clear explanation about the fact that you need to filter on the original envelope and that the To and Cc @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mailnull.com address that was used . <p> Anyway , about email management : I try to get people to post to gmane.org.infiniteink rather than sending me private email . Unfortunately , that experiment is n't working too well <p> Maybe a good solution is to move to having a regular time that you are posting in an open forum area . Where people can come in and ask questions , or have a set time each day/week/month where you will be answering questions in the newsgroups . <p> That would be nice . Another benefit is that it keeps the knowledge open to all , aka your answers . <p> Nancy , I do n't  about the MTA . I do n't  think I know what that is , or at least the acronym : ) <p> MailNull is not some random company that hands out email addresses . It was created by a concerned and creative developer who was dissatisfied with the current spam handling capabilities . Look into the service and feel free to send him an inquiry about his techniques , I 'm sure hed be happy to help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my old address ( allowing me to migrate away at my own pace ) . It also makes it very easy to file reports that include the FTC . The Internet Fraud Complaint Center still requires manual form-filling , so I have stopped filing.http : //www.ifccfbi.gov 30455 @qwx890455 30451 @qwx890451 <p> You are reading " Email Management " , an entry posted on 7 April , 2004 , to the Porte collection .

@@99593554 @3793554/ <p> Its that time again , but things are a little different . Web Directions North returns for another year of conferencing and skiing in early February , but its now taking place in Denver , Colorado . And I 'm not involved . Well I am , kind of , but <p> One day I intend to sit down and write up the trials and tribulations , the things Ive learned , and some of the fantastic experiences I 've had over the past few years as one of the primary organizers of what , by almost all accounts , was a fantastic set of web conferences . Suffice it to say that building WDN with John , Maxine , and Derek was one of the highlights of my professional career thus far . <p> But it was also a lot of work . So much work . After the first year in 2007 I had suspicions , then the frenzy of activity leading up to the second year in early 2008 really confirmed it : running an event of this size is a full time job , and its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long term . Though it turns out Im actually quite good at event planning ( who knew ? ) , that alone did n't  feel like enough reason to ignore the stress of making ticket sales or the difficulty in turning away long term clients for a few months out of every year . So , I had an honest talk with the others , wished them luck , and decided to bow out for future years . <p> And that 's it really . Sorry to be boring , there was n't a big dramatic falling out and we still get along great . In fact John asked me to come speak in Denver , and I 'm happy to be doing so . At the very least it should prove an interesting reversal to sit back and enjoy the conference this year , without the prior stress of putting it all together . <p> So if you want to come join us , and I think you should because John has pulled out all the stops to build a really compelling program with a lot of exciting speakers , go sign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ price you 're at it with the code WDN09DSh . <p> WHAT ? Thats IT ? I demand you go back and do it all over , only this time with a massive booze- and anger-soaked falling-out worthy of the Motley Cr++e episode of " Behind the Music " . Totaled sports car optional . <p> Sadly we never managed to line up investors that I could embezzle from , so there 's no sports car to total . But while in Denver I suppose I could make a few Yo Momma jokes at Johns expense and see what happens . <p> Sounds like it was a really good experience , over all . But I totally respect knowing when you need to draw the line and bow out . I 'm totally looking forward to hanging when you come to my turf for WDN . <p> Nice post , and I love Erics comment as well . Its funny , only yesterday afternoon I was at home organising a few papers and found a copy of the WDN08 program . Flicking through it , and remembering how , in those final frenzied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ content , writing some of it yourself , doing the design , getting it to the printers etc etc etc , and I thought to myself " what a damn fine job Dave did of this ! " : ) <p> It is kind of interesting conference . It is quite similar to Orielly WEB2.0 conference . I went last year to San francisco WEB 2.0 , and i did not like it . I met people who said WDN08 we better than WEB2.0 , and it was even cheaper registration fee , which matters for me since i am student . <p> As a seasoned WD connoisseur , I can attest that WDN08 was fantastic . I for one am still reaping the benefits , through techniques I picked up that help me get and keep new work , ways I changed my thinking about what I do ( thank you , Matt Webb , especially ) and ongoing contact with some new North American friends and colleagues . <p> A WDN08 innovation I liked was Birds of a Feather . It was great to have peer-to-peer nattering built @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave it focus . There 's something in that . <p> And I got to meet Zeldman . Damn good value all round , then . <p> I hope I can get to Denver in Feb . Love the program . Ironically , the thing that makes it so extra-attractive - the way its spread over several days - might be the reason I cant get there , what with accommodation costs and taking time away from work . <p> Thanks for the promo code . If you attend before December 5th you get in addition the early bird discount . So $745 is in my opinion really a good price for the conference . I also took part in it last year and it was really wortwhile. 
@@99593555 @3793555/ <p> In the past year , I 've moved both home and office . Keeping the addresses straight was tough for a while , but I think Ive finally got a grasp on it . Occasionally though , I still get packages delivered to my home address . Naturally , I 'm not there during the day . <p> Most of the time I can simply pass along the office address to those sending the packages , but sometimes its not that easy . In those cases , after receiving the first delivery notice , I phone up UPS to redirect . ( I never seem to remember the automated customer-service line shortcut for most systems , press 0 , so I get stuck listening to their tediously comprehensive , non-skippable set of tips that cover everything from what to do if you missed the third delivery attempt to what action you can take if you accidentally ship your prize schooner-in-a-bottle to Mongolia . ) <p> When I get through to an actual person and request the redirect , the first thing theyll ask for is my forwarding address , complete @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . Given the moves , I now have two to remember and a few to try and forget ; they continually blend together , and I always end up telling the rep to hold on while I Google my own damn postal code . <p> An aside on postal/ZIP codes : does anyone else get the feeling that these have outlived their usefulness ? They exist for an extra level of precision when street naming is an inexact science at times , but is n't that a relatively easy problem that software should be solving these days ? It seems to me that the using a postal code in 2005 is akin to exposing a unique database I 'd to a user ; there should be better ways . <p> But that all brings me to the real problem how come UPS does n't  remember my forwarding address from the last time I redirected ? I asked last week whether this were possible , and received assurance that it was not . Its a pretty safe bet that every time I choose to redirect a package in the future , I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shouldnt have to give them the same address every single time ; software can do that for me . <p> I do n't  necessarily mind having to take action and inform UPS of the redirect , since I can see a lot of ways the system could potentially be confused or abused were the redirect automatic . But it should take a lot less effort on my part to make it happen . <p> Keep in mind that I 'm not the shipping party , and I did n't  choose the shipping company ; when I see obvious customer service holes in the response to what I 'd assume is a common action , the next time I am the one making the choice I may just dial up the other guys first . <p> Mark Ah , interesting point . I never use my postal code in my searches , since I never remember the stupid thing . I would guess that the ##### format is a bit easier to memorize than the L#L-#L# format were saddled with . <p> As a quick note ( unless its different outside the UK @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 for this thing , press 2 for that thing " menu , taking advantage of the fallback to put you straight through to an operator if you do n't  press anything , because not everyone can be guaranteed to have a touch-tone phone . That 's probably going to go away soon , but for now it works . <p> Jonathan : the " tell the government once about my new address " trick only works if you trust the government to keep the One Big Master Database With All Information About Jonathan Eckmier In It , which I , personally , dont. : - ) <p> The specific problem with UPS in this case is that in order to hold , you first have to listen to a minute or two of automated messages dealing with a number of different circumstances before you even get a menu to hold through . Its a bit excessive . <p> I 've simply had horrible luck with UPS in general . " Guaranteed second-day air " that in practice was fourth day ground tops it off . If I have a choice between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alternative in a heartbeat . <p> I used to work for the UPS Store , and yes we did have some trouble with on-time delivery and packages getting damaged . But I think the problem seems to be concentrated . UPS moves 16 million packages a day at last count and has a smaller error rate than FedEx who only moves 9 - 10 million packages a day . <p> Glad I was n't a driver . <p> As for customer service , yeah , they took forever to answer claims , and even though were branded like them we got treated like all of you - which customers never understood . UPS was always being the big bully , buying Mail Boxes Etc , turning it into the UPS Store , and then doing nothing special with the franchises . <p> Like a geek said : why not just do it online ? I get married in 2 days so I have some people sending gifts to our house , which of course , we are not at during the day . When I come home and see the UPS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and tell UPS To deliver it to my office address . <p> I always liked how in England - in books , at least - someones address can be the name of his house or manor . With modern databases today , that should be even easier to do . If you live in Willow Cottage , Smallburg , Virginia , why cant that be your mailing address ? <p> I have nothing but good things to say about the service we receive from UPS here in the UK . <p> For example , when I moved house across town a few years back , the local UPS guy managed to intercept a parcel addressed to me at my old address and bring it across town to my new place . He just recognised my name and knew the new address and so re-routed . That 's just one example - they 're great , consistently . <p> My personal favorite is FedEx . They are almost always cheaper ( for the basic service ) and usually seem faster . Today Ive been tracking a laptop delivery on a 5-7 day shipping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2 days . 2 day delivery on a 5-7 day service price from Shanghai , that is service . <p> We use FedEx at our office , and its not particularly spectacular ; lesser of two evils maybe <p> Have you read the UPS guidelines for preparing packaging ? <p> " Each item should be surrounded by at least two inches ( five cm ) of cushioning and be placed at least two inches ( five cm ) away from the walls of the box . This will protect your items from product-against-product damage and shield them from the shock and vibration that can be conducted from the exterior of the box to its contents in transit . " <p> Two inches is a LOT of bubble wrap , but then UPS should know better than anybody how to protect a shipment from damage , right ? What with all that testing in the field with your packages <p> I had someone ship a FedEx package to me , but he wrote down the house number wrong on the address . The package got delivered to a neighbor across the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ package on their porch . I called FedEx with the tracking number and told them that it was my package and not my neighbors package , that no one name " Dave Woodward " lives over there . They just said , " Its was delivered to the address on the label . " How hard could it be for them to do a simple check of previously shipped-to addresses under my name in my zipcode ? It still bothers me that they will deliver a package to a person who does n't  live at the address and not even care . After all , ultimately they 're delivering packages to people , not addresses . <p> I just had a very odd thing happen . Local UPS now has you fill out your info on a computer screen , and then confirm the addresses . I did this , confirming my box to Heath / Zenith , Bowling Green , KY . I was very carful here and did NOT confirm thier substitute address , which had the extended zip , because the address had recently changed . SO what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . My only saving grace was the tracking . I knew I did n't  send it to " nuts to you " , Irene Ave , Salisbury , MD . I 've never even heard of nuts to you ! The other odd thing was I checked my recept and it even said " nuts to you " , Irene Ave . Very strange . I called , they offered no explaination , or appology . They just said they would pick it back up and remail it . I asked if this was a common problem since switching to the computer system , vs the old fill the form out with a pen ! They said it happened every now and then ! Well let 's hope the person is home , so my package can continue on its way . 30455 @qwx890455 30451 @qwx890451 <p> You are reading " UPS Delivery " , an entry posted on 11 October , 2005 , to the Script collection .

" Bulletproofing " a web site means effectively blending liquid and fixed-width techniques , accounting for alternate browsing scenarios , and generally designing web sites in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you 've been reading SimpleBits for any length of time , but having all these techniques in book form makes for easier explanation when speaking with clients and other designers . <p> I cant agree more Dave . I find that I refer to that book , and his other one , almost weekly . I tell all the other developers at work about it and tell them it is " a must " reference . I do n't  know Dan ( wish I did ) , but I like his work and way of explaining it . <p> Oh , and not to leave out your book , which I purchased ASAP when it was out , is great as well . I helped get you on that " Customers Favorite " list . Keep up the good work . <p> There must be fifty " page markers " stuck in my copy of " Bulletproof " - I do n't  really need them , because when I look up something , I find an even better way of doing it because of Daves way of giving you choices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on my shelves , his is the one most often referred to first . I also have " The Zen of CSS design " and it is much more " down to earth useful " than the title would imply . I thought I was going to have to assume the Lotus position to do my a:links , but not so . Very easy to understand and to follow . Thanks . <p> I thought the bullet proof title was a good way of describing the books content . It really showed some great techniques and made a positive argument for extra markupnot excessive , but just the minimal amount without markup being too non-semantic . <p> I have been reading SimpleBits for a couple of years now , but somehow , it was n't until reading this post that I learned the meaning of " bulletproofing " in this context . With my newfound knowledge , this book will be a great recommendation for my colleagues in the future . <p> I absolutly agree with you Dave . I bought Dans book 2 mounth ago and it gives you the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easy way . I do like the composition of an article . At first the text afterwards the XHTML and finally the CSS . <p> Its funny , at this very moment I have Web Standards Solutions open and Bulletproof Web Design sitting on the table . Ive been trying to get my team to understand why Web Standards are so awesome , and it took showing them a stats table with 2 classes doing what a 3 level deep nested table used to do to get them to understand . <p> The thing about this book is that its so pick-upable . I bought it shortly after its launch , and yet its one of the select few books in my possession ( and the only reference book , I might add ) that have never made the trip from on the desk before me , up onto my bookshelf . I persuaded my boss at work to purchase the book , and it has n't  yet been shelved there either . <p> You will have noticed that Bulletproofs introductory paragraph reads : " before you close the book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> This a great book . The explanations are very lucid and pracical . I would recommend this book for anyone that already has some experience with CSS and XHTML . For the beginner , I think a book with some explanation of the properties and selectors . <p> I did have one problem with the indestructible box . Adding more paragraphs to this breaks it . This example I feel needed to go one step further to cover this situation , as I think many people would use the box in this way .

CSS-3 is being developed this very moment by engineers and programmers . Why are n't  a few designers involved in building a language meant for style ? I honestly do n't  know . Maybe none of us were ever asked . Maybe none of us ever volunteered . <p> Mike Pick started a wish list today with linked text boxes and alpha-channel runarounds , two features hed like to see carried over from the print world . Both are logical to the designer , and already work in existing software applications . Here , then , are a few more to add to the pool . <h> Element Awareness <p> Visual design is all about proportion . If I have to guess at arbitrary values for text blocks of varying lengths , I cant properly design how they relate to each other . I may want #elementTwo to be 500 pixels high because #elementOne is , but if the user @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for , my plans go out the window . <p> If I was able to apply height : inherit(#otherElement) ; to a specific element , the problem would be solved . <h> Better Vertical Alignment <p> The vertical-align property has been around since CSS level 1 , but its currently a poor concept in general use . You may only apply it to inline elements ( and later , table-cell elements ) we need block-level vertical alignment too , guys . Why cant we apply it to both ? <h> Type Improvements <p> Credit where credit is due : CSS handles type really well right now . line-height and letter-spacing attributes and first-line/first-letter selectors go a long way toward addressing what designers traditionally do with type . But since there 's always room for improvement , here are two things I wish to see addressed . Compare the following : <p> corkboard <p> Its possible you 're scratching your head and wondering the difference , but trust me , typography geeks will see it . You may only see one intended effect , but there are two problems ( assuming the size @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The first is that I have no idea which font the top word renders in . Theoretically , you should be seeing Helvetica . But if you do n't  have it installed , chances are you 're seeing Arial instead . The fact that I have to guess at this highlights a big problem . Typefaces are important , and to some designers , having to dish up Arial as a substitute for Helvetica is almost as reprehensible as serving Comic Sans as a substitute for Caslon . This problem is n't really the W3Cs to solve , but someone has to figure it out . <p> A proprietary solution exists in Microsofts WEFT , but when was the last time anyone actually used it ? Thanks to licensing issues involved in embedding fonts , the whole process of selecting a character subset from a font that 's actually safe to embed is almost onerous enough to invalidate the method . <p> The second problem with the above example is something the CSS working group can address . Notice the difference in spacing between the two words ? The top is loose and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ program before adjusting . The second is tightly-kerned and far more refined . In Photoshop , as with any high-end design program , I can adjust the space between each letter individually . Yes , this is important . <p> While kerning in the style sheet would quickly become a burdensome task for any longer passages and really , who kerns body text ? I should at least have the option of adjusting my display text ; that is , my headlines . A possible interface might look something like kerning(5) : -10 , +5 , -20 ; . The first value would apply to the space between characters five and six , with the subsequent values affecting those between six and seven , and seven and eight , respectively . Units could be percentages of an em , or for maximum obfuscation they could be full em values ( and the designer would just have to put up with three-digit decimal values ) . <p> What do you want to see out of CSS ? What kind of functions do you find in traditional design software that you wish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proportions in the comments , I 'll consider submitting some of these to www-style. 30451 @qwx890451 <p> You are reading " Designers Wishlist " , an entry made on 12 August , 2003 , filed under " CSS " .

@@99593560 @3793560/ <p> There should be a law . Well maybe not so much a law as a stipulation of employment . This law or stipulation should force designers to work with the systems , product , or sites that they build . <p> Ive been doing some adjusting on this site recently , and the more I start using it myself ( to refer back to old posts , to comment on fresh posts , and so forth ) the more I see ways where things could be done better . <p> The comment sections have seen the most change recently . I 've bumped up the font size in the comment boxes , and increased the height by a few lines . Why ? Beause they were too hard to use for longer comments . I added a numbering system to the individual comments . Why ? Because I was noticing it was too hard to scroll the list and keep track of where I was after so a few pages of comments . <p> ( And I should digress here there have been some excellent threads recently . I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still thrilled every time I get another reply . ) <p> My archives are pretty klunky right now . I spent some time a few months ago putting together the current calendar system , which is fine I suppose , but what I really need is a way to browse by subject . Dates are n't  nearly as important as what the post was about . This Ive discovered only by having to go back to find a reference , and actually being forced to use the system I 've built . <p> Ive been working on a few site managers and planning systems lately where interface and usability are crucial to the process . Unfortunately , the budget and time constraints are such that usability is planned in advance , but once the system is built there is no further refinement . This is a problem . The best possible usability feedback comes not from the designer looking at a database and figuring out how the tables and forms interact , but from the users who spend significant amounts of time interacting with the system and actually trying to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worked where i was given this huge bloated Photoshop " masterpiece " and told to create a webpage around it . oh , and here 's 4 paragraphs of text we need on there , too . <p> I think this happens a lot when you are dealing with someone ( either the client or someone else in the idea formulation chain ) who only has experience with print design . I still find myself falling prey to page-bloat when I get trapped in a print design mode . A sympathetic reeducation on what the web is about and how more accessible pages will benefit the customer would probably help . And if they convince even one other person in their network of associates , its worth the time . <p> There are two types : the fine-arts-schooled or self-taught that really have n't studied design in the first place , and the high-end experience designers that create things of beauty who should n't be designing things people are expected to use . <p> Furthermore , when design for the web is taught , it is usually as a simple addendum to print @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , from what I have seen and heard , still teach table soup as the main method of coding , with a continuing strong emphasis on Flash . At some point there is going to have to be a shift in the paradigm of the educators ( and not just the ones in schools ) if the transition to proper markup is going to float . Of course this site and others like it go a long way towards furthering that goal . The CSS Zen Garden has to be the single best way to convince a designer of the power of style sheets . How do we translate that into something convincing for a school administrator , when the old way certainly seems " good enough " ? <p> Justin , you 'll be happy to note that I 've seen a lot of educational interest in the Zen Garden . Its great when a whole pool of sequential class C addresses ( 200.50.50.10 - 200.50.50.25 for example ) hits it at roughly the same time . People are using it as an instructional tool . That 's great news , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> i just wonder if this is more prevalent , or just local to a few companies ? <p> More prevalent than you 'd like to think . A lot of people do a lot of things wrong . I 'm not blameless , I make mistakes too . Its easy to get wrapped up in your specialty and ignore those outside of it . That 's what I see as a huge problem amongst those that work on the web - everyone wears blinders that allow them to see in one direction at a time . <p> I 'm actually quite pleased they fade so much they are completely un-important except for references sake . I may make them a biiit darker , but the point is that they 're there if you need em , they fade into the background when you do n't  . <p> Just in case anyones wondering I actually had to get messy with a bit of ASP to generate them I hoped I might be able to get away with list items ( like Mark ) but it was n't to be . I might be convinced to post @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point , adding some search functionality might be necessary for those ( including yourself ( ! ) ) who are looking for a particular subject . <p> Being a browser myself ( as in one who browses , not a software application ) , I kind of like getting lost in a ton of information . Ill often find myself looking for one thing and discovering something else of interest and following it 10 links away from original starting point . <p> Funny , I was formulating a theory on the train this morning about how good developers with good usability instincts will always create a better experience than even the best " usability expert " could do , mainly because we " use " it . I 've mentally queued it for my forthcoming site <p> i du n no , i work with developers and seem to be constantly amazed by how " un-usabe " a feature is that theyve added or coded in. or how counter-intuitive it is , or how a link or item gets put in the strangest places where one needs to really hunt around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . then again , i know some gfx/designers that are just all about a graphic or flash animation , and honestly do n't  care about if it makes any sense in the scope of the project in question . <p> but its funny how often you write something ( blog , for example ) and find yourself complaining like an " end user " about yer own work lol <p> i know some gfx/designers that are just all about a graphic or flash animation , and honestly do n't  care about if it makes any sense in the scope of the project in question <p> I abhor that mindset . There are two types : the fine-arts-schooled or self-taught that really have n't studied design in the first place , and the high-end experience designers that create things of beauty who should n't be designing things people are expected to use . <p> Using the art comes first as an excuse against usability is almost always to compensate for lack of talent . <p> i 'd have to agree with ya , man . and i like art ! but ive worked where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and told to create a webpage around it . oh , and here 's 4 paragraphs of text we need on there , too . <p> *ugh* sorry , i realize this is heard quite often - but it is annoying . on the flipside , there 's developers/programmers that really have no sense of the overall purpose behind the web-application ( which i find myself stressing all the time ) . personally , i find myself in-between these two " camps " and it sucks . and of course the boss/management has no effin clue . <p> i just wonder if this is more prevalent , or just local to a few companies ? <p> Going back there are always things to make better . I have n't replied to your e-mail yet cause we launched our new home site over the weekend <p> I 'm still updating a few pages , but came to your site after realizing that a small chunk of CSS I 'd been using for positioning purposes became irrelevant after making some changes , and I needed a breather ! <p> So my two day old design already fell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mistake , more an oversite of redundant CSS that should have been cleaned up ( I guess that *is* a rookie mistake , no ? ; - ) <p> Its easy to get wrapped up in your specialty and ignore those outside of it . <p> amen to that ! i know i fall into that category quite a bit and to be honest , am still tryn to come to grips with the whole " designing with standards " thing ive been reading up on alot lately . but after being spoiled rotten with working on Intranets for 5 years in IE enviroments .. well , old habits die hard sometimes ; ) <p> btw , the comment count/listing is pretty spiffy thought they were images at first . lol <p> I have never met developers concerned with usability aspects . If they do create UIs , they are simply a reflection of the objects in the DB and the methods applicable to those objects . Those UIs contain no idea about how the system is going to be used . And when you ask those developers how to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They do know how the system works , but have no clue on using it . Do n't  even try asking questions about " usage scenarios " or stuff like that : - ) <p> Leonya , you are confusing developers with programmers . What you describe is the expected result of a programmer . A programmer sees everything ( including the UI ) as the end result of the program . The developer sees the program as the end result of everything else . Neither is better or worse in general , and you 're best off if you have both on your project . <p> Also to clarify my initial point , I was talking about " good developers with good usability instincts " , which I do n't  think is the norm ( yet ) . Of course , my viewpoint could be tainted by the fact that in my years of dealing with " usability experts " and reading the work of those I have n't worked with , I honestly cant recall anything valuable ever being said that would n't be common sense to the aformentioned developer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where stupid and/or wrong things were said . <p> " Do n't  worry , most users do n't  know how to change the font size anyways " <p> I realize these are accessibility issues as well as usability ( if for some reason you feel the need to draw a strong distinction ) , but the list goes on and on . <p> In short , Usability Engineering is simply the application of the " experts " personal biases and those biases theyve read from other " experts " .

@@99593562 @3793562/ <p> This is an article I needed to find myself six months ago . Feel free to link gratuitously with phrases like " html translation " and " unicode web " and " foreign language web site " and any other appropriate search term you can think of so that others may benefit from it . <p> I 've recently had to get my hands dirty with HTML in French , Greek characters , and English OS support for Asian languages , so I figured I 'd pass on the results of my muddling creating the various translations of the Zen Garden . This is a short but sweet summary of what I know on the subject . <h> Do n't  Panic <p> First of all : How in the world do you even start with foreign character support , especially if you do n't  speak the language ? If you receive a foreign-language document and get asked to put it on the web , this is about the point you start panicking . <p> Relax , its actually surprisingly easy , given a fairly modern Operating System with decent language @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Operating System Support <p> You may not be able to see the document in its original character set , but depending on your OS , you might be able to copy and paste the characters between documents without damaging the data . I 've had luck copying from Windows Notepad and pasting into my HTML editor . <p> Easiest way to tell is to try with a small amount of data paste it into a properly-encoded document ( see below ) , and view it in Mozilla or IE6 . If it renders properly with the desired characters intact , you 're good to go . <p> If it does n't  , you may not have the correct language pack installed it should be possible to work with the data anyway ( even if you ca n't view it just make sure you test on a system that can ) , but it cant hurt to install any foreign language packs you can get your hands on , just in case . The 200MB of disk space is negligible in 2003 . <h> File Formats <p> UTF-16 files are out . Do not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a double-byte Unicode file . Most modern browsers support it , but some older ones do not ( IE5/Mac comes to mind ) . Not only that , but your file size doubles , and IIS and PHP alike have trouble with the files so unless you 're serving up static HTML ( not likely in 2003 ) you wont be able to use them anyway . <p> Feel free to save a properly-encoded or UTF-8 document as anything you wish though . It can be . html , . php , . asp and so on . <h> Document Encoding <p> Its all about character encoding , baby . Redundancy is the key ; define your XML namespace if working with XHTML , and also ( regardless if you 're using HTML 4.01 or XHTML 1. x ) add a &lt;meta&gt; tag to specify your documents encoding. <h> &lt;meta&gt; Tag Encoding : <p> On top of setting your XML language , 9.8 times out of 10 you 'll also want to specify document encoding . I 'm a little unclear on the difference between the two , but WaSP has a summary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looks like this : <p> The charset ( character set ) is the key . For most western European languages based on Latin characters , you wont need to change this ; just include it . For eastern European , Asian , and all other languages , there are different charsets lists are available but the best resource for this is in your Mozilla-based browser ; hit View-&gt;Character Coding , and you should find a comprehensive list of all possibilites with their associated charset value . Use the code in brackets ( UTF-8 , US-ASCII etc. ) and not the full name . <p> Note that the WaSP article linked above has further information on server-side character encoding . This is beyond my current abilities , but is something highly recommended by the W3C . Worth a read , if you want to really do it properly . <p> Unicode character encoding works just fine , and in some cases is preferable . The difference here is that were not saving the document as a double-byte Unicode file ; were instead merely setting the documents charset to Unicode through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " content-type " content= " text/html ; charset=utf-8 " /&gt; <p> As far as individual characters , you may want to try using HTML Character Entities for occurances of non-ASCII characters . That is , you might want to use &amp;Uuml ; instead of just the character itself , . This can be tedious and trying though , and given proper encoding as discussed above , may even be unnecessary . <h> Accessibility Concerns <p> One last thing to consider before we wrap up . WAI lists " identifying changes in language " as a priority 1 accessibility concern , which is to say , its Really Important that you do this . If your HTML switches at any point from the main language to another , you must provide some cue for the browser that this is happening . See the WAI for more on this . <h> Conclusions <p> This document was written by an embarrassingly unilingual English speaker with extremely limited foreign language capability beyond grade-school French classes . If I 've managed to wrangle over a dozen translations of a document using these techniques , chances are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made some errors and over-simplified , but hey that 's what the comments are for . <p> Great article . I often get asked to put foreign language information up at the hospital and until now figured PDF was the only realistic option . Itll be interesting to see how it pans out , but I plan on seeing if I cant do some of this myself . <p> As I understand it , if you 're writing XHTML you cant assume the character entities will be defined unless you specify a DTD : the simple presence of the namespace is n't enough . The safest bet if you do n't  want to use " binary " characters ( Unicode or charset-specific ) is to use the generic XML representation : &amp;mdash ; = &amp;#8212 ; , etc . <p> Also regarding double-byte encoding , file sizes , etc. , I 've found two of Tim Brays articles on Unicode ( On the Goodness of Unicode and Characters vs . Bytes ) to be real lifesavers . <p> I 'm running translations both with HTML character entities ( Norwegian ) and without ( Portuguese ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> So from my understanding of what you 're saying , I should just use the characters as-is ( Portugese ) or go one step further and use XML representation instead of HTML character entities ( Norwegian ) , just in case it so happens the user agent does n't  use the standard HTML character entities correct ? <p> One difficulty you may encounter if you find yourself actually working with large numbers of files saved as UTF-8 is finding an editing environment that is any better than notepad which preserves the encoding . Here at work ( advoy.com ) the front end team has been dragged kicking and screaming into using ultraedit , simply because it preserves the encoding type , does n't  munch the characters , and does n't  stick a couple bytes of garbage at the beginning of the file to remember how it is encoded . It auto-detects when you check the right Advanced -&gt; Configuration .. <p> Has anyone else found an editor that deals with UTF-8 files ? Homesite , along with every other editor except notepad and ultraedit that we have tried are unable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adding their own flags to the beginning of the file . Any thoughts ? ( btw our team has been in touch with Macromedia regarding Homesite , they acknowledged the problem and then it went nowhere ) . <p> At the Garden you 're fine using character entities because you 've got the doctype . Mozilla will handle the entities unless you omit the doctype and serve your pages as application/xhtml+xml , at which point the strict XML parser kicks in and you get " XML Parsing Error : undefined entity " for the HTML entities ; I cant speak to the behaviour of other browsers that support a/x+x ( are there any ? ) . <p> I believe ( though I cant find the reference ) that if the encoding of an XML document is unspecified in the XML declaration or if the XML declaration is missing altogether it is assumed to be UTF-8 . <p> Not exactly sure what you 're getting at here . At one point , you write " Unicode files are out Most modern browsers support it , but some older ones do not ( IE5/Mac comes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ character encoding works just fine , and in some cases is preferable . " <p> At any rate , I recommend UTF-8 for all non-Roman situations . IE5/Mac has no trouble with pages containing UTF-8-encoded Japanese . <p> You write " on top of setting your XML language , 9.8 times out of 10 you 'll also want to specify document encoding . I 'm a little unclear on the difference between the two " . The XML language is the human language the document is written in . You know , like English . The encoding is the charset , like ISO-8859-1 ( Latin-1 ) . Japanese , for example , has 3 different possible Japanese-only encodings ( shift-jis , iso-2022-jp , and EUC-JP ) , plus Unicode ( similar situation for Chinese ) , so putting the correct coding in there can be the difference between the browser showing the page correctly and showing a page full of junk that requires a trip to the Encoding menu . <p> I 'd say Vietnamese is another good example of the difference between encoding and human language . Vietnamese can be encoded in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ VNCII/VPS , and Windows-1258 . None of these encodings are at all compatible with one another , except for VIQR , which is basically the lowest common denominator , being an ASCII representation of Vietnamese . <p> Adam - Unicode is a character encoding method . Unicode files , as I 've poorly defined in the article , refer to double-byte files . That is , each character occupies 16 bits of space , versus the 8 that a regular plain-text file would normally require . Those are unusable . <p> Unicode document encoding is a completely different beast , however . Only by a simple tag , I can mark the file as UTF-8 and thus use any foreign characters I require . I am unfamiliar with the way the character data is stored though . Unicode is something I have n't dabbled with extensively , so if I am totally wrong here , I expect someone else can correct me . <p> With regards to your second point - that 's about how I understood it , I just did n't  want to take the leap into the deep end . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because in a lot of cases the character encoding is essential , in some its not . If you fool around with western languages , you 'll generally find the encoding does n't  make a difference . <p> The whole Unicode part appears to be a bit confusing . Unicode is not a character encoding method , utf-8 and utf-16 are . The utf-16 encoding is what you wrongly refer to as Unicode files . <p> Just tagging the file as utf-8 does not magically makes the encoding utf-8 . Doing that probably worked for you because : 1 ) the data you were copying from notepad already was encoded as utf-8 , or 2 ) your html editor recognized the meta tag and made sure it encoded any characters your entered as utf-8 . <p> If your site is running on Apache , and you are allowed to change server settings using . htaccess files , you can set the Content-Type HTTP header for all files with a . html extension in a directory by creating a . htaccess file with the following line : <p> AddCharset utf-8 . html @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Mozilla live http headers extension . <p> If you want to use utf-8 encoded php files , you need the following in your . htacces file : <p> Thanks Thijs , that clears up a few things , but here 's why I 'm still confused on the file format issue : <p> This file was saved straight from Notepad as " UTF-8 " ( its in the drop-down list ) and uploaded . All the SSIs work , so it renders properly . ( although ignore the character encoding , since its buried in an include file ) <p> This is the exact same file , saved as " Unicode " from the drop-down . IIS does n't  like it . <p> So I 'd imagine the latter is actually UTF-16 ? What I was trying to get at was that in my experience there 's a way to save a Unicode file that breaks IIS ; UTF-16 looks to be that , if I 'm now understanding better , but most editors do n't  make that differentiation - you kinda have to know ahead of time what the difference is . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ above 127 . It indeed is encoded as UTF-8 , but it is at the same time encoded as USASCII and at the same time also ISO-8859-1 . All these encodings share the same first 127 characters at the same positions , so if you only use the first 127 characters in a file , there is no difference . <p> IIS probably assumes that you 'll be using character encodings where one byte = one character . UTF-16 uses two bytes for each character ( well , four bytes for some of the less-used parts of Unicode ) .. so for normal everyday ASCII text a UTF-16 file will have alternating bytes containing 0x00 and the ASCII characters the ASCII null characters ( 0x00 ) will confuse IIS , PHP , Perl , etc . So do n't  use UTF-16 for any file which is going to be interpreted by your web server ( PHP , server-side includes , etc . ) <p> UTF-8 is a variable-length encoding with some useful properties . it stores ASCII text unchanged .. an ASCII text file ( which would include no characters with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As soon as you have any non-ASCII characters ( such as accents over letters , or any non-Roman scripts , or any non-ASCII symbols such as curly quotes or em dashes , etc. ) then the UTF-8 encoding is not going to match any other encodings . But all your server-side include directives , PHP commands , etc. are plain ASCII so theyll be unchanged and therefore everything should work . <p> UTF-8 is a very cool encoding. ( at least if you 're writing in English .. it causes file sizes to be larger than otherwise necessary for Asian languages ) 30455 @qwx890455 30451 @qwx890451 <p> You are reading " HTML and Foreign Languages " , an entry posted on 29 July , 2003 , to the Caught collection .

@@99593563 @3793563/ <p> I feel like I 'd better pop my head up and break the Web Directions-induced radio silence for the sake of getting at least one more post on here before the end of the year . So this will be a bit of a round-up of what 's been on my radar in the past month , in amongst all the craziness . <h> Web Directions North <p> The most frequent question in casual conversation these days : how are registrations ? This year its going really well . I daresay WDN08 is going to quite a bit bigger than 2007 . There 's still a lot an awful lot to do before the end of January , but the four of us putting it on are starting to feel the pressure lifting a little which is a nice pre-holiday treat . If you missed it , Digital Web is running their snowboard contest once again , and you have a few more days to get entries in for a shot at free tickets to the conference . <h> 24 Ways <p> Drew and crew are back for another year of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weekend my annual contribution was published : Get in Shape , where I spend some time looking at the role of consistency , balance , and completion in design . Given last years colour analysis , you could be forgiven for plotting the next few years worth according to fundamental design elements like , ohhhh , say line or texture . <h> Suits <p> Youve likely heard by now that Opera has decided to engage in legal proceedings against Microsoft . The main points seem to resolve to 1 ) Microsoft is limiting choice , and 2 ) they 're refusing to implement web standards . <p> Ill reserve judgment on point #2 until I see what 's in store for IE8 as the steps forward made by IE7 give me some hope for what lies ahead . ( It struck me IE7 was a quick fix to kill the biggest headaches , so I wonder what theyve done with the year or so they 've had since shipping . ) <p> As for point #1 , have n't we seen this movie ? Keep in mind that Opera is a commercial company . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Windows is somewhat telling . <p> Eric Meyer thinks this is a case of very Bad Timing and though I 'm not quite as concerned about potential bad reactions , I find myself agreeing . <p> Reactions have been swift and passionate both on-site and elsewhere . For my part , I questioned the financing of such a proposal , but that 's far from my only concern . I think Maciej Stachowiak ( Apple , WebKit ) sums it up best : those of us in the trenches do n't  get feature requests from the general web design &amp; development community , but the browser folks do . Far be it for me to claim what I want is the same as what everyone else wants ; the community is too diverse . Removing the people who likely have the most insight and do much of the work seems like a less than ideal course of action . <h> Zen Mini-update <p> Back in October I decided to change the submissions process of the css Zen Garden to either yes , you 're in , or no , thanks for trying . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd forgotten that I often dont/cant include great work for some reason or another . Rejecting them outright was a problem . <p> So , another quick change to the publishing process , and were back to the old way . All designs are published , but the ones that do n't  make the cut are put on the Other Designs list ( accessible from " All Designs " in the top paragraph of text ) . While I was at it I decided to use the metadata for the newer ones that have it , so there 's now a country and date listed for each of these . <p> A big link list may not be as elegant as the previous categorized designs , but its sustainable I still make a yes or no decision , but at least these the ones that do n't  make it have a place to go . <h> Presents . Did I mention there were presents ? <p> And to end on a positive tone , I 'd like to share a few sites I 've been enjoying lately . <p> I Love Typography popped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blog . It was an automatic add , but its managed to keep me engaged with great material like font creation case studies . Then little while later I noticed Nice Web Type , which has n't  been updated much yet , but hits all the right buttons in terms of subject matter . One to watch anyway . <p> Two personal blogs that stood out this year are Ongoing and rc3 . Both are written by programmers , both frequently dive into coding minutae I cant hope to follow , but both also cover much broader subject matter more frequently in literate and well-considered fashion . <p> And a brand new find ( as a result of a link to Web Directions , if I remember correctly ) is FAIRspot . Part blog , part gallery , part directory , its kind of like CSS Beauty without the CSS part . Lots of great stuff coming through their RSS feed . <p> That 's likely it from me in 2007 . Its been a fairly light year for writing on this site , but that 's just cause Ive been busyelsewhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a complaint with the European Commission , is not a lawsuit , and the timing is in step with similar complaints that has been successfully tested . Thus , both the timing and the actual complaint are near perfect . Sadly , it seems to have resulted in a lot of uninformed noise , which hopefully will die down shortly . <p> The process behind CSS and other standards - and especially the implementation part , will probably gain from being discussed in many fora - as long as nobody seriously suggest that same standards should , or can , be produced without full participation of those who are supposed to implement them .

Can you provide a link to Bobs original page ? By the way , who 's Bob ? <p> Nope , that 's not how it works . Its using overflow : hidden ; which only triggers when the content is larger than its bounding box . Since the boxes stretch to fit content by default , you need to contrain them - width and height are essential for this . <p> Note that Bobs original page on this compared display : none ; to visibility : hidden ; and found equally unsatisfactory results for each . Also note that visibility : hidden ; and overflow : hidden ; are two different things . <p> Also note that overflow : hidden ; *hasnt* , to the best of my knowledge , been tested amongst the major screenreaders ; its assumed to work .

But since they are sreen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the readers part . <p> Jimmy : I 'm no expert on screen readers , but from what I 've read I think of them as literally *screen* readers general-purpose interfaces for Windows and MSIE ( although it appears they can suss out a bit of HTML structure ) . <p> If anyone complained that they could not reach some content , there was a simple way around it ( that I employed ) .

@@99593566 @3793566/ <p> Note : If you 're looking for the comment Tantek has made about the CSS validator , due to archiving changes on this site you may now find it here . <p> If you have n't been to the Zen Garden in a while , go ! The current front page set of designs ( Hedges through to Not So Minimal ) is absolutely amazing , and way exceeds my vision of what this would become . Everyone who has submitted so far ought to be proud ; this is a quite a thing we 've got here . <p> As well , the translations list is growing . Twelve languages are complete , and I have four more in the works . I 've learned a lot working with foreign character sets , and I 'll write about my findings in the future . For the time being , take a look at Jukka Korpellas thoughts on multilingual authoring for the web , written after his experience translating the Garden to Finnish ( coming soon ! ) <p> Its getting a bit harder to keep up with the volume of submissions . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to Zen Garden standards , and I 've tried to give as helpful and constructive criticism as possible to the work that does n't  make the cut . I have at least 10 submissions on hand right now , some will make it , most wo n't . Thats 10 people I have to spend 5 to 10 minutes writing back ; it adds up . <p> How am I doing so far ? Consider this a chance to voice your opinion about the way I 'm running the Garden . I 've made many small changes along the way thanks to feedback , and I 'm open to more . Just remember I can tweak non-display code like titles and accesskeys , but there are far too many designs to modify structure . <p> For anyone looking for a slightly less ambitious challenge than the Zen Garden , Nic Steenhout has written me about a contest he s running . The Internet Bonsai Club is looking for a CSS makeover. 500 people a day visit his site , so it could be some rather respectable exposure . Take a look . <p> Holy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Some days I start to wonder if Mark Pilgrim is on to something when he closes comments on older threads . 30454 @qwx890454 <p> The media attribute specifies screen . This , of course , makes perfect sense as the designs are rich and visual in nature . They 're not meant for aural , print , small screen , etc <p> However , some of the submissions use the voice-family hack to deal with the IE 5 box model problem . While I definitely see the reasoning and value in using the hack ( heck , I used it myself ! ) , it ultimately results in validation error : <p> Property voice-family does n't  exist for media screen : " " " " <p> If I 'm not mistaken ( and if I am please feel free to correct me ) but part of the reason that the Garden exists is to show the value of standards-based design . The Garden page also uses a strict XHTML doctype so the assumption can be made that adhering to standards is paramount to making the case for standards-based design . <p> My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ statement in the head section if IE 5 must be supported . Yes it is an ugly hack ( arguably not more so than adding extra div tags for purely presentational reasons ) , *but* its completely valid . Its not *valid* in the sense that its tricking the validator either , but actually valid in that its really just a comment in the mark-up to every browser but IE 5+ . <p> Oh , for Petes sake . I just changed the media type last week from " all " , and had n't  realized it broke the box model hack . <p> Guess why I changed it ? That 's right : accessibility concerns . Specifying media= " all " has issues with Fahrner Image Replacement in screen readers , since theyll pick up the display : none ; . I figured an easy way out was changing the media type , and as an added bonus it got me thinking about opening the floodgates for print media style sheet submissions too . <p> Alright onload javascript dropped , and media type deleted . So that opens me up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this case I 'm going to have to choose valid CSS over a small accessibility concern which is n't entirely relevant anyway . <p> The Zen Garden is well linked in a lot of german weblogs , as far as I read them . It was mentioned a lot of times in the css-d-mailing list ( that 's where I heard of it the first time ) which is pretty multinational . It is suggested as reference in the IWA/HWG CSS Intermediate online course . So I think that a far amount of potential submitters even outside US/UK/Canada should be aware of this project . <p> Dave - I understand your point of view . Besides , its absolutely not your fault that there is a lack of international submissions . And , of course , I understand that you 're not going to refuse outstanding submissions that fall within a certain geographic region that is already well represented . <p> Anyway , to make my point I decided it was time I roll up my sleeves and get to work to produce a submission . That way maybe Holland might get a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> I am not " intimate " with the spec so please correct me if I am mistaken : If you do n't  include a media type is that not the same as specifying a media type of ALL ? Sure the CSS and XHTML will validate , but devices like webTV/small screen etc would be correct in trying to render the site using the CSS provided when really they should not ( WebTV renders it regardless , but that is besides the point ) . <p> Again , I completely understand your reasoning , however it just strikes me as being incorrect ( albeit pragmatic ) . <p> Just one request : is there any chance you could lose the status bar effect ? Its annoying in browsers that support multiple tabs as it tends to stick around on other pages , but more importantly it makes it impossible to see which images are being loaded while watching the page render , which helps the visitor understand how the design is structured ( particularly when on a slow connection ) . <p> There 's really no elegant solution for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " breaks the validator when we use Tanteks hack , or all devices get the same CSS and it validates . <p> I 'd prefer to use screen , but not at the expense of validation . If someone can come up with an elegant solution that does n't  involve stripping out all Tantek hacks and placing them in a separate CSS file , I 'm all ears . Not only would accessibility concerns be solved , I 'd be able to also add media= " print " and open that up for submissions too . <p> Perhaps in a years time the act of simply hiding CSS from IE 5 can be assessed ( using the high pass filter or whatever ) , just as CSS is currently hidden from Netscape 4 . IE 5 currently has around 30-40% marketshare ? ? How low must it go before you would feel comfortable hiding CSS from it and its broken box model ? <p> How low ? Consider some still code for NN4.xs 1.5% or lower market share Me personally , on the Zen Garden ? I 'd say 10% or lower would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but you can guarantee I 'd get a lot of e-mail about that if it ever happened . <p> The Garden is seen in a lot of different lights ; some think it goes too far and is n't practical on todays web , while others think it does n't  go far enough and is overloaded with unsemantic junk . The majority gets it , but the splinter groups on either side seem to be the most vocal . <p> Still , its about practical CSS that can be used today ( for the most part I broke a few rules with mnemonic , and have bent them once or twice for other designs ) and supporting IE5 is well within that definition . <p> I noticed you have an impressive list of translations available of the CSS Zen Garden . However , there 's not much of an international representation in the list of official designs . Its mostly anglosaxon designers that dominate the list ( errr , and Germany ) . I think its time the international webdesign community outside the US , UK and Canada wake up and submit their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to limit submissions to countries that are not yet represented . Of course this would mean ( positive ) discrimination , but heck , it would limit the number of submissions . <p> You could have an " International Submission Month " , a month where the only submissions that will be accepted or those of designers from countries not yet listed . Sure , quality matters . It still has to be good ! After that month , submissions can resume to normal . Ah well , just a suggestion . <p> Good points Simon - I 've had others complain about that too . It may yet go . <p> Didier - If designers outside English-speaking countries need to be better represented , its up to them to submit . Maybe the Garden needs to be better-promoted on non-English webogs ; I cant do this on my own , not the least reason of which is that I pretty much speak English only . <p> I 'm not playing the political game , so if you see a deficiency , its only because I have n't received anything . Your ideas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good work just because it does n't  match my geographical criteria ; ) <p> The problem Im finding is that as soon as I put any position ( relative or absolute ) on the extra divs , they imediately assume relativity to the top and left of the entire page body ( as they should , based on what they ARE relative to ) . So the furthest down on the page I can get them is where bottom of the initial screen loads ( and after that they stick there and do n't  move with the scrolling ) . <p> If you know a way around this , let me know . My suggestion of a few extra divs within the #container would be a viable workaround , but if there 's a way to do it without that change , I want to know what it is ( so I can use it ! ) . <p> ( Its very possible that I just am overlooking something . Any suggestions from anybody ? ) <p> The Garden is fantastic , a real eye opener for people who think that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do have one little grammatical weed to point out . The first sentence is either in the past tense , which seems a bit odd , or you have mispelled " lie " . In other words , the sentence should be : <p> Jai maybe its your floats . If large parts of your design are floated , its possible the extra divs are starting from a different spot than the bottom of the document . Since position : relative ; completely relies on where the element starts from , this is relevant . <p> Try this : #extraDiv1 position : relative ; top : -20px ; left : 20px ; <p> If its showing up anywhere but the bottom of the page ( possibly overlapping elements on the bottom ) then somethings wrong . <p> The first sentence is either in the past tense , which seems a bit odd , or you have mispelled " lie " . <p> Possible . I cant remember what process made me pick " lay " over " lie " , but I seem to remember struggling with this one . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take a closer look at this when I have some time . It looks promising , but I 'd a ) have to throw IE6 into Quirks mode ( which would involve heavy retro-fitting ) " <p> Would it really ? Wouldnt it simply require adding an xml prolog to the beginning of the document ( above the doctype ) to throw IE 6 into quirks mode while leaving Mozilla , Opera , Safari in standards mode <p> " I 'd have to write a special section on using it instead of the Tantek hack . " <p> Let 's not forget that we end up in the same place anyways : validation error . Using CSS 3 is not valid as its not a final recommendation yet . Even if it were : Using the vendor-specific -moz- wo n't validate either . I think it just makes the situation worse quite frankly . As you stated before : as long as IE 5 must be supported there really is no " elegant " solution . <p> Yes it would . Notice how adding -border-box-sizing forces Mozilla into using IE5s broken box model , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Garden , and that the designs take for granted the proper W3C box model . If we go and swap box models on them , they will break . <p> Let 's not forget that we end up in the same place anyways : validation error . <p> This is the more relevant of the points ; I have n't tried out the technique in any capacity yet , so I was taking Brownstones word for it that it does n't  get flagged as an error . I was n't even aware box-sizing was a CSS-3 property , actually ; -moz-box-sizing obviously is n't . <p> The goal : a validating box model hack that allows me to use media= " screen " without having to add a secondary style sheet specifically for the hacks . Will this do it ? I do n't  know . I 'll investigate when I have time . <p> But you would n't have to sit down and think out new values , because they already exist as part of the hack those " broken " box-model values are already in place . You just have to remove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're home free . But then , I would say that , since I 'm not the one who has to do it . ; o ) <p> I was n't even aware box-sizing was a CSS-3 property , actually ; -moz-box-sizing obviously is n't . <p> Only Opera supports box-sizing as far as I know , and yes ; the -moz equivalent is proprietary to Mozilla of course . Even so , the validator did n't  even raise an eyebrow when I tested it . <p> " You just have to remove the W3C box-model values and the voice- hack specifics and you 're home free . " <p> Personally , I do n't  like the idea that authors would be restricted from using the correct box model for the sake of IE 5 . I think if you travel down that road it has the potential to severely undermine the Gardens credibility . <p> They do not have to be restricted ; you can leave all the current styles as-is , and just draw attention to the above solution for those who would create a Garden design in the future . All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prolog to the top of the HTML file , and Tantek/Non-Tantek hacked style-sheets could live happily on the same server . <p> Where designers would be restricted is if the box-sizing hack were added in-line to the HTML file , before the @import statement to load the chosen style . <p> Mr. Brownstone : " They do not have to be restricted ; you can leave all the current styles as-is , and just draw attention to the above solution for those who would create a Garden design in the future . " <p> But if you add the XML prolog it throws IE into quirks mode and because it lacks the same parsing bug as IE 5 the voice family hack has no effect . Therefore existing submissions that use the W3C box model would break . <p> Hey Dave , would it break anybodys existing CSS submissions if you threw in a few extra blank divs within the #container div ? I just think that could be helpful for people who want to position things on the bottom of the page ( like bottom corners ) . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the page ; I do n't  think another set within a specific DIV will help very much . And if I do that , I should put them in the header as well , so its balanced , right ? ; ) <p> The 6 extra DIVs are for hacks , basically creative use of CSS should mean they 're not needed , and most designs do n't  use them , but they 're around just in case . I 've made use of them on occasion , so they are definitely valuable ; just against the spirit of what CSS should do . <p> I would like to suggest an alternative for Tanteks IE hack , which I use myself and does not seem to be caught by the validator . ( Even though most of my personal CSS files are riddled with other kinds of errors , this does n't  seem to be one of them ; - ) : html * box-sizing : border-box ; -moz-box-sizing : border-box ; All this does is force Mozilla , Opera , and any other CSS3 savvy browser that understands box-sizing to work with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ IEs model makes much more sense to most people , its quite a convenient hack . You need only specify one value for width , height , and so on , and these values in turn are easier to figure out . <p> The inspiration for this hack came from Peter-Paul Kochs box-model tweaking and * selector pages . Indeed , it is simply a rip-off of both to get the result I wanted . <p> I understand eth value of having the extra divs under everything- so they can be absolutely positioned from the top:0 and left:0 , but on designs that scroll down ( which is most of them ) , nothing can be attached to the bottom ( unless there is a property I am unaware of- I know Mozilla can relatively position divs with a " bottom : " command , but IE seems to ignore that ) . If there was one or 2 extra divs in the #container , that would allow relative div alignment to the bottom of that container . <p> I agree , in the " Real world " of designing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but for the purposes of a very customizable CSS demonstration , I think that they do make sense . <p> I 'll take a closer look at this when I have some time . It looks promising , but I 'd a ) have to throw IE6 into Quirks mode ( which would involve heavy retro-fitting ) and b ) I 'd have to write a special section on using it instead of the Tantek hack . It will most likely be too much trouble , but you never know . <p> Jai think about it a bit more ; those DIVs are already at the bottom of the document . Using relative , not absolute positioning , or even just using them in place without modifying the positioning , you should be able to accomplish whatever you need to down there . They 're outside of #container , granted , but that should n't be much of a problem with some creative CSS . <p> I have no clue about any actual implementations out there , but in theory , a " screen reader " should ignore the stylesheet altogether considering that a " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ browser that understands aural style sheets " . TV devices , handhelds , etc should in theory also ignore the stylesheet as its marked specifically for either screen or aural capable devices . <p> If this is so , then surely its a better bet than specifying a media type of " all " ( which " screen readers " do pick up ) . <p> The hack should validate and the voice family is essentially meaningless as used in the hack so it shouldnt cause an aural browser too much difficulty . <p> Interesting thinking , but two flaws I can see off-hand ( feel free to correct me if they do n't  apply ) the biggest is that aural IS , in fact , intended for screen readers . The official word on the CSS2 spec is that aural is for speech synthesizers , which is more or less exactly what a screen reader is . JAWS audibly dictates the screen to you . <p> The second and more obscure is that your method might actually knock out IE6 as well . Seemingly , it does n't  pick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Zen Garden issue of dealing with already-made designs , could n't the Tantek hack be implimented with a property other than voice-family ? As long as the property can be assigned a string , and is allowed in screen-media style sheets , it would work without causing validation issues . <p> Tanteks " Mid Pass Filter " could be a possible solution to the problem touched upon in this thread . Unfortunately , it would require reworking existing Garden Designs in order to validate , but it would allow CSS Zen Garden to use the proper media type : " screen " and at the same time allow authors to feed IE5/5.5Win unique style rules to deal with its incorrect box model .

Regardless , its interesting to see an article on web typography in the Style section of a major publication like IHT . <p> I 'm redesigning my blog with Georgia . I think , and this is just one persons opinion , that what it comes down to is people getting sick of Arial or sans-serif fonts . The web took the world by storm and everyone forgot some basic principles of typography and design when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make your fonts 9px Arial #CCC . But designers who have only worked on web designs know no different . <p> What I like about serif fonts is that they look better for bigger text on the screen . On my website I leave the standard browser/user-defined font size intact ; I use a serif font and it looks nice . <p> By the way , maybe nobody noticed , but , despite not being part of Microsofts core fonts for the web , another good serif font you can use and which is consistent both on Mac and Windows ( since XP ) is Palatino , " Palatino Linotype " on Windows . And I like that font . <p> Bruno : I 'm with you on that . I do n't  think of it so much as an alternative to Verdana , but as an alternative to Times . Its also the only web-safe font that includes dropped numerals , which make it kind of swanky for dates and other number-y content . <p> Ive been using Georgia for titles on my blog for a year and a half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) <p> The combination of a big , chunky Georgia for headers and smaller Verdana for the content is a nice trend . As Mike said , it looks a little better if the character-spacing is reined in . Ajaxian.com does a nice job styling their posts like this . <p> Does not all depend on what default fonts are available , which fonts are commonly known ( how many people except graphic designers know anything substantial about fonts ) , Georgia looks like a printing typeface . I found this article which could she 'd a light on some changes about what fonts might be a succes in the near future . <p> Pontos people with dyslexia have trouble reading any font , interesting article though glad to see this is making some press but am with Artur , Tahoma is way better than Verdana , but like the article from the Herald reads this is just a fad and everyone using it will move on to something else real soon . 30455 @qwx890455 30451 @qwx890451 <p> You are reading " Georgia Revival " , an entry posted on 13 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ See other posts in this collection . 
@@99593568 @3793568/ <p> A few typographic terms before we get started . Kerning is the process of optically adjusting the spacing between letters , by hand in most cases , to produce a more even end result . Hinting is the adjustment of type outlines , a willful distortion of the letterforms to help them fit the pixel grid . The difference is that you will most likely never need to hint ( its done by the designer/foundry before font distribution ) but kerning is an essential monkeywrench for your toolbox . And finally , anti-aliasing is the softening of jagged pixellated curves through interpolation . <p> The two lines of text pictured above show the difference between type set simply by entering and forgetting about it ( top ) , and type that has been manually kerned ( bottom ) . As digital type has matured , the defaults are getting rather good . Hinting of the more common professional typefaces is generally done well , but manual work by the designer is often still needed to take it the extra mile . <p> However , when you hit a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apply traditional kerning reliably . 12 pixel high type rarely benefits , unless the gaps are too obvious to ignore . <p> This is because when working with small enough sizes , a whole new set of problems is introduced . The algorithms used to generate type hit the pixel barrier : no stroke or curve can be reduced smaller than a single pixel in width . Anti-aliasing offers a method around this , by half-toning two or three pixels instead of setting one to full intensity . The optical effect is a smoother curve , which will often appear thinner . <p> But anti-aliasing is problematic , as the extra pixels add blur . And since its an all-or-nothing proposition , you will find them blurring in spots that you really would rather they did n't  . <p> In the above image , you 'll notice the stems ( vertical strokes on either side ) of the U are two grey pixels thick , instead of a single black pixel . The type display algorithm has essentially decided the center line for each stroke falls between the two pixels , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but easy for us to see that this results in a blurry U. Fortunately the tools exist that allow us to fix it . <p> The Photoshop dialogue at right highlights the adjustment tool you 'll be looking for . By specifying a positive or negative integer , you control how much space displays between each letter . This is the same spot you 'd go to kern . Note that your cursor has to be placed between two letters in order to work , without either highlighted . <p> For the purposes of our aliasing however , were not so much concerned about the letter spacing as we are of where the type falls on the pixel grid . By playing with the values , its possible to bump each letter off whatever axis is causing it to render sloppy , and tighten up the letters . <p> The dropdown shown above has some default values you can choose from , but often times you 'll want to add a number in between those , which you have to type . That gets tedious . I just discovered this week that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mac or ALT + ( left or right arrow ) Win , you can adjust the spacing in increments of 20 , which in most cases is good enough . <p> Compare and contrast the above images . Subtle changes can make a world of difference to final legibility . 30455 @qwx890455 30451 @qwx890451 <p> You are reading " Type : the Extra Mile " , an entry posted on 18 January , 2004 , to the No Stopping collection .

@@99593569 @3793569/ <p> With a few caveats and a bit of apprehension , I present to you my latest pet project : The CSS Zen Garden . ( also available on its own domain ) <p> Inspired in roughly equal parts by Chris Cascianos Daily CSS Fun and rant ( of which I strongly share the same opinion ) , the recent Hack Hotbot contest , and an independent idea I 've had stuck in my head forever , I finally committed to creating this . I think its needed . Even if its not , I think itll be fun . <p> Now for the caveats : Macs are quirky little devils , are n't  they ? I have it on good word that some of the designs work jes fine in Safari and IE for Mac , while others do not . Having no Mac testing machine at the present time presents a bit of a problem in squashing those bugs . One of them is still a bit weird in IE5/Win , but I 'm fixing that soon . Basically , my caveats boil down to : my CSS is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work out our differences . <p> The goal was to hit some important milestones : I wanted to create a page that allows for some wildly different CSS designs , while coding valid XHTML 1.1 , valid CSS , and conforming to Section 508 and AAA accessibility guidelines . Time will tell how successful the former is , but the technical requirements were met . <p> Anyway , enjoy . I hope to address to quirky browser incompatibilities ASAP . Special thanks to Paul and Kris for the Mac screenshots . <p> Mmmm . I hate to admit it , but I love the bloodlust design . Its the kind of design that can make graphics designers sit up and get excited about CSS . It kind of reminds me of the experimental designs from the Age of Tables &amp; Fonts . <p> Stormweather is my next favorite . Altogether , lovely designs , all of them . Now , if you do n't  mind , i 'm going to go sit in the corner and weep silently at my humbled design skills : - ) <p> Once again Dave , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When I get a chance I 'll have to take some time and crank out my own CSS and zap it your way . Things look pretty good in Safari and IE5 Mac . If you need any screen shots or Mac checks just let me know . <p> Thanks all for the great comments ! I 'm very encouraged by the response Ive been getting so far . I was a bit worried that I 'd be eaten alive for some of the Mac quirks , and it seems that newer versions of Mozilla are having issues . Stormweather as a whole is quite the problem spot I think I 'd better look into that one . <p> And I think its okay to like Blood Lust , Sherif . ; ) I 'm rather fond of that one too , mainly because its completely different than what I 'd normally do . I 'm quite interested in seeing what kind of submissions I end up getting . I hope this project can substantially raise the bar for CSS design . <p> Wow , nice work . There are a few small problems in Safari @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across , and small glitches aside , they are still usable . Ill check it on my PC at work to get the full effect . <p> First off ALL the pages are extremely visually attractive . Its almost impossible to believe that the little bit XHTML ended looking so nice . But what shocked me more was when the styles were turn off . The page rendered perfectly , everything was structured correctly and in its place . <p> While many site use CSS+XHTML most look like crap with the styles off or viewed in a browser like lynx . Content that is supposed to be at the end of page ends up somewhere in the middle and long lists of text are often lined at the bottom . I 'm a big supporter of proper HTML first CSS second and the demonstration page demonstrates that beautifully . It does n't  even make an attempt to cater to a particular medium making perfect sense on screen or in print ( or in audio for that matter ) . Bottom line wonderful demonstration all around . <p> Good to see such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ response it deserves ! <p> A little healthy competition and a truckload of zesty submissions could really change the tone of " The CSS Debate " when folks see what you can DO with CSS instead of repeatedly being told why they should do it . 30455 @qwx890455 30451 @qwx890451 <p> You are reading " CSS Zen Garden " , an entry posted on 7 May , 2003 , to the Placid collection .

@@99593570 @3793570/ <p> Sending ripples of joy/shock/fear through the web development community , Macromedia announced Contribute this weekend , a $99US content editing system . <h> The Golden Age ? <p> The smarter web shops have realized that the best approach to site updating comes through enabling the client to literally do it themselves . Comfortable with competition like Vignette , Interwoven and Microsofts Content Management Server pricing into the hundreds of thousands of dollars , many have elected to create their own Content Management Systems , allowing control over page layout , text formatting , image libraries and more . <p> Revenue comes from licensing this proprietary technology , and comfortable margins are generated by licensing the software . Content Management has become the new eCommerce to the developer , a revival of an industry that was starting to doubt its own feasibility . <h> And so the Bottom Drops <p> But along with these high margins comes a hidden price . After having spent long months and even years developing these products , the news of a cheap replacement comes along to destroy that sense of security . While @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is still an awful lot of time and money tied up in many companies systems . <p> The release of a single product does n't  precipitate the death knell for the independent CMS developer , since free systems have long been available . However , its certainly no comfort to those who have invested in their systems without already recouping the cost . It can now be done cheaper , quicker , and since Contribute ( based on the Dreamweaver engine ) generates W3C standards-friendly code , it can possibly even be done better . <p> What Macromedia offers with this program is a sense of stability and legitimacy . Buying into an Open Source CMS is cheap initially , but the hidden costs manifest in highmargin external or onstaff support . Middleoftheroad developers are able to offer support , but resources are more usefully tied up in development . Macromedia thus provides a trusted name brand , as well as a tiein to existing , wellsupported products like Dreamweaver . <h> All is not Lost . <p> While this is a rather large shock to those who assumed they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The program has n't  been released yet , and even when it ships , it will be Windowsonly for a while yet . The $99 license will most likely be a singleprocessor license , requiring multiple purchases for companies wishing to allow access control to more than a single individual . And of course , as always , the site does n't  create itself . <h> What Once Was , Becomes Again <p> And that really is the core of the matter : development is what it once was all about , and now , again , it becomes the raison dOtre . Developers do n't  like maintenance , and clients do n't  like paying for any more than they have to . The promise of the Content Mangement System is now more poignant than ever , and it becomes vitally important for the small developer to focus less on the creation of the tools , and more on their deployment and use . <p> Let 's leave the distraction behind and focus on the goal . Let 's stop worrying about the process and start concentrating on the end result . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ improving the hammer . 30454 @qwx890454 <p> Agreed ! Nicely said . Web designing and development is not " cut and paste " . Let 's let the client have control of that . <p> I 've resisted Content Management Systems up to now because my clients have resisted paying the $1,500 to $2,000 price tag for any CMS that I could find to recommend . Yes , that will be a hole for the developer of these types of systems but they can use their coding and programming skills to fill another niche . <p> This is a very thoughtful piece . You have eloquently described our thinking about this issue : help with the content management problem and thus free up designers and developers to advance their skills and create new highly valuable applications . Ill stop there , your post says it better than I could . <p> PeggyTake a look at Zope - not all effective CMSs have big ticket licensing costs - this one has a license cost of $0 . Although in my day job , I use Vignette , Interwoven , the MS CMS etc @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wholeheartedly recommend Zope to any independent developer and SME clients . Hell , I use it for my personal site . <p> A good piece , definitely . I am surprised at the reactions I 'm seeing regarding Contribute perhaps everyone has a new product rush of blood : ) Its not a perfect solution , its not a " CMS killer " . It seems to me that its just an attempt at getting rid of " move that comma " update hell . At work were currently investigating whether it will actually help - we use a staging/production server pair . So we suspect the extra files will turn into cruft on the production server but we will wait and see . 30455 @qwx890455 30451 @qwx890451 <p> You are reading " Macromedia Contribute vs. the Developer .

@@99593571 @3793571/ <p> The Hack Hotbot contest winners are slated to be announced today , so its time I tell my tale . Where to begin A longish summary of the story thus far is found in parts one , two , three , and four . <p> But a quick summary because that 's a lot of text to get through : Terra Lycos ran a CSS design contest open to US residents only . I complained on here and linked the contest . An employee found the link and emailed me , telling me I should enter , but obviously did n't  bother reading that I was Canadian and therefore ineligible . I responded . They told me to enter through a US citizen . I did . <p> And I won . Grand prize was a huge TV , and two first place prizes were 20GB iPods . I took one of the first place spots . I was informed back in the beginning of May , and the past month has been spent figuring out what in the world is going on . A big thanks to Lincoln @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two ) and Corey Matthews of Terra Lycos , and Douglas Bowman of Stop Design for helping me out , but their legal department decided I was n't allowed to win . <p> Naturally I 'm disappointed . I spend a lot of time working on various projects with no expectation of compensation , so when something like this comes along that I throw myself into , I figure its a way of getting something in return . But not this time . <p> Maybe I should have known better . I had a bad feeling about the contest from the start . A World Wide Web design competition only open to US citizens bad move . An employee spamming me to enter without reading the front page entry on why I could n't bad move . Code that was hard to work with and offered little to actually hack about the design bad move . Changing the code after the contest ended , thus breaking the entries really bad move . And the past month of dwindling communication pretty much cemented that they werent going to award me the prize , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The silver lining in all of this is that while not directly inspired by it , a byproduct of my discontent with the contest was that we got a Zen Garden out of it . And the Zen Garden seems to be leading to some exciting opportunities for me , personally . So I cant help but take a Zenlike approach and realize that in the grand scheme of things , I won anyway . It would have been nice to have an iPod , but I suppose it was n't in the cards . <p> update : I cant believe I missed him , but Joshua Kaufman also deserves some credit for the CSS work he did on the project . While his code did n't  end up in my final submission , he did some great work as we hacked away together at this difficult challenge . <p> Surprisingly , a lot of the stuff was directly transferable from my stylesheet . For example , my footer uses an i 'd of footer just like the zen template , while other stuff was as simply as changing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I got ta tell you the truth about these US only contestswe ca n't allow people like you in because we like to win ! Hehe , but honestly that really sucks . The world is now a better place with Zen Garden . <p> Still no results posted on that page as of right now . But if you 've been informed , it sounds final . As a former employee at Lycos , I 'm ashamed of them , and I know other current employees are too . I 'm glad it pushed you to create the Zen Garden . But , publicly stated , this blows . <p> Sorry to hear the news , Dave . Its really a shame they could n't have their act more together than that . You can live knowing that one of the best CSS communities knows who the real winner is , and you 'll be remembered for it . Keep up the excellent work and cheers . <p> You got robbed , but the other posts are correct : Zen Garden is definitely compensation . I 'm starting with CSS and the resources here have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &amp; CSS . Thanks ! <p> On Zen Garden : I 'm learning CSS for the first time . Zen Garden is exactly what I need : it shows me what can be done , and hints at what ca n't . It was the second link I tried on the w3c site ( the first being a tutorial ) . Lots of nice code to inspire me . An excellent resource . <p> On that prize business : <p> Astonishing ! OK , I can respect the limitation of their legal department . But there are two obvious responses : <p> ( 1 ) Get the permission of the person who whould otherwise have won - theyd be pretty much honour bound to recognize you . <p> ( 2 ) Donate an extra prize with an honourable mention and note that you would have won if you were in the US . <p> Pretty crazy , really , the damage to their image must be worth far more than the prize ( probably the fee for the lawyer taking the decision was worth more than the prize too ) .

@@99593572 @3793572/ <p> Ethan , excellent find ! The big news for today is that it is possible to get multiple versions of Internet Explorer running on a single Windows box . <p> Joe Maddalone has written up the process in detail , and while there could be a couple of tweaks to make it easier to understand , I was able to follow it and verify that , yes indeed , IE5.01 , 5.5 and 6.0 can all run on the same computer . here 's my screenshot of IE5.01 in action on an XP box normally running IE6.0 . <p> Great thinking Jon , this is exactly what we need ! Now the question is , as Matt Haughey puts it , what possible explanation would keep them from releasing the simple info and making developers the world over happier to use MS products ? I 'm hoping to get an answer . Stay tuned . <p> My brain just about exploded when I saw how cool this was . I plan to keep these up as long as humanly possible , and I will try to add Windows 98/Me-compatible versions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as long as Microsoft does n't  kick my ass over it . = ) <p> There is a fairly legitimate box model correction technique that does not work with IE5. * installed in this manner . The idea is to use a proprietary hack to solve a proprietary problem , calling in a stylesheet with box model corrections in this manner : &lt; ! if lt IE 6&gt; &lt;style type= " text/css " title= " stylesheet " media= " all " &gt; @import **26;2033;TOOLONG ; &lt;/style&gt; &lt; ! endif&gt; The problem is that while these stand alone installations behave in every manner like IE5. * , they think that they are IE6 . Go to Help -&gt; About to see what I mean . <p> For Linux users the possibility to run multiple versions of IE has existed as long as Wine ( http : //www.winehq.com ) was able to run them . Just create different wine installations and wrapper scripts for each of them . Instructions for IE501 , IE5.5 and IE6-SP1 are available at http : //frankscorner.org/ <p> The only problem I 've encountered so far was that IE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Last year I installed IE3 on XP under the impression that it could co-exist with IE6 thinking it was the last standalone version of the browser before being integrated into the OS ( mabe it was IE2 ? ) . Let 's just say I really messed up my system . IE3 was running fine , but IE6 was trashed and I was getting all sorts of system errors and had to do a reinstall . So I am bit reluctant to try this myself until I know its safe . So to those brave souls out there : have you noticed any weirdness yet ? <p> These do n't  have an installer . They 're just files that are zipped up . You can unzip them anywhere you want , and the only files that will run are the ones in the unzipped folder . <p> I 've added more of the downloads to my site , **34;2061;TOOLONG , to include 98/Me versions of the browsers as well . I 've also posted an IE6 which I 'm about to test under 98 and 2000 ( where IE5.x is the installed version ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them posted until Microsoft forces me to take them down . <p> Ryan : " These do n't  have an installer . They 're jusr files that are zipped up . " Brilliant ! Ryan : " I 'll keep them posted until Microsoft forces me to take them down . " Hopefully by then enough of us will have copies/mirrors availableBrilliant ! Nils : " The idea is to use a proprietary hack to solve a proprietary problem " I use conditional comments on my site to feed IE5 specific style rules to deal with its box model and you are correct : IE5/IE5.5 standalones think they are IE6 , and thus , do not obey the comments . <p> " to use conditional comments ( and besides , there are other good ways to feed IE-specific styles to IE only . ) " Other methods , like the voice family hack , have validation issues which is why I choose to use conditional comments and see nothing wrong with doing so . This , of course , is besides the point anyways . The issue here is simply people noting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ therefore you should be aware of the differences whether or not you personally use scripts or conditional comments . " In conclusion , life is now better for web developers . Joe Maddalone , you rock my world . " No argument there . <p> " 1 . IE 5.0 and IE 5.5 behave like themselves , but think that they are IE 6 . This only matters if one is using browser detection scripts. " ( from comment #15 ) <p> Hmm , I probably should do a bit of testing before posting . Apparently , the hacked IE5.0 and IE5.5 browsers send out the proper user agent string ; that is , they identify themselves asthemselves . The only place where they wrongly claim to be IE6.0 is under Help -&gt; About . <p> So it looks as though browser detection DOES work for the hacked IEs . Try going to www.browserhawk.com using one of the hacked IEs ; the correct browser was detected when I did . <p> Best news I 've heard in a whilejust dloaded 5.01 and 5.5 SP2 and have got them all up and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ working in IE5.x * <p> * O/T : if anybody has had some unexplainable behaviour in IE5.x and is stumped , are you using the original Tantek box model hack ? I found its caused me no end of rendering grief and reccomend switching to the high pass method instead . <p> A much more elegant solution is to just run VMWare . Yes its pricey , but for development , it ca n't be beat . I have everything from IE 2.0 running on NT4 to the latest browsers on XP and Linux ; all running on virtual machines . <p> Just out of interest , ( and in in no way do I mean to devalue Joes achievement ) , if it was this easy - does n't  it make a mockery of MSs various depositions to the effect that it is n't really possible to separate the browser from the OS ? <p> This works brilliantly with only two small problems that I can see- helpabout gives the wrong browser version and trying to access the favorites menu crashes the browser . Accessing the favorites from the sidebar works @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about this ? I cant believe that its through ignorance and Microsoft must have had thousands of requests from developers wanting to run multiple versions of IE on the same machine . <p> Surely it ca n't be because they thought that having more than one version of IE running on the same PC would undermine their court case ? <p> I remember the good old days of being able to run IE4 and IE5 side-by-side ( in " compatibility mode " or something ) . This is fantastic , useful beyond expression , and so mind-numbingly mundane to users of just about any other browser you care to mention nice one , Microsoft . <p> hmmm , let 's see : not as elegant but completely free vs. elegnat but expensive ? each to their own i guesif you have money to burn ( a corporate budget or something ) then yes , by all means . even more elegant : a room full of PCs all running the different versions of IE , and a troupe of assistants to hit the F5 whenever you upload a new version ; ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need adjustment now , e.g. the font size on this very page , which suffers from IE5s poorer inheritence control , I suspect . <p> Does the 3MB zip file size of each IE5 version suggest that IE is actually quite a lightweight browser ? Or that each are using other files shared with IE6 elsewhere on the system ( in which case , how can we be sure that those files are the same , i.e. result in a genuine IE5 output ? ) . <p> Its a good possibility that MS did n't  know about this , because they are concerned about their software fully functioning as they intend it to ( well , in theory ) . These standalones might work for web testing , but are nontheless just hacked versions that barely fulfill their functionality requirements . I doubt MS would spend the time to figure all this stuff out themselves because they would never release such a hacked version , or the details on how to do it , to the public . <p> I am surprised that someone has n't  created a single piece @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has used since version 3 , and can even report as the appropriate user agent . While they were at it , why not just add emulation modes for all the appropriate browsers ? If I was a programmer , I would get on that right away . But I 'm not . <p> I 'm hoping that this is caused by the implementation of features shared between the browsers and its not an indication of deeper problems that cast doubt on the behavioural integrity of each browser . <p> having no luck with the zip versions for win98. the exes just seem to load the currently installed ie6 version . unzipped them both to a new folder on my system , tested user agent against browserhawk.com and tried some css but everything is just ie6 still for both the 5.5 and 5.01 exes. for example if i run the 5.01 exe , and then click a shortcut for an html file , it will not open in a new window but just load in the window open for 5.01. so clearly for some reason the 5.01exe/5.5exe are just loading ie6 still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that off , reinstalled ie6sp1 , and still no difference . trawled the registry for any pointers , but after 4 hrs frustration not sure what else i can try ! anyone tried the win98 versions , or any advice for this PLEASE PLEASE ! ! feel i am missing out on something monumental here . <p> The version string within the dialog box IE grabs from the registry LONG ...

I attempted an uninstall , choosing the option to " Return to previous Windows configuration " . All went fine until I re-booted . The un-installer had forgotten to put back a load of the old files - leaving me with no access to programs etc . I was running WinME on that box at the time , so my attempts to hit Ctrl+Alt+Del and run Explorer.exe from the Task Manager were fruitless . <p> Anyway , the point of that is to show that a lot of the files that IE uses are part of Windows .

@@99593574 @3793574/ <p> Somehow over the last year or two we 've landed in a situation where most browsers now default to full page zoom instead of traditional text-resizing . <p> Opera has long used zoom instead of text scaling ; as of IE7 Internet Explorer uses zoom to replace the older resizing method ; Firefox 3 now defaults to zoom as well . Safari is really the only holdout at this point ( and I suppose Chrome by extension , since they both run the same WebKit rendering engine ) but , oh look , its coming soon to a future release . <p> Now its true that Firefox and Internet Explorer still offer the ability to scale text as they always have , but a user has to look for it ; if there 's anything we 've learned from that latter browser its that users are n't  inclined to change default choices on their computers , so I think its safe to assume most users will employ the newer method , if at all . <p> The implications on a designer are fairly dramatic ; page zoom is an attempt to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whereas text scaling simply reflows the text , often causing serious layout problems . With full page zoom , the responsibility for ensuring page integrity and legibility is moved out of the designers hands , and placed fully on the browser . With text resizing , the designer needs to be conscientious of the ways their layout will break at different text sizes , and compensate accordingly . <p> So , personal preference aside , I wonder whether designing around scaling text is still a skill we need to hold on to , and for how long . I 'd be interested in hearing about reasons for and against , as I 'm sure there will be both . <p> This is a good observation . I recently starting designing completely with ems using the 62.5% method . Now it looks like that might be in vain and I might as well start using pixels . <p> Either way , I still plan on using ems because I know how to use them and if nothing else , it will still apply to older browsers . But for newer designers learning CSS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Like anything , I suppose its a benefit versus time issue . As all the major browsers line up behind zoom , scaling text layout breaks become less and less of a potential mishap . <p> I would personally prefer to avoid having to worry about text-resizing layout breaks , as that 's always been ( for me at least ) a headache to deal with . <p> Despite that , its probably something that youd want to be more careful with when working on sites more likely to be viewed by seniors who will make use of text-resizing . <p> For example , some sites I 'm regularly working on include one for expatriate retirees and one for senior citizen health care . I 'm going to guess that at least a portion of that user base will have font-resizing active . <p> So although I 'd like to say " Yes , let 's not worry about it anymore , " a better response is probably " Let 's worry about it in select cases only . " Which is at least an improvement over earlier years . <p> One of the things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that as default layouts get wider ( 960px ) they need to remeber to take zooming into account to avoid horizontal scrolling , especially for low vision users . <p> Browsers still allow users to set a default font-size though , yeah ? I have n't explored this , but I wonder if the low-vision users who have increased this default font size will see a page that is " broken " from the very start , rather than the user who breaks the page manually using ctrl+ ? So page-zoom works around those designers who insist on fonts much smaller than the mean , but may not serve those users who are trying to adjust all websites for their less-than-perfect vision . <p> I guess the question is , how ? With text sizing you could test and correct positioning and adjust font sizes ; with page zoom being so firmly controlled by the browser , I 'm do n't  know if there are many things that can be done to compensate at a CSS level . <p> I think that , as of today , designing with text-only scaling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ web page , as it forces the author to make more rational choices , despite being , perhaps , less creative ( or creative other ways ) . <p> But , if this page-zoom thing will be adopted by all the major browsers , as it seems , this simply wont be valid anymore , because theoretically we should be safe all the time . <p> As far as horizontal scrolling bars are concerned , it will depend on how browsers actually implement that feature . <p> One way could be having horizontal scrolling bars , that means no controls at all on the layouts width ; another option would be continuing with text-only resizing , once the windows width limit has been reached by the layout container . Ok this would be a little too imaginative , hehe . <p> As a user I 'm still not sure whether I prefer the zoom option or the text-only option in FF3 . I find myself going back and forth between the 2 settings . Of course , as you state in your article , if the page zoom becomes de facto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in pixels and stop worrying about ems . <p> Personally , I hate page zoom . I often resize text on web pages because my fellow web designers often seem to think that 10 px Arial looks pretty . In fact , I have my multi-button mouse setup with text resize shortcuts and they get used daily . I 'm not old , I just do n't  like reading tiny 10 or 11 px text on my 24 " monitor . In 13 years of web development , I 've never built a site that could n't resize . However , many websites fail to take resize into account . So as a result of poor coding and amateur developers , we now seem to be stuck with zooming . Ugh . <p> So should we still code for resizing ? Yes . Of course . Because its the right thing to do and it does n't  take any more effort ( if you know what you 're doing ) . <p> I 'm with the pro-font-resizing crowd on this one ; other than the extra time , there does n't  seem to be any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; full-page zoom will work regardless . <p> I , too , have been thinking on this front recently . Creating designs that gracefully scale with the text size ( to a certain degree ) has always been one of those things I strive for because I think its too often ignored . Em-based thinking is a way of life ( at least whilst staring at CSS code ) . <p> But if you consider why we use ems , it is because this is the best unit treated relatively by all browsers . The specs , however , define the pixel as relative to the screen resolution . So switching to pixel-based dimensioning ( which is easier even if you are an experienced em ninja ) , equally adheres to the specification . Its good to see the browsers coming around to the standards . <p> For the time being , I think we still need to consider our layout with text-resizing and not zooming , but we can be much more relaxed about it and shoot for plain legibility and not the integrity of the design . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go of text resizing as the browser makers move to page zoom over text zoom . <p> I 've long decried the complicated maths involved in getting things the way you want them using relatively-sized text , and touted the wondrous simplicity of sizing text absolutely . Of course , historically , its been a bit of a pipe dream , because using absolutely-sized text introduced serious accessibility issues . Today , I think those accessibility issues are mostly gone . IE6 usage is on the decline , and I think its fair to suggest that most low-vision users who need to resize text probably realized long ago that IE6 did n't  allow them to do so on all websites . I would love to see stats on exactly how many users who NEED to re-size text still use IE6 or lower . I 'd bet its remarkably low most of them have moved on to better browsers . Given that , I think its fairly safe to assume that virtually everyone who needs to resize text will be able to ( whether through page zoom or text resize ) , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go forward . <p> Well , there is a huge field where we still have to care about scaling text , and it 's called " fluid layouts " . <p> If you design your page with percentages , the page zoom function of modern browsers ( IE 7 is an exception here ) will scale the text , but not the column width . Thus it is not that much different to traditional text scaling , right ? <p> Zooming cant ( yet ) be considered perfect . I 've noticed in FF3 that at some zoom levels , lines break differently than they do at 100% . Theres potential there for overflow onto an additional line , and anyone who has n't  planned for that may not be pleased with the result . <p> " Today , I think those accessibility issues are mostly gone . IE6 usage is on the decline , and I think it 's fair to suggest that most low-vision users who need to resize text probably realized long ago that IE6 did n't allow them to do so on all websites . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and even the IE8 beta . Remarkably , this is a glitch that Microsoft kept sticking to for some reason , even when the majority feel as though its a bug . <p> So , we cant forget to factor that into our decisions on how we size text . IE users ( any version ) wont be able to resize text set in pixels . <p> Yet another plus for page zoom I suppose . <p> Personally , one of the reasons I like sizing with ems , is that it forces you to be flexible not only for resizing text , but for allowing varying amounts of content as well . Blowing up the text was always an easy way to test for the integrity of various design components , answering the question : what will happen if there 's more " stuff " here ? Relative units allow for future expansion , last-minute edits , or ham-fisted modifications . <p> Its probably a good idea to leave a little buffer for the people that use text scaling . For now I 'll give them one bump up and still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up two or more times and for it not to effect the layout is asking for too much . I like the new zoom function of most browsers but I agree with others that it could cause problems with wider sites . <p> When I suggested that IE7+ users could " resize " text set in pixels , I meant they could make the type bigger by doing page zoom . The point is : every browser in wide use today and not named IE6 has some kind of provision for letting users resize text . In some its page zoom and in others its text resize , but the bottom line is that people can make their fonts bigger . <p> I 'd be surprised if this newfangled Safari-specific zoom wasnt based partially on their work on Safari for the iPhone . <p> Oh , and I 'm all for dropping support for text zoom . It saves me lots of time , let 's me use absolute units for typesetting , and I think its a more forward-thinking approach to the issue anyways . Any time browser technology takes the brunt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a good thing . Of course , there 's much more to accessibility than just legibility , some of which will always be the designers problem to solve , but the more time we have to spend on those issues , the better . <p> I think there may still be room for the liquid layout techniques and percentage based font sizing considering a user experience for mobile web browsing that needs to translate to the conventional desktop browser . <p> Wow that was a really fucking long sentence . <p> Anyhow , check out Radiohead remix site in a conventional browser and then the iPhone Safari : <p> Aesthetic and color choice aside : it works rather well in both a mobile and desk context . While not using percentages I think such an effect could be achieved with more utility/awareness of said context to better effect . The experience is a little overwhelming in the standard browser . <p> The 62.5% method is fundamentally broken , so you should certainly stop doing that . <p> On the original question - the default font size still varies across individuals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still important to use units that are relative to the text size . This is especially important for people who specify a minimum font size , because for them page zoom still wont mean unit sizes scaling equally with text sizes . <p> I wonder if its worth deliberately designing and working with the highest-resolution , smallest screens around ? ? <p> Designing in pixels is a real killer for people viewing sites on mobile phones ( where physical pixel size is so much smaller . ) And working with a low resolution inevitably leads to small font-sizes as you usually want to fit more on-screen ( words , lines columns . ) <p> Were suggesting the same thing in our book . Full-page zoom is going to obsolete the current best practice pretty rapidly . And as far as mobile applications go , they 've been doing their own thing for layout for some time now , so its going to do more good than harm overall . <p> There 's a good design reason for this move , and its the same reason the OS vendors went to device-independent display @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with some displays topping out at 200ppi now , and getting higher . None of the numbers necessarily correspond to anything in the physical world anymore . Its going to be the users prerogative to display their browser window in whatever proportion and magnification they see fit . And hey , anything that mainstreams what used to be strictly an accessibility feature is aces in my book . <p> Dave , this seems like a similar question to the issue of designing for 1024px or larger viewports . The tipping point is hard to determine without good data . Use of GIE6 may still be relatively high in some non-first world , public sector , or corporate environments . Designers of sites other than those being narrowcast to the technical elite may have to consider that . <p> As Dan also pointed out , IE7+ zoom is buggy . It would seem that as GIE6 usage declines , there exists a window of opportunity for the IE team to refine the bugs out of their zoom . Then the question might be , why mix absolute and relative values ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hack to workaround the lack of SVG or scalable background images but still enable text resizing . Relative lengths for all elements may have a small overhead in development but inheritance makes them much easier to maintain afterwards . <p> 1 . Content is king , and the main content on the web is text . Most of the time I do not care about images at all , I am interested in the text . Bitmap images do n't  necessarily zoom well either . A badly zoomed image is n't always helpful . <p> 2 . The zoom feature in Firefox 3 is interesting : if you have a layout that allows text re-sizing : no horizontal scrolling . Do n't  believe me ? Test it ! <p> 3 . The zoom feature in IE8 is even worse than the zoom feature in IE7 , which was pretty bad . It does indeed , stuff up your layout . <p> 4 . Horizontal scrolling is harmful to the user ; they may not know there is anything on the right hand side of the page , continually scrolling back and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . To up text sizes , you need to into options and set the default text larger . That works well for one site , but that cascades over to the next you are looking at , which allows you to set decent sized text , and now you have to go back into tools &gt; Options &gt;Advanced Fonts and Colors in order to get the text size on that one site back to normal . This is annoying to do for every site . WHich is what happens . It is a really bad user experience with the browser . <p> 6 . Just because MIE does it , does n't  mean it is a good thing . Nor does anyone else have to do it . If MIE jumped off a cliff , would Firefox follow ? <p> I 've long been upset by the state of browser text-size shifting , simply because it makes marking up pages semantically essentially impossible . So many extra containers are required to manage fluid-sized text , especially in situations where user-generated content is common and uncontrollable . <p> I like the idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to increase a little every year , and widescreens become the norm in desktop environments . <p> I 'm not sure the horizonal scrollbar confusion argument holds water : if its something you 're really worried about , you can discover if the browser window is smaller than your document size with some basic scripting and notify users of the content hidden offscreen or , reflow your layout to accomodate the smaller viewport . <p> As others have said , not everyone pays attention to the potential for reflowing larger ( or smaller ! ) text in the browser window , and so often this breaks the layout . Usually these developers are the very same ones who set their font size to criminally-unreadable sizes . Resizing the text makes the page both more and less legible , in that case . I 'd rather have a visually-coherent , horizontally-scrolling document than a broken , non-horizontally one . <p> Im annoyed that in such a massive ( now ) industry ( web ) , we still need to allow for software that was developed so long ago ( in internet years ! ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opt for developing in ways that allow for expansion and modularity . Is hardcoding font sizes is not an example of this . We 've all known this . I just ca n't believe were still here talking about it . <p> The problem though , even now , is the pork-barrel and special-interest-laden browser-smiths . Is it not ? <p> Josh made a very important observation back in comment 4 : Users still have the ability to set a different default ( and minimum ! ) font-size . Its basically as if they always use text-zoom . The percentage of users wholl do this will be small , but its likely to be exactly the same percentage of users for which we were setting up em-based designs in the first place . We really should n't break their world just because our emulation method has changed away from text-zoom-by-default . <p> To all those thinking about dropping support for traditional text resizing in favor of zoom , please consider using flexible widths/fluid layouts . <p> This website beautifully fits into a 1024x768 window , however when I zoom the navigation disappears off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the article , causing me to scroll horizontally to read each line ; this is n't a great user experience . <p> If this website were to scale to the with of my window , zooming would actually work great ( try zooming my website http : **25;2135;TOOLONG for an example ) . <p> Safari/Mac uses Cocoa , and Apple has ported some Cocoa-like API to Windows so that Safari/Win can use the same API . I do n't  think Google can use this Cocoa-like API on Windows . In fact , Chrome uses Skia instead . <p> Personally , I find zooming to be a step backward . In theory , it sounds nice to have the entire design scale but I dislike how zooming almost always results in horizontal scrolling . From a users perspective , I find it easier to scale the text while retaining my browser width . In short : zooming looks better because the design remains intact but I still believe text scaling to be better as far as usability . <p> In my humble opinion , until browsers that do n't  support text zoom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practice of using ems over pixels is the best choice . It takes a more inclusive approach . Sure , most browsers are using or will soon be using page zoom , but there will still be the user group who prefers text zoom to page zoom or the person with low-vision who found text zoom is a better option for them " a group that , at least in the U.S. , is increasing every year . The approach of being inclusive was most basic principle of the standards movement , so why not continue with that . It shouldnt affect how page zoom works , but will give those people who have found that text zoom works best for them , what they need and deserve . <p> One of the core problems I found with page zoom is very long lines that could become difficult to read , especially for low vision users or those with narrow-angle vision . I have also found that in development I also get the same benefits that Dan Cederholm mentioned earlier . In regards to the time required I found that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " as I was " it becomes second nature with little impact time on time lines . Yes , there might be little more math involved , but its become second nature . Also if you keep a personal library of your code , over time you have to do less and less math , because you have already done it . <p> So I put a in a vote for continuing to use ems over pixels . <p> I will say that this is a very important discussion to have . We air the facts , the opinions , and all our options . That way , all of us who thinking about this issue " now or in the future " can see it all and make their own decisions . As I said mine will still be ems for the foreseeable future <p> Cocoa and Skia are actually the interface frameworks that contain the rendering engine , which is Webkit in both cases . Cocoa and Skia are not the rendering engine . They are things like the buttons you see in the browser bar , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generates what you see based on the HTML , CSS , JavaScript , etc. in the viewport . That is Webkit and is separate from Cocoa or Skia . They just talk back and forth . <p> Hmmm , interesting topic . I 've always designed and built out sites in such a way that text resizing will not break the design . Recently , I also had the chance to implement a layout with em based widths , which allows the entire site to expand ( height and width ) with the browsers text size setting . In a way , it simulates " zooming " functions of newer browsers . If the default functionality of browsers should continue in this zooming direction , then I would imagine that designing for text resizing would definitely be less of a priority . <p> There is also the possibility of low vision users , who are much more likely to change their text size settings , or turn on accessibility settings . <p> It seems as if a few different , separate issues have popped up in the comments here . Let 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ems vs . Pixels <p> This is a re-hashing of the very old IE6 discussion . But I think it needs to be said that its entirely possible to set all your type in ems and still end up with a design that causes problems when text is scaled up even 10% . So , this is a related issue , but I do n't  think its the core issue . <p> 2 ) Fixed vs . Fluid layouts <p> Admittedly I have n't dug very deep into full page zoom , but its clear enough that different browsers have different ways of handling fixed layouts . Horizontal scrollbars are the main issue here ; fluid layouts seem to adapt better . <p> 3 ) User defaults <p> The argument seems to be if a user has their font size set to a size they prefer using the older browser controls , then not supporting text resizing means they suffer . I just checked : FF3 and Opera persist the zoom setting ( though FF does it on a site-by-site basis ) , whereas IE7 is the only one that forgets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constraints <p> So far the only concrete reason Ive been hearing against continuing to support text resizing is that it saves development time . <p> The thing is , its not just text reflow problems that we are designing for , its flexibility in general . <p> So an area that would have broken before when the text was resized does n't  break anymore because of page zoom Well that area will still break when a few extra sentences of text are added to that area . <p> There I talked about how NS4 and IE5 users are n't  really worth perfecting your site for because most websites has got to be screwed up for them already . <p> Text resizing is very similar . Outside of body text , I feel comfortable saying that most websites look screwed up when you start changing the base font size . <p> Sure , itd be great if we could provide every user on every platform with every conceivable setting a perfect experience . But most people who use fringe software and unusual settings have already decided that the benefits of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to them . <p> @Chris Coyier - that 's a good general point , but not always applicable . Consider simple UI elements that need a few words at most ; say a button , or a navigation item , or a login link , or and so on . Theyll likely never change , or at least never grow dramatically so your starting point is fairly fixed . Text resizing has always been a huge thorn in the side in those cases , but full page zoom magically makes the problem go away . <p> &gt; So far the only concrete reason I 've been hearing against continuing to support text resizing is that it saves development time . <p> Clearly this is the only reason . No one would argue that using relative sizes gives your site more flexibility . But let 's not brush off saving development time as insignificant . I do n't  know about you , but I 'm always working on a tight deadline . <p> To me , using relative sizes is going to end up one of those things you *can* do to impress your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you much in the real world . Were not quite there yet , but I think its obvious were heading that direction . <p> Also , I think people are confusing the topics of text resizing and layout flexibility . Daves article is all about *text* he did n't  make mention of how you size divs and other layout containers . <p> There will probably always be some need for layout flexibility , as Dan alluded to . However , you do n't  need to set your *type* in ems or percentages to get it . You can certainly size your layout containers relatively to maximize flexibility and your type absolutely to save development time these things are n't  mutually exclusive . <p> Ill be glad to let go of some of the trickier bits associated with text resizing ( like keeping navigation legible ) but many of the tricks we 've learned to accommodate text-resizing are still useful for cases where the content might end up longer than it was in the design phase . At least our skills wont be totally useless . : - ) <p> I want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resizing I am referring to . Almost everything I have built up until this point has been ems based for the reasons I have stated above . It 's about the user " their needs and desires " not about showing off . I am sorry if that was unclear . <p> I 've dropped optimizing the projects I 've been working on for text-resize . I definitely think that , full page zoom is going to stay , and exactly as mentioned , must of the internet/computer users do n't  change their standard settings , and with MS pushing of updates they make sure , that those users will get the full page zoom also . <p> Browsers will always be ably to change text-size - in addition to or instead of page zoom . <p> For instance : Opera has had page-zoom for longest , but it also has an option for overriding text-size . Similar options can be found in all browsers that have page-zoom now , and I do n't  think that will change anytime soon . <p> I always take the browsers options into account while designing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of those options . For us to not account for what browsers can do , will cause problems for some users . <p> I wrote about this topic months ago on my blog but unfortunately ca n't link to it because were having major server problems . Grrrr .. <p> I too question the need to build em-based layouts when most browsers no longer scale text that way . Its a lot of work for a small minority of users . It would useful to see some stats on how low vision users resize text and which method they prefer . It could be that most users with severe vision problems use screen zooming software instead of the web browsers text scaling ( if they cant read text at a few sizes above default they probably cant read the program interface either ) . <p> So , I generally think that we do n't  need to design in ems anymore . Its not worth the trouble . I would do it for a very simple layout but otherwise its too much of a pain to get layout precision with ems . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be nice to have a consistent specification on how the function is implemented across browsers . <p> Granted this is a hot debate that really is n't going to go away until the zoom bugs are fixed and IE6 disappears from view . <p> Now I do n't  know what type of clients and environments that all you guys work in . <p> But for me personally IE6 is still a major part of the equation . To the point that for the IE6 corporate audience alone I build sites with em in mind . <p> Yes in that corporate audience is the humble mid level manager with their laptop that they have to crank the browser font size up on to be able to read the text . Being a corporate environment the SOE is stuck on IE6 . Sad but true . Often this manager has the guiding say on their websites direction . <p> When this changes I will consider moving away . <p> BTW @JCroft I also do n't  design in ems to impress my webby mates . I doubt they even visit the sites I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the people with extreme accessibility issues can afford or know how to upgrade their browser . So until they replace that computer it is stuck on IE6 . <p> Now that 's not to say that moving away from a fluid layout is going to happen either . We must remember the iPhone is only a small percentage of the mobile web devices . <p> Now what would be good , and its just pie in the sky dreamin , but why not have the zoom function that allows for fluid boundary divs and restricts the zooming to the fluid layout . Hence no horizontal scrolling . Okay its years away , granted . <p> As very much an amateur in the web-site building arena I feel that it is important to check the pages work at various zoom levels . You would think that they would , after all , with the zoom you 'd think that all block elements would grow in proportion to each other . However I have found problems with IE 7 zoom where things which work at 100% start to go wrong at higher levels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have two things to be aware of . The effects of the older text resizing and those of the newer zoom . <p> I have to maintain a website which is used across 13 languages , so text-resizing is extremely important . Though the thrust of the post is aimed at people resizing text of a single language , it is also important to recognize the importance of designing for multiple languages ( for international sites which reuse the same look and feel ) . Its a basic L10n concept which will never go away , regardless of the browser . <p> Youve talked about zoom and text scaling , but there 's another purpose of having Ems as opposed to pixels - relative sizes for ease of maintenance ! You have n't mentioned this strong point . <p> If I want to increase/decrease font size of the main content section of a webpage ( because Marketing said so , or for some other reason ) then I can simply change the one property in CSS and every other element held inside the main content section will fall into line in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! ) <p> Using pixels is just too ideal and impractical in both from the maintenance and practical sense of the web browser technology today . <p> I still support the use of liquid-width layout design ( with min- &amp; max-width ) for the sake of being able to support both large and small window sizes . I do all my work on a Macbook with a 13 " screen , and when I ca n't plug into a larger monitor , I appreciate sites that fit within 800 pixels , especially since I rarely view any application at full-screen width . But its nice to know that with a larger screen , I get more screen real estate too . So a site that 's flexible still has good use . <p> I 'm all for the " we have no idea in what way , how or why someone uses the internet , or with what tool , so make it work properly anyway " school of thought . Think mobile browsers , internet goggles and Amazon Kindles , for all we know . <p> Timewise , on a big project @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot of the foundation work getting this sort of thing working , so time spent on it diminishes over time anyway . <p> I really do n't  understand why its considered such a big deal . I enlarge the text so that I can read long articles better . This allows me to simply scroll down the page and read . But if I use full-page zooming to make the text larger , it does n't  reflow within the visible window . Instead it spills over the edges and I 'm forced to scroll and left and right as well as up and down . <p> Um , quite conceivably I 'm completely missing the point here but px are relative to screen resolution whereas ems are relative to the default font the user has set . <p> What this means is that when I visit a site that defines fonts in pixels and the designer chose to use a 10px font , I am confronted with excruciatingly small text on my 2048x1536 21 " monitor . When I use the Foxs DOM Inspector to change that value to 1em , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instead of ems means that I and conceivably quite a lot of other people have to hit the zoom key at almost every site they visit . Not nice . Moreover , a webdesigner should *never* force the visitors of his page to dance to his tune . <p> Looks like were back where we were 10 years ago where graphic designers insisted on approaching web design as they did designing for dead tree media . But a computer monitor ! = a sheet of paper . <p> Matt May brings up the matter of screen resolution - the " normal " 96 DPI is by no means universal . IE and Opera display " medium " text at 20 pixels on my laptop , not 16 it has a factory setting of 120 DPI . <p> So zooming is only a partial solution . I think we still need to test layouts at different text sizes , regardless . <p> But from my experience with IE 7+8 , they do n't  fully zoom in on the page - somehow the rendering engine also scales the text but at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ text to jump around when zooming in . <p> Im reassured to see that I strongly disagree with Jeff Croft on this one : - ) <p> 20% of visitors to my site are using IE6 . I suspect that for most websites that are not focused on web development , and so attract a representative slice of all users , have a similar proportion of such visitors . <p> I 'm not going to screw up the potential working of my site for 20% of visitors when it is not difficult to do it properly and get it right . There 's NO good reason to deliberately do it wrong . <p> Jeff , you say that its too difficult to do the maths . That 's pathetic . First , you shouldnt be so worried about pixel precision , because it WONT hold for everyone . Second , you 're using a computer , even if you are n't  capable of multiplying 0.9 by 1.2 , your computer certainly is . <p> When IE6 still accounts for 25% of market share , allowing for text-resizing seems essential to me . <p> Zoom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it : Zooms advantages are aethestic no breaking , but horizontal scrolling possible in wide fixed-width sites . <p> Text-resizing is about functionality being legible , even if a container is overflowed or displaced in an inexpert application . It sometimes gets ugly , but its usable , and avoid the nightmare that Zoom can cause with vital page elements shifted off the screen . <p> Furthermore , I fully believe that cellphones will be used much more frequently for the Web in coming years . We need to be able to accomodate very small screen sizes . Zoom goes in only one directionlarger . <p> Do it *wrong* ? Please do n't  tell me the " size your text in ems " mantra is has been driven home so hard over the past few years that people now think that it is somehow *wrong* to size text absolutely ? Absolute units are every bit as valid as relative ones . The only thing that is *wrong* is IE6 . CSS does n't  give a damn what type of units you use . <p> The problem that I have with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just checked a page that I 'm working on ( in FF3 and Opera on the mac ) that has a fluid layout with a minimum width specified to prevent the page getting /too/ squished , and that minimum width gets scaled along with the page . So , at 200% zoom , my minimum width ( about 600 px ) suddenly produces scrollbars in any viewport smaller than 1200px , which according to my Mint statistics means that 87% of my visitors would get scrollbars at that zoom level . <p> Text-only zoom , on the other hand , will let the columns retain their width and although the line lengths can get a bit short after two or three text-size increases , the viewer with an average screen ( or smaller ) at least only has to scroll in one direction to read the text . <p> So I think that , as currently implemented , page zoom actually constitutes an extra gotcha that we need to watch out for ; a css parameter that assists the layout generally under the text-zoom regime causes problems in the page-zoom milieu @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not comparable to my job as a front-end developer/designer - 99% CMS stuff . <p> There is no such thing as even considering using ems here ( for font sizes ) . Each page is tailored as a compromise . Bespoke images can not be resized in ems ( especially if they are bumped by a resizing plugin from a CMS ) . Yes , I wish I could etc , but nope . <p> Besides , each site is aimed sharply at a niche of visitors , and both design , layout and implementation is plastered around a big heap of project work . What we sell these days is not design , its not usability , its not a portfolio site , its not black art - its the road leading to the site that our clients need . Its a project method - and it works very well . <p> Besides - I consider a web site a work in progress - something which is renewed every 1,5-3 years , or at least gets a major overhaul . By that time , so much has changed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ etcetera we scrap much of the front-end anyhoo . <p> CSS is a blessing , and continuing development in our field of work is too . I just wish the clients really got the Big Picture about how you can not possibly control the user experience like you can a printed object . So In a way , zoom is a gift to this Way of Work . <p> I recently publish one CSS Framework completely based on ems . I know that designing with ems can be nightmare for lot of you , but in the end is not all about page resizing.Its static v.s dynamic . Its is about writing better and more maintainable CSS code . <p> I wish people would stop propogating this little bit of cargo-cult CSS . Its true that , if you want a font size that is likely to be around about 10px on many browsers , you can set the text size to 62.5% . But you cant simply treat 1 em at 62.5% as equivalent to 10px . I 've seen , for instance , websites that specify a width of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and should fit on most screens . Except , of course , for a lot of users it is n't 1000px , so they end up with horizontal scrolling . <p> Designing as if you were using pixels , and then converting all your pixel measurements to ems using the 62.5% rule , fundamentally misunderstands the reason for using ems in the first place . <p> I say that the text scaling process has been placed there just for that websites that do n't  follow the basic rules for design . We should not worry about them . So my approach on " designing around scaling text " is obvious : ignore it . Focus on the most important things . And focus very hard on them . <p> In my 10 years experience on the web I used the scaling only 2-3 times , and it was on really bad designed web pages . <p> We have started using ems for our websites because if people need to enlarge text because of bad eyesight , then the text and graphics will enlarge proportionally instead of the text pushing the images @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Zoom " , an entry posted on 7 October , 2008 , to the 165 collection .

@@99593575 @3793575/ <p> I 'm a few months early for South by Southwest , but before we get to that : WestCiv builds the popular StyleMaster CSS Editor and publishes the House of Style . WestCiv is hosting a series of workshops on CSS layout in Sydney , Australia in a few weeks . The first has sold out , and the second only has a few seats left . Anyone looking to sharpen their CSS skills who will be in the area on December 12th may want to book a seat , like , now . It would seem that the Zen Garden will be a focus ; do n't  let that fool you , I 'm not taking a cut for plugging the workshop . WestCiv is a company that really gets it ; that 's worth supporting . <p> The beginning of next year is looking mighty interesting . What I can tell you for sure is that somehow , some way , I 'll be finding myself in Austin in March for SXSW Interactive . <p> The Zen Garden has been entered in the Awards as a developer resource , since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prizes . Should I hedge our bets and enter it as an Experimental site as well ? Perhaps an Art site ? I 've heard categorization of the awards has been a problem in the past ; trying to lump a large enough site into one category is no easy task . <p> And if you go to the panel grid , you 'll see a ton of panels it will be hard to choose from , and a very impressive roster of panelists running down the right . Somehow , some way , I 've managed to work myself onto that list ( which will update any time now ) , but I think I 'll leave precisely what and who I 'll be presenting with a surprise for now . Its going to be a good one , provided I 'm not completely overwhelmed by the amount of very cool people I 'll be meeting for the first time . <p> More coming as more develops .

I learnt alot and it could have easily been run over two days . I can highly recommend it for anyone who 's got the CSS basics down and who wants to take it further . Apparently John is looking to run similar worskhops in the US or Canada around January next year . So contact Westciv if you 're interested .

@@99593576 @3793576/ <p> I received an envelope in the mail the other day proclaiming that " Opening this envelope could change your life ! " I did what any rationalthinking person would do I threw it in the recycling bin unopened . <p> It got me thinking though . <p> How easily words so salacious bounce off of those living in the modern age . Without a moments consideration we outright reject them as typical marketing cruft . This is what advertisers are doing to us ; by continually bombarding us with messages designed to attract , stimulate , and captivate , we are becoming more and more desensitized to statements that should mean much more than the hollow , selfserving promises they do . <h> the job <p> Before Christmas , I worked on a job for a promotions company . While not technically a baitandswitch campaign since they did make available the product advertised , the focus was to obscure the real reason anyone would visit the site by aggressively promoting their other ( much more profitable ) offer . <p> The job disgusted me . Going against everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confuse and agitate people by luring them away from the goal of their visit . And as it turns out , I did a great job of it , too . The term " selling out " keeps rattling around inside my head , but I try to justify that , as an employee , I cant pick and choose my jobs . Somehow , the reasoning sounds a little forced . <p> Putting myself in a user role , I could envision doing two things if I came to a site like this one : I would rage at the flimsy marketing ploy and leave immediately , or I would persist and click on every damn thing until I found the product I originally intended on getting . Maybe I 'm even in the majority , but it only takes a small percentage of sidetracked users buying the " upgraded " product to flag a campaign like this a complete success . <h> doing it right <p> The tactics Ive mentioned are the stuff of a marketers dream ; they serve their own needs beautifully , but the person winding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feeling confused , numb , and maybe even cheated when they realize the reality delivered turns out to be far less enriching than what they were promised . <p> If only companies would try spending a fraction of the time and money used in promoting their product to make it better ; we might start seeing some radical change in core business philsophy . If products were released that served an actual consumer need , instead of a companys own need for more income , they might be surprised at how well they sell with little or no help on their own part . <p> Look at Googles example two guys started a company with the basic idea that they would n't " be evil " . They built the better mousetrap , and quickly became a ) popular and b ) profitable . Resisting the urge to sell out that many companies succumb to , they have succeeded far beyond what anyone could have originally imagined after first seeing their spartan , unadorned site . Simply because they 're useful , relevant , and look after their users needs as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and build it well , you do n't  need to spend half your income promoting your product . If people have a reason to buy it , and keep buying it , you will succeed . <h> service is where its at <p> Service over self : its a simple , quaint little philosophy that hearkens back to the day of the General Store clerk . Somehow in the haze of advertising , branding , and all the other -ings that get their own department in a modern company , we seem to have forgotten about it . <p> But apply it to todays business climate ? Funny enough , that might just work . 
@@99593578 @3793578/ <p> Fantastic new business model : start a company , but do n't  bother producing anything . This is the Age of the Lawsuit ! Acquire another companys intellectual property and sue the pants off of anyone else using code that even faintly smells of your new patents . <p> In a lawsuit strikingly reminiscent to the current SCO flap , the JPEG image format is under attack by a 300-person strong scheduling software developer ( not that suitability or appropriateness would ever come into play in a patent dispute ) . <p> Forgent Networks of Austin , TX announced it was suing 31 major hardware and software vendors , including the likes of Canon , Apple , Adobe and HP . Mentioned in the article but not underlined in big red letters is the fact that since they 've started licensing this patent in 2002 , over 30 companies have deemed it enough of a threat to pony up a combined $90 million . <p> Of course , this is n't the first time a popular image format has come under fire . The GIF format was built on top @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never actually take advantage of that for profit , and naturally went back on their word when it looked like they needed the money . <p> What does this new dispute mean for us , the users and consumers of JPEG ? Its too early to say . If the large companies named in the lawsuit pony up a settlement , what 's to stop Forgent from coming after individual users with a new-money afterglow ? If the large companies named in the lawsuit fight it and win , what 's to stop Forgent from coming after individual users in embittered retaliation ? There are a lot of variables here which can go in many different ways , so the only sure thing is that this is one to watch . <p> Update : " They cant go after the users " seems to be a common refrain in response to this post . Time for a mini history lesson : Unisys , the former owner of the GIF patent , did in fact take steps to outline a licensing fee for individual users . Granted , those creating GIFs with software @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point remains it can filter down to users . Never say never . 30454 @qwx890454 <p> I do n't  honestly think these guys can win . The format was already in use before they got the patent , and I forget what the wording is exactly , but there is something in US patent law that one can not patent an already present idea . So , for example , one can not patent the concept of a chair and then sue everyone who makes and uses chairs . <p> And suing individual users ? Cmon , that 's ridiculous . Maybe huge web design firms , but only if they win the first suit against the companies . <p> This weasel companys claim will be squased in a year or two and no one will notice . Nature abhors a weasel . <p> And like SCO , they wont win . Nor will they come after individuals , unless they want to sue every computer user in the world . They are aiming their lawyer cannons at the money targets Adobe , Apple , et al . <p> Hooray for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all designs , except where I need 1-bit transparency that just works . <p> Perhaps not , but the $90 million in licensing fees theyve collected so far goes some way toward proving there 's something to their suit . Sony does n't  hand out $16 million to just any company that comes along and asks for it . <p> This does n't  hold much water . Forgents had the IP for 7+ years , and only recently started seeking licensing fees . They pretty much already shot themselves in the foot . However , it might bring about another , better , format . <p> If anything , this should be reason enough to make PNG the de facto standard image format in web sites and applications . And yeah , that includes IE , the one and only browser that is holding back a widespread use of PNG . <p> I do n't  see what all the fuss is about . The patent was originally granted by USPTO on Oct. 6 , 1987 . As such , it expires October 6 , 2004 . Forgent is making a last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ companies before the patent expires . They wo n't have time to sue end users before October , and suing end users is silly because they have no money . : - ) <p> At best , they could get a settlement for past infringement from the companies in the lawsuit , and such a settlement would preclude them form suing individual users for past infringement . If you also consider that they have not acted in a timely manner to defend their patent as required by US law , you can understand why all the companies in the lawsuit laughed at them . <p> This is a good example of why the USPTO needs to seriously reconsider this bizarre habit of allowing mathematical algortihms to be patented . <p> Congrats to Forgents public relations department , though . A single press release can do so much for the company profile : - ) <p> There is no point in discussing whether it is the 17 yr or 20 yr rule . If a court says their patent rights have been infringed , folks have to pay up . Yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Dave : Patent laws and licensing fees are the next realm in software . The discussion in my Adelaide LUG recently focussed on this . The driving force in software development still remains " what can be patented " , and as " broadly " as possible . This was the speakers own experience . <p> The goal of these patents remains dual : licensing , and protecting self from lawsuits . <p> Firstly IBM comes into mind . No other tech company has more patents granted each year than Big Blue . Some figures estimate that IBM reaps licensing fees to the tune of $1 billion US per annum on its patents ! <p> Secondly , patents are used in a specific case when another firm is threatning to sue . So you just show them your patents they are infringing . Nice little agreement , case closed . <p> All of this was nice and good until the quite recent adventurism of these small players to hit the motherlode . Burst , SCO and now Forgent come to mind . <p> Legal costs will surely preclude end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big names Apple , Adobe to cough up the cash . But surely this does n't  mean they will not come after end users . if nothing else works for them , they will come . Its just the nature of the beast . <p> Yeah , Sunny . I belive I wrote " At best , they could get a settlement for past infringement from the companies in the lawsuit , and such a settlement would preclude them form suing individual users for past infringement . " <p> You could at least read my post in its entirety before dismissing me . Sheesh . <p> " They cant go after the users " is a common refrain because it is legally correct . The Internet is full of commentators who do n't  understand the difference between using and distributing . <p> Legally , copyrights and patents have no application to use , they apply to distribution . You buy something , you can use it , period . If a vendor did n't  dot all their is in selling you ( or giving you ) a product , that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after software companies implementing JPEG compression , because Forgent a patent . Its stupid , but legally possible . However , the end user *by definition* is not writing infringing software , and thus the end user is not violating any patents . Simple , huh ? <p> People who point to the RIAA as a litigator of end-users forget that this is n't the case . The RIAA is only going after people who *distribute* music , not those who download or listen to music . <p> That 's why the SCO debacle is such a farce . Darl is trying to argue that they can go after end users because " all Linux end-users also distribute Linux " or something ridiculous to that effect . It would never stand up in court , and they know it , which is why they have n't ( and wont ) sue any end users for copyright infringement . Instead , they 're pursuing purely contract cases ( like the Autozone case ) . <p> Bardas : I was making a general statement regarding this issue . Many may feel that since the patent lapses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That is certainly not the case . I am sorry for not acknowledging your point . I apologize if my words have led you to believe otherwise . It was not my intention to dismiss you . <p> I will concur with Dave in saying that this is not at all laughable . This company has secured $90 million US in licensing including Sony . None of these companies fork out that sort of cash for nothing . <p> Like you , I find it unlikely that end users will be sued , but its not entirely implausible . As I said , it could be a last ditch effort . <p> Of course you are right about the need of reform in this process . I think USPTO should take heed from their British counterparts who are very lukewarm/apprehensive about software patents . I doubt if anything will change at all . Like I mentioned in my earlier comment , patents are just the way of doing business in todays world . <p> The first rule of law is do n't  sue folks with no money ( if that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you 're inclined to judicial contest ) . So , other factors aside , individuals are mostly safe by virtue of the fact that they do n't  produce enough nectar to justify a run through the juicer . <p> " Right . So why did the RIAA sue individuals ? " <p> Cuz it was cheap press . but a risky move by a formerly **32;2162;TOOLONG industry confused and desperate to do *something* in the face of a systemic technological/cultural shift . Different scenario entirely . <p> " So individuals are safe ? " <p> Yeah . Sleep tight , Billy . Nobody is going to sue Grandpa for playing with the images off his new digital photo kamera.

Structural description is more than enough for most content documents around , and documents which require semantic description are more storage / database style files than content . <p> Ive bene thinknig of applying the new Skip navigation method recently discovered as a pseudo FIR replacement .

CSS enabled browsers that have images off can be catered to by putting the same information in the image ? s title attribute . This way it is possible to accommodate all users . <p> If were going to move toward semantic markup , there needs to be something that provides semantics . I have two more questions without answers , though : do we really need to move toward semantic markup ? And if so , is it enough to have a human- ( but not machine- ) readable profile that defines the semantics ? That 's what HTML provided , and it seemed to work well enough . Everyone knew what the p element meant , even if they did n't  use it . <p> Re . Semantic markup - good questions ( I 've added a link to your post on the ESW Wiki , maybe someone will take note ) . <p> Personally I 'd lean towards Lachs suggestion of separate languages for structure/meaning , but these certainly do n't  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ +CSS ) + RDF would I believe be a good choice .

@@99593581 @3793581/ <p> When coding larger sites , the CSS cascade is both friend and foe . The choice is yours : redundancy , or dependency ? <p> CSS forces you to make a choice in your coding techniques , a choice that becomes more obvious the larger a site grows . As the amount of variance between different templates increases , you can go in one of two directions : you can either code for redundancy , or code for dependency . <p> I 'll give you some examples to illustrate what I 'm talking about . First , redundancy . Youve just created a series of forms across three pages . Each form has a couple of fields in common with the other forms , that you 'd like to present in a similar way . The redundant method of coding each is to copy and paste the CSS , changing only the selector . For example : <p> In the interest of code optimization , it can be even further condensed of course . You can style #loginForm generically , no matter what its parent might be : <p> #loginForm margin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what 's happening here is that there 's an assumption driving the coding decision : all instances of #loginForm should have a 5 pixel margin , and be coloured dark grey . What if the form on the sites entry page needs a slightly different margin to adjust for other surrounding elements ? Youd have to rely on the cascade to pick up the initial styling , then call it out separately : <p> At this point , the instance of #loginForm showing up on . entrypage is picking up the color value from the previous style rule , and now were moving firmly into the territory of the previously mentioned dependency . The second rule is relying on part of the styling of the first , so if you remove or modify the first , you change the formatting of the element in question . <p> Its relatively easy to see what 's happening at a glance : first , your #loginForm is generically styled . Second , the generic style is overridden with a followup rule in certain instances . Easy . <p> But it gets more difficult if there 's , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up from a new style rule . Not to mention the difficulty added if part of the styling shows up quite a bit further down in the style sheet from the initial rule , or even in a new style sheet altogether . And if you 're handing your CSS over to a client who has n't  quite grasped the concept of the cascade , they wont be able to make heads or tales of the dependencies . <p> To take it to an extreme , what if eight different style rules form the basis of the final style which eventually gets rendered on-screen , and changing any one of those prior rules might affect the element in question , but ripple across the site and change other elements unintentionally ? <p> Let 's analyze this a little more closely , since its so important to understand . Say you 've got the following rules combining to create the style for #loginForm on the sites entry page , as above : <p> The final styling for the instance of #loginForm in question would then be : a margin of 5 pixels , dark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 5 pixels of padding on all sides except the left , which gets no padding . So now you want to go back and change the font size to match your body text , what do you do ? The natural inclination is to modify the second line : <p> . sidebar #loginForm padding : 5px ; font-size : 1em ; <p> Except oh no wait , other elements were picking up the style from that particular rule and you just changed the font size for all occurances of #loginForm that sit inside the sites sidebar , and you did n't  want to do that . You 're making the font size adjustment six months later though , so you do n't  even remember the dependency . And chances are you wo n't notice it immediately since you 're not liable to refresh pages other than the one you 're currently working on , so you just gave yourself an extra few minutes of debugging for whenever you actually spot the difference . <p> The easy fix , of course , is to just not modify the more general style rule and add a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> . entrypage . sidebar #loginForm padding-left : 0px ; font-size : 1em ; <p> And if you follow that line of reasoning to its logical end , you 're back in the redundancy camp : <p> So it turns out there 's a spectrum ; you can move in either direction , in varying degrees . More dependencies make for a sticky and tangled mess of logic that creates extra work when you come back to modify your creation . More redundancies are verbose and bandwidth intensive , and create extra work for the initial creation process . <p> I tend to favour redundancy in theory , but I code in plenty of dependencies in practice . Redundancy is easier to understand , cheap enough when the CSS is being cached properly , but inconvenient to build . Dependencies are far easier to create when coding , but during browser testing and later modifications to the style they cause no end of headaches . And when I 'm working on a CSS file that I know will have to be understood by someone else , there 's all the more reason to keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CSS in sections , a section per page-type , I 've never encountered this problem . Its redundant its not optimised for download speed , its optimised for easy reading and editing . <p> I suppose one could have develop ones CSS in stages . There would be a development stage , where the CSS is optimised for easy reading and editing . These CSS files would be the reference CSS files any future edits are done to them , and them alone . <p> Before the CSS files go live , they are passed through a CSS optimiser . This could be automatic ( then checked ) , or it could be entirely manual . If you 're doing it manually , you could use as much dependencies as you liked , so long as the rendering matched the master CSS for each page-type . <p> A few people have mentioned applying custom ids to the body element and tapping into page-specific style that way . Its a good idea , but no real fix for the problem . <p> Go back to the examples in the article and assume each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ class . So " . checkout #loginForm " becomes " #checkout #loginForm " since the body is given an i 'd of " checkout " . <p> The problem is n't solved by that alone . In fact , that 's not doing anything differently than the listed example from the article there 's a specific parent , and a generic child that may be pulling its style from a few different rules ( that either involve the parent or do n't  . ) <p> You still run into dependencies if you 're not careful , because doing this is quite easy too : <p> . form padding : 5px ; #homepage . form color : blue ; <p> See ? <p> I think Eris has hit on something wise though , the idea that base style elements are okay being dependent , and redundancy can be applied to page-by-page styling . <p> In principle its the same as having page-specific external style sheets that contain extra , non-base styling for each page , you just have the option of centralizing all your style in one sheet . That makes a lot of sense to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coding for myself because it seems to make more sense to me from a logical point of view . But dependency can seem a little messy when its not your creation and without comments . So when I 'm coding for someone else , redundancy is appropriated since its easier to understand . <p> I definitely favor dependency , though the inheritance problem can be a pain ( Firefoxs Web Developer Toolbar helps ease that pain ) . One thing I 've started to move to is applying multiple classes to an element . <p> I 'm glad someone else mentioned OOP already , so I do n't  sound completely nuts . I 've started to think of classes as classes in an OOP language . They describe a set of common characteristics . An i 'd is like an instantiation of the class , where your Person object gets its own name , age , whatever ( e.g. , this instance of the form overrides its shared border color because of an i 'd ) . <p> The only trick is breaking the common characteristics into sensible classes so they can be applied together without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do that ; I suppose the order of the class names would control which class wins out . <p> If I 'm coding a project for me an no one else , I have a tendency to be redundant , more than dependent . As you said , it seems to make browser testing and final tweaks go much more smoothly . <p> Of course , it drives my boss nuts because he s a stickler for code-optimization . So , in practice , I often end up being redundant , and then going back at the end of the project and optimizing the code , often building in dependancies . <p> I hate to bandy semantics on a post that has some very good points , but what you 're discussing is not , repeat NOT , inheritance . Its the cascade . <p> Inheritance is the mechanism by which values are passed from an element to its children , and from them to their children , and so on . Period . <p> When two rules apply to an element , and there are conflicting declarations in those rules @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cascade at work . ( The foundation of making that particular choice is specificity . ) <p> I 'm relatively new to the whole CSS thing , but even just in coding my homepage and a simple recipe db , I 've already run into this dilemma . <p> Ultimately , the more everything can match to common templates , the better . A login form is really just a general form with some differences . So style forms with the consistent attributes such as colour , and then add a single layer of redundent rules later that override where necessary . <p> Or maybe maximum two : One that overrides the " . form " rules for " . form . login " , and then any final tweaks can be applied via the i 'd , so you 've got the second dependent layer styled as " . form #loginsidebar " . It means you wrap two divs around around your form , but I do n't  think that 's the end of the world . <p> I tend to favor dependency over redundancy , it seems to make more sense to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mention optimization . That could be the object-oriented , computer science part of me talking though . <p> I tend to put my basic form styling in the main stylesheet , then if I need to customize a particular page in any further way I would give the page body an I 'd , then drive rules to that page with selectors . Kinda like your example above , except with IDs instead of classes . <p> Why would a particular page have a custom class ( as in your examples ) instead of an I 'd anyway ? <p> One thing dependency does is force you to document your project a little better . If you have styles which will change all sorts of things throughout the site , you **25;2196;TOOLONG document every single dependency to avoid changing things unexpectedly . This is especially important if you are passing the site off to either the client or another firm . Without documentation , things can get bad quickly . <p> I mostly tend to favour redundancy over dependency . I tend to ask myself a couple of questions while working on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the future ? Is this style related to another style ? <p> If its open for changes , I try to build it in a redundant way first . After a couple of revisions for that particular section and I have come to the point of finalizing it , I 'll look if I can optimize it . <p> If its related to another style , dependency might be my choice . If it is n't , I favour redundancy no matter what . Often cases like these are only a small bit of the stylesheet , so , initially , to make my life a whole lot less of a hassle , I 'll write a bit more than really needed . <p> I 've always considered relying on dependency too much as creating a CSS class for 5px padding , 10px padding and 20px along with similar classes for margin . Sure , you could then refer a wide range of classes , but think about it for a second . Are you sure you 're not destroying the flexibility CSS initially gives you ? Are you sure a single change somewhere does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those questions while working on something and with every case the answer could be different . For me personally , the answers are mostly in favour of redundancy . <p> Thanks for the post Dave . I wrestle with this every time I am writing css . I often find myself looking at a stylesheet I had written and thinking that it could be a lot cleaner and more efficient but opting not to touch it in order to preserve future understanding of what I had written . That , and secretely thinking : " I hope no one ends up looking at this stylesheet " . <p> I am a pretty big proponent of comments , though more for myself than other people , which can be extremely helpful when I foresee a sticky situation in the future or something tricky intially that might leave my head when the time comes to look at it again . <p> But again , thanks . I cant really speak for the rest of the readers out there , but I value posts like this a lot . It is reassuring to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like this which could be percieved as having a simple , but unknown , solution . <p> Its funny how much you hit the nail on the head with this post Dave ! I am currently involved in a coding project that revolved around achieving such a balance between both . <p> Having encountered this CSS dilemma in the past , especially the client confusion part , we decided to plan how this project would layout exactly , from the get-go . We storyboarded the flow of the entire site , and everywhere where an element would go we brainstormed the most effective ( and semantic ) use of its being marked up and styled . Div blocks were cut out of the Photoshop comps and were logically named . Unordered lists , it was decided , would only be used in the footer , for example . Paragraph tags would only occur within #content div , etc . Nothing was left out of consderation . <p> Coming to the end of this project now , I realize that this painstaking planning up front with consistent naming , logical IDing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bloat , greatly improved the reliance of the cascade , and has allowed for a more logical editing for future maintenance . In other words , our client will not have to have a Zen Garden submission to know how to manage their CSS file . <p> For most , this amount of precious time spent planning like this would not be conducive for a clients budget . However , when you really take the time up front to make these hard choices , it really makes everything run much smoother in the end . Unfortunately , it is all too easy to just jump right in , hit the ground running with your design , and find yourself and your design breaking every time you touch your CSS file . <p> Some very good points you 've made . I 've grappled with the same issues and usually end up taking the redundant approach . Even if I attempt to start out creating appropriate dependencies it seems that there 's always that exception where you need to override a specific attribute . <p> When creating dependencies I try to make things easier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you group your h1 , h2 , h3 and other block level element styles together and then all of your #sidebar styles together , where do you override the h2 for your #sidebar ? <p> Either way you 're well on your way to that tangled mess you spoke of . Personally , I prefer to take care in creating clean , lightweight CSS so that if its necessary to have some redundancy for the sake of clarity I 'm not taking a huge bandwidth hit . <p> The exact same issue is present in object oriented programming too . In OO , though , there 's no choice its all for dependency , but in the idea of a proper architecture . I 'd say , the same can apply here a proper inheritance structure should be able to " take it " . <p> The more I experiment and code , I 've found myself taking a hybrid approach with this . On most of my base style , itd dependancy and with elements that are page or object specific , its redundancy . It works for me because there 's less of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whereas my specifics seem to be in a constant state of alteration . <p> Good article - I just came off a huge project that was my first experience with this really becoming an issue . The forms of the site were all built in a Java/XML pipeline and I really had very little control over classing and IDs . <p> To make it worse , I had to start styling the site before I was too aware of exactly what the scope was . <p> 3/4 of the way through I ended up removing a lot of redundancies and exchanging them for dependencies as the CSS files got too huge and started to bug out Internet Explorer . <p> The moral of the story is : Know your scope ; planning your selectors in advance gives you a huge advantage later , much like the OO programmer who uses UML to figure out his classes . <p> Everyone has his own practices , here 's mine if you care if the CSS is surely going to be re-worked later by me or the colleague , i cascade selectors from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i found that DOM-like approach and extensive commenting ( which includes something like /* IE this is for you : ) */ ) make things a lot easier . <p> Take the time to read how a compressor works and youll understand why gzip will remove redundancy . That 's what every lossless compressor does . <p> By the way , I have never said you can develop bloated code and be forgiven for that thanks to gzip . I just say many times optimizing code to have a small size takes so much time and its soooo messy when debugging it does not pay the pain or the bandwidth . <p> a really good topic here , and you explained everything very plainly , Dave -thanks <p> for me , dependency is the thing about CSS that has been the hardest to grasp I usually tend to err on the side of redundancy , but I always have this feeling that there 's a more efficient way to do it <p> Dave , you are describing exactly the problem I am facing these days . In the past I had always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But now I am doing a large Website and code the CSS for a CMS-application . So now all the parts of the website have to be a small universe for themself . Having coded now for years with the cascade and inheriting code ( to write leaner CSS-files ) I now face a different kind of coding where I prefer to put an extra DIV around a chunk of text . In the days before I would n't , but then I had the control . <p> So , having said that , I think both ways of coding are correct , it simply depends on the complexity of the application . <p> Code with redundancy is almost always easier to implement and debug , so the only point for dependency would be size . <p> Say your CSS stylesheet with plenty of dependencies would be 5 KB . Now , how much would it be if you favour redundancy ? 6 KB ? 7 KB ? Nowadays most of the people have at least a 56Kbps connection or broadband , so 1 or 2 KB more is almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just a second more ! <p> I tend toward combining classes for when you need to alter genericly styled elements . <p> As an example , if you want a form button to trail the form element , ( such as on a single line form ) , adding the class " trail " to its existing class can alter it enough without building up complex dependancies and associated problems . <p> This also works well when you need a longer form element , such as for a URL/email address . Why create a complex inheritance when you can combine tmodify the existing one with a new class , " long " to achieve the same ? <p> ( You can use more than one class within an element by seperating them by a space ) . <p> In some cases , multiple classes could be used to decouple one set of characteristics from another . For example , one page on your web site ( or one section within a page ) might feature a different colour scheme than another . You could introduce two classes to define the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appropriate in each case . <p> This will only work , however , in cases where the set of properties you need to switch between are truly independent of all the other properties . <p> In regards to Pau Garcias comment , bandwidth concerns are a reality , not a relic from the olden days . A high traffic site sees hundreds of thousands of visitors a month ( probably more ) . When you take a small amount of savings in file size and multiply that by the number of monthy visitors you 're suddenly talking about gigabytes of data consuming bandwidth when it could be conserved . <p> Bandwidth concerns are not solved by enabling gzip compression . Sure it helps greatly , but to think that you can make bloated HTML , CSS , Javascript , etc .. just because of gzip is quite short-sighted . Maybe in personal web environments where bandwidth is n't of great concern , due to low volume of traffic , you can create comment rich CSS and nicely formatted Javascript . In professional web applications *everything* should be optimized as much as possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ = high stress for the web developer <p> File optimization certainly is one place where I can reduce monthly bandwidth usage ( lower cost for business ) and decrease download times . I do n't  see the arguement against such methodology . <p> " because gzip compression will remove redundancy ) " <p> Possibly you are confused as to what either gzip does or what this topic was originally about , but gzip compression will not alter your CSS file in anyway . Enabling gzip does not magically remove your redundant rules . <p> I 've had the unfortunate experience of writign some pretty nasty CSS and its come from this very problem . It definately is a dilemma if you do n't  really put a lot of thought into the initial design of both the site layout and the structure of the CSS . <p> Dependency really floats my boat for the most part . Oddly , I find it easier to edit when everythings dependent on a master set of styles . It makes more sense in the end if you *know* what changes everything , and what changes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CSS requires you to edit specific rules every time you want to change what should be a master rule , kind of defeating the purpose of the cascade , which the way I see it is to allow you to modify only what must be modified and let previous rules handle the rest . Generally ease in debugging follows logical coding . The only difficulty with Dependency is when you cant find what rules are already applied ; but then it helps to have tools like " View Style Information " on the Web Developer Toolbar for Firefox . Besides , when part of your CSS is generated from Perl and you modify things far away from your XHTML files its not easy to be redundant if you wanted to .

Others develop proprietary code that works only in a handful of popular browsers . <p> Thus one of WaSPs primary goals is to provide educational resources that can help our peers learn standards-compliant methods that are in their interest and that of their clients and site users . <p> WaSP was originally founded in 1998 to encourage browser makers to use and promote core web standards ; by the year 2001 it had become emminently clear that they had met their goal . The problem WaSP addresses today is developers coding for the browsers of yesterday , through habit or ignorance . <p> Todays WaSP exists to inform @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use what 's at their disposal , to create a better web for us all . Its an exciting time , and a great group of people . I 'm proud to be a part of this . <p> Congratulations Dave ! I used to be one of those developers . Unaware of standards and still treating tables like the swiss army knife of web development , until I saw the CSS Zen Garden . It opened up a whole new perspective for me ( " mmhh perhaps this CSS thing is worth looking into after all " ) . <p> Here is a WaSP suggestion : how about a recommendation to mellow out on the over abuse of the acronym tag ? <p> The only pages that really use them are produced for fellow " web designers " . And its not like we do n't  know what XHTML , CSS etc stands for . If I really needed to find out , I would google . Plus , it adds to the page file size . <p> Or am I completely out of line here and is there something I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acronym tags ? <p> Huphtur , yes . Screen readers can use the acronym tags , but you 're right to think they are being abused . The recommednations say to expand abbreviations the first time they occur in a page , not every time they occur . Using each once on a page would count as " mellowing out " to me . <p> Then again , with a CMS like Movable Type , sometimes the abbreviations could be in multiple posts on the same page ( homepage ) , but necessary because the posts have individual pages where each abbreviation expansion would be unique . <p> Sergio - glad the Zen Garden has had that effect . I have a few ideas in mind I 'll have to formulate over the next few days . I 'm considering a WaSP asks the W3C on a particularly thorny issue . Nothing like stirring up the pot the first week on the job ! <p> Its tempting to think that everyone who reads a geek site like this has the same knowledge level as you ; but its wrong . People of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . I cant make assumptions about who knows what , because most of the time I 'd be wrong . <p> When I cruise the sites of prominent coders , for example , I frequently get trapped in acronym hell . Luckily some are considerate enough to provide titles . It really helps . <p> James - the spec does say that , but I 'm not entirely convinced its abuse if you expand every one . Nevertheless , this site only expands the first instance of an initialism/acronym in a piece of text ; each comment expands individually , as does each post . But they only expand one definition per . I think this is just a limit of Movable Type , or at the very least , my filters . <p> Congratulations Dave ! I 'm really happy for you , and happy for the community as a whole . So many people have benefited from the work you 've done , and will continue to do so . Thanks for setting a great example <p> As far as the acronym thing goes , I think you bring up a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , etc. that read your site and others and frankly I think all too often Web standards are perceived as some sort of special club that you have to have reached a certain level of know-how to belong to . <p> We need to keep in mind that there are lots and lots of folks out there who very little to no experience with Web standards . There needs to be an effort to communicate with those people in such a way that they feel included and get them excited about standards . Things like acronyms can help . <p> I 'm not too sure if it will really help the newbie : Will they understand what CSS is when it says " Cascading Style Sheets " ? It still does n't  explain what it really is . Plus a newbie might be confused by a " link that does n't  work " . <p> ( Sorry to take your WaSP festivities off topic here Dave , congrats on that ! ) <p> One last poke at the topic then , and well let it rest - the point of expanding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not what it means . <p> Imagine if you had to wrap a more contextual layer around " Cascading Style Sheets " every time you used it in its entirety that explains what they are with links to the spec and other appropriate documentation . Perhaps software should be built that does this ( MS Smart Tags anyone ? ) but the document author should n't be on the hook for every one . <p> So why are authors on the hook for abbreviations ? Shouldnt software just take care of that ? Arguably yes , but initialisms/acronyms can be ambiguous . Does CSS mean " Cascading Style Sheets " , is it a reference to the DVD encoding scheme that DeCSS obliterated a few years ago , or is it The College of St. Scholastica in Minnesota ? <p> But any further discussion should probably be taken to the appropriate W3 mailing list .

@@99593583 @3793583/ <p> At some point in the past few months I had considered writing up how you 'd go about saving out icons in multiple file formats .

While vector is ideal and keeps things at their same proportions , some colors and lines that would look nice , crisp and attractive at one size may look horrible scaled down or up . Sometimes you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depending on the scale . <p> If its only 1 icon in a year and only for 1 platform , then there are much cheaper and easier tools that will do the job and give you a satisfactory result . As a professional , you have no choice , this is the one , the only one . <p> I found that with this process , IconBuilder Pro makes importing files and creating icons a breeze . One of the key features of OS X icons is their ability to scale smoothly at any size . I like that IconBuilder provides specific settings and tools that take the drudgery out of the process of applying scalability , transparency , and shadow features to newly created icons . Although you need at least a basic knowledge of Photoshop to take advantage of all the settings and tools , I like that IconBuilder does come with well-written tutorials and a user manual that clearly explains the operations . Overall , users who are well versed in Photoshop and who wish to create Mac OS X icons should definitely check out this program @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for my mac all of the time . when i set the plug in for making xp compatable icon files ( with a . ico file name ) it will export a file , but when i copy it over to my xp machine it looks correct in Icon view in an explorer window , but if i put it on the desktop ithe icon gets cropped ( always from the top right if that means anything ) , anyone can help me ? <p> Have you tried combining the multi-layers ( icon psds ) into a Smart Object layer and align them with the IconBuilders grid ? Then , you can turn on/off individual smart object layer to export various sizes with IconBuilder or you can use Photoshop CS3s Script &gt; Export Layers to Files . <p> IconBuilder Pro is the easiest tool to learn because the examples and tutorials are top notch . And while I realize that not everyone has experience with Photoshop , it is pretty much the defacto standard for graphics applications . <p> Um , I realize this thread might be fairly dead , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vector or not post above <p> I think that it is time to start thinking vector whether you like the quality of it or not . Pixel graphics are not going to easily translate onto high dpi displays seems like no big deal now , but vector svg is there for the using so my personal process is to do the primary icon design as a vector . adding a SVG variant to the ico bundle would be clutch. 30455 @qwx890455 30451 @qwx890451 <p> You are reading " IconBuilder " , an entry posted on 30 August , 2007 , to the Ancient collection .

@@99593584 @3793584/ <p> Something I 've been thinking about lately is the idea of localized web sites , or sites restricted to a smaller audience by either content matter or technological barriers . Having a global audience is great for meeting new people and being exposed to ideas and mindsets one may not have been aware of , but sometimes that 's too much exposure . <p> For example , as more members of my family slowly become wired , the idea of having a common , family-only place for us all to go and talk and post pictures seems like the next logical step beyond email . I 'd actually prefer that to email , given shared common archives and search options , but it might be a barrier for other members of the family who are n't  as comfortable with technology . <p> So its been interesting watching details emerge about Project Comet , a new product from Six Apart . Its looking as if it might just be exactly what I think our family needs , with features like photo sharing , media lists , and private weblogs . What I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and how they plan on making it accessible and user-friendly to people who are n't  technically proficient . <p> Also picking up in my neck of the woods are community-oriented sites and weblogs . Locally focused sites with content only relevant to people within a certain geographic region are a niche that has n't  traditionally been done well on the internet . It seems to me that when you have a company driving the local content creation , there has to be a return in order to justify the resources , so you end up with company directory after company directory , maybe some events listings , a bit of weather , and not much else . Craigslist is a notable exception which has been expanding like crazy , but unless you live in one of the earlier cities it added , its not quite there yet . ( Although it was good enough to find us a new place to live last time around , replacing the for-pay listing service I 'd used prior . ) <p> But in the hands of passionate individuals who simply want to share their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a totally different experience . I 've enjoyed watching new local content launch at an increasing pace , mostly in the form of weblogs thus far . <p> Long-running local favourite VanEats is written by enthusiastic technologist and food critique Roland Tanglao , a name some might recognize from the Bryght team . Also run by the same folks is UrbanVancouver , a sort of local news aggregator pulling from numerous sources around town . ( Disclosure : I had a hand in the design a few years back . ) Local duo Ianiv and Arieanna run Vancouver Coffee , a subject close to my heart . Neighbourhood-specific blogs kitsilano.ca and Beyond Robson just kicked off this spring , and even the local businesses are getting into the spirit : check out the amount of detail and obvious love for the location that has gone into this site for a relatively small commercial corner of the city at Macdonald and Fourth . The streetscape photo tours are similar to a feature amazon.com launched a while ago , but never found its way north of the border ; I wish all commercial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hmmmm , the local Web . That would make for a cool Web 2.0 mash-up . Use Google Maps to index community focused Web sites , add a dash of folksonomy and you could overlay an information terrain over a physical space . It would be an interesting exercise to organize these sites into islands of information - especially , once they get the kinks out , if you add wireless devises to the mix . <p> Youve described a big part of why LiveJournal is so popular . Users can set a post to be visible to only to friends , or even sub-sets of friends ( a family set , for example ) . Add to that a simple aggregator ( the LJ friends list ) and its a very simple , useful thing . I hope they incorporated something like into Project Comet . <p> " especially , once they get the kinks out , if you add wireless devises to the mix " <p> Oh yeah . Ive been saying for a while I 'd drop a good bundle on any wireless device that let 's me use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ browser . When I 'm street-level , I really wish look up what 's around the corner . <p> And you 're thinking along the right lines about extending it toward community-focused web sites . How great would it be to have a wiki layer on Google Maps ? ( Assuming its done right , and there 's continual editing effort might be better to just start geotagging Wikipedia articles and not duplicate that effort . ) <p> Funny you mention the family bit . I just got back from a family wedding and it occurred to me that there is no place online for all the folks in the Mendoza family to all hook up . In that case I felt responsible to give us an online presense and quickly buy our family name before it gets snatched up in the future . <p> Thanks for the tip on sixApart , I did n't  realize they were starting up something just like it with their project comet . Ill have to check it out since the last thing I 'd want to do is put a lot of time and effort into something that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conceivable that we would n't even need to add geo information maunally to a wiki or site . It would n't be that hard for Google to index a blogs location by its content . If its community based , a sites content will be riddled with location based information - addresses , landmark &amp; business names , events , etc . Using this information Google should be able to use its mapping technology to triangulate , map and record the radius of the contents physical reach . It would allow you to see how concentrated or diluted a blogs community based content really is , or how wide or small its physical scope is . This would be really great for indexing - and imagine if you could compare different communities using this information - excellent for planning vacations and family moves . <p> The web has always held the promise of bringing us closer and I think its finally starting to work . I use flickr ( www.flickr.com ) to post personal photos and comments back and forth with my family . It does more for us than email ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but everyone understands a photo . <p> BTW , Thanks for mentioning the site I work on ( MacFourth.com ) with such a nice description . I 'm glad that my enthusiasm for the area comes across . <p> I have been thinking about something similar , but from the other direction ; i.e. I have assumed that family content is inevitable and considered the effect that has on the ever decreasing pool of domain names . <p> I am by no means an expert on this ; however , I am sure at some point there will be a need for more than one www.smith.family , or family.singh.london , or any other method of addressing . <p> If this kind of family / community centric site is to really take off there needs to be a substantial change in the way sites are addressed and I do n't  see adding more subdomains or sub directories as the answer . <p> I am interested in what you are saying here , but I wonder what happens when you create a slightly different border , bringing people together of different geographical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of say , art . I am experimenting with a community portfolio for folks who ca n't afford to create their own , with the crucial additioin of a community blog ( appropriately called critique ) that will be a place for artists ( or what I prefer to simply call workers ) can share their ideas , concepts , writing , craft in a way for many to see , some to participate . A slight diversion from your comment about your family blog idea ? Anyhow , hmm . Interesting thoughts . Interactivity seems to add some kind of redemption to a medium that seems usually ucerpted by the technology savvy or the product hungry . <p> Thanks for the link to Vancouver Coffee . I think coffee plays a large part to our city - and blogging about it has added a richness to my online experience . Plus , I get to drink great coffee every day ! <p> For the last several years I 've been having the same thoughts about a personal/family website-cum-network project . It seems ironic on the face of it that I 'm not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and do on a daily basis here at work . I guess Ive just been trying to figure out what to do that is n't another lame website that even my family would n't bother with . <p> I 'm also the driver of a van pool , and I have been pondering the creation of a website that my riders could access and would be useful to them as well " helping them to schedule their rides and disseminate other info among them . This would have both private and public access sections ideally , with the public access part helping to promote and encourage van pooling and car pooling . Again Ive been trying to figure out how I would do that and what would be the best technology and format for both . <p> And now I 'm becoming involved with the union here at work , ( I work for the State of Oregon and am represented by SEIU-OPEU. ) and have been tapped to be part of a communications committee . I 'm looking at blogging software to help produce a very localized " newsletter " to help promote communications @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ However , the union is concerned with limiting access to keep the discussion and dialog positive , productive and in bounds and avoid trolling and unnecessary rants and flames . <p> I think as I learn and develop the union project , the other two will fall in place , and some of the resources being shared here will definitely come in handy . <p> I am surprised no one has mentioned http : //www.placeopedia.com/ yet . It is basically a Google Map where users can pinpoint Wikipedia articles . There is not much else that the site does , but it is decently implemented at least ! 30455 @qwx890455 30451 @qwx890451 <p> You are reading " The Local Web " , an entry posted on 17 October , 2005 , to the Script collection .

@@99593585 @3793585/ <p> With a few caveats and a bit of apprehension , I present to you my latest pet project : The CSS Zen Garden . <p> Since I just about missed it ( I could have sworn it was May 8th , 2003 , but my archives do n't  lie ) I do n't  have anything much planned to mark the occasion . So lacking that , I 'll take you through some of my design process when I was building Tranquille , the default template . <p> Everything but the type in Tranquille was hand-painted in Photoshop , similar to the process I used for design #013 , Coastal Breeze . ( The images for the latter were done years ago for another long-dead site of mine ) <p> It began on a sketchpad , which I do n't  have anymore unfortunately . The title text was important to me , since I was interested in a calligraphic , natural brush stroke look . A paintbrush , some india ink , and an hour spent in concentration determined that I just cant do calligraphy . Lesson learned . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on hand that seemed to work , Calligraphic 421 from Bitstream . I 'd probably use a different choice if I were doing it again , but that 's just changing tastes for you . <p> I spent a bit of time researching the Kanji in the scroll that hangs down from the top left corner . Rather than pull a Westerner and use a bunch of random characters that would quickly prove my ignorance , I tried to find something with meaning , however tenuous . <p> The symbols I chose represent , roughly , A beginning , Complete or Whole , and Skill . I suppose I wanted to say something like Were trying something new or similar , and maybe that even works in some contexts . But if it does its more luck than anything . <p> The pagoda in the top right was also researched , though not heavily . I flipped through Google image search for some inspiration , and ended up finding exactly what I was looking for , completely coincidentally , in a Mozilla Lizard illustration on DMOZ . Somehow that seems appropriate . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then applied some texture and shading to tie it into the Tranquille style . Stealing ? Please . Let 's call it creative misappropriation . <p> Remember the project in grade school that had you dump some india ink onto a sheet of white paper , then blow it with a drinking straw to create a black tree-like shape , and finally paste on crumpled pieces of tissue paper as blossoms ? <p> The tree in the bottom right corner grew out of fond memories of that project . As you can see from the above example , it had to go through a few revisions to start looking right . The simple , solid tree above just did n't  cut it , obviously . So back to my Photoshop painting techniques to flesh it out . <p> As you can see , the process involves sketching a rough outline with simple colours , then building up layered detail over top . There are many different ways to achieve this , involving burns and dodges and colour/level/saturation adjustment layers . <p> My preference is to build every new **31;2223;TOOLONG on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without affecting anything else . This leads to plenty of layers of course , so the new nested layer folders in Photoshop CS are a welcome addition . ( for an extreme example , Coastal Breeze ended up having well over 300 layers by the time it was done ) <p> So there you go , Tranquille in a nutshell . Happy first year , baby . 30454 @qwx890454 <p> Like any good endeavour , the Zen Garden seems both like it just arrived and like its been around forever . It remains the best way to explain the capabilitieof CSS-based design to nonweb people , with only a bit of background : <p> " See this web page ? Okay , now look at this one . Its the same web page . This one too , and this one . No really . The *same page* . " <p> Then they get it . It convinced me to go further with web standards than I had before ( which still is n't very far ) too . <p> Thanks , Dave , for putting it together , and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ive been following CSS Zen Garden for about two or three months now , and I just have to say that it has inspired me . <p> Thanks to The Garden I 've aspired to create more complex designs and implement browser-compatability . Its taught me the true limits of design , and even those seem endless everytime a new design is added . <p> What Zeldman preached you visualized . Kind of a " **28;2256;TOOLONG " approch . I agree with the others that it is a great source of inspiration and sets a real good example of the power of webstandards . Nice going and keep up the good work ! <p> I just wanted to thank you for such an inspiring project . I just happened upon the CSS Zen Garden by chance . After seeing projects in the Garden , I began to take CSS ( and for that matter web standards and accessibility ) seriously . Bravo to everyone who contributes ! <p> Thank you for creating such a profound resource of web design inspiration . <p> I first came across CSS Zen Garden when I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out exactly what was going on . Then a few months later I came back , and it blew my socks off ! I actually had trouble sleeping for the next week ( seriously ) because of the excitement it sparked for web design . <p> Wow , I cant believe its only been a year since you released the Garden to the public . Somehow it seem much longer The Garden is my default site for showing people what CSS can do . There are still a lot of programmers and " non-designers " who code old-school ( table-based ) HTML and just do n't  see the point of learning CSS . The Garden usually makes a pretty good impression . ; ) <p> Thank you , Dave ! Your efforts ( along with all the people who have contributed ) has made it so much easier to show people what 's possible with modern coding and separation of content and presentation . Happy birthday , Zen Garden ! : - ) <p> The Garden is what first sparked my interest in CSS . I viewed its source and studied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ landed a job because they were especially impressed with my knowledge of CSS . Thank you . <p> Thank you for providing the inspiration to learn more , and to challenge myself further . Countless hours have been spent trying to answer the *how the did they do that ? * Now if only there was a way to incorporate CSS into my dayjob , I would truly be happy . <p> Thanks Dave , and here is to another year of innovation . Geez , alot can happen in a year , eh ? <p> I have to say that this project was what " put me over the hump " with CSS . I 'd be dabbling for quite awhile and was on the cusp of really " getting " CSS and what it was capable of when I tried my had at a Zen Garden entry ( I was the first one outside of Dave ) and I found it , well , easy , thus reinforcing the benefits of CSS in my mind . <p> I look back now and really wish I 'd spent a bit more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creativity of the Zen Garden entries . There is so much that puts mine quite to shame ! That 's a good thing ! <p> As a trainer and educator in markup and CSS , nothing - simply nothing - has helped me more in demonstrating both the potential beauty of CSS-driven layouts , the practicality of structured markup , and the ease with which sites can be made accessible than the CSS Zen Garden . <p> As a Web standards evangelist , I 'm also 100% confident that wed be battling a much harder battle had the CSS Zen Garden not bloomed . <p> So Happy Birthday CSS Zen Garden , congrats to the many contributing designers , and most especially , thank you Dave Shea for making the web even more wonderful than I ever dreamed it could be . <p> Happy Birthday Zen Garden ! I came here only a couple of months ago , through a link from a web help group , and was suitably amazed and awed at what can be done with css . I had never done any before then , and am currently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and spacer gifs " site into one using css and web standards . It is a bit of a slog but will definitely be well worth it . Thank you for the inspiration to make a start . It will be quite some time before I am up to Zen Garden standards , but at least you convinced me to try ! <p> Like so many who have posted here , I too have been inspired to dig deeper into what can be done with CSS . I am not a web designer , but I have a personal site that I use as an electronic newsletter of sorts for friends and family . I am also in the process of putting together an online portfolio for my editing work , and came across CZG when looking for CSS tutorials . What a great concept ! And everyones work is excellent . I am redesigning my personal site , and re-working my portfolio concept to take advantage of some of the more unique ideas presented in some of the designs . <p> Thanks for putting this great resource together ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of CSS design . <p> I was very inspired by the gathered ideas on CSS Zen Garden too , an i love it . <p> But there is one thing I think is sad about CSS Zen Garden . The most designs are not fluid with all the disadvantages . I would like to see much more fluid CSS Zen Garden designs where is no matter how big your window is . <p> Thank you so very much . I learned to build webpages because my partner is a web designer . I have only ever built CSS based pages , as this was the direction my partner pushed me in when I expressed an interest in designing my own site . He did n't  actually teahc me web design but instead showed me several useful sites , starting with this one . <p> After I had finished I went out into the big wide world ( actually it was where I work ) and showed people my new site , and explained CSS to them , badly . After watching their confused faces for a while I gave up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work here has demonstrated CSS to so many in a way that is far more elegant than mine . <p> It has also served to dispell the myth that the only sites you can design using CSS are small green bordered boxes . <p> Congratulations ! People have been reading and hearing for years that CSS could do wonders . You showed us the wonders . Seeing is believing , and you made believers out of a lot the previously unconvinced . <p> Congrats , Dave ! Not only did the Garden grow out to be THE place to show and say " I told you so " when people ask if you can design beautiful sites with CSS , just this morning I referred to a couple of the great designs as such as a source of design inspiration . <p> Perhaps the one best way to get people to stop laughing at CSS and , indeed , want to learn it . And , undoubtedly , inspiration , this excellent showcase of design calibre with CSS . Happy Birthday to the Zen Garden . <p> Its only been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it within a couple of weeks of launch , then . Its one of the greatest resources on the web ( as far as design goes ) and its URL is always my answer when anyone asks me " Why use CSS ?

@@99593587 @3793587/ <p> Working on a PC , I have never found a satisfactory way of building my own macros . ( Mac OS has offered AppleScript for years , of course . ) Some software allows me to define my own shortcut keys , others do n't  . Photoshop allows for simple automation in the form of Actions , and I 've put them to some use which I figured I 'd share . <p> Builtin keyboard shortcuts are great , but not all functions have them straight out of the box . I 've remapped the function keys to give me an extra set of keyboard shortcuts . Some effects I use every day , others I never touch . I want the frequent ones at my fingertips , so hijacking the basic function keys ( which show and hide specific palettes by default , not nearly as important to me ) was the way to go . Your milage may vary , but here 's my list which I 've been using for well over two years now ( F7 and F9 are strangely vacant ) : <h> F2 Crop <p> I use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an image , I 'm far more inclined to select an area with a marquee and then Image-&gt;Crop , rather than use Photoshops builtin Crop tool . This is one of the quirks about my workflow , but I find it particularly handy when working with smaller GIFs and bits of images that need tiny little adjustments . <h> F3 Image Size <p> Mainly for scaling down images . Judicious use of both this tool , cropping , and canvas resizing are completely musthave tools . Literally every single image I work on requires use of at least one of the three , but frequently a combination of them . <h> F4 Canvas Size <p> To add extra space around the image , or to crop , canvas resizing is one of the holy trinity of image sizing mentioned above . <h> F5 Gaussian Blur <p> Blur is often overused , but I do find it completely necessary in many instances . Whether I 'm fudging detail in a lowres image , building texture by blurring layers and blending them , or even building a drop shadow by hand blur control makes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opposite of blur in many regards , Unsharp Mask is mainly useful when scaling images . A reduction in size blurs an image after a certain level , and Unsharp Mask is the best way to reduce the blur and emphasize detail . The easiest tool to use completely wrong , there are plentyoftips on using sharpening properly . I find the easiest setting for web purposes is leaving my radius at 0.2 and adjusting the amount as necessary , while ignoring the levels . <h> F8 Stroke <p> Not the most necessary tool at my disposal , but I frequently find it valuable when working with small graphics specifically for the web . I use it much the same as I do my cropping first I 'll build the selection with the marquee , then I 'll add a stroke . With Photoshop 6+ and its builtin shape tools , I often times find myself selecting a shape layer , then stroking a simple border on a new layer . <h> F10 Convert to RGB <p> A quick way to convert a recentlyopened GIF to something I can work with , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ photos to the colour model the web knows and loves . When I 'm making small changes to GIF files I find I do n't  always need to do this but any changes requiring outofpalette colour need a cleansing first . <p> ( Anyone still remembering this stillempty promise need not fear : I have n't forgotten . I 've just had a better project to work on in the meantime . One day it will come , however. ) 30454 @qwx890454 <p> I typically group like-minded functions to one function key , using shift/ctrl+Fx to create families of functions . So F2 is New Layer , but shift+F2 is Duplicate Layer , and ctrl+F2 is Delete Layerjust the way I think , I suppose <p> Makes sense to me . I 'm surprised I 've never though of shortcutting layer functions - although I guess I 've got my mouse in the palette anyway to select the active layer , so may as well just move it an extra half inch to use the buttons .

@@99593588 @3793588/ <p> One day soon I will make a post that is non CSSrelated . It will happen , I swear it . <p> On to business . Simon Willison has takenon two of the most vocal critics of CSS in the past few weeks , Dave Winer and Jamie Zawinski . Both of the mentioned debates generated a flurry of controversy , and catalyzed argument on whether to use CSS or not . <p> Simons examples are coded well , documented well , and generally make a good point : using nested tables to achieve visual effect is a concept whose time is coming to an end . <p> The more I see examples like this where existing design techniques are converted to CSS layouts , the more I see two very tense camps forming . There are people who use CSS daily , who would n't give it up for the world , and who realize that quirks and bugs aside , browser support is solid enough for use . There are also people who have n't bought into it yet , who see the somewhat inconsistent support amongst browsers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time . <p> A note to both camps : tablebased layouts still work . They are n't  going anywhere . CSSbased layouts also work , as more and more people are proving . It boils down to this consider who you 're designing your site for , and use the appropriate tool . <p> If you want elegant code that 's a snap to edit later , but can cause headaches as you learn the quirks of todays browsers , chose CSS . <p> People who turn this into a silly allornothing debate are missing the bigger picture here : the user does n't  give a damn about how you built the site . They want it to load fast , they want it to navigate well , they want it to look good , and they want it to work . The rest of this is , ironically , just semantics . 30454 @qwx890454 <p> You hit the nail on the head . As with any holy war that has been waged online ( and this is rapidly becoming one ) the users are being forgotten . I have been eagerly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your blog and many , many others . I am implementing things ( my homepage is a close proximity to how Erics used to look ) . I even took one of my most popular sites and made it almost 100% CSS ( for the homepage ) - and I am about to process the logs and see if I have had any drop off in users . This is the real question to me - what impact will I have on my user base ? Especially when there are other sites out there providing similar information . Forcing a captive audience to upgrade a browser is one thing , but an audience that has options , that is another thing entirely . I 'd like my sites to still be around by the time users have the most recent , standards compliant browsers <p> I am not anti-CSS . All my new sites are CSS-based . The people who cast it that way were wrong . They must not have actually been following what I was doing . If you read the archive of Scripting News you 'll see . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a bigger issue than whether one uses CSS or not . <p> Dave , thanks for replying . I had been wondering about the extent of your comments , since such a minor post generated such a huge amount of traffic . For an outsider in the coding community like me , its been weird to see that kind of response . I assumed there must have been a precedent , since that post alone sure wasnt enough to cause interest on that level . <p> I must say , though , that I 'm quite dissapointed that your site is not accessible to the deceased OR the unconscious AND is not viewable on Timex Indiglo ! And you call yourself a web developer ? ! ? Havent you heard of , like , Jakob Zeldman ? <p> Kris , you have no idea how close to the mark that statement is . It seems there are people out there who have a very rigid definition of what makes a successful site , which may or may not be based on reality . Anything that does n't  fall into that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ failure , and sometimes they even feel the need to tell me about it . <p> I 'm a big picture type person , and can see the good and bad in just about everything . I have a hard time relating to people who get so wrapped up in small details that they ignore the rest of it .

As in Thursday . I know this because our benefits provider at the day job has just informed us . We were given a URL and a phone number , both of which enable us to register . Given that its crunch time , youd expect both to be busy , right ? <p> Its worse . The phone number has been a busy signal for two days .

This might be an inconvenience , if hitting Refresh a bunch of times were to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asinine Javascript functions are running to make sure you cant use the back or forward buttons . When a click of the " next " button induces a " Page can not be found " error , it means you have to start all over again . <p> My favorite useless message so far has been " This page ca n't be displayed due to an internal error . The server may be busy , or you may have to adjust your settings . " No mention , naturally , of how the settings should be adjusted . <p> This is terribly poor planning . A system that is literally unusable three days before a deadline effectively means the deadline passed three days early . Heres hoping the Ministry graciously extends the deadline , since they completely failed to account for the rush before the end of the month . 30454 @qwx890454 <p> Further investigation seems to reveal that May 1st isnt a deadline , per se , rather an initialization date . Seemingly everyone is still covered afterward , so it begs the question why the rush ? Wires are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I am currently ignoring this call to re-register . I suppose it helps that , at 30 , I 'm still enjoying perfect health . I pay the premiums , but I 'm in no hurry to file any more info . <p> Also , the Liberal govt recently sent me a request for more info pertaining to PST . I am a small business person , and now they want to collect , among other things , my GST number . They claim that they are " improving the system " and it will translate to making things easier for me . What a fraud ! <p> It seems to me an obvious assumption that they want to collect GST data to cross-referece against their PST data to make sure that no one is cheating somehow . Which is fine I understand how Big Govt = Big Brother . But hey , I collect PST from all of my clients on their behalf , and submit it every 4 months on time to advoid penalty .

@@99593590 @3793590/ <p> Alright , this one is a little hard to process : Macromedia just got bought by Adobe in a deal worth $3.4 billion in stock . Its hard to say that without saying it again : Adobe just bought Macromedia. ( asssuming shareholders and regulators approve etc. etc . ) <p> Adobe started off making fantastic products for print designers , and has spent the past 7 or 8 years trying to get a foothold on the web . Unsuccessfully , I 'd add , as the last time anyone used an Adobe product to generate actual production-ready HTML code would have been some time before the Euro went into wide circulation . Discounting the production work that happens in Photoshop/Illustrator , there are no stand-out Adobe web development tools . LiveMotion ? Dead and gone . GoLive ? GoLifeSupport . ImageReady ? Well , its been a while since Ive personally hit the little button at the bottom of my Photoshop toolbar , but at least that one gets used by other designers from time to time . ( Okay , and my GoLive crack was a cheap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Macromedia , on the other hand , has been the young-and-hip counterpart , building a product line almost exclusively focused on the web . Dreamweaver , Flash , Contribute , Fireworks , ColdFusion , need I go on ? Except in a business sense , theyve only been mildly successful , evidenced by the fact that they do n't  totally own the market they 're in . <p> So now the two join forces . Why ? Oh , I think Flash might have something to do with it . Competition over the formats and tools of tomorrows rich applications is heating up , and Adobe did n't  have a foot in the door until today . Sure , they 've been big on SVG all along , if perhaps by default , but there are a lot of reasons why SVG is probably not going to be the lingua franca of the future application space . Low implementation rates , a hazy future , and very little developer interest . ( Although , interestingly , SVG has a mobile version which is apparently gathering a lot of steam in the handheld @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is a viable option here and now . It has the potential and the developer base to build tomorrows applications . A couple of questions naturally follow : what will become of Adobes long-standing commitment to SVG , now that Flash is in the fold ? Since SWF is an open format and Macromedia makes money on the player anyway , would there be a business case in transitioning SWF to SVG ? <p> But this is also where the fear , uncertainty and doubt kicks in . If Adobe is gearing up for a battle in the rich application space , what happens if they lose ? They 're not exactly known for their coding tools at the moment ; presumably , key Macromedia teams will be in charge of ensuring the design tools work well with the development tools . From a technical standpoint , a lot remains to be proven . From a competition standpoint , well as best as I can tell , their main competition is a stable of open source technologies , and Microsoft . That 's almost a rigged game , where a likely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interests . Remember how Microsoft sent a rep to promote their latest and greatest to a crowd of Flash developers ? <p> The combined Macromedia and Adobe stable of design software is industry standard ; with this buyout , Adobe essentially has a monopoly over the design world . ( Quark aside . Very far aside . ) So theyll always have that to fall back on . But investors like growth . If the growth stops , or slows , or does anything short of grow , investors react . This particular method of growth is risky , given the competition , and if it fails to materialize , then what ? Another buyout ? By whom ? <p> And this is just one particular line of inquiry of many . There are hundreds of other questions which have been asked elsewhere , regarding product lines and feature merging and PDF and and and . Over time , well get the answers . Heres hoping this move pays off . <p> I personally prefer Fireworks to ImageReady and Freehand to Illustrator and am very nervous on how Adobe could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absolutely use Photoshop for all my digital imaging , but for layouts I almost always use FW . <p> Not to mention that now all MM software will be jacked up to Adobe prices . ( OUCH ! ) <p> And I hate to say itbut what about support and customer service ? I cant remember the last time I got good customer service from Adobe , whereas , the opposite is true with MM ( maybe others would disagree , I du n no . ) <p> Oh , and uhwhat exactly is the " complementary functionality of Macromedia Flash and Adobe PDF " ? They are both on the web ? <p> First thing I thought when I saw the news this morning was " Oh cr*p , now they are going to chop Studio MX in pieces and shove it into Photoshop ! " <p> These are kinda sad news for me . I have been using Fireworks since version 1 ( circa 1998 ) and have come to appreciate the convenient , unique features that such program offers to me in day-to-day web production , offering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't  . Using Photoshop for web graphics is akin to driving a Hummer just to get to the grocery store two blocks away . <p> At this time , it is uncertain what will be the outcome of Adobe buying MM , but one thing is clear - in any case , things will change , for better or worse ( let 's hope the former ) . <p> I 'm very uneasy about the monopolistic aspects , but I am quite optimistic about the resulting products . While MM have been more attuned to the web in general , Adobe have had a much better approach to opening formats , and in general their products have a far more solid , less buggy feel . Frankly I have often found MM visual interfaces annoying and frustrating for more than 10 years now - I 'll be glad to see them reworked by Adobe . I think there are some great strengths on both sides . <p> Does anybody remember back to Adobe buying PageMaker from Aldus ? Yes , PageMaker was n't Quark in those days , but then Quark was n't PageMaker either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that InDesign was born out of this particular Adobe buy and now we have a fantastic and incredibly competitive layout program that has wonderful **33;2286;TOOLONG across the other important image software for print : Photoshop and Illustrator . <p> Then , Adobe had assessed the markets need and wants - Quark too expensive and inflexible ; PageMaker okay , but , not as good as it could be - and gave us a great software solution to those issues . Hopefully , the same philosophy , wisdom and spirit is at play here . <p> I too was quite shocked by this news story I wonder if theyll even get approval , since it would be a monopoly . <p> One comment I wanted to make , though - have you seen GoLive CS2 ? I have n't used it yet , but from what I hear its ground-up built around CSS-based design . Sounded like a really cool package , but I have n't heard many CSS designers talk about it thus far . <p> Years ago , many of the improvements in Macromedias and Adobes products were driven by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Recently not so much , but it was still good to have two strong competitors in the design marketplace . <p> What the combined company has ( or will have , I should say ) now is a strong slate of software products and file formats across the design spectrum . Maintaining control over PDF , PSD , SWF , AI , and PostScript right across the board , as well as having both Photoshop and Dreamweaver under the tent is a pretty big field . <p> But who 's going to push Adobedia now ? As Dave said , open source and Microsoft are two big forces . The combined team is going to have to be very smart , and not assume that Flash , Dreamweaver , Acrobat , Photoshop , and Illustrator are going to keep them profitable in the long term . <p> Too bad , though . I did like Macromedias software boxes better than Adobes . <p> Will you join me in a murderous rampage if Fireworks somehow gets lost between all this ? I know you are one of the chosen few who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making web graphics ( or god forbid , page designs ) in Photoshop is akin to scratching your back using a prosthetic foot . <p> This is pretty much my main fear about the merger - I 'm not sure Adobe really " gets " Fireworks niche usefulness . <p> " I know you are one of the chosen few who appreciate Fireworks for what it is , and realize that making web graphics ( or god forbid , page designs ) in Photoshop is akin to scratching your back using a prosthetic foot . " <p> ? <p> Where did you get that from ? I use Fireworks from time to time , sure . But I work primarily in Photoshop and Illustrator . Yes , even for ( god forbid ) page designs . <p> Well I 'm feeling sort of silly now , but I could have sworn you wrote something along the lines of Fireworks being the better choice for web vectors around the time you made the ice-skating girl illustration back in December . <p> Suffice to say , I certainly think Fireworks is the better choice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll be pretty peeved if they decide to pull it . <p> Well , that 's a big move . In my humble opinion , it is really dangerous , a bit like the Microsoft problem . Adobe is now a monopoly and they have their hotel on each card of the game . Now , who will successfully get away without paying the big bill ? <p> Expect to see a raise in software prices . If there is no competition , consumer will pay . However , this could end up in better open-source products like The Gimp , as some designers will not be able to afford that too easily . One thing I hope is that they will keep working on their actual products . We still need useful updates , and we , customers , have to keep pushing to get them , even if there is no more competition . They will need new competitors , competitors that create really good products , even better than Photoshop , InDesign , Dreamweaver , Illustrator . I think the real problem here is Flash as no one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ designs without paying royalties to Adobe . <p> We all hope it will not get too bad , but hey , moneys talking here ! Raise your software budget ! <p> I 'm not much of a designer or anything , but I fail to see how this could be even the slightest improvement in any conceivable way . <p> Adobe was already doing little to improve their graphics products ( at least from my limited view ) , but now that their main competitor is gone , are we to expect more ? <p> Sure open source is working on some things and I guess Microsoft is aware that the market exists , but that 's not what I 'd consider competition . <p> I 'm really not familiar with every aspect of the design market , so I might be missing some obvious things , but as a user of web and graphics software , I 'm kinda worried that were in for a decade of suck . <p> if i can be so bold as to make predictions , i 'd say that fireworks will find itself merged into imageready. and , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was so unceremoniously killed off , i can only hope that adobe will resurrect its wonderfully intuitive ( for an old after effects hand like me ) interface and graft it back on top of the powerful functionality of macromedia flash . <p> exciting times aheadalthough the monopolistic aspects scare the hell out of me <p> Flash is an " open " format ? Really ? Why then is there no Flash Player for Linux PPC and Linux x86-64 ? If SWF is , in fact , truly open , I would expect to see some sort of usable player for each of these platforms . Theoretically , these players would be " open " too . <p> One option I 'm not sure Ive seen mentioned is the merging of Fireworks , Imageready and a lesser known , but reasonably effective imaging product - Adobe Elements . For those who have n't used it , Elements is a scaled back version of Photoshop with many of the same features , but at a much smaller price . <p> I use Photoshop for my digital imaging and design needs , so I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understand the concern by those that use it exclusively - esp . those who do web imaging only . <p> I do very strongly agree with one statement that I saw elsewhere - at least it was n't Microsoft buying Macromedia . Take it from someone who has used ColdFusion for a while and is now being forced to switch over to C#.NET . Not good times . And yes , I understand the benefits of OO programming . <p> I just hope that Adobe retains the customer support level that Macromedia has maintained . Our development team has been able to make direct contact with the CF development team on more than one occasion - sometimes with the product lead . And at Macromedia MAX , a room full of developers was able to lob questions and needs directly at the entire development team of both ColdFusion and Flash . Tell me that happens with any MS productsdidnt think so . <p> Really . The byte code was opened for development and extension by third parties years ago , although Google is telling me that shockingly little evidence of that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up with : <p> You will notice the quotes around the word " open " in my original article , because it was never truly " open sourced " . No third-party players ? No idea why . These guys made a commercial development tool out of it though : <p> I have to say I 'm excited . As mentionend by Matt above , MM interfaces have always been very bugging . I 'm particularly frustrated by Flashs implementation of bezier curves . There is little precision control over the curves . It can be very frustrating . I have always felt that Adobes interfaces were the best of any software in any market . <p> I feel the same way about Adobes software manuals . They are intensely thorough yet clean . The information is easy to find and consume . On the other hand MMs software manuals are a hoax at best . When learning flash , I was frustrated at the details left out in the software manual . <p> The fears that innovation at Adobe will diminish are unfounded . Photoshop is the best software package ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of software so thorough and well built . And Adobe continues to innovate this product despite having no real direct competition . No one comes close and yet they still innovate . <p> Adobe has never rested on its laurels and I do n't  see the acquisition of MM changing that . I am excited for the integrity of production that Adobe will bring to MMs products and software manuals . I expect this to be a great step forward in terms of ease of workflow . <p> One more noteall the talk has been focused around MMs web apps and mostly Flash . Do n't  forget that MM also owns Fontographer . Let 's hope that little gem gets to see daylight again under the helm of Adobe . <p> I 'm wondering what will happen to Freehand in particular . When Adobe bought Aldus , Freehand looked like it would die , but fortunately for all the Freehand users , Macromedia took it over . Maybe where there 's crossover , Adobe will allow those Macromedia products to go elsewhere again . <p> My main concerns with this merger is Adobe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Adobe acrobat reader . ( and we all know how good that product is ) <p> Macromedia has had a roadmap for linux compatibility for sometime primarily with full wine support then portage . Working in a Web Development shop that is moving towards being entirly linux based this could be a major PITA . Who knows adobe might actually follow suit . <p> At least they will stop suing each other for patent infringement the patents being what any software developer would call " logical progression " ! But that 's what scares me , all that IP in one place . its going to be hard for any serious competition in a market that REALLY needs it . <p> This is bad news . Adobe is an aging dinosaur in may respects . Bloated software , poor interfaces , bad support , etc . As a web dev/designer I work with Macromedia almost exclusively ( save a little Photoshop ) . Time to say goodbye to my beloved Fireworks . Dreamweaver will get hacked up and grafted onto GoLive . You could go on and on about how bad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does is boost shares and the bottom line for the short term and leaves the customers to get the shaft . So much for competition and innovation . Corporate megalomaniacs suck . <p> &gt;&gt;This is a bit grim . I cant stand the feel or interface of Photoshop et al . &lt;&lt; I absolutely agree on that , most people I know agree that the UI for Adobe apps has been going downhill since Photoshop 5 or 6 . <p> &gt;&gt; " Adobe was already doing little to improve their graphics products " : The changes to CS2 are huge . They continue to add loads of improved features to their creative suite . &lt;&lt; The above was the context I was talking about , sure Adobe have added loads of bells and whistles to their apps , but I have problems finding all the juicy new stuff under the mire of clunky interface . For this reason I 'm still using photoshop 7 - the last semi-reasonable photoshop Ui imo . <p> I 'm pleasantly suprised to see I 'm not alone in my consternation over Fireworks impending doom and also pleased @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is . Maybe we need a " Save Fireworks " campaign then again if its going to cost as much as Photoshop maybe we should all just support the GIMP instead . <p> Re : Homesite , Stephen said " Whens the last time Macromedia actually updated it ? " <p> Well , they had a small team still working on it - I 've answered survey e-mails from the team lead , asking what I 'd like to see in a future version of Homesite , but admittedly the last one was almost a year ago now . <p> The coding side of this is less important , I 'll jump ship to Zend and Topstyle when the time comes , but for web graphics itll be a sad day when Adobe starts butchering the fine product that Fireworks has matured into . <p> &gt; Unsuccessfully , I 'd add , as the last time anyone used an Adobe product to generate actual production-ready HTML code would have been some time before the Euro went into wide circulation . <p> I do n't  understand this . All of my GoLive-built sites validate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with GoLive then you do n't  know what you are doing . <p> As for GoLive CS2 , yes , it has even more features for designing with CSS . For example , the layout grid , which used to be table-based and something few serious GoLive users would touch , now generates CSS instead of tables . <p> i hope that the future versions of both Dreamweaver , Flash and Fireworks will have support for SVG as nearly all the other Adobe products do extensively support SWF omigosh what will happen to CFML or will we see a similar thing which happened to Homesite and Dreamweaver ? <p> Macromedias pneuma is killed by this transaction . I wont be surprised if , in a closed future , they annouce a fusion of their developpers into the same entity , and after that , theyll make some drastic cut . Be sure that Macromedias engineers will soon be available on the market . ( Sorry for my poor english ) <p> At first I thought this was a bad idea , then I started to think it has happened on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure Adobe did n't  build everything in their Creative Suite . <p> Why not do it on a large scale , better interaction between softwear and more tools in one place . With programs like Flash that are capable of " publishing " in many standard formats , including *. pdf now , will be easier to use and have better features that work better . <p> The first problem I see is multiple file types *. psd vs. *. png . I think we need to scrap the *. jpg . <p> For one , we can be quite sure prices will sky-rocket once the merger is complete . Also , Adobes support is n't what it should be ( though I 've heard lots of bad words about Macromedias support as well ) . <p> Adobe seems to spend as much time and money on both Mac and Win platform as opposed to Macromedia as they just do n't  seem to care about the Mac at all ( except taking money out of our pockets ) . Flash 5 was the last release that was truly good on the Mac @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their installers together because those give me the biggest grief . Installing Illustrator CS was a pain and to top it off it did n't  work properly until after the fourth time I tried installing it . After that though , I have not had any crashes which is not what you can say about Flash <p> I think it will be great for Flash-lovers but its going to cost a hell of a lot of money . Other than that I doubt it Adobe will make any innovating changes over the next years if there is no competition <p> Regarding the " open format " question : there 's a couple projects I 'm familiar with . On my AMD64 box , under gentoo , I 've had luck with gplflash : http : **27;2321;TOOLONG as a firefox plugin . Another swf player implementing the open standard is swfdec http : **25;2350;TOOLONG , which I have n't used . In terms of authoring tools , on the other hand , there 's laszlo ( http : **33;2377;TOOLONG ) which I beleive ends up outputting swfs , though I have n't used it ( no J2EE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look very interesting though . <p> Oh , as an addendum to put my post on topic , regarding the prospective acquisition , it seems to me that the two most annoying formats on the web today are flash and pdfs , and this is especially the case for those without bandwidth . I see this merger as a threat to an open , standards-based web and a bad thing in general . <p> This is bad news . Adobe is an aging dinosaur in may respects . Bloated software , poor interfaces , bad support , etc . As a web dev/designer I work with Macromedia almost exclusively ( save a little Photoshop ) . Time to say goodbye to my beloved Fireworks . Dreamweaver will get hacked up and grafted onto GoLive . You could go on and on about how bad this is for the design community . <p> We do n't  know what is happening as a result of the merger between Macromedia and Adobe . One representative deep inside Adobe has commented that there is strong standards support within the company . Rachel Andrew and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Before the merger Macromedia were testing their products against the Acid 2 test . 30455 @qwx890455 30451 @qwx890451 <p> You are reading " Macrodobia " , an entry posted on 18 April , 2005 , to the Rusted Staples collection .

@@99593591 @3793591/ <p> Alluded to in the earlier Technical Summary , the next analysis takes a look at the important CSS highlights of Proton . <h> Menus <p> As with the menus in Radar , these were inspired by Eric Meyers Pure CSS Menus demo . Using nothing but strategic placement of : hover they work without a line of Javascript , and degrade to a simple unordered list in older browsers . <p> Well , no script was the goal , but Windows IE does n't  do much when you apply : hover to elements that are n't  links . As noted in the technical notes of this redesign , I launched with Peter Nederlofs whatever:hover but had to back out due to slowness . I 'm hoping to find a way around this when I have a free moment , something that will be a familiar refrain around here for a while as I knock down the various bugs in whatever free time I can find . <p> The markup behind these menus is relatively simple , although I may back out of an earlier decision to provide the text @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ due to the fact that I 'm not yet convinced its worth the overhead to provide what amounts to gratuitous text . The unstyled markup is quite a bit bulkier as well , which means more bytes to download and a lot further to scroll before getting to the content . ( see it yourself , although you 'll have to shake off the cookie if you click that link by following it up with this one . Youve been warned . ) <p> The contact form embedded within the contact menu item was a proof-of-concept , mainly to see what the response would be . Its flaky , and I got the first spam from it within hours of launch , so it wont stay . <h> Content Scaling <p> Some of the looseness comments that have been directed at Proton are no doubt a result of the liquid layout . Resizing the window leaves the center text column at a fixed width , while allowing the white margins on either side to fill the extra space . Except in IE , where the margins stay fixed and its the content @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lack of max-width support . <p> If you scale the text in your browser , the width of the centered text column changes accordingly , filling up the white space . Assuming those with larger windows also run larger resolutions ( a logical assumption ) , and guessing that their fonts are generally smaller anyway , this kills two birds with one stone for those who resize . <p> The CSS behind it is a simple matter of using an em unit on the max-width value , like so : <p> . contentarea max-width : 45em ; padding : 0 25px ; <p> Again , no IE support , so padding was also applied to the edges of . contentarea for the sake of margins in browsers that do n't  support max-width . <h> Accessibility Menu <p> One of the first pieces of markup to occur after the &lt;body&gt; tag is an accessibility menu , which does n't  display on-screen in either Proton or Radar : <p> What is it for ? With this markup , those without style enabled , and those using alternate access devices have a way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Skipping " to " content makes more sense to me as a user than skipping " over " content , since I care about that which I want , not that which I do n't  want . ) We all know by now that display : none does n't  function as expected in screenreaders , so using it to hide this menu adversely affects some of those who need it most . What to do ? <p> A suite of test cases was run against many common screenreaders last year to solve this dilemma , and one CSS technique was a clear winner . This is what I use : <p> #skipNav position : absolute ; left : -9999px ; font-size : small ; <p> By moving the menu off-screen to the left by almost 10,000 pixels ( why not save the byte ? I did , hence 9999 ) we can almost guarantee that it wont display on any browser but those that need it . Note that if the links are underlined , Firefox runs the underline all the way back to the content area . Also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pixels will be enough , you can clip the viewing area of the off-screen menu . The following code virtually guarantees nothing will show up , although the above snippet will usually be sufficient : <p> The fun does n't  stop there . If your browser allows it , try hitting tab to cycle through the pages links and form elements . By hooking into the : focus link state and absolutely positioning the individual links back into the content area , they show up on-screen as styled blocks . <p> While this method does n't  quite solve the dilemma of visible skip links , the only reason I can see why that is true is browser support . Those with mobility problems who use keyboard navigation can access them , those who are unsighted and using a screenreader can access them , and those browsing with a PDA or cell phone without style enabled can access them . If only : focus were more widely supported <p> And with that , were through todays analysis . Those were the more interesting CSS tidits from this redesign . Ill leave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day . Next up in this series : design notes . 30454 @qwx890454 <p> I was unsure of your new design at first , but its really growing on me . The dropdown menus are rad , but I just noticed one little quirk with them . After mousing over " contact " there is a small gap that you have to " jump " over to get to the form . If you move the cursor down really slowly , the form disappears . <p> Instead of fudging the positioning on the skipnav link(s) with an arbitrarily large value , why not make sure its out of the viewport like this ? <p> position : absolute ; right : 100% ; bottom : 100% ; <p> As long as the elements positioning context was the ICB ( or was at least in the upper left corner ) , as is typically the case with skipnav links , that would push it out the top , left corner . The values could also be altered to suit other specific cases where it was n't . <p> If the performance hit of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could always hard code the required : hover rules into the script . Disadvantage : back to two places to update when a change is made . Perhaps the best method would be to separate the styles that need some help from JavaScript and tell the script which stylesheet needs interpreting . <p> Link to Unstyled : <p> It would have been nicer if the unstyled link dropped the user back onto the article rather than the home page ( ditto for the link back - perhaps with a named anchor ) . <p> Content Scaling : <p> I like your content scaling . Another important function of the padding is creating a minimum margin when the window is narrow , or font is large . <p> Nice write up Dave ! How do you find the time to do it ? I may have mentioned this before on your blog but these are the sort of things I hoped I would be learning at University where I am studying a BA Degree in Interactive Multimedia but they still teach tables , font tags and even " How cool the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tutor said we should design a few versions of the same site for the various different browsers and use " a nifty javascript to take the user to the correct site for their browser " . Keep em coming mate . <p> Nice writeup Dave , the more I come through the new design the more I like it . This one really breathes without becoming unreadable or looking rediculous at wide resolutions . Now when I go back to radar , it feels claustrophobic . Strengthens the case for liquid . <p> A general question I know , and I do n't  want to start a whole thing here , but if a new client came to you today and they had no preference , would you go liquid or stay fixed ? <p> i like your implementation of the " skip " menua good expansion on something i have been using for quite a while on some sites , as outlined here LONG ... the only problem is that - again due to the : hover/:focus issue - it does n't  work for anything other than a single @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the skip TO content idea , I use that for my sites . People do seek A , rather than choose to avoid B so they can access A. Much more positive and real world I feel . <p> I 'm really not sure were I stand on hiding accessibilty options . <p> It s strange that so many of us will display XHTML , CSS , 508 and Accessibilty referer links in our footers as badges of what our designs have achieved , but choose to style the actual accessibility options/tools as hidden from the standard design . <p> Its rather like keeping the wheelchair ramps at the back of public buildings because the look of them might detract with the architects design . <p> Why do we feel the need to hide web accessibility options so thoroughly from our designs ? <p> Hi Dave , Its a shame that comment box wont stay , I thought the effect was really cool . I love the skip links idea - I stumbled across it briefly a few days ago by accident ; but was n't sure what they were or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> As for the text summaries on third level menu items , why do n't  you use the title attribute for the link . That way users with screen readers can chose whether or not to read it , which ca n't be done as easily with a paragraph . I think you should be able to add the image versions using the : : after pseudo-element , rather than the paragraphs , or even a supurfluous , empty span element . Sure , : after still wo n't show up in IE if you eventually provide a javascript fallback for the menus , but IE users could always read it from the tool-tip text , so it still degrades gracefully . <p> There ist another solution to make css based menus work in nonsupporting browsers . The trick is to apply a class ( e.g. . sfhover ) to li elements in the navigation when they are moused over and to remove it when moused out . The only concession : You have to add additional rules to your css file . <p> I have used this accessibility technique for quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ IE. Ive also implemented the same with 3 links on my blog at emps : http : //emps.l-c-n.com/ where it seems to work fine ( tested so far on 7 different machines ) . <p> Wonderful , wonderful to see such an excellent web producer take a chance and " be true to thine own self .

@@99593592 @3793592/ <p> I just got back from the better part of a week in Toronto for the annual Flash in the Can conference . The most common reaction I got after mentioning that I 'd be speaking at this particular conference was , naturally , why ? I very rarely use Flash , and my topic was CSS-related anyway . <p> As I said while speaking , the best I could come up with was that I got invited as the token CSS guy . There were other non-Flash presentations though , some more creatively-inclined ( with obvious relevance ) and some more technically inclined ( with slightly less obvious synergy ) . In that context , I think for both myself and the audience , the talk I did actually fit in . <p> What surprised me was the interest . For my 9am presentation , arguably the worst time slot of any conference , the room was surprisingly full . During Q&amp;A at the end , some very thoughtful and considered questions came up . I could tell that many in the audience were experienced CSS users . Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Can itself was a well-organized , smoothly run conference . I never did get a chance to meet and thank the organizers , so thanks for the invite Shawn . <p> I alternated my time between seeing a few other presentations and exploring Toronto . I managed to catch most of David Carsons talk and a few minutes of Yugo Nakumura on the last day . It seemed that the presenters I specifically wanted to see were content to show their work , say a few words about their process , and end without having covered anything terribly profound . <p> The highlight of the talks I saw was James Patterson , a guy I 'd never heard of before . When he started running through his work though , I immediately recognized his style . He s done enough TV spots that you may too . While you could never call it pretty , its uniquely distinct in a grungy , flawed beauty sense , and I found his creation process absolutely fascinating . He s into automatically generating a final result from simple animation components . He starts on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sampling from his huge library of previously rendered and animated pieces to create the final result . Quite an eye-opener . <p> It being my first time in the city ( I 'm surprisingly non well-travelled in my own country ) , I made a point of exploring Toronto . The first day or two were extremely disorienting . Almost every flight Ive taken over the past three years has landed in the US . Deplaning from a 4.5 hour flight to a city that was still a part of Canada took some adjustment . <p> Yep , I did the CN Tower . The top observation deck is equivalent to 147 stories high , which ( its claimed ) makes it the highest one in the world . There 's a glass floor on one level which is about 110 stories high . Talk about a psychological barrier I 'm not afraid of heights , but walking on a clear floor that high up was extremely uncomfortable . <p> And finally , the people . What I most enjoy about going to conferences is the cool people I get to meet . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a guy who turned out to be Daniel Burka of SilverOrange ( and Firefox logo ) fame , and his former co-worker Geoffrey ( sorry , I never did catch your last name . ) Both were great guys with whom I ended up grabbing lunch and wandering the city . <p> And we did a dinner with the webstandards.to group . As bad with names as I am , I believe those present were Joe , Daniel , Suzanne , Mike , Brice , Joanna , Craig , and no doubt one or two others I 'm missing . It was good to hear about a group across the country doing what I wish we had going here in Vancouver . It might be time to get moving on that <p> Coming tomorrow : a discussion of Microsofts FITC presentation of Avalon ( their new rendering system ) and XAML ( the code that goes along with it ) . <p> Wow that 's awesome . I wish I could go to Toronto sometimes ( I live in vancouver as well ) . How were the new Flash gadgets they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have some new stuff/projects that are supposed to amaze everyone . <p> Ah , come on Dave , I went to the CN Tower for my 10th birthday and my friends and I all jumped up and down on the glass , testing the " eighteen hippopotamus " weight limit . It was fun as heck , and it even got my mother worried and agitated , which was the plan . <p> I 'm hoping to get to the FITC conference in a few years when I have something to gain from it other than a feeling of awe at the scale of information there . Oh , and I need money . Being a student is awesome . <p> Dave , glad you enjoyed your time at FITC . I 'm also glad to hear that you found some method to our madness for inviting a CSS guy to a " Flash " conference . As I 'm sure you noticed , the conference this year was less about Flash and more about design and technology . CSS of course is one technology used to facilitate the delivery of design and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ represent the CSS front we could think of no one better . <p> Unfortunately due to the mass amounts of content we try and squeeze into a limited schedule you did end up being the token CSS guy despite our hopes for that to not be the case . <p> Coming into the FITC weekend , your presentation was the one I was most looking forward to . Flash is nowhere near my thing , and I have fully adapted my web design to web standards . <p> After the first day I met some of the presenters and reviewed some of the other presentation write-ups I will be honest , it was a huge toss-up between yours and just about every other presentation 9am on Saturday . The search engine one and the Keep It Simple looked interesting ; I figured I had known what you would present anyways . <p> I decided to attend yours , even though I am fluent in CSS and Web Standards , and boy am I glad I did . <p> Dave , you explained flashs co-existance with web standards really well . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in flash are not SEO and not accessible . Your examples were valuable and relevant . I hope some of those less familiar with web standards took away some important key points . <p> Also , standing around after Yugos presentation , I found your notes on the podium . I took them hope you do n't  mind . = ) 
@@99593593 @3793593/ <p> The ease of use of Google Maps new satellite imagery integration is going to have some interesting implications . <p> A few days ago , Google integrated its Keyhole technology into Google Maps , allowing an easy one-click switch between map data and satellite imagery . <p> Its a mind-blowing use of technology . If you 've played with the full version of Keyhole before , the novelty is a bit dampened ( especially since the web data is quite a bit lower in resolution ) , but the ability to toggle back and forth between map and satellite views is insanely useful for establishing a sense of scale . <p> Interesting things are happening already . Matt Haughey has been exploring and annotating what he s finding . Jeff Veen thinks its a fulfillment of an Orwellian prophesy , by the people instead of by the government . Privacy concerns for the individual ? Well , there are bound to be those . Read the comments on Jeffs " Google is Watching " post for intelligent rebuttals its not even close to real time data for one , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyway . <p> But corporate and environmental whistle-blowing ? Let 's kick that off right in my own backyard . The province of British Columbia has a huge and thriving forestry industry . There are a lot of things one could say about trade tariffs and exporting practices and pine beetles and other business concerns , as they 've been in the media lately . I have mixed feelings about that industry in general , as it is important to the local economy , and Ive done my share of work for companies that earn their money from cutting down trees . <p> But that 's as far as I 'll go to defend it . A picture is worth a thousand words and all that , so here 's a 4000 word essay on what the forestry industry is doing in British Columbia , as of whatever the date was when the satellite snapped these . Click through any image to get to the Google Maps bookmark of the same , its worth it to move around a bit and get a sheer sense of scale ( and see how much more there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) <p> What 's it like on the ground in one of these clear cut areas ? Well , if you 're lucky and the operators of the cut have actually replanted anything , its generally a young glade of small but healthy trees . <p> If they have n't , its ugly . The bleak ground is covered with gnarled and torn wood left behind to rot in the elements , and muddy where the root systems that used to keep the soil together have died . Its disgustingly barren , while at the same time being impassable due to the amount of dead vegetation littering the destroyed ecosystem . I wish I had some photos of that , perhaps I 'll see what I can dig up . <p> Peter , there were a few comments on Jeff Veens article along the same lines . MapQuest and others have had satellite photos for ages , its just the Google UI that 's turning heads this time around . I 'm not sure how the data sets compare though . <p> Re : forestry . Perhaps . It should probably be noted that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 've heard the same arguments before though , and I 'm neither agreeing nor disagreeing with them . Seeing what I see on the maps , I 'd have a hard time believing the scale of forestry in this province is healthy . <p> Wow , using satellite imagery to put the effects of logging into perspective . Now that 's cool ( in a sad way ) . <p> My Dad lives in Southern Oregon , an area that is heavily reliant on the logging industry and the visible effects of this are everywhere ( from the ground ) . I went ahead and checked out that part of Oregon with Google Maps and it looks virgin compared to the land you have shown around Vancouver . That is very sad . <p> Its true that forest needs maintenence to be healthy . Mother Nature used to take care of this " herself " by means of forest fires " but the U.S. has had a policy of putting out fires for most of the 20th century . <p> Harvesting can also be helpful , but if were talking solely in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are n't  marketable " its dead trees , diseased trees and underbrush . <p> Selective harvesting of healthy wood can fit into an ecosystem without destroying it , but clearcutting as it is practiced is never good for the ecosystem . The closest we could get , if we want to clearcut , would be to cut , then burn the whole area with a controlled burn and re-seed to simulate a catastrophic forest fire , but its far cheaper for the lumber companies to just clear-cut , so they generally wo n't do anything else unless forced to by government . <p> This is a great post , Dave , thanks for those images . Forestry is just one of those gut-wrenching things that you realise is a necessity , but is still way overdone , and the end product often misused and wasted . <p> I wonder if wood will one day be grown hydroponically , like those tomatoes ? Wouldnt that be weird <p> The image basically shows the majority of the northern half of interior BC . The Coast Mountains in the bottom-left side of the image @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the bottom-right corner . Even if you were to zoom out to a view of the entire province , you could still see the impact of the cuts . The forested areas in Alberta are treated the same . <p> I 'm studying geography at the University of Calgary and look at satellite imagery all the time . Its funny how quickly you become desensitized to clearcuts because they are in basically every image you see of a forest environment . <p> On another note : One problem I have with Google Maps and most of the online map services is that they do n't  have scales . I do n't  think it would be a hard calculation to put on a ratio scale , yet it is a very critical component of any map ( ex : 1:50,000 ) . <p> Thanks for the informative post helping to expose some of the devastation from the logging industry . I think the general public has no idea how much of our forests are being wiped out . Being exposed to imagery would help . The clear cuts are n't  that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I think we have some sort of law that defines scenic buffers ( which are very narrow , something like 200 feet ) but what are they there for except to hide the truth from the public ? <p> Mappy ( for European maps ) also have a similar service for ages , although it was made in Macromedia Flash . But you can also move in the map in " Satellite mode " , and switch from satellite to normal map with a convenient slide . : ) <p> http : //www.mappy.fr/ if you 're interested ( look for " Eiffel tower " in Paris , for example : - ) ; the slide is in the top left corner . <p> &gt;&gt; U.S. has had a policy of putting out fires for most of the 20th century <p> &gt; Not in National Parks , at least until the fire grows out of control . <p> It is true that natural fires in National Parks ( I 'm not sure how National Forests fires are managed ) are now allowed to burn ( unless it is expected to grow out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put out fires in until the latter decades of the 20th century . The huge , out of control fire in Yellowstone in 1988 was in part because there was a large buildup of fuel . On average , the Ponderosa Pine forest that covered much of the western United States would have small natural fires every few years keeping down the fuel that allows fires to grow out of control today . Mechanical thinning is important if these forests are to remain healthy without fires . <p> Unfortunately , these photos are tangible evidence of a legacy too much focus on volume rather than higher value products . If were going to decrease the unsustainable rate of cut , but maintain forestry employment levels , we need to value-add every tree cut down in BC . A continued expansion of raw log exports will increase the prevalence of such pictures into the future . <p> Mezzoblue has been under my " Design " folder in NetNewsWire for a while , now I may have to move it to the " Work " folder . : ) <p> I 'm the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) and we have been campaigning for change in giant logging companies around the world for the last twenty years . We 've had same major victories , too . Boise-Cascade signed a policy agreement with us to stop logging old growth forests just last year . <p> I guess I 'm saying that as nasty as these photos look , there 's no need to feel completely helpless . RAN is currently campaigning against Weyerhaeuser , a major player in the Pacific Northwest and its not hard to get involved . <p> The US government does withhold the right to use what 's called " shutter control " to limit collection and distribution of satellite imagery . The problem is , it only applies to US-based satellites such as LandSat , ORBVIEW-3 , IKONOS and Quickbird . <p> There are many other satellites out there that can produce high spatial resolution imagery such as the French SPOT satellite series , the Indian IRS , and EROS . All of them outside of US control . <p> Because of this , there is very little reason for the US to implement shutter control . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high spatial resolution satellite called ZY-2 , though there 's very little info about it as you can imagine . <p> I think it would be remiss of me to not mention Multimaps similar functionality . The difference is that Multimap lays a semi-transparent map on top of the aerial photo . For example , Waterloo Station in London : <p> I was thinking this very same thing the other day while browsing googles satellite imagery of British Columbia . Of course , the extent of the damage is clear to anyone who flies over in a plane on a sunny day . I hope these images get much more publicity <p> I was checking out the clearcuts in our province the other day as well via google maps Its gross , but I too am desensitized to a degree , as I was a treeplanter at one point and a cutblock became a place to make a bit of money . A whole lot of my friends rely on planting , brushing or fire fighting in the summer to sustain themselves and I am glad that 's at least an option @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The forestry industry is so ingrained into our lives , not just with paper and lumber , but employment in general especially for us here in BC . It cant keep up like this forever though . <p> Disclaimer : I used to live in Prince George , and I used to work in the forestry industry . I also consider myself to be something of an environmentalist as well , so there . <p> I do n't  think I can defend everything the industry does . There 's definitely a lot of bad stuff happening , and if the people and government do n't  control the industry , it sure the hell is n't going to do it by itself . <p> That said <p> Keep in mind that the source satellite imagery for these maps are not showing the true colours that youd actually see on the ground . In that way , its somewhat deceptive . <p> The purpose of satellite imagery is so it can be used for analysis , so they 're going to colour it to show contrast . Theyve just picked fairly natural colouring so it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it is not . <p> The extent of the logging is clearly detailed . What is n't so clear from the imagery is how well the various differently coloured areas are regenerating . <p> Looking at the imagery , it looks like all those areas have just been cut , and are not regenerating . But if you physically have been to many of those areas , you 're going to see forests that have been growing back for 5 , 10 , 15 , or 20 years . Of course , in the interior ( Prince George area ) , it takes 70+ years before a block is going to be ready to be reharvested again . On the coast , it might only take 30 years . <p> Use the data for the purpose it was meant for - for doing some hard-core technical analysis . This data could be used to quantify the environmental damage and policy tradeoffs . That 's what the particular piece of imagery were looking at was designed for - not to solicit an emotional response . <p> No doubt about it , a forest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be the same as a preserved all-natural one . One the other hand , we all use wood and paper products in our daily lives , and this is where they come from . <p> It is true that satellite imagery does n't  capture an exact replica of what our eyes see as " true color " but I would hardly say that the satellite imagery is deceptive in this way . The imagery is from LandSat 7 ( mostly ) using a bands 3 , 2 , 1 assigned to colours red , green and blue . These bands are there to create an quasi-true color image . And sure enhancements are used , but otherwise the thing would appear extremely dark and would be useless ( most likely using linear strech to increase contrast ) . <p> I believe you can do quite a bit of qualitative analysis on what you do see here without expensive image processing software as long as you know what you 're looking at ( though its pretty obvious ) . In the images Dave posted you can clearly see that fresh cuts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a more green in them . Quantitative analysis is a different story , which is where the experts come in . <p> Similarly , I do n't  see why imagery ca n't be used to solicit emotion as well as being used for analysis . How else do you expect society to take notice and work towards enviromentally and somewhat economically viable a solution ? <p> I too was looking those images the other day and comment to some co-workers regarding the amount of clear cuts . <p> Being raised in a household solely supported by timber dollars , its hard for me . I agree that forest management is a critical issue , but it may be hypocritical of me to say so . <p> The best point made is the issue of accountability of people in power . The average citizen has every right to be concerned , and now has one more tool to help them prove a point . These images may be a few years old , but they sure paint a not so pleasant picture . <p> Brian said : " I do n't  see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Certainly , this is an honourable intention , as long as you are making a fair representation of reality .

I doubt I 'm a typical contractor , but my methods ended up covering wide ground and asking questions that I 'd assume a savvy potential client would ask , and I came up with empty hands . <p> It shouldnt have been so tough , but two factors kept me from making a quick choice : I could n't easily tell if the person or company provided the services I was looking for , and I could n't determine whether their level of experience and skill matched what I needed . <p> While its tempting to project a grandiose image of being a large multi-faceted company which is internationally sought-after , the problem with doing so is that you miss out on a lot of smaller work since its assumed you 're too expensive . If you are in fact a large company , the smaller work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you enjoy working on projects that require less of your time , then you may wish to reconsider the message you 're putting forward . The market is large , and getting larger ; there is a need for all levels of skill and experience . <p> What I often could n't tell from visiting a site was if the designer was an employee of some other company , or available for hire . This was important to me in particular as I was looking for an individual . Some do n't  list any affiliation at all which further compounds the problem . <p> When I could distinguish who was an independent , the problem then became evaluating the work . You would n't believe how many do n't  link to their portfolios on their weblogs . If I know you , chances are I know you through your weblog ; if I want to hire you , guess where I 'm going to turn ? <p> And when I found a portfolio , often it did n't  have a wide enough variety of work to form an impression . Naturally a portfolio should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be broken to also include your most recent work ; a stale portfolio instills doubt ) but when there is n't enough work to pick and choose , brevity does n't  solve the problem . You need a good stable of examples to show me what you know . <p> In the end I found what I was looking for , but it strikes me that as were carefully crafting semantically rich markup and visually gorgeous surroundings to deliver our messages within , sometimes that message gets lost in the shuffle . 30454 @qwx890454 <p> Well hold up there Dave . First off , I do n't  link to my portfolio from my blog , like so many others , because it is a secured and private portfolio . You have to log in to get access . I do this because of the IP involved in my portfolio and the kind of clients I have worked for . The other thing is that I do n't  publicly list " hire me " because that often leads to inquiries from projects that either pay too little ( were talking high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i.e. well hire you for 3 months and drop you like a sack of potatoes ) . <p> I find my best job leads come in word of mouth form and that my best job opportunities are ones who seek me out because they know what I do or at least know me through the industry and the community . Its really not worth my time to take a job where they just need someone who can do HTML . I 'd rather take the job where someone needs specifically my IA skill set and has seen and appreciates my work . <p> Excellent , I was looking for some guidelines for making a user-centric portfolio . This is exactly the account I was looking for . Now we can all build something that can accurately express our own capabilities and strengths . Great timing on the post Dave . <p> Ive run into the very problem you mention about " looking expensive " quite a few times in the past . Its one of the reasons Ive " retired " my dkrproductions.com site . <p> Like Nick I get most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't  have a portfolio up for a few reasons : <p> #1 They can be ( are ) a nightmare to maintain . #2 Quite a bit of the work I get would n't " fit " into a portfolio . Not because its not " good " but because the final product has been fussed with ( fussed up - grin ) by a client , its behind a firewall ( I do lots of Intranet work for some reason ) or any number of other reasons . #3 Most of the contacts I get via my sites are n't  worth the time spent to scope out the projects . Its not like someone like yourself comes along looking for work very often . I 'm so busy right now its almost like I have to know you or have been recommended by someone I know to even bother . <p> Your points are valid and well taken , its just that for some of us things like portfolios are more trouble than they 're worth . Also , many people have sites for other reasons than getting work . <p> That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it makes sense to follow your advice which I 'd have been able to quote back if your entry was on this page.argh ! ; ) <p> I also do n't  link to any portfolio information because of the maintenance issue . I 've worked on probably over a hundred web sites of the intranet , internet and extranet variety . But take out the intranets and extranets , then take out those URLs that invariably change over time , and then to add new projects every month Its a time consuming process . <p> Besides , its easy to embellish or get the wrong impression as to someones capabilities through their portfolio . Word of mouth is probably still the best approach . And certainly as you continue your business , you 'll build a resource of contractors that you 'll be able to pull into different projects . <p> btw : it was a good idea to mention that you 'd found someone . Youd have no doubt gotten a hundred posts with " hire me ! " : ) <p> I can definitely see the problem with the way most are designed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meant for probably , I can explain the issues that I run into . <p> When your portfolio is not that great , it is hard to be proud about showing it off . Its the old catch 22 . When you are starting out , you need a good portfolio to get good clients , but you need good clients to get that portfolio in the first place . You cant do that with a less than impressive portfolio , so how to begin ? <p> I personally found the best method was offering your service for a lower rate than you know you are worth . If you can really make a client feel like they are getting a deal , then they might be more willing to take the chance one you . Then , use that opportunity to show off your best skill . Then , after you get a couple under your belt , start a portfolio . <p> I started out by showing off screenshots of really amatuer work that I have done , and I am starting to realize this may have not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I consider very high profile for me , so after those are done , I will feel better about my portfolio . <p> I really think everyone could use a " what we do " type page that explains in specific detail just exactly what skill-set the person/company has . Listing technologies and software that you know and giving yourself a rating of how confident you are with each I think gives clients a better idea of who and what you are . <p> A good point . I 'm redesigning my website to be more client-oriented , as it was a combination blog-portfolio before . I 'm keeping them separate this time , mostly because I do n't  feel like I should display a journal of sorts on a client-oriented site . I 'll remember to link to my main site from my blog , though ; ) <p> This has been difficult for me recently because I am a bit new to the whole standards scene . The question is do I display my old nasty table layouts for the world to see , when my site preaches standards compliance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I often hand off control of a site to the client . And sometimes things can get a little ugly . The shell of my work is there , but it looks far different than it did when we went live . <p> The dynamic of the web is so much different than handling calls or face-to-face meetings . In those situations you can respond to questions and concerns , where on the web the potential client is left to fend for themselves . All very scary for a perfectionist <p> So here 's to building a better porfolio . Until then , I will just keep showcasing that Zen Garden Entry for all its worth .

NET developers . It can be as bad as it sounds . Oddly enough , the marketing people have been the most clueful and receptive to using web standards and semantic layout . Our IT department s web administrators are more dogmatic than most Jesuits when it comes to the use of IE , much to my chagrin . <p> However , its taught me an important lesson . Standards compliance does n't  mean anything to the business world . What does matter to them are things like ROI and scalibility .

I 've mentioned that major organizations like Quark , ESPN , Fox Searchlight , and the Library of Congress all have switched to CSS based layouts . I 've made the argument that CSS layouts mean that when mobile devices reign supreme , we wont have to start redesigning pages . I 've shown them the arguments for CSS leading to a better ROI LONG ... Ive designed sites using CSS in days whereas my predecessors tag soup layouts took weeks to design and develop . <p> Does that mean that my company is fully on the standards compliance train ? Unfortunately not . <p> However , they 're starting to get the picture . While I still have to put up with a site filled with tag soup , ugly tables , and absolutely no content management ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some of it is starting to sink in . <p> Standards are going to be a long and hard fight , but that does n't  mean we should give up on them . Yes , well have to use tables from time to time , but this has to be an evolutionary process rather than a revolution process if the suits will understand . <p> If you think like a suit and speak their language , you can sell standards . However , that means that you ca n't be dogmatic either . Table-based layouts may be evil to designers , but they 're still part of the web , and your portfolio should show how you 've developed as a designer . <p> Since Im new to professional design , my portfolio is still under development . Everyone has a different method of delivering their portfolio , but it is definite that everyone should have one . I think the best thing to do is have both screenshots and links to the " real thing . " I had my reasons for not doing so before , but now I am moving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we forget the important aspect of design : CONTENT . I think 3 things need to be established on my site : who I am , what I do , and what I have done . Many times we fail to give the viewer the information that they are looking for , how they are looking for it , and where they are expecting it to be . I think just as we acknowledge the importance of standards-compliant coding , we need to have standards-compliant content similar to 508. 30455 @qwx890455 30451 @qwx890451 <p> You are reading " Positioning your Services " , an entry posted on 7 June , 2004 , to the Arc Flag collection .

@@99593597 @3793597/ <p> " If there 's one adjective to describe a brand new 15 ? Powerbook , slow should not be it . " And so , with those words of wisdom from an Apple tech , I rebuilt my 2-month old system this weekend . <p> What had originally gone wrong , I surmise , is the migration of data and applications from the older iBook . Instead of doing a direct transfer , I was using a GUI interface for the Unix rsync utility called RsyncX which allowed me to perform incremental backups instead of transferring gigs of data every evening as I backed up my system . <p> Sounds good in theory , but where it went wrong was when I originally set up the Powerbook with a different default account name than the iBook . Because rsync preserves permissions ( which are far more important in the world of Unix than in the land of Microsoft ) and the permissions were mapped to the old account , data and settings were inaccessible until I dropped into the Terminal and chmoded my way free . <p> Okay , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But I suspect my fumbling through the data transfer and subsequent repair efforts caused problems that manifested in the following way : a 1.5Ghz G4 felt slower than an 800Mhz G3 with a similar amount of RAM . The system diagnostics CD told me the hardware was fine , so something a little more subtle was happening . <p> After using Windows for ten years I 'm used to using a hammer where a screwdriver is better suited . The old standby when nothing else works is reinstalling your OS from scratch , and since I 'm new enough to Mac ownership that I do n't  yet know a better method , that was my way out . <p> Gritting my teeth and making gratuitous use of my external Firewire drive ( there is nothing greater than blazing transfer speeds ; were talking gigs per minute ) I buckled down to re-partition the hard drive and install a fresh copy of the OS . Two hours of waiting for status bars , clicking the odd button , inserting new CDs , downloading essential third-party apps and I was back up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was before , with the minor exception of my NetNewsWire list . Whoops , forgot to save out my 130-odd subscription . Oh well , at least the important stuff is covered ; its time to find some new sites and prune the cruft anyway . ( side note : if you do n't  have RSS auto-discovery happening on your site , I 'm very annoyed with you at the moment . ) <p> It will be a few days before I know for sure whether this made the difference , but it feels way , way faster already ; enough so that a smile of relief has been plastered on my face all afternoon . Lesson learned : permissions are a cruel mistress . Treat them kindly . 30454 @qwx890454 <p> A hundred and thirty subscriptions ? How do you manage to keep up to date with them ? <p> Thanks for sharing what can go wrong when switching systems . I 'm on my first iBook and I 'm very lucky that I have n't had to do anything drastic to it yet . Like you said with a Windows system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ care . <p> The other option short of a reinstall would be to have used the " Repair Permissions " function of OS Xs Disk Utility application . Itll go through your system directories ( i.e. where permissions are really important ) and set the permissions as they should be . <p> Unfortunately it wo n't do it , I believe , to any partitions that are n't  the boot partition , and it seems to restrict itself to the system directories , but its still rescued me a time or two . <p> ( PHP parse error fixed , for those who noticed it ; my templates screwed up in an entirely different manner this morning . I fixed them , and introduced an unrelated error that I did n't  catch before leaving for the afternoon . Should be golden now . ) <p> 130 subscriptions is n't as hard to maintain as you 'd think . I suspect the average major citys daily newspapers have more verbage than my daily read ; the secret in both cases is to read the stuff that interests you , and ignore the stuff that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sites I read , I 'm not likely to miss major news . Instead of feeling obligated to read each and every little item , I treat the aggregator as a menu and select what I want . <p> " The other option short of a reinstall would be to have used the " Repair Permissions " function " <p> Hmm . Whether I did that or not , I cant remember now I have used it in the past , but I 'm not sure if I did so in this case . In hindsight though , I 'm glad I rebuilt . The difference is night and day , and I 'm feeling much better about the purchase . <p> Does n't  matter what OS you 're running , a clean install will ultimately make for improved performance . I 'm not convinced that its not partially psychological , but you are generally clearing out a lot of detritus that typically scates past the average maintenance regime <p> had similar experience myself recently - which turned out to be bad RAM . Anyway , long and the short of it - if you used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entire hd to a single disk-image , which can then be mounted just like any other disk . This makes restoring s/w as simple as drag/drop , then repair permissions ( if necessary ) . <p> I got my nnw subscriptions back no problems - as well as everything else . <p> Repair permissions can only go so far . No matter what , when migrating to a new machine , it is always best to have a clean install . For data backup , as has already been suggested , utilities like CCC are awesome . There are also many out there with sync features that work just as well . But it is much better to just transfer the files over rather than mess with other methods . Just seems to work smoother IMHO . <p> Glad to hear everything worked out for you though . I am ordering a new pbook here in a week or so , so I am getting excited . <p> For NNW , would n't it be great if it had a sync feature through . Mac or something ? Mark a post @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another machine . And stores all your data on a server , so you never loose it ? I love this about my bookmarks in Safari . Definitely a cool feature that NNW would benefit from I believe . <p> Dave did try the Repair Permissions before reinstallingI suggested it to him when the slowness problem first got annoying . I wonder whether Mac OS X is more susceptible to Windows-like cruft over time than the old Mac OS . Not that I 'd trade back or anything , but when you scratch the lovely surface of Mac OS X , it can be a nasty and complicated beast underneath . <p> There is some satisfaction in a bare-metal reformat and reinstall , however , and its good to do it from time to time if you have good backups . <p> &gt;&gt;&gt;For NNW , would n't it be great if it had a sync feature through .

( And pening selected links in a browser is too jarring a switch , I find . ) <p> I 've done clean installs and drive clones and copies as well . The best has always been clean installs for me . Mainly because the stuff that bogs down my system always seems to be the crazy leftovers in the Library folders from apps of long ago . The clean install takes a LOT longer tho .. Generally its a good 2 days before I 'm back to 100% operating procedures . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good article 1 that went up in the last few weeks . <p> Are there any RSSReaders that will send you directly to the website you have on watch ?

( which i know is the icing , but websites are so much more intimate than , say , mailing lists ) <p> Bloglines will send you directly to the site to read the article that 's the way I use it . You can read the excerpts in the Bloglines interface and then when you want to read the story , you just click on the headline and it takes you to the page . <p> Unless someones site is butt-ugly , I 'm generally clicking over to read their articles . <p> ICK ! ! Re-installs always suck no matter what OS . Any time I have done it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MP3s . At least your OS was functional though to make backups . Hopefully your golden now though ! <p> Using Firefox , you can have the browser notify you when a certain site is updated . All you have to do is go to the bookmark properties and do a schedule and choose how you want to be notified . Seems to work great for most blogs ( except for Xanga ) . <p> Inspired , I decided my Powerbook G4 12 inch was needing a bit of a summer cleaning . After deciding that I did n't  have time for the reinstall route , I used Xupport and ran a few of their maintenence scripts . While these scripts were running I went through my /Library and deleted any unneeded files . Less than an hour later and a restart , I was back up and my OS felt as snappy as a new install . I could n't believe it . So there ya go , my official endorsement for Xupport . <p> PS : I 'm in no way affilliated with developing Xupport , I 'm just a happy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instance as the files are originally owned by someone else . Even though you ( probably ) belong to the same group - admin - it is the safest way to do it as a superuser . <p> Also , it is always a good idea to keep your users on a separate partition . This saves you from having to back everything up . This is how I do it and I am always up and running in an hour ( this includes all the system updates ) . <p> I just bought a 12 " powerbook , so I am essentially having to do a clean reinstall myself . Its a good excercise from time to time , because it forces me to clean up and organize my stuff . <p> My usual routine is to CarbonCopyClone my old install to my backup drive , and copy things over to the new install as needed from there . By CCCing , it allows me to actually boot from the old install if I need to , for instance last night when I too discovered the need to " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how much I plan , there is always something like this on my old install I need access to durin the transition . <p> I 'm doing a clean install upgrade to Panther at work as well , and am employing the same trick . The CCC backup allows me to quickly boot up to my old install , just in case I need to get something out the door really quick and its not working correctly yet on the new install . That allows me to actually do the transition during the week , instead of having to squeeze it in during the off hours . <p> As was mentioned , Macs are quite particular machines . Although they definitely do n't  get as much bunk on them as Windows pcs they are not as seamless and user-friendly as Apple would have us believe . I have a 17 inch powerbook and it has had one re-install already . Although that improves performance it regrettably starts to accumulate garbage right away . <p> My powerbook is my machine of choice , but is n't as fast ( regardless of os ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the biggest thing is actually the fact that my powerbook has a system bus of only 167 mhz . If there are any techniques that would stop garbage from building up I 'd love to know them . <p> Rsync is great for moving and syncronizing , but OS X also makes use of resource forks ( files that are otherwise hidden from the Finder but not the Terminal ) to store additional information that is also needed by the Operating System . Rsync is a unix app , and was n't designed for moving resource forks ( at least not until Tiger , which will natively support it ) , but another unix app called ditto does the trick . Ditto is also what CarbonCopyCloner uses , so for backing up and most system transfers , this is what I would use . Of course , if you switch hardware , nothing beats a fresh install , but I thought I 'd point this out anyway in case you were relying on rsync to back up your user directory moving forward . 30455 @qwx890455 30451 @qwx890451 <p> You are reading " Reboot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to the Polish collection .

@@99593598 @3793598/ <p> Sooner or later you 'll find yourself wondering what the difference is between an accessible web site and one that is n't . <p> The UK Disability Rights Commission has a fantastic demonstration of just a few things that can cause major problems for even the slightly disabled , and I 'd highly recommend checking it out as soon as you have a moment . Three short Flash demonstrations require no more than 3 or 4 minutes , and only one actually pertains to screen readers . 30454 @qwx890454 <p> Great link Dave . Also quite unnerving how easy it is to design from your own perspective . Even if you do allow for accessibility . Judging a site because you like it is one thing , liking it because it works , despite your disabilities , is whole different ball game . The DRCs demonstration is also like walking around with a blindfold for a day so that you can pretend to know what its like , or how about one of those strap-on pregnancy bellies . In the end you gain merely a slither of understanding of what its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got to me . I sat here with my hands on the keys , looking out the window thinking , " okay , technically , I am navigating this page but my god , is this really what they have to put up with ? I would n't even bother . " <p> It would be nice if schools teaching the web would set aside a few sessions for their designers to watch people of varying disabilities struggle their way through existing sites . There 's only so far words can take you , its actual demonstrations like this that clue you in to the relevant issues . <p> This is great ! A quick and easy tool we can turn to when trying to explain to anyone ( the curious , the client , the CEO ) some of the problems people with disabilities encounter on the Web and why our sites should be accessible . Even the accessible design looks OK ! <p> I had a hard enough time trying to find the items with the original design WITHOUT the flying cursor , blurred screen , etc . The colors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that damned 4pt. text that the kids find so cool today made it impossible to read . <p> The key is not convincing CEO/Marketing Manager that the website is inaccessible , the trouble is convincing them that " those people " ( as they often refer to them ) are worth reaching . Personally I think " they " are , but this is a tough sell to most people who have made their way to the top . Its never a " yeah , accessibility is just a decent thing to do " its , " do you have any stats on how many blind people use the web . " Sad . <p> To people with disabilities , speak up ! Please , we ( developers/designers ) want to help you , but you need to make it clear to the marketing wonks that you are a potential customer . We try and try , but they just do n't  believe us . <p> " The key is not convincing CEO/Marketing Manager that the website is inaccessible , the trouble is convincing them that " those people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worth reaching " <p> that 's why i think legislation such as the Disabilities Discrimination Act ( for the UK and - wherever applicable - equivalent legislation in other countries ) are a good thing . it makes convincing the higher-ups a lot easier if you say " you 're breaking the law , and we could face a potentially expensive and damaging ( PR wise ) law suit " <p> US Courts have already ruled that the ADA ( Americans with Disabilities Act ) does not apply to web sites . They did not meet the legal definition of " public place " because the court does not consider them a " place " . <p> I 'm not really sure which side I agree with . I would like to see some legally compelling reason to make sites accessible . On the other hand I would not want myself or a client to get sued because I forgot an alt tag or did n't  make perfectly valid code . <p> I think the best solution all around would be for a disabilities organization to lobby large sites ( in a constructive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approval or certification programs , but these are always construed more as businesses than vehicles of social change . <p> although the screenreader demonstration was meant to ram the point home , i think it should be noted that software such as JAWS provides a selection of far more sophisticated methods for moving around a site than the simple previous-link/next-link method that was simulated , e.g. list all links ( which you can then sort and rearrange by different criteria ) , list all heading , move to next heading at same level , move to first form field ( in a form , obviously ) , etc of course , this is not a substitute for accessibly designed and structured webpagesi just wanted to ensure that people here do n't  think that all screenreaders do is let you tab between links and read out what 's there ; ) <p> " How fitting that a demonstration on inaccessibility is done in Flash ; " <p> the fact that its in flash in not the problem ( as it needs to be a simulation of how different users may perceive a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like flash/shockwave/java ) the fact that there is no londesc ( e.g. " this flash movie simulates how a user with a mobility impairment , having difficulty using a mouse , may experience the inaccessible demonstration site . mouse movements within this flash movie are exagerated , increasing the difficulty for the user to accurately position the mouse pointer over a link to select it " or something like that ) <p> well , apparently the DDA ( following the publication of a governmental code of practice ) does now seem to officially apply to web sites/services in the UK ( although were still " anxiously " awaiting a test case ) . thing is , in most - if not all - cases , any dispute wont automatically result in a hefty fine or even a court case . there will be a chance to make reasonable changes to a site in order to avoid a case ever being followed through . even in the famous Sydney Olympics case ( SOCOG ) the organising committee had the chance to change their site to ensure at least a baseline level @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considerations ( as the lifespan of the site was pretty much limited to the duration of the games ) , they decided not to make the changes and instead simply pay the fine and be done with it <p> FWIW , I personally am against the " try it for a day " approach to disability awareness Some studies ( do n't  have them handy , but can find if anyone is interested ) show that instead of opening minds to the various disability experience , it creates a bit of a " poor them " attitude . As Dave said : " but my god , is this really what they have to put up with ? " . <p> As redux pointed out , real screen readers offer more options , and a person using this software day in/day out will have a familiarity with it that can blow your mind ( a friend of mine has his set on such a rapid read rate that I ca n't figure out what 's said , but he s not missing a thing ) . <p> While sitting in a wheelchair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can give you a very faint idea , you can not experience the " real thing " with just sitting in the chair a few times . Heck , I have *fun* wheeling around ( especially with my new wheels http : **26;2479;TOOLONG ) . Its not dreary and desperate all the time . Its just one more aspect of my life . <p> So it is difficult for someone not having a disability to really judge what its like , and a momentary thing can only give you a glimpse . <p> The site is good in that it gives an idea of a barrier . But remember , do n't  judge the whole thing based on your perception of it . You do n't  have the day to day experience , you have n't developped your own " hacks " to handle situations . <p> I 'm not saying not to build accessible Just pointing out you 're only seeing the tip of the iceberg <p> In reply to Eric Savage , some clarification is in order .

Seeing so many errors on one page is a blow to ones psyche , and when they do n't  realize that all 52 can be eliminated with the addition of four bytes to their code , it can make the difference between sticking it out until validation is achieved , and turning their back on valid markup because its just too hard . <p> update:Zeldman has pointed out that the validation services are maintained by a small , unpaid and underappreciated staff of volunteers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Its not fair of me to point out the shortcomings of a group that is doing so much with so little , especially out of my own ignorance , so Ive toned down the original post .

Theyve asked for help from the community : <p> Another issue I have with validators is that if I have content pulled in via PHP and mySQL , which I almost always do . I cant validate that page . I have to actually go to the page in a browser , save the source as a file and then validate that file .

@@99593600 @3793600/ <p> If you do n't  have thick skin before doing work for a high profile organization with fans who are very opinionated , you develop it in a hurry . The response has been great , but there are still points to be addressed . <h> Branding <p> A big one . What happened was I got asked to put some thought into that , but because of a restricted timeline I could n't explore it as much as I would have liked . There are plans to spend some quality time on this in the next few months , but it could n't happen all at once so I did two things . <p> First , I decided we would n't try a paradigm shift just yet . Colours were culled from the existing site , logos were tweaked rather than redesigned , and the only thing I really contributed that was completely new was a bug image for Bugzilla . Anything but the hideous devil chip that exists now . <p> Second , I worked on a new treatment of the logo which , by most accounts is n't right . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treatment . Most did n't  even notice the typeface swap , and those that did liked it . It felt wrong dropping a floating dino head in a white area , so the black box was conceived out of necessity . Chances are that both will be scrapped in the end , but its something for now . <h> Layout <p> There are a few things that are problematic here , and again I 'll have to defer to the restricted timeline . Most pages are full-screen , but the home page is constrained to a hard pixel width . This , if you can believe it , was because I could n't figure out the necessary CSS in time . Its the only way I got it working across all platforms consistently , although now I 'm finding there 's a bug in Konqueror anyway . <p> The main header is a little light on functionality . There was more that should have gone into it , but the focus changed as we developed . I originally designed for a more portal-like site with different search options , a font switcher , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Well , I thought I did a hell of a job here with my extraneous titles and skip nav links and relative fonts sizes and such , but it appears 90% does n't  exempt one from criticism . What 's being discussed is how much we should defer to a users settings , and allow their preferences to prevail . Particularily , no specifying of underlining or not underlining links ( an issue I will happily concede ) and no specifying of a default font size ( one which I wo n't ) . <h> Markup &amp; Validation <p> Content was frequently copied &amp; pasted from older documents , so a lot of pages will spit out errors . My templates were okay , so well have to blame the content here . There are a lot of pages to retro-fit , so this is n't going away any time soon . <p> As well , the whole XHTML 1.0 and MIME type issue has reared its ugly head . I debated what to do about this at the beginning , and in the end I think chose wrong . HTML 4.01 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other reason than to quiet the pedants . <h> Conclusions <p> It was tough work , and its definitely not over . Reactions have been great , and those that havent were ( mostly ) constructive and useful . Obviously you cant please everyone , but a lot of the basics have been covered . <p> I had about two weeks to throw design and code together . The project started last month , and my initial deadlines were ultra-tight . My involvement was strictly voluntary , and I 've kept my standards as high as they are when building commercial work , but I did n't  get everything right . Which is n't to say that I got most things wrong , but to explain that I ca n't be everywhere at once . <p> There are things you would do differently . There are things I would do differently !

@@99593601 @3793601/ <p> A recent find has been making parts of my life easier : OmniGraffle , a diagramming tool which comes bundled with the latest Macs . <p> Though I 'm probably the last OS X user on the planet to try them out , I figured I owed it to myself to take a spin through some of the free software that came with the new Powerbook I picked up last month . There are some real gems bundled , including the Art Directors Toolkit , the iLife suite , and a few applications from the Omni Group . <p> OmniGraffle is a diagramming and charting tool that 's simple , elegant , and easy to use . I was building my first for-production-use chart within a minute of starting up and clicking around for the first time . The various stylistic graphics for technical and business purposes mean dragging and dropping your way to a useful flowchart is a snap . <p> As soon as I got to the Garrett IA chart items , the natural reaction was to start plotting this sites current setup . And some interesting things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but has always been somewhat peripheral to me ; the processes and information flows around here were developed unconsciously and intuitively . While this is n't a terrible method for someone who uses the web daily and understands a lot of what not to do , a more formal plan of attack cant hurt , can it ? <p> Its not a perfect tool , since the connecting lines can be sticky at times . There are countless things I 'd change about the styling palette , and I find it odd that I cant easily change a graphic after it has been set ; perhaps answers will come after more use . Still , its an interesting little program , and a great addition to the toolbox . 30454 @qwx890454 <p> Ive feel the same way about this great little app . I find it useful and I really love how easy it is to use , I just never find myself actually using it ; - ) . <p> I have used it to layout a recent web project and it did help to more simply define and direct the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more goodies and would be worth a look as 2.0 ships with most of the PowerBooks now . <p> AWESOME ! Now , if only theyd release a version for Windows , I 'd be over the moon . <p> I would have thought you 'd be all about IA . In my mind , its almost a cornerstone of good design . My understanding is that ad hoc architecture ( intuitive , organic ) works great for the architect , less great for everyone else . A lot of sites are designed around how the **26;2507;TOOLONG organize the information , which is not necessarily the same way that makes sense to site visitors . Interestingly , the same problem exists in identity design . <p> I love OmniGraffle as well . Ive been using it for school related projects ( data structures , gantt charts , pert diagrams ) because its quicker than Illustrator and easier to use and change things . I 've yet to use it on a paying gig , but I plan to on my current project . Thanks for the Garrett link , I shall go over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrong , a lot of the time its a part of my design process but its not formal with big charts and in-depth thinking and stuff . Its more scratchings on a notepad , and adjusting on the fly . In other words , I 'm a terribly amateur IA practitioner , but I DO pratice . <p> I found OmniGraffle at a good time , when Im interested in learning more about the formal processes . <p> The feature of OG that sucked me in fastest was the integration with OmniOutliner - say you create a site map in OO and save it to disk . You can then import it into OG and itll be automatically object-ized for you . <p> I have n't tried this trick with the Garrett visual vocabulary yet , though - I only discovered that while playing around on Wednesday . <p> Another incredibly nice thing about OmniGraffle is that they offer unlimited one-day Trial Licenses . If you 're a cheap bastard , you can get a fresh one every day and they not only do n't  mind , they actually encourage it . I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If anything , it makes me *more* eager to pay for the app , which is probably the intended effect . <p> If you want to change a shape after you 've created it , just select the shape you want , then go to the Shape menu and select the shape you want it to change to . You 'll notice that much of OmniGraffles menus work when you 've got a shape selected and want to affect a change . Its a wonderful application and together with OmniOutliner , makes creating diagrams a breeze . As mentioned earlier , you can import OmniOutliner files into OmniGraffle . You can also set your preferences in OmniGraffle as to how to specifically import the OmniOutliner files . Its really powerful . <p> Ive been using OmniGraffle for so long Ive become more fluid brainstorming on it over the traditional pen-on-napkin . I 've used it for flowcharts , design layout , hierarchies , interface design , etc . Its definitely worth the price ! <p> Welcome to the club ! Ive been using OmniGraffle for a while now and I also love it - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for web layout design ! ( Ive never been a fan of Photoshop layouting ) . <p> If you have n't tried it : go get the demo and the free one-day licence ! <p> Interesting . Many people of an artistic bent believe that formality and process is an impediment to creativity . I think that 's half-right - I 'd say that imposed formality and process is an impediment to creativity . Despite the professed allegiance to complete freedom and lack of rules , in reality , most artists limit themselves to certain kinds of expression . To me , art is not so much thinking outside of the box as creating ones own box , ones own framework of rules and process , even if that framework incorporates spontaneity . <p> Once one realizes that , its a simple step to notice that even complete obedience to a rigid set of parameters is a type of freedom if it is self-imposed . <p> A few notes unless theyve just changed , Apple only ships v2 of OG . Go get v3 right now ! Its a big improvement , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the also have a Pro version which works w/ Visio files ! Special prices for peeps who get a version on their Apple bundled . Do n't  walk , run , its good stuff ! <p> Yeah .. but do n't  inadvertently invalidate an industry best-in-class business standard because its not produced by a cool company . Microsoft bought Visio from another company . <p> Visio is one of the *best* software for creating schematic wireframes , sitemaps , screen and process flows and allows exportation into several file formats to allow collaboration . <p> A competive User Experience designer should not be without this valuable productivity tool . I 'm happy to hear that the latest version of OG works with Visio file formats because it will make cross platform collaboration more successful . <p> It is a shame that there is not a Windows version of it . I 'm a ( business ) consultant type and I use diagrams or sketches of processes a lot to illustrate my powerpoint slides , and unlike Visio the OG output looks smart with the dropshadows and semitransparant colours . <p> At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the end compatibility issues made me drop OG for use . Which is a shame : making a Visio diagram look good is far more work . <p> ( OG combined with a Wacom tablet is a wonderful production boost I can tell : drawing diagrams is a breeze ) <p> I became a huge fan on OmniGraffle not long after I got my Mac a couple years ago . I was amazed at its ease of use after using Visio for years , I could knock out what was in my head in OG in 15 to 20 minutes where Visio would take me an hour . I often use OG to visualize ideas I am playing with and it easily makes graphics and PDFs that can be dropped into other apps . I work in a Windows environment and I will often wait until I get home to knock out an idea or graphic in a few mintues that I know would take far longer during the day using Visio . <p> Since OG is vector based I can make graphics for presentations and drop them in Keynote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It looks like it was always part of the presentation and designed professionally . <p> I am also a huge fan of OmniOutliner between OO and OG I do most of my thinking . I wish OO would have an export to Wiki formatting as that would save me a ton of time . OO is great for fleshing out ideas . It imports seamlessly into Keynote ( PowerPoint with out the user swearing ) and back into OO from Keynote . <p> It all depends on how you think best , but these tools are great tools for me to get my thought out so I can development them and share them . <p> The first app I learned on the Mac in 1987 was a little outliner call More LONG ... fast forward to the year 2000 and I rediscovered outlines with Brainforest on my Handspring . When I move from OS 9 to OS X , I fell in love with the apps from OmniGroup . <p> Ever since , I cant do anything without sketching idea/text in Outliner , graphing everything in Graffle . Basically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years started in one form or the other in an app from OmniGroup . <p> I find that the two must useful palette in Graffle are : 1 - Selection and Style 2 - Alignment If you use them both ( with the paintbrush button ) , your graphic are hard to mess up . <p> Graffle and Outliner have pretty much become indespensible tools for me over the past year . I 'd like to second the earlier comment about Graffle 3 Pro . Not only does it add Visio XML file compatibility , but it also allows for multi-page diagrams that 's something that 's really crucial when you 're diagramming a fairly large site . <p> Ive used Visio extensively in the past and I have to say that working in Graffle feels like much less of a battle . <p> Also , the last time I checked Omni offered substantial discounts for members of mac users groups . If you 're thinking about buying and you 're in a MUG this might be worth looking into . <p> Isnt it interesting how no one is screeming amerature for using the default app @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do so much as hint at such a thing with Windows , his reputation would come into question . Sure , as others point out , MS offers a competitive product , but for a price . ( This is not meant as MS bashing but just an inocent observation ) <p> All we see here are a bunch for yeah , is n't it great comments and a few I want that for my OS comments . Makes me wonder if maybe I should make the switch myself . Its been probably 10 years ( the time Ive been out of school ) since Ive even used a Mac , mostly because the price has scared me away . But then again , you do often get what you pay for . <p> I guess this is another one of those I want that for my OS comments . <p> Just a quick warning if you 're thinking the pro version will solve your cross platform issues with its Visio compatibility . I love OG , but it does not do very well with Visio files . My pro version @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but I found it pretty much unusable for production work . I could open Visio files and tell what it generally was to look like , but that 's about it . It is not cross platform compatable like MS Office for the Mac and MS Office for the PC are ( same company in that case , so I suppose we should expect that ) . 30455 @qwx890455 30451 @qwx890451 <p> You are reading " IA with OmniGraffle " , an entry posted on 25 June , 2004 , to the Arc Flag collection .

Just today I posted about a very similar situation that did n't  go quite so well : 
@@99593604 @3793604/ <p> The above two links will take you to some interesting numbers , although nothing you have n't seen before . IE has enjoyed a majority position in the browser market for what 's going on 3 years now , and the new wave of standardscompliant browsers are barely making a scratch . <p> Is this really much of a surprise to anyone ? Let 's think about how Microsoft pulled this off : IE came bundled with Windows so that your new computer had a browser right from the getgo . The more technologically advanced of us had the option of upgrading , but we will always be a small minority . The path of least resistance in getting on the internet was and is to use the default browser , which is exactly why Microsoft won the last round , and why IE is n't going anywhere . <p> And we should n't forget about how many of us were cheering them on back then , too . What was the alternative ? The oftderided Netscape Navigator 4 , which was obsolete almost as soon as it was released . Then it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyone in their right mind could believe it . Even today traces of its odour still linger like recently disposed fish gut . <p> So weve come full circle . We were ecstatic to see something better than NN4 replace it , now were beginning to hope against hope that something will replace its replacement . " IE is the new NN4 . " I 've heard it more than once . <p> Given the great new browsers in the past year from the Mozilla project , Apple , and Opera , we are finally getting the standards support we 've been aching for ; but is it doing us any good at all if the rest of the world ignores them ? Were trying to hit a moving target , and they ai n't  cooperating . <p> What 's it going to take to move to the next level ? Short of a revolutionary change in technology or mindset , not only are we stuck with the most popular browser vendor dragging its heels on a new release , but were also faced with a user base that sees no reason to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unqualified success in eliminating the remaining few percentage of NN4 users , but will they have to start it up all over again once we see IE7 ? <p> Tantek elik posts that MSN for OS X came out Thursday with a huge update to the Mac IE5 rendering engine , Tasman . That 's a glimmer of hope that something might be around the corner from Redmond for IE itself , but will even that be enough ? What if no one upgrades ? <p> This is why I find it hard to salivate over the new offerings of CSS3 , and why I ca n't be bothered to care about the tiny or major differences between XHTML 2.0 and 1.1 . Were not going to be in a position to actually use either of those for a very long time yet . <p> Its great to have new browser releases to keep the market fresh ; it proves that there 's hope for the future . But for right now ? There 's no point in lamenting the most esoteric CSS2 selectors wo n't work in any browser but Mozilla . Instead I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and CSS1 and see how far I can go with the tools I have now . Come along for the ride , itll be more fun . 30454 @qwx890454 <p> I , too , have been feeling that way lately time to drop the training wheels and hope for the best . I 'm sick of writing code that I know is obsolete just because the majority of the Internet users do n't  know what they 're doing ( or what they 're missing ) . Glad to see that someone whose opinion is qualified feels the same way . I 'm squeaking along right behind you . <p> That 's all well and good for blogs and personal sites - but I think the days of " Best viewed with " are long gone . How do you tell a client that you want to design for 2% of the browsers out there and leave everyone else hanging ? <p> Maybe I 'm just extra sensitive to this issue because where I work 65% of the users on my intranet are using Netscape 4 ( and half of those are using a version of Solaris @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the spec just ai n't  enough . Yes , I validate , but its getting harder and harder to convince myself that its worth it when I spend hours figuring out that " margin : -8px " is a valid way of expressing " leftmargin=0 " in Netscape while my coworkers write tag soup and nobodys the wiser . <p> I 've decided that NN4 can go hang - somedays I feel the same about IE6 as well , when I spend a day working up code using Camino and then discover that IE6 mangles it by introduces extra margins , or deciding that paragraph margins are n't  necessary , &amp;c . Its not so bad , but I wish it would " just work " , like coding for Moz seems to . <p> My other big beef is PNG support , which I feel is really holding us back ( would be great for the garden ! ) I feel bad for you if you must code for NN4 , I 'd hate to go back to using tables myself . <p> Jemal - you design for your audience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of your users are still to this day running NN4 , its an exercise in masochism to drop tables . In a more general , internet-wide sense though , those supporting that far back are pretty much making a last stand , given how much more you can do once you drop it . <p> Alternatively , if you 're itching to work on your CSS skills while waiting for these guys to get a clue and upgrade their browser/OS , there 's no shame in transitional layouts . I 've actually put together a few CSS-only layouts that shift a little bit in NN4 ( background images get stuck in the top left corner , rather than bottom right , so I change my image accordingly , for example ) that seem to turn out okay , but I 've also thrown together sites with one or two main tables that degrade pretty gracefully . <p> In the grand scheme of things though , its almost pointless to do that anymore for most regular sites . You do n't  code for 2% of the population and leave everyone else hanging , which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ missing out on providing the best possible experience for the majority of the population . IE5/IE6 is at 93% , Mozilla can be anywhere from 2 to 5% depending on your audience ( mine is around 33% , but my traffic is far from an accurate indicator of the regular user ) , and NN4 is 1% or less . Its safe to say that CSS-based design is a preferable alternative today . Faster download times , easier maintenance , and all the other reasons for using it are something to embrace , not avoid . <p> Mike , you 're killing yourself if you design in a Mozilla browser and then test in IE. I do all my testing in IE first , then make appropriate changes to accomodate Mozilla afterward . Its almost always far easier to make fixes in Mozilla , because you usually know exactly why an element is out of place . " Oh , my text-align : right ; moved that DIV over in IE , but its still flush left in Mozilla . Of course , Mozilla only applies text-align to text . Adjust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ support would be nice , agreed . But for the time being I 'm making due . Creative use of GIF transparency ( making sure to dither to the proper matte colour naturally ) and precise placement of JPG background images can usually accomplish the same opacity effects that PNG offers , even if they 're somewhat faked . It feels like a hack , but at least it works . <p> Incidentally , have you seen this story on ALA ? Its too much work for me to have used seriously yet , but its a possible way out for you . <p> Mike , you 're killing yourself if you design in a Mozilla browser and then test in IE. I do all my testing in IE first , then make appropriate changes to accomodate Mozilla afterward . <p> Well , I work on a Mac , so IE Mac was OK two years ago but Moz based browsers like Camino are the way to go now - and IE Mac behaves quite differently from IE 6 anyway . I generally look at pages in Virtual PC to get a sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work . As an aside , apparently MS has incorporated some new code into their new MSN Mac client , so perhaps well see some improvements to IE Mac finally . <p> I 've basically incorporated most of the bad IE bugs into my work habits now too - for example paragraphs get padded instead of their parent divs . As well , I try to leave things as flexible as possible to accomodate those mysterious extra pixels that IE likes to put in occasionally . <p> re : PNG article - yes I have seen that one and I agree , its a little too much work with too many caveats . Another link is PNG Behaviour , a free set-up for using PNGs in your HTML documents , which is considerably easier to use - but does n't  fix background images .

Which is a bit annoying to me , and often left me puzzled . <p> Andrew - that 's actually an excellent point . I had n't  thought of quite doing it like that ; Clements HoriZental has a French equivalent that I was going to hack into the source somehow . Your way makes way more sense . <p> Jan - you 're right in that AccessKeys on the Garden itself are useless . I originally implemented them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the code ; making it as useful as possible as a learning tool is my goal . Of course now I 'm finding that AccessKeys are mostly a pain anyway , due to breaking existing shortcuts ( your ALT+D is a perfect example - I hate that ) 30455 @qwx890455 30451 @qwx890451 <p> You are reading " Garden Update " , an entry posted on 20 October , 2003 , to the No 1 collection .

Design <p> June 05 , 2003 8PM PST <p> Why coding and design do n't  mix , and news of two new Zen Garden submissions . <p> Time for a breather , I think . <p> The focus on browsers lately has been good for thinking about what 's important for users and developers , and what lies ahead , but you can only prattle on so much before realizing its just an intellectual discussion . While the technology may change , its only a means to an end and what really counts is how you use it . Moving on to another subject near and dear to my heart : design . <p> I recently did an interview for zlog in which I stated that coding is counterintuitive to a designer ( and I just noticed that Ronan has a new one posted with Ben Hammersley I 'm in good company . ) <p> Scott Steffens posted a thoughtful response to the interview that bears consideration . He argues that the designer is the best person to plan the layout and interaction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ designer who does n't  know the code ca n't possibly know what is or is n't possible to achieve . <p> I believe to a certain degree , he s right . When designing for a technological medium , you have to consider the technology and make sure you understand its strengths and limitations . <p> This holds true for any medium if you paint a picture with oil paints , you study concepts like fat over lean and get used to working with malleable paint that does n't  dry for days or weeks . If you do n't  know any of this going in , and all you 've used in the past are watercolours , you will quickly get frustrated in your efforts . The result wont be pretty . Different methods of creation have their strengths and weaknesses , you need to know what they are before you can use them effectively . <p> But the problem , jumping back to the coding focus , is when you start adapting your layout to fit a design you know you can code . The tools are getting in the way of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laborious process of chopping up images for each cell , then tediously aligning them row by row and adding up colspans and the like is a very mechanical process . Tools are available that allow a designer to accomplish almost anything they need to with these methods . A good handle on the code will only improve this process , and while there are surely layouts that can not be handled effectively through these automatic tools , for many purposes they get you 80 or 90% of the way there . <p> The remaining few percent is what will distinguish a good web designer from a pixeljockey . The former understands relative font sizing , window scaling , and clean code . The latter cares more about the visuals and can satisfactorily call their work complete without ever having to touch that last 10% . Some will say that 's good enough , others will deride them for leaving the job unfinished . <p> Currently no such choice exists for CSSbased design . Which , some argue , is a good thing because it prevents those who fall into the latter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd argue , is precisely why a project like the Zen Garden was necessary , to show the latter category what they 're missing out on . <p> Having a visual CSS editor is n't going to make the world a better place . It will enable people who code improperly to continue doing so . It still wo n't make better designers of the coders using CSS now . But it will make life easier for people who wish to have it both ways . <p> And speaking of design , do not miss the two excellent new Zen Garden submissions : " Wrapped in Burlap " by John Simons and " What Lies Beneath " by Micheal Pick . You may remember Mikes previous submission , " Dead or Alive " . These two designs are phenomenally creative examples of how radically different the same designer can approach the same problem . There 's some incredible talent in this one , and if you 're in the New York area , do peruse his portfolio . 30451 @qwx890451 <p> You are reading " Coding vs .

@@99593609 @3793609/ <p> What all this is about : XUL , or XML User Interface Language was developed by Mozilla as an XML-based language for web applications . More simply , what XHTML does for web pages , XUL does for web applications . And this is all very important , largely because of the XML foundation and the implications for business . <p> Now what Microsoft has done is effectively developed their own version of XUL for Internet Explorer , which they 're calling XAML . Remember the browser wars ? Remember custom-coding DHTML libraries for two different platforms ? Remember how ridiculously redundant that was even in an era when people had a stupidly casual ability to throw around bags of cash ? It wo n't happen again . <p> The operating system lock-in created and perpetuates the browser lock-in . Now the browser will give that extra boost to the OS . " Our application only works on Windows , using IE. No , sorry , extra development costs are too much . You 'll just have to use a Windows desktop . " <p> Apple has a tremendous amount of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and compete against an OS that was released two years ago tomorrow . If they embrace a development platform like XUL and actually make inroads with the customers who will be deploying applications using it , will it be enough ? <p> All this can be somewhat negated by the opportunity that exists for Microsoft to play fair . If , as Simon postulates , XAML can be transformed server-side to XUL ( using XSLT ) , then we all win . But Eric remembers his history , which suggests we should n't rely on that happening . Ill throw this into the ring then : even if its possible , will it be cost-effective ? For organizations to spend an extra 20% of a development budget to support a 3% share of the market is a bit of a stretch . But its obviously do-able , seeing as how many still bend over backward for NN4.x . <p> The end result is still anyones guess . A lot can happen in three years . This is an encouraging step forward for the web in general ; at least the current @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the final outcome means an impenetrable hegemony is unclear . The only for sure thing is that the web landscape in 2008 will be radically different than what we see now . <p> Regardless of the wisdom , necessity , or desirability of this premise ( or lack thereof ) , it would not necessarily solve THIS issue . <p> Microsofts web strategy is working only because it is ALLOWED to work . Companies ( and individuals ) will do anything they think is in their own best interest , so long as no one with the power to stop them says " no " . Microsoft is the biggest gorilla in the business world , has monopoly power in the desktop market , and is once again attempting to leverage that power to dominate other markets and destroy rivals . <p> Microsoft is so big and so powerful that there are only two entities with the power to effectively say " no " to them : the governments of the US and the EU . The US has not shown much inclination to enforce its own anti-trust laws , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the force of Microsoft . If either would place real , enforceable strictures on the way Microsoft uses its monopoly power ( in this case , perhaps giving official backing to W3C standards once theyve become ratified and MANDATING their usage for applications used by governmental bodies - with real enforcement power and penalties to back it up ) , it would curb SOME of the attempts by Microsoft to control the internet . <p> THAT is what we truly need : a system where people are free to use whatever browser on whatever platform they want , and have confidence they will get the same user experience regardless of the choice they make because the same standards are used everywhere . <p> Government laws regarding accessibility should have a fail-safe for situations like this . The W3C should be granted official recognition , and should be made arbiter over web standards and XML ( not federally funded or staffed , however ) . Then , companies which release browsers , especially with such influence as Internet Explorer , should be required to fulfill the W3C recommendations with the penalty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across content it can not parse ( due to lack of support for the standard ) . <p> Further , corporations that run websites should be discouraged from using proprietary serving functions that are meant to be viewed by the general public . They should be encouraged to use standardized protocols and recommendations . <p> This is all a pipe dream , but it would force Microsoft to either die or comply . <p> Then again , I 'm no expert on law ( even accessibility law ) or civics , so much of what I said may not be thought out thoroughly , but its a suggested solution . <p> dris , good point about accessibilitybut here 's a thought : what if MS simply create something that they claim is so revolutionary that it ca n't be called " the web " anymore ? similar to the leap between radio and television , they could n't be forced to make it backwards compatibleits a completely different beast , hence you cant listen to the audio portion of tv broadcasts on radio . just playing devils advocate <p> Lots of folks betting on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my view . IEs javascript is impoverished with a crippled event system compared to the w3c standard ( and Mozilla ) . Sure , you might be able to translate the UI and get a well behaved tree widget in xul and msblahxml , but what good does it do you if the logic and glue do n't  translate ? <p> " There are other alternatives to Redmond for x86 and they are every bit as functional as OS X and you can make them look just as good . Granted , it does take a bit more work , but its worth it . " <p> While technically possible , getting Linux to look and work as well as OSX is n't feasible . There is n't any Linux distro anywhere near the polish OSX has . Nor is there an applications suite that compares to Apples iTools programs . <p> Plus , OSX can run things like Dreamweaver and Photoshop natively , no WINE required . <p> dris , i doubt that MS would be so innovative as wellwhat i meant ( and cunningly forgot to write in my previous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the web , AND provide client software that connects to this closed system ( yes , much in a similar way to the AOL model , as something separate from the web of today ) . as long as their client software is accessible , their standard could remain as closed as they want ( in the same way that their OS needs to comply to accessibility rules , but they do n't  have to distribute the Windows source code as a free , open commodity ) . <p> Well , Patrick , I highly doubt that Microsoft is capable of innovating such a thing as a " new web " , but I digress . <p> If that were the case , accessibility laws would n't apply to the new medium . And , as with any new medium , experimentation must take place to allow for it to flourish . <p> Whatever the case , the government should soon organize a standardization organization ( no rhyme intended ) which would have the same arbitration responsibilities as the W3C has for the web . Same thing would apply , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from scratch . <p> Indeed , no for-profit organization should have complete control over the protocol of a medium , for the same reasons that a company should n't have sole power over the distribution and sales of an entire industry . <p> Of course , this would n't apply if Microsoft were to release it as a Microsoft proprietary product , similar to the way AOL has their own online content separate from the web . However , doing that would steal content from the new technology , and it would probably flop . Even Microsoft could see that , I 'm sure . <p> To summarize , the same rules would apply ; they would just be rewritten to apply to the medium , and a different organization would form the standards . 
@@99593610 @3793610/ <h> A Design Review <p> I do n't  know what the official contest policy is on the original designers re-using these , but Patrick H. Laukes example design Gothic found its way into the Zen Garden as Gothica so I 'm inclined to think itll be alright . <p> That being said , Ray Henry with his fabulous reh3 and even more fabulous Deadend Prophecy had better get in touch with me after the results are in . That is , if , for some very very strange reason he does n't  sweep the contest . You may remember Rays existing Zen Garden design Backyard . Beautiful work , all three . <h> A Technical Review <p> With any luck , you have n't noticed : I 've been doing a lot of tweaking under the hood around here , and I think its about time to mention a few things . <p> I 'm now employing Pixys absolutely brilliant CSS rollovers on the right . Where before there was a slight blink as the image loaded upon first mouseover , now there 's a completely seamless transition . <p> 5.0 browsers should handle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a problem , but there are still a few tiny little quirks yet . IE5/Mac was a complete disaster , and thanks to some help from Alicia Lane ( and a gentle nudge to actually do something about it ) , I 've sanitized the majority of the blast radius . There are still problems , but at the very least its somewhat usable now . <p> Search is ( finally ) coming . I have to do some major work on the templates , but I 've got the functionality started . Now to figure out where to put it . <p> Cynthia Says thinks my front page passes all the major checkpoints for AAA . Bobby does n't  . I know there are still outstanding issues regardless , and a good read-through of WCAG is going to help me fix them , but I 'm moving in the right direction . <p> It should be noted that the errors reported by Bobby are questionable : <p> Do not use the same link phrase more than once when the links point to different URLs . As Ken Walker has recently discovered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be possible to provide a title for each link and satisfy this requirement . That does n't  work . <p> Make sure event handlers do not require use of a mouse . Well this is just plain silly . There 's not an iota of script on my front page . <p> Cynthia gets them right . However , since those of us who spend the time doing it right like to make mention of it , Cynthias inability to directly link validation results for any given site continues to be a problem . There 's a very important point that should be made in here about not trusting software anyway since the guidelines need a human eye for complete validation , but I 'm getting verbose as it is . <p> After publishing a piece on bulletproof XHTML , I obviously had to start thinking about the issue myself . You might be pleased to note that most pages on this site , including the comments pages are validating . The current plan is to flip the switch and trigger XML rendering mode in a few weeks , after I 've had time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ error-correcting working properly . There will be a follow-up piece on how I went about it at that time . <p> Up until now I was marking up all my &lt;acronym&gt;s by hand . Thanks to Brad Choates plugins and Mark Pilgrims macros , I do n't  need to anymore . Interesting note about the use of abbreviations on a page : WCAG suggests providing a title for an **28;2535;TOOLONG when it first occurs in the document . It does n't  say you cant do the same for other occurances , but it suggests you do n't  need to . <p> No problem , that 's the exact behaviour of the plugin . But it begs the question even though I 'm not applying titles to repetitions , do I need to markup the rest of the occurances with the proper tags ? My gut feeling is that I do , but the plugin does n't  allow that . So I 'm at an impasse here : More work for me , vs. proper semantics . Hmmm . <p> And yes , I know the difference between &lt;acronym&gt; and &lt;abbr&gt; , and no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ End of question . <p> If you 've made it through all that , my final point is that this site still looks the same as it did last week . Ever get the feeling that sometimes you have to wear too many hats ? <p> Yes , it is true that we are introducing semantically meaningless mark-up , however , IMHO , semantically meaningless mark-up is preferable to using semantically incorrect mark-up . <p> In a real-world sense it does n't  really make a difference that you are marking up abbreviations incorrectly ( in 2003 ) but assuming that one of your goals is to " future-proof " this site , who can really say how the " browsers of tomorrow " will interpret the tag . Abbreviations should be spelled-out while acronymns read-out , right ? <p> Note : I am just playing " devils advocate " ( hypocrite ) here , as I also use the ACRONYM tag for everything on my site ; ) <p> I find constant use of the acronym and abbr tags annoying . Use them for the first occurrence of each term and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what they mean , so the extra underlined text just muddies up your paragraphs . Those who do n't  know what they mean can read the title the first time , and then they know . <p> Think of it too just like in a newspaper article or movie review : " Bruce Wayne ( Michael Keaton ) is a billionaire playboy by day and Batman by night " - you do n't  keep reminding your readers that Michael Keaton plays the part , you just do it it once . The Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) had this to say " - the first time you use the term you provide the acronym , and then you just use the acronym from then on . <p> Believe it or not , I think that Bobbys making a stink over the &lt;a&gt; tag list item that comes immediately before your linked header . I had this come up , ironically , in the Section 508 entry . Bobby interprets whitespace as anything ( carriage returns , spaces , combinations thereof , etc. ) between two &lt;a&gt; tags , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other is in a header . Kinda silly . My workaround for this issue was to put a small dot ( + ) around my " posted " links to seperate them from the blog content . <p> Character Entities ( spaces introduced , as I do n't  know how theyll show up ) . <p> I do n't  know what Safari does n't  like about your changes , Dave , but it now shows your last two section icons as : <p> &amp; sect ; <p> rather than displaying the character . I guess it would prefer &amp; #167 ; <p> I had thought entity " names " were only a problem for it in XML parsing mode but apparently not . However , it handles the section-sign entities in the comments section OK . Nevertheless , in Ethans comment I get : <p> &amp; mdash ; <p> rather than an em-dash ( &amp; #8212 ; ) <p> Let me add : this is not a complaint about your wonderful site of any sort . I just thought it was interesting . <p> Anne : " Acronyms are always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and do n't  code to a browser " <p> True . As well , these " browsers of tomorrow " may have unique default behaviours when encountering unstyled ACRONYMS and ABBR tags , so it definitely makes sense to use them correctly , as CSS may be turned off/unavailable in the device . <p> Jacques - despite some frequent Googling on the subject , I was n't aware of that plugin . Dammit all anyway . <p> Anne - " And you should make distinction and do n't  code to a browser . " Yes , you 're right , we should n't . But here 's where real-world and theory diverge . IE5/6 is still run by 90% of the population last time I checked ; we throw box model hacks in our CSS , and so we also use acronym . Theory is nice only so far as it does n't  break expected behaviour for the *majority* of your audience . <p> Michael - not Safari : bad macros . I have no idea why , but it keeps flipping back and forth between rendering those s properly , and not . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these pages keep reverting . <p> Dave , All of your readers will know the abbreviations . You know you only put it there for markup reasons , not for accessibility or anything like that . So if you put them there , make sure you do it right . IMO you can better use abbr than acronym . Besides that there are certain JavaScript hacks/workaround or you could pust put in a useless span ( just like CSSZenGarden ; ) ) . <p> AnneDaves reasoning strikes me as more than sound , and I 'm not just saying that cause that 's how I code on sidesh0w . Obviously , the distinction between what we *should* be coding and what were forced to support is one we need to be mindful of . <p> Otherwise , you and I would be serving our sites as application/xhtml+xml to all user agents , rather than making exceptions for Internet Explorer . ; ) <p> Anne , you 're assuming too much . From an e-mail I received this morning , for example : <p> " I 've been looking around your sites for a wee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it was browser dependent and would cause problems with text-only browsers and visually impaired users . I see I do n't  need to worry anymore . " <p> Not to single out this person specifically , but e-mails like this tell me I have people reading my site of all levels of skill and knowledge . Making blanket statements about what some will or wont understand is a dangerous precedent . <p> I 'm not opposed to hacks , but Javascript seems the wrong way to go about it to me . Perhaps I 'll consider a span approach . Perhaps not . Maybe I 'll just drop the **28;2565;TOOLONG approach altogether and go with naked spans ! <p> Point being , there 's no obsequious way to do it in 2003 , thanks to IE. Can we move on ? <p> Surely having unstylable abbr tags in IE is not a problem huge enough to use the incorrect acronym tag instead ? <p> So your XHTMLs and your CSSs do n't  have the dotted underline ! If users of IE care so much about such a minor detail , why are they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't  think pandering to a browsers needs should take the place of correct coding in a case where such a minor effect is seen . The BMH solves a possibly major layout issue . Unstyled abbrs are a minuscule affair in comparison . <p> Maybe I 'm missing a point here but this seems to me like a no brainer . <p> Actually , if you have changed your cache settings to " every time " or " always " ( excuse the fuzziness , I 'm on a Mac so this is second hand info ) as developers are wont to do then youll still have the blink . The default setting of " automatically " does n't  suffer from this visual stutter though . <p> With a little tinkering , I have fixed the acronym plugin for MT to produce correct acronym/abbr markup ( title supplied with first instance ; subsequent instances are marked up , but without title ) . And ( with the usual crufty Javascript hacks ) it works in IE. 
@@99593611 @3793611/ <p> Alright ! Now were going somewhere ! The Zen Garden has shown up on BD4D and Newstoday , both design portals that reach the other half of the audience that the Garden is intended for . <p> I 've said it a few times now , and feel free to correct me if you see it differently the problem has been that code geeks have wrapped their mind around advanced CSS layout and know how to use it well , but they 're incapable of anything beyond simple , boxy layouts . Designers havent had the slightest interest in figuring it out due to sketchy browser support , and far more importantly , lack of design tools . That 's why the best graphic designers are so focused on Flash its intuitive to build with , has a wellbuilt design interface , and the coding works . All the time . In every browser . <p> Were hitting a turning point here , where valid CSS layout is now more than a pipe dream , its a legitimate way of building a site . Once designers get their mind around it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amazing things . Bet on it . <p> ( Incidentally , there have been 8 additions to the Garden since its launch , make sure not to miss the latest ) 30454 @qwx890454 <p> They will not all function . Several of them ( even most ) get overlapping text ( large chunks of it ) with just a bit of text zoom ( and some minimum font size ) in Mozilla et . al . <p> The result is text that can not be read . ( In at least one case you cant even get at the links to change to a different style sheet because of severe text overlapping . ) <p> The solution is to go for simpler design . Some things just ca n't be reliably done with CSS . <p> Good design with CSS ( at least for screen display ) must always be flexible . It must work under wildly varying conditions . If not - its broken . If its broken , it should not play , not matter how pretty the colors and the pictures . <p> Bertilo , I think the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a " simpler design " but to be able to show " how pretty the colors and the pictures " are while utilizing a different medium besides Flash or conventional HTML methods ( i.e. slicing and messy code ) <p> Some designs may be made to be ULTRA flexible and be very simple . Others , as flexible as it can be , without consideration of a users personal browser preferences . Design and coding is for the greater good , anyway , so frankly , why should we consider the 0.05% ( random percent here ) who fiddle with their settings ? To my understanding , a majority of web surfers do n't  touch the " factory settings " and surf happily away . Thus , having the designs on Zen Garden appeasing 99% of users using the lastest browsers . <p> Bertilo , you 're way too dogmatic . If I were to call CSS a complete failure because I could n't kern my text in it , ( which is a perfectly valid design concern , I can not yet do that ) then I 'd have abandoned it long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it does n't  conform to your narow criteria is a flawed approach . <p> I am willing to concede that the designers ( myself included ) are to blame for examples in the Garden which do n't  handle a bit of font scaling . That does n't  mean their designs are broken , merely that they did n't  account for the contingency . Right now the biggest challenge with CSS is cross-browser support , and we 've just about figured that out . But its still pretty easy to get lost in testing for the various browsers , and forgetting about font scaling . <p> View Mike Picks Dead or Alive , Keiths Wicked Grove and my recent addition Coastal Breeze for some designs which safely allow you to jump up two font sizes in Mozilla . See , it can be done given forethought and proper testing . Now go read my link again for reasons why it ca n't always be done given the current state of CSS . <p> haiyan - I 'm up for the challenge . Send me a JPG . If I think the design itself is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ build it myself . I built all my examples in Photoshop first , the exact same way I 'd build a tabled design , and then converted them afterwards to CSS . If you 're familiar with the approach , its just as easy ( and I have to say , even despite all the IE5 testing , its even easier ) as building a site with tables . <p> Bertilo - We could debate all day about what consitutes " broken " In my mind none of these really " break " . But hey , I get your point . I would also agree with Daves assertion that most people do n't  muck with the " factory " settings . <p> Haiyan - I too do the majority of my designs in Photoshop first and then convert them . I do n't  do everything in all CSS , but that is neither here nor there . If you are interested in a process for coverting photoshop designs into Web standard , CSS based code , I guess Zeldmans new book , Designing With Web Standards , has some really good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the aesthetics-side of the project , making the site gorgeous to look at , but completely unusable. coders tend to go all out on functionality , making the site totally functional , but looks like a crappy , generic jakob nielson " use-it " site . <p> nobody will ever get that balance right because the median is different with each person . to constantly bitch about usability is the same as constantly bitching about the aesthetics . the key is to quit your bitching and realize that your pride is irrelevant in the end-product ; the site is for your clients audience whatever works for them , go with it . <p> Man , I was waiting for you to show up , haze ! Good points as always , and as always , here 's my addendum/refutation : <p> There are general points that most people can agree are consistently good principles for every audience , and the rest are details . Macromedias approach is going to be totally different than Microsofts , because they 're targetting different end users . But neither of em would use red text @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ definitely middle ground here , but dogmatic right-brainers are going to miss it just as easily as flighty left-brainers . <p> Well , its all about fluid design , regardless of how they " look " they will all still function . And frankly , I 'm going to have to disagree with Bertilo on this anyway , I 've checked a few of them with various font sizes and they seem to look pretty well . I know when i was working on Wicked Grove I checked this out and was fairly happy with the results . <p> There are no assurances , with CSS or otherwise , as Dave points out , when the user ultimately controls the experience . I mean , I could go to say , k10k , turn of my images and that site is going to " look horrible " right ? ? <p> Most of the designs in the Zen Garden are actually amazingly beautiful , outright stunning as long as you use the same browser settings as the authors . If you use other settings for fonts and especially font sizes ( font @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , most of the current designs ( yes , that is most ! ) break horribly . That means they look horrible . I have to use strong words here : The Zen Garden , as it stands now , only shows how badly you can design with CSS . Sorry , but that 's the way it is . <p> That is indeed the point with the CSS Garden . But " what can be done " is not only good design . " What can be done " also includes bad design , e.g. design that breaks and design that sometimes looks awful . <p> Actually the Zen Garden has ( among other things ) shown exactly that . <p> I however thought that the contributions that are accepted into the garden should be the good ones , not the bad ones . <p> Keith : Its fairly obvious that you are n't  the target audience for the CSS Zen Garden - Graphic Designers are . If they come to the site , see some neat designs done with CSS and find some value in it , then the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see designs that could actually be used on the web ? Are they supposed to be tricked into believing that some things can be done with CSS , that actually cant ? <p> Keiht : Also , if you look at my design ( Wicked Grove ) , I checked it in numerous browsers and it scales just fine , I do n't  think it breaks at all . <p> True . Wicked Grove is one of those that do work . Its a superb design . Congrats ! ( Well , actually it break just a little at extreme text zoom , but nowhere near the worst examples in the Garden . ) <p> Keith : Maybe , to enlighen those who might not know , you can " delve into the actual CSS " and explain where they go wrong . <p> OK . I picked A Garden Apart ( more or less at random ) . It has among other things these rules ( slightly abbreviated here ) : <p> #quickSummary position : absolute ; top : 92px ; right : 0 ; <p> #linkList position @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; <p> #linkList2 margin : 190px 15px 15px 15px ; <p> The values for margin for #linkList2 is the main problem here . The value 190px gives the vertical space where #quickSummary is supposed to live . That presupposes that #quickSummary will not need more than 190px vertically . #quickSummary however has text content , and there is no telling how high it will actually turn out to be . With just a bit of text zoom it will be much more than 190px , and its text will overlap that of #linkList2 . <p> This design could perhaps have been more robust if em units had been used instead of px . <p> Dave S : Bertilo , you 're way too dogmatic . If I were to call CSS a complete failure because I could n't kern my text in it , ( which is a perfectly valid design concern , I can not yet do that ) then I 'd have abandoned it long ago . <p> I did not call CSS a failure . I only said that some things can not be done with CSS . So , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of nice things we can do . <p> Keith : We could debate all day about what consitutes " broken " In my mind none of these really " break " . <p> If you cant read the text , not even with a magnyfying glass , since the text you 're trying to read overlaps with other text , then the page is most certainly as broken as broken can ever be . <p> Lea : why should we consider the 0.05% ( random percent here ) who fiddle with their settings ? <p> Because they are not " fiddling " . They are adjusting their browsers so they can use the web . Some people need to set a minimum font size and/or font zooming in order to be able to read the text at all , or to be able to read it without eye strain or headaches . Some peole do not know how to adjust their browser , some do . Do we really want to punish those that do know , and that need to adjust their settings ? Why not just go ahead and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Windows ) with another browser than the one installed by default ( MSIE ) ? Why have they " fiddled " with their disks ( instaling Linux instead ) ? Why have they fiddled with their default programs ( installing Mozilla ) ? Most people ( more than 90% , I 'd guess ) do n't  do these things . Why care about the other few percent of " fiddlers " at all ? <p> Bertilo , I think you 've seriously missed the point of this exercise . The garden is n't a real site . It does n't  have real users or even real uses . Its an example of how something primarily functional like semantic html can be made beautiful . Of course youd implement some things differently if you were making a real site - TechnOhm has an image called bandwidthkiller.jpg for petes sake . <p> Bertilo - You really have missed the point . I mean can you tell me that not one of the designs works for you under any circumstances ? I do n't  think so . If anything , blame the design not the technology @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whatsoever over the actual HTML page and are limited to just editing a style sheet ? ? That shows the amazing power of what CSS can do - you could , for instance , create your own stylesheet for this site , thus making it display however works for you . Or , if it was a " real " site a basic stylesheet could be very easily made available to those folks who might have problems with a certain design . <p> The point here is that you CAN change the font size , and you CAN change the stylesheet to suit your needs . This can also be done fairly easily or in a rather complex manner , whatever suits your needs . Its flexible . <p> The point of this was to show some of the extreme things that can be done with CSS - obviously we could very easily show more simple flexible designs , but that is n't the point . The fact that were even having this discussion proves the fact that CSS based designs are extremely flexible . <p> Jemaleddin : The garden is n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or even real uses . <p> So what 's its use then ? Designs that look pretty ( with some limited user settings ) , but ca n't be used in real sites are of little or no value . <p> Keith : I mean can you tell me that not one of the designs works for you under any circumstances ? I do n't  think so . <p> Of course not . Some of them work very well , but most do n't  . That 's what I wrote . <p> Just have a spin with Mozilla or some other Gecko-based browser , using text zoom etc . You 'll see for yourself how many of the designs break ( remember : try to read the text ) . <p> I have n't delved into the actual CSS to find out precisely where the faulty designs go wrong , but it seems to mainly center aroung repositioning of major parts of the content . Drastic repositioning , changing the actual order of the content , can often only be done if you specify the exact width and/or height , and also position , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now how much space the content of those elements will need . And there 's the rub : You cant know how much space text will take , since you cant know and you ca n't control which fonts and what font sizes will be used ( you can only suggest ) . If you can edit the HTML and change the order of the content elements there , then you can get a lot more done . The Zen Garden however ( as far as I understand ) tries to demonstrate how much you can do with CSS only . But some ( many ) of the designers are trying to do things you cant really do that way . <p> Anyone who thinks you can control the fonts and the font sizes has misunderstood what CSS is and how it works ( at least for the WWW ) . <p> These problems would get immensly larger if the designs were to be used with templates , where the actual content can vary . Serious web publishing very often uses templates . <p> Again , you are missing the point . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Designs that look pretty ( with some limited user settings ) , but ca n't be used in real sites are of little or no value . " <p> The point is to show what CAN be done with CSS . Period . <p> All of these sites have value in showing how HTML can be manipulated with CSS to produce some extreme , " controlled " if you want to go there , designs . What 's more - I would assert that all of these designs are more USEFUL and USABLE than many of the tabled , pixel perfect layouts you see many designers out there producing . Some of the designs might not be " prefect " but who says any of this is black and white . Its an experiment for crying out loud . <p> Its fairly obvious that you are n't  the target audience for the CSS Zen Garden - Graphic Designers are . If they come to the site , see some neat designs done with CSS and find some value in it , then the site is a success . <p> Also , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I checked it in numerous browsers and it scales just fine , I do n't  think it breaks at all . This is an open site , you are free to take this to the next level and produce your own design that not only looks good , but also fits whatever critera you choose . I 'm quite confident that it can be done . <p> Maybe , to enlighen those who might not know , you can " delve into the actual CSS " and explain where they go wrong . 30455 @qwx890455 30451 @qwx890451 <p> You are reading " And So the Garden Grows " , an entry posted on 19 May , 2003 , to the Placid collection .

Which I wouldnt. ( vocubulary fun : mentioning something by pointing out how you are n't  mentioning it is called " paraleipsis " ) <p> I must agree with " allgood2 " , personally I use pMachine after using just about every tool out there . pMachine is simply amazing . Very highly recommended . And no I do n't  have a vested interest in the software . Other than being a user . <p> PC to Mac , ASP to PHP. jeez , no small switch . Okay , you 're still using PCs but you know what mean . All the best and were all rootin that this planes lands safely . <p> I played around with it and not being more than mediocre at photoshop , I could not get decent results ( similar to transparent gif ) , so Iam personally sticking to serving bgSleight to IE ( http : **31;2595;TOOLONG ) . <p> Make sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . html NOT the nasty . php , given that you 're presumably going to be using PHP in most/all your pages . This gives more flexibility , especially if you later decide to move away from PHP . <p> Just add : AddType application/x-httpd-php . html to your . htaccess file or config , as you probably know . What could be simpler ? <p> How is . html any less nasty than . asp or . php ? File extensions are insignificant to any reasonably advanced web server . There 's no reason to have a file extension at all . Simply turn on multiviews in Apache ( its on by default on the new server ) and address the resource sans extension ( or as a faux directory ) and the correct file will be negotiated . <p> Ive been hiding most of my file extensions for more than a year , simply by having lots of folders . I have n't found any resource that says having lots of folders is A Bad Thing , so I can happily switch around from . html to . asp to . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spot I 'm going to have trouble with is my MT archives , thanks to my inability in figuring out how to drop the extension when I was tinkering a few months ago . But a liberal dose of . htaccess should clear that right up . <p> I 've wrapped my mind around canonical date-based archiving in the configuration , that part was no problem . It was the links I was having trouble generating . I could n't see a way ( in this case ) to get them to drop the trailing /default.asp . There must be a way , I just did n't  find it when I had time to play around with this . <p> It has to be ridiculously easy , but it was two months ago now that I was playing around , and I cant remember why I could n't . This is something I 'll re-visit only once I 've re-built the site though , so it wo n't happen right away . Thank god for weekends . <p> Because you 're unnecessarily associating your sites technology with a particular extension . . html is generic , whereas . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the moment , you 'd have to parse . asp for PHP if the filenames werent to change . Perhaps that 's not actually a problem as such , but it is somewhat incongruous . <p> &gt; File extensions are insignificant to any reasonably advanced web server . There 's no reason to have a file extension at all . <p> Indeed , this is recommended by the W3C . Personally I feel that using . html rather than obviously techology-specific extensions such as . php is a better compromise if one cant/wont avoid using extensions entirely . <p> I know exactly what Cleveland looks like from the air , and from just about every compass point to boot , so I 'll be happy to help out so long as you 're willing to gain some altitude so I can get a read of the land .

@@99593614 @3793614/ <p> So AdSense has been the big thing for the past few months , yeah ? I just ca n't do that to this site . Not only am I not trying to make money here ( at least , in the " Im writing for a paycheque " sense ) , but they taste horrible . Others are making hundreds , if not thousands off of AdSense . Its tempting to throw in the towel and just go for it to see what results , but I 'm still not ready to compromise yet . ( Give me a month of huge overage charges on my hosting plan and watch how quickly I turn to the big G. ) <p> What I have been experimenting with is Amazons referral program . For the past few weeks I 've simply added a referral I 'd to all outgoing links to amazon.com . I 've made about 30 bucks ( $US , no less , and that means a lot north of the 49th ) , and that 's not too bad for the minimal effort . I noticed my inclination to link something on Amazon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . <p> All of which lead to thinking that resulted in a recommended reading list on the right ( spurred further by Matt Mullenwegs recent ruminations ) . The idea is that by sharing books I like , by letting you know what has been helpful to me in hopes that it will be helpful to you , I can continue supporting my habit and buying more books to recommend . While this blurs the lines between content and advertising , the expectation is that new users of this site will be able to quickly distinguish , and those more familiar will completely ignore it . <p> The effectiveness of this method will probably lessen over time , but I 've noticed a nice little jump after launching a few nights ago . I 'm looking forward to the first shipment when I decide to order in a week or three . Any recommendations ? <p> Some will note that I 've replaced the photo journal . After my rebuild last month , I had broken it to the point where new images were no longer being picked up , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this back one day when I have time , and its still available at the old URI , but itll have to wait as I have more pressing things to attend to . <p> update : Then again , I suppose its not available . I followed the link and got a type mismatch . Which goes to show a ) that I am not much of a coder , and b ) neglect is obvious . 30454 @qwx890454 <p> As long as ads are not intrusive , I am fine with them . The ads on Daring Fireball are a perfect example . Mr Gruber has made a nice compromise . Although the fact that the ads do n't  stand out will definitely affect click-thrus , I do n't  see any other way without affecting the overall feel of the site . That said , I like the Amazon referrals much more , especially when books are concerned . It may be seem as an ad , but really you are promoting the books that you personally approve . That makes all the difference ( unlike in the case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It also allows you to continue buying books . So in the end , I actually prefer that you have the amazon referral service . I will value your advice and selection because I trust you . Because of this I prefer the amazon referral service . <p> Sunny is right on the mark - with Amazon , you get to choose the products . Theyve even added a keyword feature where the products that are shown ( say , books ) are ones that match a predetermined keyword . The ad I have on the webmaster board for B4TF shows two books related to the keywords " web site usability " and rotate with each page refresh . That keeps the content , so to speak , fresh , and hopefully will lead to increased click-thrus and , even more hopefully , sales . : - ) <p> Jai - Yep , there 's that . If I 'm going to do this , I 'm going to try and make them mesh with everything else . They 're the second most attention-grabbing thing on the page right now ; I 'm not sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they look like they belong there . That 's a good start . <p> Sunny , Bob - precisely . Having control over what Im shilling is pretty important . <p> Amazon does n't  offer real-time stats , so I 'm eagerly awaiting the next turn-over to see how well these do . I 'm debating posting the results or not ; I might have to divulge a bit more info than I 'd like to do that , though . <p> Am I the only person who 's finding that AdSenses payments are minuscule ? Its kind of depressing to hear about people making thousands of dollars off their ads when I 've made about $50 in over a month <p> You know , I 've been doing the Amazon referral thing for quite a while and so far Ive made a whopping $.52 . I get quite a few quick throughs , but no conversions . I guess my readers like their music free . <p> I too have thought and rejected the whole AdWords thing , but lately Ive been re-thinking it . I 've also been approached about other types of advertising and rejected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sell out " , and part of me thinks it really would n't be that big a deal as long as I did it right and kept the content up to what my readers expect . <p> The point is n't to make money , I agree , but hell we all know a lot of effort goes into our sites and not everyone has the opportunity to write their own book . What 's wrong with a little payback for all that effort ? ? <p> I just do n't  know . But I for one do n't  mind if someone has well thought-out , unobtrusive ads on their site . Hey as long as you do n't  *make* me sit through it or click through to get the content Im cool . <p> Ive been approached a few times by people wanting to place a small link on my page to improve their PageRank . I 've said no each time . Screwing with the system like that just feels wrong . <p> Then , the flip side is that its screwing with another companys system . PageRank is n't open , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , its not as morally offensive to me as someone trying to make money off spam or DoS attacks or the like . <p> There 's a fine line here . I 'm still trying to figure out where it is , and which side I fall on . I 'm all for purity , but I 'm also for sustainibility . <p> I would n't discourage you from doing the GoogleAds . The ones on http : //daringfireball.net/ are quite inoffensive ( aesthetically , I mean ) . If you put them there , I 'll almost certainly click them from time to time . <p> I applied to AdSense , figuring that with all the traffic I 'm suddenly getting on B4TF , I might make a few pennies here and there . Unfortunately , they rejected me outright - not once , but twice : I applied right after opening the site , and again a couple of days ago after my traffic spiked up into the hundreds of thousands of hits per month . <p> So now I 'm also trying the Amazon thing . Like Keith , I 'm getting click-throughs , but no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but I figured that itd be nice to be able to supplement what I 'm paying per month with a little donated money , and the purchaser gets something useful for themselves in return . <p> Keith - Yer not the nly 1 who 's gramer and spling go to hek when typing coment - just thought I 'd let you in on that <p> Dave S. I mean Dave Shea ( being that there 's 2 Dave S.s in this post ) - I actually found your rotating amazon booklist ad appealing . Its aestetically very nice , especially with the dabs of varying color that it gives the site- especially when that book by the real Slim Jeffrey is up there . It looks really nice- made me click through it . <p> Dave S. I mean the other one- the Staus one with the great tutorial on Graphic file formats for teh web on his site- I had to frickin look for the google ads on http : //daringfireball.net/ . That 's extremely unintrusive . I wonder if anyone ever clicks them at all . That kind of defeats the purpose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unobtrussive but visible . I like them better when they look great . I hate when they are force fed to me though- except last year there was a Flash ad for the supernowl on MSN ( wait , MSN had pop-up ads ? ) and I was initially upset but the ad was frickin cool so I let it go . <p> I 'm not sure its worth going halfway towards making a site commercial unless you 're desperate to cover your hosting bill . If you keep money completely out of things then people wont think twice before linking to you , and its clear to visitors that you 're doing what you 're doing for the love of it . If you go all out and try to make cash from a site then people also understand that and have different expectations . The area in the middle is murky ; putting ads on a previously non-commercial site can seem greedy and make the site feel like yet another cheap portal . <p> I think the amazon recommendations are great , and I would also support Google ads if you were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all four ads every time there is a new article at DaringFireball . His articles are always wonderfully written and extremely informative , so I actually like feeling like I 'm helping him out , just by making a few clicks of my mouse after reading a several page article . It beats having to subscribe to some magazine or an online e-zine to read his articles . I would feel the same way if you were to add the ads to your site . <p> Dave , your " Ads " do n't  feel like ads at all . They feel like what they are labeled as- Recommendations . I did n't  even know they were ads until I clicked on one . Honestly , I think you 've done a nice job with them , and as a designer who comes here often to learn new design stuff , those particular recomendations are a helpful supplement to my learning . If you make a couple US dollars off it , then that 's probably well deserved . I do n't  feel like Mezzoblues been commerdialized in the least . <p> Dave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ site stats grow as blogs get more mainstream . Its interesting that the American Dream is to make money at doing something you love and that blogging is providing a medium for that . I had ruminated about this recently : <p> Though my conclusion at the time was " probably not , " Im now much more of the opinion that I 'd like to at least cover my costs of web hosting ( which is now $100/year ) . <p> Two questions regarding your setup : <p> * Are you using some form of web services to grab a cover-shot and description from Amazon ? * Is the sole definition of a commercial site the ability to turn a profitif so , do we need to pay SixApart a commercial license fee ? <p> Kenn , you raise some interesting points . I would hazard that pulling in a few extra bucks is n't enough to warrant a site Commercial . I have no product but free information ; any extra revenue is solely a diversion . Regardless , I 've long had my MT key so I think I 'm okay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ non-existent . I pulled the product shots off Amazon and re-sized them , so they sit on my server . The text and links are all stored in a file on this site as ASP variables , and randomized . Too few items to mess around with databases . <p> Matt , I 've thought about that . I do n't  know that its a mindset most have though . Take for example the interview I did recently on DMXZone , or the article on Digital Web . Both sites are supported by ads , and most people did n't  think twice about linking . <p> To be honest , half the time I think people are MORE inclined to link to central resources like those two sites , but more because they 're collaborative efforts ( and not just one persons voice ) than anything to do with ads . <p> Ads are pretty much here to stay . We all expect them sooner or later . I think my method is pretty unobtrusive , but well see how it goes . I may get sick of them myself in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too commercial , because you very rarely see them on commercial sites . This is because the nature of the program would put ads for your competitors on your page , and to my knowledge they do n't  provide a way to prevent that . <p> I concur that the Amazon links are more than OK . I consider mezzoblue a credible and useful source , and my assumption was that you are only recommending books youve actually read . I feel the same way about Tycho on Penny Arcade . If he raves about the game , I hope he is getting paid to do so . I 've gotten to the point where I buy stuff solely on his recommendation , due to a 90%+ success rate with that . 30455 @qwx890455 30451 @qwx890451 <p> You are reading " Amazon Referrals " , an entry posted on 29 August , 2003 , to the Caught collection .

Mezzoblue does n't  strobe the header on me either now . : - ) <p> Anyway , Dave and Matt , maybe its my ISP , maybe something else , but I get flicker on both Photomatt and now on Mezzoblue - even when I set to Never . <p> We used to have that problem on our site , but it disappeared after we switched hosts ( to one in Vancouver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I found that there was mention of some sort of IE bug . <p> Anyway , Dave and Matt , maybe its my ISP , maybe something else , but I get flicker on both Photomatt and now on Mezzoblue - even when I set to Never . <p> We used to have that problem on our site , but it disappeared after we switched hosts ( to one in Vancouver , no less ) . While searching around though , I found that there was mention of some sort of IE bug . <p> I have n't tried that . htaccess method yet but it is illuminating and could help in an Apache environment . Thanks for sharing . <p> I have to concur with what Mike ( comments 3/4 ) suggested about this being an " ISP " issue . It actually seems to be determined by some setting on the server , or perhaps a certain firewall setting , or maybe something else even more arcane . <p> Right now , I have the same exact web site ( exactly the same files ) on two different Windows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which I am both accessing via the internet . The site on one of the servers exhibits the " flicker " while the same site on the other server has no flicker at all . Both servers in question are remote to my workstation ( meaning : separated over the internet ) , but a third , development server on my local network does not display the flicker in IE either . Of course , the flicker does not occur in Mozilla on any server . <p> I am just guessing here , but I do n't  think that this is a bandwidth or even a processing speed issue on either the client side or the server side . I think it has to do with how the client is instructed to " cache " ( or not cache ) certain items through " document headers " sent by the server . <p> By " document headers " I am not referring to &lt;meta&gt; tags in the &lt;head&gt; tag of an HTML file . Document headers are not in the source code of a web page or something that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little bits of code that a device which is loading and displaying a file being downloaded ( a device such as a web browser ) can use ( or ignore ) to " figure out " how to best display the file , as well as whether or not to cache it , or any other number of things . <p> So , perhaps one of the two remote servers in my case is somehow sending a document header that IE is interpreting as , " Do not cache this file " . IE therefore caches the files from one server , but not from the other . The server who 's files are not getting cached exhibits the flicker . <p> I need to find a tool that will allow me to examine the document headers being sent by an IIS web server . <p> Thanks for the input above !

@@99593618 @3793618/ <p> Two weeks in the land down under is just enough to get a taste , but not nearly enough to deeply experience what this amazingly large continent has to offer . <p> My wife April and I travelled to Australia from late September to mid October 2004 for the Web Essentials 2004 conference , and stayed on an extra week for a vacation . Our time was split between two cities , Sydney and Melbourne ( and any generalizations apply to them alone . ) <h> Sydney <h> Day Zero <p> North America and Sydney are about 12,000km apart . This is about a third of the way around the world , plus a little bit . After parking your rear in a plane seat one thing is abundantly clear : make the best of it , because you 're not moving for a long , long time . <h> Day One <p> Our first Southern Pacific sunrise , just on the far side of the International Date Line . <p> The flight brought us in early one Monday morning , but clearing the airport proved somewhat time consuming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but after clearing it and claiming our bags we were sent through another line for something called Quarantine . While there have always been border restrictions on importing organic material in any country , labeling it so starkly and then providing bins to dump any non-importable items felt like a whole new level of control . <p> The Bondi shoreline one overcast afternoon . <p> Coming out of the terminal we met up with John , our tour guide and trip sponsor . Since it was still early in the morning , the hotel was n't ready yet , and we were feeling well-rested enough anyway , plans were made to head to Bondi Beach for a quick breakfast and tour of the area . Meeting up with his business partner Maxine , who ordered Vegemite with her toast specifically for our benefit ( though we never did end up having any ) , we were treated to our first Australian coffee . <h> Day Two <p> The Queen Victoria building fa+ade . <p> A bit of exploration started our day . We oriented ourself along George St. , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Our hotel , the Mercure , was situated on the southern end by Chinatown and Darling Harbour , so these got most of our attention . The former felt similar in character to the Vancouver and San Francisco equivalents , the latter is a planned upscale harbour area with restaurants , theatres , and tourist diversions . We managed to stumble far enough north to discover the beautiful Queen Victoria building , a shopping centre blocks long with an intricate decorative tile floor , wrought iron balconies , beautifully ornate arches , and detailed stone work and statues around the exterior . <p> The evening was spent at a private surf club back in Bondi , following a walk along the shorefront . Apparently the colour of the original iMac , dubbed Bondi Blue , was inspired by the water of this beach not much of a stretch to imagine when you see its brilliant aquamarine tossing around foamy whitecaps . <h> Days Three , Four , and Five <p> Conference preparation day , followed by the two days of the conference itself . Notes on the experience feel out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a separate write-up . <h> Day Six <p> Sydney Harbour panorama . <p> Sydneys famed Opera House , from a distance . <p> Opera House roof tiles close up . <p> With the conference over , this was the first official tourist day . Starting with the famous Sydney harbour , we made our way along the sea-front from the Harbour Bridge to the Opera House , and then on to the stunning Botanic Gardens . Sydneys Opera House is of course the landmark to see when in Australia , so I spent a bit of extra time photographing the shapes and contours . The pristine white roof is a series of interlocking tiles that are unnoticeable from a distance , but quite off-white on close-up . <p> The Botanic Gardens is a large green area in the middle of the city , flanked by The Domain , an almost equally large continuation . Both contain cultural and historical highlights ( including the first farm of the Australian colony ) , along with the rich and varied flora and fauna from around the globe . A tree full of bats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> I would n't be surprised to learn this is one of the larger downtown city parks of the world , but I do n't  have anything to base that on other than a sense of scale of this particular one . And as if they werent enough , further south is Hyde Park , a segmented park spanning many city blocks from north to south . We crossed through the centre and spent some time in the Anzac memorial , a war shrine dedicated to Australia and New Zealands armed forces . <p> The evening saw a trip back out to Bondi and a barbecue at our hosts place , in lieu of the beach barbie we had to cancel on account of the weather . Great lamb , good beer , and excellent company its a pretty universal formula for a nice evening . <h> Day Seven <p> The Manly shoreline , the beach is somewhere behind us . <p> Destination : Manly . The beach , that is . A harbour ferry ride takes you out toward the ocean , and north to a narrow peninsula of land @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ winding beach . Manly is well-regarded by the locals , and for good reason . The water is bright and sparkling , the beach gives way to hikable trails along the cliffs , and the shops and restaurants offer fare from around the world . <p> The latter half of the day was spent preparing the next leg of our journey , which took us to Melbourne . <h> Day Eight <p> Travel day . When checkout is 11am , your flight departs at 5pm , and you do n't  get to your hotel until 8:30pm , the day goes by a bit too quickly . <h> Melbourne <p> Melbourne skyline , black swan . <p> Melbourne is magic . Deemed one of , if not the most livable city in the world , a few days spent wandering the British-style arcades and browsing the shops was enough to convince me that I could very happily spend a lot of time there . <h> Days Nine , Ten , and Eleven <p> Block Arcade , one of the many beautifully-detailed arcades in downtown Melbourne . <p> St. Pauls Cathedral , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Even the alleys and dumpsters are interesting in Melbourne . <p> The first day in Melbourne was spent orienting ourselves . We stayed at Rydges on Exhibition street , which is right inside the downtown core and a short walk to most of what we wanted to see . <p> Armed with a tourist guide and a will to explore , we wandered the shops and streets . This does n't  sound like three days worth of activity , but trust me , Melbourne has enough to fill that time and more . In fact , we did n't  even leave the central business district aside from an afternoon bike ride along the Yarra river and through the botanical gardens . Plans were made to visit the close-by Richmond and St. Kilda districts , but weather pushed that plan to the back seat . <p> What makes the downtown core so interesting is the sheer density ; an afternoon could be well-spent exploring a three block radius , and youd still leave with the impression you had n't  caught everything there was to see in the area . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with shops and running between and under the streets of the city . <p> There are sights to see , of course we made it to Queen Victoria Market , the Rialto Towers , most of the arcades highlighted on our maps , Bourke and Swanston Streets ( the intersection of which features whimsical flying animals on top of lightposts ) , and more . Notably , we meant to drive the Great Ocean Road but the three days we had proved too short . <h> The People <p> Australian people are a hospitable , sport-loving bunch . Our stay overlapped both a major football match and a federal election , and it was abundantly obvious which the locals were following more closely . The closing of the match saw Sydney erupt in jubilant celebration and good natured yelling in the streets between fans of each team . <p> Service while in the country was always friendly , surprisingly despite the Australian no-tipping philosophy . <p> Australians take their coffee as seriously as Europeans . Starbucks is the Wal-mart of coffee down here , and rightfully so . Compared to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clearly third rate . <p> Australia is a major wine-producing country , and we hear the local products are quite good . The few glasses I had were quite tasty and comparable to what may be found in Canadas wine regions . <p> Also as in Canada , the major local beers appear to all be lighter lager and ale , with darker beers being relegated to the microbreweries . Getting anything darker than a pale ale proved to be a challenge , but was n't without its reward the stouts and porters found were on par with some of the best Canada has to offer , although a local hefeweizen proved an interesting alternative as well . <h> Globalization <p> Its hard to call it globalization when the term mainly refers to the creeping of American culture into everyone elses . While its sometimes a two way street , aside from the odd British chain ( Virgin , Vodafone , HMV ) the majority of homogenization in Australia is imported from the US . Most noticeable in food chains like McDonalds , Starbucks , Subway , 7-11 , but spreading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Kinkos , Minuteman ) . Try having a conversation with an Australian without talking about the Simpsons American TV shows are all over the airwaves . Jerry Springer never felt so out of place as in Melbourne . <p> Rather charming is the ubiquitous " Hungry Jacks " , a chain which in all ways but name is identical to Burger King , including logo . That 's because it is Burger King , or at least a wholly-owned ( and branded ) subsidiary . The story goes that a local trademarked the name before Burger King set up shop , forcing the mega-chain to franchise under a different name . There 's also an amusing sub-plot about the franchisee suing the parent company when the trademark expired . In any case , they 're now everywhere . <h> Currency <p> If there 's one thing you can say for Australian money , its that its rugged . The coins are thicker and larger than many other currencies , and the bills are made of durable plastic which you can run through the wash ( though apparently leaving them in for the drier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in favour of a currency system that revolves around 5 and 10 coins come in denominations of 5 cents , 10 cents , 20 cents , 50 cents , $1 , and $2 . Cent coins are silver while dollar coins are gold , although somewhat curiously the silver coins get larger as they increase in value , while the dollar coins shrink . A 50 cent coin is roughly 4 or 5 times the diameter of a $2 coin , while the latter is exactly the same size as a 5 cent coin . <p> Worth about as much as the Canadian dollar , Australian dollars do n't  go nearly as far . An American might expect to pay roughly similar prices for equivalent items back home , whereas Canadians will end up paying a good deal extra roughly 50% more . In an isolated nation without a major world superpower next door , it only stands to reason that trading might be a touch more expensive . <p> The difference between the two forms of access belies the truth about connectivity in Australia its obvious the country is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expected in North America . It sounds like the situation may be improving , as our hotel in Sydney was being fitted with ethernet jacks during our stay , and new wireless points do seem to be popping up . Just try reading Telstras wireless pricing though , and you 'll see that there 's a long way to go . ( Two hours maximum connect time ? Why are they turning away business ? ) <h> Weather <p> Even though we arrived in the early Australian spring , we expected temperate weather and packed accordingly . Bad move , the heat of the first morning in town quickly gave way to clouds and rain . Much of the trip was spent looking out the window and hoping for a change . This was a blessing for the locals , whom we understood were in the middle of a drought , but a bit of a curse throughout our trip . <p> Most days in Sydney remained consistent throughout the course of the day , but Melbourne saw many changes over the day . A sunny morning gave way to a cloudy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by more sun before evening ; in fact , weather changes were quicker than even that . <p> Melbourne was a bit cooler than Sydney , on account of its being further south . That 's an interesting change of mindset to get used to when you 're from the northern hemisphere , since south has always meant warm to me . <h> Readjustments <p> Most of the worlds population lives north of the Equator , so crossing it is a disorienting experience for many . Getting accustomed to the other side of the world is easy if you do n't  think about it . If you happen to start , it becomes a little strange . <p> The first problem is gravity : it still works . You could lie on the ground and grasp anything bolted down to prevent falling off the surface of the planet , but of course that is n't necessary and you 'll look a little silly doing it . But when you point at the ground to vaguely gesture towards the land you live in , you 'll understand in an instant why the urge is there <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a topically relevant episode of the Simpsons , the effect has to do with the spin of the Earth and its influence on large-scale particle systems like weather patterns . On a smaller scale , you can theoretically observe the effect in the way water spins as it drains . In the northern hemisphere , it goes counter-clockwise , and in the southern hemisphere it goes clockwise . Ladies and gentleman , I am here today to tell you that this is , in fact , true . I have seen it for myself . I made a point of filling the sink with water and pulling the plug , and sure enough , in Australia the water rotates clockwise . ( Update : or not . Comments have pointed toward this debunking . Oh well . ) <p> The Equator is n't the only imaginary line crossed en route there 's also the matter of the International Date Line . Time zone differences are generally just a matter of a bit of sleep loss and the odd extra few hours of daylight , but crossing the date line is where things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you either lose an entire day , or gain an extra one . While I suppose on either side I may have seen a few hours of it , the 26th of September did n't  actually happen for me . Coming back , I got two 9th of Octobers . Its a weird phenomenon , the only upside being that you have a fun story for parties ( and the downside being a lot of sleep to catch up on ) . <p> To further complicate matters , Australia has adopted the British method of driving the steering wheel is on the right hand side of the car , you drive on the left hand side of the street . Many a time was spent waiting to enter the drivers side of the car as a passenger , and there were a few narrow misses crossing the street . To further complicate matters , Sydney has many one-way streets and Melbourne has the oddest traffic laws involving turns to account for trams : a right-hand turn involves first driving far to the left within the intersection , then turning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were sure that a driver used to right-hand road rules was just mistaking their turns , until we saw the signs . 30454 @qwx890454 <p> Its always interesting to read an out-of-towners take on my humble hometown , Melbourne , particularly having just spent some time in the US ( I 've not made it as far as Canada yet ) . Glad you had a good trip sorry the weather did n't  live up to expectations . Its been pretty damn nice the last week or so ! <p> About Australians/English driving on the " wrong " sidetheyre ( were ) correct . The reason it is correct dates back to olden days ( not sure exactly when ) when people travelled on horses . They rode their horses on the left , so when meeting a person from the opposite direction , they could a ) shake hands ( which is done with the right hand ) or b ) use their joust which is held in their right hand <p> About getting in the wrong side of the car , I 'm doing this often now as my housemate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ locals look as I " drive " with no hands ! <p> Great to hear that you enjoyed your stay in Australia Dave . It is always interesting to read the perspective of someone else about our tucked-away country . <p> As I 'm sure you 've noticed , everyone involved in IT down here understands your amazement/frusteration with connectivity - cable is overpriced and underperforming , good luck trying to get T1 without your own business and a small fortune . <p> Though Im only 16 , I 've been reading this site for quite a while but this is my first comment . Mezzoblue and CZG are a design inspiration for me and the rest of the world so keep up the great work : ) <p> Firstly , let me thank you for your presentations at WE04 . Truly inspiring to be reminded that standards does n't  equal boring ! <p> I think there are two " Australia Essentials 04 " you missed out on . <p> You really should have attempted vegemite - its great on hot buttered toast ! There are no lingering after-effects . <p> Also , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a climb all the way up one of the ( other ) famous arches . Its surprisingly easy , the view from the top is fantastic and if you pick the time of day you can also see the sunset and watch the city light up for nighttime . <p> Thanks for writing this up . As with Virginia , I found it interesting to see your perspective on our cities and remind me that there are some things close by that I really should go and see . <p> From my experience with living in oz , I must say that the water in the toilets in australia neither spins one way or the other it simply explodes . The first time I flushed a toilet while living in Melbourne I scared myself half to death <p> Odd bit on Hungry Jacks there are a few locations that are actually labeled as Burger King . I recall getting a bite to eat at one around either Epping or Deer Park ( its been a few years , so my memory is sketchy ) . I was surprised that new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HJ . Odd . <p> Dave , it was nice to meet you and April in Sydney , and I 'm glad to hear you enjoyed your stay . Unfortunately I have to agree with Raena , the Coriolis thing is a myth . For years I wanted to believe it was true , to show that that the laws of physics can be broken . but alas . I 've swapped hemispheres a lot of times and drained the water in many sinks across the world to find that science is right : the water spins in whichever way the drain determines . <p> But to back you up on another claim , it reminds me of the Simpons episode where the US embassy in Australia installed a flushing system to reverse the spin . <p> I was also quite taken with Australia when I got a chance to visit ( in May ) a couple of years ago . I only got to see the SE corner ( 12 Apostles - Melbourne - Canberra - Sydney ) but loved it . Melbourne is perhaps one of the best kept secrets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " person , I could quite happily live there . <p> The southern skies were quite a treat for this amateur astonomy-lover . I highly recommend the tour at the Sydney Observatory where you get to look through both the historical refractor which still operates there , and a more modern computer-controlled scope ( weather permitting ) . <p> I 'm glad I do n't  have to take on the Coriolis thing in detail . Essentially , only large-scale events like weather systems are controlled by Coriolis forces . At smaller scales , other factors such as the shape of the basin and whether the water gets pushed in one direction to start have a far larger influence . <p> The coffee thing is interesting . I was last in Australia in 1995 , and the coffee was universally terrible , weak drip , with espresso hard to find , and a surprising amount of instant coffee ( Sanka ) , even in restaurants . Glad that 's changed . Also , not having artificial sweetener ( which was also then impossible to find ) can be a pain when , like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disorienting as a Canadian was not the driving , or the time change , but the movement of the sun . I guess I base a lot of my sense of direction on where the sun is at a given time of day , and I 'm so used to seeing it traverse the southern part of the sky from left to right ( if you look that way ) that I was quite discombobulated when it moved across the north from right to left . My instinct was to confuse south with north , and the direction of sun movement was just wrong for my brain . <p> Melbournes weather is famous enough that the big 80s/90s band Crowded House had a song about it called " Four Seasons in One Day . " Great song , by the way , from their 1991 " Woodface " album . <p> Takes me back to my month down under last year - making many off the same observations . However my suprise of the whole driving on the left ( correct ) side of the road was that they do it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appoach to driving , so that was good to see . <p> As to currency , I think the plastic notes are a fantastic idea , and would like to see them implemented here in the UK too . <p> Manly has got to be the most beautiful set of beaches in Sydney - I thought Bondi did n't  live up to the hype at all . <p> Anyway - WE05 - sounds like a good excuse to spend another month ( or so ) down under next year ! <p> What a great travel report . Its always cool to read about other folks experiences in different countries . <p> I find it so interesting that you spoke in Australia at the conference . Web Standards is alive around the globe and growing but the Australians really seem to be grasping it quicker than others . Every CSS site I visit has some tie in to Oz . I think this is awesome . <p> I live in Northern BC ( not that far from Vancouver , BC ) and yet I was encouraged to look at css/xhtml by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Max Design has been very inspirational . <p> Anyway , loved to hear about the trip , hope you have some money left for coffee someday and thanks for sharing both the trip with us and your experience at Web Essentials . Maybe its time I booked my trip to the land down under , sounds like a whole bunch of neat people . <p> A small side note : when my wife and I were in Ireland we also discovered a land of " no tipping " service people . It was very hard to get out of the habit . Even if they are paid well I still feel like I should reward quality service . <p> ps : i also like the little " slides " you used in the post . Its always kind of neat to see elements from my childhood reused in a modern context . I cant say I enjoyed sitting through slide shows as a kid but I have n't even seen a slide since then so it kind of tickled me to see them in the post . <p> I 've never quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exposes other people to American culture and products ( not many people seem to object to the reverse ) . <p> But in terms of Australian exports to the world , Vegemite issingular . And a very , *very* acquired taste . I managed a third of a cracker with some on it , so was n't able to acquire the taste , but I know people who swear by it . <p> Hi , being an Australian living in Canada , I was quite interested to read your post . You are obviously a very observant person ! You picked up on many distinctive Aussie cultural aspects that many tourists would not notice . <p> One thing I thought was missing - language ! I find Canadians have extreme difficulty understanding my Aussie slang . I have also noticed that not many Canadians have ever been to Australia so you are one of the lucky few : ) <p> Hey Dave , I love your work ! Its people like you that make web design + learning proper CSS usage all the more worthwhile . But mate australian slang for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down-under : ADELAIDE .

@@99593620 @3793620/ <p> Really ? I enjoy using mine and I 'm able to right-click no problem . I have the BT Mighty Mouse so I cant say if the scroll ball will break or not , I 've only had it a few weeks but I use it every day . Each to their own I suppose . <p> My problem with the Mighty Mouse is that it too closely resembles the original one button mouse , so invariably I will use both fingers to click instead of just one , which is a habit I picked up long ago . <p> If there had been a clear distinction between the left and right mouse buttons , I think I would have been happier with it . <p> I used the mighty mouse with an iMac G5 ( iSight ) for 4 months , never had a problem with it . When I order my next laptop ( in the next couple of weeks ) a bluetooth mighty mouse will be part of the order . <p> Been using the mighty mouse here at work for like 4 months now . Its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> 1 ) The scroll ball wont scroll up anymore . Some get stuck in there like on the old ball mice . I found that pushing down on the ball and blowing real hard into the hole clears whatever is obstructing the sensor . <p> 2 ) When I left click something and I need to drag , getting to the end of the mouse pad can be a problem . With a normal button mouse you can just leave the button click and move the mouse to the other side of the pad . With the MM , you have to be careful when moving to the other side of the pad since you actually have to press down on the mouse . So when you move back over , you 'll find that you have a tendency to relax pressure on the mouse thus losing whatever you were dragging like when cropping an image zoomed in at 800% . <p> 3 ) Side buttons == useless . They require too much pressure to be useful . <p> I agree , Dave . I am new to Macs - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now I 'm a convert . ( I was thinking about a PowerBook , but bought the iMac G5 , based , in part , on your March musings about Macs , Intel and Adobe . ) <p> I *love* the iMac , but the mouse was so frustratingly hard to work with , that I replaced it with an MS wireless laser mouse . Havent been sorry about that either . <p> FWIW We have several MM at our office . Only one of us uses a mousepad . His MM is infinitely cleaner than mine , or anybody elses for that matter . He has no scroll-nipple problems , and no gunk on the bottom . <p> This is the funniest and true-to-life post I have ever seen . Great illustration . My MM went to the trash soon after I bought it . All the reasons you have illustrated , especially that damn scroll wheel do-hicky ! Complete garbage ! Thanks Dave you made my day ! <p> I figured there would be folks out there who have had an experience opposite to mine , and that 's okay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it just fine when I got it with my iMac . <p> But after 6 months of daily use the annoyances added up , and I finally threw it on ice and dragged out the trusty old Logitech . So while I 'm not assuming your experience will be similar , I will caution that if you 've only spent a short time with it , you might want to reserve final judgment for a while . <p> Threw out your MX1000 ? I 've slowly worked my way up the Logitech chain to the MX1000 , and I got ta say that its the best mouse I ever used . All the extra buttons are nice , but what I really like about it is how well it fits my hand . There 's no way I 'm going back to something as unergonomic as the mighty mouse . Okay , so its better than the iMac hockey puck , but ergonomically it still stinks . <p> I would n't go as far as saying the Mighty Mouse is garbage but I have 2 big complaints : <p> The " scroll nipple " ( I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I like it Josh ) will sometimes get stuck . This usually happens when I take a swig of diet coke and I get a little condensation on my finger . What I usually do to fix this is press down really hard on the scroll nipple and roll it around in all different directions for about 10 seconds . <p> Sometimes when I left-click it will right-click and when I right-click it will left-click . <p> Its definitely better than my old mouse . Microsoft definitely makes the worse mice known to manlike that 's a surprise . <p> I wanted to like the MM . I really did . But apparently , I hold the mouse at a bit of an angle ( I hadn never noticed before ) , so that nearly every click on the MM registered as a right click , and my thumb rested directly on the ( super-sensitive ) side button , so that every time I had to lift the mouse or move my hand , it would trigger Expose and all of my windows would disappear . After about a month of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ co-worker , and he loves it . <p> Interesting . I almost bought one of these , but even just trying it in the store , I felt the scroll ball was pretty sketchy ; the two-finger trackpad drag is so delightful , I kind of wish a mouse could replicate the exact effect . <p> I wonder if thered be a market for a kind of mouse where its front had an ipod-y sort of scroll zone it <p> I like the scroll-ball , and I now find scroll wheels intolerably one-dimensional . It does require some alarmingly tough love to keep it working ( lots of rubbing alcohol and forceful rapping and rolling ) . Its ridiculous that it apparently is mechanical , not optical . <p> I find the right/left finger sensor is wrong often enough to be annoying , but not often enough to put me off . <p> I could n't agree more . I 'm on my second Mighty Mouse and I 'm again having trouble with the scroll " nipple " ( such a brilliant term ah , the blogosphere ) . It decided one day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right are still working and useless but down ? No such luck . <p> I do n't  actually mind my mighty mouse . I like the scroll ball ( or nipple , heh ) , as opposed to the wheel , since it works fine for me . Unlike many , I have not had the problem with the scroll ball not moving up . <p> I do not have trouble with the two button scheme it used , though I agree they should have just used buttons . <p> I 'm glad I 'm not the only one who hates the MM . I believe both of my brothers have one , and like them , yet I sit down at their computers and get frustrated . Give me my logitech kit any day ( give one of those logitech wireless laser desktop for mac dealies a whirl awesome ) . <p> I agree , its the most uncomfortable and difficult mouse Ive ever used . Right clicking does n't  always work cause you have to lift your left finger off the mouse first , which is very unintuitive . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact that it jams up with gunk is annoying . <p> I never had a problem with the side buttons not working , but I would have preferred it to have two thumb buttons , like the Logitech MX1000 , MS IntelliMouse Explorer , etc . <p> 1 . Allowed clicking of both the left and right mouse buttons . 2 . The side buttons became actual buttons rather than crappy pressure sensitive buttons . 3 . The side buttons behaved as separate buttons instead of a single button in two places . 4 . The side buttons were placed in a more viable location . 5 . If they did a bit more about preventing dirt from getting into the scrollball ( I 've found spraying air into it works better than alchohol ) . 6 . If they allowed easy dismantling of the mouse to properly remove dirt from it . Its a bit unsettling seeing small particles of dirt inside the mouse without anything to do about it . 7 . Fix the sensor problem . I hate left clicks becoming right clicks sometimes . <p> I use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it hurts my hands any , but I 'm not prone to pain in my hands ( I loved lines in school I could do that all day ) so I ca n't be a proper judge of that . I really like the scrollball . I had a mouse years ago that had one , but it was a bit stupid and more prone than the MM in getting dirty . They either need to make that optical or find some way to prevent dirt from getting trapped in there preventing the sensor from picking up a direction or two . Oddly enough I much prefer my Microsoft IntelliMouse Explorer . <p> I have to say I 'm a bit worried , now that I 'm awaiting my tailless MM shipment from California . <p> I suppose I should add that I ordered a customized MacBook from Apple , being a web developer and needing a little more power and RAM , and instead of shipping within the 1-3 business days I was promised ( the latest it should have shipped was Monday ) , I have been gifted and it supposedly is n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ask a few times what the problem was , and both times I was told that it was packaged and the data had been transmitted to FedEx . <p> I was given free 2-3 day shipping the second time I called , and was told to call back in two days if it had n't  shipped . I talked to a supervisor , who sincerely apologized , but gave me $75.00 off the laptop to help me feel better about the inconvenience . <p> Ill definitely post with how it turns out once I get the MM in , though ! <p> Haha , I 've got a friend with one of these and he s got the same problem as Michael Turnwall said earlier ; it wont scroll up . Its also worth mentioning that the mouse in question is about three weeks old . <p> I 've had similar experiences but due to the cost of the MM I 've stuck with it . I had to turn off the side-scrolling for the ball in the middle , got used to the lack of sensitivity on the right click , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the lack of ability to open the darn thing to sort it . <p> If I was thinking about buying one , I 'd think again , everyone Ive spoken to who owns one has had the same problem with the dirt issue . <p> Yknow , I bought myself a diddy little Logitech mouse for my travels some time ago . Its a Mouseman Traveler and when my hand is over it , my fingers hang over the edge . At first it seemed too small but I love the design and feel of it . I 've never actually used it on travels - its my full-time mouse at work on the desk . Now any other mouse seems huuuuuuge and cumbersome . And the mighty mouse might just as well be a house brick . A technically advanced housebrick , mind , but a brick of a thing nonetheless ! <p> Couldnt agree more with this review . My scroll button is toast and the side buttons i never used due to there terrible placement . <p> Personally i like the Logitech G5 Mouse its a gamer mouse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smoothest mouse I have ever used and being able to change its dpi with a handy little button makes it much easier to go in and do those pixel size edits without even zooming in . <p> Ha , great pic . I was so excited when Apple first released the MM , but after buying it I realized its severely inadequate . I always end up right-clicking rather than left and it just hurts my hand after awhile although I guess that was a problem with the original Apple mouse too . <p> I wish Apple would finally put out a slightly ergonomic keyboard/mouse set . Take a hint from Microsoft , but make it look good . <p> Until then , I 'm a sucker for the appearance of my desk and nothing beats the wireless keyboard and Mighty Mouse . <p> I move back and forth between an iMac with an MM and a Linux box that uses a cheap Microsoft mouse . The MM has a nicer feel and is more comfortable to use . However , I never use the side buttons because I 'd need to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but responds to being pushed hard back and forth . <p> That 's a nice honest review . I do n't  suppose you 're going to follow up with a Macbook Pro review are you ? <p> Its the largest laptop Ive ever used and yet they chose to put half-height cursor keys , half-height function keys and a half-WIDTH return key . <p> Oh , and unlike every other laptop in the world , the muppets decided to put the slot-loading DVD drive in the front of the laptop - which is frickin useless if you 're using it on your lap ( i.e. the DVD ejects into your gut which is very uncomfortable when using it on trains , planes and automobiles . ) <p> I tried taking mine back to the Apple store , but as I 'd spent over two weeks giving the keyboard a chance , they would n't give me a refund . <p> Its been two months now , and I 'm still not use to those tiny little keys . <p> Yes , and they are horrible . They are far worse than Apples mice . Its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of crap products , market them well and make some money . The actual product is amazingly cheap , flimsy and just plain crap . Stay away . <p> Regarding my previous review above -&gt; I 've had my MM for nearly 9 months and continue to love it . I do not find the side buttons to be hard to activate and use them on a regular basis to activate Expose . The scroll wheel is such a breath of fresh air compared to other mice scroll wheels , no sticking or wear as of yet . The right click on mine works flawlessly and I love it . <p> Ive been using the MM for months now both at work and at home , and its the best mouse Ive ever used ( mainly b/c I like the scroll ball ) . I never use the side buttons , and Ive never had any trouble with the left/right click detection . <p> Regarding the problems with the scroll pea : folks , it gets dirty sometimes , and you can fix it . Sometimes , when I eat my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the scroller stops working . Just hold it upside-down and scroll back and forth for a bit , and the crud will fall out . If its really persistent , try rolling the pea on a slightly damp napkin . <p> The side buttons are indeed crap . I disabled them within a day . My scroller is inconsistent ( sometimes works , sometimes doesntalways seems to work left and right but only 50/50 up and down and often up but not down or vice versa ) . <p> I have no probs with the left and right click , though . They both work as expected and well . <p> You can easily clean the scroll " nipple " by turning the mouse upside down and rolling it on a piece of chamois . <p> Ive been using a wired model since they came out . At times the left click especially screws up but I like pushing down on the scroll nipple to activate dashboard and mine seems to have worked fine for the entire time I 've had it now that I 've got the nipple clean . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your hand that 's rolling it ( this is true for mine anyway ) it seems to work fine . I agree though , its not perfect but I went from a one button Apple mouse to it and scroll wheels and nipples are hard to live without , I agree . <p> I love the feel of the Mighty Mouse , but the scroll nipple has driven me a bit nuts - you really have to make sure your hands are very clean when you use the mouse ( and do n't  eat at your desk ! ) or it quickly becomes clogged , and it can takes more than a quick rub with a chamois to get it moving again . <p> But the click/right-click thing is just a matter of ( 2 hours ) practice - even my mums got the hang of it - and the side squeezy buttons loosen up after a couple of months . I invoke Dashboard with them , so I do n't  think Im risking RSI <p> The omnidirectional scrolling of the " nipple " is the killer feature for me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bar is really interruptive - I have to leave whatever area I 'm working on and dig around for it at the bottom of the screen . <p> Zoom keyboard shortcuts + MM omniscroll = bliss . Its a major annoyance to go back to my MS scroll wheel mouse and not have it . <p> As for the " side squeeze " buttons , I completely ignore them . The gesture just feels too awkward . <p> I use the original ( corded ) mighty mouse with my ADB Apple Extended Keyboard II . Together , I think they are perfect ( not in looks , perhaps ) and two of the best input devices Apple ( or anyone ) has made . <p> I happen to like the side buttons , the scroll ball , and the feel of the MM in my hand . I couldnt be happier with it . Sorry your experiences were less enthusiastic . <p> Funny . As recently as yesterday evening I decided enough was enough and switched my MM with my Logitech MX1000 . After exactly one months use something mechanical is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sound . On top of that there 's the same issue with the scroll thingy getting stuck . Its just not acceptable . I have Logitech mice from the last century worn from years of use which are functioning perfectly today . <p> I do miss the 360 scroll wheel but its a small price to pay for something that works and the MX 1000 can scroll horizontally so its no big loss . <p> And did anyone mention the ergonomics of the MM ? There 's a chapter to be written on that alone . Did they fire that department at Apple ? Their keyboard is also the worst rubbish I 've tried the last ten years or so . <p> I had the exact same experience as you Dave . The scrollball would jam up almost every day , and I had to solve it by scrolling furiously up and down until the debris dislodged . God knows how much crap has accumulated inside the mouse due to that . The side buttons are too firm to be intuitive , and too sensitive if you need to just pick up and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the button sensors , while a sexy idea , are just not there yet . I would often have to LITERALLY click the absolute edge/side of the mouse button just to get it to understand which side I was clicking . <p> Sexy vs. functional , I 'll have to take the latter . I switched to a cordless black Logitech , which was a REALLY hard decision because anyone who knows my Mac setup knows how " matchy matchy " I am . <p> Now if Logitech would start making Mac-like devices , I think their business would really skyrocket . <p> Had for 3 days then went out and bought a Microsoft Intellimouse Optical . Not fancy but gets the precision job done I need for graphics . Steve Jobs is hung up on his mouse design like George Bush is hung up on Iraq . They just refuse to admit they made a bad decision . <p> I suggest Logitch cordless mice , I have two , and both are accurate , light and multifunctional . I use a Logitech LX7 Cordless at work , and its the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Logitechs dual laser wireless laptop mouse for when I 'm going portable , small , and it stores the wireless receiver in the mouse , which once is in there , turns off the mouse for a simple package on the go . I cant find the model number for the laptop mouse on Logitechs site , maybe they stopped selling them , but I have been very very happy with both . Of course I 'm a PC user so I never used the MM , but I have used apples other mice , and any time I have used a Mac , I always used a third party mouse with them for that specific reason . <p> Apple needs to move on from its blind resistance to multi-buttom mice . It needs to realise that we want a true two button mouse , not one that acts like a two button mouse when it chooses to . The scrolly ball stopped working for me about 3 months after I got my PowerMac at work this year , the only reason I can think of was perhaps a build up of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what appears at the bottom of a mouse after regular use . <p> I finally got sick of this scrolly jamming and went out and got the Microsoft Comfort Mouse 3000 which still allows me to do vertical and horizontal scrolling . Much easier to use and only AUS$40 . <p> I hope the next mouse out of Apple will truly live up to its title , unlike this one . <p> Ive been using the MIghty mouse for quite some time now , and I love it . After some experimenting , and being annoyed with it myself , I found that my left/right click issues were just a form of operator error . If your fingers happen to be touching both sides of touch sensors , then the mouse is easily confused . If however , you touch just one side at a time , the mouse is correct 100% of the time . It works well , but as many are in the habit of resting both fingers on the mouse itself , which you can do on a traditional two-button mouse , I can see how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some trouble with , but not enough to annoy me the way it seems to have others . I would suggest washing your hands before use . <p> And the side buttons ? Sure they 're a little difficult to press , but I seem not to have found anything useful to do with them anyway . I mean really , who needs four buttons on a mouse ? <p> Anyway , I guess my favorite thing about this mouse was the freebie I got from Apple when they shipped it . They accidently put two in the shipping box for me . Thanks Steve ! <p> I 'll take any other mouse any day When Apple released the MM , I thought " Theyre kidding , right ? " . Turns out they werent , but why would anybody get something like that that seems so counter-intuitive ? No actual left and right mouse buttons , but you can left and right click ? I got ta say for the average user , it would seem odd and confusing <p> I 'd rather have a much more intuitive looking and using mouse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ match the decor of the Mac . <p> I really like my mighty mouse , and when the bluetooth version came out I jumped at the chance to buy it . <p> I really like it as a mouse ; so much , in fact , I now have three one for my laptop , one that came with my iMac ( now sitting in a draw ) , and the BT . Love them all . <p> Love them all , but still agree with you . The right button click takes a while to get working ( do n't  know if it learns , or I do ) and the squeeze can go off at inoportune moments ( but then Expose always looks cool ) . <p> I got my Mighty Mouse , and loved it for about the first couple months . The scroll bar then stopped working , and I got another one . I now have the same problem with this one . I still like the mouse , but the scroll ball bugs me since it keeps breaking . <p> I have to agree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever used , bar none . The click detection is painfully inadequate and the scroll-ball is a nice gimmick , but about as durable as a twinkie on the highway . Seriously , the click detection is a massive , massive design flaw . " You just have to learn to lift your other finger ! " , you say ? Your mileage my vary , but I like my hands without carpal tunnel syndrome . <p> And how in the world can they sell a mouse without a scroll-wheel or ball ? When I first saw pictures of the BT Mighty Mouse I thought their marketing department had messed up , I could not believe Apple would sell a mouse without one . That removes 90% of the incentive of using a mouse at all , you can just go back to all-keyboard without that . <p> And do n't  get me , either , started on the side buttons . I 'm pretty sure 90 percent of users pretty much have to turn them , or they activate all the time . <p> I really like the Logitech mouse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the MX1000 . It is a really nice mouse and the new scrolling wheel is tremendous . The only thing Ive found is that the back and forward buttons do n't  always register first time . <p> They also do n't  include the new drivers that you need on the CD - you have to download them ( a slight annoyance ) . <p> I 've used the Apple one button mouse and really disliked it , so Ive steered clear of the MM on the basis that it was too similar - it seemed a compromised solution to avoid admitting that two button mice were best . The Logitech mouse is much more ergonomic ( if you are right-handed ) and I love the extra functionality of the various extra buttons . <p> Right-clicking is harder than left-clicking . And that 's with good reason . Left-clicking is about a billion times more important , as you do it so much more often . If a mouse forces me to use only one or two fingers for left-clicking , I wont buy it . I need to use the whole hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day . <p> The scroll ball will get dirty and needs to be rubbed and cleaned all the time . Yes , its an annoyance . <p> And the side buttons are n't  very useful either . They need too much pressure , but that has a reason too : so you can still use them to lift the mouse . <p> So , some great additions , with a minor problem ( ball ) and a few necessary compromises . I would never go back . <p> I 've used the wired MM almost since launch . I quickly adjusted to the two button arrangement and only needed to clean the scrollball once . Seeing as this is actually my first two-button mouse since first using the Mac over ten years ago , I did n't  really have any major expectations to be shattered . <p> Those side-buttons are awkward and , like many other users here , were switched off within days . Otherwise the mouse is comfortable to hold , the scrollball is very useful and the third button makes a great app switcher . I still use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still kept fresh . <p> My mileage has clearly varied from other folks . I do n't  view the MM as a failure but a typically Apple-like take on a multi-button mouse that can still offer single-button simplicity . Whether it succeeds or fails is really down to the personal tastes of each user , in the same way I prefer wired mice while others love going wireless . <p> My experience with the Mighty Mouse has been the complete opposite of yours - works perfectly , in both right-click and scroll ball functions . I 've had it since not too long after they came out ( its the wired version ) . Love it . <p> Only complaint I have is that the side buttons are n't  as easy to use as I 'd like , but otherwise its been a fantastic mouse . <p> I 've had a wired Mighty Mouse since the day after they came out and a Bluetooth one since they came out , and Ive never had problems with either of mine . I guess everyone does n't  have the same experience . Sorry about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then you must not have ever used a good mouse . I realize that in order to be innovative you have to ignore conventional wisdom , but this thing just does not work . The two buttons on the side are right where you grip causing unintended consequences when you brace your fingers to try an execute a right click without moving the cursor . The right click / left click seems to be some sort of Steve Jobs revenge - he has never liked the idea of right-clicking . It is almost impossible to tell whether the right or left is engaging . While it is possible to train yourself to use the scroll ball - it is challenging . Since it let 's you scroll sideways , you will be surprised when it does . Finally the third button is way to easy to engage . I guess the designers of this mouse have very soft hands and an impercetible light touch . <p> agreed . I returned the MM after a few days . my hand ached for a week afterwards . in my case its simply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kensington Pilot Mouse fits perfectly even if its ugly and the scroll pea is way too small . <p> I have found that the mighty mouse has worked seamleassly . As someone else said after a bit of use the side buttons loosen up and all the added function is a defiinate boost to the mac mouse . It could do with being a bit more ergonomic to the hand but that 's about it . I spend 8/10 hours a day using it on and off and I really have no problems . Speeds up workflow greatly . I have the side buttons set up to expose which means I do n't  even have to touch the keyboard to jump between open applications / windows . The scroll ball works pretty well and after searching online found ways to clean it - so all good . <p> I bought my MM when they were first released and have loved it . I , being the contrarian I am ( and not having anything but a cloven hoof to work with ) , have disabled the right click , making my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The scroll ball has acted up a couple of times from being dirty , but I get a papertowel wet with Windex and roll the ball around on it a bit , which fixes it in short order . My wife still prefers her one single button mouse , and it drives me crazy when I use her puter and do n't  have the scroll ball to use . <p> Just like everything else in this world , the MM is not for every taste , but I think Apple has done a good job with it . If one does n't  like it , its not like its a big deal to get another mouse that works . <p> Let 's face it , Apple does a lot of things right and I am a fan . But when it comes to building a mouse , forget it . Remember the " hockey puck " round mouse ? Garbage , most users threw it away and bought a new mouse . Or tried to sell it on eBay ! <p> I reviewed the wired MM on my blog @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I did not and will not buy the BT MM . I like the Radtech mouse and driver and I recently checked out the new laser Logictech . Both are better than Apples MM . <p> The MM is over engineered and not all that functional . I would not go as far as saying Garbage , but I do not like it either . And I am a long time Mac user . <p> To the other Mac fans out there , it is OK to not like an Apple product once in a while you know ! <p> I have n't strayed from my marvelous Kensington Turbo Mouse for 10 years . Now using it with a G4 Desktop and , when traveling , with my new Mac Book Pro 15 . Virtually never is a problem , needs cleaning about once a year and Kensingtons service is utterly unbelievably incredible . Four buttons and they all work beautifully . Kensington got it right from the beginning and continues to do so . <p> If you are a designer then you should LOVE the Mighty Mouse for one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> First , the scroll ball will let you scroll back and forth in many applications . I use this while zoomed into Flash and could n't live without it . Second , the scroll ball has an acceleration that I have never experienced in any scroll wheel . This allows you to scroll slowly for reading , and then jump from the page top/bottom when scrolling fast . Its amazing . <p> Here are two suggestions to love your Mighty Mouse : <p> 1 ) Clean your nipple , it will work like new . 2 ) Change your mouse settings so that the side buttons do n't  do anything . <p> Not a fan of the MM . I had one , it broke , I found it too small , and the side buttons were oddly placed to me . I much prefer a larger mouse . Its not a terrible mouse mind you , just for some I can understand the annoyances . <p> As an Adobe Illustrator user , it was hard to use . Not very ergonomic . It never felt right . My friend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ follow the obsolete ball driven mouse ? ? ? Maybe the product designers were on something when they designed that part . Minimalist is good . But this one just sucks . I sold mine on ebay when I got a replacement . <p> I agree with the first and last point . I absolutely hate the right click feature . The curvature of the Apple mouse just does n't  lend itself to right clicking . The side squeeze thing is pointless , and I do n't  hold the mouse in such a way that lends itself to squeezing the sides . I must say that I love the scroll wheel though . Once I started using it at work I had to get one at home . <p> I cant stand how most scroll wheels work on Windows , the fact that its one dimensional and one click of the wheel goes down the entire page . They should make them all like this . <p> I had some problems too with my MM , but i want to say that it was realy usefull too me the horizontal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 15,2 " pb on a very wide scan , I do n't  have a large screen monitor at the moment , so that 's why i still like my mm . Anyway Appple shoud make some changes to the mouse . <p> Well , I found this forum , while trying to get instructions on how to dismantle the bloody mighty soap-alike mouse . <p> I am a pro press photographer and bought it having in mind the classic one button heavy-duty mouse . <p> So , I tried using video editing s/w with this , and also began browsing my new G5 mac OS X 10.4.4 ( .7 now ) . <p> I never managed to say one good word from the first day I used this sales gimmick ! <p> USABILITY = 1 ( out of 10 ) ! . <p> Left click gets a real pain as it seems the button can get activated from a tiny height in comparison with a deep click ( fully pressed ) and a touch click ( just because I rest on it ! ) . <p> I never managed to right-click @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ file manager ) as well . Especially when left click is applied once on the white space on the left side of a file . <p> The piece described below is the WORST piece in this construction ! . Tiny piece , you put lot of finger strain to use this <p> The scroll ball ! <p> I used it continuously for upto 9 hours ! , I washed my hands about 11 times to avoid sweat etc. and apart from being able to get irritated because its surface is designed to slip from your hands , I realised after 9 hours of usage it begun mulfunctioning ! . <p> Now , after 3 months of usage , the scroll ball does not scroll down , only goes up ! . No left , no right side bar movement ! . <p> The worst product it came to my hands in my 25 year career using computers ( I was a s/w eng in the past ) ! . <p> I used it the first 4 days of my purchase , only , and it broke down ! <p> I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without damaging it . Impossible ! . A device for single use I would comment . <p> thank you for this site . been using my bt mm heavily since I got it and right clicking was n't a problem until today . I have PCs ( ms wired opitcal mice and a standard dell ) and i go back and forth all the time . scroll nipple , I 've had no issues but the right click , works about 1 out of 10 times now . Like someone said , i had to take any part of my hand off of the left side of the mouse and then click on the right side for it to register right . I like resting my fingers and hand on the mouse . <p> So what did i do ? i turned the mouse at an angle so my hand is about 25 - 30 degrees to the right . my index finger is now real close to the nipple while my middle finger extends to the edge of the right side . I have to curl my hand a little bit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the only way to get a 7 to 8 out of 10 success rate . <p> They need distinct right /left buttons . The side buttons should be clickers too , not pressure sensitive ones . <p> Love mine , been banging on it for 6 months everyday at my job . So , reading this thread , looks like there 's some defective parts out there . RMA a new one . <p> And as far as the clitoris ball , it might be a little too sensative for some applications , but overall my experience using it as a web developer is good . Right click can require some conscious effort now and then , but not a big deal , I think the other features out-weigh the initial behavior adjustment . <p> I loved mine until a couple days ago ! It seems a lot of the time , the right click does n't  work . Or , where I will have to click off an app and re-open it to get it working again . I still use it , but is sucks ! ! <p> I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but that 's because I naturally raise my left finger off the left button when I right click , for some reason . Maybe the people in product testing also had more of a tendency to do this . <p> The multi-directional scrolling is great , but I think I prefer a big wheel for most scrolling . <p> The side button sucks . I like my MS mouse , where I have the independnt side buttons setup as copy and paste . The " squeeze " button sucks for that . <p> One thing I do like about it is the size . I hate big mice . I do n't  paw my hand over the whole thing , rather , I hold it with the tips of my fingers and rest my wrist on the mouse pad the MS mouse is bit too high and can make my hand sore sometimes . This was the only thing I liked about the hockey-puck mouse ; it was small and easy to manupulate . The fact that it had only one button and you could never tell if it was oriented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I went back to Mac with the Macbook , and like the portability so much I resolved to ditch using a mouse , period , and use only the trackpad . <p> Considering I was using an Acer before , the Macbook trackpad is a huge improvement , and now I find using a mouse awkward in comparison to a good big smart trackpad . Its far from the keys , for one thing . And the new Macbook trackpad is big and smart . <p> So when I feel like getting up and working at another desk , I 've got less to carry around .

I 've had one for almost two years and it works flawlesslythe scroll wheel never gunks up , lots of buttons in the right places , comfortable for those 9+ hr days .

I 've gotten more used to the different " buttons " as time has gone on - I think its an adequate mouse , just not really mighty . <p> I too had my mouse stop scrolling up after about a month of use . Thank God for google and the tips on this site . Blowing hard into the scroll ball hole with the ball depressed works for me . Maybe I should vacuum more often ? <p> There is definitely a problem with the right click functionality . I have one and so does my coworker - his right clicking is worse than mine . I 'm not talking about having to take your other fingers off while right clicking , that was easy to get the hang of . I 'm talking about right click functionality disappearing without any rhyme or reason . When it bugs out , there 's no way to get it back except turning the bluetooth off then back on on your mac . Mine works about 90% of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this issue . After all - its like a $70 mouse . For that price it should have headphones and a screen ; ) <p> My scroll ball stopped scrolling up so I was looking for a fix . I read the first few comments got to the one about the stuck scroll ball not scolling up . I used an compressed air duster and blew out the ball it worked ! Maybe a little rubber cement thinner ( graphic artist tool from " back in the day " ) to wipe it down too that has always safely cleaned off gunky stuff from my mouse(s) and mouse surface . <p> Im having to same problem , love the original mouse my iMac came w/ when I bought it back it 2002 , but during the years it being clear couldnt stop the inside picking up lint &amp; dirt so I decided it was time for a new mouse . Went to the Apple store was told no more of the clear mouse , we have the " Mighty Mouse " well to make a long story shortly after about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just scroll up &amp; not down on the page . So I did clean it as what I was told when calling Apple Customer Service it did work for a while now I 'm back to the same old S# ! t w/ the damn thing . NOT GOING TO PAY AGAIN $49.00 . Guess its time to get use to my Wacom Tablet Intuos2 2d wireless Mouse ( never use it because never had to , just use the wireless pen for my graphic stuff ) <p> I use Mighty Mouse both at home and at work and love it . Every once in a while the scroll nipple stops working up or down , but it 's always been easy to fix . Turn the mouse up-side down , then vigorously roll the nipple on a clean piece of lightly-textured fabric while pressing down on it . The fabric removes oils and debris , and pressing down while rolling let 's any trapped debris fall out .

@@99593621 @3793621/ <p> A designers style is made up of a number of different factors , though colour plays a large role . Everyone has their own method of coming up with a good colour scheme , which will inevitably affect the results . <h> Technical <p> A technical method of colour-selection involves choosing one or two dominant colours from the colour wheel , to be used with a small set of complementary colours . Basic colour theory concepts like split complementary and triadic colour schemes offer a wide range of variation , particularly when you start throwing in shades , tints , and saturation adjustments . <p> Pro : An easy way to start with good , workable colour . Con : being too technical can lead to dull and uninspired colour choice . <h> Matching <p> Matching involves starting with an image or an object ( usually a photograph ) and picking colours from within to generate a colour scheme . Boxes and Arrows ran a great article a while ago about selecting colours from nature . <h> Intuition <p> Probably my most frequently-used method . I begin with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appropriate . Naturally my mind computes the corresponding compliementary and similar colours on the fly , but now and then I 'll ignore solid colour theory just to see where it gets me . Hence this sites colour scheme , among others . 30454 @qwx890454 <p> I rely pretty heavily on " eyeballing " colors and perhaps a combination of the last two options you talk about . The color scheme for Asterisk started as selections from a photo . I think it came out alright . <p> I do n't  like going the technical route . One , because I 'm not well versed in color theory and , Two I prefer the creative freedom of doing it based on intuition . <p> The method I 'm most likely to use is intuition . Every now and then I 'll use something like ColorMatch Remix ( http : //color.twysted.net/ ) to find complimentary colors , but I prefer the flexibility that just playing around with a color wheel affords . Even when using something like the afore mentioned tool , I often tweak the resulting colors . <p> Another method that I use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) is looking at other sites . Obviously , you need to be careful not to swipe their entire color scheme , but its a good place to find a base . <p> I always try and use the " naturalistic " approach , or pulling the colors from a photograph or other graphic element to be used . I usually only do this after loading a safety palette . <p> My latest site however , http : //thebrambles.biz has a color palette that is derived from the house itselfthe red being the main color , the yellow the color of the doors , and the blue accent the color of the halls . The brown serves as a neutral to tie everything together ( hopefully ! ) . <p> Oh , wow , awesome . I do tend to go to the " naturalist " photographic route . It just works , you know ? I always do that initiallybut sometimes I tweak it by working with color wheels and what not afterwards if I 'm not satisfied with what I initially got . <p> I came across a series @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ selection scheme . In it , there were " how to " sections on the various styles that were in at the time - Grungy , Techno , etc - and in the Clean section was a tip on making good monochromatic layouts . Start with one color , gray , blue , does n't  matter , make the entire layout in various shades of that color , then add one or maybe two highlight colors to differentiate important items . Although it came from a cheesball resources , that technique has proved useful to me on many a project . <p> I might not be the best source of advice , given my weak ( in comparison to others in this thread , anyway ) design skills , but I tend to use the photograph method . The way I try to get around the " wrong color " problem is to expand the selection area . In Photoshop 5.5 yes , I 'm that far behind I go up to the 5x5 sample size ; in OS X , I use the DigitalColor Meter and run its aperture up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wide as possible , I target the area where I like a color , and get the average of the area . It avoids the problems that can come from posterization , although it potentially introduces others , especially if you have an unsteady hand . <p> Anyway , that 's the method I used to pick the text colors for the mastheads on meyerweb , basing each one on some part of the background image and then lightening or darkening the shade if necessary . <p> I think you cant go wrong with copying nature . Its kinda like having the hand of G-d selecting the color scheme for you : ) <p> One sure way of capturing the colors in a photo for sampling is to generate a color table with photoshop . Open up a nature pic you want to sample . Goto Image &gt; Mode &gt; Indexed Color . A dialog box appears and you can choose many options but the end result when you hit OK is that a previously grayed out option appears under the Mode menu . Goto Image &gt; Mode &gt; Color Table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ image based upon what options you chose when indexing the colors . To prove to yourself that all the colors in the pic are there just click on the eyedropper in the color table and sample a part of the pic you indexed , you 'll see which color it corresponds to in the color table if the preview mode is checked . You can save the color table as a . ACT anywhere and load it later in your swatches palette to use anytime you want . <p> I just thought I 'd mention this as its a more thorough way to capture all the colors in an image than the method mentioned before about pixelating/posterizing it . <p> First , I decide whether I want a warm/bright site , or a colder/darker site ( depends on target audience and what 's being presented , of course ) . <p> Then I choose colors that I feel fit into the category Ive chosen . I make one color that will be used extensively , especially for backgrounds , one color for " brand identity " ( especially in the logo ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ selection M.O . is a hybrid of techniques . But I always begin with a word or phrase like : " Regal " or " Ancient Heroics " used in my Zen Garden Submission : LONG ... or " Feminine Macabre . " I try to force myself to accomplish this step because it sets the " rules " for which I will play by as I progress . <p> Then I try to conjure images that have given me the feeling that the word/phrases representor , if I have no visual memory ( which is rather seldom ) then I hunt for the images . <p> Then once I have the image(s) chosen I take the most vocal and expressive colors in each , form a palette and whittle down and tweak those colors until I reach a solution . <p> Lately , I 've been picking color schemes from what inspires me , which can be the colors of someones shirt , or as of late , from food . Yes , I 've been picking colors from favorite foods such as , chocolate covered raspberries with caramel , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sushi <p> I figure that we visually know if food is appealing to us , and I 've extrapolated that paradigm to picking colors . <p> Once the color scheme is picked out , I go to visibones color lab ( http : **28;2670;TOOLONG ) and play around until I get the right combination that matches technically . <p> I will select one or two colors that fit well together . Then i select one to be the " dominant " color . This is usually the lighter or softer of the two colors . I use the bolder/brighter of the two as accents . Links , headers , and borders seem to show up nicely this way . <p> I then take my dominant color and will grab a shade darker and a shade lighter , so i end up with about 4 colors , but really its only two colors with " screens " of one . <p> For example on my own site , http : //www.jeremyflint.com , I have gone with a sort of " retro red and blue " scheme . I use the blue and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I use the red for accesnts . <p> I 'm not sure how I got started on this type of color theory , but it seems to work well , atleast for me . <p> One thing you can do with the photograph approach , which is always a great approach I think , is to posterize or pixelate the photo heavily . This can make finding the base shades a bit easier . No gaurantee , but it can help . <p> For personal sites I usually just start off with basic white junk witth black content on top and then when I 'm finished with form , I try to get the function thing happening . I get the color theme in there near the end through assuming something might look good with something else . I am usually right , and I should be because I 'm a graphic designer , but sometimes I make ugly things without realizing it . I hope I do n't  assume things while raising children and create monsters . <p> my URL is a bad example , because although I did choose the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apple blue desktop stuff . Its my background , so I snipped it up and threw it in there for filler . That 's why it says its just a demo = ) oh , and I know the spanish is terrible . hehe <p> Not a bad idea . The only flaw is that you 're limited to the dominant colours ; sometimes the colours pulled out of a photo come from just a few pixels of accent that would probably blur into something else . Still , that could work as a nice starting point . <p> One thing Ive done for grabbing colors from photographs is to do a pixel stretch on an area of the photo which has some dominant colors . Then I just magnify the pixel stretched portion in photoshop , grab the colors , and I 'm good to go . <p> Is there a redesign in progress that 's made you think about some color theory , Dave ? Following Digital Webs footsteps , maybe ? <p> I know nothing about color theory ( as proven by my blogs design ) , but I 've always felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for my taste . Almost " heavy " , if that 's possible . What do I know though , I 'm a programmer-type . <p> Funny that you mention that you used no color scheme for this site . I see a predominantly harmonious scheme with some split complements . You are right when you say that intuition is important . It is important not to be scared with experimentation as that is your icing on the cake when designing anything . Still single most important factor of a designers work is " Does the work you make communicate the right thing for what it is made for " . Design , like music can communicate in very special ways and reach feelings unheard of with speech or written words . <p> I often find it tricky to design a colour scheme when I have to work around a client logo or company colours . I often groan when I see their favourite pillar-box red ( looks cool on a truck , but aggressive on a monitor ) . <p> I started out using color theory , complementary colors etc. but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Like you showed how colors were derived from the photos of nature , I do something similar , picking colors off photos of animals , birds , dense forrests , flowers and so . Who else is the greatest artist of all but The Almighty . <p> I took a look at Color Match Remix , and it was cool , but I could n't figure out ( okay , I did n't  try very hard ) what algorithm it was using to choose the colors . So I made my own color scheme generator that uses a number of standard color wheel based methods ( monochrome , triadic , analogous , complementary and split complementary ) . You can find it at http : **32;2700;TOOLONG . <p> I usually start in a white/grey canvas and just play around for half an hour , with some color theory in mind , but no problem when comes to change/rearrange concepts based on intuition . <p> I just never imagined the idea of taking references from a photo ( well maybe i did it unconsciously based on my good photografic memory , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ However I think its a great idea and I will share it , but of course potentially dangerous , maybe not for the result itself but for you , for your creative inspiration that if you never apply with some color intuition may fade in that direction . <p> However i think I will use it sometimes and use a 5x5 color picker and pixelate image , but before pixelate , blur it ( low radius , 10 or similiar ) to avoid that pixelisation can enphatize dark or noisy pixels . <p> Thanks for publishing this and to the commenters ; thanks for all the useful links . For many of us newish web builders , once we are beginning to get on top of the css , we have mental energy to turn towards a more detailed understanding of color and indeed typography . All this kind of stuff really helps us . The real beauty of the blogging mentality is that even homesite builders can see and read how the experts are doing it . It is very hard to think of any other field of endeavour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a new site I always ask the client for any existing design elements that they have and like . I try to use those as starting points to create new color schemes . If I 'm starting from complete scratch , I like using a photo to sample colors from . I generally choose colors using my intuition , and sometimes use online or software based color schemers to aid me . <p> I had never noticed that the sample size of the eyedropper can be changed in photoshop . Thank you to Eric Meyer for pointing that out . <p> its a great pity that ColorMatch does n't  work in my browser of choice ( Mozilla1.6 ) . every time i want to use it , i have to fire up IE , then wait for the nausea to die away before i can play with it : P <p> Why not move out of the realm of nature and into the realm of art ? Pick up some pictures of paintings and let the artists training and intuition work for you . You still have to pick the right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colors can lead to ( I cant believe I 'm going to quote Bob Ross ) " happy accidents . " <p> Haunani mentioned Visibone - sometimes if Im stuck I 'll click on eight random colors , then start by removing the one the clashes the most . Keep removing the clashers and you end up with 3-4 colors that work together that you might not have thought about . <p> I use the Intuition Method . Ill usually start with one color that I 'd like to use , then build from there with 2 or 3 accent colors . My brain just figures them out on its own without any intervention from me . ; ) <p> When I redesigned my companys site at http : //www.amronintl.com I actually ended up with 6 different sites ! I put together seperate mini-sites for each industry and came up with different color palettes for each . However , common elements between the sites ( like the Account Info bar at the top right ) stay the same color throughout the sites . <p> Colors just kind of flowed from throughts about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ similar to OR scrubs ) , tactical is green/brown , military is desert tan . I even got to design seperate logos for each mini-site , again along the theme of that industry . <p> I kept the homepage grey since its the landing point and the source for all of the other sites . The juicy Flash movie gives you a quick overview of each section with a big , colorful photo and a little motion to catch the eye . The photos also complement the colors in each section . <p> Triplecode has a Flash " Munsell Palette " app based on this article and work at MIT Media Lab that helps illustrate its mention in the article above . Its my personal favorite color tool.http : **29;2734;TOOLONG <p> Even after coming up with a carfully crafted palette , I sometimes find that I 'm lacking certain shades when I actually start styling the site . I use the Color Blender LONG ... ) to find , for example , a shade that 's between the blue Im using for links and the gray Im using for the header . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be inspired by anything and too many things can confuse too , Happens all the time with me , then i rely on softwares to do the intial judgement and use my mind to do a fine selection . <p> I love color , and flipping through Pantone swatch books is a favorite pastime of mine . All that said though , personal preference plays a big role in a couple of ways . <p> There are certain colors that I am naturally drawn towards ( yellow and orange for instance I 'm sure you 're shocked ) . I tend to use these colors a lot in my personal work . However , given the nature of a project , I will intentionally choose colors I am not as personally fond of , simply to stretch my awareness of color . <p> I do look for color a lot in nature and in cultural heritage as well . I enjoy finding Asian , South American , and European art and architecture a great source for color inspiration . <p> Beyond that , and this is truth , I ask my wife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and have three of the 4 colors picked . I 'll ask her to pick a 4th , and invariably shell come up with the most amazing color that I wouldve never chosen on my own accord . <p> Know what colors you like , then learn to branch out drastically at times . <p> I really enjoyed the article . Although I know CSS pretty well , I 'm a programmer - not a designer so , by my own admission I have no taste . I 've taken your idea of natural colors to heart ( site uses colors from banner image at top ) , combined it with Dan Cederholms mountaintop-corners and made a pigs ear of the whole thing at http : //www.xanadb.com . In its defense , the markup is clean and minimal but it still looks like its been designed by a programmer . Just goes to show <p> p.s . Not sure I like the new proton scheme , but then again - who am I to judge ? <p> Working in art so many years color choices are part intuition and part formal training it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , picking something just outside the predictable range produces some excellent results . <p> On a flip side , I also apply color theory when I am planting my gardens . Purples against Greens , Oranges against blues or purples , etc . So , though color can come from nature , color theory can be applied to natural areas or settings to produce some lively effects . <p> Look at art for examples , too . Sometimes , I will ask a particular client what types of art they find compelling , to get a feel for the way their tastes run . Check master works like van Gogh ( whose work with opposites produced many lively and memorable pieces ) , Gauguin ( some exciting combinations ) . Pissaro , Renoir , Manet , Monet for subtle impressionistic tones , and too many others to list , each fitting into some sort of *color climate* . <p> I once read a tip about color choice for others that had to do with looking at what they buy , wear , or how they decorate their surroundings .

@@99593623 @3793623/ <h> Archive for July , 2009 <p> I spent the better part of this past week trying my hand at creating a decent-looking recursive tree , in between all the sweating this heat wave is causing . <p> Maybe its the heat but I think I 'm ready to throw in the towel . I got the recursion working reasonably well , but the branch curves look terrible , and most of the logical adjustments I wanted to make ended up in division by zero for some reason I could n't track down . <p> Like , a for loop starting from zero and incrementing i on each iteration ; I get that for the first iteration i = 0 so youd think this equation should work , right ? <p> variation = multiplier / ( i + 1 ) ; <p> But no such luck . " Division by zero " error . My actual code is more complicated of course , but that 's the essence of it ; the loop is just not behaving as I 'd have expected . <p> So I think for now its time to put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Shame , I had some interesting things I wanted to do with the trees eventually . <p> I 'm back to dots again . This time Im stacking them in an orderly cube , and with the random palette some of them look pretty darn good . <p> I cant get this one exported into anything usable in a browser for some reason ; the applet that Processing creates just does n't  want to run . I suspected the photos I 'm using to generate the palette are to blame , but after hitting up the troubleshooting guide I appear to be doing everything right . The main symptom ( aside from not running ) is that the exported applet is only sized to 100+100 in the browser , which is a ) wrong and b ) strange . <p> Anyway , in lieu of something you can play with , here are some screen caps : <p> If for some reason you really really trust me , you can download the native applications Processing generates ( Mac OS X , Windows , both around 2.5MB ) and play with them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your computer , but , they should n't . <p> ( Use the mouse to rotate the cube , press a or z to zoom in and out or the mousewheel , but that 's buggy and you can kind of drag it up and down to reposition , though that does n't  work well either . Hit the spacebar for a fresh palette . Oh , and s will save out a PNG of the current frame if you 're so inclined . ) <p> So after yesterdays Bezier celebration I thought I 'd try a more structured approach and see if I could n't capture some interesting movement . Reducing the number of objects down to 3600 and plotting them along a grid as a start , I got the end points and curves moving along Perlin-assisted paths in kind of a wind-blown look . <p> Still all in 3D space of course , so I saved out a quick capture with some viewpoint shifts and generated palettes . ( With the latter you can pretty clearly see that not everything that 's generated is usable since I have to cycle through a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bezier curves are hard enough to get the hang of in a graphics program with visual handles , but plotting the handles in 3D space is a whole new ball of wax . <p> I played around a bit tonight with about 80,000 of them by rotating from the origin and randomizing both the endpoint and the end handle of each curve with Perlin noise . The results are neat : <p> By keeping track of the coordinates of each line I can manipulate the entire blossom in 3D space , though at 80,000 lines its a pretty slow refresh . I added an animation loop too , to get each line swaying a little ; it works well with a few thousand , but not when the numbers get this high . <p> I 'm also sticking with this photo-generated palette idea ; its a great way to get a bunch of interesting colours in a hurry that do n't  clash too badly . I 've upped the photo pool to 10 , and one is selected randomly each time the palette is generated . Each of the above examples only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to whatever ; the previous example used something like 25 . <p> Okay , the generated palette idea was easier than I thought . Importing the photo into an off-screen buffer and grabbing some random pixel values makes for a fairly quick and easy way of generating an interesting palette . here 's the photo : <p> Ive been playing around with a variation of the radial sketch from my last post that plots a few thousand ellipses along a Perlin-randomized trajectory . I first spent a bit of time converting the ugly coordinate arrays to a cleaner object array , added a custom palette , and then added a bit more control over the view in the form of mouse-enabled 3D rotation and mousewheel zoom . <p> I 'm not done with this sketch yet , I 'm going to try generating a random palette from a photograph if I can get that working . For now here 's a dump of some of the more interesting stills : <p> I 've started light by simply merging some of the sketches from last months workshop . That has mainly meant translating 2D demos to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some interesting OpenGL quirks . <p> This applet ( requires Java Virtual Machine ) for instance ; there 's a clear dividing line between the left and right half ; the lines are darker on the left , lighter on the right . This is true no matter whether I use the lights() function or not . No idea what 's causing it . <p> And 3D shapes appear to be slow as molasses . Admittedly I 'm on a MacBook Pro with only a mid-range graphics card , but I 'd expect better results than this . here 's a basic 25 sphere " starfield " , it renders pretty smoothly : <p> But bump it up to 125 and look out : <p> Keep in mind the previous applet draws about 5000 2D lines per cycle , vs. the 125 spheres in the last video , so 2D shapes are clearly a lot less taxing than 3D shapes . But 125 shapes is barely scratching the surface of what I imagined Processing could accomplish , so I 'm clearly missing something . <p> What do the pros do ? I 'm guessing the choice is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movie , or fake 3D with 2D objects . Ill have to keep digging into this one . Update : aha , buffering . <p> ( and actually , now that I 'm looking at the movies again , I 'm wrong those are n't  even spheres , they 're just ellipses . No idea why this examples so bad ; I can normally get a few thousand ellipses moving pretty quickly , I guess this is just a crappy example . The point remains when applied to spheres though . ) <p> About a month ago I filled a seat at Vancouver local Jer Thorps monthly workshops . The topic of the day was Processing , the open source graphic and interaction programming language . <p> Coming from a web background , I 've long been meaning dip my toes into more advanced coding + design environments , and Processing sounded like it perfectly fit that bill . Though it was also geared at non-programmers , Jer teaches his workshop at a comfortable pace for someone with my background too . I ended up spending less time than others fighting my way through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my own tangential experimentations . <p> Here are a few of the results from that day . At some point Jer mentioned the save() function that would spit out PNG images , so I made liberal use . <h> Structure Sketch <p> Probably the second example of the day , we built a fairly basic demo to get comfortable with the integral setup / draw functions . The loop drew a rectangle at the mouse coordinates ; I took it a bit further and applied some alpha and size variation based on mouse position . Nothing terribly complicated ; the image below is the result of manually " drawing " a bit during the loop . <h> Scribble Sketch <p> Again using the basic setup / draw functions , we worked through some of the basic stroke and fill properties as well as the random function by drawing more interesting line shapes on mouse press . I saved out a bunch , here are three of my favourites : <p> Again , this was mostly manual mouse drawing , with a bit of randomness thrown in . <h> Random Numbers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Perlin noise in our randomization . With the noise function and a bit of radian-based math at my disposal , I tried a few different variations on a theme . <p> The last jellyfish/loofah-like shape was one of my favourite outcomes of the day , so its the current masthead for this site . <h> Ants Sketch <p> After a Les Amis du Fromage-catered lunch we spent some time learning about basic objects and methods , something that admittedly is n't a concept I 've found easy to grasp in the past . Maybe not so much grasp , as figure out how to put into practical application . I 'm dangerous with arrays , but classes and methods never really struck a chord with me . <p> The demo involved creating an Ant class and propagating the canvas with a few hundred ant instances . It does n't  make for a very interesting visual result so I 'm not posting a capture here , but I 'm hoping that Processing is finally going to be what gets OOP to make sense to me , and that I 'll be able to use the principles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <h> Images &amp; Pixels , Simple 3D , and WFF Sketches <p> We finished the day with a bit of a breakneck tour of the " where you can go from here " concepts that were probably more inspirational than instructional . Using a photo ( and then webcam input ) we coded a basic eyedropper tool to select the colour value of a specific pixel ; we played around in OpenGL and 3D space with a few spheres ( I went a bit further and tied in some of the mouse interaction and animation routines we 'd learned earlier in the day ) ; and we ended with a brief overview of using data off a public API to do interesting things with the We Feel Fine project . <h> Takeaway <p> I left with a pretty good overview of what Processing can potentially do for me ; the trick is to now take the basic principles we learned last month and start putting them into practice . The next few posts will likely be me working through some simple visual and interaction concepts as I get up to speed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shift into 3D space , as I 've spent the better part of ten years thinking in only the two dimensions the web allows .

I 've upped the photo pool to 10 , and one is selected randomly each time the palette is generated . Each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I can change that number to whatever ; the previous example used something like 25.

While adapting one of my previous sketches , I stumbled on this neat marble effect that I 've been playing with for a few days . Though it started as a happy accident , its good enough that I think I might actually take this one further and produce some sort of tangible item . <p> But that 's going to take some time and research . In the meantime , here are a few conveniently wallpaper-sized images Ive saved out , feel free to nab one for your desktop
