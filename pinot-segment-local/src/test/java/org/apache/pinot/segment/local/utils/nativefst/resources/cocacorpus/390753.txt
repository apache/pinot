The North Atlantic saw the first large-scale whaling enterprises , first from Europe and then from North America , and as more coastal stocks became depleted the fleets sought their prey further afield to supply the market that they had created . <p> Oswald Walters Brierly 's watercolour painting ' Amateur whaling , or a tale of the Pacific ' , 1847 . The painting depicts a dramatic nineteenth-century whaling scene in Australian waters . <p> ANMM Collection .

There are oft-repeated tales of right whales being so plentiful in Hobart 's Derwent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the local residents awake with their noisy spoutings . A few years of whaling solved both of these problems and it was only in 2012 that a right whale with a calf was seen again in the Derwent . <p> Whaling in the South Pacific : operations on board an Australian whaler . Engraving by Albert Fullwood , 1893 . <p> ANMM Collection <p> Just as in the north , the whalers first depleted the coastal stocks of whales then used the new colony as a base for more distant forays " especially to the south . In Western Australia and Queensland , however , coastal whaling stations remained operational well into the 1970s , reliant on the seasonal migrations of humpbacks and sperm whales to and from Antarctic waters . The advent of large-scale industrial whaling in the early 20th century , with huge factories and factory ships being fed by fleets of catchers , led to some efforts to provide some certainty in supply to the companies that were engaged in whaling . <p> This was the beginning of the International Whaling Commission ( IWC ) , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of whale stocks and thus make possible the orderly development of the whaling industry ' . The initial focus of the IWC was on maintaining the whaling industry " there was still a misplaced view that ocean stocks were unlimited and could be exploited forever . Despite the disastrous collapse of most of the world 's whale stocks there was opposition from some countries to the establishment of the moratorium on commercial whaling that the IWC adopted in 1986 . <p> Today , despite the moratorium , some countries such as Norway and Iceland hunt large whales within their territorial waters , and Japan , notoriously , has exploited a loophole in the convention to undertake scientific whaling ' in the Southern Ocean . Scientific whaling is allowed under the convention where it is necessary to obtain data that can be used in the management of whale stocks . <p> The Japanese ship Yushin Maru capturing a minke whale . Exploiting a loophole in the law , Japan has controversially continued to kill whales in the name of research despite the International Whaling Commission 's ban on commercial whaling . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ research ' program 's killing of more than 10,000 minke whales over the last 25 years , there has been no attempt to use any of the data collected for management purposes . Instead , the whale meat is sold for human consumption , although this is allowed under the convention . It is hugely expensive to hunt whales and the economic returns are small . Now that the worldwide whale-watching industry is worth over two billion dollars a year , and growing fast , living whales are worth far more than dead ones . <p> Minke whales aboard the Nisshin Maru , a vessel of the Institute of Cetacean Research , a Japanese organisation that engages in whaling <p> CREDIT : TIM WATTERS/SEA SHEPHERD <h> Progress and protection ; conflict and threats <p> Many stocks of whales are making a recovery now because they have been protected from hunting since 1986 .

The recovery of others , like the blue whales , is less certain and numbers are still critically low . Monitoring the recovery of whale stocks is extremely difficult " particularly in the open ocean " and when the stock is already very small it is harder still . But we are in the middle of a grand ecological experiment , because if we allow whales to recover to anything like their former numbers this will have a major impact on the marine ecosystem . Will this result in the whales eating all the fish , as proponents of whaling insist , or will it result in richer more productive ecosystems , as recent research is suggesting ? <p> Young whales , such as this humpback calf , start life with a cocktail of toxins inherited from their mothers , who tend to accumulate a burden of toxins and pollutants that are passed up the food chain , increasing in concentration with each step along the way . <p> Image : SHUTTERSTOCK <p> As whales recover , and under the protection of the moratorium , other threats to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the ecosystem and they tend to accumulate a burden of toxins and pollutants that are passed up the food chain , increasing in concentration with each step along the way . Mothers pass these pollutants on to their offspring so they start life with a cocktail of toxins including organochlorines , heavy metals and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons . It is thought that these toxic substances may be responsible for the development of tumours and reproductive and immune system failures later in life . We can measure the toxic load through non-lethal approaches , but understanding the long-term effect of these man-made chemicals is more difficult . <p> A greater abundance of whales also results in increased encounters with humans , and this can be positive " the massive growth in whale-based tourism , worth over $300 million to Australia every year " or negative , through interactions with infrastructure or shipping . Migrating whales get entangled with fishing gear , and vessels , large and small , can damage or be damaged by collision with whales . Perhaps most insidious is the increasing , though invisible , noise pollution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ activities and oil and gas exploration . Whales rely on sound for communication , navigation and finding food , and increasing noise levels may well interfere with these critical activities . All of these conflicts need to be managed to ensure healthy whale populations as well as healthy maritime industries . <p> Noise pollution from oil and gas exploration can interfere with whales ' biosonar . <p> The changing climate will also affect whales directly " but mostly indirectly through their food supplies . Most projections suggest that a warming , more acidic ocean will not be good for either krill or fish , which is bad news for whales . <p> It is difficult not to be slightly concerned for the fate of whales in a future ocean . There is a range of factors that seem stacked against them : over-fishing , resumption of commercial whaling , pollution , entanglements , ship strikes and ultimately climate change . Yet at the same time , many populations of great whales are demonstrating their resilience by returning from the massive over-exploitation of earlier centuries . We are learning more about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to understand their critical role in the ecosystem .

In fact , enough of the Salem whaleship 's hull was extant following its loss that Francis Coffin " who purchased the wreck for -305 at auction in July 1840 " attempted to lease it as a storehouse to the first European settlers to inhabit what would become the town of Bunbury . By 1842 Samuel Wright was still in sound condition , although its back was broken as a consequence of sand being scoured from beneath the bow and stern . <p> In 1842 , surveyor Henry Mortlock Ommaney laid out Bunbury 's town plan . He used the tallest and most conspicuous landmark then in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ town 's streets and property boundaries .

Of note is that the hull of the former is shown largely intact , although only its mainmast remains in place and the bowsprit has been shortened . By contrast , North America seems to be a relatively new wreck with all three of its masts complete and still standing . The North America wrecked in 1840 appears to have largely broken up and disappeared from view by 1843 , so there is every likelihood the latter North America is the one shown .

Their buried lower hulls , by contrast , became encapsulated in a preservative environment that was cool , dark , waterlogged and oxygen-deprived . This coincided with development of Bunbury 's port infrastructure , which culminated in the creation of a stone breakwater along the bay 's northwest periphery in 1896 . The breakwater disrupted natural currents and longshore drift , which in turn resulted in sedimentation and accretion of the shoreline at North Beach . Between 1896 and 1936 , the shoreline expanded approximately 200 metres north of its pre-1896 location , burying the wrecked American whaleships " and remnants of ten other vessels lost between 1843 and 1903 " under an additional three to six metres of beach sand . <p> North Beach 's many shipwrecks might have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that took place in the area beginning in 1956 .

Under this mandate , one of ANMM 's primary objectives is to monitor , assess and maintain a cathodic protection system installed on the submarine in 2014 to ensure its continued preservation . The cathodic protection system is a network of three pods ' comprising several sacrificial anodes made of zinc . Each pod weighs approximately 1.5 tons ( 1,361 kilograms ) and was connected to AE2 in order to prevent further corrosion of its hull . <p> One of the anode pods that comprise the cathodic protection system installed on the AE2 shipwreck site in 2014 . <p> Image : Sel+uk Kolay/Kolay Marine , Ltd . <p> When metal surfaces come into contact with electrolytes , they undergo an electrochemical reaction known as corrosion . Corrosion is the process by which a metal returns to its natural state as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chemical structure to weaken . Iron or steel that is submerged in seawater is one example of a metal coming into contact with an electrolyte . Under normal circumstances , a steel object " such as AE2 's hull " would react with the surrounding seawater and begin to corrode . Over time this would result in its complete disintegration . <p> Sacrificial anodes are highly active metals that are used to prevent a less active material surface from corroding . They are often created from zinc or magnesium , which has a more negative electrochemical potential than the metal it is used to protect . The anode is connected to the metal it is protecting and consumed in its place , hence the sacrificial ' designation . If given enough time anodes will completely disintegrate and disappear . As a consequence , they must be changed at regular intervals . <p> Active corrosion of the anodes comprising AE2 's cathodic protection system indicates it is functioning as intended . <p> Image : Sel+uk Kolay/Kolay Marine , Ltd . <p> An inspection of the cathodic protection system was conducted via @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The purpose of the inspection was to gather data from monitors attached to the cathodic protection system , review the corrosion rates for each anode pod , and determine whether they were working as designed . An ROV-mounted probe designed to acquire corrosion data from the monitors unfortunately failed ; however , the ROV 's cameras acquired video footage and still imagery that showed the anodes were clearly corroding . Further , the level of anode depletion was greater in the submarine 's aft and midships sections , where the concentration of iron and steel internal structural components " such as the engines " is more substantial . This correlates well to the manner in which the cathodic protection system was predicted to operate and indicates it is functioning as intended . <h> Exhibition and Interpretive Initiatives <p> Transfer of responsibility for AE2 's ongoing preservation and interpretation to ANMM coincided with the development of the Museum 's newest exhibition space Action Stations . A sub-section of Action Stations is devoted to maritime archaeology and historic Australian naval shipwrecks , so it was only logical that AE2 should be included @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is used as a case-study for identifying shipwreck sites in a touch-screen digital interactive .

Action Stations also includes an infographic panel that discusses in situ preservation of historic shipwrecks , and graphically illustrates the manner in which the cathodic protection system is currently being employed to stabilise AE2 's hull and associated artefacts . <p> AE2 's forward periscope pedestal as it appeared in 2014 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which indicates neither were damaged by shellfire from Sultanhisar . Image : AE2 Commemorative Foundation / ANMM . <h> Moving Forward <p> Still and video imagery of AE2 acquired during the 2014 archaeological survey has provided a unique opportunity to test historical accounts of the engagement between the submarine and the Ottoman torpedo boat Sultanhisar . For example , Sultanhisar 's commander , Captain Ali Riza , claimed the torpedo boat 's opening salvo struck AE2 's periscope from a distance of approximately 2000 metres ; however this is not corroborated by existing accounts of the submarine 's officers and crew . Close examination of site images and footage does not show evident damage to either of AE2 's periscopes , both of which are fully retracted . Indeed , it is highly unlikely that the damaged periscope could have been retracted at all had it been struck directly by shellfire . These findings appear to contradict Riza 's account , and are but one example of a number of contested events during the AE2Sultanhisar engagement that may be clarified with archaeological evidence . <p> The anodes that comprise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and eventually must be replaced before they completely disappear .

In the meantime , AE2 will continue to be preserved where it lay , protected by an army of zinc plates and the deep , dark waters of the Sea of Marmara.

@@77262380 @5962380/ <p> SPIRIT OF AUSTRALIA is an Australian designed and built jet-powered , wooden , 3-point hydroplane built in Sydney by its owner and driver Ken Warby MBE in 1974 . It has held the world water-speed record since 1977 , raising it to 511kph in 1978 at Blowering Dam near Tumut NSW . It is one of the few surviving examples of an Australian built speed record holder . <p> DescriptionOn 8 October 1978 , Australian Ken Warby stunned the speedboating world by breaking both the 300 mph and 500 km/h barriers , claiming the outright world water speed record for a second time . His record endures , despite several challenges which have ended in tragedy . <p> Warby was the first person to design , build and drive a boat to a new world water speed record-and on a shoestring budget . He first claimed the world record in 1977 , taking his home-made hydroplane to a speed of 464.44 km/h and breaking American Lee Taylor 's ten-year-old record of 458.98 km/h . But where Lee Taylor 's record had cost close to $1 million in 1967 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ military-surplus jet engine that cost $65 ! In 1978 he returned to Blowering Dam in the southern highlands of New South Wales and pushed his record to 511.11 km/h ( 317.68 mph ) , where it still stands . <p> The remarkable thing about Spirit of Australia is that almost anyone with reasonable building skills could put it together . It is a home-built wooden boat , using stringers , brackets , stock bits of timber , plywood , screws and epoxy . What stands out is the builder 's logical approach to the project . He did not know the answers to many of the problems he expected to meet along the way , so he followed a path on which he could learn as he progressed . He started with a shape based on his knowledge of hull design , built the basic hull and tested it , then went on gradually to explore the problem areas and search for the solutions . <p> Ken Warby is a genial , confident and easily approachable character whose casual manner does n't entirely hide his extraordinary genius : an intuitive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ km/h you are travelling 139 metres per second , and one kilometre goes by in seven seconds . These are speeds that rip a boat to shreds if something goes amiss . Instinct is needed not just to survive but to learn-video footage at those speeds is a blur lost in spray , so no-one knows exactly how much of the boat is in contact with the water . Ken Warby sums it up by saying ' You do n't drive the boat , you wear it . ' <p> An experienced amateur designer/builder at the time he started out on what he called Project 300 , to break the 300 mph barrier , Warby was inspired by the water speed record holders of the 50s and 60s when record breaking was fashionable . As a kid he made a model of the great British land and water record breaker Sir Donald Campbell 's last Bluebird and ran it on the local pond with a tiny ' Jetex ' engine . He designed , built and raced his own power craft before he was old enough to visit the speedboat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A mechanical engineering qualification and practical workshop experience at the local steelworks added a solid grounding , but what he knew about hydrodynamics and aerodynamics came mostly from practical experience . His philosophy was ' KISS ' ( keep it simple , stupid ) , and Spirit of Australia 's design and structure reflects this 100% . <p> Spirit is a three-point hydroplane , well established as the type for high speed racing and speed records . The concept of the planing hull with widely separated sponsons forward of midships was patented in 1938 by Adolph Apel and his son Arno in the USA . At speed the hull lifts and planes on the two sponsons and the aft end of the hull . The wetted surface of these three points of support is minimal , and the shape let 's air under the hull to create additional lift . At record-breaking speeds there is very , very little boat in contact with the water , making directional control and stability a problem . Most dangerous of all , lift under the nose can lead to a catastrophic somersault-the thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Warby describes Spirit in an offhand , affectionate manner as ' a box around the engine with skis , ( shaped ) to go through the wind right ' -and indeed it evolved from a simple hull , sponsons and uncovered engine into a refined , streamlined record breaker . Its proportions initially came from the size of the engine , the length of the cockpit , and ' enough nose out front to line it up on the course ' . <p> Why did he choose wood as his material ? Warby had built his previous boats of wood so he had the skills , and he knew a timber structure could be robust and sturdy . Aluminium , fibreglass or composite structures can have a strength to weight advantage over wood but Warby wanted a bit of weight in the hull to keep it from taking off . Wood also suited his budget , and would be easy to modify as the project went on . <p> When Ken Warby put his thoughts on paper in 1970 , working on the kitchen table at night , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lift offsets for the hull and sponsons . As designer and builder the structure was in his head ; he did not need to draw it , just do it . Later he sketched over the plan with outlines for a tailplane , air inlets and a windshield that would eventually be added . <p> His ' box ' took shape first around two main longitudinal members of solid timber girders , surrounded by transverse bulkheads with a floor , side frames and deck beams . On the centreline at the bottom is a flat keel . Chine logs , stringers and a solid wood transom complete the framework of Oregon and spruce which is covered with marine-grade plywood , laminated with Dynel cloth . The sponsons are built onto the hull and their structure is similar . Just forward of the cockpit are the airspeed fitting and a cleat-even the world 's fastest boat needs to be towed or tied up ! <p> But how do you support a powerful jet engine and keep it from parting company with the boat ? The twin girders became engine beds supporting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engine is slung . For steering , a mild steel rudder blade and quadrant was securely bolted to the transom , linked by heavy cables to a wheel in the cockpit . Behind the sponsons were stainless steel fins acting like skegs to give the rudder something to push against . <p> Spirit of Australia was launched for trials in 1974 , looking rather agricultural with neither tailplane nor windshield . Warby sat in front of the uncovered engine in an open cockpit , wearing a crash helmet , goggles and a big smile as he set an Australian record of 267 km/h . He deduced that the centre of gravity should be further forward at higher speeds and he moved the engine forward . He also knew that the time had come to seek technical advice about the things he needed to push the boat much faster . Air intakes , a windscreen and engine cowlings would reduce drag from the engine and pilot , while a tailplane and a planing shoe-the third planing surface at the aft end of the hull-were critical to lift the stern and correct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's self-taught confidence mixed with trepidation when , in 1975 , he sought out Professor Tom Fink and his assistant , Dr Laurie Doctors , at the engineering faculty of the University of New South Wales . Professor Fink had done wind tunnel testing in London for the designers of the last Bluebird , and asked Warby to make a test model for the university wind tunnel . To the Professor 's surprise , Spirit 's apparently crude design was more aerodynamically stable than Bluebird , and was theoretically capable of achieving the desired speed . The less stable Bluebird had lifted off and looped the loop , killing Sir Donald Campbell in 1967 . Fink showed Warby how to design his intakes and what area was needed for the tailplane , and continued to advise as the project went on . <p> Warby made his tailplane by riveting an aluminium skin around the ribs and tips of a Cessna 172 aircraft . It was mounted on a steel framework , the whole tailplane pivoting fore and aft so the angle of incidence of the horizontal ' wings ' could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speed record boat to fit such a stabiliser . Professor Fink would have preferred a wider span and narrower chord for the tailplane , but the Cessna parts were all Warby could get at the time . Not only that , they were within the maximum 2.44-m width legally towed on the roads in the state of New South Wales , a very practical consideration ! <p> The shoe under the hull , the aft planing point , was a long , narrow wedge of wood finished with fibreglass . Warby felt that the tailplane was ' too mushy ' as a control surface , and that the shoe would be a much more positive influence in raising the stern and pushing the bow down . Further trials confirmed this , as he gradually increased his Australian record while working up to his first successful attempt on the world record , in 1977 . The attention this first record brought him helped him secure a $60,000 sponsorship from the swimsuit manufacturer Speedo , and more help from the source of his engine , the Royal Australian Air Force . Other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like to drive Spirit of Australia at such speeds ? Only Ken Warby really knows , as no one else has ever driven the boat . Warby says he always felt comfortable and unthreatened , able to drive with two fingers on the wheel . He says 300 mph is much the same as 200 mph , except that the end of the dam comes up much faster . Exactly what is in contact with the water is uncertain . Undoubtedly the rudder and fins are , and probably the extreme aft ends of the sponsons and shoe should be providing planing support . Unfortunately the spray thrown up under the boat hides the truth ! <p> Film footage shows no hint of pitching . This rock-steady profile comes from a delicate balance of factors countering any lift up forward . The boat has weight , and its centre of gravity is a short distance aft of the sponsons . The sponsons are angled to lift gradually and to straddle any ripples or small waves on the water . The nose is shaped so the airflow across the deck pushes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the centre of gravity also gives the nose a slight downward push . So does drag from the wedge-shaped rudder , pulling backwards below the centre of gravity . The shoe also lifts the stern . The fixed tailplane increases its angle of attack if the nose rises and this increases lift at the stern , pushing the nose back down . In fact the combination of forces acts like a see saw around the centre of gravity . <p> What really disconcerts observers is the slow sideways oscillation at top speed that Warby calls ' sponson walking ' . Rolling through about three degrees from side to side over two seconds , this is another delicate balance of forces whose significance was only learned through many trials . The rolling motion releases air pressure which builds up under the hull and could flip the boat . The roll is induced by torque from the engine and subtle shaping of the shoe , and it can be adjusted by positioning the fuel load to reduce it to what Warby calls a ' gentle ' motion . But to someone watching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adamant that the search for mirror-smooth water is wrong . Rippled water-75 to 100 mm ripples running down the course-is ideal . The ripples aerate the contact surfaces and reduce drag . Warby says he lost 50 km/h in mirror smooth water , and the increased drag on the sponsons as they ' walk ' from side to side induces an uncomfortable yawing motion not evident on rippled water . The emphasis is on ripples-at 500 km/h you do n't want to hit a wave , and between runs you have to wait for the wash to dissipate . <p> For official records , Spirit 's speed was measured over one kilometre of a 13-km course . There is an accelerating run up and acceleration continues through the measured kilometre . The speed is measured as an average of two runs over the same course , one in either direction , taken within a period of one hour . Beforehand volunteers go out and pick up any debris on the course . Spirit once collided with a soft drink can during early trials , the boat sank as it came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Westinghouse J34 WE 34 Turbojets were booster jets from the RAAF 's Lockheed Neptune anti-submarine aircraft . In 1970 a friend told Warby about an Air Force disposal sale and he bid for two jets at $100 each . To his surprise he got them , so he incorporated them in the final design . Later he bid for a third at another sale and this one only cost $65 . Declared unserviceable , it was put aside for spares . During his first world record attempt in 1977 a screwdriver which had probably been left in an intake went through the turbines , ruining his good engine and the screwdriver . Warby was forced to use the sick $65 engine in that first record-breaking run , even though it had much less thrust than the original . <p> The only way to get greater speed from this less powerful engine was to reduce drag . Professor Tom Fink calculated that a 50 mm reduction in rudder depth would be enough , but Warby realised that it would also reduce his margin of safety because that drag was a factor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ risk , and in a farmer 's shed in the rural countryside where the record attempt was taking place he took an oxy torch to the rudder . Just to be sure he took off 65 mm . It was a rough cut which visitors to the Museum can still see today . The boat handled well despite the shorter rudder , and he had his first world record . Sadly this did not make much impact in the Australian media even though the event was recognised internationally . <p> Warby describes the second attempt in 1978 describes as a ' cakewalk ' , just a matter of ' running the numbers ' . He had managed to swap his sick engine for a better one at the nearby Air Force apprenticeship training base , and they also gave him technical support . His jet ran smoothly with plenty of power and gave him his 300-mph and 500 km/h prizes-but not without some drama . On 7 October the weather was deteriorating . He had started in relatively calm water but part way down the course when he was up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into waves . Leaping off one , Spirit landed badly . Warby was tossed around in the cockpit and the tail mounts broke . That night while others were partying in anticipation of a record the next day , Ken was back in a farmer 's barn fixing his tail mounts until late at night . On 8 October he went out and broke the record . And this time he made the news locally and internationally , winning the title MBE ( Member of the British Empire ) . <p> Ken Warby is immensely proud of his boat , but a little protective about its details . He realises that his simple approach could easily be copied , and he does not want to give away to much too easily . After his record he did some more trials out of curiosity , to test an afterburner that had been installed before the record attempts but failed to work . When it was put into action it gave the boat a significant jolt but Warby kept in control , and even today he is a little coy about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ further he has preferred to wait and see if his record might be broken by someone else before trying again . Lee Taylor and then Craig Arfons , both from the USA , tried separately in tragic attempts . Both drivers died when their boats went out of control at speeds below his existing record . <p> The Australian National Maritime Museum acquired Spirit of Australia ten years after the record , buying it from Warby with financial assistance from the 1978 record sponsor , Speedo . These days Warby is happily established as a resident in Cincinatti Ohio , the intervening years filled with racing jet cars , jet trucks and a jet hydroplane , ' having fun and getting paid for it ' . He has also just built another boat . Twenty years down the track Ken Warby says he 'll attempt to break his own record , with a new wooden boat . Instead of an open backyard and garage to build in , he now has a well-equipped shed as a workshop . <p> What did the neighbours think back in the 1970s , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with some used jet engines stored under tarpaulins ?

But Ken Warby had the mark of someone with a good feel for what is right , separating him from the average person the way a sporting champion has that gift of timing or co-ordination that puts him in the elite level . Warby knew that by following a well thought out , logical and cautious approach , he would meet and overcome the various obstacles ahead and put his name up with Gar Wood , first through 100 mph , and Sir Donald Campbell , first through 200 mph . <p> And so he became Ken Warby MBE , first to break 300 mph on water in the Spirit of Australia , a simple wooden boat with performance like no other . 73935 @qwx693935

Shipwrecks were common in Australia 's early history , with the loss of hundreds of lives .

Lighthouses under current Australian government management include one of Australia 's oldest lighthouses , located on Tasmania 's Swan Island " which will be 170 years old this year . <p> Tales of shipwrecks abound through Australia 's history , and many lighthouses were built as a result of numerous fatal shipwrecks .

For some time , both towers stood together . <p> Courtesy AMSA <p> The very first beacon to warn mariners was believed to be built at South Head in Sydney in 1793 , only five years after the arrival of European colonists .

Each day before dusk , men across Australia left their cottages to ascend a familiar spiral staircase , set the light going by winding it up and pumping the kerosene , maintaining it and watching it throughout their watch . This occurred night after night , in still weather and in the midst of the worst storms that the sea could throw against the nearby shores . The lighthouse prisms also had to be cleaned at least once a fortnight ; it took two men the best part of a day to clean and polish both sides . <p> When the Australian colonies federated in 1901 , they decided that the new Commonwealth government would be responsible for coastal lighthouses " major lights used by vessels travelling from port to port , rather than the minor lights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of control occurred on 1 July 1915 , when the Lighthouses Act 1911 came into effect . <p> When the Commonwealth of Australia officially accepted responsibility for all landfall and coastal lights around Australia , these included 103 manned lights .

@@77262405 @5962405/ <h> Bombed Ships and Dumped Struts <h> Bombing of Darwin <h> Beneath the waves <p> During the latter half of 2012 I was invited to participate as a consultant in an archaeological assessment of submerged heritage sites in Darwin Harbour . I was in the final throes of completing my doctoral studies , and " as is common with those transitioning from full-time studies back into the working world " desperate to re-establish a toehold in my chosen occupation . The work in Darwin was associated with a much larger project to develop a Liquefied Natural Gas ( LNG ) onshore processing facility on the East Arm of Darwin Harbour , and involved comprehensive maritime archaeological surveys of areas of the harbour floor located within the development footprint . Because the project was carried out to commercial standards , all maritime archaeologists working underwater were required to hold an occupational dive certification . I did not have an occupational ticket , and so was one of several staff archaeologists responsible for documenting and assessing artefacts that were brought to the surface for analysis and identification . <p> Sketches were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Harbour . This example drawn by the author shows part of the rudder pedal mechanism from a Consolidated Catalina flying boat . <p> Image : James Hunter . <p> Within the East Arm itself are remnants of six Consolidated Catalina flying boats . Three were assigned to the U.S. Navy 's ( USN ) Patrol Wing Ten , and three were operated by the Royal Australian Air Force . The USN aircraft were responsible for conducting reconnaissance and patrol duties in northern Australian waters , but were caught at their moorings when Japanese aircraft attacked Darwin on the morning of 19 February 1942 . Three Mitsubishi A6M Zero fighters strafed the Catalinas during the first wave of the assault , causing two to sink almost immediately . One remained afloat and was ultimately destroyed by a Japanese dive bomber . Incredibly , no loss of life occurred with any of the American aircraft , although one was undergoing maintenance at the time of the attack , and its ground crew was strafed on at least two separate occasions . <p> Small artefacts associated with the upkeep of Catalina aircraft were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The grease contained within this grease gun was still useable , despite being on the seabed for 70 years ! <p> Image : James Hunter . <p> Today , all three USN flying boat wrecks are located on the seabed where they sank and are in varying states of preservation . In 2012 , one of our goals was to assess the overall condition of each of these sites , and make recommendations for their long-term management . We were also tasked with documenting the seabed within the Catalina mooring area , which contained evidence of their operation and upkeep . Artefacts associated with these activities included hand-pumped fire extinguishers , grease guns , an array of tools , and damaged aircraft components . Most were likely discarded on purpose , although more than a few were probably lost overboard by accident <p> Darwin Harbour also contains the wrecks of American military vessels , as well as Australian ships employed by the merchant marine during the Second World War . The highest loss of life of any vessel attacked during the Bombing of Darwin was that of the American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " including one that detonated the ship 's forward ammunition magazines . The damage to Peary was extensive , and 88 officers and ratings perished with the vessel , but incredibly some crewmen returned anti-aircraft fire at their attackers until the raid ended . Two other American military vessels , the troop transports USAT Meigs and USAT Mauna Loa , were also attacked and sunk by Japanese dive and torpedo bombers . Thankfully , the loss of life was significantly less aboard these ships " only one Meigs crewman was killed as a result of the raid , and all of Mauna Loa 's complement of 44 escaped unharmed . <p> In an effort to obtain an overall picture of the current condition of Peary , Meigs and Mauna Loa , each was documented with multi-beam echo sounder ( MBES ) in 2012 . Ironically , the superstructures of all three wreck sites were removed by a Japanese salvage company during the 1950s , but their lower hulls were left largely intact and undisturbed . Consequently , both Meigs and Mauna Loa still retain portions of the military cargoes they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , motorcycles , military trucks , gas masks , small arms , and various types of munitions . Peary 's salvage appears to have been much more comprehensive ; in addition to its missing superstructure , very little evidence exists of its armament or propulsion system . Only a scattering of small artefacts have been observed atop the seabed within the surviving hull , but additional material could still be present within buried hull sections that have remained largely undisturbed . <p> While quite a bit is known about the Bombing of Darwin and the immediate and devastating effects on Allied ships and aircraft it left in its wake , far less attention has been paid to other military activities that occurred in and around the harbour " both during the war and ( especially ) following its conclusion . Among the many hundreds of artefacts I documented during my time with the project were tools , car jacks , automobile engines , aircraft parts and iron bed frames of Second World War vintage .

Wartime expediency would have dictated that broken and irreparable items be quickly cast aside and replaced , and for those working on and around Darwin 's shores , the harbour would have been a vast " and obvious " choice for a dump site . <p> One particular instance comes to mind . I was responsible for documenting two landing gear struts and a wingtip section from a Supermarine Spitfire fighter aircraft . The struts showed clear evidence of damage ( likely from a hard landing ) , and the wingtip was pierced by several large holes . While I initially thought these might be bullet impact marks , closer scrutiny revealed they were rectangular-shaped rather than round ! In the end , the solution to the puzzle came from two other finds I was responsible for documenting . The first , a wing float from a Catalina , featured several similar rectangular holes . The other comprised several iron pickaxe heads that were found among a larger scatter of tools littering the seabed . It soon became apparent that the cross-section of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ From this , we determined that a pickaxe was intentionally used to puncture both the wing float and wingtip in an effort to prevent them from floating and becoming a hazard to navigation ( or , at the very least , washing up somewhere along Darwin Harbour 's shoreline ) . <p> The author with a small Second World War-era automobile jack recovered from Darwin Harbour . Concentrations of these jacks were often found scattered on the seabed among tools , aircraft components , and other artefacts . <p> Image : James Hunter . <p> Ultimately , it 's discoveries like this that are the true stuff of archaeology . Objects such as the Spitfire wingtip have interpretive value in their own right , but when examined within their broader context and in association with other artefacts , a much more interesting story emerges .

The museum also acknowledges all traditional custodians of the lands and waters throughout Australia , and pays its respects to them and their cultures ; and to elders both past and present . <p> Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander watercraft are Australia 's original boats . Designed and built by local communities with tools they made themselves , using the materials of their region and having a shape that responds to the craft 's use and to the capabilities of the materials , they are unique to this country . <p> They could also be surviving examples of one of the earliest forms of boat ; their simple and in many cases elegant structure often contains only the essential components needed to make a craft that can be navigated with purpose and control in a variety of sea conditions . Even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ platforms controlled by the whim of the current and wind . These Australian Indigenous watercraft could be a living examples of the origins for the evolution for boats . <p> Not every community used watercraft , however many used the water for travel and as a means of sourcing food , and they often developed quite specific craft for the task . A canoe based culture could have existed in a number of places where the boat was a primary means of fishing , hunting and transport . Their vessels were used on all types of waterways from billabongs , rivers , lakes , and estuaries through to bays , island groups and the open sea along Australia 's coastline . This range of conditions in combination with the varied communities and their own distinct natural resources has allowed a huge variety of different canoes , rafts and devices to be developed . <p> Although the primary type used in numerous locations around the continent is a bark canoe , other types of canoe construction such as dug-out logs , bundled reeds and layers of bark are also employed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many Indigenous communities . In the Torres Strait and Cape York areas , outrigger craft were common . <p> The known distribution shows that craft were used around the coastline and adjacent rivers and lakes from Victoria up to Queensland and across the top of the continent as far as the Kimberley and north-west Australian coast line . It appears there were no craft in the south west quadrant of the continent . The major inland waterways formed by the Darling and Murray systems also had many craft . <p> Physical evidence of many of the regional variants within the craft types has probably been lost with the erosion of Indigenous groups and their culture since European colonization . The nature of their construction using natural materials also resulted in vessels with a short lifespan before they were abandoned and left to decompose . <p> It is evident from a study of those craft that have survived along with craft still being built and used is that the craft 's use , design and construction relate very closely to the area . There is also evidence that where Indigenous groups @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SE Asia , and Papuan or Melanesian cultures from the north , this contact brought further development to the design and construction of some of the Indigenous craft . The relatively recent colonization by Europeans was also another source of influence and short term evolution in some areas . <p> WATERCRAFT CONSTRUCTION : <p> When Europeans made contact with Australia , having sailed across open oceans in relatively complex sailing ships that were one of their pinnacles of technology for the period , the Europeans assessed the craft of the Indigenous Australians as relatively crude and simple , a view that persisted with colonization from the late 1700s . <p> The relatively rough and basic appearance of these craft masks a much more sophisticated series of steps in their design , construction and use . An examination of Indigenous water craft reinforces how Indigenous Australians shared an extremely close association with their local environment . What appears to be a simple craft quite often has a much more complex background . As well as a thorough understanding and empathy for the environment in terms of the materials for construction , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be used , the building and use might also incorporate aspects of a community 's hierarchy and structure . <p> There are no drawn plans for the design of these craft . The materials , the sequence of construction and the proportions of the craft were not recorded in any written form by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities , this information was held as knowledge by people within the community . This knowledge was the plan , and was continually passed on from the older to the younger generation , through the process of building new craft , and even with model making and toy canoes . This was a regular cycle or occurrence as new craft were needed to replace older craft that had deteriorated as a natural process . Over generations the short lifespan of many craft often meant that the knowledge was practiced every year and perhaps even more than once each year . Therefore the ' plan ' for the craft remained in regular use .

Eucalypt species were commonly but not exclusively used . Melaleuca and other similar loose bark trees were also a source of material .

Pegs were an alternate method of connection , fashioned from another appropriate wood source . Some canoes are made of more than one piece of bark . The joints are sewn together with fibre strands . Clay , mud and natural resins from trees , plants and even insects are used to seal some joints , or additional bark material is sewn to help make the craft watertight . Many of the construction techniques can be seen in use in the construction of other implements used by Indigenous people , even simple items such as a bowl . <p> The proportions and shape are a combination of the material 's properties and capabilities , combined with the purpose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ canoes called gumung derrka or nardan and used on the Arafura Swamp wetlands in eastern Arnhem Land by the Yolngu people , and in particular the Ganalbingu and other neighbouring clans . Their purpose was to allow the clan to hunt magpie geese and collect the bird 's eggs in the swampy grasslands during their nesting season . Anthropologist Donald Thomson had visited the area in 1937 and described the canoes and the hunting . These craft were featured in the recent movie ' Ten Canoes ' which was inspired by Thomson 's image of the canoes being poled through the wetlands grass . <p> The half cylinder section of stringy bark is soaked and treated with fire , inverted so the smooth surface is on the outside of the canoe , and then set up between two posts driven into the ground acting as a simple jig or former . At the aft end the edges are fastened together with fibre strands . The bow is more detailed and became a distinctive feature . It is cut back and sewn together along the top edge to form a long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part and push through the wetlands grass . With the addition of branches located across the hull to spread the sides and act like beams , and fibre strands from edge to edge holding the sides against the branch beams , a relatively stable hull is created with a buoyant forward end that was ideal for storing the magpie geese eggs and speared geese . <p> A similar pattern of design requirements is repeated on other indigenous vessels . The kalwa double raft from King Sound area in the north west of Western Australia and used by the Bardi people is a two part structure of logs and stands out as another intriguing example of the use of available materials . It is built of mangrove wood , and these trunks taper with a significant swelling at their base . The cleaned and shaped logs are fastened together with wooden pegs , and arranged with the larger ends beside each other , giving each of the two parts a distinct fan shape . The aft section is then lapped onto the bow section . <p> The craft are well adapted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be a semi-submersed state , the arrangement remains seaworthy due to the distribution of the buoyancy or flotation of the logs . In the middle , lapping the two ends gives a double layer of logs that puts flotation where it is needed to support the weight of the person or persons aboard . The fore and aft ends have considerable buoyancy by themselves due to the volume of the larger ends of the trunks . The waves will still pass through the craft in the narrow space between each log , but the buoyancy in the thicker ends helps the raft negotiate the waves instead of pushing straight under them . <p> There is another part to the Bardi raft 's story . The lapped arrangement of the two halves becomes a vital element when they are used for hunting dugong . Dugong are speared from the raft , and the point has a tether attached so that it is perhaps more accurate to describe it as a harpoon . Once a dugong is speared and then dives in a frantic effort to escape capture , the hunter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raft , and separate this half from the other one . While the hunter remains on his half , the dugong tires itself swimming away tethered to the other half of the raft , and eventually the exhausted creature can be recovered . <p> The evolution of each design must remain speculative . The first inhabitants of the mainland arrived by some sort of watercraft 50,000 to 60,000 years ago , so the concept of a watercraft was already in their background . <p> Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander cultures feature a detailed and accurate observation of their environment and the particular cycles of nature within that environment . This guided them in their quest for food , shelter and in their patterns of movement around their territory . Observing the nature of local waterways and the qualities of materials available and sharing this knowledge as a group could lead to the genesis of very simple craft such as floatation devices used to assist them as they swam in the water . Perhaps simple items like this these were then refined by experience and observation until they became a basic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ became a boat which could be navigated with purpose to where the person wanted to go , rather than relying on a current or conditions to take it along . Further steps in the development would improve the simple vessel until a standard pattern emerged . This then remained in use , unchanged . It must be unlikely that the examples seen today were created in their first instance in their final and complete configuration . Some process of development starting from a more basic item is likely to have occurred , and over an unknown length of time the more complex craft evolved until it was satisfactory for its purpose . <p> The construction of Indigenous canoes often shows an arrangement of panels and support common to craft throughout the world . On many canoes the bark skin will have its edges reinforced with branches that form a gunwale or inwale timber , while further branches can be used to form beams or even a triangular cross-bracing configuration . Some items work in tension , others in compression . The Yolngu derrka canoes have four or five fibre strands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beams , and these strands are a near equivalent of tie-rods found on many modern wooden vessels . The strands are cleverly secured so that that can be easily tightened . <p> The inside of a canoe may be stiffened along the bottom with additional bark panels , and joints between pieces of bark can be sealed with natural resins , gum or other material . All these individual parts may have names , and while the craft will have its own name as a type specific to each community , there is evidence that in some groups it may be given its own individual identity as well . <p> The simplicity of some of these hull structures which have been made from a single sheet of bark with as little as one internal brace shows that the Indigenous Australians were in fact well acquainted with monocoque or near-monocoque forms of construction . Monocoque , ( French for single shell ) is a technique where the panel of an object is made strong enough to absorb the structural loadings with minimal or no internal supporting structure . It is generally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and car construction in the 20th century . Recent developments in composite fibreglass construction have seen the method successfully adopted in vessel construction . However it could be that for hundreds and perhaps thousands of years the Indigenous Australians were building monocoque watercraft by forming bark with heat and water to produce a hull shaped shell that only needed two or three beams working in compression to hold the sides apart . <p> The outrigger craft from Cape York and Torres Strait are quite distinct and relatively complex , and show a close association with craft from Papua New Guinea and the Louisiade Archipelago at New Guinea 's south east tip . The main hull is a hollowed-out log , while the double or single outriggers , their beams and connections are smaller logs or tree limbs , held together with rope made from fibres . Throughout Cape York the craft within each community share many features but also show detailed variations on the eastern and western sides of the cape . The outriggers found in the islands in the Torres Strait are quite large . A number of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carried sails , and were capable of long passages on open water in the area . <p> WATERCRAFT USE : <p> Indigenous craft are poled or paddled along , by one or more people . Poling is done standing up , and sometimes the pole is also the spear to be used for fishing . Paddling is done seated or kneeling , using a typical blade and handle , a hand held blade without a shaft , or just hands , and sometimes a combination of both . Many craft carried a small fire built up over a base of wet mud or clay . The fire was used to cook fish as they were caught and provided warmth . <p> A casual observation of the craft suggests many were only capable of being used in enclosed and relatively calm waters . However many craft including those made of bark were capable of going offshore for short or long passages of many kilometres in the skilful hands of the Indigenous paddler . There are many reports from early European explorers and colonizers noting that the craft were seen some distance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could have many uses rather than being specifically related to one task only . Clearly hunting , fishing and food gathering is often a priority , and some craft are built and used solely for that purpose , perhaps even only for a brief period each year . However the nature of the indigenous lifestyle for many generations would see groups moving within their own territory or beyond their normal boundaries , often in accordance with the fluctuating seasons and food sources . Voyages could be short regular transits or longer and almost migration style passages , undertaken as groups or individuals . This travel and transport would use one of the obvious pathways available , the different waterways and waterway systems throughout the country , and were not just restricted to the coast and major rivers . The wet season or prolonged wet periods throughout the country would fill swamp and perennial creek systems for long periods , making them accessible . These routes and the map of the landform were also maintained as knowledge , paintings and ceremonial practices . <p> Conclusion : <p> Indigenous people on other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simple but effective watercraft , which later became quite complex and refined structures . Many of the concepts and details used in their creation are common to craft around the world , but created without necessarily having had any contact with other people to influence their construction . <p> The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people are understood to have one of the oldest histories of civilization , and migrated to Australia through South East Asia following a route that inevitably involved short sea passages between islands made on unknown rafts or other vessels . Having reached New Guinea they could move overland to Australia as there was a land connection at this time , which is about 50 to 60,000 years ago . However there is speculation that some early arrivals may also have made what was then a shorter passage from Timor to the Kimberley coastline by raft . Once people had reached the continent they moved to all parts of the coast and inland . As far as can be ascertained they remained isolated from other influences with the exception of the Torres Strait , Cape York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible that Indigenous Australians came to the country with a background of very simple marine vessel construction and use , developed in the course of their migration . They may have one of the oldest histories of the construction and use of watercraft , created largely in isolation from other developing civilizations , and practiced over countless generations as the many Indigenous communities lived within the changing Australian environment . When the first people arrived and populated the land around 50 to 60,000 years ago the coastline , environment , flora and fauna were quite different to what now exists . From that time onward until the end of the Ice Age there was a continual change to the environment , which was quite dramatic in some instances . The population moved in response to these changes which stabilised around 7,000 to 10,000 years ago . The diversity and nature of watercraft that existed earlier still remains largely unknown . <p> The Indigenous water craft that can be identified now are suited to the resources and characteristics of this relatively recent environment , and maybe they are only a product @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their primary quality .

Originally named VARG , it had been built by Anker and Jensen in 1924 . Lord Forster raced it for two seasons and was successful at Cowes Week in the Isle of Wight , England before he sold it to Alexis .

The ANMM and SHF are developing the ARHV to document and survey surviving historic craft and to encourage their preservation in the community . They can be operational or preserved on land and promoted as significant items of local interest . The ANMM has an historic boat collection but does not have sufficient resources to acquire and manage more vessels at this stage .

The form can be filled out by someone other than the owner . <p> Q : How old does a vessel have to be if it is to be nominated for the ARHV ? <p> A : The vessel should be built before 1970 , but exceptions are created for vessels after this date if they are considered significant . This date is a management tool and will change as the Register develops over time . <p> Q : What gives a boat the significance to be nominated for the register ? <p> A : The nomination form lists four areas in which a vessel can have significance .

Enquiries can be made through shipwright listings in the yellow pages , class associations and boat clubs . <p> Q : What are the priorities or guidelines for a restoration project ? <p> A : The ANMM and SHF encourage people to retain as much of the original structure or integrity of the vessel as is practical . If restoration work is required , we encourage work that identifies a particular time or event in the vessel 's history and tries to configure the vessel to that point in time .

@@77262424 @5962424/ <h> Clinker Speedboats <p> The clinker or lapstrake speed boat , ski boat and runabout has developed into a type of boat common to Australia , where a particular shape of hull has been followed to make it quite different from speed boats in other parts of the world . <p> Origins : <p> The initial origins are obscure , and whilst there is a clear development in the post World War II period , there is evidence of craft built and raced a little earlier which have some of the characteristics that are typical of the class . One of these is the racing speed boat ZOOM , a clinker hull with veed forward sections that gradually decrease in deadrise to the transom . The stem has a shallow rake and there appears to be some tumblehome in the transom section . This craft was racing successfully in 1940 . <p> The Australian clinker speed boat has no direct connection to any overseas design or influence on the shape . The concept of wooden speedboats or runabouts was common in the USA and Australia , but the round @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ characteristics of the craft is a design developed in and almost unique to Australia . The initial development may have occurred in the late 1930 's , possibly based on carvel or diagonally planked hulls ; however the beginnings of regular production of these craft are post WWII . In the USA there is a clinker workboat style hull called the Jersey Sea Skiff , built in the 1940 's which was also raced , but the design has not evolved in the way that the Australian design has . Critical to their development was the fact that they were also racing craft , with a fierce competition , which is still active . It was claimed that these were the fastest racing displacement boats in the world . <p> Significant Builders : <p> There were three main manufacturers of clinker ski boats , Lewis , Everingham and Hammond , all in NSW . Elsewhere there were others who made just a few boats or had small turnover . These include Winton , Seacraft Syndicate , Simpkin and Brian Storm . <p> Lewis Bros had the greatest volume of production @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Taren Point NSW . The brothers then split , one went into fibreglass production , the other Frank , went to Huskisson NSW and continued building wooden boats , but was killed in a motor accident in the mid 1970s . <p> Bert Everingham learnt from his father and established a business building runabouts after WWII , working on the Hawkesbury River NSW . His turnover was not as great as Lewis . Bert 's son Malcolm became a boat builder as well and currently builds fibreglass hulls , and one of Malcolm 's sons is now also entering the trade . This brings the total to four generations that have built runabouts and ski boats . In 2005 Bert Everingham built a wooden hull from old moulds . <p> Both Lewis and Everingham had employees to run a small production based concern . They were rivals on the racing circuit , and like car makers or makes , had their own groups of followers who made disparaging comments about the other builder 's craft . Everingham followers referred to Lewis boats as ' leaky Lewis 's ' . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hammondcraft in Brookvale NSW , who built boats from the late 1940s onwards . He had no employees and only built boats to order . They were very high quality and considered the superior version or Rolls Royces of the class or type . Consequently his turnover was quite small compared to the other two builders . <p> Design and Construction : <p> The competition between the builders ensured the type evolved with new engines ( always inboard mounted ) and a gradual evolution of the hull shapes , whilst retaining the clinker construction method . The hulls had a generous rake to the stem often around 45 degrees , which rounded into a straight keel . The forward sections were quite veed , and then the dead rise decreased back to the transom with a very shallow vee or even a flat bottom at the centerline . The bilge section was quite firm , and this would be very obvious at the stern where most craft had tumblehome put into the topsides .

The rudder hung off the transom , and there was an additional skeg for directional control forward of the middle sections . <p> They were planked in various timbers , usually around closely spaced , small sectioned frames , with big bearers or girders running full length to mount the engine . The decks were plywood , often grooved and filled to look like planked decks with a wide covering board . Wrap around wind shields protected the driver and passengers . Racing boats were more extreme in their shape than the recreational craft , which had to include a passenger cockpit aft of the mid mount engine . In the racing boats the driver and mechanic were often positioned close to the transom with the engine well forward , giving a shallow angle to the shaft line and propeller thrust . <p> Racing was well supported through out the country in classes based on the engine size , such as the 225 and later 255 cu . inch class . 45 to 55 mph was fast for the early 1950s , whereas modern day craft can do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , better suited to the hull shapes than rough water and swells .

@@77262427 @5962427/ <p> MAY-BELLE was the flood boat and ferry on the Palmer River at the Palmer River goldfields in Maytown , Queensland , a short distance inland from Cooktown on the coast . It is a relatively rare example of a late 19th century floodboat , a craft that was available on many rivers throughout Australia in the early days of settlement , and remained in use until bridges were constructed . People depended upon the craft for transport , supplies and mail during times of flood . MAY-BELLE was built by Sutton and Gay in Brisbane , most probably in 1895 . It features the use of an unusual material for a craft just under 4.70 metres long . The riveted form of iron or steel plate construction contrasts with the typical wooden construction of a vessel of this type . However it is an appropriate choice of material for the location and intended use , and is an excellent example of an unorthodox but correct method of construction for a vessel . Its use as a flood boat , ferry and even possible recreational activities helps interpret the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a gold rush in the last quarter of the 19th century . <p> DescriptionMAY-BELLE was designed and built c1895 to ferry passengers and small amounts of cargo such as mail and supplies across the Palmer River at Maytown ( north Queensland ) in times when the river was in flood and could not be crossed by any other means . The passage was about 200 metres over water up to six metres or so depth , and relatively fast flowing . This required an open boat fitted with thwarts for seating and rowing as the logical choice for the period , and similar boats were used in many locations for this purpose all around Australia . MAY-BELLE has a conventional dinghy or waterman 's skiff style and proportions to its 4.66m length , giving it a nice sheered hull profile , rounded stem and angled transom . There is a hollow toward the keel in the bottom sections aft that forms a keel toward the transom for steering control . It has been identified as a close sister ship to another flood boat in Coen ( HV000546 ) on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it shares virtually identical dimensions , the same shape and same construction method . <p> MAY-BELLE has been built in thin gauge iron or steel plating on angle bar frames . This choice of a heavy material is slightly unconventional , because typical craft of this type would have been made in wood , either carvel or lapstrake planked . However , the dry inland environment for much of each year , where the craft would have remained out of the water for long periods would have been unsuitable for a wooden craft , which would have opened up at the seams whilst out of the water . It would not have been usable immediately when required as the seams take some days to swell and close up again . It is also possible that the extreme nature of the dryness could have caused the wood to split making the craft unusable . Therefore the choice of a metal plated hull seems quite suitable , with the only major issue being corrosion or rust . However , the likely service life expected was measured in years or a decade or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to holes could be plated over if needed . A metal hull would also be more resistant to damage , and the many dimples and deformed areas on the existing hull show how it could absorb the damage but remain intact , even though the surface became somewhat misshapen . A metal hull could also be more easily repaired , as the skills required were within a blacksmith 's trade , a common occupation throughout inland locations . <p> MAY-BELLE has a very simple layout . It is an open boat with no decking . The bilge is completely open , and there may have been floorboards across the frames to keep cargo clear of any bilge water and act as a sole to step on . Four thwarts are fitted , and the forward two have rowlock holes . No oars or rowlocks exist that relate to the craft . Whilst it is clear MAY-BELLE could have been rowed which is the natural form of propulsion for this type of craft , the strong current raises the question as to whether there was a cable or flying fox between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to keep it from being taken downstream from where it was to land on each shore . According to one source it used a set up below a bend , which had a steel/iron stake hammered well into the ground . This was used to hold the boat 's bow upstream while it was pulled across by line , which allowed a greater load and fewer crew to be aboard . <p> MAY-BELLE 's early details are still being researched , and the first reference to it comes in the North Queensland Register 8 May 1895 . Reporting on a flood on the river and accident to a mail coach , the story notes that the existing ' Divisional Board Ferry boat ' was lost in the torrential river flow , and then went on to state that a new one was already available . <p> " Fortunately the Board has a new boat ready at the LAURA , only awaiting transport . Our indefatigble Chairman took prompt action to have the boat brought up . The boat comes from the well-known firm of Sutton and Gay , Brisbane , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' <p> This was the Palmer River Goldfield Divisional Board , and they were the original owners of the vessel . <p> Mary Callaghan was a resident in Maytown and recalled having rides in the boat as a child and that it was stored in a shed and had a winch and a trolley to launch it into the river . Her mother stated that in 1911 when another flood occurred , it washed the vessel downstream a couple of miles before it could be recovered . At this time it may well have belonged to a subsequent regional authority . <p> Maytown was finally abandoned in the late 1940s after the last person living there departed , but it had been virtually deserted and no longer active for many years beforehand . <p> How and when it was named is not yet known , but when MAY-BELLE was recovered and brought to Cooktown Doug Keeble who had knowledge of Maytown understood that it was called MAY-BELLE and that name has remained with it . <p> MAY-BELLE was discovered in 1973 by a group of teachers who had remained in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ returned to Cooktown .

Understanding the significance this vessel had as an artefact of the Maytown gold mining period , Darcy Gallop returned to Maytown with a couple of council workers , and using a 3 tonne truck and winches they removed the vessel from the scrub and brought it back to Cooktown . He then replaced the thwarts with new ones , and painted the outside .

@@77262430 @5962430/ <p> ANTONIA is a pearling lugger that was built in Queensland in 1956 by Norman Wright and Sons . It is one of the few surviving late-period Thursday Island pearling luggers and it is closely connected to the final period of pearling operations in the Torres Strait area . ANTONIA represents the end of the evolution of the Thursday Island pearling lugger as a sail-rigged working craft . <p> DescriptionThe pearling lugger ANTONIA ( pronounced ' an-TON-EE-a ' ) was built at Norman R. Wright 's yard in Bulimba , Brisbane in 1956 and designed by Norman 's son Ron . ANTONIA is carvel planked and the design has many of the characteristics of the typical Thursday Island lugger , including the relatively plumb stem , long keel , gaff-ketch rig , and an elegant yacht-like sheer line . However the long counter has been shortened to fit a transom board for economy of construction and to reduce the problem of dry rot experienced in the poorly ventilated longer counter sterns normally associated with these designs . <p> The arrangement is also typical of many luggers , with midships @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a low cabin was the only accommodation space . On deck a hand-operated winch was mounted well forward , and just aft of this there was a hatch to the forepeak .

After the launching , Zafer , with Phil Rose , sailed and motored the boat north to Thursday Island to begin work . Zafer had secured his marine pilot 's license specifically for the voyage . <p> To everyone 's surprise , the original Gardner engine turned up some months later , having been retrieved from the grounded ship and forwarded in unknown circumstances .

It was a very effective collaboration . <p> The two craft then worked the pearling fields in the Torres Strait for almost two decades . ANTONIA was the fastest lugger to operate in the Torres Strait and was incorporated into Torres Strait Islander culture and history in traditional songs which survive to the present .

@@77262440 @5962440/ <p> GRAFTON is one of the oldest surviving Torres Strait pearling luggers in Australia . Built on Thursday Island by Japanese shipwright Tsurumatsu Shiosaki in 1907 , one of the many Japanese involved in various aspects of the Australian pearling industry , it is one of a handful of luggers from the early 1900s which still survive in its original hull form and hull structure . GRAFTON represents the beginning of the second generation of the distinct Thursday Island style of pearling luggers , which evolved from the yacht-like designs of the 1890s . These designs established a new direction in Australian lugger design . Many of this second variant were built by Japanese shipwrights , and manned by Japanese crew who dived for mother-of-pearl shell . GRAFTON cost A-450 to build and was first registered in Townsville to Burns Philp and Co . <p> DescriptionGRAFTON was built by Shiosaki in 1907 . Like many of the Japanese involved in the pearling industry he was based at Thursday Island and is known to have built a large number of luggers on the island . GRAFTON is carvel planked and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repaired and modified but the original hull shape and construction remains intact . Many early pearling luggers were substantially rebuilt during their working lives , creating a virtually new boat , especially when an engine was added . In GRAFTON 's case the only alteration visible was cutting an aperture in the deadwood for the propeller , one advantage of having a deadwood keel rather than one planked down the sternpost to the heel . <p> First registered to Burns Philp and Co. , GRAFTON was sold to Wyben Pearling Company in 1913 . This was a subsidiary of Burns Philp , established to operate the pearl shell business at Thursday Island . GRAFTON remained active as a pearling lugger in the Thursday Island fleet until World War II . During the war it suffered the same fate as other luggers and was taken over by the Army and used in the Torres Strait area , with the number AL 263 . Owned by the Commonwealth Government during the war , it was sold it back to Wyben Pearling when wartime activities ceased in 1946 . In 1947 GRAFTON was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Wyben Pearling subsidiary .

Burns Philp retained ownership until about 1964 when it was sold to Pearls Pty Ltd which operated GRAFTON until 1976 . It was then sold and registered to Dianna Hergatt in Cairns , Queensland . <p> GRAFTON 's history after this time is not well documented , but it is known to have been through a series of owners and was converted to a yacht with a large wheelhouse .

@@77262442 @5962442/ <h> The Couta Boat <p> The Victorian Couta boat is a distinct Australian designed working boat , with a long history that continues unbroken to the present day . The origins of this type , which worked the Bass Strait areas out of Port Phillip Bay and southern Victoria , go back to the latter part of the 1800s . <p> The name is derived from the fish barracouta ( Thyristies atun ) , a common fish found off the Victorian coastline and not to be confused with the fierce barracuda found in warmer waters . " Couta " as they are called colloquially , are up to 1.2 metres long , and are caught on hooked trolling lines . A strip of rawhide was used for bait . As an abundant and inexpensive fish it was used to supply the fish and chips trade in Melbourne . <p> Origins <p> Queenscliff , just inside Port Phillip Heads was a fishing community which initially worked their local areas inside the bay . To go out the heads required a boat capable of handling the " The Rip " as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offshore conditions . By the 1890s they had established a fleet that was working out into the strait , using sailing craft that were different from the inshore boats . When railways reached coastal communities the ability to transport fish quickly to Melbourne encouraged the fleet size to expand and made it practical to fish offshore and the freight the catch to the market . <p> These craft were designed and built locally , probably as a combined effort between the fishermen and boat builders in regards to their arrangement , proportions and structure . The requirements , based on the conditions , type of fishing and small number of crew quickly evolved into a vessel up to 26 foot long , 10 foot wide and over 3 feet of hull draft . It had a foredeck , side decks and small aft deck , enough to keep the boat dry in rough seas , but not too decked in to make it awkward to fish from . There was a steel plate centre board , a lug rigged mainsail and a jib . These simple boats were usually planked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and stringers . Just two crew members were needed to man the boats , with a set of oars to use when the wind dropped . <p> The straight stem and moderate sheer were typical for the period , but other features could well be the hallmarks that distinguish the craft and make it unique . The keel profile was straight or had just a small amount of rocker and the forefoot was deep enough to allow the boat to drift broadsides to the wind without falling away from the head . The hull had good carrying capacity , and was nicely balanced so that it would sail easily . <p> The Rig <p> The moderately proportioned lug rigged mainsail used a single halyard arranged as both a peak and hoist , so that one person could easily set or stow the sail , and there were no runners to complicate tacking or gybing . It could be set so that the boat would drift while lying ahull , beam on to the wind . When hauled in it was trimmed to sail at speed to and from the grounds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thwart , rowlock blocks and had rounded coamings in plan view . <p> Development of the type : <p> There does not seem to be any individual craft recorded that defined the characteristics , it was more likely to be a gradual process of small changes . Photographs of vessels in the late 1880s show a mixture of craft from 18 feet upwards , some clinker , with various amounts of decking and no centreboard . The move toward a more standard form probably happened over the decade or two leading to the 1890s . Change would come about as the fishermen developed their practices and the builders responded with features that worked and were retained in new boats while undesirable details were not repeated . Eventually the differences between boats became more subtle and started to reflect a builder 's particular preferences . <p> There is the possibility that the naval architect and boat builder Henry Murray introduced the centreboard in the early 1880s . He had come from England in the 1850s and built a large number of craft for Port Phillip Bay and nearby areas , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WANDERER from 1891 appears to have a centreboard and most of the typical characteristics of a Couta boat . This certainly shows that by that period the basic elements of the type had been formed . <p> Fleets and craft worked from communities on both sides of the heads and speed became an important factor as it would help to be first to the fishing grounds and then first home again to get the best position to unload the catch . The craft did race each other in special regattas or events from time to time , and bigger sails were used as this became a serious activity , but above all they were still working craft and the fishermen 's livelihood and safety depended upon a hull and rig appropriate to that job . <p> A significant change was when the gaff rigged mainsail was introduced after the 1900s . The better set of the mainsail compared to the overlapping lug rig would have improved the speed , and still been easy to handle . The peak could be set higher , the mainsail would set evenly on either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yard extending beyond the mast and bearing on the rigging were eliminated . Two or three jibs were carried for different wind strengths , and a smaller main may also have been carried on the lug rigged craft . Not everyone adopted the gaff rig , to some the tradition of the lug was strong and they were reluctant to change something that worked well enough for them . <p> The Introduction of the Engine <p> The next major change was the introduction of the engine . This became widespread after the First World War , and gradually many craft were adapted to be fitted with engines , but in the meantime the newer craft were given more volume aft and a properly fitted aperture for the propeller . As the reliability of the engine improved and became accepted , then the need for a good sailing rig became redundant , but a rig was still needed for drift fishing , so it was not abandoned totally , just reduced in size . The process of adaptation was slow , and again the reluctance to accept change meant that some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ World War . <p> Use <p> Fishing for barracouta was the primary task , but as the trade fluctuated the vessels were adapted to other tasks either temporarily or permanently . They were used for cray boats , and mullet or shark fishing . The railways that took the catch to Melbourne from the coast , brought visitors for day trips on the weekends , often in great numbers , and the craft took them out for a jaunt around the bay or just offshore of the major ports . Some craft became private yachts or launches and moved out of the commercial area entirely . The style of craft also spread to other parts of the coast and interstate , such as South Australia , but by then the proportions were well established . <p> . Builders <p> Later builders were Jones , Hanson , Blunt , Lacco and Locke , and there are close connections between some of them . JR Jones is credited with building boats of deeper draft , such as the THISTLE which is referred to as a ' wedgey " shape in cross section @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ craftsman , and one of his apprentices was Mitchie Lacco in the early 1900s . Lacco set up in Queenscliff , and was a fisherman and builder . He was also keen on racing and experimented a lot on his designs , and made a significant contribution to the development of the fastest sailing couta boats . Mitchie 's sons became involved as well , and the family moved to Rosebud and continued there . Meanwhile Peter Locke took over Lacco 's Queenscliff shed . Locke had been apprenticed to Lacco , and had then bought him out . <p> Post World War II <p> The peak of the sailing couta boat was around the 1920s . They were used right up until the 2nd World War , but post war the diesel engine became the standard method of propulsion , and the sailing rig was then more or less abandoned on any new fishing craft . The once large fleets no longer worked their favoured areas under sail , but a number of the craft remained extant in various forms of usage . <p> Their history was still alive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ builders . Inspired by this a number of the existing craft have been restored and new craft built very closely along the lines of their forebears . Tim Phillips from Sorrento is recognised as a leading influence on this resurrection and maintains a yard that has restored some craft and built new boats along the lines of the original boats . There is now a strong fleet of craft in Victoria and other states , which sail and race with the traditional gaff rigs , as they once did for a living .

The resulting explosion tore hull plates apart , and caused internal supporting structure to buckle . Incredibly , the cruiser 's bow remained in place , but just barely .

@@77262462 @5962462/ <h> Paddle Steamers of the Murray-Darling <p> A number of the existing historic Murray-Darling River system paddle steamers are listed on the Australian Register of Historic Vessels , each continuing their life on the river from past to the present . Digital Outreach Curator Penny Edwell has written the following story that traces the history of the paddle steamers in their heyday , with some of their fascinating stories . <p> The waters of the Murray-Darling trickle along some 13,000 kilometres of river , dispersing like veins over 400,000 square miles of Australian landscape . This substantial river system 's own long history speaks of rough geological fits and spurts , of a great continent turning slowly in its sleep and of the filtered snow of far distant mountain ranges . <p> Throughout the history of European settlement the Murray-Darling has been the subject of fierce debate over water usage and subsequent environmental damage . However life along its riverbanks , as Australia pivoted on Federation , created a unique waterside community whose legacy encompasses economic development and questions of national identity . <p> The Murray-Darling river system extends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ run across parts of New South Wales , Queensland , South Australia , Victoria and the Australian Capital Territory . This river system had sustained Indigenous communities for thousands of years before European explorers began investigating the waterways in the 1820s . <p> Industry soon followed , beginning in earnest with the first two paddle steamers to reach Swan Hill on the Murray River in 1853 " Francis Cadell 's Lady Augusta and William Randell 's Mary Ann . The two men were spurred by the desire to find an alternative to the slow-moving and expensive bullock teams who were previously relied upon to transport produce such as wool and wheat from the isolated stations that peppered the Murray-Darling Basin . <p> Cadell and Randell 's efforts proved that the rivers were navigable and it did not take long for a growing fleet of steamers to become the life-line of settlers along the Murray-River Basin . By 1890 there were at least 170 steamers in operation , working the 5,600 kilometres of the Murray-Darling that was navigable . The shallow-draught steamers and their barges transported produce to the sea and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Australia and Euchuca in Victoria , however they also returned with supplies for the settlers , bringing in tools , household goods , building materials and food . <p> A unique floating community developed along the rivers as the paddle steamers moved along the Murray-Darling 's waters . Residents eagerly awaited the arrival of the steamers , bringing news , household goods , medical supplies and staff to isolated homesteads and camps along the river banks . Steamers also carried tourists and often served as hotels moored alongside river towns too small to have their own . The paddle steamer Platypus , operating in the 1880s , included among its crew a team of women and their sewing machines who took orders at posts along the river before delivering the completed products on the return trip . The mission steamers Etona and Glad Tidings provided a mobile place of worship , bringing religion to remote regions unable to support a church . <p> Ship-building industries developed alongside agricultural industries in towns such as Goolwa , Mannum and Moama and mariners and maritime tradesmen came from afar to exploit the burgeoning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Murray-Darling 's waters , which held many dangers of its own including hidden banks , snags and temperamental water levels . Navigational charts were often inherited , copied or created from an intimate knowledge of the river 's features . Several of these long hand-drawn scrolls still survive and they are as individual as their creators - often carrying inky representations of long-lost homesteads , structures and even prominent trees . <p> Into this world of river trade , the Sydney Morning Herald sent novice journalist Charles Edwin Woodrow Bean , to provide regular reports on rural developments . Bean would go on to become one of Australia 's most significant historians and later in life admitted to being unenthusiastic about the assignment , however his indifference was not to last . Bean 's initial weekly reports were compiled and published under the title Along the Wool Track which inspired a second journey , undertaken on a paddle steamer along the Darling River . This assignment also generated a book , Dreadnought of the Darling , which was published in 1911 and playfully referenced , in its title , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Darling contained accounts of daily life on a cargo paddle steamer , historical and geological observations and " most significantly " warm recollections of the characters Bean encountered . When one looked again , she did remind one distantly of a warship of sorts ( p20 ) <p> Travelling on the steamer Janda ( always referred to in the book as the Dreadnought ' ) Bean wound his way into isolated pockets of the country where he met cameleers , boundary riders , station owners and shearers . He encountered Australians of all skills , backgrounds and vocations who were generating a living along the river and who , in his eyes , shared certain noble characteristics . The sum of his observations was that Britain 's colonial outpost was fast developing a nation of strong , resourceful and above all honourable people who exhibited a strong sense of loyalty Bean defined as mateship ' . In Bean 's eyes , the most important product of the rural industries along the river was not the material goods , but the men who were developing from its exertions . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ancient country , the old friend and protector of a younger land , finds herself in difficulties , there is a younger land , existing in quite unsuspected quarters the quality of sticking " whatever may come and whatever may be the end of it " to an old mate ' . p 312 <p> Several years after Dreadnought on the Darling was published , Bean found himself observing Australians in far different context . In 1914 he secured the job as Australia 's official war correspondent , a position won narrowly from Keith Murdoch . Soon after Bean was reporting from the trenches at Gallipoli where he witnessed what he had hoped to see " that those qualities he had observed in the people of the Australian bush were coming to the fore in the crucible of war . <p> The big thing in the war for Australia was the discovery of the character of Australian men . It was character which rushed the hills at Gallipoli and held on there . ( C.E.W.

This veneration gave rise to the notion of the Anzac Spirit ' and influenced much of Bean 's later work , including the extensive Official History of Australia in the War of 1914-1818 and his establishment of the Australian War Memorial . <p> Bean 's attempts to define an Australian character ' as he saw it emerge through the national experience of war had its basis in the rural communities along the Darling River . Bean , like Banjo Paterson before him , was inspired by the Australian bush in his search for a definable national identity - one that perhaps remains elusive , evolving and undefinable today . <p> The age of the paddle steamer on the Murray-Darling river system came to an end in the 1950s. many of the paddle steamers such as Lady Augusta to Etona and Bean 's Janda slowly disappeared from the water .

It was built in 1911 by Joseph Dent , at Huskisson NSW . LADY DENMAN is one of two surviving examples of a wooden double-ended Sydney harbour ferry . LADY DENMAN displays some of Reeks ' unorthodox design ideas , in particular the use of a single propeller on a double-ended hull form . It is also one of the two remaining ferries designed by Reeks from at least 20 different ferries of his design that were used in four states of Australia from 1892 through to the next century . <p> DescriptionThe ferry LADY DENMAN was launched late in 1911 at the builder 's yard of Joseph Dent on Currambene Creek at Huskisson , then towed up to Sydney carrying a load of timber ( acting as ballast as well as a commercial product ) where the fitout and engine installation were completed , possibly by Morrison and Sinclair .

The 38hp Chapman and Co. compound steam engine gave 10 knots of speed , and it featured the unique push or pull single propeller at one end of the double ended hull form , an arrangement favoured by the naval architect Walter Reeks on many of his later designs . <p> Walter Reeks first ferry for the company was THE LADY MARY in 1892 , followed by LADY MANNING in 1894 . Both ferries had unorthodox features and this became a trademark for the majority of Reeks ferry designs .

The five closely related ferries , LADY CHELMSFORD , LADY DENMAN , LADY SCOTT , LADY EDELINE and LADY FERGUSON were to remain in service for over 60 years , passing into the hands of Sydney Ferries as they amalgamated with or took over many of the smaller harbour services after WW1 . The LADY DENMAN was taken out of the fleet in 1979 . The last one to be retired was the LADY EDELINE in 1984 .

Restoration and rebuilding work continues to take place ensuring the vessel will remain in good condition for many years to come . In 2009 due to the probable loss of sistership LADY CHELMSFORD in Melbourne , LADY DENMAN has become the second last surviving wooden double-ended ferry remaining extant , the other one is sister ship LADY SCOTT which has operated as a charter vessel on Sydney Harbour , with a different superstructure .

@@77262483 @5962483/ <p> The Whitsunday Island Bark Canoe is an Aboriginal bark canoe built around 1900 . It is from the Australian Musuem collectionand is a rare example of this type of indigenous water craft . It is one of the few examples held in a collection and shows the three-panel construction of the type , which was only used in a small area of the Queensland Coast adjacent to the Whitsunday Island region and is not recorded anywhere else . <p> DescriptionThis Indigenous three-piece bark canoe is made in 3 panels with a bottom and two sides . The panels of bark are flat , and stitched to each other . The top edge of the side panels has a branch of timber lashed to the edge , and the joint between the panels also has a branch on the inside , held together with lashing or stitching . These branches stiffen the structure , and the joints between the three panels are caulked to make them watertight . There is one internal frame at the middle of the hull , and it is also made from a branch . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end , and in profile the bottom panel curves upwards and the top edge curves downwards toward both ends . There is an interesting repair to a small split in one side panel , where it is pulled together with fibre lashing that is bound around a small reinforcing stick on the inside surface . It also appears to have had the inside surfaces treated with fire to remove loose material . There are no records showing when this craft was built , but it was collected around 1900 and so is assumed to come from that time as well . <p> The type was used in open waters between the islands in the Whitsunday Island Group off the northern Queensland coast . This use in potentially choppy water is helped by the relatively high freeboard of the side panels when compared with other Indigenous bark canoes . As well as being used for fishing activities , the craft enabled the Indigenous people to maintain inter-island contact . 73935 @qwx693935

@@77262487 @5962487/ <p> MV TACOMA is a wooden fishing vessel built in Port Fairy Victoria in the late 1940s . TACOMA was the vessel which established the tuna fishing industry in Southern Australian waters , based in Port Lincoln in South Australia . This has led directly to Port Lincoln becoming one of the largest and economically most important fishing ports in Australia.It is an example of successfully adapting an American design to Australian conditions , and has a very strong connection to the region it operated in and the communities it was associated with . <p> DescriptionTACOMA was built by the Haldane brothers William , Alan and Hugh from 1944 to 1951 at Port Fairy , Victoria . The 25.6 metre long hull is wooden carvel construction , planked in oregon on the topsides and jarrah underwater . The stem is a piece of rolled steel plate , and the transom is made up of a series of stepped almost square sectioned planks . Both items are examples of TACOMA 's sturdy construction and the Haldanes ability to build things to suit their requirements and resources . The boat was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ replaced with a 500hp Grenaa diesel in 1971 . TACOMA is a tuna clipper and one of the few early examples of this type still surviving in Australia . <p> The Haldane brothers ' background included couta and shark fishing out of Port Fairy . They were also aware of the large schools of salmon and tuna in deeper waters , but realized they needed a much larger and more versatile boat to establish themselves in this new venture . They considered the American tuna clipper to be the ideal craft . Through contact with people in the USA who fished for tuna on the Pacific coast they formed a close association with Jim Petrich in Washington , who had prepared designs for these vessels . <p> Building TACOMA was a massive undertaking for the three brothers and their families . A shed was made on the Moyne River bank at Port Fairy , logs were felled and brought in , and largely by their own hands the hull took shape . Ingenuity and perseverance overcame any physical obstacles , but eventually they realized that they would need financial assistance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of loans from the South Australia , but under the understanding that it would operate from a South Australian port and would be used ' to develop the fishing industry generally , particularly purse seining ' . <p> Consequently after its launch in 1951 TACOMA 's maiden voyage was from Port Fairy to Port Lincoln in South Australia , via Adelaide . On board for the exodus to the west were the three Haldane brothers and their entire families , plus the Bellamy twins who had helped with the construction , and the cook ; in all a total of nine adults , ten children , one watchdog and two cats . By the time they arrived in Port Lincoln there were six more aboard , the kittens born during the passage . <p> TACOMA began its fishing life in 1952 as a purse seiner , fishing for Southern Bluefin Tuna and other pelagic fish in the Great Australian Bight . By the end of the 1954 season this had proven a failure and they changed over to tuna pole fishing with assistance from the American Jangaard brothers who came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sponsored by the South Australian Government . <p> After trials on board TACOMA , with a crew which included Tom Playford , the South Australian Premier as one of the tuna polers the change of method was proved a success with significant catches taken . Onshore the cannery was now able to process the haul , marking the beginning of a viable industry . The TACOMA and other vessels which joined to establish a fleet also used a light aircraft as spotter planes to locate schools of tuna . A seasonal pattern became established and through into the 1960s they worked the East Coast Tuna fishery from Eden to Sydney from September to December and the Great Australian Bight from Jan to May . <p> A large vessel was needed to cope with the rugged sea conditions including the need to go out to the edge of the continental shelf at times , and the ability to stay out from port for a long period before landing the catch . TACOMA worked the two tuna seasons with individual fishing trips lasting up to 2 weeks at a time with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Bellamy twins . <p> A downturn in the tuna industry occurred in the late 1960s . The Haldanes then decided to change over to the new prawn industry and a refitted TACOMA then became a success as a prawn trawler . Throughout its long life TACOMA was refitted three times including the addition of refrigeration , double rigged booms for prawn trawling , a new engine , and in 1975 it was the first vessel in South Australia to undertake on board processing . In 2003 the vessel was finally retired from service , having been operated by two generations of the Haldane family over 50 years of continuous service . <p> The Haldanes had done their homework well when they chose the design for TACOMA , and remained lifelong friends with the Petrichs in the USA . The name TACOMA comes from the city in Washington State USA where the Petrich 's firm Western Boatbuilding made tuna clippers . They were surprised when the Haldanes requested plans for a clipper and had sent a cheque in payment for the advertised drawings . In fact Western Boatbuilding had not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a set to sell when the order came . They had to make up a set from their full sized loftings for their own craft . The builders were so pleased that the Haldanes were interested in their design that they returned the cheque and the brothers got the plans for free .

@@77262488 @5962488/ <h> 12-Foot Skiff Class <p> The colorful and dynamic progression of skiffs that passes by on summer weekends as a fleet of the 12-Foot Skiff class has been a fertile ground of innovation , training , highly skilled sailing and unequalled performance for almost a century in Australia and New Zealand . Since 1958 it has also been another arena for the long-standing cross-Tasman sporting rivalry between the two countries , with crew 's racing for the Interdominion Trophy . The 12-foot skiff with its unrestricted sail area and vibrant history captures almost all the features of the iconic Sydney Harbour 18-foot Skiff Class , but tries to fit them into a boat only 12 feet ( 3.65 metres ) long , resulting in a boat that is a floating , high-speed pressure cooker , frequently reaching boiling point , and often blowing the lid on the narrow confines of the Parramatta or Lane Cove Rivers , or creating mayhem out on the open harbour . The 12-foot skiffs have raced in Sydney NSW , the Brisbane River and Moreton Bay in Qld or out on the mighty Waitamata @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ larger 18-foot skiff is a world recognised feature of Australian yachting and sporting culture , the 12-footers have done the same at a regional level , initially in Sydney and Brisbane in the 1920s , before linking up with similar craft in New Zealand in the late 1950s . The vibrant class captures the same 18-foot skiff vision of exciting sailing , while it is probably the boat as much as the people associated with it that captures the larrikin side of the Australian character . The 12-footers have been both a training class for bigger skiffs , an exciting example of highly skilled sailing , and a reflection of the changes in technology , all factors that have all kept the class sailing for over century . <p> The appeal of the 12-foot skiff was captured early on by JF Black , writing in the Australian Aquatic Annual 1938 . <p> " When it is realised that these small boats , 12 feet in length , with a maximum of 5 feet beam , have no lee cloths or hoods , and carry the gear they do , one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so well and perform the remarkable feats that they do , keeping their boats going under all weather conditions . It is not unusual for a 12-footer , off a breeze , to have 600 square feet of sail . When you realise that this means carrying a mast of from 21 feet to 22 feet , a gaff of 17 feet to 18 feet , with peak-head extras off the gaff , it is not hard to understand the enthusiasm that the followers of this class feel , and the skill of skippers and crews in getting results . " <p> The 12-foot skiffs probably began as a formal class around 1914 . In many respects they are a smaller version of their bigger relations the 18-foot skiffs . As with the 18-footers , these were often boats for the working class and tradesmen families of the foreshores , but with clubs being established in the North Shore and eastern suburbs of Sydney , it captured a broader cross-section of Sydney society . It was often a boat for youths at apprentice age or younger perhaps . For them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come , and for many this was their introduction to the type of boats being sailed by their fathers . Others stayed loyal to the 12-footer ; they had found their challenge and did not need to move on to another class . The skiffs were well adapted to both streams , simple but robust craft with an unrestricted and therefore out of proportion sail area , crewed by sailors already bonded by their family and neighborhood background and looking to follow the family 's well worn boating path . Over-rigged , sailed on the edge with fierce rivalry , the skiffs were their weekly adventure to look forward too . <p> EARLY AUSTRALIAN HISTORY <p> The Cremorne Sailing Club in 1914 is recognized as the first club to promote 12-foot skiff racing , and three of the Muston family , a well known sailing name on the harbour at the time , owned skiffs withy that club . It only lasted a short period and is understood to have ceased around 1917 . The Lane Cove Club ( originally founded in 1896 ) and reformed around 1916 then took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Foot Sailing Club it has been a mainstay for 12-foot skiffs ever since . In 1924 the Greenwich Flying Squadron was formed nearby at Greenwich , and in 1926 another club was formed at Vaucluse. 1924 was also the year the class adopted an unrestricted sail area , up to this point they had a comparatively small sail plan , but with the abolition of that rule the boats quickly began to develop exceptionally large sail areas . They were planked as seam-batten carvel hulls in Queensland cedar , and sailed by four crew , with gaff mains , ringtails and enormous spinnakers . The rig dwarfed the tiny hull , and nothing has changed with that concept over the decades . <p> By the mid 1920s the NSW skiffs were competing between clubs for a state pennant awarded to the boat with the best record over three races . However 1926 marked a major milestone in the class development when the first Australian Championship was held . Ben Roff from the Greenwich Flying Squadron decided to take his club champion 12-footer SCHEMER to Brisbane to race with two 12s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Brisbane River . In Queensland J Gould built VICTORY while the legendary Brisbane shipwright Alf Whereat took two feet from the stern of a 14 foot skiff he was building and finished it off as a 12-footer called DEFIANCE , and promptly won this inaugural event . Queensland then established club racing for the skiffs and very quickly built a solid foundation of crews and boats to match the NSW clubs . <p> With both states having strong fleets the Australian Championship became a regular event , closely fought and honours were evenly shared . Ben Roff in SCHEMER eventually won four events , but Queenslanders Jack McCleer in DOVE I and J Crouch in C.C.II also took the honours as the event location alternated between the states . Both states had also formed 12 Foot Skiff Councils to oversee the individual clubs racing 12-footers , and in NSW the first president was well known champion sailor and designer James Alderton . Alderton had been a founding member of the 21-Foot Restricted Class of yachts , by this time the premier national yacht racing class , and subsequently designed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the primary national training dinghy , so he was an excellent person to guide the new council through its early years . Meanwhile another towering figure in Australian and Queensland yachting and commerce , the ' pearl king ' James Clark ( d. 1933 ) had awarded the James Clark Memorial Cup to be raced for in conjunction with the Australian Championships . <p> Numbers were impressive , the Australian Aquatic Annual in 1937 lists six NSW clubs sailing 12 foot skiffs , with a combined total of over 80 craft registered amongst them . One was skippered by a lady Miss Kath Farr , and in 1936 she won the James Clark Memorial Trophy in AUSSIE , representing the Vaucluse Club . <p> The skiffs continued in both states after the war , and development centered on the potential for a narrower hull form , three handed skiff . Success came in the early 1950s with ESTRALLITA from Queensland , skippered by sailmaker ' Chic ' Ware and designed and built by Don Piper . Having established the potential other similar designs followed and as the decade moved ahead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change in direction for the class at this time came toward the end of the 1950s with the introduction of an Interdominion Championship , initially raced for by a combination of 12-foot dinghy and skiff classes from Australia and New Zealand . <p> THE INTERDOMINION CHAMPIONSHIP <p> In New Zealand an unrestricted style of 12 footer began in 1951 with boatbuilder Dave Marks at the Glendowie Boating Club in Auckland . He demonstrated the value of increasing the sail area on the 12 foot long Pennant Class and this led to the Q Class of unrestricted 12-footers . A Q Class Owner 's Association was formed in 1955-56 with racing at the Tamaki Yacht Club <p> The idea of a cross-Tasman contest began soon after when New Zealand 18-foot skiff crews who also sailed in the various 12-foot classes in New Zealand came to in Australia for the 18-footer championships . In discussion with their Australian colleagues they all noted that 12-footers were being raced in various forms on both sides of the Tasman . An Interdominion series was suggested , open to all classes of 12 foot long skiff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in January 1957 on Sydney Harbour . <p> The New Zealand visitors were led by Don Brooke , owner of the Q class NIMBLE . The fleet included three Q class from New Zealand , six 12-foot skiffs from NSW and one from Queensland , four Victorian Gwen 12s , five NSW Gwen 12s , one Gwen 12 from South Australia and two Port Phillip 12s . The Interdominion series was also held in conjunction with the Australian Championships , which was still considered the primary event for the Australian 12-footers at that time . The event comprised four heats and included a ruling that any capsize meant instant disqualification ; in fact if any of the Australian 12s capsized they became swamped and could not be righted again . The Silasec Trophy for the winner was donated by Mr. Keith Golding of Sealwall Trading Company , who had an association with the Abbotsford Club , and the winner was NSW Gwen 12 FARWAC sailed Frank Rance and Bill Cavey . Gwen 's had always been sailed by two crew , one on trapeze , and the 12-footers were now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the trapeze . <p> At a 1957 meeting it was decided that six boats would represent each dominion , the 2nd edition of the Interdominion constitution was reviewed by the Australian clubs , and a note was inserted indicating " that the NSW Association pay for the repair of the beds at the NZ team accommodation " . The larrikin side of the sport was very much alive . <p> Innovation was the next highlight , but the actual novel idea was soon banished . The second series in 1959 was held in Auckland New Zealand , and only two Australian boats went across , the remainder of the Australian fleet went to Brisbane for the Australian Championships as they considered it more important . Meanwhile the resounding winner of the Interdominion series was a NZ catamaran called KITTY , 12 feet long and skippered by John Peet , which had joined the Q class in 1958 . Fortunately the catamarans broke away and formed their own class known as ' Kittycats ' , but a legacy of that incident is a clause in the hull definition that effectively rules @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sydney in early January 1961 over 5 heats . This event established two precedents - a new venue of Clifton Gardens on Sydney Harbour ( including the temporary erecting of a marquee to house the boats ) and the Australian championships were no longer part of the event . The series also included two Gwen 12s , two Port Phillip 12s , and six Cherubs from New Zealand alongside the New Zealand Q class and Australian 12-foot skiffs . The NSW team was chosen by selection based on race results , but NZ dominated the sailing with FLAMINGO skippered by John Chapple winning 3 of the 4 heats . The best Australian boat was ' VALHALLA skippered by Alan Ridley from Greenwich which placed 9th . <p> For the 1963 event in Auckland , the NSW Association made preparations to ensure a larger , quality team was sent and even commissioned a blazer as part of a uniform .

The NZ team won the inaugural Don Brooke Trophy for the best overall team results , and the NZ Trade Commissioner attended the presentation night , a reflection on the importance attached to the series . New Zealand continued through the decade with wins to Don Lidgard , then Russell Bowler in JENNIFER JULIAN , the first of the foam sandwich hulls , and Bruce Farr . sailing BEAZLEY HOMES , a sign of the times as sponsorship began to be involved . Farr and Bowler were later to become the driving force behind Bruce Farr yacht designs , one of the top international firms from the 1980s onwards , and Lidgard and his crew Tony Bouzaid have been at the top of the sail making industry in NZ . The only Australian to win was Dave Porter in AUSSIE in 1966 and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ domination over the 70s and 80s . Long time 12-footer skipper Michael Chapman won in 1972 with POL , and introduced downwind gybing angles to the class . The stitch-and-glue plywood hulls and then the bigger safety-first boats pushed the performance ahead . Some sailors were now helped by sponsorship which covered some of the costs , but it was still very much an amateur , self-funded sport for most sailors . Teenager Iain Murray , later to dominate 18-foot skiffs with seven successive world titles , moved into 12s from the Cherub Class . With a big , relatively safe hull of his own design called SUNSET MOTELS he won the 1975 series . Michael Coxon then won successive trophies in 1976 and 1977 , a feat repeated by Larry Cargill and then Alan Broadbent in the 1980s . <p> Throughout this period the New Zealanders kept sailing , but reached a critical low point in 1983 when they could only afford to enter one crew , who sailed a borrowed NSW boat in a series sailed from the Vaucluse Club . Their fortunes were reversed soon after in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ six Interdominion titles in his Australian designed hull called DIMENSION SAILCLOTH , the only NZ winner from 1969 to 1991 . Other hulls were built and the class expanded again . The 1992 Interdominions went to the NZ team in BAYFERROX , and then Australia won it back with GUS &amp; DICKS EXCELLENT ADVENTURE . <p> From 1993/94 through to 2001/2002 New Zealand was on top , including four successive wins to Tim Bartlett in DIMENSION POLYANT SAILCLOTH , a feat that has never been repeated . After that the title has changed between the two countries every year or so and in 2003 Queensland scored its first win when Paul O'Malley Jones won in EAST COAST PILE &amp; DRILLING . In 2011 the current holder after an exciting series on Sydney 's Parramatta River hosted by the Lane Cove club is DIMENSION POLYANT SAILCLOTH , but this is now an Australian boat sailed by Nic Press . It has successfully defended its championship win from 2010 in Auckland . The 52nd series will be sailed in Auckland in January 2012 . <p> Over the years the Interdominions have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brisbane , at Saratoga north of Sydney , in Auckland and Wellington NZ , and down at Geelong in Victoria . It has been the premier event on the 12-footer calendar for decades and is often closely followed by the yachting media . <p> However it was not the only series In Australia or New Zealand . NSW and Queensland sailed their own state championship series , and then joined together for an Australian title , often sailed during Easter over four heats . Individual club Invitation races were also held throughout the season . Around Sydney this created a challenge for some as they tackled the difficult , narrow courses at Abbotsford and Lane Cove . It was always a relief to spend the weekend in November at Saratoga for their Invitation races on Brisbane Waters at the Central Coast - open water without ferries , headlands , rocks or Searle 's Monument to get wrapped around . In New Zealand they also sailed their own local titles and special events , and for reasons best known to them they even sailed occasionally on the lake or duck pond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Wherever they sail 12-foot skiffs grab people 's attention ; somewhere under that huge rig is a boat , with crew on trapeze , the whole thing looks balanced yet it is being constantly trimmed by the crew and sailing way faster than anything else around its size . The attraction and challenge of the 12-foot skiff should ensure its longevity for many more seasons . <p> DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION <p> The class has always been at the forefront of lightweight construction relative to the era , but the contrast between the first cedar hulls and the 2011 composite hulls is huge . <p> The early hulls were cedar planked , seam-batten carvel construction , supported by closely spaced hardwood frames , a hard wood keel and stem , stringers or risers for the thwarts , solid timber masts , and steel plate centreboards- all typical for the era of open boats , craft that swamped when you capsized . It is the opposite of the 2011 monocoque composite paneled hulls . These have minimal internal framework , they are allowed buoyancy tanks and a foredeck , they have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be righted and then sail on with a chance to win . The modern 12 still shares the concept of carrying as much sail as possible , but has evolved to reflect the technology of the times . <p> The evolution has largely been a story of finding ways to make a faster boat , usually looking to make it lighter and narrower , or improving the rig . This has been achieved through occasional significant changes followed by periods of incremental improvements . Among the constants has been the option of different rigs to suit the weather , changing from the original solution of just having a smaller suit of sails to the multiple three and sometimes four complete sets of masts and sails , with the rig chosen at the last minute based on the expected pattern for the race . <p> The first cedar planked hulls were relatively buoyant , with plenty of volume forward of the mast . Some sported a snub bow , popular on the 14-foot skiffs and seen briefly on three 18-foot skiffs , but otherwise the conventional sharp stem was used with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four crew members , and a big sailplan ready to drive the nose under if things got out of control . They were built over moulds , probably based on carved half models , but the legendary Queensland builder Alf Whereat conjured up his first 12 by cutting two feet off the stern of a fourteen footer he was building . <p> The boom and bowsprit extended the length of the vessel to over twice its 12 foot long hull . The rig was a gaff , soon peaked up so high that it was a gunter style , with no topsail . This was the status quo up to the Second World War , hull and sail shapes were refined , rigs tweaked and sail areas crept up as they pushed the limits of what might be possible . Spinnakers were set on poles made up in two sections . <p> After the war the first significant change occurred with the introduction of a narrower hull and a three person crew . Queensland boat ESTRALLITA was the first of this type to be successful ; it was designed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Ware to win the 1951 and 1953 Australian Championships . Another person who thought the idea might work was naval architect Alan Payne . In the late 1940s he drew a narrow , smaller hull design for long time 12-foot skiff skipper Malcolm Anderson . The first of these designs was not built , but later BROLGA 's designed by Payne for Anderson followed this path that was now the preferred concept for the 1950s boats . <p> The 1960s boats sported Marconi or Bermudan rigs , the gaff disappearing in the 1950s . They introduced the crew on trapeze , and crew numbers were down to two by the end of the decade . Lightweight plywood construction was adopted , either as moulded hulls or plywood chine shapes . Centreboards were wooden , sailcloth was nylon or Dacron , and with reduced spring or curvature to the hull bottom profile they planed across the water , inspired by the Cherub and Gwen 12 designs that were now popular and rival 12 foot long classes . In Australia Dennis Dignam , a forward hand and builder brought out a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early 70s as the dominant style . Russell Bowler with JENNIFER JULIAN introduced a foam and fibreglass construction hull , with a clean looking interior . It was ahead of its time , and the method was not widely adopted until the mid 1970s . Meanwhile the Farr designs from New Zealand introduced the U-sectioned hull shape . <p> Early in the 1970s Phil Stevenson brought the tortured stitch-and-glue plywood method with the seams stitched together before being taped and sealed with fibreglass . He produced a veed narrow shape and once again , a smaller hull . WALPURGIS WRATH showed enough potential for the Kulmar Bros to build their own version VAGABOND , another Interdominion winner . <p> Iain Murray introduced the next big change in direction in the mid 1970s , a reverse in the trend to small and narrow . Murray built a higher freeboard , bigger volume hull that could carry a powerful rig , bigger crew and was safer to push hard downwind . His first boat SUNSET MOTELS won the Interdominions , and later hulls for PHILLIPS , ADVANX RUBBER and INTERNATIONAL PAINTS refined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bows . Michael Coxon developed U sectioned double chine shapes starting with CONTRACT ENGINEERING that had fuller bows and narrower sterns to reduce the nose-diving dramas , while other designers such as Bill Bollard and sailmaker Bruce Hewish with FRESHWATER SAILS developed their own versions along the same themes . The final stage in this avenue was David Payne 's SOS MARINE hull for the Walsh Bros at Vaucluse . With fair lines , little hollow or concavity at the bow , no concave flare , parallel bottom sections aft and a more even shape all round it was a balance between speed and safety . Tim Bartlett in New Zealand recognised it as the fastest hull of the 1984 season , and built a balsa and fibreglass version DIMENSION SAILCLOTH that won the Interdominions in 1985 . Sister hulls were built and began a revival of the class in Auckland . <p> 1985/86 brought the next big step , and once again it was a narrower hull shape . NS 14 designer Michael Nash pulled the waterline in and drew semi-circular hull bottom panels with his AERO design , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was clearly the fastest shape . He produced variations to suit different crew weights , and his designs dominated the titles well into the 90s . By the end of the 1980s the fixed spinnaker pole on the centreline had replaced the two and three-section mast mounted poles that had survived decades as the means of setting huge spinnakers . The high aspect ratio rigs developed in the 1960s and 70s had big mainsail roaches , lots of mast bend and generous rake aft . The combination , aided by the ability of the fixed pole to lift the bow rather than drive it under , pushed the craft to a new level of performance , it was all becoming a little easier to handle and generally less dangerous downwind , so crews just pushed them harder . <p> The introduction of carbon fibre spars as the standard material reduced rig weights and therefore improved stability , but this was then interpreted as a means of reducing hull width again .

Many regional boats were made of plywood , but they were also from Masonite , corrugated iron and light-gauge sheet metal . CONRAE II is a fine example of resourcefulness and ingenuity ; it was constructed from solid timber book shelves removed from the Condon home at 62 Thompson Street in Wagga Wagga . CONRAE II is typical of the well-built , sturdy flat bottom boats which were common along the Murrumbidgee River system , and were particularly favoured by farmers whose properties had river frontage .

In the late 1940s there had been a short history of people adapting the aluminum drop tanks used on World War II military aircraft as boats , by simply cutting the streamlined tanks in half . However the aircraft grade aluminum quickly corroded in sea water , so there was natural distrust of the material for boats . Whilst one of Quantrill 's first hurdles was proving that better , marine grade aluminum was suitable for a long lasting craft , the other was working out how best to weld the material , a logical method of construction but not then suited to a tradesman 's regular application . <p> His first method used oxy acetylene which was slow , very tricky and needed significant skill . He then experimented with argon arc welding using high frequency welding machines and T.I.G. welding torches , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trade , and creating a viable production process . <p> There are other examples of small aluminum boats elsewhere around the world ; one is the punt shaped John Boat from the USA , a derivative of their wooden duck punts and sneak boxes . It is also possible that other enterprising individuals built their own craft , perhaps similar to Quantrill 's concept . However , as a recognized type built in large numbers , the vee-bottom planing tinnie is clearly a craft that was developed in Australia beginning with Quantrill 's work . <p> In 1951 a big step forward occurred when Quantrill 's friend , boat retailer Ted Hunt , offered the boats for sale through Hunt 's Marine in the south of Sydney . They were 10 , 12 and 14 foot long hulls , made from the saltwater-resistant aluminum alloy L-33 supplied by Comalco . From the beginning the lightweight , car-toppable and low maintenance aspects were promoted , and to offset the mistaken belief that a metal hull could not float , Quantrill pioneered the use of foam blocks under the thwarts as buoyant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it would not sink . <p> Demand steadily increased and by the early 1950s Quantrill 's backyard operation had moved to factory production in Presidents Avenue in Kogarah , then over to Taren Point . The massive floods in northern NSW during 1954 had created a shortage in the supply of small boats . Graziers had bought almost every available boat to use on their flooded stations to feed stock stranded on higher ground , and the tinnie was the ideal craft . It was robust , could be knocked about without compromising its operation , required little maintenance and was easy to transport , almost tailor made for a non-boating user to adapt to quickly . It was also possible to transport in bulk easily , stacked together on trains or trucks for shipping in larger numbers to regional areas and interstate . <p> A 1955 Seacraft advertisement by Quantrill and Arnold shows off the advantages of light weight , buoyancy and durability , but quite revealing are some of the dealers mentioned .

Boating was no longer a coastal market ; the inland waterways were part of the scene as well . <p> The next big boost came as the market expanded dramatically when large , factory mass production became viable . Early in the 1960s outboard motors became much more readily available when the import restrictions were removed , allowing the popular outboards from the Johnson , Evinrude and Mercury factories in the USA into the Australian market . At the same time the aircraft manufacturers De Havilland were encouraged to enter the market as boat builders . They were well set up to take on the task as they had tradesman familiar with aluminum construction . De Havilland boats , built in the industrial area of Bankstown NSW and promoted as Topper Aluminum Boats were initially built with riveted construction , a reflection of the company 's aircraft background , and over the decade they built craft by the thousands . <p> Other manufacturers joined the market as it continued to expand and confirm itself as a significant industry which remains strong in 2014 .

This had become established as a national class during 1921 and showed its potential early 1922 with the first interstate series for The Forster Cup . The winner of this series was James Alderton 's 21 called GUMLEAF , a yacht he had designed himself . Along with other prominent sailors Alderton had supported the class because it was recognized that there was a need to encourage yachting with new ideas , to bring newcomers into the sport and give broad racing experience to everyone . <p> The 21 's became a success in a short period , but Alderton still felt that the same approach should be applied to encourage youth sailing . He had in mind juniors , including the sons and relations of club members and felt that dingy sailing was the best option , because the 21 's were only suited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plans for a 12 foot long , lug-rigged , clinker dinghy for three crew , inspired by the European International 14 foot class .

In August 1922 eight club members agreed to support the class , and in October an order for eight of the dinghies was placed with the boatbuilding firm Stewart Sandeman at Careening Cove Sydney , while the club moved to create an Associate Membership category for 10 to 19 year old boys . <p> Australian Coal , Shipping , Steel and the Harbour , September 1 1922 carried an initial report of this in their regular Yachting Notes pages . <p> DINGHY SCHEME . A scheme of considerable importance to yachtsmen was expounded by Mr. Jas . Alderton , owner of the Australian Champion Gumleaf , at the prize-giving dinner of the Royal Prince Alfred Yacht Club . For some time he has been thinking over the advantages of an inexpensive dingy for class racing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the water , thus assuring the supply of recruits to the ranks of yachtsmen . He went thoroughly into the scheme , even getting out a design . To members of the R.P.A.Y.C. Mr. Alderton said What have the clubs done towards getting the youngsters interested in the sport ? " There was no answer . The scheme is for each yacht club to adopt the design and help the juniors to get the dinghies , or get them and allot them to sons of members , or members nominees . The design got out by Mr. Alderton shows that the dinghies will be 12 ft long , 5 ft beam and have a sail area of 100 sq feet . In order that every one who may sail in them shall have an equal chance , he suggests that the dinghies shall be of one-design and sail plan , and shall be identical in every way . The scheme was received with enthusiasm by the members , and soon eight boats had been promised towards the class .

They took to the idea immediately and created a small fleet , then hosted the first Interstate Cup on the Derwent River in March 1924 . It ended in a tie between representatives from both states . <p> During 1924 naval architect AC Barber was commissioned to modify the design with a few small changes and to prepare a full set of plans to be made available for professional and amateur builders .

Lord Stonehaven was driven by similar ideals in his desire to promote yachting amongst juniors throughout the nation . For a number of seasons both classes and their national trophies were raced for in the same state at a similar time . Lady Stonehaven also donated a series of cups for state competition to encourage the class within the states ; they were each called the Lady Stonehaven Cup . <p> Over the winter of 1927 Victoria established a fleet at Royal Brighton Yacht Club . They had three Cadets built for them in Hobart , and over the years this club became one of the stalwart class supporters . <p> Royal Queensland Yacht Squadron followed in 1928 , and when Royal Perth Yacht Club took on Cadets in 1930 finally all states had a fleet .

The situation remains the same in 2007 , with the Stonehaven Cup becoming a competition between crews from those three states .

In Northern NSW the river system was the best means of transport . <p> In January 1911 HEBE went to the rescue of the Harwood vehicular ferry , in difficulty in unusual circumstances , as reported in the Clarence and Richmond Examiner 17 January 1911 . Tons of water hyacinths had been washed down the Clarence River after heavy rainfall , and to relieve the weight of the vegetation against the punt , one of the wires was cut and the punt floated free into midstream .

For generations sailors from many seafaring locations had kept largely to the coast and if they were out of sight of land it was only for a short period . From the 15th century onwards locating a ship 's longitude at sea became a significant issue for the largely European sailors making passages on trade routes to and from domains still relatively new to them . They had begun to traverse the major oceans using routes that ventured well out of sight of land and familiar landmarks. - They had charts , but locating accurately where they were on the chart when there was no land in sight to relate to presented a problem . <p> All cultures had their ways of observing the sun , moon and stars and using them in their daily life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the location north or south of the equator. - But how far the ship had travelled along a line of latitude was a matter of dead reckoning ' , an estimation made from some poor and often unreliable sources of information , and the concern was heightened by the obvious danger of grounding on known but distant continental or island shores , and other hazards that were not even on the chart , and all of this maybe just beyond the horizon . <p> All cultures had their ways of observing the sun , moon and stars and using them in their daily life . Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders also used the sun and moon and read the night sky for direction , and it was knowledge passed on over countless generations , and in addition , helped with their understanding of the changes in seasons . The sky was a calendar as well , marking times progress over each year . <p> Kulba Yadail ( Old Lyrics ) ' .

ANMM Collection 00049227 . <p> Photograph : Andrew Frolows/ANMM . Estate of the late Billy Missi/Licensed by Viscopy , 2016 . <p> Let 's not forget some of the other passage makers in open waters . It 's interesting to reflect on the Polynesian navigators who did not have a distinct method of working out longitude either . They worked out their position in a different way , rather than seeking a grid of perpendicular lines . They understood latitude from the stars in the sky , which to them was a chart on display every night . By putting themselves directly under a star and heading with the wind along that 's stars line they could keep to a known latitude . They also used estimations of speed to figure out how far they may have travelled , but in addition they had accumulated generations of knowledge from observation of the wind , waves , currents and the environment to pick up signs of land well in advance of it appearing . They were less concerned about always knowing an exact point in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even though it was not visible . The knowledge was passed on , and with confidence they sailed their own highways between islands , navigating from the deck with their chart in the sky surrounding them , and the key to unlocking it in their head . <p> The sailors of the early modern period did not possess these observations and abilities to the same degree or with the same confidence , especially in unfamiliar territory . The Renaissance brought mankind many steps forward in technology- and sailors - were becoming more reliant on man-made instruments linked to tables of calculations , along with charts divided by - grid lines and points marked by intersections , and their approach to the longitude problem was to seek a solution that- was increasingly - worked out below decks with pen and paper . <p> The 1848 edition of ' A Complete Epitome of Practical Navigation ' by John William . <p> ANMM Collection : 00027116 . <p> A number of proposals were put forward to locate longitude , and the clearly mad ones such as lightships - anchored at close intervals across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were easily dismissed . - It was possible in theory and in practice on land to estimate longitude using tedious and complicated calculations from celestial observations of Jupiter 's moons , but this was not practical at sea . Other celestial based solutions were considered , but these could all come up with potentially unreliable results even assuming no mathematical mistakes were made . A favourite method in many quarters was Lunar Distance , relying on observations of earth 's moon , and it was necessary to know time for this method too . Work is the thief of time says the proverb , and much time was stolen by the decades of work it took to understand the moon 's pattern of movement to a point that the predictions could be considered even reasonably reliable . As well , until the octant and sextant were refined further , it was impractical aboard ships to accurately measure the angles needed for the calculation . <p> In parallel with this determination to use the stars or the moon , the solution through the difference in time was well enough known . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and periodically came to the surface again and again . - The easier part was telling the time where you were even without a timepiece . This - could be done with existing technology - by observing the sun and noting when it was ever so briefly at its highest point in the sky through a series of observations either side of midday gave you midday at your location with quite reasonable accuracy . The problem was the second element needed , carrying the time of day from another location with you . What was needed was a timepiece that remained accurate to the second for a very long period- many months was desirable , but a couple of years was the ultimate goal . <p> Named because its arc is equal to one sixth of a circle , a sextant is actually capable of measuring angles up to 120 degrees . It was this feature which made them particularly useful when attempting to determine longitude using the lunar distance method . <p> ANMM Collection : 00006711 . <p> The solution came in a series of timepieces designed and built @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the exhibition . He had to overcome a wide range of practical problems due to materials , the mechanical actions of the machinery , the marine environment , and the outside influence of the ship 's rapid and seemingly random movements- all aimed at a timepiece that maintained a regular , even beat for each second . His focus on the problems that temperature changes caused to crucial metal parts was just one area where his solutions gave big improvements to the accuracy of timepieces . <p> Meanwhile , as he perfected his clock making approach both the tables and instruments needed for Lunar Distance were coming together in a usable manner as well , and the competition between the two was exacerbated by the 1714 Longitude Act that had offered a substantial reward for an acceptable solution . Along with the fortune waiting to be claimed were the inevitable politics , personalities and pride as people fought to be the one who got the reward . All these elements served to make the route to the final solution contorted , poisoned and frustrating for all involved . <p> In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decades . The first three of his timepieces were bulky and the two that were completed came closer to the accuracy wanted than had been achieved before but still had fundamental flaws . His timepiece from 1759 known as No 4 was the breakthrough instrument and in many ways it was really a big watch . Its size and accuracy and the subsequent nautical timepieces that followed , known as chronometers from the Greek god Chronos who had- a strong connection to time in their mythology , - finally made time differences a practical method for calculating a meridian of longitude. - The ships had their clocks- and the clocks were set to one star- the sun . <h> MERIDIANS <p> Meridians are relatively easy to visualize and understand . They are the circles around the earth passing through the North Pole to South Pole that allow us to divide the parallel lines or circles of latitude into equal divisions. - They look like the lines dividing a peeled orange into segments . These are also called great circles and each meridian of longitude is the same diameter , whereas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> On charts however , the circles of latitude and longitude often end up being projectedor drawn out - as a straight line . On charts covering a small area these straight lines are only a very tiny portion of the overall circle they are part of . In fact they represent a curved arc of the bigger circle . <p> By convention the position of any point on the Earth is located by its meridian of longitude and its parallel of - latitude . Each meridian is perpendicular to all circles of latitude . As noted , each meridian is also the same length and equal to the circumference of the Earth , as each meridian is a great circle dividing the Earth into two equal hemispheres . <p> The term " meridian " comes from the Latin word for midday meridies , highlighting again the connection between the sun and how it can give an exact time at one point each day . When the sun crosses directly above each meridian midway between the times of sunrise and sunset , it is midday for that meridian . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whereas the length of the day between sunrise and sunset quite obviously varies throughout the year , so those times are also variable. - Midday can be determined each day and timepieces can be checked against the time of midday and reset or a correction can be made . <p> Midday became a datum as it appeared to remain constant . <p> A datum meridian is needed as an origin to work from , and to be universally manageable that datum needs universal acceptance . <p> In 1851 , ( Sir ) George Airy began observing at Greenwich with a new transit circle , an accurate telescope that is operated in a plane aligned north south . It is used to locate the time at which a star crosses the meridian , as it travels from East to West across the sky , and the angle of the star above the horizon . From these measurements the transit of the sun and other stars across the meridian can be used to set the clocks at an observatory . <p> From then on , this instrument defined the prime meridian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other instruments ) by his predecessors . The meridian defined by Airys transit instrument also became the prime meridian for the UK ( and the basis of national time ) . This prime meridian passed through the Royal Observatory , Greenwich , which had been set up much earlier to begin the task of charting the moon and stars and help resolve the Lunar Distance method . <p> The chart shows latitude and longitude lines , but being French , here the datum meridian for longitude passes through Paris . <p> ANMM Collection : 00008707 . <p> In October 1884 delegates from 25 nations met in Washington , D.C. , USA , for the International Meridian Conference , and here the Greenwich Meridian was recommended as the official prime meridian of 0 degrees , and in time accepted as such around the world . <p> For decades the prime meridian was then understood to pass through the Airy Transit and its line was indicated with a brass then later stainless steel strip in the courtyard , where millions have had their image taken . From late 1999 , it has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thames and London at night . <p> However , our modern Global Positioning System ( GPS ) receivers that work to the earth 's center of gravity - as a datum point show the - Prime Meridian at Greenwich as a line - approximately 5.3 seconds to the west of Airy 's meridian. - If you have been there this means the GPS prime meridian runs beside one of the walking paths in the park surrounds just to the east , on the Vanbrugh Park side . - The historic Prime Meridian is based on vertical measurements defined by local gravity at Greenwich and this has caused the misalignment of the two meridians . The GPS meridian is now defined so that the time measured from the Prime Meridian using astronomical methods is exactly the same as time measured from the new ( GPS ) meridian using satellite technology . <p> A further complication for the meridians and time sets in with the time zones created around the globe , 12 each east and west of the prime meridian . The time zone divisions running north and south are often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many cases borders within them , but they cover about 15 degrees of longitude each . - In each time zone the actual time correct to that of the sun occurs on only one meridian . <p> The 360 degrees division of circles was the obvious means of dividing the equator into meridians , and they were denoted east and west of the meridian from 0 to 180 degrees , rather than running around continually and numbered in 360 degrees . <p> Now , the point was made earlier that- Midday became a datum as it appeared to remain constant- the problem is it 's not neatly constant . Midday actually moves by 14 to 16 minutes or so either side of an average or mean time . Why ? The earth 's motion relative the sun is not a piece of perfect geometry , and this term relative that has crept in a few places now will come back later on. - At this point in the discussion it 's enough to know that the earth 's circular orbit- with the sun at the centre is- not forming a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constant speed , and neither does it take exactly 24 hours for earth to do one rotation , or exactly 365 days to do one orbit of the sun . In other words there is a host of tiny upsetting things that together become significant and so the fractional parts have to be added in every now and then , such as a leap year with an extra day . <p> So , having ' aligned ' the modern discrepancy in the location of the prime meridian , the actual time the sun crosses the meridian has its own variation to contend with too , and with some patience and maths the variation can be accounted for , as we will see later on . <p> Meanwhile our elegant time solution now has some rough edges , but they can be smoother out . 
@@77262518 @5962518/ <h> Northbridge Senior Class <p> The Northbridge Senior class also known as the NS 14 was created in the early 1960s at the Northbridge Sailing Club in Sydney , NSW . It is a development class sailed by two crew , with a number of limitations to the hull and rig dimensions . The principle design concept came from pilot Frank Bethwaite who was later well known as a sailing weather consultant , and designer of small planing dinghies . He was member of the support team for a number of Olympic campaigns as a meteorologist in the 1970s . The class has grown from club to national status and in 2001 remains one of the few Australian created sailing classes popular throughout the country , with a strong membership and continued design development . The class has been pioneered new hull shapes , but is best known for adopting the over-rotating airfoil shaped mast and refining this to a high standard . <p> The Northbridge Senior began around 1960/61 as a simple idea to create a contemporary , fast sailing dinghy . New Zealand pilot , scientist and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ late 1950s and settled in Northbridge on the upper reaches of Sydney 's Middle Harbour . He brought with him his own NZ designed Cherub class 12 footer , a high performance planing dinghy designed by ex pat Australian John Spencer . <p> Bethwaite sailed the Cherub with his wife in the mixed fleet Senior Dinghy group at the Northbirdge Sailing Club , but did not use the boat 's trapeze or spinnaker that were normally associated with the Cherub . Even so , it had startling performance against the other craft due to its light weight and more modern , planing hull shape . This caused considerable interest amongst members who realised that no class existed to match the qualities of the boat in this arrangement . Eight club members formed a syndicate to build a new boat that met the following requirements : it could be handled by two adults of ordinary strength both in the water and out , sailed comforatbly without trapezes , as fast as possible consistent with reasonable stability , and carry no spinnaker . <p> Two boats were built , based on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet long . They gave it 100sq feet of sail area over the main and jib , on an 18 foot long mast . Members trialled both craft extensively in 1961 , and by October it was reported that up to eleven more craft were in various stages of construction . This was an enourmous vote of confidnece in the concept , and gave the class a solid foundation leading into 1962 , all after just one season of sailing . The rules agreed to were quite simple , 14 feet long , maximum beam 6 feet , and 4 ft 1in minimum beam at the waterline , 140lb minimum hull weight and 100 sq feet maximum sail area , two crew , no trapezes . <p> By the middle of 1964 there were 50 Northbridge Seniors racing at nine different clubs in NSW , and a state association was formed in June 1965 , with an ACT division formed soon after . By the end of the 1960s there were fleets established in each state . In the 1970s the national series became very popular regardless of whaer it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ability to tow or even cartop the boat made ti relatvely easy to transport and turn the event into part of the annual summer holiday experience . <p> Hull shapes quickly became more advanced as different designers followed thier ideas and eveolved a something new each year .

In 2011 it remains a very popular and well supported class through out Australia with a strong association .

@@77262523 @5962523/ <p> TAIPAN is an 18-Foot skiff class sailing dinghy built in Queensland in 1959 at Norman Wright 's yard in Bulimba . TAIPAN was designed by Bob Miller , later known as Ben Lexcen , who worked with Norman Wright jnr on the concept and then the construction . It was a revolutionary craft in the 18-Foot skiff class , paving the way for the extreme planing vessels of the 21st century . TAIPAN helped begin a successful design career for Miller , culminating in the design of the America 's Cup winning yacht AUSTRALIA II in 1983 . <p> DescriptionTAIPAN revolutionized the 18-foot skiff class after its debut in late 1959 . TAIPAN 's principal designer was Bob Miller , and he explored a completely new concept for the class , supported by Norman Wright Jnr , for whom he worked at the time . The craft was built close to the minimum beam of 6 ft ( 1.83 m ) with a lightweight , single-chine , vee-shaped planing hull built from plywood , three crew , overlapping headsails and some decking . This was almost the opposite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 6 man crews . <p> The opportunity for Miller to create the design for TAIPAN probably would not have happened if he had not been working for Norman Wright Jnr . At Wrights invitation he had moved to Brisbane in the late 1950s to work for the boatbuilders Norman Wright and Sons where he was employed as a sail maker in their subsidiary business called Florite Sails . Wright was an experienced sailor and long-time supporter of the 18-Foot skiff class in Brisbane . The skiffs he had designed , built and skippered all had the name JENNY and were champion craft in their time . He had recognised Miller 's talent as a sail maker , but at the time perhaps did not realise what Miller 's personality was like . It was apparent quite early when Miller arrived unannounced on their doorstep ready to start work , and then ended up living with Helen and Norman Wright Jnr for some time while he was in Brisbane . <p> The 18-Foot skiff class in Queensland was in a gradual decline in the late 1950s , and the Queensland 18-Foot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Norman Wright Jnr considered the idea of a single chine plywood hull as a fast and less expensive concept ; meanwhile , while still based in Sydney , this idea was something that had already been created in Miller 's fertile mind . For Miller it began as an idea from his experience with friends sailing on the Flying Dutchman class . They knew that this fast 2-handed craft from Europe could beat an 18-foot skiff upwind , and Miller could see how to adapt the concept of a lightweight hull and high performance rig to the 18-foot skiff class . He was also aware of Uffa Fox 's many planing dinghies for the International 14-Foot class from reading Fox 's books , and another influence at that time was probably the WA 14-foot skiff DARKIE which was featured in SEACRAFT and in turn had elements of the Sydney VJ class , another lightweight chine , plywood skiff . <p> The opportunity arose for Miller to put his ideas into a real project when he injured himself quite badly falling from a mast and spent time in hospital recovering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could use in bed , and amongst the things he drew were sketches or plans that were the basis of the TAIPAN . Wright was also familiar with the comparative speed of the Flying Dutchman and even the relatively new Light-Weight Sharpie class , yet another chine hull form , between the two personalities there was a wealth of experience and new ideas . Surviving documents include the lines plan drawn by Miller for TAIPAN with various notations including a reference to DARKIE in one comer , and a calculation by someone for the displacement . <p> When he returned to work Miller began building the boat later in 1959 , but his impatience was evident as the project slowed . Wright had to get others in to help , notably Brian Hamilton , so that TAIPAN would be finished . Everything was built as light as possible , but Wright insisted it carry one piece of tradition , the stem was fashioned from a grown knee section as used on the JENNY hulls . <p> Brian Hamilton and Norman 's son Norman Wright III were the crew for Miller @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the class . TAIPAN 's early racing race was unspectacular . Sailing first with borrowed sails from a Flying Dutchman class dinghy it failed to perform , but when it finally raced with its full sized battened main and overlapping genoa TAIPAN sailed away from the fleet to be over a leg in front on the Brisbane River course . TAIPAN then went on to win a number of races in the early part of 1960 . At different times Miller experimented with endplates and fences on both the rudder and centreboard , as well as developing better sails and understanding how to get the most out of this new concept . After the Queensland State titles TAIPAN was chosen to represent Queensland in Auckland New Zealand for the world title contest later in that summer . <p> TAIPAN was regarded as the outstanding boat at the World Championship , even though it failed to win and only finished fourth . Prompted by dissension from Sydney club representatives , the race committee judged that it was not built to the rules with regard to its decking , even though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boat . Miller was forced to cut large holes in the fore and aft deck panels which weakened the hull and caused it to take on more water . Twice it was dismasted , but despite all these setbacks it showed enough speed and potential for its rivals to realize that this was the future of the class . It nearly won the first race despite not setting a spinnaker , won another race by a substantial margin , and was leading comfortably in a third race when the rig fell down . <p> On its return to Australia , TAIPAN took part in a special challenge race on Botany Bay late in March 1960 . Racing against a champion 16-foot skiff and one of the best of the Sydney 18-foot skiffs , TAIPAN won comfortably without needing to set a spinnaker and on a course that probably favoured the best point of sail for a 16-foot skiff . TAIPAN was sailed in the race by Miller 's close friend Carl Ryves , who had never sailed the boat before and this further underlined the dominance of the concept . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ support , then built a new and very streamlined hull he called VENOM . It had straighter lines in its run aft , and the cockpit and decking allowed for the rule interpretations that had been an issue with TAIPAN . VENOM went on to dominate and win the next world championship with Craig Whitworth in the crew as a steadying influence . This ensured that the concept started by TAIPAN became the path for all future designs . TAIPAN changed hands , and as CRYSTAL LAD won the Australian title a year later with Len Heffernan of NSW at the helm . Eventually the craft found its way to owners in the ACT early in the 1980s , but it was in need of repair . The final owner in Canberra rebuilt various parts of the structure and it sailed again on Lake Burley Griffin . In the late 1980s the owner donated the historic craft to the Australian National Maritime Museum where it is now part of the National Maritime Collection . <p> In 2007 a project was completed which has restored TAIPAN to its early 1960 arrangement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curatorial and conservation staff , Sydney Harbour Wooden Boats expertly rebuilt the hull and rig based on plans prepared at the museum by curator David Payne . These plans were developed from details seen on contemporary images , evidence of structure on the existing hull , and detailed advice or recollections of people involved with TAIPAN during this period , including Bob McLeod , Carl Ryves , Brian Hamilton and Norman Wright III . In mid-October TAIPAN sailed again , and looked just as it did when it created a furore in 1960 . <p> The story of TAIPAN captures the key elements of the life of its creative designer . Miller was always ready to experiment with new and original ideas , and not only was the whole concept quite novel in the class , but he also continued his experiments with endplates on the rudder and centreboard .

@@77262529 @5962529/ <h> Walter Reeks <h> 1861-1925 <p> Walter Reeks ( 1861 - 1925 ) has strong claims to being Australia 's first full time professional naval architect . He worked as a marine designer throughout his time in Sydney , and avaliable records indicate that no one before him appears to have had this occupation as their sole means of employment . Reeks ' career was marked with numerous successful vessel designs , many with unorthodox features . Some craft are still extant in Australia . <p> Background : <p> Reeks was born in Christchurch , England in 1861 and trained there with apprenticeships to naval architect Alex Richardson and then George Inman and Sons , Shipbuilder , before leaving England and coming to Sydney in 1885 . <p> He immediately established his own naval architecture practice , promoting his abilities with successful modifications to existing yachts and a small number of new designs . He was the dominant Australian yacht designer from 1885 until 1893 . Most of these were for racing yachts , generally gaff-rigged cutters with a deep keel and a plumb stem opposed by a long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commercial field from 1892 with designs for double ended steam ferries on Sydney Harbour , including almost all of the Lady class vessels up to 1915 , and the first two screw propelled Manly ferries . He also pioneered some of the designs for river trading and passenger steamers used in NSW and Tasmania , and other commercial craft . He is known to have prepared plans of pearling luggers for James Clark , the major force in the Torres Strait pearling industry . These designs appear to have been quite different and to have helped establish the distinctive style of Thursday Island lugger . At the same time Reeks maintained interest in cruising yacht and motor launch design . Most were typical Edwardian style vessels <p> Designs by Reeks were always well proportioned , elegant and well engineered , but unorthodox features were occasionally tried at different periods . For example , many of his early ferries had a very distinctive and perhaps unique rockered or cambered keel profile , and some of the later double-ended craft only had a propeller at one end . His last yacht design @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was a failure but none the less typifies his desire to try something quite different . <p> There was an entrepreneurial style in the way he managed his business at times ; for example in 1892 he became both designer and builder for some of the ferries and luggers , engaging Thomas Cubitt 's existing yard and shipwrights to work under his own name . This arrangement lasted about 12 months . <p> It appears he worked alone as a designer with no employees , and only a few plans or other original documents now exist . Indications from his Deceased Estate file are that his plans and information were passed onto an unnamed naval architect upon Reeks death . <p> Significant vessels : <p> Yachts : ERA ( 1887 ) and ISEA ( 1888 ) were the first two racing yachts built anywhere in the world to the new Length and Sail Area rule .

BONA ( 1903 ) was later renamed BOOMERANG and remains afloat as one of the most elegant Edwardian schooner designs of that period . <p> Launches and steam yachts : WAHINE ( 1902 ) Reeks ' own craft was powered by a petrol motor and had an unusual tunnel hull .

There is strong evidence that WARATAH ( 1891 ) , and sister ships JESSIE and ISABEL created the distinct yacht like style of Thursday island pearling lugger . He also designed mother ship schooners for the pearling fleet including ALADDIN ( 1892 ) . SS ENDEAVOUR ( 1907 ) , a fisheries investigation vessel , was built at Cockatoo Island , Sydney and noted in contemporary reports as being one of the first examples of a large vessel that was entirely designed and built in Australia , including all the machinery . <p> Personal background : <p> Walter Reeks was generally a popular figure and well respected throughout his career .

In the early 1950s he started his own practice in Perth , Western Australia . Prior to this he had prepared a number of designs for yachts and other craft , working on the projects in his spare time . He designed a wide range of craft over a 50-year period before retiring as a well respected figure in both the recreational and commercial fields of watercraft design . <p> Background : <p> From an early age Len spent much of his spare time around the Swan River and associated waterways , building canoes and improvising with home made sails . As a teenager in the 1930s he visited Perth boatyards on the banks of the Swan River . Seeing a boat being built inspired him , at just 15 , to design one himself .

The early design work consisted of yachts and low powered launches . <p> Amongst this early work , he designed the 14 foot DARKIE series for the owner-skipper , Syd Corser , who dominated state and national titles for a number of years . Throughout his career , Len designed a number of racing and cruising yachts in wood , aluminum , steel and fibreglass . <p> However , it was fishing boats that launched his commercial career . For decades they had been low powered craft modeled by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was right . The introduction of higher powered diesel engines was a significant change and needed someone able to calculate the power and propeller requirements , along with the best hull shape and construction if the craft was to achieve its desired performance . Randell had the technical expertise to capitalize on this need and soon started working with builders to produce good designs . This work then expanded into prawn trawlers , cray boats and carrier boats , and this combination of craft formed a significant part of his career 's output . The heavy displacement craft were built in wood , aluminum and steel . <p> Other commercial craft included a small number of ferries , patrol boats and tugs . As one of the few qualified naval architects in WA and well known for his quality work , Randell was well positioned to take on new commissions as the industrial strength of WA grew from the 1960s onwards .

The operators realized the value in being able to get to and from their cray fishing areas much faster , and Randell designed a great number of craft that could move quickly between port and the cray fishing areas , and also function well as stable platforms for laying and hauling cray pots .

@@77262536 @5962536/ <p> AVIAN was built in the late 1930s by JJ Savage , well known yacht and boat builders from Williamstown , Victoria . It is a Scandanavian designed Tumlaren class yacht - an international design adapted to Australian conditions . It is an early example of International class designs becoming established in Australia , and marks the beginning of a trend that saw local yacht designs and classes decline in favour of international designs . The Tumlaren class was adopted in Victoria in the 1930s when Port Phillip yacht clubs were looking to establish one design fleet racing after a series of gales earlier in the 1930s had destroyed many yachts moored on he eastern side of the bay .

The canoe sterned hull with a deep keel was also a common Scandanavian style and the combination of features produced a seaworthy and fast yacht well suited to racing on the often rough open waters of Port Phillip .

In its last few years STEPHEN BROWN also carried blue-metal and sugar as bulk cargoes , loaded on from wharves at Ballina and Harwood near Yamba . This involved negotiating the bar entrances on the Richmond and Clarence Rivers . <p> Ross Curline was the ship 's master from 1954 until the mid 1960s . He recalls that STEPHEN BROWN was a reliable vessel , but came close to being lost early in its career . Tony Robinson the Chief Engineer also had vivid recollections of the incident . <p> With a load of steaming coal aboard STEPHEN BROWN left Hexham for Sydney sailing into a strong southerly gale .

As STEPHEN BROWN approached Sydney the extant of the problem became obvious as it developed a list , which became very significant when the hull sides at deck level began to go underwater . Aware of the danger , the skipper Don Turner initially proposed to beach the vessel inside South Head at Lady Jane Beach . However in the end this was not needed , instead they stood off the beach and organised to pump some of the water out before limping up the harbour to the CSR berth to discharge their cargo . <p> Subsequently the air vent openings aft were raised to remain clear of deck wash , and the hatches were strengthened , but what probably saved the vessel in the first place was its high stability , known in naval architecture terms as a high GM ( the vertical centre of gravity to metacentre distance ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . STEPHEN BROWN was originally planned to have the deck-mounted cargo gear proposed by Hewett , and this weight was factored into the original design calculations and proportions of the vessel . However , without this heavy gear on deck , the vessel operated with greater stability than originally planned , and this greater margin allowed it to remain afloat despite the additional water and extreme list it had developed . The negative side of this high stability was that it had a quicker rolling period and its transverse motion was not as comfortable as other vessels . <p> When the STEPHEN BROWN was retired from service it was saved from being scrapped and sunk as an artificial reef to instead become an educational vessel for the Australian Maritime College in Launceston , Tasmania . The vessel was donated to the college in April 1983 by the owners , Coal and Allied Industries Limited ( who had taken over the original firm of owners ) .

The VOC 's activities were focused on discovering and exploiting new profitable ventures in the east , as opposed to acquiring territorial possessions . It was in this context that the earliest Dutch engagement with the Australian mainland and its indigenous inhabitants was established , when the VOC 's Willem Jansz , captain of the Duyfken ( Little Dove ) , was sent by the Governor-General at Bantam ( now Banten ) to explore the legendary island of gold , New Guinea .

The Brouwer route instructed ships to maintain an easterly course for at least a thousand mijlen ( an old Dutch mile , equivalent to approximately four modern nautical miles ) , or about 7,400 kilometres , after rounding the Cape of Good Hope , before heading north towards the Sunda Strait between Sumatra and Java .

@@77262563 @5962563/ <h> A &amp; H Green <p> Many generations of Green family have been successful boat builders in Sydney . They have also had great success in rowing and sculling , beginning with brothers Richard , George and Henry in the mid 1800s , then later on in the 1900s , the twins A&amp;H Green . However their connection to boatbuilding begins much earlier , when the colony of NSW was still in its infancy centred on Sydney Harbour . <p> The first member of the Green family to build vessels in Sydney was George Green . He was 12 when he became an apprentice with Thomas Day whose yard was on the edge of Cockle Bay , now Darling Harbour in 1822 . George had been born in Camberwell , Surrey , England and came out to Sydney to live with an uncle and aunt , who had promised to find him employment as a condition of him being allowed to emigrate . His apprenticeship took seven years . In 1834 his parents and five of his siblings secured passage to Sydney as well , firmly establishing the colony @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he married Maria Bates in 1830 , she was the daughter of boatbuilder Thomas Bates and lived nearby to his aunt and uncle . Little is known of the vessels George was involved with , apart from the yacht FRIENDSHIP which he built for James Milson Jnr . It was a champion yacht on Sydney Harbour in the 1840s . His sailing involvement included racing on the harbour , and there is a record from the 1838 Anniversary Regatta showing how George Green took an advantage in a race staring off Dawes Point . He chose to start on the opposite shore , Milsons Point , and put himself well to windward of his competitors . He reasoned that Milsons Point was indeed off Dawes Point as well . <p> His first three sons , the second generation , became very well known as boat builders and scullers . The eldest son , George Amaziah became a boat builder and designer in Sydney , as did the second son Henry Thomas , whilst the third son , Richard Augustus Willoughby ( RAW Green ) was better known as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shipwright . A sixth son Charles John also entered the trade , but he worked in Riverton , on the south island of New Zealand . <p> There is a significant New Zealand part of the Green story . In this period there was considerable movement between the colonies , with no strong national Australian or New Zealand identity yet forged . Consequently there was considerable movement of people between the various colonies , on both a short and long term basis . <p> George ( senior ) went to the South Island in 1838 and made many land purchases from Maori chiefs , including Stewart Island , then returned to Sydney for a period before moving back to an area near Riverton in 1858-59 . There he stayed until he died in 1872 . He was joined in New Zealand by members of his family including Henry Thomas who arrived around 1864 . Records from New Zealand show that George had established a boatbuilding yard in Dunedin before Henry 's arrival , but subsequently it was Henry who is known to have designed and built the significant vessels recorded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the three most well known , and they had intriguing features . It is clear from contemporary descriptions and one section sketch of ZEPHYR that all three had veed sections and arc shaped longitudinal lines that were similar to the radical yacht AUSTRALIAN from 1858 , designed by Richard Hartnett and built at Woolloomooloo by Dan Sheehy . RIPPLE and ZEPHYR both featured a heavily raked mast , with an almost vertical sliding gunter yard supported by cross-trees and stays , that was to all intents and purposes a Bermudian rig profile . It is also understood that the craft were double planked fore and aft . <p> ZEPHYR came to Australia in 1881 and raced on Hobsons Bay and in Hobart with great success before returning to New Zealand . <p> Prior to his arrival in New Zealand it would seem that Henry and his brother George were already preparing their own radical designs , the principal evidence being the tubular rowing scull STAR OF AUSTRALIA . This unique craft was probably designed by George and built by Henry , and it was intended for their brother Richard Green @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use in a challenge for the unofficial title of the Champion of the World . By undertaking this challenge Richard probably became Australia 's first international sportsman to take part in an event outside of the country . He trialed the unusual craft which created great interest , but eventually raced in a heavier conventional craft . This single scull is described in an advertisement for its sale in England in 1863 as a Patent Tubular Wager boat , and the advertisement also indicates that a model for a Lifeboat or Pilot Boat designed along the Elliptic Tubular Principle was also available for viewing . The same lifeboat concept was displayed in Auckland in the early 1880s . Clearly the Green brothers were prepared to look at unorthodox ideas and try them out as well . <p> Their boatshed was located on the eastern side of Milsons Point and it is understood that they built rowing craft for Richard , for themselves and for others , as well as skiffs such as butcher boats .

This shed was probably started by George Green ( Snr ) , but it is not known what happened to the site when Henry left for New Zealand in 1864 to join his father while his brothers George and Richard remained in Australia . <p> Henry returned to Sydney in 1889 some years after the death of his father in New Zealand . He set up a yard in Lavender Bay toward the northern end and lived not far from the yard , in Alfred St near St Leonard 's Park . Records show that in the next 20 years of boatbuilding he built yachts and launches . Amongst these were a small yacht design by Walter Reeks called EVELYN in 1899 , a radical looking launch in 1902 called WAHINE also designed by Reeks ( who was the owner ) , the elegant Fife designed 30 ft Linear rater SCOTIA and then another 30 ft linear rater , the more awkward looking KUKUBURRA designed by its owner AE Cutler . Two smaller linear raters are also mentioned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continued in the Greens with at least one of RAW Green 's sons . Augustus Stuart ' Gus ' Green settled in Cobaki on the northern NSW coast and built the trawler X.L.C.R at Iluka in the early 1900s . Another son was Richard and his sons Richard , Robert and twins Augustus ' Gus ' and Harry also became involved in the trade . Richard , Robert and Gus served shipwright apprenticeships on Cockatoo Island , rowing across from their home at Greenwich . Robert then became a dock master at Garden Island , Richard a foreman with Patrick Shipping Company . Gus became a champion sculler and eventually moved to the northern rivers of NSW which was a centre for professional sculling with people such as Fischer and Paddon . <p> Harry Green served in the army during World War I and when he returned Gus joined him in Sydney to set up a shed on a waterfront property purchased from Thomas Kemp at Teviot Street , Abbotsford on the Parramatta River . They concentrated on building racing craft for the rowing clubs , schools and eventually some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ built the full range , from single sculls up to the big eights . They were also keen on sailing and built a skiff EVELYN which they sailed together along with a third crew member Jono Anderson . Harry left the business they had called A&amp;H Green to settle in the Tweed River region later in the 1920s and Gus carried it on . The great Bobby Pearce used sculls built by A&amp;H Green for almost all of his significant wins , including the 1930 Empire Games , the prestigious Diamonds at Henley Royal Regatta in 1931 , his second Olympic Gold medal in 1932 and subsequent professional victories up until World War II . Although he lived in Canada from 1930 onwards , he preferred the Green built craft from his native home of Sydney . Success for Green built craft continued after the war ; Mervyn Wood rowed a Green single scull called KINGFISHto win Gold in the 1948 Olympics at London . Then in 1956 , Evans Paddon rowed an A&amp;H Green scull to become the last professional sculling world champion . <p> The business prospered before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yard , like most other yards , turned to building vessels for the services , including lifeboats , rescue boats and work craft such as tugs . <p> Gus had two sons , Maurice and Barry . Maurice joined his father during the war to become the fifth generation of Green shipwrights in Sydney since George Green was apprenticed to the trade at 12 in 1822 . Maurice was also interested in sailing and built his own VJ , then a 12 foot Skiff CRUSADER which he raced successfully on the Parramatta River . <p> Gus sold the shed at Abbotsford in the early 1950s to members of Sydney High School , and then moved north to the Tweed River to join his brother . Gus retained an interest in the trade building a few craft and helping at the local rowing club . He and his twin brother died within a few days of each other in May 1971 .

He returned to Sydney for a short period to work for Greens Racing Boats , and then went to work for the rival firm George Towns and Sons . In 1963 he returned to Queensland . <p> Meanwhile Maurice moved north to Newcastle and worked with his shipwright cousin Eric Green at the State Dockyard , building lifeboats and working on the construction of the bulk carrier KOOJARA . <p> Maurice returned to Sydney to work with Sportscraft building small speedboats and in his own spare time at home he built the successful racing hydroplane MISS BORON .

This was a sign of the times , they were fibreglass boat builders and the reign of the wooden boatbuilder was now at an end . However Maurice still preferred to work in timber , so he designed and built his own 10.2 metre long wooden cruiser KIMBALEE , and soon after he retired from boatbuilding altogether . This craft probably marks the end of the Green family boatbuilding in Sydney . <p> There were other Green connections who made their mark . Kenneth Goswell , a cousin of Barry and Maurice was also a champion sculler . He started rowing at 14 and won many championships for Queensland at interstate regattas .

It was used for off the beach fishing at Seaford on the eastern shoreline of Port Phillip .

The boats were called a flattie as they originally worked around the mud flats at Fishermans Bend and an 1890 survey map of the Yarra River shows where these mud flats once were . One common feature to many of the early craft was that the straight keel profile was formed with three 100mm ( 4 inch ) wide planks tapering to both ends . This gave a flat bottom which they sat on out of the water . This craft is more modern in construction , it has a small section-sized exterior keel which also runs straight and parallel to the waterline throughout . At the aft end over the last 750 mm , the clinker hull planking rises about 75mm on the centreline to give a higher tuck at the transom and a small deadwood or skeg effect .

Beazley says he saw the family once bring a tip truck load of snapper into the fish market with no ice and it was all rotten . Their trade was eventually stopped due to perceptions of serious overfishing by recreational fishing people . <p> The family considered restoring the boat before Beazley persuaded them to give him the boat to restore . For a period it used as a floating store for Beazley 's own nets , then he and his son David restored the boat . They decided to put a deck on it to help it hold its shape , originally it would have been an open boat , but it is now more versatile and safer to use in open water and rough conditions .

@@77262588 @5962588/ <h> Ben Lexcen <h> 1936 - 1988 <p> Ben Lexcen ( Bob Miller ) has a special place in yachting history as the designer of the yacht Australia II which first won the Americas Cup from the Americans . Lexcen was always trying different ideas and prepared to move in a different direction , but not always with immediate success . <p> Personal background : <p> Ben Lexcen was born Robert Clyde Miller in Boggabri , NSW , March 19 1936 , and had a difficult early life with only 5 years of formal schooling . He was abandoned by his parents and ended up in the care of his grandfather in Newcastle . They lived in New Lambton near the border of Adamstown and Broadmeadow . There he began to take a keen interest in the sea and boats . Warren Elliott was a school friend whe they both attended Cook 's Hill Intermediate High School in Newcastle , and he recalled the following : <p> " Rob ( Ben ) was always drawing sailing boats and in particular sails . He would do this at any opportunity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been sitting next to each other for two years as I recall one year convincing him to join in a sweep we had going for the Melbourne Cup . He was very reluctant to do so but , after much persuasion from myself , he put in sixpence for a horse . Much to his surprise and mine - his horse won . The winnings would have been only about five shillings . ( Fifty cents in today 's currency ) . He was n't an outward going lad but , more the quiet type keeping mainly to himself . " <p> After leaving schoolat the end of 1954 he went to work for the NSW State Railways and was apprenticed as a fitter and turner . While working there he built his first boat . In his early twenties he learnt sail making , and moved to Sydney . Sailing and related work then became his full time occupation . <p> In Sydney he formed a close and lasting friendship with the Ryves family at Hunters Hill , and especially with Carl Ryves with whom he often sailed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sailed together on Carl 's Flying Dutchman and Bob built a catamaran of his own design . <p> In the late 1950s Norman Wright in Brisbane invited Bob to leave Sydney and join his boatyard to run the new sail making part of the business . In typical fashion he arrived to start work unannounced and penniless , but the Wrights took him in and he joined both the firm and the family . He remained there until 1961 when another friendship and partnership was formed with Craig Whitworth and the two won an inter-dominion championship in the Flying Dutchman class . At the end of this event they decided to set up a sail making business in Sydney where the market was much bigger . Again , with little concern for the consequences he appeared to simply abandon the Wrights who had acted as his parents , sponsors and tutor while he was with them and started afresh under the banner of Miller and Whitworth . <p> The Miller and Whitworth firm was a success from its brash beginnings with full page adds in the sailing magazines . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clients from all over Australia and some from overseas . <p> In the mid 1970s Miller abandoned this partnership and moved on , initially alone but for the 1977 America 's Cup design he was partnered by Johan Valentjin , an ex Sparkman and Stevens employee . This arrangement survived for a short time beyond the Cup series and some more yacht designs were completed before this partnership also folded . By now Miller had become exasperated by the fact that his name could be used by previous businesses with whom he was no longer associated . In an impetuous act , he simply changed his name , and almost overnight it was Ben Lexcen , but nothing else had changed . <p> The America 's Cup win in 1983 allowed Lexcen to set up a sizable office with intentions of becoming an established international design firm . The office was successful but in May 1988 Lexcen died of a sudden and massive heart attack . <p> Lexcen was often helped toward his success with the assistance of others who could provide a balance to his energy and full speed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guided Miller and Whitworth 's fortunes while Miller attracted the clients and provided the creative input . As well there the other team members that were employed at different times , such as Joe Adams , John King and Peter Lowe . As draftsmen and designers they could take the concepts or handle the details and help turn Lexcen 's ideas into finished designs . He was constantly active , creative and his temper had a very short fuse . This hyper activity was probably related to his long term problems with high blood pressure that contributed to the cause of his death . He died at a time when he still had much to offer as someone prepared to look for and try ideas that were outside of the mainstream . <p> Lexcen ( as Miller ) first married in 1961 but this only lasted about 2 years . He later married Yvonne his second wife in 1974 . She had two children from a previous marriage , and grandchildren . <p> Design background : <p> When Miller went to Queensland he was self taught in boat design practices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Manfred Curry 's Yacht racing text and the many books by Uffa Fox . When Norman Wright began thinking of a new plywood 18-foot skiff for the Queensland clubs , it was Bob who had the radical ideas that led to the TAIPAN and then the VENOM . At the yard he had a serious accident falling from a mast and was in hospital for some months . Norman made him a drafting board and it was there that Bob first put his ideas for TAIPAN onto paper . <p> He was able to think laterally and grasp ideas quite quickly , including complex engineering concepts . He could sketch and draw with excellent skills when necessary , but often his mind was ahead of his hand as he moved quickly to develop an idea , or jump to a new one leaving the old one only partially formed . VENOM was never first drawn out as a plan , ideas appear to have been quickly sketched over a drawing of TAIPAN , and the boat designed full size on the loft floor . <p> Significant Vessels . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a designer . Both boats adapted features from the Flying Dutchman to create craft unlike any others in the skiff fleet . His temper , a lack of attention to detail , and pedantic rule interpretations by disgruntled opponents held TAIPAN back and it did not achieve the success that it appeared headed towards . When Craig Whitworth joined the crew on VENOM , his steadying hand complemented Bob 's larrikin style and VENOM won the world championship for 1961 . Other skiff designs similar to TAIPAN were drawn for 18-foot skiffs and 16-foot skiffs . <p> At Miller and Whitworth , whilst still designing sails and some skiffs , designs for yachts began to appear , including a major part of co-designing the successful MERCEDES III for Ted Kaufmann , and later working with Joe Adams to design the half-tonner PLUM CRAZY . The IYRU established a competition for a new single handed class , and Bob Miller 's Contender class prototype was chosen . VOLANTE was designed for a New Zealand client and then the famous APOLLO was designed and built . The client was Alan Bond , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was developed from VOLANTE . APOLLO was a lightweight 57 foot sloop not unlike an ocean going Flying Dutchman . It had an impressive race career and became a legend in Australian ocean racing . <p> His major work in ocean racing design came from Gary Bogard 's GINKGO , designed for the Admirals Cup in the early 1970s . The IOR rule was now well established , but its measurement point mentality was yet to become completely dominant . Miller adopted a different approach to other designers with a very clean looking easily driven hull shape and relatively low sail area . With an enthusiastic crew GINKGO had a successful career , as did its sister ship , the alloy APOLLO II . Two smaller derivatives with the same concept , CEIL III and RAMPAGE went on to win the Hobart race , while APOLLO II flourished a second time when the IMS rule was introduced in the 1980s . Other custom and production yacht designs also used the same concept but were not as successful , and the second generation of bigger designs , APOLLO III and RAGAMUFFIN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Holland . <p> In the meantime he had been able to turn his attention towards the America 's Cup and 12 metre designs , as Alan Bond set out on his quest for the cup and glory . SOUTHERN CROSS , the 1974 challenger was again not a mainstream design , and the refined American yacht COURAGEOUS was able to win 4-0 . Undeterred Bond challenged again and Miller was joined by the experienced Johan Valentjin as a steadying influence to design the next yacht , AUSTRALIA ( I ) , a yacht closer to the typical path being followed elsewhere . Although beaten 4-0 again by COURAGEOUS , the yacht had potential and was modified by Miller , now Lexcen to race again in 1980 . It sported a radical bendy mast with a fibreglass top , a concept copied from the English yacht LIONHEART . Publicly Lexcen created a smokescreen by denigrating the whole idea ; meanwhile the team secretly built their own version to Lexcen 's design , catching the Americans by surprise . Again they lost , 4-1 , but the gap was closing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ series Bond decided one more challenge , and Lexcen produced the famous AUSTRALIA II , the yacht that took the America 's Cup from the USA , who had defended it for 132 years . <p> AUSTRALIA II is the best example of this free thinking self taught designer . He identified a means of making a significant improvement to the 12 metre design with an extraordinary keel shape no one had ever considered . In his younger days whilst doing an ocean race he had observed the problems of tip vortex and drag off the keel . The eddies were highlighted by phosphorescence , while at the same time the boat he was on was rapidly falling behind the others beating to windward . He later played around with fences and endplates on his 18-foot skiff appendages , and returned to the concept at other times . <p> With AUSTRALIA II he finally had a solution that paid dividends . The keel was shaped so that it had more mass toward its base , and fitted with wings which reduced tip vortex drag , improved its efficiency and also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ optimising the hull shape and sail plan to take advantage of the greater righting moment and manoeuvrability this keel offered , AUSTRALIA II was almost a generation ahead of its contemporaries and especially dominant in light to moderate conditions . <p> Lexcen also engineered many of the fittings always seeking the lightest option , and two gear failures possibly attributed to this put the yacht down 3 wins to 2 at one point . The crew however knew they had the faster boat and climbed back to win the cup in a thrilling final race , seizing the lead downwind under spinnaker on the second last leg and holding off LIBERTY 's determined tacking duels on the final beat to the finish line . <p> With his new post 1983 office various projects for yachts and power craft were undertaken . For the 1987 defence he produced AUSTRALIA III and IV , but neither boat showed the dominance of AUSTRALIA II and the Iain Murray managed KOOKABURRA team won the right to defend the cup , but were then beaten by the USA challenger . <p> The new holders of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caught by a surprise challenge from New Zealand based on an interpretation of the Deed of Gift which allowed them to use a 90 foot waterline monohull . Lexcen and Bond enjoyed the audacity of the move . Hoping that multiple challengers might be accepted they began sketching a concept for a challenger , but it was during this process that Lexcen died and no yacht eventuated from his preliminary ideas .

It also represents the beginning of the three generations of the Ward family - Wally , his son John and grandson Ian- who were all well-known sailors on Sydney Harbour , and followed a similar pattern of self-taught design and success with their respective craft . <p> DescriptionJANAWAY was built in unusual circumstances for a yacht by shipwright Syd Perry and his son Jim . They lived on a houseboat in Middle Harbour NSW , just to the east of The Spit in Fisher Bay on the eastern or Seaforth side . JANAWAY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deck of the house boat , largely undercover of the roof , while the Perry 's lived around the hull and in areas below the main deck . This houseboat hull is still extant in the same location , but features a more modern house structure . <p> JANAWAY was carvel planked in New Zealand kauri from stock material that was left over from a lifeboat contract , with a spotted gum keel and frames . It is probably one of the last yachts built in kauri in Australia ; the supply of kauri from New Zealand stopped with World War II and was not started up again post war . An Austin 7 marine engine was fitted , the hull has a raised deck and it was rigged as a sloop . Its canoe stern was one of the features related to its fine balance when heeled , which was carefully shaped around the calculations that underpinned the 1930s English design principle promoted by Rear Admiral Turner and called the Metacentric Shelf Theory . The theory suggested that as a yacht heeled its balance was affected by the changes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ undertaken involved calculating the change in buoyancy distribution and helped the designer achieve equal buoyancy in the dissimilar ends of a design . It involved a number of calculations comparing the yacht 's heeled and level distribution of displacement . Yachts designed to this theory tended toward a symmetrical hull forms fore and aft , and usually exhibited good sailing characteristics . It was not widely adopted , possibly due to the extensive nature of the manual calculations required , and was never widely supported in professional naval architectural circles . Ward was one Australian designer known to have been influenced by the system . <p> The yacht was launched in October 1938 without a keel or ballast , the houseboat was taken to the side of the bay to where a set of sheerlegs were used to lift it up and the houseboat towed away from beneath the overhanging hull . The hull was completed with its keel and ballast casting at Griffin 's shed on The Spit , and a second launching followed soon after . It was Wally Ward 's own boat , and one of its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home by Ward in his own workshop . JANAWAY stayed with the family for 35 years . It raced successfully with Middle Harbour Yacht Club for many seasons , and was eventually taken over by Ward 's son John and his wife Nola in the mid-1950s . Various modifications were made over its life time with the Wards , including repositioning the rudder with the shaft running through the stock , increasing the sail area for better light weather performance , and fitting solid stainless steel rod for the rigging . As well as racing it was cruised extensively by the Ward family . <p> JANAWAY was followed by JASNAR in the late 1940s , a very similar hull shape built to the same theory . JASNAR was very successful as an ocean racer , and was followed by CAMIRA , then the Carmen Class and finally the big ocean racer built by Swanson Bros CAMILLE OF SEAFORTH , which represented Australia in its first Admiral 's Cup challenge in 1965 . The Carmen class included CADENCE , winner of the 1966 Sydney to Hobart yacht race , and yachts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The Wards sold JANAWAY in the mid-1970s . John designed his own yacht JACANA , which was built by Cec Quilkey in the late 1980s at Taren Point , and once again John made all the fittings himself at his workshop , inherited from his father . Meanwhile his son Ian was well known in the Moth class as a champion sailor , designer and builder of scow Moths , and he also made many of the fittings on his boats . <p> One of the subsequent owners of JANAWAY was artist John Firth-Smith , who owned and helped restore a number of classic yachts over many years . Les Soars purchased JANAWAY in the mid 1990s and gave the yacht an extensive overhaul , including a new deck and a small coach house . JANAWAY was kept in top condition by Soars up in Pittwater , and it was sold in 2006 after Soars died suddenly . The current owner sails JANAWAY regularly and it remains in fine condition . 73935 @qwx693935 
@@77262591 @5962591/ <h> 18-Foot Skiff Class <p> The 18-foot skiff class is a world recognised feature of Australian yachting and sporting culture . Along with the vision of exciting sailing on Sydney Harbour on a summer 's weekend it has close associations with the larrikin side of the Australian character . <p> There is much that is true in this broadly held conception , but it is a combination of different aspects . It is an evolving social story of a way of life for many people , an exciting example of highly skilled sailing , and a reflection of the changes in technology , factors that have all kept the class sailing for over century . <p> The 18-foot skiffs probably began as a formal class in the 1890s , and were in many respects a smaller version of their bigger relations the 22-foot and 24-foot half-deckers and open boats . These were the boats for the working class , the tradesmen of the foreshores . Their lifestyle afforded few luxuries , they were both proud and hardened to their manual tasks , and they shared many common bonds that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and as a social group . The skiffs reflected this , simple but robust craft , crewed by sailors already bonded by their background , working as a team . It was also an escape from the routine ; over-rigged with a vast sail area , sailed on the edge with fierce rivalry , the skiffs were a weekly adventure that must have satisfied a desire to break away from the mundane weekly chores . <p> Walter Reeks , an English naval architect and yachtsman who settled in Sydney in 1885 aged 24 , very quickly established himself at home with a strong allegiance to his new country and to Sydney Harbour . Writing in 1888 for the Illustrated Sydney News on Yachting and Sailing under the title ' Small Craft ' , his enthusiasm is unmistakable : <p> " Turning now from the majestic and graceful yacht to the slippery , quick motioned , excitement giving half deckers and open boats , we find them legion . They are a wonderful class of boats , and despite their faults we have reason to be proud of the boats themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are the means of imparting to those who sail them , in the second Quickness of eye , agility of body , and strength of nerve , are necessary in the highest degree ; and probably in no other community are those essentials to be good sailors more fully developed than amongst the small boat fraternity of Sydney harbour . Some of the rivers with heavy tides and short choppy seas in England and the very broad skimming dishes in America , go far to produce the hanging out ' into her ' style of sailing ; but in Sydney boys do as much sailing of that kind in a month as is done in other places in a year . <p> The spectator sees something coming which impresses him that a five-tonners sails have got adrift and taken a jaunt on their own account , for as the thing approaches naught but sails and spars are visible , but when it is abreast of him , he beholds a boat just big enough to seat and float her crew , with a boom twice as long as herself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same and mast as if all spars were added together ( such is the first impression ) tearing up the foam and water It is gone , but ' it passed so swift , scarce the eye could say that such a thing had been ' and he breathes again , and after ascertaining that he was awake and sober , realises that it was a real boat and there are times even with them when a very good idea of having been born a bird can be obtained " <p> Clearly the excitement and wonder of the craft was something to behold , and Reeks was not alone in this observation . In 1891 the successful Sydney businessman and entrepreneur Mark Foy was one of a group of people who established the Sydney Flying Squadron for racing on the Harbour . The club was established for working class sailors sailing in open boats whose proportions and build still had close connections to their working craft origins . It was a complete contrast to the elite yacht clubs with their fine vessels , sailing uniforms and gentlemanly ways . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ driving force behind the club in the early years . He was confident and brash , with a plan to create a spectacle for the public and sailors . He offered prize money as an enticement for the sailors , and planned the races so that they could be easily followed from the harbour shore , especially prime vantage points such as Bradley 's Head . The craft had bold insignias on their sails visible to those onshore , and they started in a handicap procession to remove any time corrections at the finish , sailing a set triangular course . Anyone could tell what was happening and who was winning ; it was the boat in front . <p> The SFS established a simple rule ; to race with the club the boat could not be longer than 18 feet . At that length a simple , robust and affordable craft could be built , but that humble concept was spiced with the same oversized sail plan as seen on the bigger 22s and 24s . You had to be game to sail one . To support the large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ballast . Only a small foredeck and narrow side decks were accepted , creating a boat with virtually no margin for error , guaranteeing exciting sailing for the crew and spectators . <p> The reckless nature of the sailing captured sailors into the class and lured crowds to the shoreline , the regular Saturday 18-foot skiff races were a premier sporting event throughout the summer . Detailed reports were run in the daily media . It was followed on the water by a small fleet of chartered ferries , and immediately latched onto by the bookmakers , it did n't matter that gambling was illegal . This fuelled an already emotionally charged event with the tantalising prospect of a nice return on a small outlay , the spectators became punters and the gambling addiction ensured many would be back each week . <p> Even in these early days the skiffs did not go unnoticed out side of Australia . Dixon Kemp 's ' Manual of Yacht and Boat Sailing ' ( 1895 edition ) carries a short piece on the ' Sydney Boats , ' reporting on the open boats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tone of the piece written from an English perspective hovers between respect , admiration then alarm and disapproval . <p> " the universal system of measurement is length overall The consequence is that a boat has developed which has great beam , little depth , immense sails and a large centreboard . Great numbers as crews are carried , the whole of whom sit up to windward , holding onto life-lines , and hang flat out over the water on the gunwale sills . They habitually sail their boats with the lee gunwale 2 or 3 inches underwater the skipper knows to a fraction of an inch how far his boat can heel before a luff becomes necessarylength for length there are no boats afloat which will hold these Sydney ' flat irons ' in a light day . In running and reaching kites of every description are carriedOf course , capsizes , especially in gybing are very frequent.the writer has seen four 24 footers go ' into the ditch ' one after the other in gybing round a particularly bad headland . <p> The objections to these skimming dishes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a Clyde 23 ft would do what she liked with them .. it is difficult to get a dozen or fifteen crews no bulb keel idea seems to have caught on and under the Sydney handicap system the boats at the end of the race are generally packed together within a few hundred yards , and bad luck will affect all equally . Probably this system will never be popular here . " <p> That 's one view , but then on the other hand the now well known solo sailor Captain Joshua Slocum had visited Sydney in 1896 and he liked what he saw : In his book he recalls : <p> " the typical Sydney boat is a handy sloop of great beam and enormous sail-carrying power , but a capsize is not uncommon for they carry sail like Vikings . " <p> The analogy to the spirited and feared Vikings is appropriate . The racing was tough and gave rise to many stories of larrikin behaviour that parallel the Australian character developed by the European colonisers whose arrival in Sydney was barely 100 years beforehand . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resilience , ingenuity and eventual understanding of the environment , and it hardened them to their life , forging a mixture mateship , loyalty and rivalry . The skiff sailors were the same . Loyal to each other , ready to sail in any conditions with different rigs to suit the conditions , aware from experience what the weather might do , and determined to sail as hard as they could . <p> Life as a crew was tough ; bare hands and raw strength in uncomfortable conditions , crammed together with no space and now where to hide . The bailer boy had the worst of it ; his initiation into the sport was spent in the bilge under the feet of his burly crew , trampled , abused and yelled at no matter what . If the breeze went light , sometimes crew were ordered overboard to swim ashore or wait on one of the islands or channel pile markers to be picked up later . Fights were said to be common place between crew and even within boats as tempers flared in tight situations . In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to BRITANNIA , so BRITANNIA 's crew tried to press ARLINE 's boom underwater . ARLINE 's crew of police and slaughterhouse workers retaliated , and one of the meatworkers started out along the boom with a knife in his mouth . BRITANNIA 's crew then knocked him out by hurling a stone demijohn at him and ARLINE broke off the fight . <p> The established pattern of racing and the class remained virtually unchanged for almost four decades , despite the fact that the rules if they could be called that had few restrictions . The half decked boats remained wide and deep with solid cedar planked hulls , thwarts , a tabernacle , lee cloths , and a steel plate centreboard . They were pushed to the limit . The upwind sailplan was gaff rigged main , jib and tops'l , but downwind this was then overshadowed by a huge spinnaker set on a pole that was assembled in three sections , a ringtail hung off the leech of the main , perhaps a watersail pulled out under the boom and even a balloon jib . The hull @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tensioned with iron rigging , all trimmed by manpower in a place where caution was often considered an anchor . <p> The 18 footers also took hold in Brisbane where they became well established on the Brisbane River , and to Western Australia for a brief period where they raced on the Swan River . Perth even held the Australian Championships in 1925 in a bid to promote the class in that state . <p> Nothing very significant happened to upset the status quo , the class sailed on through the early decades of the 20th century creating legends out of skippers such as Wee ' Georgie ' Robinson and BRITANNIA , Chris Webb and AUSTRALIA , Peter Cowie and SCOT , Billy Fisher and his many AUSTRALIAs , Billy Dunn and KISMET . A couple of skippers tried a snub bow such as seen on Norm Blackman 's YENDYS , but change was very gradual . <p> At the beginning of the 1930s change began to happen more quickly . Charlie Hayes built ARRAWATTA not only with a snub bow , but it had a new Marconi rig and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It won the Australian Championships in 1931 . Soon after came the first big upset , and it was the beginning of a long period of controversy involving politics off the water . <p> In 1933 the Queenslanders launched ABERDARE . Built by Alf Whereat it had only seven feet beam and seven crew and could plane downwind easily . The skiff was virtually unbeatable , winning the Australian Championships on the Brisbane River for the 1933/34 season . It won again in Sydney in the following season , and over five seasons won the championship four times . In 1936 during a gale it was timed at 23 knots during a -+ mile run on Brisbane River . Most Sydney crews were horrified at this radical change in proportions , and the traditional skiff sailors condemned it as a freak . They felt ABERDARE and its sisters would destroy the sight of the wide 18s with huge sail plans and their big crews . <p> However Sydney skipper Bob Cuneo saw things differently and commissioned a similar hull for the next season , which he called THE MISTAKE , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ban the boat unless it sailed with at least 10 crew members . In 1935 they went a step further banning boats with a beam of 7 feet or less and withdrew from interstate racing . <p> This caused a split amongst sailors and club officials in Sydney and Brisbane , The SFS and Brisbane 18 Footer Squadron placed restrictions on the dimensions to try and retain the traditional type , but the Brisbane 18 Foot Sailing Club and newly formed NSW 18 Foot Sailing League fostered the new or modern type . <p> In a sense history then repeated itself ; once again a confident and strong personalty took a lead role in establishing a new way of doing things . The clubs founder and first president was sporting promoter JJ Giltinan , a former member of the SFS and the man who had begun the breakaway Rugby League code early in the 1900s . The League raced on Sundays , and forged ahead to secure the higher ground by creating a World Championship event between skiffs raced in Sydney , Queensland and WA , and similar 18 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was first won by TAREE sailed by Bert Swinbourne and built in Brisbane by Norman Wright . <p> Crowds still flocked to watch the 18s on both days , and the League enticed some of the SFS boats to race on Sundays with special , handicaps . The rift between the two clubs was enormous and took decades before it was considered healed . For many years the SFS tried to maintain the old traditions more or less alone , leaving the League to continue down a new path . <p> Despite the onshore club arguments it was still a spectacle for the public and the crews , described with some awe in the American magazine Rudder September 1938 in a report written by visiting American cruising yachtsmen Ray Kauffman and Gerry Mefferd . <p> ' On Sundays , before a floating gallery of nearly 10,000 spectators , the famous 18-footers race . Countless small craft line the course and half a dozen big ferries , crowded and complete with book-makers , worry along among them . It is an exciting race and the skippers , eager to press their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sail . And it is this craze for sail that makes this sport so exciting and the outcome of the race uncertain right up to the final gun . In too many cases the leading boat , driven to the limit , has caught a sudden gust of wind and capsized . <p> One of the most vivid glimpses we had of the eighten-footers was from the speedboat of a news cameraman who braved the profanity of the crews and darted right alongside the boats for close-up action shots . At the more exciting moments of the race , it was fascinating to see the well trained crews handle , in the confined space of an eighteen foot open boat , enough gear to sail a full blown ship . ' <p> Development continued until racing was halted during World War II , but picked up again after the war . The boats became narrower and ended up at six feet beam . Moulded construction was introduced and gradually more modern materials were adopted for rigging , sheets and sails . Crew began to use trapezes to stand out from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a step ahead of the traditional 1920s style , they were still large and relatively heavy compared to new lightweight dinghy designs from Europe . This international influence was to create the next major upset . <p> In 1959 Bob Miller and his crew , Norman Wright III and Jack Hamilton built TAIPAN to Bob 's design , it was perhaps the most revolutionary craft in the class history . This Queensland craft was very lightweight , built in plywood , had a single chine hull shape , only three crew , and an overlapping genoa . It could plane upwind which was a major breakthrough , and it bore no resemblance to the typical skiff of the period . Although it failed to win the World Championships due to gear failure and other errors , it was clearly the fastest craft and pointed to a new direction forward . <p> Once again the change was resisted strongly in NSW , but there were also a large number who could see the advantages of the cheaper and lighter craft , and started to build boats of this type . Reversing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the new three handed type , but even then not all members supported this move . <p> TAIPAN was followed by Miller 's design VENOM , which won the 1961 World Championship series , and although Miller 's pair of boats pointed clearly where the class should go , many clubs had difficulty in accepting such huge changes in one go . The class became fractured with the NSW clubs having different rules and restrictions which allowed some of the new features but not all at once . Many boats had four or five hands but were considerably lighter , many boats raced with SFS on Sunday and then carried more crew to race with the League on Sunday . <p> From the 1950s onwards sponsors began to help with some support for the craft and had their logo on the sail as the emblem . The 1960s became a period of significant change that was partially restrained by the arguments between and within clubs . <p> In the 1970s where there was a rapid development of hulls and rigs . New Zealander Bruce Farr was one of the principle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lighter and faster . Three crew became universally accepted , and the craft began to get wider with small wings at the gunwale to give the crew greater leverage . Some buoyancy was permitted , but to retain some respect for tradition if you capsized and the mast touched the water you were disqualified . TRAVLODGE sailed by Bob Holmes and then Dave Porter 's KB were dominant craft during this period , which also showed the trend to stronger sponsor support . The clubs were more or less reconciled and sailed to the same rules , but the move away from the working class background which probably began in the 1960s was now well and truly exposed , and the class was at the beginning of a period when the sheer excitement of the sailing was largely supporting its existence its development aspect was controling the class direction . <p> By the end of the decade Iain Murray had adopted space-age lightweight , composite materials after one season in a plywood craft , and his almost total dominance with the COLOR 7 series of craft shifted construction to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ professional sailing approach to the class , and as the 18-foot skiffs moved into the 1980s the boat had become a major campaign and was expensive to own and sail . Significant sponsorship was a prime requirement to maintain a position at the front of the fleet with an up-to-date competitive craft . COLOR 7 was joined by LYSAGHT COLORBOND , WRIGLEYS PK GUM , CHESTY BOND , PRUDENTIAL INSURNACE , STUBBIES and other well known brands . They had their name on a sail and it was matched with a significant outlay to support the design , construction and a seasons sailing for a craft carrying three complete rigs , a custom trailer and even a paid hand to work on it during the week . Last year 's boat reappeared in a new guise for someone with much more limited funds , but this year 's boat was always better so the race was already partially won if you secured a good sponsor . <p> The technical change that pushed things to a new extreme was the introduction of aluminium and mesh wings beyond the gunwale extensions . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again sailing ) surprised the fleet with a set of wing extensions . Although fast , he could not quite catch COLOR 7 . However the idea was quickly copied and immediately bettered , width grew rapidly until the boats were as wide as they were long . Rigs got bigger as well , speed was hitting new heights and they just looked unbelievable compared to anything else . The final refinement was a fixed spinnaker pole on the centreline with an asymmetric spinnaker , making the boat easier to gybe . Width grew again until craft had reached 26 feet from wing to wing . Julian Bethwaite had done his numbers and for three seasons he raced PRIME COMPUTERS , a successful two handed skiff . It was a giant 12 footer in some ways , but although good in light to moderate conditions , the power of three crew kept the three-handers on top . <p> Things boiled over in the second half of the 1980s , sponsorship ran dry and the class was in crisis . The fleet soldered on without any new craft for a season @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bill McCartney from the NSW League organised a package for sponsorships , events and media rights . In the 1990s his Grand Prix sailing was a modern Mark Foy enterprise and saw the craft organised to race in locations around Australia and even overseas , and it was filmed for TV . The teams were not just Australian , there were sailors from the US , New Zealand and the UK . To try and rein in costs the class adopted a reduced sailplan , reduced beam , introduced a number of maximum and minimum dimensions and basically became a one design class only allowing hulls to be built from one particular mould . <p> The focus was now the NSW League club , the SFS survived with a fleet of older craft and at the end of the decade had established a another parallel fleet of replica 18s which campaigned a mixed fleet of boats based on designs from the 1920s tup to the 1950s . <p> In 2009 this situation had stabilized with a core of modern 18s racing from the NSW Leagues club using one design hulls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . On Saturdays the SFS sails a smaller fleet of modern 18s and growing fleet of replica 's such as BRITTANNIA , YENDYS , ABEDARE , ALRUTH and others . One tradition remains in place , albeit on a much smaller scale , a ferry from the Rosman Fleet is chartered each weekend for spectators . <p> It is no longer the pride of the working class , but the 18-foot skiff is still seen as an icon of Sydney Harbour and retains its place as one of the most challenging and fastest dinghy designs racing anywhere in the world .

The final version is dated 1928 and this is an historic yachting document The rule was created around the proportions and structure of two yachts designed by one of the nation 's first Australian born yacht designers Charlie Peel These two yachts connect the class to the Victorian workboats of Port Phillip and Bass Strait through the class 's construction scantlings , which also share characteristics of the famous Couta Boats The class is one of the longest surviving yacht classes in Australia , and probably the longest surviving class @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were associated with the class as designers , builders , crew and owners The states were very supportive of the class , with Tasmania , Qld , NSW and Victoria all designing and building a number of their own craft as true state representatives The class racing was significant because of the fierce competition it generated between the states during The Forster Cup series <p> History : <p> The class was created around two sister ships called NAMOI and IDLER . They were launched in 1909 and designed by Charlie Peel , IDLER was the first and its success led quickly to NAMOI being built as well .. The half-decked yachts were gaff rigged and 6.4 m ( 21 ft ) on the waterline . Both shared all the characteristics of another class called 24 foot square-sterners that raced on Port Phillip at this time . Thses boats had been designed and built by John McKenzie , srating with IMOGEN at 26 fett length , then DOREEN and THETIS , all in the early 1900s .

The maximum waterline length was 21 feet , which gave the class its eventual name . Other values were put on length overall , beam , draft , freeboard , transom rake and ballast . The restrictions also included a girth difference taken at the midsection which to some extent put a control on the hull shape and avoided any ' skimming dish ' designs that had caused problems in other classes and rules . <p> The outbreak of World War I in 1914 stopped any immediate progress for the class , but shortly after the end of the war three new craft were built to the rule in Victoria .

It was then called the 21ft ' Restricted ' Class and rules were published in the October issue of ' Australian Coal , Shipping , Steel and the Harbour ' . <p> The well known yachtsman Frank Albert provided the spark to begin the new class in NSW by announcing he would build a boat . A simple reference from ' Australian Coal , Shipping , Steel and the Harbour ' December 1920 at the very bottom of page 45 marks the beginning of the class as national entity . <p> ' Mr Frank Albert signified his intention of building to the new class , and there are several others who are contemplating building , but have not yet definitely stated their intentions .

They were called BOOMERANG , E.O.J. and CORELLA and launched late in 1921 .

The only other state to take up this first challenge was Queensland , with their new boats LAKATOI and MAROONBAH . <p> The three-race series was a huge success with some of the most exciting racing seen on the Harbour . Media interest was very strong and the regatta was watched by many spectators on the harbour foreshores , on private craft or aboard ferries . <p> Headlines for the second race were full of praise for the racing , as shown by this report from the Sydney Morning Herald , February 10th 1922 . <p> ' GREAT RACE .

The protest relating to a crew member 's alleged professional status was reversed after the intervention of Lord Forster in discussion with the other crews . GUMLEAF then borrowed a bigger sail for the following day to win the last heat and series , but while questions were raised as to whether this sail change contravened the official measurement of the boat , no protest was lodged . <p> The following week MAROONBAH won the Albert Cup , after CHERRYTOO had crossed the line first but was disqualified @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Frank Albert as a single race event to be held at the same time as The Forster Cup . <p> From that start The Forster Cup and Albert Cup became the most intensely fought events for interstate yacht racing up to World War II .

The Tasmanians became the dominant state with their three boats TASSIE , TASSIE II and TASSIE III taking The Forster Cup at sixteen of the regattas . Queensland was the unlucky state with only one win and many second placings . <p> Over 70 craft were built , showcasing the talents of designers and builders such as Charlie Peel , Walter Reeks , ' Skipper ' Batt , the Hayes family , the Savage Brothers , Whearet , Norman Wright , even William Fife from Scotland and Charles Nicholson for the UK .

In this way the craft were owned by a club or well known identity , but actually crewed and skippered by the best available sailors from the state . The class supported and encouraged many talented sailors who otherwise could not afford to own a yacht of this type . This happened in all of the states and was vital to the class being able to continue through the Depression , and a principal reason why it fostered skippers and crews who otherwise would not have gained the yacht racing experience the class provided . <p> Late in the 1940s after World War II the racing resumed , but only a handful of the fleet joined in the series , and only a couple of new craft were built .

The original IDLER has fallen on hard times . It is in the care of Seaworks in Williamstown , who have taken it under cover and are considering how best to stabilize and perhaps restore what remains of this famous craft .

Changes to the Deed of Gift can only be made by agreement between the major clubs in each state , and if more than one club or state objects , the change can not be made . <p> There were two other significant interstate trophies also in existence at the time , the Sayonara Cup and Northcote Cup . Both had a different format using match races between two or three yachts only . The Sayonara Cup had handicaps applied to the finishing times to determine the winner for some of the events , but it was open to Australian designed and built yachts .

@@77262601 @5962601/ <h> Hammond Craft <p> Hammond Craft were builders of some of the finest clinker ski boats or speed boats in Australia in the 1950s and 1960s . Shipwright Harry Hammond worked from a factory in Brookvale NSW for most of this period , and dedicated his company to building custom designs for individual clients ; his craft were always made to order . <p> Harry Hammond began boatbuilding with his brother Jim at the end of World War II . One of their ski boats was called ZOOMA . When Jim moved north to Ballina to build trawlers , Harry set up his own business in Ada Avenue at Brookvale . He had a small workforce with one or two employees and did not have a production line of craft under construction ; each craft was built to completion before the next one started . He always had a waiting list , but his craft were of the highest quality so customers were prepared to wait their turn . <p> Hammond Craft were primarily known for their clinker or lapstrake ski boats . The type was very popular around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in NSW for a share of the market . In Hammond 's case his clients usually wanted a show piece craft for recreational use but some were raced successfully . His clients included two of the O'Neill brothers from Sydney 's eastern suburbs , and Laurie O'Neill 's boat MISS AUSTRALIA from 1961 had to be bigger than SKI-BYE , built for Les O'Neill in 1954 . <p> Hammond designed and built the hull and the boats all followed a relatively similar pattern , but in most cases he would ask the client to source the engine , specify furnishings and provide other small items if required . They were generally 4.6 to 5.2 metres long and powered by flathead Fords and then V8s . He was influenced by features on some of the overseas powercraft such as the American Chris Craft or Italian Riva designs . The hulls were initially planked in Queensland maple , but later craft in the 1960s used Bruynzeel marine grade plywood . Most craft had a dark deck edge or covering board which contrasted with the fore and aft planking effect achieved by scoring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scored line created simulated the appearance of the decks on a Riva craft . The clear finished topsides were usually contested with a red bottom . <p> Most craft had a centremount arrangement with the decking over the engine aft of the forward cockpit continuous from side to side . A few craft such as SKI-BYE had a ' walkabout ' arrangement with an access space either side of the engine . The boats were finished to the highest standard and owners maintained them accordingly . <p> Hammond also built a small number of motor cruisers or launches , but his clinker ski boats remain sought after objects by enthusiasts . Few records were kept and it is thought that he built around 150 wooden ski boats between 1948 and 1969 , and then about 160 fibreglass Hammonds up until 1984 . Harry Hammond passed away in 2007 aged 92 . <p> MISS AUSTRALIA was a special boat , around 5.64 metres long , with a proud history .

It continued in operation after the war until the mid 1950s . <p> Concrete Constructions Pty Ltd put in a proposal to the Naval Board to build 20 Fairmile craft from prefabricated parts , and the area chosen to site their works at Mortlake on the Parramatta River was a timber yard occupied by Allen Taylor and Company , just to the west of the still familiar Mortlake to Putney vehicular ferry . Negotiations to reach an agreed sale price were not successful and the Commonwealth Government then acquired the site using wartime emergency regulations . Adjacent land and jetties were leased from the Maritime Services Board of NSW and the entire area then leased to Concrete Constructions . <p> The site was occupied on 15 May 1942 and it was given the name Green @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 424 began in August 1942 , and it was commissioned in late January 1943 , almost five months later . <p> The yard consisted of a main building housing the various tradesmen and space needed to build and launch the wooden hulls , while adjacent to the wharf area were buildings and a large crane to do the engineering and machinery fitout while the craft were in the water . The main building contained a lofting floor , joinery workshop , timber storage to one side , an area for steaming timbers and six undercover slipways alongside each other . <p> The sheds and yard was set-up to run as a production line , the concept around which the English design for Fairmiles had been created . Many of the frames , bulkheads and other structural or joinery parts were designed to be made separately and off site in bulk , and then fitted to the hulls as they took shape . Groups of workers formed gangs that concentrated on one task only , moving along the slipways in succession doing their part on each hull . As one hull @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be started . The keel was laid and adzed into shape by four workers , who moved onto the next one , followed by the gang setting up the frames , then the next gang did the stringers , and so on through the process . <p> The arrangement for the Fairmiles was to build the first five craft from parts shipped out from Great Britain , originally to Singapore . However some of the vessels carrying these parts were sunk and only a portion of the material made it to Sydney . The missing items were then built onsite or at other factories , such as Ralph Symonds plywood firm who cut the bulkheads to shape before sending them down to Green Point to be finished off and readied for assembly . Eventually all the parts were made in this manner and a similar pattern was evolved for the GPVs . <p> This assembly line concept allowed the yard to operate with a small group of experienced shipwrights and marine tradesmen , overseeing a much larger group of other tradesmen from other fields and apprentices . Often the tradesmen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and mysteries of ship building . Other workers were apprenticed straight from school . In this way the 20 Fairmiles for the Australian forces were completed at Green Point , with the last one ML 812 being commissioned in December 1943 . Other Fairmiles were built for the US armed forces and known as Fast Supply Vessels . The GPVs were built once the Fairmile production run was completed . <p> The yard was run by Concrete Constructions manager Cecil Boden , a naval architect and graduate of Glasgow University . His small team of about eight shipwrights was divided up to head each gang as leading hands or foremen . The head shipwright was ' Darkie ' Griffin , a well known boatbuilder from the Spit in Sydney . According to his son Joe , Darkie was taken from his position at Garden Island to set up the workforce and given free rein to chose the best shipwrights he could find to head the teams .

They filled their time in various ways such as playing cards in the bilge of an uncompleted hull , and a two-up school was run off to the side . However Keith recalls the day the plain-clothes police raided the site to put an end to the gambling .

He commissioned UTIEKAH II as a yacht for him to take students from the school on voyages to test and build their character in a more extreme environment away from the relatively normal city life the students experienced at school . He would take the yacht and its youthful crew out into Bass Strait , a potentially dangerous area with its strong currents , tides , many islands and often rough weather , but the heavy displacement craft was designed and built to be suitable for the task .

Hayes ' yard was in Careening Cove , North Sydney .

The 9.14 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for racing and cruising , planked in New Zealand kauri on spotted gum frames and keel . The plumb stem and stern was a common feature for the period , and Hayes added their trademark low profile , rounded-front cabin house . With a moderate length bowsprit and transom hung rudder , HOANA 's hull and rig was a typical configuration that was developed from the Victorian couta boats . Mark Foy introduced the couta boat to Sydney Harbour as a racing yacht with success , and other owners followed his lead into the early 1900s , in particular Fred Lomar and Walter Dendy . The couta boat shape influenced builders such as Hayes , Golding , and CAM Fisher in the subsequent construction of small yachts for the harbour . <p> This created a simple yacht built for racing and cruising on Sydney Harbour , a type called the auxiliary coach house cruiser .

The moulds were respaced so that it was 600 mm longer , and it too was called HOANA . This has led to much confusion , as the new and longer HOANA then raced with SASC and remained on the Harbour until 1947 . In the meantime the original HOANA was cruised by Frank Hayes and his family and it is understood HOANA may have been changed to a Bermudan cutter rig during this period .

This technique was the main interpretive form in the Australian Service Nurses National Memorial in Canberra ACT , a public commission with Robin Moorhouse from 1999 . <p> Langley gradually realised that water possessed many of the same qualities as glass . It could do the same thing as glass but in much larger scale . He began working with water and light , setting up large-scale light installations around Sydney Harbour at night with fibreoptic cable .

@@77262639 @5962639/ <p> THE STING is a wooden three-point hydroplane built in Goolwa South Australia in 1972 for powerboat racing . THE STING is one of very few remaining plywood unlimited three-pointers still able to be operated in Australia , and is demonstrated regularly in SA where it has always been well known , and is still driven by its original driver and co-builder Dig Traeger . The design was based on Ernie Nunn 's 1963 , 1965 and 1968 Griffith Cup winning boat WASP TOO . THE STING has won numerous events in South Australia and remains the holder of two outright speed records for the state . The boat was re-engined as part of its racing career , and it remains in this final configuration , in excellent condition . <p> DescriptionTHE STING was built in Goolwa by boatbuilder and carpenter Jack Newcombe working with Dig Traeger . Traeger was a competitor and colleague of the champion driver Ernie Nunn , one of the sport 's most celebrated and popular drivers who began racing as a teenager in 1916 and carried on to the 1970s . In the early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visit . According to Traeger : " we were having a cup of tea , and Ernie said I should get out of the skiffs Traeger 's current class before it killed me and get into hydroplanes " . On the promise that he only built one boat , Nunn offered Traeger permission to copy WASP TOO , his previous winner of the Australasian Championship Griffith Cup , the premier powerboat race in Australia and New Zealand . Nunn had built this boat by adapting a smaller design from American designer Ted Jones . Traeger and Newcombe went to Sydney and measured up WASP TOO , then returned to Goolwa where THE STING was built in a Nissan hut . The maple plywood hull is framed with plywood bulkheads and has Oregon stringers and stiffeners . <p> It was an excellent project according to Traeger ; THE STING was right from the start and never needed any major revisions , a credit to the original design and to their building skills . Using the original engine , a 350 cu.in . Chevrolet V8 Traeger set a state record of 112 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ class . He sold the boat in 1976 to Les Schrapel , and helped him install a larger 454 cu in V8 Chevrolet engine . With this engine it set an unlimited state record of 124 mph ( 198 kph ) . These records still stand in 2011 , lasting almost 35 years . It has a fibreglass cockpit arrangement , with a vertical steering wheel . This allows the cables to be run directly from the axle along the floor to the rudder , a safer arrangement than leading them off to the side and then aft . <p> The transom mounted rudder is offset from the centreline to the port side , so that the thrust from the propeller is not disturbed by the rudder , which would reduce the effectiveness of the thrust . This offset rudder position also suits turning to port , because the races are all setup with the turns made only to port . This is because the torque from the spinning propeller is so strong that the craft can turn comfortably in only one direction , and can not turn against the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to port , and all engines and propellers are then configured to suit this . The engine is fuelled by avgas petrol . <p> Traeger acquired THE STING again in 2006 . He had retired from racing but maintained the hydroplane in operating condition . Amongst the demonstrations Traeger still does with THE STING is his regular feature at the Goolwa Wooden Boat Festival where the river front is closed down for 20 minutes each morning to give THE STING uninterrupted passage . Traeger then performs a series of runs at over 100mph , close to the wharf , with a tight turn to port at each end , demonstrating both the speed and the agility of these finely tuned craft , along with the thunderous roar of the powerful engine . It is then brought down on its trailer to the main display area so people can view the well built wooden craft .

@@77262640 @5962640/ <h> Maritime Archaeology Comes To Bunbury <h> The Boat in the Beach <h> Desktop surveys and carpark shipwrecks <p> In 1982 , the Western Australian Museum was contracted by Western Australia 's State Energy Commission to conduct a survey for historic shipwrecks in Koombana Bay . Utilising a combination of archival sources , oral histories and prior archaeological research , maritime archaeologist Dr Michael McCarthy identified the approximate locations of wreck sites within the bay 's environs , including those of Samuel Wright and both whaleships named North America . McCarthy learned that the land covering the wreck sites of the American whalers was used variously as a caravan park , miniature golf course and carpark in the wake of sand-mining activities . He also discovered that at least three other large sailing vessels " the brig Annie M Young- ( 1876 ) and barques Midas- ( 1872 ) and Cingalee - ( 1887 ) " came to grief in approximately the same area . <p> The results of McCarthy 's survey provided impetus for another maritime archaeology project at Koombana Bay nearly three decades later .

Based on their size and other characteristics , both sections were thought to originate from either Midas or Solglyt , an 875-ton Norwegian barque wrecked at Koombana Bay in 1901 . The excavation also resulted in discovery of the well-preserved bow section of a wrecked wooden vessel , but it unfortunately did not turn out to be one of the American whalers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and other data strongly indicate the wrecked hull is either that of Annie M Young or Cingalee . <p> The Wollaston map overlaid on satellite imagery of Bunbury , showing Samuel Wright 's projected site location .

Between 8 and 16 February 2016 , a research team led by Ross Anderson of the Western Australian Museum excavated a wooden shipwreck located within Samuel Wright 's projected loss area . The team comprised maritime archaeologists and conservators affiliated with the Western Australian Museum , as well as several archaeology students from the University of Western Australia and Notre Dame University .

The distance between these two structural features would help establish the overall length of the hull , while specifics of their construction could potentially reveal when and where the ship was built . <p> It soon became apparent the line of frames exhibited a curve , which suggested the hull was narrowing towards one end . One excavation team followed this line and expanded deeper into the shipwreck to determine the vertical extent of the hull , while the other uncovered additional frames in the projected midships section and discovered remnants of several stanchions . These vertical timbers served as deck beam supports and were installed at intervals along the vessel 's centreline . Their relative positions enabled the team to accurately predict where the opposite side of the hull would emerge , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and identified as the bow . <p> Although an extensive dewatering system was installed around the site to lower the normal groundwater level ( approximately 1.5 metres below the modern land surface ) and facilitate excavation , only a relatively small percentage of the bow could be uncovered and documented due to its depth . Encroaching groundwater created similar difficulties for any excavated area within the site that exceeded six metres . For this reason , the mainmast step " located within the lowest part of the hull at depths well beyond the limits of the dewatering system " could not be accessed . However , an approximate location for the mast step emerged with discovery of remnants of the ship 's bilge pump well . Water tends to collect in a sailing ship 's hull adjacent to and below the base of the mainmast , and one or more pump wells were constructed around this area to trap the bilge 's contents so they could be expelled through the pumps . <p> Structural components identified in the forward part of the wreck include the stem-post , a large curved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formed the very end of the bow . It served as the primary junction between hull planking on the bow 's port and starboard sides , and was one element of a much larger assembly of timbers . For example , attached to the forward end of the stem-post is the cutwater , a nearly identical ( but smaller ) vertical timber that literally cut through the water while the ship was under way . The front edge of the cutwater is shrouded in a sheet of lead that was formed around it and tacked in place . This shoe ' was intended to absorb or deflect damage to the cutwater caused by floating obstructions , accidental grounding or prolonged exposure to the sea . Also attached to the stem-post 's port side was a copper-alloy number 8 ' , later recovered for analysis and interpretation . One of the ship 's waterline markers , it indicated approximately eight feet ( 2.4 metres ) of preserved hull was buried beneath it . Encroaching groundwater proved particularly troublesome in this area , however , and precluded further excavation . <p> Preliminary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with relatively large frames spaced at close intervals in a largely consistent pattern of assembly . Similarly , the ceiling and hull planking are robust and typical of a large , oceangoing sailing vessel . An array of fasteners , including copper-alloy spikes , iron bolts and wooden treenails , was used to assemble the ship 's many architectural components . Copper sheathing and an underlying layer of sacrificial wooden planking hewn from yellow pine were found in the bow , and point to efforts by the vessel 's owners and operators to inhibit damage to its hull by marine borers such as the shipworm ( Teredo navalis ) and gribble ( Limnoria lignorum ) . <p> A number of repairs were noted , including what appears to be either a partial or complete replacement of one of the vessel 's breast-hooks . These large V-shaped timbers were installed laterally across a ship 's stem to unite and strengthen the internal bow structure , and two examples were noted on the wreck site . One was intentionally hewn from white oak and is an original element of the ship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ limb of the same approximate shape and size that was clearly derived from a different wood species . In terms of overall appearance the replacement timber resembles a variety of eucalyptus , which suggests it may have been sourced within Australia . <p> The site contains a variety of artefacts , including items associated with the ship 's provisioning and operation , and examples of the crew 's personal effects . Shipboard victuals are represented by animal bones , several of which bear evidence of butchering . Fragments of broken bottle glass and clay smoking pipes indicate some crewmen had a preference for alcohol and tobacco , while a small handful of leather shoes reveal the type(s) of footwear available to them . A small scatter of unused bricks in the bow may have been spares for the vessel 's tryworks , a brick furnace located immediately aft of the foremast that held two large iron cauldrons ( trypots ) where whale blubber was heated and rendered into oil . Two small partial wooden casks were discovered in association with the bricks , and at least one of them " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to store salted meat . Larger barrels discovered in the midships section may also have been used to store provisions , but likely contained whale oil or water . Artefacts with high diagnostic or interpretive value were carefully recovered , documented in the field and transported to the Western Australian Museum 's conservation laboratory , where they will undergo stabilisation treatment and detailed analysis . All other artefacts were documented in situ and reburied at the end of the excavation . <p> A range of recording techniques , including baseline offset mapping , digital photography and videography , 3D photogrammetry and 3D laser scanning , were used to document the site . Three-dimensional mapping methods in particular created accurate and detailed digital renderings of the surviving hull and artefacts in a relatively brief span of time . Although slower , offset mapping was essential because it required each archaeological team to physically examine and measure the objects and features it was tasked with documenting . This in turn enabled archaeologists to identify and record specific details of the shipwreck " such as small hull repairs " that might otherwise have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the project , the exposed hull was covered with a protective layer of geotextile cloth and reburied . Recovery and display of the ship 's surviving hull " in whole or in part " was advised against because of the long-term commitment in time , money , personnel and facilities necessary to successfully treat and stabilise a saturated wooden object of its size and complexity . The site has now returned to a close approximation of the deoxygenated and waterlogged environment it existed within prior to excavation . These conditions are necessary for long-term stabilisation of hull timbers and other organic items , and the shipwreck " if left undisturbed " should be safely preserved for many years to come . <p> A mechanical excavator looms over Samuel Wright 's exposed bow section on the project 's final day . <p> Image : Pat Baker / Western Australian Museum <p> Based on its location , construction and associated artefact assemblage , as well as comparison of this information with an array of historical sources , researchers at the Western Australian Museum are now confident the shipwreck site is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surviving overall dimensions based on archaeological data indicates a length and breadth of 34 metres and 7.6 metres , respectively . This corresponds well to archival descriptions of Samuel Wright 's general specifications . In addition , recent qualitative X-ray fluorescence analysis of a sample of copper-alloy fastenings recovered from the shipwreck has revealed they were manufactured with a very high percentage of copper ( 98.15 - 1.07% ) . Fasteners of this type were common in North American shipbuilding until 1832 , when copper alloys with greater percentages of zinc and tin were introduced . While the site has now been identified , detailed analysis of archaeological data is ongoing , and plans are now underway to interpret and exhibit the project 's results for the public .

@@77262646 @5962646/ <p> POLLYANNA is an 18.29 metre ( 60 feet ) bridge-deck motor cruiser built by Lars Halvorsen Son 's yard in Ryde , Sydney just after World War II . It has spent most of its life in Perth , Fremantle and Rottnest Island in Western Australia where it was well known through its high profile owner , Roland Smith , who spent many years overseeing improvements in public access to Rottnest Island . <p> DescriptionPOLLYANNA was launched in late 1946 and called SYLPH V by its original owners , four brothers of the Lawson family from Sydney 's eastern suburbs .

In 1642 Tasman sighted new land that he called Van Diemen 's Land ( now Tasmania ) after the Governor-General of the East Indies , Anthony van Diemen . In 1644 he completed charting a long stretch of northern coast from the Gulf of Carpentaria to North West Cape , connecting all the unfolding Dutch discoveries to form HollandiaNova ( New Holland ) .

The Second World War was in its third year and Sydney , which had recently returned to Australia after serving with distinction in the Mediterranean Theatre , was tasked with escorting the troopship Zealandia to Indonesia 's Sunda Strait . Following an uneventful six-day passage , Sydney rendezvoused with the light cruiser HMS Durban , to which it transferred responsibility for Zealandia and the final leg of the troopship 's voyage to Singapore . As Sydney reversed course and began the return journey to Fremantle , those aboard Zealandia and Durban could not have known that they would be among the last people to see the warship then regarded as the pride of the Royal Australian Navy ' for another sixty-six years . <p> By mere chance , the two ships encountered one another on the afternoon of 19 November .

The vessel was purchased by the Australian government while still on the stocks and renamed prior to its launch on 22 September 1934 . Sydney was commissioned into the Royal Australian Navy ( RAN ) on 24 September 1935 and drew much of its complement from the cruiser HMAS Brisbane ( I ) , which decommissioned the same day . Upon completing month-long sea trials , Sydney departed for Australia , but was almost immediately reassigned to join the Royal Navy 's Mediterranean Fleet to participate in an economic blockade of Italy in response to the Abyssinian Crisis .

On 28 November 1939 , it joined the Australian heavy cruisers Australia ( II ) and Canberra ( I ) in an unsuccessful search of the Indian Ocean for the German pocket battleship Admiral Graf Spee . Sydney resumed home water patrols and escort duty until April 1940 , when it was assigned to the East Indies Station in Ceylon ( Sri Lanka ) .

In the latter part of World War II , sailors on Sydney Harbour formed the Cruising Yacht Club of Australia ( CYCA ) to promote cruising and casual races in lieu of those suspended during the previous war years . Their first official event was in October 1944 . During 1945 three of the members " Jack Earl , Peter Luke and Bert Walker " planned a cruise to Hobart in their respective yachts after Christmas . One evening Captain John Illingworth RN gave a talk to the club members , and afterwards Peter Luke suggested Illingworth might like to join the cruise . Illingworths reply was I will , if you make a race of it ' . <p> And so it was . The Sydney Morning Herald on 16 June 1945 noted that Plans for a race from Sydney to Hobart , early in January 1946 are being made by the Cruising Yacht Club five possible entries had already been received ' . <p> Later , in the Australian Power Boat and Yachting Monthly of 10 October 1945 , there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : It is expected that an Ocean Yacht Race may take place from Sydney to Hobart , probably starting on December 26 , 1945 .

The plans , expectations , the probables and possibles of earlier reports " they all turned into reality at the entrance to Sydney Harbour just inside North Head on Boxing Day in 1945 , when nine yachts set forth , including Illingworth in his recently purchased yacht Rani . Illingworth had previous experience of ocean racing from his homeland in England and in the USA , where he was a respected competitor , and he prepared Rani to race to Hobart , and not just sail there . The other sailors had a more relaxed attitude . <p> That first race encapsulated many features now associated with the event , and in hindsight was a warning of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fleet on the first day , and many were unprepared for the rough seas that scattered the fleet .

A local resident treated the ship 's company to a crayfish supper , which was the gastronomic highlight of the voyage ' . <p> Meanwhile the experienced Illingworth , who had prepared Rani and his crew well , had continued to race his yacht throughout .

In response to this , the CYCA established good safety precautions quite early on , which for many years it updated in line with the evolution of the participating craft . It often established precautions or limits not enforced in other events .

A strong southerly-flowing current was mixed with a south-west gale caused by an almost cyclonic depression travelling east across Bass Strait . This had developed soon after the race began and was predicted by many weather forecasters . Winds of more than 80 knots were recorded , but the opposing wind and current directions produced difficult seas with an unusual number of enormous waves which caused the most damage . Yachts were knocked down beyond 90 degrees , and some rolled completely . Numerous yachts were unable to withstand the continuous battering and were forced to heave to or otherwise adopt survival techniques before retiring with damage .

Perfect conditions with a northeast breeze have helped establish race records . In 1973 the reinforced cement-hulled Helsal " referred to by some as the floating footpath ' " caught people by surprise to set a record , but it did not last long . In 1975 , the world-beating maxi yacht Kialoa III came across from the USA , and owner Jim Kilroy steered it to a new record , well under three days .

A small number of boats have done the double ' and won both , including- Wild Oats XI in 2005 , which scored a treble with the race record as well . However quite often the trophy has gone to a well-sailed yacht towards the middle of the finishing order , and sometimes the changeable weather patterns favour the smaller yachts towards the tail end . The most notable handicap winner is the Halvorsen brothers ' Freya , which achieved the remarkable feat of winning three races in succession , from 1963 to 1965 . Love &amp; War has also won the race three times , in 1974 , 1978 and 2006 .

Some aspire to do it just once , while others come back year after year . The challenging conditions might appear to be the primary drawcard in many instances , but the attractions of blue-water sailing have seduced many competitors in the long run .

@@77262683 @5962683/ <h> A VOYAGE INTO CATASTROPHE <h> Pompeii and the Roman Navy <p> Collecting material for a history of the Roman Empire , the historian Tacitus sent a letter to Pliny the Younger asking for an account of the death of his famous uncle , the polymath Pliny the Elder , who had died some 25 years earlier in 79 AD . Pliny 's gripping reply is the only eyewitness account of the eruption of Mount Vesuvius , which devastated Campania , burying the towns of Pompeii , Herculaneum and Stabiae . It is also the only account of Pliny the Elder 's attempted rescue of civilians from the disaster using the ships of the Roman navy " an effort that cost him his life . <p> An unlikely hero , Pliny was 55 , overweight , asthmatic and a bookworm with a long list of published works to his name . His most famous work , his Natural History , still survives today . Published just before the eruption , it covers a huge range of natural history topics " astronomy , geography , zoology , botany , agriculture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " in 37 books . As he writes in his preface , the Natural History contains more than 20,000 facts mined from 100 authors , which he hoped would be a useful reference work for the masses , farmers and artisans . It is one of the few works to survive from antiquity , as it did indeed prove useful . <p> Mount Vesuvius from one of the Roman villas at Sorrento . Image : Matthew O'Sullivan . <p> Pliny was born in Como in northern Italy at the foot of the Alps , a region that had only fairly recently been given Roman citizenship . In his discussion on wool Pliny recounts that his father remembered wearing rough woollen topcoats , while he recalled coats shaggy inside and out , as well as shaggy woollen waist bands " clearly , they were not toga wearers . His family belonged to the equestrian class , just beneath the senatorial class in wealth and status . Pliny did his military service in the cavalry on the German frontier . There he served with Titus , who would follow his father Vespasian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Pliny did not seek any office under the flamboyant but murderous Nero . Only with the accession of Vespasian in 69 AD did Pliny take up public office , serving the new emperor as procurator in Roman provinces in France , Spain and North Africa . A procurator was a kind of chief financial officer of the province , there to assist the governor in financial matters but also to keep an eye on him for the emperor . When in Rome , Pliny served on Vespasian 's private advisory council , confirming he was in the inner circle of the new regime . <p> Pliny was responsible for the whole of the western Mediterranean and , most importantly , Rome <p> Around 76 AD he was appointed commander of the Roman naval base at Misenum on the Bay of Naples . This was the highest-paid and highest-ranking position outside Rome . The fleet had about 50 warships and 10,000 men , and was the largest military force in Italy , the legions being far away on the empire 's borders . Pliny was responsible for the whole of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the absence of any enemies the fleet 's role was to suppress piracy and provide speedy communications throughout the empire . <p> Misenum was some 250 kilometres from Rome " not particularly close , but the Bay of Naples provided the best harbours along the entire west coast of Italy . Rome 's port at Ostia , at the mouth of the Tiber , was too exposed to storms and flooding to be used as a naval base , nor was it a good commercial port ; 200 grain ships were destroyed in one storm there in 62 AD . With its two flooded volcanic craters Misenum proved ideal , providing an inner and outer harbour protected from winds and with beaches for careening ships . It could protect Rome 's main commercial port further along the Bay at Puteoli ( Pozzuoli ) . The famous grain fleet from Egypt that fed Rome docked there , as the ships were too large for Ostia . <p> Herculaneum , favoured for its sea breezes , was more of a resort , while Pompeii with its river port was more commercial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the east , highly convenient for the Roman elite who chose the Bay of Naples as their favoured holiday destination , attracted by its beauty and climate . The volcanic action that made the great harbours also made the volcanic springs . The spa resort of Baiae , next door to Misenum , was particularly popular . Nowhere had more plentiful or more healing water , according to Pliny . Food was another attraction " the fish and shellfish were unequalled , and the volcanic soils made the area the most fertile in Italy . <p> Next comes the well-known fertile region of Campania . In its hollows begin the vine bearing hills and the celebrated effects of the juice of the vine , famous the world over , and , as writers have said , the venue of the greatest competition between Bacchus and Ceres These shores are watered by hot springs and in no seas can the repute of their famous fish and shellfish be equalled . Nowhere is the olive-oil superior , another object of mankind 's pleasure. - Pliny the Elder , Natural History III @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pompeii and Herculaneum tapped into this network . Herculaneum , favoured for its sea breezes , was more of a resort , while Pompeii with its river port " which also served three towns further inland " was more commercial . Both were wealthy and connected to the capital and to the wider Mediterranean world due to their position on the bay and , thanks to Vesuvius , the fertility of their lands . <p> The streets of Pompeii , today . Image : S-F , via Shutterstock.com . <p> Pliny had no wife or children of his own , and at Misenum his widowed sister and her teenage son , Pliny the Younger , lived with him . Around 1 pm on 24 August 79 AD , his sister drew his attention to a cloud of unusual shape and size , resembling an umbrella pine , rising from a mountain in the distance ( later ascertained to be Vesuvius ) . Pliny 's interest piqued by what he thought was a relatively benign natural phenomenon , he ordered a Liburnian galley " one of the small , fast ships @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made ready to go and have a closer look . <p> He then received a message from his friend Rectina begging to be rescued . Her villa was at the foot of the mountain and the only escape was by sea ( how she got the message to Pliny is not explained ) . Realising that people 's lives were in danger , he ordered out the warships to save as many people as possible . <p> He changed his plans , and what he had begun in a spirit of inquiry he completed as a hero . He gave orders for the warships to be launched and went on board himself with the intention of bringing help to many more people besides Rectina , for this lovely stretch of coast was thickly populated. - Pliny the Younger , Letters VI 16 <p> The warships Pliny sent out were quadriremes , the largest ships in his fleet at 39 metres long and four metres wide . Each was powered by 232 oarsmen arranged in four banks called remes ( hence the name of the ship ) . Attached to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a rostrum , designed for ramming enemy ships to sink or disable them , the oarsmen providing the power . Oar power also made the ships highly manoeuvrable , ideal for the tricky situation into which they were going . Sails were used to get the ships to and from battle sites , and were most likely used to get the ships across the bay . The wind blowing from the north-west was in their favour . <p> Vesuvius was 28 kilometres away , and with an estimated speed of eight knots it would have taken the ships around three-and-a-half hours to get there . On the way Pliny was dictating , taking notes on each new movement and phase of the eruption . Hot ash started falling thickly on the ships , followed by pumice , around 5 pm as they neared the coast . Suddenly the water became shallow , caused by the seabed rising as Vesuvius ' magma chamber filled , and they were prevented from getting any closer to the shore by rafts of pumice . <p> Ashes were already falling , hotter and thicker as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and blackened stones , charred and cracked by the flames : then suddenly they were in shallow water , and the shore was blocked by the debris from the mountain . Pliny the Younger , Letters VI 16 <p> This indicates that they attempted to land somewhere south of Herculaneum , as that town had virtually no pumice fall during the entire eruption . This was due to the prevailing north-west wind blowing the ash and pumice south-east over Pompeii , where it had been falling since midday at a rate of about 15 centimetres an hour . As Pliny approached the coast , balconies and roofs in Pompeii were beginning to collapse from the weight . It would have been increasingly dangerous to stay indoors . Though there was little ash fall at Herculaneum , the ominous 30-kilometre-high volcanic cloud would have cast the town into darkness and the constant tremors would have encouraged people to flee or seek shelter in stronger buildings , like the arched superstructure of the Suburban Baths where most of Herculaneum 's victims were found . <p> The decision to run or stay during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He ordered his ship south past Pompeii to Stabiae , to the villa of his friend Pomponianus . On arrival he found Pomponianus wisely trying to leave , having loaded his belongings onto a ship , although he was unable to depart due to the contrary wind . Pliny had made a miscalculation ; having landed , he too was unable to leave for the same reason . He stayed in his friend 's villa . During the night more pumice fell , the level rising so high there was danger of Pliny being stuck inside his bedroom . He joined the others and they debated whether to stay indoors or take their chance in the open , as the buildings were now shaking violently . It was a debate that would have been happening throughout Pompeii as well . Choosing to stay outdoors , they tied pillows to their heads to protect themselves from falling debris . <p> The ruins of Pompeii . Image : S-F , via Shutterstock.com . <p> The decision to run or stay during this period was fateful . The deadly phase of the eruption @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Around 1 am the first pyroclastic surge of superheated gas and ash travelling at 30 metres per second smashed into Herculaneum , instantly killing everyone still there . At 400 " 450 degrees Celsius it carbonised wood , leather and foodstuffs and burned the flesh off living people . Further flows buried the town and extended the coastline 400 metres to the west . <p> The first surge and the next two did not reach Pompeii . When the fourth surge swept over Pompeii just after dawn , at 6.30 am , it killed everyone still present . Many were found trying to make their escape over the pumice fall . This surge was not as hot " it did not burn the bodies but rather formed a hard shell around them , creating a void once the bodies decomposed . It is from these voids that the famous Pompeiian body casts were made . Before the pyroclastic flow , deaths in Pompeii would have been from building collapse , and these bodies did not form casts as they were buried in loose pumice and ash . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , caused panic in Stabiae , 14 kilometres from the crater . Flames and the smell of sulphur gave warning of the approaching surge . Pliny tried to flee with the others , but the fumes and ash caused too much stress on his lungs and heart and he collapsed and died . His body was found two days later . Due to Stabiae 's distance from Vesuvius , and possibly the intervening Sarno river , the surge that reached Stabiae had cooled , so was n't fatal to all those present . <p> To date , 1,500 bodies have been found at Pompeii , and 350 at Herculaneum " about 10 per cent of their estimated populations <p> Whether or not the ships sent out by Pliny the Elder saved anyone is not clear from his nephew 's account , but then its main focus was not the rescue but his uncle , of whom he was genuinely fond . Pliny the Younger does make it clear that people were leaving the area as his uncle went in , and people in both towns had plenty of time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though this would have been increasingly difficult with the constant rain and build-up of pumice , and the complete darkness .

More victims may be found along the roads leading out of the towns or in their still-undiscovered ports , but it is likely most people escaped . <p> The ash cloud was so great it darkened Rome , and some of the ash reached Africa , Syria and Egypt . The emperor Titus , Pliny 's patron , appointed a board of magistrates to relieve the distress in Campania and he went there himself to supervise the disaster relief first hand . <p> Mount Vesuvius . Image : Will Mather . <p> Pliny the Elder does not seem to have been aware that Vesuvius was a volcano , though he mentions the ones in the nearby Aeolian Islands and Mount Etna in Sicily . Earlier authors did think it had been an active volcano from the scorching found on its summit , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The link between volcanic eruptions and earthquakes was also not yet understood . Pliny held the common view that they were caused by wind : <p> I think there is no doubt that winds cause earthquakes .

Pliny the Elder , Natural History II 192 <p> A devastating earthquake in 63 AD that destroyed parts of Herculaneum and Pompeii was most likely caused by magma rising beneath Vesuvius . Another major earthquake in 64 AD destroyed the theatre at Naples . Although many fled the area after the 63 AD earthquake , tremors had become so common just prior to the eruption that they ceased to cause alarm . <p> In his will Pliny left his entire estate to his nephew , and also adopted him . His nephew then took his name to become Pliny the Younger . He went on to have a successful political and literary career , hence the survival of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in which he described the eruption of Mount Vesuvius has not survived .

They were built in their hundreds and have the honour of being amongst the last wooden sailing vessels to remain in commercial use in Australia . <p> The pearling trade involved the collection of mother-of-pearl shell as the principal stock , but also the related collection of trochus shell and beche-de-mer . It suggests images of an exciting and glamorous tropical life , but the reality is quite different . It was dangerous for the lowly paid divers , and for many of the great the number of competitors involved it was a difficult trade in which to make any profit . One person who stood out and made a success of the business was James Clark , from Queensland , whose role in the development of the trade involved a close relationship with the development of the typical luggers used . Clark was self taught and an entrepreneur who understood the need to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Broome Luggers <p> The pearling lugger divides into two relatively distinct types , the Broome or North-West lugger , and the Thursday Island or Torres Strait lugger . Both shared some features , but were quite distinct in others , and remained this way for a long period . <p> The pearling industry began in the North West coastline around Broome in the 1860s , firstly collecting shell from the shoreline . When these stocks were depleted divers began to be used in deeper water , and primitive diving equipment became available . A purpose built craft soon began to appear , developed by the WA builders in Perth and Fremantle . By the early 1880s the typical boat was around 30 to 35 feet long , 11 foot beam and ketch rigged . Some carried the standing lug rig and it is thought that this is the derivation of the term lugger . <p> A significant development appears to have occurred when the Fremantle builder Charles Walker began building luggers around 1888 , ( he was formerly from Sydney and the North Coast of NSW ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by then established proportions needed to suit the regular beaching of the craft in the large tidal range around Broome . However Walker 's boats were over 40 foot long , fore and aft schooner rigged , and the hull is described as being refined a little to be more yacht-like . They were built of jarrah , white gum frames , with karri pine decks and topsides . It is unknown if Walker designed them as well as being the builder ( which is quite possible ) , but contemporary reports show they were the fastest of their type and much admired , and at least one is connected to a fleet operated by a then young James Clark <p> AE Browne was another significant builder in the early days and his advertisements note his development of a successful double ended type . <p> Other builders appeared to follow this lead from Walker , but some craft were ketch rigged , although the relative size of the two mainsails is quite similar judging from contemporary photos . The Broome style of lugger was now fully formed and the hull @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changes to the proportions . The schooner rig though seems to change to a ketch , probably more suited to drifting while the diver slowly scours the bottom . Despite the various rig changes , the term lugger was established as the name for the type , and further confusion exists in the way some of the sails were named . <p> Thursday Island Luggers <p> Clark did not stay long in the North West . New fields for shell were opened up in Torres Strait and he moved to that area in the early 1890s . At this time new boats appeared , quite unlike any seen before and not evolved from previous shapes used in the industry . These boats were 35 to 45 feet long and up to 12 foot beam with an elegant yacht-like hull in profile and section . They had a deep keel , a long elliptical counter , and were ketch rigged . This rig was proportioned with a small main on the aft or mizzen mast , and a larger mainsail and single foresail on the main mast . <p> Clark and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all of a similar size . Surviving records , documents and plans show that the Sydney based naval architect Walter Reeks had designed a number of them , including craft in 1891 when the style seems to first appear . This is an important connection as Reeks was the premier racing yacht designer in Sydney and Australia . In the 1890s Clark also owned two racing yachts designed by Reeks . The quite sudden appearance of this yacht-like vessel now seems most likely to be the direct result of Clark commissioning Reeks to design vessels appropriate to the needs of the task and the area . <p> The style or concept appears almost unchanged until the 1920s and the craft were built in NSW , Queensland and Thursday Island , including a number built by the Japanese shipwrights on Thursday Island . The boats built on the east coast used New Zealand kauri for planking and local hardwoods for the framing and other structure . <p> Background <p> The two distinct styles relate to their areas and mode of operation .

Another characteristic that developed on many Broome luggers was an overhanging bow and short counter stern . <p> In contrast the Torres Strait boats stayed at sea for longer periods , based in fleets around schooners as mother ships . They needed to be sea-kindly and fast to reach new grounds , and a yacht style hull with a finer shape , higher bilge and sharper dead rise , plus a deep keel suits these demands exactly . The ketch rig performs better sailing upwind , and the small mizzen suits the drifting operations .

New boats developed fuller sections aft to accommodate the volume and weight of the engine and fuel , and once their reliability was accepted , the sail area reduced on both types . Transom sterns appeared on some craft as a construction preference , and both types began to look a little more like each other , especially as the Thursday Island luggers could reduce their draft with the engine taking over from sail for making longer passages . The last of the Broome and Thursday Island style of luggers were built in the 1950s , and these craft were over 50 feet long .

Twenty-year-old Tukliwon was a sailor on one of the Dutch ships that had fled to Australia following the Japanese invasion in 1942 . He had worked on Sydney Harbour ferries during the war . The day after he heard the proclamation broadcast , he walked across the city to inform the Seamen 's Union of Australia , who promised their support . <p> A few days later Tukliwon and his fellow sailors were told that the Dutch wanted their Indonesian crews to take ships back to Java .

The only motivation of the Indian sailors was solidarity and support for another Asian country also seeking its independence from colonial rule . <p> Narrated by Australian actor Peter Finch , the film premiered to an audience of Indonesians in Kings Cross , Sydney , on 9 August 1946 .

When Cook was unable to find this land , he continued to New Zealand , charted both islands and took notes on the people and their way of life . He sailed to the east coast of New Holland ( Australia ) and , turning Endeavour north , sailed up the east coast . Charting this unknown coast for the first time , the Endeavour was nearly lost when it struck a reef south of modern day Cooktown . Before leaving , Cook took possession of the eastern portion of Australia in the name of King George III . <h> The new navigation <p> In the 15th century , Portuguese explorers developed the method of finding latitude ( position north or south of the equator ) by simple astronomical observations of the sun or a star . However , finding longitude ( position east/west ) was a matter of estimation based on the distance sailed and the course steered .

A clock was needed that would keep perfect time at sea . <p> Aboard Endeavour on his first voyage ( 1768-1771 ) , Cook had the latest scientific and technological equipment available but no clock . The Admiralty supplied copies of the new lunar prediction tables , the Nautical Almanac , as well as sextants to calculate position at sea by the lunar distance method . <p> By the time of Cook 's second voyage on Resolution ( 1772 -1775 ) , an accurate ship 's clock had been developed by John Harrison and tested by the Admiralty .

But her life began much earlier than this , when a passionate maritime enthusiast had one big idea . <h> The original idea <p> The proposal that led to this full-scale and accurate replica of Cook 's Endeavour came from an early museum council member , Bruce Stannard , a writer with a passion for maritime history and some high-powered contacts . <p> The Bond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , pledged financial support to the project , offering it as a gift to Australia for the 1788-1988 Bicentenary . Bond is famous as head of the syndicate that became the first challenger in 132 years to win an ' unwinnable ' yachting event , the America 's Cup , from the New York Yacht Club in 1983 . <p> Construction began in a specially designed shipyard in Fremantle , Western Australia in 1988 . <p> In 1990 , the Bond Corporation withdrew with financial difficulties . Enthusiastic volunteers kept the project going until the HM Bark Endeavour Foundation was formed with financial support from the Commonwealth Government , the West Australian Government and private benefactors . These included UK/Canadian businessman , Gary Weston ( Weston Foods ) and Sydney businessman , John Singleton . Both were impressed by the expertise , dedication and determination of the Fremantle team . <p> Over the next two years , finances continued to cause problems . At one time the whole team , from the CEO to the cleaner , agreed to a cut in wages to avoid anyone being laid off . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <h> How the replica was built <p> The original Endeavour was surveyed during its Royal Navy service . The documentation and plans ( held by the National Maritime Museum , Greenwich , England ) were used to research and build the replica . <h> Timber <p> The replica is so faithful to the original that the main differences lie in the timbers and metals used in construction . Traditional timbers of the 18th century - elm , oak and spruce - are now difficult and expensive to buy . The replica is built of jarrah , a West Australian hardwood . The masts and spars are from old-growth oregon ( Douglas fir ) , specially imported from the USA . <h> Iron <p> The ship 's traditional iron fittings , including lanterns and the large iron firehearth , were handmade in a specially installed blacksmith shop . <h> Rigging <p> After computer-simulated testing , modern polyester was selected for the running rigging ( which moves and works the yards and sails ) and traditional manila for the standing rigging ( which holds the masts in place ) . The manila @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ specifications of the original rope . <h> Sails <p> Endeavour 's sails are made of Duradon , a synthetic canvas that looks and handles like the original flax canvas but lasts longer and resists rot . <h> Modern fitout <p> The necessary concessions to the 21st century - engines , generators , an electric galley , showers and safety equipment - are all hidden away in the cargo hold where Cook stored his ship 's provisions . <h> The first journey <p> On launching day , 9 December 1993 , Endeavour slipped safely into the water , curtseying as she went . The masts and rigging were installed , the ship was commissioned and sea trials began off the coast of Western Australia <p> On 2 October 1994 , eight years after the keel was laid , Endeavour set out on her maiden voyage to Sydney . To celebrate the 225th anniversary of Cook charting the east coast , Endeavour followed in his wake to Cooktown and then crossed the Tasman to circumnavigate New Zealand . She returned to Fremantle to refit for her first world voyage . <h> Around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Endeavour sailed from Fremantle on the first leg of her world voyage . Visiting Mauritius , Reunion Island , Durban and Cape Town , she arrived in London on 25 March 1997 . HRM Queen Elizabeth II and HRH the Duke of Edinburgh came on board to meet the crew . <p> Her first visit to Whitby a few weeks later drew record crowds , as thousands lined the cliffs and headlands to welcome the Endeavour replica to the original Endeavour 's birthplace . <p> After a successful 15-port visit , Endeavour departed Plymouth on 14 January 1998 for North America . Stopping at Tenerife , the British Virgin Islands and Nassau , she arrived in West Palm Beach , Florida , on 5 March 1998 . She then completed a 31-port tour of the east and west coasts of North America in 19 months . <p> On 12 October 1999 , Endeavour sailed from Vancouver , Canada , for the Hawai'ian islands , Fiji and New Zealand . Endeavour finally sailed through Sydney Heads on 3 June 2000 . <p> She had been away 4 years . <h> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years completing her circumnavigation of Australia and starring in BBC documentary The Ship . She arrived back in her building port of Fremantle in December 2001 for a new challenge - to double Cape Horn , the southernmost tip of South America and the graveyard of many sailing vessels . <p> Endeavour successfully rounded Cape Horn on 16 April 2002 , in good weather and visibility , much as Cook had done in 1769 : En route the ship visited the Falkland Islands , Rio de Janeiro and Azores , and arrived in Whitby , England , on 21 June 2002 . <p> Using Whitby as her home port , the ship sailed British and European Atlantic coastlines from Spain to Norway , including Holland , Norway , Sweden , Denmark , Spain , France , Portugal , Canary Islands and Madeira . She was often the centrepiece for re-enactments of maritime history . <p> On 8 November 2004 , Endeavour set out from Whitehaven on her last voyage under the HM Bark Endeavour Foundation . On her way home she visited Funchal in Madeira , St John Antigua , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and arrived in Botany Bay on 10 April 2005 . <p> Endeavour had safely sailed some 170,000 nautical miles , twice around the world . In over 200 voyages , around 8000 men and women experienced 18th-century seamanship . Hundreds of others joined day sails in harbours and rivers around the world . Hundreds of volunteers worked as guides and helped during refit . Endeavour visited 29 countries and many Pacific islands , and opened as a museum in 116 ports . Thousands of visitors came on board to see how Cook and his men lived . <h> Coming to the museum <p> In April 2005 , the ship was transferred to the Australian government by the foundation which had operated it since launching in 1993 . The replica was then gifted to the Australian National Maritime Museum . <p> With funds for its operation , and to develop the systems and personnel to operate the ship , this was a spectacular new challenge for the museum , both in its nature and scale . <p> Endeavour spent 2 months at Garden Island , Sydney , in late 2005 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overhauled and refurbished from the top of the mast to the keel . The world-acclaimed replica emerged looking absolutely stunning , tarred , painted and varnished in meticulously researched , authentic finishes . <p> The Endeavour was then ready to sail again and was soon voyaging to Melbourne for the 2006 Commonwealth Games . Since the ship has sailed over 20,500 nautical miles around the coast including a circumnavigation of Australia in 2012 . <p> You too can have the voyage of a life time as voyage crew and experience sailing this magnificent ship . Voyage crew learn how to rig , climb aloft , steer , stand watch and sleep in hammocks like the original crew . See Sail the Endeavour <p> Endeavour is maintained using traditional practices and skills to ensure her seaworthiness and authenticity as an 18th century working vessel . Looking around the deck , you are likely to see crew members busy keeping the ship in shape . <h> Searching for the Original <p> Archaeologists are searching for the remains of HMB Endeavour in Newport Harbour , Rhode Island , USA . The search is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Rhode Island Marine Archaeology Project ( RIMAP ) . <p> Dr Abbass ' research shows that Endeavour was paid off by the British Royal Navy after returning to England . It was renamed Lord Sandwich and used by the British Board of Transport to carry troops to North America during the American War of Independence . In August 1778 , the Lord Sandwich was scuttled with 12 other transports in Newport Harbour to blockade the port against an invading French fleet . <p> Although Dr Abbass and RIMAP are greatly interested in the Lord Sandwich , their main objective is to research , record , document , interpret and help protect all the vessels lost in Rhode Island waters during the American War of Independence . <h> Surveying the wreck site <p> In 1999 , a combined RIMAP-ANMM team surveyed a promising wreck site . They analysed the construction techniques and timber scantlings , and identified sediment , stone and coal , ruling out the possibility that the wreck was the Lord Sandwich . However , their efforts showed that the team 's methodology could identify the ex-Endeavour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2000 , the team conducted a remote sensing survey of Newport Harbour to identify potential wreck sites . A limited test excavation was done on one possible site , GAMMA , revealing a large transverse timber ( possibly a frame ) lying directly over what appeared to be the keelson of a ship . <p> Measurements indicated that the wreck was an 18th-century vessel , between 300 and 400 tons and of similar construction to some of the scuttled transports . <p> In 2001 , the combined team excavated further at the GAMMA site . They found the remains of the keelson , stem post and additional floor timbers which can be compared to the original plans of the Endeavour drawn up by the Deptford Dockyard in 1768 . <p> The team also uncovered additional timbers , including internal or ceiling planking , iron fastenings and treenails , floors and futtocks ( the components that make up the frame of a ship ) and , eventually , the keel itself . <p> The scantlings ( timber measurements ) of the excavated remains were compared to the four known sets of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of other known transports . <p> Of the transports known to have been scuttled in Newport Harbour , the results compared favourably with : <p> The archaeological work continues and Dr Abbass has asked the ANMM 's continued involvement in the project . The museums director has been invited to join the board of the Foundation for the Preservation of Captain Cook 's Ships , a USA organisation providing administrative and fundraising support for RIMAP 's work .

This low sandy spit south of Townsville , Queensland , was in dire need of a lighthouse to help ships serving North Queensland ports . The lighthouse was built from local hardwood and clad with iron plates imported from Britain . Staffed by a keeper and three assistants , it was moved twice when threatened by the sea . When an automatic acetylene light was installed in 1920 ( operated by a sun valve ) , the lighthouse was de-staffed . In 1987 , it was replaced by a modern tower . It was transported to the museum in 1994 , re-erected on our North Wharf and fitted with the type of clockwork and kerosene mechanism used in 1913 .

Cook made his second and third voyages on board the Royal Navy ship to the Pacific and through the Northwest Passage in 1772 and 1776 respectively . It was during this third and final voyage that Cook was killed in Hawaii in 1779 . The Resolution went on to service the navy in the East Indies before it was captured in 1782 by the French warship Sphinx . It is believed that Resolution worked under different names in the French whaling industry until it was finally condemned at Newport , Rhode Island in 1792 . <p> This sternpost was generously donated to the Australian National Maritime Museum by the Newport Historical Society in Rhode Island , both in recognition of its substantial historical value as well as to the cultural bond between two countries .

@@77262744 @5962744/ <h> The Bronze Sailors Lost in Wax <h> Windjammers <h> Castaways <p> The art and craft of modelling and working up a work of art in bronze " the material of choice for public statuary for thousands of years " has changed very little over the millennia . <p> The lost wax casting technique requires highly skilled artists and artisans , even more so if the work is figurative . It is a fascinating process " in this case , the six-month sculpting process has seen the sculpture refined and modelled , cast in positive and negative forms several times in various materials to gradually take shape to embody the spirit of the concept . The sculpture is not cast in one piece , but in sections that are eventually joined together in a virtuoso display of welding , fettling and finishing . <p> Behind the scenes of making the Windjammers Sailors . Edited by Alex Parker . <p> The brief was to enhance the ideas in the original concept " two men in a moment of danger wrestling with the wheel " and reinterpret them as a contemporary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if it were created in the 21st century , rather than 500 years earlier , and so that it responded to its projected location on the wharf at the Australian National Maritime Museum , repopulating that wharf with some of the ghosts of its past , and adding people to the site in a traditional figurative form and technique but in a modern and contemporary frame. - This first step involved modelling in miniature in plasticine to produce a maquette . <p> This process involved defining the key spatial relationships and poses " a very time-consuming exploration of form , fabric , wind and weather . The artists used real-life models , including in Brett Garling 's case himself , dressed in heavy wet weather clothing alongside a mock-up of a wheel . They experimented with various questions : how is the body positioned at the helm of a big sailing ship ? Where are the hands and feet located in order to handle the wheel in heavy weather ? What about the water ? How might it work with the materiality of bronze ? <p> So the artist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wheel , to each other and to the sloping plane on which they were to be located , representing the sloping deck of a ship . This mock-up modelling process gave a crude idea only , but was critical to assessing the overall form the work would take at full scale , life-size . <p> The maquette was produced . Interestingly , well after this process was completed an original bronze maquette made by Dennis Adams from his sketch was located in the collection of the Aland Maritime Museum in Finland . As this was not identified at the time , the artists had freedom to explore and experiment with from and aesthetic , resulting in a dynamic energetic figure group , interestingly minus the water rushing over the deck . <p> Bronze maquette made by Dennis Adams mid 1980s . <p> Collection : Alands Sjofartsmuseum . <p> The overall work was then scaled up and sculpted in clay from the maquette . It was roughed out and then worked in fine detail . And each sculptor had a different way of doing this , either by eye or computer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " the modelling was initially done by computer to determine the basic figure sizes and proportions and then by eye to model the figures in clay . <p> A coat of plaster roughing was first applied to the steel and polystyrene armature of the figures and the filigree wire of the clothing , which enabled the clay to stick . The clay needed to be kept wet , so the work was covered when not being worked on and sprayed with water to keep it malleable . <p> Artist Brett Garling modelling in clay . Images : Zoe McMahon / ANMM . <p> This is the creation of the work , the playful , crafted and tactile process where the artist works with clay to create the forms , poses , relationships , textures and surface finishes they are hoping for . This process , called the sculpt , took a large amount of time , scaling up and exploring ideas presented in the maquette . <p> Importantly , the artist had extensive experience and a deep understanding of the lost-wax bronze casting technique , and the flexibility a waste @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in creating the finish they desire . The high surface resolution it offers enables the artist to be experimental to pursue a highly textured and highly finished surface , in this case enabling Brett Garling to create a highly impressionistic surface treatment . In understanding how the bronze is finally represented , in harmony with the material <h> Clay to silicone mould " a negative form <p> It is at this stage that the foundry artisans , Matt Dunn and Phil Gordon , artists themselves , came into the frame . Their depth of experience and abilities would enable them to replicate the artist 's hand in bronze , in a highly skilled and calibrated process . They eventually produced a perfect bronze representation of the clay sculpt through stages involving differing materials and techniques , as the form of Windjammer Sailors somersaulted from moulds to casts and back again . <p> The critical next step was to cover the clay surface of the sculpt in layers of liquid silicone to make a silicone mould of the sculpt . The primary purpose of the silicone mould was to enable the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ casts . <p> The first layer of silicone , a casting silicone , captured the fine detail and texture of the clay surface " the artist 's hand . This critical first layer was very thin and runny and applied with great care by pouring or with a fine brush . The silicone was built up in layers , the outer layers being thicker until the mould is produced . The biggest risk to the process here is that the silicone is applied when the clay is still soft and damp and you could damage the form . Hence a degree of caution is used when applying the silicone layers . <p> Clive Calder at Australian bronze delicately applies the first coat of silicon to capture the surface of the sculpt . Images : Zoe McMahon / ANMM . <p> Early on a decision was made to use the wheel of the James Craig , an 1874 trading barque owned by Sydney Heritage Fleet and moored alongside Wharf 7 , near the eventual site for the work , as the model for the helm . The silicone mould was made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ link between the windjammer sailors referenced in the sculpture , but more than that it created interesting tensions and some excitement in modelling the real timber artefact and the imagined artist 's work in clay . Such was the delicacy and exactitude of the silicone capture that the grain and details of the timber wheel are indeed evident in the bronze cast of the finished work . <p> The wheel was modelled from the real wheel of the James Craig . Images : Zoe McMahon and Daina Fletcher / ANMM . <p> The foundry artisans then assessed the overall work to prepare for casting. - It was not cast in one piece , but in segments " an arm , a head , a torso and so on . <p> Matt and Phil marked delineations and joints and sectioned the figures to enable the moulds to be removed , to determine the size of segments to be cast and the location of the splits or joins to enable the removal of those silicone/plaster moulds , which was intrinsic to this process . <p> Applying the keys , creating a Godzilla @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ / ANMM . <p> These joints were then lined with silicone rubber keys " ridges " and walls which enabled sections to be lifted out and dipped for subsequent casting . They gave each piece structure and defined the edge of sections to be removed . Because the silicone rubber mould is not firm , the sections were coated in acrylic plaster for rigidity and support . Importantly , these plaster jackets prevented the silicone from distorting , because if the silicone segments were to distort the work would be at risk of failure , the segments or sections unable to be put back together . <p> The negative silicone mould was then removed in sections . The challenge was to demould very gently by locating the split in the plaster casing to remove it from the clay/polystyrene model underneath . The clay was now waste because the silicone mould " the negative form " had captured the texture . <p> This silicone mould was reassembled and taped up , still inside its casing or jacket . This ensures no distortion when the melted wax is poured into it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Casting wax was melted at high temperature , and the bubbles tapped out . It was then poured in layers inside the silicone mould very carefully to build up to about 6 " 7 millimetres in thickness . Care was taken with the temperature of the wax ( hot on cold ) and the cooling of layers between each pour . The biggest danger in this step is distortion , air bubbling and surface delamination when the top wax layer peels away , so to avoid this great care is taken with the comparative temperatures of the new wax layer and previous layers . <p> The wax casting of the wheel from the James Craig . <p> Image : Zoe McMahon / ANMM . <p> The thickness of the wax would eventually be equal to the thickness of the bronze when cast in its final form . <p> The wax forms were then demoulded , removed from the silicone and plaster casing and cut where necessary to accord with the foundry 's facility and casting process . This was a delicate process because the wax is exacting and fragile . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the foundry artists ' skill and experience proved critical . <p> Once demoulded , each piece was then checked carefully for accuracy for trueness against the clay form . It is quite an exacting process to ensure that it did it in fact represent the artist 's hand . <p> The wax cast was the sculpture , a positive form in fragile wax , in pieces .

Akarana was built in Auckland to compete in Australian regattas in 1888 and 1889 . The yacht is a fine historic reminder of the friendly and often fierce sailing rivalry between Australia and New Zealand . <p> Akarana ( Maori for ' Auckland ' ) won its race in 1889 Anniversary regatta with a first prize of 20 pounds and 3 cases of Moet &amp; Chandon Champagne .

In races that were composed of only 5 or 6 entrants , Akarana was competing ' for the honour of New Zealand ' against yachts and crews from Melbourne , Sydney and Tasmania . The fine-lined , extremely narrow yacht raised expectations by beating the centreboard yachts of the St Kilda Yacht Club in a challenge race before the Regatta . <p> Rated at 7 tons with a 5 ton ( 5.1 tonne ) lead keel , Akarana then beat Cooeeana , Madge , Galatea and Pert to first place in the 5-10 ton class race for keel and centreboard yachts . In rougher weather Akarana trailed the fleet when racing against yachts of a similar length , and yachting commentators said that Akarana was more suited to smooth water and light winds . <p> Robert Logan then took his yacht to Sydney to compete in the National Regatta on Anniversary Day , January 1889 . Skippered by Dick Hellings , Akarana won the principle event of the day , an open race for the first prize of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , beating Sydney yachts Assegai , Sirocco and Iolanthe .

These included progressive reduction of the rig , loss of the lovely counter stern , and modifications to the keel and rudder resulting in shallower draft and much-reduced ballast . The original lead keel was removed in the mid 1920s , and not replaced until a smaller section of lead was added in the 1950s . <h> Restoration <p> Akarana 's speedy reconstruction in New Zealand , to return the yacht to Australia for the 1988 Bicentennial celebrations , allowed little time to research its former configuration . The stern was rebuilt but the underwater body remained in cut-down form .

Evidence of this evolution can be seen by comparing the skulls of cetaceans . <h> Conquering the Oceans <p> Other adaptations included a longer wider jaw with loss of differentiation in the teeth . In some whales , the ability to filter rather than chew became important . The hind legs regressed , while forelimbs evolved into flippers , tails became flukes and bodies grew more streamlined , while fat replaced fur . <p> 23 million years ago , there was a burst of cetacean diversification and today there are 84 known species ! <h> Like a mammal in water <p> Like land mammals ; cetaceans taste , feed , breathe , move , see , reproduce , communicate with each other and use touch to experience and survive in their watery environment . They do this through many unique adaptations . <p> Baleen whales or mysticetes feed on tiny prey like krill and some also eat small fish . They feed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the baleen . What remains is their meal . <p> The toothed cetaceans or odontecetes have anything between two pairs of teeth in the beaked whale to 260 in some dolphins . The teeth are not used to chew but to snare and immobilise prey . <p> Cetaceans have lungs like other mammals and must surface at regular intervals to breathe air . <p> They dive to search for food and to evade predators . A sperm whale , for instance , can dive to depths of 3,000 metres and can retain its breath for more than two hours ! <p> Cetaceans are excellent swimmers and use their fluke for propulsion . They do this by beating their fluke up and down , rather than side to side as fish do . Did you know that their spectacular leaps out of the water actually increase speed ? This is because air creates less drag than water . <p> Sound travels for four to five times faster in water than in the air . As we might expect , hearing is highly developed among the cetaceans . They use two different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to find food and sound to communicate among themselves . The song of the humpback whale can be heard 300 kilometres away and the songs of males during courtship are the longest and most complex known among any animal . <p> A sense of smell is almost non-existent in cetaceans : their nostrils are almost always closed ! On the other hand , their sense of taste , vision and touch is highly developed . <p> Reproducing underwater is tricky when you 're a mammal , but cetaceans have evolved to enable this . <p> Unlike pinnipeds ( seals , sea elephants etc. ) , cetaceans do not need to return to land to reproduce . It is difficult to tell the sex of most cetaceans by sight but the long tusk of narwhales and the tall rectangular dorsal fin in killer whales indicate the males among these animals . <p> The female cetacean gives birth to her young underwater .

During the period of nursing , which is also devoted to the learning process , a strong bond is formed between the mother and her young . <h> Humans and Cetaceans : The Ups and Downs <p> Many myths and legends accompany our passion-filled , if often ambiguous relationship with the whale . <p> Since antiquity , cetaceans have inspired mythology and literature and more recently cinema . Long considered terrifying monsters from the deep as well as intelligent companions , today they spark our admiration . <p> Everywhere in the world , the whales of mythology have appeared on a scale from monstrous to divine . In many legends , their impressive size has even lent them the role of living islands . Despite or perhaps because of the fear they inspire , humans have from early times set out to test themselves against these formidable " monsters " . <p> Before regulations limiting the hunting of whales , whaling was the main threat to cetaceans . Points of view @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the exhibition to the visitor . What is your opinion ? <p> Commercial whaling began in the 9th century . Technological advances of whaling equipment and vessels , over the centuries , led to the killing of a vast number of whales , indiscriminate of species . Despite the measures adopted by the International Whaling Commission in an attempt to regulate supply , some species like the blue whale are still threatened with extinction . <p> The hunting of small cetaceans is much less than that of the large cetaceans but does exist in both local and commercial forms , though the latter has never reached the international dimension of whaling . Small cetaceans are hunted for consumption , but also for use as bait by crab fisherman and even for use as fertiliser or poultry feed . <p> Whaling is not the only human activity to seriously threaten cetaceans . The list is long ; ocean and noise pollution , climate change , loss of habitat , collisions with ships and accidental capture through large scale commercial fishing practices . <p> Visit the exhibition and peer into the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> This whale season immerse yourselves in the wonderful world of whales !

Anthony recalls his father , despite his family 's fears , donning his white doctor 's coat and a Red Cross helmet and venturing out to treat the wounded when the bombing raid had ended . <p> By August 1945 , after the dropping of atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki , the Japanese armed forces surrendered . But Indonesia was still occupied by Japanese troops . <p> An Indian soldier covers the advance of British Stuart light tanks towards the railway marshalling yards at Surabaya . <p> Credit : Imperial War Museum , SE 5663 <p> In October , Allied land forces arrived to take over from the Japanese .

Their mission was to supervise the surrender of the Japanese forces still occupying much of Indonesia and prepare for the return of the Dutch colonial government . <p> Anthony was fortunate not to have witnessed other major conflicts that occurred in Semarang at this time . The power vacuum after the surrender of the Japanese gave Indonesian nationalists a brief window to organise an independent Indonesian republic before the Dutch returned . In Semarang , Pemuda and Heiho ( military organisations ) were formed and seized weapons from the Japanese soldiers . In some cases the Japanese willingly gave their weapons to the nationalists or did n't contest their confiscation . But at Semarang docks the Japanese refused and struck back in a reprisal attack , killing up to 2,000 Indonesians . <h> Independence : four years of struggle <p> With the war 's end , the Dutch were anxious to return to the colony they had lost in the Japanese invasion of 1942 .

Anthony remembers a spacious waiting room able to accommodate up to 70 patients , and always a line of becaks ( rickshaws ) waiting outside under a large banyan tree . Payment was often in the form of fruit , eggs or poultry in lieu of money . Festival days saw the house filled with gifts of cakes and flowers , many of which were discreetly donated to local hospitals and charities .

By early 1949 , it seemed to many outside the country that the Dutch had actually regained control of Indonesia , as they disseminated propaganda that the Republican Movement had failed . Indeed , Yogyakarta had fallen and many Republican leaders had been captured or were in hiding . <p> Despite this , apart from random searches by the Dutch military , and water and power rationing , for most Semarang citizens daily life carried on as usual . But the Indonesian nationalists had not given up . In March 1949 under Commander Suharto , they staged a dramatic attack on Yogyakarta that galvanised Indonesian support . With increasing international focus on the situation in Indonesia , by the end of 1949 the Dutch had come under pressure " led by the Australian Chifley government- " from the United Nations and finally recognised Indonesian independence in December 1949 . <h> The Dutch- remain in Indonesia <p> A group from a Dutch-Chinese Catholic school about 1940 <p> Credit : Tropenmuseum , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Wikimedia Commons <p> In this post-independence environment in Indonesia , many Dutch or people with Dutch heritage or connections chose to stay in Indonesia to continue to run the big Dutch companies and corporations . It was at first an arrangement that suited the new republic , in need of skills and financial investment . But amid this unusual situation of ex-colonials running the main businesses in the newly independent Indonesia of the 1950s , there was an underlying tension . <p> Anthony 's father , fluent in the Dutch language ( as was his whole family ) , had the foresight to seek a Dutch-recognised qualification in paediatrics from Amsterdam University from 1952 till 1954 . During this time , Anthony , aged nine , and one brother attended a school in Holland , and they continued- their education in Dutch-run schools on their return to Semarang .

The Indonesian government began to pursue a policy against Dutch interests in Indonesia , provocatively seizing the Dutch shipping line KPM and other Dutch companies . There were mass demonstrations against the Dutch , and the government decreed that the remaining Dutch nationals were to leave Indonesia . Many returned to the Netherlands . <p> In the midst of this increasing anti-Dutch sentiment and an exodus of Dutch families , Anthony 's Dutch school closed its doors and for several months and he and his brothers attended an Indonesian school . There were only two universities in Indonesia at the time , Jakarta and Jogyakarta , so entry to an Indonesian university was limited . Because they felt there was no future in Indonesia , and anti-Chinese sentiment was escalating as well , in 1958 Anthony 's parents decided to send him to his uncle in Singapore to continue his high school education . <h> Australian connections @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ western NSW , around 1932 <p> Wong family collection <p> But Anthony was once more forced to move schools and countries .

Her father was born in Cobar in 1906 , one of six children of Wong Sing Foo and Ah Kue ( nee Kong ) who had come to Australia escaping poverty and desperation in China around 1900 .

After Anthony read an article by political historian Dew Cottle about Fred Wong 's activities in Sydney in the 1930s and 40s , they realised there was a long-standing connection between their two family histories . <p> Helen had known little about her father 's support for Indonesian independence .

While Dutch troops were returning to colonise Indonesia by force , Dutch film maker Joris Ivens was making a film in Sydney in support of Indonesian independence . While Australian soldiers supported Dutch efforts in Indonesia , Australian maritime workers imposed a black ban on Dutch military ships and cargoes . And while the Australian government was tied to Dutch recolonisation , it was simultaneously repatriating Indonesians from Australia back to Republican-held- territory . <p> The personal stories of Anthony and Helen reflect a time of international conflict as well as cooperation in the confusing period of post-World War II decolonisation across Asia .

The submarine 's identity was confirmed later the same year by a team of Australian archaeologists led by Dr Mark Spencer and Tim Smith . The initial site survey provided critical information about the submarine 's condition , clarified its historical and archaeological significance , and proposed options for its long-term management . <p> In September 2007 , an archaeological assessment was conducted inside AE2 's conning tower and control room via use of a specially developed drop camera . The camera was inserted through the submarine 's partially-open conning tower hatch , and provided the first images of the interior hull since AE2 's loss in April 1915 . These images revealed that the submarine 's internal components are in an excellent state of preservation , and that high potential exists for the retention of intact artefacts . <p> In June 2014- Project Silent Anzac conducted a final maritime archaeological assessment of AE2 . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of AE2 .

The hatch has been carefully opened to 80 degrees , and now swings freely on its original hinges allowing access into the conning tower and control room below . <p> Courtesy Project Silent Anzac <p> No crew were lost when AE2 was scuttled , but speculation about what might survive inside the submarine and how best to preserve AE2 ultimately led to the formation of the AE2 Silent Anzac Project led by retired submariner Rear Admiral Peter Briggs . <p> Craning the temporary diver support platform ( DSP ) over the side . This was placed adjacent to AE2 's conning tower to provide a working platform for the divers . The diving bell is the foreground @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together the expertise of the Australian Submarine Institute ( ASI ) , scientists and engineers from the Defence Science and Technology Organisation ( DSTO ) , ROV manufacturer Seabotics , archaeologist Tim Smith , conservation specialist Dr Ian McLeod , plus an experienced team of Turkish commercial divers to carry out the work under water . <p> Before arriving in Turkey the team had developed a range of cameras , an ROV and other equipment specially designed to get inside the submarine and to record its interior . Another invention was a dive platform designed to sit close to AE2 's conning tower , providing a safe and stable working platform for divers . On the surface , the ship Kaptani Derya 2 supported all diving operations , and was a home-away-from-home for the project . <p> The project goals this year were to inspect the exterior of the submarine for any damage caused by trawlers ; to take corrosion readings on the hull to establish a datum for measuring the long-term effect of installing cathodic protection ( zinc anodes ) around the hull ; to open the conning tower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room below the conning tower ; and finally to fly ' a small ROV into the control room spaces to record the interior of the submarine for the first time in almost 100 years . <p> With the ship held in place exactly above AE2 by four large anchors , one of the ROVs was sent down to locate the submarine . The ROV is fitted with cameras that send images through a cable to the surface , where they are shown on monitors mounted in a temporary shed on the ship 's deck . It was spellbinding to watch the rubbery marine growths attached to parts of the deck and superstructure . After this initial inspection the dive platform was craned over the side and carefully manoeuvred into place using the ROV , to great effect . Having successfully completed this task it was time to send the divers in to do a visual inspection of the area around the main hatch . <p> A diver ( in the yellow helmet ) is assisted into the diving bell <p> Courtesy Project Silent Anzac <p> All diving on the project @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ implies , the bell is a tubular pod in which two divers are lowered to the working platform . Only one of the divers undertakes the assigned task ; the other stays in the bell to provide backup if required and to watch over operations . Due to the depth , the divers have only just over 20 minutes to complete their work before slowly returning to the surface with several decompression stops . The last stage of decompression is completed aboard the ship in a hyperbaric chamber under the watchful eye of the doctor and her technical assistants . The process is slow and limits diving to just three dives a day . <p> Conditions throughout the two weeks of diving were ideal and each day produced a little more progress towards sending the ROV inside AE2 . The conning tower hatch had been expected to create difficulties , but in the event it opened relatively easily , revealing the interior of the conning tower . By this stage there was a palpable air of excitement surrounding the DSTO team as they prepared the ROV and finally sent it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the first moon landing will understand something of the anticipation as the ROV was manoeuvred into the conning tower for the first time . It was immediately obvious that the interior of the conning tower was preserved in an extraordinary state , with very little concretion build-up . Even timber cabinetwork ( perhaps the flag locker ) had survived . AE2 's engine telegraph , light fittings , gauges and other fittings all came to life as the ROV 's cameras and lights rotated slowly through 360 degrees . The atmosphere in the DSTO monitoring shed was electric as each new object appeared on the screens . <p> The interior of AE2 's conning tower is illuminated by a remotely-operated camera system inserted into the open conning tower hatch . <p> Courtesy Project Silent Anzac <p> The next day the mood aboard the ship was optimistic . The weather was unchanged and after the previous day 's success it seemed a relatively simple task to lower the ROV through the next hatch and into the main control room . But , as so often happens , nothing is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prevented the ROV from fitting though the lower hatch . This was disappointing , but luckily the scientists had brought a second , smaller ROV as well . <p> While the cameras on board this ROV were inferior to those of the larger machine , it passed through the lower hatch easily and was soon sending back excellent footage of the control room . <p> In the days that followed , the team was able to complete all the remaining tasks and leave Turkey with an enormous amount of footage and stills imagery to examine in detail in the months ahead . AE2 is a real time capsule and it was a privilege to be a part of the project . <p> Later in 2015 , when Project Silent Anzac concludes , the Australian National Maritime Museum will receive the project 's extraordinary archive of film and other data recording the condition of the submarine and become responsible for continuing the positive relations between Australia and Turkey that have been established by the project . <p> Keep your eye on the museums blog over the coming months as we develop the archive of material from Project Silent Anzac.

It originally used an automatic acetylene light with a sunlight-operated valve to turn it on and off . Painted red with its name in huge letters on the side , it was easily recognisable to navigators . <p> The light on CLS4 was powered by a six-month supply of acetylene gas held in tanks . The flow of gas , which was ignited by a pilot flame , was controlled by an automatic mechanism to produce the characteristic code of flashes . A warning bell tolled with the rolling of the ship . <p> The lightships felt the fury of the sea and were frequently rotated between pairs and returned to port for maintenance .

Shoals and shifting sandbanks which often lie out to sea and may be submerged at high tide present a very real danger to shipping .

It is taken under tow to its position at sea or to return to port for maintenance or repairs . The machinery space is instead used for equipment to run the powerful light for months at a time .

His first commission was a yacht , and Halvorsen quickly received more work constructing cruising racers .

Halvorsen boats were a prominent feature on many Australian waterways , and the Halvorsen cruiser was a favourite pleasure craft for many holiday makers .

Their hopes for a better life in Australia were echoed in the vessel 's name , which means ' freedom ' . The first ' boat people ' fled the turmoil of South Vietnam in simple coastal fishing craft , often unsuited to a long ocean voyage . Tu Do 's passengers were lucky , outpacing pirates in the Gulf of Thailand and surviving violent storms at sea . <h> Photo Gallery <h> More info <h> History <p> When this Vietnamese fishing boat was acquired by the museum in 1990 , very little was known about Tu Do 's history . The name , meaning ' Freedom ' , hinted at the motives of its passengers who were part of the exodus from South Vietnam after the fall of its capital , Saigon , to communist forces in 1975 . The boat 's Vietnamese registration documents identified its home port and the name of the owner and his wife . Research into immigration records @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't until 1995 , when a museum curator finally tracked down the original owner in a NSW country town , that the full story unfolded . <p> Tan Thanh Lu was a 30-year-old businessman who meticulously planned his secret escape - with 38 others - from the new regime which he feared . He had Tu Do built specially for the voyage . A typical fishing boat design of Phu Quoc Island off the southernmost part of Vietnam , the boat plied its trade for six months to allay suspicion and to help pay for crucial supplies which were hidden in his fellow voyagers ' houses . <p> When he was ready to set off Mr Lu staged an engine breakdown so that surveillance of Tu Do would be relaxed . A powerful replacement engine was installed by night and his group set off in the dark , pushing the boat across kilometres of tidal shallows before starting the motor .

Turned away from one port on the Malaysian coast , the group managed to land in Mersing where eight of the exhausted passengers disembarked as refugees . After a month , and unsuccessful approaches to US Embassy officials , Mr Lu bought more supplies with some of his gold and sailed for Australia with his remaining 30 people . <p> In Java they were resupplied and encouraged to move on by Indonesian authorities . Off Flores they rescued another Vietnamese refugee boat which had run aground and towed it across the Timor Sea to make an Australian landfall near Darwin .

He spends weeks and months with whales off Tonga , Dominica and the Great Barrier Reef where he immerses himself in the water and remains motionless , waiting for humpback , minke and sperm whales to pass less than two metres away from his lens . <p> The result is extraordinarily intimate and detailed portraits that illuminate the majesty and spectacle of nature 's underwater giants . <p> Beautiful Whale represents Austin 's 20 year journey exploring the depths of possibility to connect people with the greatest minds in the water . <p> Exclusively at the Australian National Maritime Museum in Sydney , the exhibition is the largest collection of Bryant 's work to date , made possible through the USA Bicentennial Gift . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Austin is an experimental multi-media artist whose life-long passion has been exploring the depths of possibility in connecting with the greatest minds in the waters . The impetus behind his work is the thought of losing over five million years of evolving culture and communication in the largest brain ever to exist on Earth ; to not only lose it , but to never understand what we 've lost . His journey and challenge to recreate the transcendent sensation one experiences floating an arms length away from the eye of an inquisitive whale , has compelled him to create breath-taking photo mosaics at " whale scale " - both in terms of size and in the level of detail witnessed in real life . This inspiration was brought to light in 2004 when , floating motionless , he felt a gentle tap on his shoulder , one that felt too solid to originate from a dive companion . As he slowly turned to investigate the taps source , he came eye-to-eye with a 40 tonne female humpback whale . She had reached out with her almost two tonne , 4.5 metre @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know that she was behind him . <p> Her eye was fully illuminated from the late afternoon sun scintillating over his shoulder . Looking into her eye , he saw for the first time the calm mindful expression of a whale peering into his own eyes . In that instant he saw clearly what had been missing in the four decade effort to visually communicate the reality of whales - moments like these documented on their terms , at their scale . The epiphany was powerful and clear , leading him to sell everything he owned , including his home , and leaving a job of eight years at a sea otter research facility . By 2009 , Austin composed the largest and most detailed photographs of whales that have ever existed in the world .

It is within these precious , fleeting moments that I begin painting the cave slowly raising the camera to my eye and then to the eye of the whale . Her calm mindful gaze gracefully moves out of my field of view , and as her massive girth glides past , I compose a series of photographs . The result is a life-size mosaic , revealing her entire length in all of its intricate detail texture and tonal range intact . The eye of the whale is now captured in perpetuity , forever transfixing her viewers with a calm , mindful gaze . Even hours after my encounter , I am rendered speechless ; my brain processing the moment trying to comprehend her evident consciousness , her gentle attentive nature that ensured she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I own , all that is secure , to be among these creatures , patiently awaiting a connection between species ; patiently awaiting the ambassador of whales . <p> My gift to her and her brethren is to take those moments and share them with my global tribe in unprecedented scale and fashion ; to ultimately allow whales to inspire unexplored thought and emotions . <h> Wild About Whales ? <p> The official whale watching season is on now until the 30 November 2014 .
