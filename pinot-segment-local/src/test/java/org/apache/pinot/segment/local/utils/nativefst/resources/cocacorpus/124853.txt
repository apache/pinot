Medina Correspondent <p> In the wake of several firings and resignations , the Florida Agriculture Center and Horse Park lost the signature donation that was meant to bridge Western and English horse disciplines and connect the park with its local roots . <p> Carol Harris said she could not , in good conscience , donate Rugged Larks memorabilia , including a life-sized bronze statue , to the park after the recent tumult . Rugged Lark is possibly the most successful and recognized quarter horse in history and , despite his death in 2004 , is still an equestrian star . The horse was bred by Harris in Marion County . <p> " I damn sure do n't  want Rugged Larks memorabilia in the hand of someone who you do n't  know what they are going to do next , " Harris said . <p> Rugged Lark was a two-time American Quarter Horse Association World Show Superhorse as well as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both English and Western disciplines . <p> Harris said the collection will eventually be donated , but the only thing she is sure of is that it will not go to the horse park . <p> " No , I ca n't go back to someone that has failed so many times . That does n't  make sense to me , " she said . <p> Harris decision comes in the wake of the abrupt firing of Shawn Doherty from the executive director position at the park on May 3 . Since Doherty was fired , three-fifths of the executive committee has resigned . Don McDuffee , board chairman and Becky Schatt , second vice chairman , resigned late last week . Charlie Hicks , first vice chairman , resigned shortly after Dohertys firing . <p> Mike Joyner , Floridas assistant commissioner of agriculture , asked the full board during their regularly scheduled meeting on May 3 to terminate Doherty , due largely to Dohertys sometimes curt and abrasive personality . Dohertys defenders argued his personality was a known quantity for years and that Joyners lobbying of each individual board @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pressure on the board members . <p> " Everything was going so well and then we got all this political interference , " said McDuffee , who is a Marion County quarter horse breeder . <p> McDuffee said certain board members closely tied to lobbying in Tallahassee started exerting their own influence on state government officials . Then , several months ago , Joyner insisted that McDuffee present the resume of Tenley Struhs to the board with the idea of hiring her as assistant park director . <p> Her father , David Struhs , is politically tied to the Bush family . David Struhs , who currently is an executive with Domtar Co. , one of the largest paper producers in North America , was Gov . Jeb Bushs secretary of the Department of Environmental Protection . He also served under President George H.W. Bush and was reportedly up for consideration for Environmental Protection Agency director under President George W.

Adam Putnam , who is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and appoints the members of the horse park board . <p> " Tenley was pretty much forced on us , " McDuffee said . <p> Now , without an executive director , Tenley Struhs is the defacto leader of the park . <p> " She is not ready . She just does n't  have the experience . The park is n't ready . Its not ready for a white collar person . We still need someone who is blue collar . Someone who can get in the dirt and fight with the contractors and get the job done , " McDuffee said . <p> The park is in the midst of a construction phase that includes a new entrance , more barns and other additions . It is being funded with $5 million the state gave to the park last year .

Nikki , 16 at the time , was so fed up with school back then that she often argued with her mother , Roxanne Collins , about quitting . <p> By spring 2016 , Nikki was still struggling in school when her ailing grandmother , Mary Lou " Nanny " Popson , spoke during her final days battling ovarian cancer . <p> Nanny asked Nikki not to quit . She asked her granddaughter to work hard and become the first person in the family to get a traditional high school diploma . She told Nikki that she wanted her to be the first family member to walk at graduation . Soon thereafter , on May @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accounts , Nannys wishes resonated with Nikki , who decided to work harder to honor her grandmothers wishes . Last fall , during the first semester of the 2016-17 school year , she earned mostly " A " grades and even made the honor roll . She was destined to be the first in her family to receive a traditional diploma and , above all , walk at graduation . <p> But all that changed just before Christmas last year when Nikki became i 'll with viral pneumonia . Within a week , she died at UF Health Shands Hospital in Gainesville . <p> That prompted Summer Lee Lynn , 28 , to begin a quest to walk in her sisters place at Belleview High Schools graduation , which is set for Saturday . Before her death , Nikki had already purchased her senior pictures and had ordered her cap and gown . She was so excited to walk . <p> After more than four months of being told by school district officials that she could not walk in her sisters place , Lynn learned Friday that Superintendent of Schools Heidi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Lynn wrote in a Friday text to the Star-Banner . The message came about an hour after she was interviewed about how she refuses to take " no " for an answer . <p> Lynn told the Star-Banner during several interviews during the last several weeks that her sister wrote about graduating in a class assignment , called " Reflection Essay . " The essay revealed that Nikki was a talented makeup artist . <p> " I will walk with the class of 2017 and do whatever it takes to be noticed as a world-class artist and cosmetologist , " she wrote in the essay , which described how her one-time dysfunctional family had revived itself and it was time to look to the future . <p> In January , Lynn asked Belleview High Principal Mike Kelly if she could wear her sisters cap and gown and walk in the graduation . She was told that would set a troubling precedent . After all , officials said , students who are one-half-credit shy of the mandated 24 needed to graduate are not allowed to participate in the schools @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go . In March , she asked again . Again , Kelly denied her request . About two weeks ago , Lynn began emailing and calling the press , including three Orlando-area television station and the Star-Banner . <p> Early last week , school district spokesman Kevin Christian announced that Maier offered Lynn a seat on stage with her . Christian said Lynn could receive a special honorary diploma on her sisters behalf . But the district would n't allow her to wear her sisters cap and gown and walk on the stage . <p> Christian noted that the district had never allowed a family member to walk on behalf of a deceased family member , and that doing so would create potential issues down the road . That changed late Thursday when the district discovered that , back in 2010 , the sister of a Belleview High senior killed in an automobile crash did walk in her brothers place . Once that information was discovered , Maier called Lynn on Friday to inform her that she could walk . <p> " That ( early case ) is the precedent , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we immediately called her . " <p> Christian said the school administration at Belleview High has changed many times since 2010 , and there have been three superintendents and different administrations since then as well . No one knew that there was a similar case in 2010 . That case was never publicized . <p> Once Kelly watched a video of the 2010 graduation , he verified that the sister of the deceased student did walk and received the honorary diploma . Kelly immediately contacted the district office . <p> " That was the verification we needed , " Christian said . <p> In the end , Roxanne Collins will get to see one of her children walk across the stage and receive a diploma . Collins said it will be special for Lynn in two ways . <p> Lynn herself dropped out of Belleview High School in about 2005 , two years before she was slated to graduate .

With that chiseled physique , Hunnam is built for royalty . But as the dude doing the sword pulling , he is given the impossible task of elevating material that fails him miserably .

It feels like a confluence of " Game of Thrones " ( its even got Little Finger himself in Gillen ) and the Oscar-winning " Gladiator , " yet never comes close to rising to their level .

His stylized stamp modernizes the well-worn Round Table lore , but those gimmicks are offset by one-note characterizations , predictable plot points , and Laws Vortigern .

Cash is expected to be the go-to gift again <p> Anna-Louise Jackson <p> Graduation season is in full swing and for many Americans that means one thing : It 's time to head to the ATM . <p> Cash is expected to be the go-to gift again this year for new grads , followed by greeting cards and gift cards , according to survey results released this month by the National Retail Federation . The appeal is obvious : The recipient can spend the money how she pleases , there 's no hassle with receipts or returns and minimal effort is required of the giver . <p> If you like the idea of giving cash but want something with more oomph , consider stock . It potentially has a longer shelf life and higher returns . A gift of stock also helps a recipient learn how to invest . <p> There are some considerations unique @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recipient 's immediate financial needs . Here are four questions to consider before you give stock . <p> 1 . Are stocks the right gift ? <p> It 's generous to help someone invest for the future , but be cognizant of the recipient 's pressing needs . Does the new grad have high-interest credit card debt ? Is he facing uncertain job prospects ? Does she have forthcoming expenses ( moving to a new city , for example ) that could push her into debt ? <p> If ' yes ' is the answer to any of the scenarios above , the gift of investments may not be practical . Even worse , a cash-strapped new grad could be tempted to sell the stocks and forgo the long-term benefits while also triggering taxes . <p> If the gift is for a minor , there are ways to limit when or how she 'll access that investment . By setting up a custodial account , you 'll manage the account on her behalf until she 's of age ( generally 18 or 21 years old , though some states allow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point , she 'll be free to do with it as she pleases . <p> + MORE : Give your child the gift of stocks <p> 2 . To transfer or to buy ? <p> There are two basic ways to give stocks : transferring shares you already own or buying new ones . Deciding which is best will depend on your current holdings and the tax implications for the recipient . <p> Since the gift is being made with the recipient 's best interest in mind , you should know that transferring shares to them means you 're also transferring any capital gains tax burden for those shares . When it comes time to sell , they 'll face realized capital gains based on the stock 's value when you first bought it . <p> For example , if you 're gifting 100 shares of a company that you bought at $25 a share and the recipient sells when the stock 's trading at $40 a share , they 'll pay taxes on a capital gain of $1,500 . If instead you were to buy and gift new shares @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ per share and they sold it at $40 , they would only pay capital gains on $500 . <p> If you still want to transfer shares of an existing holding , the process varies depending on how you hold the stock " in a paper certificate , with a brokerage or through direct registration with the company . Contact the institution that oversees your holdings to find out what steps and paperwork are needed to complete the transfer . <p> In general , you 'll need the following : a description of the securities you 're gifting ( company name , ticker symbol and number of shares ) , your account number and your contact information , as well as the recipient 's full name , Social Security number , contact information and the account where the investment should be transferred . <p> If the recipient is a newbie to the world of investing and does n't have a brokerage account , you may be able to transfer stocks through the Direct Registration System . This will put the recipient on the books as an investor with the company . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't currently own ( or you do n't want to part with your own shares ) , you have choices . Much like a transfer , you 'll need to direct this purchase to an account in the recipient 's name by buying shares directly through the issuing company or a brokerage . <p> Several websites cater to people who want to give stock , including GiveAshare.com , SparkGift.com and Stockpile.com , but there can be a premium for novelty . Buying one share of a company and having the certificate framed could cost as much as twice the stock 's current trading price on GiveAshare , for example . For any of these sites , be sure to check fees , which may be higher than a traditional brokerage . <p> + MORE : How to buy stocks <p> 3 . How generous do you want to be ? <p> Whether you 're transferring shares or buying new ones to kickstart a new grad 's investment portfolio , there are likely limits to your generosity . The IRS agrees . <p> You can give annual gifts up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any number of recipients and you 'll be exempt from paying federal gift taxes . Go above that amount and you 'll owe . <p> Your altruism has other tax implications , as well . You get a tax benefit when transferring stock by avoiding capital gains taxes on that investment , but as noted above , the recipient assumes that burden . For new investments , there 's no capital-gains tax benefit for the giver and the cost basis for the recipient is the value of the investment at the time of purchase . <p> 4 . What lessons do you want to impart ? <p> Cash may be king at graduation , but it 's also here today , gone tomorrow . Stock gifts can be memorable and meaningful beyond the potential for financial gains , as Alex Whitehouse 's story shows . As a toddler , he received 10 shares in a utility company from his grandfather . <p> ' At first I was just excited to receive something in the mail with my name on it , but later on it sparked an interest in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dividends , ' says Whitehouse , who is now president of Whitehouse Wealth Management in Vancouver , Washington . ' That gift had a huge impact on me . It led me on the path to becoming a financial advisor . ' <p> Now , Whitehouse helps his clients pay this forward , recommending grandparents gift stock to their grandchildren , particularly shares of companies that will resonate with the younger generation . <p> Stock gifts require more planning than stuffing money into a greeting card . But by making that effort , perhaps you 'll spark an early interest in investing or help the recipient plan for the future " and it 's impossible to predict where that may lead .

It 's recess for all , no matter what . <p> Just to be clear on what this means : For a short time each school day , kids in grades K-5 will be allowed to get away from their desks , stretch their legs , horse around with their friends , and maybe even run around a bit outside . <p> Then they will go back to work . <p> Could this daily respite from studies possibly help children ? Could a break from test prep , test taking , and test result reviewing possibly be useful in the molding of young minds ? <p> These are some of the great questions of our time . Who could possibly know the answers ? Oh , if only Socrates , Plato and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Since the great philosophers are long gone , I reached out to Dr. Reece S.

Please describe your methodology . <p> Answer : To start , I polled 3,200 students , grades K through 5 , at schools nationwide . I asked whether they wanted recess every day , some days , or never . <p> Q : What were the results ? <p> A : In the final analysis , 104 percent of the students polled said they wanted recess every day . <p> Q : 104 percent ? <p> A : We discovered that several students voted twice . They were from Cook County , Illinois , so we let the voting results stand , lest we be accused of cultural and historic insensitivity . <p> Q : I see . That 's an amazing result . I cant imagine any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A : Amazing , yes , but not unprecedented . My colleague , Dr. Pete Zahsgrate , conducted a similar study concerning school lunch . 112 percent of respondents , again in grades K-5 , said they preferred pizza instead of carrot sticks . <p> Q : 112 percent ? <p> A : More multiple votes . The sampling might have been higher , but some paper ballots had to be discarded because they were soiled and couldnt be properly read by our computer scanner . <p> Q : Soiled ballots ? From kids ? <p> A : Many of the papers were streaked with tomato sauce . Also , a few were signed " Bugs Bunny , " which the research team suspected was a nom de plume . <p> A : I conducted a separate nationwide survey of K-5 teachers and had mixed results . <p> In theory , teachers liked the idea of giving the kids , and themselves , a bit of a break during the day .

Will it be OK to give K-5 students recess each and every day ? <p> A : Oh , absolutely . My findings clearly show that recess is popular with kids and teachers , albeit with some well-founded concerns from the latter group . <p> And besides , from what I understand , Marion County is looking for ways to boost student performance . I do n't  see how recess could hurt , and it might well help . <p> Q : To be safe , perhaps we should try the 20-minute daily recess experiment on adults first , just to see if there are any deleterious effects .

On the first day of the experiment , once recess started , the staffers ran away . <p> Q : Where did they go ? <p> A : We tracked them to a nearby K-5 school playground . They were begging the students to change places with them after recess . <p> Q : What did the kids do ? <p> A : They laughed .

It typically takes years of unfortunate choices " minimum credit card payments , forgone savings opportunities " to create suffocating debt <p> Liz Weston <p> Some financial disasters are a long time in the making . It typically takes years of unfortunate choices " minimum credit card payments , forgone savings opportunities " to create suffocating debt or a poverty-level retirement . <p> Other disasters you can trigger almost instantly . The decision itself costs money , or the clock starts ticking toward a consequence you might not have foreseen . Here are three common ways to trash your finances fast , plus how you may be able to undo or limit the damage . <p> Cash out your 401(k) <p> Withdrawing even small amounts is an expensive mistake , even a 401(k) loan to consolidate debt , and the damage is worse the younger you are . <p> Cash-outs trigger taxes and penalties that can eat up $250 to $500 for every $1,000 that 's withdrawn . That money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but also lost are all the future tax-deferred gains that money could have earned . <p> Figure that a $1,000 withdrawal costs $4,000 or more in future retirement income , assuming a 7% annual return compounded monthly over 20 years . The tab doubles , to $8,000 , if you 're 30 years from retirement . It doubles again to $16,000 or more with 40 years to go . <p> This is obviously a theoretical example , because actual returns will vary . The point is that any money taken out of a 401(k) is no longer earning tax-deferred returns , and those returns ca n't earn their own returns . The compounding that works miracles when you invest works against you when you withdraw , and the toll only grows with time . <p> Miss a credit card payment <p> You get busy . There 's a family crisis . Money 's tight . The statement never arrives . Whatever the reason , you do n't pay your credit card bill . You catch up the next month and figure you 're just out a late fee . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ single missed payment " one that 's 30 days or more late " can drop credit scores by 100 points or more . That turns great credit to average , or worse , which may mean higher interest rates and a greater possibility of getting turned down for credit . Recovering from this drop can take as long as three years . <p> The cost can ripple well beyond credit accounts . A Consumer Reports investigation found that people with merely ' good ' credit could pay hundreds of dollars a year more for auto insurance than those with excellent scores . ( The penalty for ' poor ' credit can be $1,000 or more . ) Credit scores can matter more than any other factor , including driving record , when determining premiums , Consumer Reports found . <p> Try to hide from the IRS <p> What 's worse than owing a lot of money to the IRS ? Failing to file a tax return when you owe money to the IRS . <p> The penalty for failing to pay taxes on time is 0.5% per month of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : 5% per month . Plus you 'll owe interest on the balance . <p> If a return is n't filed , the IRS can Frankenstein one together based on the information it collects from employers , financial institutions and other government agencies . Then the agency can pursue you " relentlessly " for what it says you owe . It can seize wages and bank accounts , put liens on homes and even pursue criminal charges against people who refuse to pay . Ask actor Wesley Snipes , who served more than two years in prison for willfully failing to file returns . <p> You can fix it <p> Most people can limit the damage from unpaid taxes even after years have passed by filing any missing returns , paying as much of the tax owed as possible and setting up an installment plan for the rest . <p> Other mistakes , though , have a much smaller window for making a correction . <p> You can turn a cash-out into a rollover by depositing a 401(k) check into an IRA or a current employer 's plan , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days from the date you get the money . You 'll also have to dig into your pocket to cover the 20% that 's usually withheld or that portion will be taxed and penalized . <p> Paying a credit card bill late but before the account is 30 days overdue turns a painful credit score hit into a credit non-event . The lapse wo n't be reported to the bureaus or calculated into your scores . The issuer might even waive the late fee if you ask ( and if it 's the first time ) . <p> Even if it 's too late to prevent the fallout this time , keep in mind that everyone makes money mistakes . The ones who wind up with more money tend to be the ones who learn from those mistakes .

Theirs is a festering union that began to go off the rails at the first sign of adversity . Theyve been fighting about everything from dirty dishes to joyless sex ever since .

The result is better than marriage counseling . They 're getting gigs and record companies are taking notice .

Yeah , right . Most of the movie , though , belongs to Pally and Lister-Jones , two actors whove cornered the market on making obnoxious characters not only tolerable , but likable .

We 've compiled the evidence and developed a theory that Wren was n't meeting Spencer at all , but actually A.D. pretending to be the Liar . Here 's what we 've got . <p> Wren 's excuse for meeting Spencer was that he had a huge layover and she was " kind enough " to help him kill some time . Wren lives in London .

Ezra was there because he only needed to hop a short flight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wren to be there unless it was planned . <p> 2 . Spencer was not emotionally in the right place for this very convenient hang out <p> Okay , let 's pretend we believe Wren magically got stuck in Rosewood and texted Spencer , " Come hang out at an airport with me , " then Spencer was like , " I have a cyber stalker trying to send me and my friends to prison and you 're the creeper who hit on me when I was 16 , but sure . Let 's chill . " I can do that . I have been trained to suspend that amount of disbelief for Pretty Little Liars before . <p> A Pretty Little Liars Bundle of Joy Could Be a Heartbreaker <p> Here 's what I ca n't ignore though : right before Wren allegedly called to inform Spencer of his layover , she was being cornered by Marco ( Nicholas Gonzalez ) about the fact he 's basically confirmed she has something to do with Archer 's ( Huw Collins ) death . When Spencer left Marco she was visibly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like she was having a super fun day just catching up with her ex-boyfriend/almost brother-in-law ?

The coat would wrinkle and Spencer Hastings is not a monster , people . Did the temperature that night suddenly rise so she no longer needed it to keep warm ? Plus , " Spencer " is wearing all black , which we know is A.D. 's color scheme . If there 's no jacket , this must be a racket . <p> 4 . " Spencer " wants this meeting hush-hush <p> After the super awkward meeting with Ezra ( and PLL fans racked their brains to figure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ met before ) , Spencer asks that her former English teacher not tell anyone he saw her at the airport . Why would she be so worried about her friends finding out about it ? If that was really Spencer , she would have told them she was going to talk to Wren in the first place . Ezra is also the only Liar significant other to still be in the dark about End Game , so he 's the only person who could have caught Spencer at the airport with Wren and not think it was weird . The timing is SO weird . <p> No , we 're not talking about a charcoal mask . A.D. has been using the fake-face trick a lot recently .

You may want to reconsider . <p> Friday <p> Jun 9 , 2017 at 3:00 PM <p> Christopher Ingraham -The Washington Post <p> Nearly 40 percent of people who use marijuana say they do so primarily to help them relax . New research from the University of Illinois at Chicago suggests that many of those folks may be overdoing it . <p> As it turns out , there has n't actually been a whole lot of research done on the stress-mitigating effects of pot , according to Emma Childs , Joseph Lutz and Harriet de Wit of UIC . So they conducted a randomized , double-blind lab experiment involving 42 test subjects to see how different doses of THC - pot 's main chemical ingredient - affected the subjects ' responses to stressful situations . <p> The test subjects were divided into three groups . The first group received an oral dose of 12.5 milligrams of THC .

They had to give a five-minute speech , followed by a five minute oral test of subtraction skills before two interviewers . For the final twist of an anxiety-inducing knife , the researchers videotaped the subjects while this was all going on , and included a video display of the interview in the room where it was happening . <p> The researchers then measured how well the subjects performed in the speech and arithmetic portions , and asked them to subjectively rate how stressful the experience was for them . <p> The burning question : Did the subjects who dosed on THC perform better in the tests and report less anxiety ?

A low dose of marijuana is the way to go if you use it primarily for relaxation purposes . <p> There are , of course , some big caveats with this .

@@97886806 @2086806/ <h> Q&amp;A : Internet extremism and how to combat it <p> DETROIT ( AP ) " In the wake of Britain 's third major attack in three months , Prime Minister Theresa May called on governments to form international agreements to prevent the spread of extremism online . <p> Here 's a look at extremism on the web , what 's being done to stop it and what could come next . <p> Q. What are technology companies doing to make sure extremist videos and other terrorist content does n't spread across the internet ? <p> A. Internet companies use technology plus teams of human reviewers to flag and remove posts from people who engage in extremist activity or express support for terrorism . <p> Google , for example , says it employs thousands of people to fight abuse on its platforms . Google 's YouTube service removes any video that has hateful content or incites violence , and its software prevents the video from ever being reposted . YouTube says it removed 92 million videos in 2015 ; 1 percent were removed for terrorism or hate speech violations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up late last year to create a shared industry database of unique digital fingerprints for images and videos that are produced by or support extremist organizations . Those fingerprints help the companies identify and remove extremist content . After the attack on Westminster Bridge in London in March , tech companies also agreed to form a joint group to accelerate anti-terrorism efforts . <p> Twitter says in the last six months of 2016 , it suspended a total of 376,890 accounts for violations related to the promotion of extremism . Three-quarters of those were found through Twitter 's internal tools ; just 2 percent were taken down because of government requests , the company says . <p> Facebook says it alerts law enforcement if it sees a threat of an imminent attack or harm to someone . It also seeks out potential extremist accounts by tracing the " friends " of an account that has been removed for terrorism . <p> A. Since Edward Snowden 's 2013 disclosures about National Security Agency surveillance , several tech companies have started encrypting " that is , scrambling them to thwart spies " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ companies ca n't read them . Governments are not happy about that . <p> After the 2015 mass shooting in San Bernardino , California , and again after the Westminster Bridge attack , the U.S. and U.K. governments sought access to encrypted messages exchanged by extremists who carried out the attacks . Apple and Facebook 's WhatsApp refused , noting that they did n't hold the keys needed to unscramble such messages . Both governments eventually found other ways to get the information they wanted . <p> Some in government " including former FBI Director James Comey and Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California " have argued that the inability to access encrypted data is a threat to security . Feinstein has introduced a bill to force companies to give the government so-called " backdoor " access to encrypted data so that investigators could read messages on these services . <p> Q. Should n't tech companies be forced to share encrypted information if it could protect national security ? <p> A. Weakening encryption wo n't make people safer , says Richard Forno , who directs the graduate cybersecurity program at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simply take their communications deeper underground by developing their own cyber channels or even reverting to paper notes sent by couriers , he said . <p> " It 's playing whack-a-mole , " he said . " The bad guys are not constrained by the law . That 's why they 're bad guys . " <p> Building backdoors into encryption could also weaken it in ways that hackers , criminals and foreign agents could exploit . That could potentially jeopardize all sorts of vital data , from personal communications and documents to bank accounts , credit card transactions , medical history and other information that people want to keep private . <p> But Erik Gordon , a professor of law and business at the University of Michigan , says society has sometimes determined that the government can intrude in ways it might not normally , as in times of war . He says laws may eventually be passed requiring companies to share encrypted data if police obtain a warrant from a judge . <p> " If we get to the point where we say , ' Privacy is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be some setup which will allow the government to breach privacy , " he said . <p> Q. Is it really the tech companies ' job to police the internet and remove content ? <p> A. Tech companies have accepted that this is part of their mission . In a Facebook post earlier this year , CEO Mark Zuckerberg said the company was developing artificial intelligence so its computers can tell the difference between news stories about terrorism and terrorist propaganda . " This is technically difficult as it requires building AI that can read and understand news , but we need to work on this to help fight terrorism worldwide , " Zuckerberg said . <p> But Gordon says internet companies may not go far enough , since they need users in order to sell ads . <p> " Think of the hateful stuff that is said . How do you draw the line ? And where the line gets drawn determines how much money they make , " he said . <p> Others say the focus on tech companies and their responsibilities is misplaced . Ross Anderson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cambridge , says blaming Facebook or Google for the spread of terrorism is like blaming the mail system or the phone company for Irish Republican Army violence 30 years ago . Instead of working together to censor the internet , Anderson says , governments and companies should work together to share information more quickly . <p> Former Secretary of State John Kerry also worries about placing too much blame on the internet instead of the underlying causes of violence . <p> " The bottom line is that in too many places , in too many parts of the world , you 've got a large gap between governance and people and between the opportunities those people have , " Kerry said Sunday on NBC 's " Meet the Press .

She began ballet lessons at age 3 , was on the dance team in high school where she routinely performed splits , taught aerobics in college , and even met her husband at a gym . She continued to love running and dancing , although she stopped ballet training at 15 . Karp said her hip joints were unusually flexible but had never caused her pain , even though they would briefly lock periodically . <p> A few weeks after the Florida episode , Karp saw a Maryland orthopedist who specializes in hip problems .

He performed adjustments to realign her spine , which did n't help . <p> In May , she consulted her internist . He ordered a raft of blood tests , all of which were normal except for the level of cortisol , a stress hormone , which was slightly elevated .

" I had had extensive bloodwork and lots of tests " and was reassured that nothing serious was wrong , she said . <p> But in October , her mother , visiting from Florida , noticed Karp grimacing as she got up from the sofa . " She could n't believe I was still in pain , " Karp said . At her mother 's urging , she saw a third orthopedist . He gave her topical anti-inflammatory cream and suggested cortisone shots might help . <p> On the day her first shot was scheduled , Karp was unable to obtain it because of a paperwork glitch .

She told Karp she was probably suffering from a form of hip impingement the failure of the ball-and-socket hip joint to move smoothly . Impingement occurs in adolescence in part from repeated stress common in ballet . The head of the femur becomes abnormally shaped and no longer fits seamlessly in the acetabulum , or socket , putting the hip at risk of future injury . <p> The physical therapist advised Karp to see yet another orthopedist : Andrew Wolff , who specializes in arthroscopic hip surgery , in which miniature instruments reach damaged areas through small incisions . It is more often performed on shoulders and knees . Relatively few surgeons specialize in hips , a technically demanding procedure . <p> " I was cautiously optimistic , " Karp recalled . <p> At her initial appointment in early December , Wolff did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ordered an X-ray of Karp 's hips . <p> " The X-ray really did show the whole picture , " recalled Wolff , adding that he was puzzled at the failure of other doctors to order something so basic .

" It was as though my bones were a square peg trying to fit into a round hole , " she said . <p> A subsequent MRI scan showed that the impingement had shredded the labrum , the band of protective cartilage on the outside of the hip that helps cushion and stabilize the hip socket . Labral tears in dancers , as well as in people who play hockey , football , soccer and other sports , are common .

It is observed by avoiding leaven and is highlighted by Seder meals and retelling the story of the Exodus . <p> The Seder feast is held after nightfall the first two nights of Passover , which will be Monday and Tuesday . In addition to feasts held in private homes , The Chabad House Center for Jewish Life and Learning , which serves Marion , Lake and Sumter counties and The Villages , is offering community Seders both evenings . <p> Rabbi Yossi Hecht of Chabad Lubavitch outlined in an email message the 12 things he feels people need to know about Passover . <p> " As we approach the holiday of Pesach , we think of all the laws , customs and traditions associated with the holiday , and what this holiday represents to us personally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With his permission , the 12 steps are listed here : <p> 1 . Clean your home so it will not have any chametz in it before Passover . <p> Passover is a holiday that mandates our complete involvement , not just during its eight days but for weeks before . Aside from the regular holiday obligations , we are also commanded ( Exodus 13:37 ) : " No leaven shall be eaten ... For seven days you shall eat unleavened bread ... and no leaven shall be seen of yours in your possession . " We accomplish this by cleaning and inspecting our homes well before Passover , and gradually eliminating chametz from every room and crevice . This intensive cleaning takes place in Jewish homes throughout the world . <p> 2 . Search the house with a candle Sunday night , then burn what you find on Monday morning . <p> The 24 hours preceding Passover , the culmination of weeks of scrubbing and cleaning and preparation , is the final transition from our ordinary chametz lives to Passover . From nightfall of the day before until sunset @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that are guided by specific times . <p> 3 . Sell any chametz you want to keep for after Passover . Buy handmade shmura matzah for your Seder table . <p> Shmurah means " watched " and is an apt description of this matzah , the ingredients of which ( flour and water ) are watched from the moment of harvesting and drawing so they are kept pure until mixed to bake the shmurah matzah . <p> 4 . Prepare the feast The Seder includes reading , drinking wine , telling stories , eating special foods and singing . As per Biblical command , it is held after nightfall on the first night of Passover ( and second night outside of Israel ) , the anniversary of our nations miraculous exodus from Egyptian slavery more than 3,000 years ago . <p> During the evening you will have four cups of wine ; veggies dipped in saltwater ; matzah ; bitter herbs , often horseradish ( without additives ) and romaine lettuce , dipped into charoset ( a paste of nuts , apples , pears and wine ) . The meal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Each item has its place in a 15-step choreographed combination of tastes , sounds , sensations and smells . <p> 5 . Prepare a Haggadah , the primary text and guide for the Seder . The word Haggadah means " telling , " as its primary purpose is to facilitate the retelling the story of the exodus from Egypt . <p> 6 . Master the Seder Learn your part , and have the children practice the four questions . <p> 7 . Review the basics of the meaning and rituals of Passover . <p> 8 . Children are the highlight of the Seder . Help them get ready with games , videos and crafts . <p> 9 . Watch a talk from the Rebbe ( Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson , 1902-1994 ) about Passover . Be sure to share the inspiration with others . <p> 10 . Invite another Jew or two to your Seder table . <p> 11 . Celebrate Passover with family and friends .

Find a car loan for good , fair or bad credit <p> But sales downturns are n't the only marker of the best time to buy a new car . New-model rollouts , carmakers ' redesign schedules and other events can offer bargains to those who can read the tea leaves of the auto market . <p> Just picking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , cover the basics : Arrange auto financing , check local dealer inventories , and research pricing guides for the current market value of your desired vehicle . <p> Then , consider these five time periods when planning your purchase to snag a bargain . <p> 1 . Model changeover <p> The big three U.S. carmakers usually launch their new models during August and September while some foreign carmakers sprinkle new-vehicle introductions across the year . Most buyers are drawn to the newest models , which pressures dealers to offer deeper discounts and incentives to clear their inventory of the previous year 's models . <p> Dealers need to clear out the current year 's inventory to make room for incoming models , according to Jessica Caldwell , an analyst at car shopping site Edmunds.com . That 's good news for shoppers who will see some great deals on outgoing models , she says . <p> Furthermore , it means that ' as a consumer , I 'm not going to have to arm-wrestle or play the back-and-forth game to get a good price , ' says Dave Cavano , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more likely to cut to the bone more quickly " so it 's less of a hassle .

End-of-month pressure <p> ' Of the 30 days in the month , traditionally , the last five days are when the dealers have the greatest incentive ' to make a deal , the auto club 's Cavano says . <p> This is because some carmakers offer bonuses that increase when dealers hit certain sales numbers , says Christian Wardlaw , an analyst for the New York Daily News ' autos section .

Year-end sales <p> The final week of the year brings sales , particularly from luxury carmakers such as Lexus , Mercedes and BMW , Cavano says . It 's when ' manufacturers are trying to eke out those last few sales and they will push money out to their dealers and say , ' OK guys , let 's get this done . ' ' <p> Keep in mind , however , that as the year progresses and more cars are sold , the selection shrinks . So you might not be able to get your first choice of color and options . <p> 4 . Model redesign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in which they have both the outgoing and new models for sale at the same time . In some cases , this makes dealers and manufacturers eager to get rid of the outgoing model by offering high incentives and discounts . <p> But if you buy the outgoing model , its value would depreciate faster . This is n't a problem if you plan to keep the car until the wheels fall off . But if you trade it in just three years later , you will take a big hit . <p> And sometimes , the new model may be ' heads and tails better than the outgoing model , ' Wardlaw says . <p> 5 . Last year of a model 's production <p> This tip is for serious penny pinchers .

So weekend afternoons are n't optimal because besides higher pricing , the sales staff will be busy and test-drives will be rushed . Instead , shop midweek , communicating with dealers via text or emails . <p> Swapping advice about car buying is a great sport for buyers , and Wardlaw has a final recommendation : Do n't be lured by the promise of crazy deals .

Every Google search we perform , every Yelp review read or written , each item of clothing , houseware or electronic device we put in our virtual cart , is another data point companies can use to personalize our experience with their brands . <p> Despite all the data at their disposal , it seems many brands still do n't  fully understand what consumers want from them in terms of products or services or how to best engage with their end buyer . A recent survey from cloud and big data integration company Talend shows 88 percent of information technology leaders believe their organization truly understands its customers , while only 61 percent of consumers believe companies understand their needs . <p> This begs the question : How do we differentiate between those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ versus those that have a long way to go ? Second , how do we help the brands we love understand us better without sacrificing our privacy ? <p> 1 . Understand which data to share . <p> Think about your favorite shopping app or website . Does it know which brands you prefer ? What about your shoe size ? Does it have your zip code stored for shipping estimates ? Does it make appropriate recommendations ? The strongest relationships in life work both ways , so if you want a brand to know what you want from them , perhaps its time to share a little . Taking five minutes to fill out some basic profile information in your " preferences " could , at the very least , save you time on future shopping excursions and might even lead to a surprise find . <p> 2 . Use data to get the best deals . <p> When you 're shopping online , you can quickly compare prices for the exact item you want to purchase across multiple vendors , and , if you have time to wait , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best example is travel . There seems to be a never-ending list of websites available for booking flights and hotels , but booking the first flight you see without shopping around is rarely going to get you the best deal . Countless studies have shown booking on certain days of the week , or a particular number of weeks ahead of your trip , will yield the best results . From there , one still has to compare prices against different websites to find the best fare . Luckily , some of the top search engines are making this even easier for consumers by indicating whether the price is high or low . The art of finding the best deal is really in comparing the data . <p> 3 . Know where to draw the line . <p> At the end of the day , privacy is still important , and its prudent not to share too much personal information . Think critically about which data is going to be absolutely necessary to enhance your experience with the companies you rely on . For example , its not necessary to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're on a mobile device ) access to your camera if you 're using a music or financial app . Some brands ask for too much , and its up to each individual to determine which data makes sense to share with each brand and what does n't  . For example , do n't  be too quick to provide broad access to an app you 've just downloaded . Also , as painful as it may be , do read the privacy policy of the sites you frequent and understand how they use and protect the personal information they collect on you . <p> Ultimately , most companies today are still just scratching the surface when it comes to understanding the impact customer data can have on the profitability and success of their business . There is still a lot of room for growth when it comes to companies effectively using data to address consumer needs . Its up to each one of us to make sure we are sharing the right data with them , while also using that data to our advantage to get the best deals and online experience possible .

What do I do if I see a bear ? <p> A. If you encounter a bear at close range , remain standing upright , back up slowly and speak to the bear in a calm , assertive voice . Do NOT feed or intentionally attract bears . If a bear eats something on your property , take note of what it is and secure it once the bear leaves . NEVER approach or surprise a bear . If you see a bear from a distance , enjoy the experience , but do not move toward the bear . If you are close , do not make any sudden or abrupt movements . Back way slowly and be sure the bear has an obvious escape route . <p> If you are in your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ area and that the bear has a clear escape route . Then , make noise or bang pots and pans to scare the bear away . <p> Do NOT turn your back , play dead , climb a tree or run . Back away slowly into the house or a secure area . <p> Avoid direct eye contact . Bears and many other animals may view this as aggressive behavior . <p> Report any bear that is threatening the safety of humans , pets or livestock to the FWCs Wildlife Alert hotline , 888-404-FWCC ( 3922 ) . Cellphone users can call *FWC or #FWC . <p> Q. Are black bears fast runners or good climbers ? <p> A. Absolutely ! Bears can run up to 35 mph and climb 100 feet up a tree in 30 seconds . <p> Do n't  climb a tree . Bears are excellent tree climbers . Mother black bears often send their cubs up a tree when they sense danger . You do n't  want to end up in a tree with a couple of cubs above you and a mother bear below you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up fending off a bear in a tree rather than on the ground . <p> Do n't  play dead or turn your back on the bear . Back away slowly , make sure the bear has a clear escape route . Stop and hold your ground if your movement away seems to irritate instead of calm the bear . <p> If bears feel threatened , they may clack their teeth together , moan , blow , huff or paw the ground . The bear is showing that it is as uncomfortable with the situation as you are . These are not indications of aggressive intent or an imminent attack . Truly predatory or aggressive black bears are eerily silent . <p> Q. What do I do if the bear stands up on its hind legs ? <p> A. If the bear stands up , this is NOT an aggressive behavior . The bear is only trying to see you better to figure out what you are and assess whether or not you are a threat . Back away slowly , making sure the bear has a clear escape route . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward me or attacks ? <p> A. If the bear paws the ground , huffs and puffs , clacks and snorts , or runs directly at you but stops before reaching you and returns to where it started , it is trying to scare you off . If you stand your ground , the bear will likely stop and move away . No matter what happens , do not run away . Continue slowly backing away , talking and holding up your arms . The bear may charge or vocalize several times until it is comfortable turning its back on you and leaving . <p> While there have been no predatory bear attacks on people in Florida , more than a dozen people have been bitten and scratched by bears defending themselves , cubs or food sources . <p> If a black bear attacks you : Fight back aggressively . People in other states have successfully fended off black bear attacks using rocks , sticks or even their bare hands . Bears are wild animals and must be respected . Even though they are typically quiet and shy animals , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not take unnecessary risks .

Some are religious , others are not . But unlike almost everyone else , they do n't see less value in a stranger 's life than in the life of a close friend or relative , the researchers found . And they are genuinely puzzled that the rest of the world does n't view other people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it as something necessarily heroic or that they should be given praise for , " said Kruti M. Vekaria , a doctoral student in psychology who was part of the team that conducted a study published Friday in the journal Nature Human Behavior . " They think it 's something everybody should do . " <p> When asked directly why they would give up a kidney to a perfect stranger , " they see it as an obvious choice , " added Abigail A. Marsh , a psychologist at Georgetown who led the research team . " They just seem politely puzzled . They have trouble answering the question . " <p> Altruism is difficult to study because most generous acts , such as giving to charity , carry some benefit for the donor ( a tax break , for example ) . And small , kind gestures , such as holding a door open , are partly determined by social norms . <p> But undergoing a surgical procedure and increasing one 's own risk of future health problems is " painful , costly , non-normative , exceedingly rare and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the authors wrote . <p> " When we 're personally touched by something , that 's when we react to it , " said Angela Cuozzo , a 49-year-old from Albany , New York , who gave a kidney to a 25-year-old woman in Bakersfield , California , seven years ago . " We should take it upon ourselves to be a little more forthcoming and pay it forward before we 're personally touched by it . " <p> Cuozzo said that she was single with no children and going through a minor midlife crisis when she overheard a co-worker discussing his sister 's fourth kidney transplant . She began to research the idea of giving a kidney and discovered that she could participate in a chain kidney donation if she gave to a stranger . In that arrangement , organizers try to maximize the number of kidneys donated by having a friend or relative of each recipient give an organ to someone with whom they are a match , even if the person is a stranger . <p> " I just really needed to make sure that before I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . Her donation eventually went to the California woman , not the co-worker 's sister . <p> Vekaria said about 2,100 people had given kidneys to strangers out of a total of about 147,000 live donations at the time the research was conducted . <p> There is a drastic shortage of transplant organs in the United States . According to the United Network for Organ Sharing , 97,727 people are waiting for kidneys as of this week , and an additional 20,000 need livers , hearts , pancreases or other organs . <p> Previous research by Marsh has established that extraordinary altruists have larger than normal amygdalas , a portion of the brain involved in compassion . ( Psychopaths have smaller than normal amygdalas , she said ) . In brain scans , that part of altruists ' brains also appears to be more active than in average people when they are considering questions of altruism , she said . <p> But that does n't explain much , because the technology used to visualize brain activity is relatively crude and compassion for others is learned as one goes through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the team compared 21 kidney donors with 39 control subjects . First , they asked them to place avatars representing family , friends , neighbors and strangers on a computer screen at distances from an avatar for themselves , to test their views of " social distance " whether they consider themselves closer to strangers than most people do . They found that there is no significant difference between altruists and others . <p> Then the researchers asked people to play a money allocation game . In each round , they could keep larger sums for themselves by declining to give part of the money to another person a family member , a friend or a stranger , for example . Or they could give some money away , resulting in less for themselves . <p> The altruists consistently placed more value on strangers than ordinary people did . The altruists gave as much money to very distant strangers as control group members gave to a good acquaintance , for example . <p> That helped researchers conclude that the altruists simply do n't value strangers less than they value @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tend to view a stranger or even an acquaintance as any less deserving of resources , " Vekaria said . <p> In an article that accompanies the study , Tobias Kalenscher , who studies comparative psychology at Heinrich Heine University in Dnsseldorf , Germany , praised the research . But he noted that it still does not explain why altruists hold such views of strangers . And he wondered whether the outcome of the experiment might have been different if the study had used real money . <p> Still , he wrote , " In today 's zeitgeist of nationalist protectionism and populist individualism , this news inspires hope for the future . " <p> Extraordinary altruists receive no benefits from their donation and face some costs . The kidney donors often receive pressure from family and others who worry about their health . Some of their loved ones express concern that the organ wo n't be available if a relative needs it in the future , Marsh said . Cuozzo , who married after her donation , said her husband has told her that he would have strongly opposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Cuozzo did not discuss her decision with family and close friends until she was about to undergo surgery . Most were supportive , but without the enthusiasm she felt . One who works in health care was openly opposed . <p> " I like to say that maybe I 'm a little more compassionate and that has at times " been a disadvantage , she said . At work , Cuozzo , a graphic designer , said she is sometimes not assertive enough and has paid a price professionally . <p> " I 've often had people say ' you 've got to stop thinking about everybody else and focus more on yourself , ' " she said . <p> At 49 , she remains in good health , her day-to-day existence largely unchanged by the donation , she said . Except that " it was the most amazing experience of my life to this day , " she said .

It was made public in the predawn hours Monday and is tentatively scheduled for a House vote on Wednesday . <p> The catchall spending bill would be the first major piece of bipartisan legislation to advance during Trump 's short tenure in the White House .

As a result , the measure does n't look much different than the deal that could have been struck on President Barack Obama 's watch last year . <p> But Republicans are eager to move on to other issues such as overhauling the tax code and reviving their moribund effort to repeal the Affordable Care Act , Obama 's health care law . <p> While the measure would peacefully end a battle over the current budget year , the upcoming cycle is sure to be even more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and battles between Trump and Congress over annual agency budgets could grind this summer 's round of spending bills to a halt . <p> Among the final issues resolved was a Democratic request to provide the cash-strapped government of Puerto Rico with $295 million to cope with its Medicaid burden , a top Pelosi priority . House Republicans succeeded in extending a private school vouchers program for students in Washington , D.C.

The White House also backed away from language to take away grants from " sanctuary cities " that do not share information about people 's immigration status with federal authorities .

But , as Jim Couillard , director of Marion County Parks and Recreation , told the commissioners , Carney Island ultimately falls better in line with the countys long-term vision for the home . <p> " Were really excited about this opportunity , " Commissioner Carl Zalak said after the vote . <p> Discussions about the future of the home , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the FBI , have been ongoing since the Bradford family that has long owned it sold the lakefront property earlier this summer . The sale did not include the historic home and the family later offered the dwelling to the county as a donation . <p> The intention , then and now , is for the county to relocate the home and open it to the public as a museum . <p> Albright , who also is the countys tax collector , grew up beside the property and is close with members of the Bradford family . He proposed at a meeting last month that the Board of County Commissioners relocate the home to the nearby property of the Lake Weir Chamber of Commerce . But , rather than sign on to that plan immediately , the board opted to task a committee with detailing what exactly such a move would require .

It will sit on a 25-foot bluff , with a winding , tree-lined path leading to it , which will echo the homes original 1935 surroundings . Couillard said a garage and cottage , again mirroring those on the original property , could be constructed and leveraged for the museum . <p> The relocation will cost the county $262,541 , according to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sum from a reserve contingency fund . Private donations are anticipated to offset some of the costs . <p> That price is less expensive than hauling the home in one piece would have been , largely because slicing the home in two will allow movers to more easily bypass trees and utility lines on the route . A one-piece move would have an estimated cost of $322,041 . <p> Moving the home to the Lake Weir Chamber of Commerce property , in comparison , would have cost an estimated $215,605 . In that case , moving the home in one piece would have been more cost effective . <p> The Carney Island site also is more preferable in that it sets the home up for historic designations as it is already secured by a park ranger station and is already Marion County-owned land , according to Couillard and the committees report . <p> " Ma " Barker and her son , who made up part of the notorious Barker-Karpis gang in the 1930s , began renting the home in late 1934 while on the run following a high-profile kidnapping in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ false name " Blackburn " before the FBI caught up with them on Jan. 16 , 1935 . <p> The home still bears bulletholes from that gun battle , now plastered over in most cases .

Those early ones , among them " Lock , Stock and Two Smoking Barrels , " " Snatch , " and " RocknRolla , " show off an urgent , kinetic , humorous energy . The later ones , including a couple of Robert Downey-starring Sherlock Holmes entries as well as an attempted reboot of " The Man from U.N.C.L.E . " did more of the same but had lots more effects . His track record contains art house darlings , box office bonanzas and as far as " U.N.C.L.E . ( and his rarely mentioned " Swept Away " ) , disasters . But you can always recognize a Ritchie film because of his cinematic vocabulary : Fast talking , rapid-fire editing , and an often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Legend of the Sword , " Ritchie , 48 , adds the dimension of historical epic to the mix . The result is one curious hybrid . He spoke about it last week in New York . <p> Q : Before you made features , you did commercials , then music videos , then short films . What triggered your desire to be a director ? A : I guess it was innate . When I was 15 , I was the first person in the UK to get a GCSE ( General Certificate of Secondary Education ) in film studies . Then I was absolutely useless at anything else ; I had no advantages in any academic respect . Then I sort of drifted off into a misspent youth , but when I was 25 , one of my friends was making a commercial , and I came in as a runner ( an assistant ) for that . It was impossible to get into the film industry in the UK because it was dead there at the time . The only way of getting to anything was in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once I found that as an in , I was off to the races . I came up the hard way through the ranks , which of course I 'm tremendously grateful for , because you learn everything . You struggle , and you start making short films , but you start learning your craft and developing your voice and building up some confidence . <p> Q : Are you a longtime fan of the story of King Arthur ? A : My experience of the Arthurian legend is first and foremost by John Boormans film ( " Excalibur " ) , which I found very provocative and exciting , when I was 10 . I suppose that influenced me to the point where I was desperate to make a version of it myself . <p> Q : So how long have you been kicking around this version ? A : I wrote it about 5or 6 years ago . The problem with the legend is how dense it is . When Joby Harold came in as a co-screenwriter , he brought a fantasy aspect to it , and he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rid of some of the iconic characters and leaving them for another episode . So as soon as you get rid of eight of the 10 components , and focus on two of them , all of a sudden you 've got a narrative you can follow . <p> Q : You just mentioned another episode . Do you have more films about the legend planned ? A : I 'm not sure . But as of right now I 'd very much like to make another one . <p> Q : Could you say a few words of introduction about some of your major characters : King Arthur , the villain Vortigern , and the mysterious woman called the Mage ? A : Arthur ( Charlie Hunnam ) is an individual from aristocratic origins , immersed into the filth of a brothel , where he experiences love , and then begrudgingly stumbles into the position of becoming the king of England . Vortigern ( Jude Law ) is a man who is convinced that mans desire is for ascension and power , that man is in a race and a competition with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ game as far as he s concerned , so hell do anything he can to get it , without shame . The Mage ( Astrid Berges-Frisbey ) deals in natural law and the manipulation of it . So the ability to speak to animals is her strongest talent . <p> Q : Is it easier or more challenging to have a bigger budget to make a movie ? A : Well , in the respect that having come from a place where you had to keep your vision restricted , in a sense , for obvious reasons , to getting to a point where someone says no , no , you can put your hand in the cookie jar and you 're encouraged to take all the cookies , that 's nice . I have to say that being a film director , well , I could n't think of a more pleasurable job . I 'd do it for free .

Using 13 relevant criteria , they evaluated the 200 largest metropolitan areas in the United States and ranked Ocala as the 200th best place ( that is , the worst place ) to raise children . <p> The statistics came from credible sources and covered five areas health , education , economic , environmental and social . <p> Besides the Ocala ranking , the report noted that of the 10 cities ranked from 190 to 200 , six were in Florida . The highest-ranked city in Florida was at No. 157 ( Melbourne ) . This says that not only do we in Marion County have work to do but also we as a state need to reconsider our priorities . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If a company were considering a move to Ocala , how would they regard the study ? My conclusion is that while we should not throw up our hands in despair , we need to look at the information and commit to improving this aspect of our community . <p> At the same time we can celebrate our strengths as they pertain to children . One example is the myriad opportunities for year-round outdoor recreational activities . <p> There is always talk about a concern for children and their welfare , but why should we care about them ? Let me offer two reasons . <p> First children are vulnerable individuals unable to raise themselves , and as a society we have committed to insuring that they are nurtured to adulthood . While parents have the primary responsibility for child-rearing , society has an obligation as well . Education is just one example of a societal responsibility . <p> The second reason is an acknowledgement and understanding of the fact that todays children are Ocalas future and this future will be here in the next 20 years . These young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Board and the city councils . They will be the community leaders . Others will be leaders in the business sector determining the economic vitality of Marion County . Then other young people will serve as teachers , nurses , plumbers , utility workers , etc. impacting the lives on a daily basis of us all . <p> So what is the solution ? I do n't  have a specific plan to offer . Even now we are not ignoring our children , but as a community we have to accept that our children are not being sufficiently served and begin looking for ways to bring improvement . <p> If other communities have provided a better environment for children , we need to find out what they are doing and attempt to replicate their successes . It may be for us that education of our community will be the key . This could lead to greater volunteerism on the part of more of our citizens . Also , it will require leadership from our elected local officials in the form of being at the table when the problems are being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well-being of children to a higher priority . More business leaders will need to give of their expertise , time and resources when asked . <p> While greater funding will be necessary , it is not just about money . <p> There is no easy fix . Time will be required to correct our deficiencies and shortcomings . <p> But we live in a great city and have the ability to bring change that will improve the future for our children and leave us as a better community . <p> Dr. Mike Jordan is a retired physician and the longtime executive director of the Marion County Childrens Alliance .

Avoid monthly maintenance fees <p> Using multiple savings accounts can be more of a burden than a bonus if you 're hit with monthly maintenance fees . If you belong to a bank that charges these fees and would rather stay put , there are ways to avoid getting dinged . Options include keeping balances above a certain dollar amount or scheduling automatic transfers between checking and savings accounts . <p> 2 . Lock in strong rates <p> Although avoiding monthly fees should be a priority , securing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and credit unions tend to offer higher APYs than traditional brick-and-mortar banks , which makes them ideal for multiple savings accounts . <p> Look at it this way : Keeping $5,000 at a bank that offers a 0.01% APY would earn an annual yield of just 50 cents . An APY of 1.05% , on the other hand , would earn about $50 " not enough to quit your job , but a welcomed addition to that emergency fund . <p> 3 . Use nicknames to personalize accounts <p> The banks and credit unions listed above let people nickname their accounts based on what their savings goals are . ( You can name these accounts whatever you 'd like , but we would recommend keeping it simple " try ' vacation fund , ' ' emergency fund ' or ' new dishwasher fund . ' ) <p> These nicknames are typically private , so you will be able to see them when banking online but they wo n't show up on external transfers . It would n't hurt to check with your bank just to be sure . <p> 4 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unions limit the number of savings accounts people can open . What 's more , some put limits on the number of accounts folks can open during the initial application process . However , customers might be able to call the bank or credit union later and open additional accounts . Policies vary from bank to bank , so be sure to check in to get a better idea of their rules . <p> No matter how many accounts you have at a bank , make sure you wo n't get hit with surprise fees for excessive withdrawals " federal banking regulations generally limit holders of savings accounts to six such transactions a month per account . Each account should be treated separately , but confirming that with your bank is a good idea . <p> As with any financial decision , there is no one-size-fits-all answer to where you should open multiple savings accounts . But by exploring your options and keeping the above tips in mind , you should be able to set yourself up for success .

The reader also noticed that the floor area was blackened , perhaps with mold or mildew , and asked if this is cause for alarm , and also for suggestions on how to handle it . Though it seems odd to find mushrooms on the second floor of a home , I , too , have seen mushrooms growing in diverse places . I saw one growing on the bottom panel of an overhead garage door , and another time I saw one growing out of the carpeting of a new home .

The simplest solution would be to get rid of the water or to try to keep the wood as dry as possible . That may sound easy , but the flooring outside a bathroom is continuously subjected to wet feet , soaked towels and high humidity . Have your relative check the plumbing fixtures for leaks . When showering , close the doors or curtains , and dry off inside the shower or on a mat , not on the floor of the bathroom . Do not leave used towels , washcloths or wet clothing where they can soak the floor . Check the toilet bowl to make sure it 's tightly secured to the floor . Facing the toilet , use your knees ( one on either side of the bowl ) to gently rock the bowl side to side . If the bowl moves at all , then you need to replace the wax ring used as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A loose connection at the wax ring can lead to a slow but steady leak . This type of seepage often goes unnoticed , but eventually the leak will stain or damage the bathroom floor or the finished ceiling of rooms below . Loose toilet bowls need to be repaired by a qualified plumber to prevent damage to the bowl and to ensure a proper seal . It is also very important to use the bath fan when showering or bathing . The purpose of the fan is to vent humidity to the exterior of the home . The humidity that escapes under the bathroom door can elevate the moisture levels of the wood floor , which in turn feeds the fungi . Remove the mushroom and treat the area with a mixture of one part household bleach to three parts warm water . Work in a well-ventilated area . Next , attack the stains around the mushroom . The stains are most likely caused by moisture mixing with the water-soluble tannic acid present in the wood flooring . Tannic acid gives certain species of wood their resistance to decay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As the wood 's fibers become saturated , a solution of tannic acid rises to the surface , where it then dries through evaporation . As the water evaporates , the tannic acid residue is left behind to stain the wood 's finished surface . The longer the residue is left to dry , the harder it will be to remove the stains . Make a paste of oxalic acid and water , and rub it into the stains with a soft cloth . The paste will break down the adhesion of the tannic acid residue to where it can be removed with a clean towel . Rinse and dry thoroughly .

Default rates are more than 11% , and based on recent research those numbers might be understated . Student loans should be the last option when funding an education . However , they appear to be the first option for many people . <p> The good news is that each family can develop its own strategy to pay for college , one that reduces the reliance on student loans and the overall cost of an education .

College Navigator is a great resource for assessing this . If a school finds your child academically desirable , he or she is more likely to be accepted and awarded financial aid in the form of grants and scholarships . <p> Community colleges are also an excellent option , as they can offer quality education and flexibility at a fraction of the cost of most other schools . <p> After you find schools where your child will likely be accepted , you will need to determine your eligibility for financial aid .

There are legal ways to dodge the IRS , at least for a while , and one of the best is to stuff as much of that $100,000 as possible into tax-favored retirement savings accounts . <p> Employer-sponsored retirement plans , like a 401(k) or 403(b) , and individual retirement accounts , like Roth or traditional IRAs , can help shield tens of thousands of your dollars from taxes . And with $100,000 at your disposal , you can afford to max out both a 401(k) and an IRA if you 're eligible . If you 're under age 50 , that comes to $23,500 a year ( $18,000 for the 401(k) and up to $5,500 for an IRA ) . It 's $30,500 for those age 50 and older when you add in the catch-up contributions ( an extra $6,000 in a 401(k) and $1,000 for an IRA ) . <p> Even after maxing out your workplace plan and IRA , you 've still got roughly $70,000 of that $100,000 to work with .

Consider that in 2016 the average monthly benefit for a retired couple who both receive Social Security benefits was $2,212 , according to the Social Security Administration . <p> Investing the remaining $70,000 windfall and earning a 6% average annual return would mean an extra $300,000 in 25 years " the kind of padding that makes it less likely you 'll run out of money and have to move in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retirement calculator to see how extra dollars affect when you can retire and how much monthly income you 'll have in the future . <p> 4 .

Now there 's even more of your money at stake . <p> Investing fees are like a distant relative you helped out that one time who now hounds you for bigger and bigger handouts .

Resist the urge to make a major strategy shift <p> Do n't scrap your existing asset allocation plan ( that carefully crafted pie chart indicating how much of your money is in cash , bonds , stocks , real estate , etc. ) in order to accommodate new money . Unless you 're in the midst of a major life change , such as retirement or liquidating assets for an upcoming expense , changes to the current makeup of your portfolio and your risk tolerance profile are probably unnecessary . <p> But with this new money in hand , now 's a good time to review where you are : <p> Take an asset allocation snapshot .

Because you 're not taxed on investment growth , it makes sense to hold investments that generate taxable income ( such as corporate bond funds , high-growth stocks or mutual funds that buy and sell a lot ) in these accounts . Even better if you can hold them in Roth versions of these accounts , where withdrawals in retirement are tax-free .

Some prominent operators of charter schools announced that they were n't happy with the plan . <p> Trump and his education secretary , Betsy DeVos , have said their top priority in education is expanding school choice , and Trump 's 2018 budget proposal calls for a $168 million increase for charter schools , a 50 percent funding increase . It is also possible that the administration will push for a first-ever federal tax credit program that would steer public money into private schools . Such programs exist now in a number of states and DeVos has repeatedly called a Florida tax-credit program a model for the nation . <p> Under the draft budget , the 14 percent proposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for , among other things , teacher training , after-school programs , and aid to low-income and minority college students . Trump would spend $1.4 billion on school choice initiatives , including charters . <p> Leaders of more than 20 charter school networks signed onto a recent op-ed in USA Today , which says that they do n't want the money if it comes at the expense of important programs that help students in traditional public schools . They wrote : " We see charters as an important part of a much broader effort to revitalize public education in America . Already , in cities such as New York , Denver , St. Louis and Houston , we see ourselves as partners , not competitors , with traditional school districts . These partnerships , we hope , will only grow in the future . <p> " But to make that broader vision work , we need federal support for all schools , for all kids , not just kids in ' choice ' schools . " <p> The authors of the piece are Dacia Toll , co-chief executive officer of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York , Connecticut and Rhode Island ; Richard Barth , chief executive officer of the KIPP Foundation , a network of charter schools in numerous states , including Maryland , New York , Texas , California , North Carolina , Illinois , Colorado and Ohio , as well as in the District of Columbia ; and Brett Peiser , chief executive officer of Uncommon Schools , a charter network in New York , New Jersey and Massachusetts . <p> And Greg Richmond , president of the National Association of Charter School Authorizers , released a separate statement saying : " We support and appreciate an increase in federal funding for charter schools . All families deserve the opportunity to choose a school that best meets the needs of their children . However , we are deeply concerned about proposed cuts to other important education programs , as charter schools are part of - not a substitute for - a strong public education system . Charter schools can not succeed without strong teachers and a seamless , affordable path to college for their graduates . Unfortunately , this proposed budget harms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public education . We look forward to working with Congress to finds ways to support both charter schools and all of public education . " <p> But some charter school advocates are delighted about Trump 's proposed budget , highlighting an important split in the school choice community . Nina Rees , president and chief executive officer of the National Alliance for Public Charter Schools , said in a statement : <p> " President Trump demonstrated that he is a strong supporter of charter public schools . The charter school movement is grateful for the president 's support , and we applaud his commitment to providing critically needed funding for the Charter Schools Program ( CSP ) . This funding will allow more high-quality charter schools to open , expand , and replicate - and will help finance facilities for charter schools - so that more students have access to the great education they deserve . " <p> The difference of opinion among charter operators underscores the variety of opinions they have about just how far policymakers should take school choice . Some charter operators oppose using public money for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and tax-credit programs do . Charter schools are publicly funded but privately operated ; some of them get substantial financial help from philanthropists and foundations . <p> Public school advocates who oppose or want to limit charter schools say that too many charters use public money without being held accountable to the public . They are furious about Trump 's education budget proposal . <p> Jeff Bryant , an associate fellow at Campaign for America 's Future editor of the Education Opportunity Network , notes in this Common Creams piece : " The way the Trump administration is spinning this combination of funding cuts and increases - and the way nearly every news outlet is reporting them - is that there is some sort of strategically important balance between funding programs for poor kids versus " school choice " schemes , as if the two are equivalents and just different means to the same ends . Nothing could be further from the truth The message being spun out of Trump 's education budget is that it takes money away from those awful " adult interests " - like , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so students have somewhere to go after school to play sports , get tutored , or engage in music and art projects - to steer money to " the kids " who will get a meager sum of money to search for learning opportunities in an education system that is increasingly bereft of teachers and buildings . <p> " Even competent education reporters are falling for this spin , writing that education policy is experiencing a " sea change in focus from fixing the failing schools to helping the students in the failing schools . <p> " However , there 's evidence that federally funded efforts like after-school programs and class size reduction tend to lead to better academic results for low-income children , while the case for using school choice programs to address the education needs of poor kids is pretty weak .

I tried ramming a broom handle down the hose , I tried vigorously shaking the hose , banging it against a concrete surface and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have in the shed . Nothing seemed to work very well . It would take an hour , sometimes more , to get the hose cleared . <p> Then , one day , I remembered reading somewhere that a geologist had said water was an excellent solvent .

It may take it quite some time to do it , but given enough time , water can erode some pretty hard material . So , with that thought in mind , the next time the hose on the vacuum became hopelessly clogged I detached it , took it outside and filled it to the brim with water .

I then hung the hose up to drain dry . <p> Solution time for the problem : about five minutes , not counting the drying-out procedure . <p> Five minutes of mild work sure beats the pants off a full hour of thrusting , twisting , wrenching , cursing and shaking a stupid hose , believe me . <p> I generally let the hose hang up overnight to thoroughly drip dry , but it probably does n't  take nearly that long . <p> Sure is easier on the old nerves , too ! <p> MS CURE ? : Ocalas Tom Lee wrote : " In your Oct. 10 column , you cite Theresa Grimes horrific cost for her multiple sclerosis medications .

@@97886926 @2086926/ <h> The presidency is about to change - as Trump remains Trump <p> WASHINGTON Donald Trump enters the White House on Friday just as he entered the race for president : defiant , unfiltered , unbound by tradition and utterly confident in his chosen course . <p> In the 10 weeks since his surprise election as the nation 's 45th president , Trump has violated decades of established diplomatic protocol , sent shockwaves through business boardrooms , tested long-standing ethics rules and continued his combative style of replying to any slight with a personal attack on Twitter and in person . <p> Past presidents have described walking into the Oval Office for the first time as a humbling experience , one that in an instant makes clear the weight of their new role as caretaker of American democracy . Trump spent much of his transition making clear he sees things differently : Rather than change for the office , he argues , the office will change for him . <p> " They say it 's not presidential to call up these massive leaders of business , " Trump told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he negotiated a deal with an air conditioning company to keep jobs in the state , a move many economists derided as unworkable national economic policy . <p> Even before he takes the oath of office , Trump has changed the very nature of presidency , breaking conventions and upending expectations for the leader of the free world . <p> Advisers who 've spoken with Trump say the billionaire real estate mogul and reality TV star is aware of the historic nature of his new job . He 's told friends that he 's drawn to the ambition of Ronald Reagan , a Republican , and John F. Kennedy , a Democrat . He 's thinking of spending his first night in the White House sleeping in the Lincoln Bedroom , according to some who dined with him recently in Florida . <p> But Trump also views himself as a kind of " sui generis " president , beholden to no one for his success and modeling himself after no leader who 's come before . Trump has said he 's read no biographies of former presidents . When asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he mentioned his father before replying that he did n't " like the concept of heroes . " <p> " I do n't think Trump has a great sense of the history of the White House . When you do n't know your history , it 's hard to fully respect the traditions , " said historian Douglas Brinkley , who recently dined with Trump and other guests at his South Florida club . " This is not somebody who brags about how many history biographies he 's read . " <p> " He 's somebody who brags about it as this is a big event and he 's the maestro , " he said . <p> That 's a shift that thrills his supporters , who elected Trump to shake up what they see as an unresponsive and corrupt federal government in the " swamp " of Washington . <p> " I do n't want him to change " said Iowa state Sen. Brad Zaun , one of Trump 's earliest backers . " One of the reasons that I supported him is that he told it the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He did n't do the standard political talking points . " <p> Trump won election with that approach , but he 's yet to win over the country . His Electoral College victory was tempered by a loss in the popular vote to Democrat Hillary Clinton by nearly 3 million ballots . The protests planned for the day after his inauguration threaten to draw more people to the National Mall than his official events . <p> Polls over the past week show that Trump is poised to enter the White House as the least popular president in four decades . Democrats remain staunchly opposed to him , independents have not rallied behind him and even Republicans are less enthusiastic than might be expected , according to the surveys . <p> In his typical reaction to poll results he does n't like , Trump dismissed them as " rigged " in a Tuesday tweet . <p> It 's exactly that kind of tweet that worries governing experts , lawmakers and other critics , who argue that traditional practices of the presidency protect the health of the American democracy . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ culture in which presidents largely respect a series of unwritten rules that help democracy and the rule of law flourish , " said Brendan Nyhan , a professor of government at Dartmouth College . " What 's striking about Trump is he flouts norms that have previously been respected by both parties on a daily basis . He calls things into question that have never been questioned before . " <p> Since winning the election , Trump has attacked Hollywood celebrities , civil rights icons and political rivals alike . He 's moved markets by going after some companies , while praising others . <p> He 's questioned the legitimacy of American institutions appearing to trust the word of Russian President Vladimir Putin over the intelligence agencies he 'll soon oversee , engaging in personal fights with journalists as he assails the free press and questioning the results of the election , even though it put him in office . <p> And he 's lambasted the leaders of longstanding allied nations as he questions the post-World War II international order that won the Cold War and maintained peace in Europe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ style is the very reason he won their votes . But for others in the country , it 's a type of leadership they 've seen before and fear will spread . <p> They point to Maine , where a Trump-like governor has roiled the state 's government with offensive statements , a combative style and little respect for the Legislature , as a warning of what the nation might expect during a Trump administration . <p> Gov . Paul LePage 's confrontational brand of politics has made it harder to pass legislation , build political coalitions or even conduct the basic workings of state government , say legislators and political consultants in the traditionally centrist state . He 's created rifts with would-be Republican allies , demonized the media and tightly controlled basic information . At times , he 's banned the heads of state agencies from appearing before legislative committees , making state budgeting and oversight difficult . <p> " What I 'm concerned about nationally is what we 've seen up here that the checks and balances we take for granted disappear , " said Lance Dutson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elected before later speaking out against him . " There are things that are happening up here that I really thought just could n't happen . " <p> There are signs that Trump 's actions are already changing the traditions of government in Washington , freeing lawmakers and other officials from long-respected practices of federal politics . <p> More than 50 House Democrats plan to boycott Trump 's inauguration ceremony , an unprecedented break with the bipartisan tradition of celebrating the peaceful transfer of power . While many Democrats were furious with the outcome of the 2000 election in which Republican George W. Bush defeated Al Gore after recounts and a Supreme Court ruling , they generally attended Bush 's inauguration ceremony . <p> " I will not celebrate a man who preaches a politics of division and hate , " tweeted Keith Ellison , a Minnesota congressman who 's bidding to head the Democratic National Committee . <p> Those who know Trump say the billionaire mogul delights in confounding establishment expectations , even as he craves approval from powerbrokers in New York and Washington . <p> " He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is very much the guy from Queens who looked across at Manhattan and envied but also to some degree hated the elites who occupied Manhattan , " said Michael D'Antonio , author of " Never Enough , " a Trump biography . " The way that he wants to disrupt institutions reflects this idea that the institutions have n't embraced him . " <p> That 's a style that may work better for a CEO of a family corporation who has little oversight from corporate boards or shareholders than a president constrained by a system of checks and balances . Former Cabinet officials say the layers of government bureaucracy , myriad regulations and intricacies of Congress will challenge Trump 's style . <p> " A president does n't have sweeping , universal authority . It is a very different operation than being a CEO who can fire people and hire people at will , " said Kathleen Sebelius , a Democrat and former health and human services secretary . " He 's never been part of any organization with a framework where institutional rules are in place . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ publicly and privately , said he 's urged the president-elect to hold onto some of the traditions of the office . <p> " The one thing I 've said to him directly , and I would advise my Republican friends in Congress and supporters around the country , is just make sure that as we go forward certain norms , certain institutional traditions do n't get eroded , because there 's a reason they 're in place , " said Obama , in a recent interview with CBS ' " 60 Minutes . " <p> But Trump 's supporters say it 's the institutions and Washington and not the next president that must change . <p> " Trump believes that he has a better understanding of how things work in the modern world than all of these so-called critics , " said Newt Gingrich , a Trump adviser and former Republican House speaker , who has spoken with the president-elect about his presidency .

Hicks , 29 , and other " Idol " finalists edging near 30 are testing the limits of just how old an aspiring pop star can be and still gain acceptance from the music industry and the public - while the TV contest reaps the rewards of showcasing older performers . The top-rated Fox show is attracting a bigger audience than ever in its fifth edition as it offers a wider range of talent , which producers say is why they raised the audition age limit from 24 to 28 last year .

No one gets a free pass , and unique talent trumps everything else . " There are examples of singers who are beyond the Clearasil years making a splash . At age 28 , James Blunt of Britain became music 's latest hot property with the hit ballad " You 're Beautiful , " which was a mainstay on American adult contemporary formats before crossing over to top 40 radio . Mariah Carey , 36 , had her biggest hit yet with her comeback album , " The Emancipation of Mimi .

The latest album from Barry Manilow , 59 , was holding its own on the charts this month , hovering right above the Black Eyed Peas , while Tony Bennett , 79 , has put out best-selling records in recent years . In an appearance on " American Idol , " Manilow threw his weight behind the veterans , calling Hicks " one of the best male vocalists you have on the show " and suggesting he might hire Mandisa if the contest did n't pan out for her .

" <p> Bear hunting has been a controversial issue since the commission in 2015 allowed the first bear hunt in more than 20 years . The commission decided against holding a hunt in 2016 . <p> Animal-rights supporters consider such hunts as trophy excursions and question the agency 's bear population numbers . <p> " The bear population is so fragmented , and there are so many bears hit by cars , we should be conserving them and helping connect the different subpopulations with safe passages over interstates and things like that , " said Kate MacFall of the Humane Society of the United States .

" The number of nuisance calls is down . It 's well known the number of bear conflicts , where there is a result of injuries , is way down . It 's working . There is no reason why they should even contemplate even having a hunt if what they 're doing is working . " <p> After 304 bears were killed in two days during the 2015 hunt , the commission narrowly rejected a hunt last year . The decision was to give the agency more time to build a case for future hunts and to provide more time for non-lethal efforts to reduce human-bear conflicts to take hold . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fees paid for bear hunting permits in 2015 to spread $825,000 across 12 counties Seminole , Lake , Orange , Santa Rosa , Collier , Franklin , Gulf , Leon , Marion , Putnam , Volusia and Wakulla to increase the use of bear-proof trash containers . <p> Also , after the 2015 hunt , the agency completed a population estimate that raised the number of bears in the state from just over 3,000 to 4,350 . <p> " A growing bear population is good to see , " Eason said . " A lot of us have worked hard to recover bears in Florida . They continue to do well , and that is why we are looking at all aspects of bear management . " <p> The staff update comes as the number of bear-related calls has fallen from 6,688 in 2014 to 6,088 in 2015 and 5,132 last year , according to the state agency . <p> In February , Eason advised state lawmakers that a number of factors could be involved in the reductions in calls : an abundance of natural foods that would make bears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2015 and 2016 to relocate about 100 bears that were generating the most calls ; and the impact of a 2015 hunt and the public reaction to the hunt . <p> " There 's been strong reaction to the bear hunt , " Eason told members of the House Agriculture &amp; Natural Resources Appropriations Subcommittee . " We definitely get reports that people are not calling in when they maybe would have in the past . " <p> Jacki Lopez , the Center for Biological Diversity 's Florida director , noted that a recent Colorado Parks and Wildlife study found that an increase in bear-human conflicts was more a sign that the creatures adapted to urban expansion into their habitats rather than a growth in population . <p> " It supports our position that if the real reason for a hunt is to address a growing so-called problem bear population , hunting is not the correct tool to address that problem , " Lopez said in an email .

The bill unveiled Wednesday would not do that . <p> And Sen.

But in addition to running her business here in rural northeast Marion County , Glorius also spends a lot of time in Tallahassee and on the phone these days , lobbying on behalf of herself and her fellow independent pharmacists . <p> The issue , simply put , is that Medicaid , the state-federal health insurance program for the poor , is shifting its Florida members to large pharmacy chains to meet their medication needs . That is a problem for independent pharmacies and , often times , the clients they serve . <p> Glorius is a prime example . She has operated Grandmas Country Pharmacy on County Road 316 since July 1999 . Many of her clients are enrolled in Medicaid . The nearest chain pharmacy is 16 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reliable transportation to get there . <p> When her Medicaid-enrolled clients are shifted onto a drug plan that only recognizes the big chains , they must drive right past her store to go into town and visit a place that may or may not even have what they need . <p> " I 'm the only pharmacy in that whole Zip code , " Glorius said , referring to a map of 32134 , which covers the Ocala National Forest . <p> Glorius and her fellow independent pharmacists are n't  looking for a handout . They are willing to accept the same reimbursement as the chains and meet the same requirements that they meet . They just want to be an option on the Medicaid plans . Glorius needs this to stay in business . And many of her clients need it , as well , to have a realistic access to pharmaceutical services . <p> That 's why Glorius and the Florida Pharmacy Association support Senate Bill 670 , which is trying to give small , family-owned businesses an opportunity to continue serving their communities . The bills key passage : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pharmacy that meets the credentialing requirements , complies with agency standards , and accepts the terms of the plan . The managed care plan must offer the same rate of reimbursement to all pharmacies in the plans network . " <p> Unfortunately for Glorius and her allies , there are strong forces working against the bill . Managed care plans say that , to negotiate competitive drug prices , they need to be assured of patient volume . If Senate Bill 670 becomes law , they say , there will be a short-term fix for mom-and-pop pharmacies but also a long-term problem for Medicaid in general , as cost savings would be reduced . <p> The Legislature is in the process of sorting this out . Last month , Glorius testified in front of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Health and Human Services and the Senate Banking and Insurance Committee . She likely will be back in Tallahassee again before session ends . Meanwhile , the House companion bill ( HB 625 ) has been assigned to a subcommittee but has n't  seen any action . <p> The story really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a managed care model . ( There are 4 million enrollees today . ) The number of providers shrank and costs , according to the plan managers , were contained . In 2015 , Florida began allowing for limited networks using the managed care model . <p> Glorius has been a pharmacist since 1998 and opened her business one year later . She accepted Medicaid and had no problems . <p> Two years ago , the managed care networks started closing . Glorius was shut out of the Staywell plan , and 53 percent of her business evaporated overnight . <p> " Struggling was an understatement , " Glorius said during a recent interview . <p> The shift to chain pharmacies might make sense in urban areas . But in rural Fort McCoy the systems one-size-fits-all absurdities were on display . <p> One of Glorius former clients just stopped taking her medicine and wound up in the hospital . The client complained and the managed care organization agreed to pay for taxi rides to and from the chain pharmacy . The taxi drove right past Grandmas Country Pharmacy . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ code 32134 . He is in Staywell ; Grandmas was n't . " We cant take care of our own clients in the same community , " Glorius told the Senate subcommittee . <p> After publicizing her complaints , Glorius was put back onto Staywell in early March . But the bigger problem persists for her and other independent pharmacies . State Sen. Aaron Bean , R-Jacksonville , said 257 pharmacies , in virtually every sector of the state , shut down last year due to network closures and limited access to independent pharmacy contracts . <p> Bean , who introduced SB 670 , said he s in an odd posture . He supports Floridas move to Medicaid managed care and typically takes up for the health programs themselves . Bean understands that , to negotiate competitive prices , programs need to be assured of volume . That is good for them and good for the state as a whole . <p> He said he wants to " find the happy ground where we protect our pharmacies " but also preserve the integrity and market power of managed care . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ choice of two pharmacies down the road , " he told the Senate subcommittee . " We want to bring back choice and competition and have a fair , balanced and healthy managed care program . " <p> That balance might be difficult to achieve . A Senate staff analysis says that requiring Medicaid managed care plans to contract with any willing pharmacy that meets the requirements for participation may indeed " offer patients greater choice and convenience in the selection of pharmacies . " <p> However , " absent the promise of exclusivity of network providers , the bargaining power of the larger Medicaid managed care plans may be weakened , " the analysis adds . " Providers may have less incentive to offer substantial discounts to plans , possibly resulting in higher costs to the plans , which may be passed through to the capitation rate setting process . " <p> What would " higher costs " look like ? Audrey Brown , president and CEO of the Florida Association of Health Plans , predicts an $80 million impact . <p> " This impacts the entire marketplace " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Senate subcommittee . <p> " How do you know " how much cost savings might be lost , he asked during an interview .

He further notes that , five years ago , he and his association predicted the problems that independent pharmacies and their clients would experience as provider networks became increasingly restricted . <p> " We hoped that we would be wrong , " Jackson said . <p> Another factor working against the independent pharmacies : " Because this change may result in larger provider networks , the plans may need to deploy additional strategies to monitor against fraud , waste , and abuse . These additional responsibilities may have a fiscal impact on the managed care plans . The fiscal impact of the proposed changes will have an indeterminate impact on managed care plans , but if significant , the additional administrative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rate setting process , " the Senate staff analysis says . <p> Into all this high technical discussion walks Glorius , an affable but serious woman who , despite her business name , it not a grandmother .

It 's a tradition , everyone believes , that is worth saving . <p> " She delivers when she has to . She takes care of her customers .

He was sentenced to death in May 1981 . <p> Since September 1981 , Lightbourne 's appeals and challenges of his sentence have been denied repeatedly by the Florida Supreme Court and other levels of court . <p> Thursday 's hearing was based on a precedent put in place by Hurst v. Florida in 2016 . The U.S. Supreme Court ruled that Florida 's death sentencing practice , which only required a majority jury vote in favor of the death penalty , was unconstitutional . Later in the year , the Florida Supreme Court determined that a unanimous vote for the death penalty was required . In March of this year , Gov .

The Supreme Court handed down an order based on those hearings in January 2003 , according to court documents . <p> Lightbourne 's attorneys focused on this technicality and what would be fundamentally fair in his case to argue their point . <p> " It is fundamentally unfair that defendants similarly situated will get the benefit of Hurst where others would n't , " Houston said . By benefits , she meant the ability to be resentenced . <p> But the state 's argument , presented by Popoola , focused on the fact that Lightbourne 's case had been decided way before the cutoff date and should therefore stand . <p> " The fundamental fairness argument has no hold " in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who listened to both sides , seemed to favor the state 's argument . <p> " Every time a court makes a decision on retroactivity , there 's always a line drawn somewhere unless you say , ' we reset the rule for everybody , ' " he said . <p> The defense assured Hodges they were not arguing for a new trial , but a new sentencing . In Lightbourne 's original sentencing , no jury count was recorded . It was simply entered into court records that the majority decision was that he should receive the death penalty . <p> Without a numerical count , Houston said , there is no way to know whether the decision was unanimous and a resentencing would be able to settle that . <p> " When you look ( at the case ) now , it ca n't possibly be said that at least one juror would not have voted for life , " Keffer said . <p> Keffer and Houston kept referring to the law that Lightbourne 's fate was decided under as unconstitutional , but Popoola reminded the judge multiple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Many of the arguments rested on perspective and interpretation of the new ruling and retroactivity . While the defense wanted Hodges to be more lenient in the definition of retroactivity and fairness , the state asked him to stick to the definitions put in place by state law . <p> Hodges did not rule on the motion to vacate Lightbourne 's death penalty at the hearing , but warned Keffer and Houston he would probably deny their motion . <p> " The Supreme Court has been very specific , " he said . <p> He told both teams of attorneys that he would consider all the arguments he heard and would write an order with his ruling next week . <p> Lightbourne is one of eight Marion County murderers on death row .

" The White House grounds was the best location to safeguard the proper chain of custody and classification of these documents , so the chairman could view them in a legal way . " <p> Nunes would not name the source of the information , nor would he disclose who invited him on the White House grounds for the meeting .

His actions look like those of someone who is interested in protecting the president and his party , " Schumer said . <p> House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi said , " Chairman Nunes ' discredited behavior has tarnished that office , " and said Ryan should insist that Nunes " at least recuse himself " from the Russia probe . <p> AshLee Strong , a spokeswoman for Ryan , said Monday the speaker has " full confidence that Chairman Nunes is conducting a thorough , fair and credible investigation .

Maybe its purely financial , maybe its a question of maintenance , or maybe you 've had a change in family status , but whatever the reason , you think your current vehicle is n't cutting it any longer.So how do you decide when its time to pull the trigger on a new car ? I Hate This Stupid Car " I 'm thinking about unloading my much-despised 2010 SUV , " my friend Julia wrote me a few months back . " Its a vehicle I never wouldve chosen , but I let myself get strong-armed into it by an opportunistic and very talented salesman .

Its almost guaranteed that you 're going to lose money in a transaction.According to Chron.com , a good rule of thumb is that your brand-new car will lose 10 percent of its value the moment you sign the paperwork , and another 10 by the end of the first year . Then , it will continue to lose 15 percent of its value per year.Factor in things like sales tax and more expensive insurance on a newer car , and getting yourself out of the car you hate can cost you thousands.The Argument for Cutting it LooseWell , you hate it . No matter how much money you 're going to lose , if you cringe every single time you write a check for your car payment , and you find yourself looking in the other direction to avoid seeing your car in a parking lot , nothing in the world is going to make it any better .

Shes now driving a certified pre-owned crossover that meets her needs and makes her happy.Gas Prices Have Gone Up $1.35For the last couple of years we 've been enjoying historically low gasoline prices , especially when adjusted for inflation . Recent data show that many Americans jump into the same ginormous SUVs and pickups that were nailed to the showroom floor in 2008 , when we were paying close to four bucks a gallon for gas.You know as well as we do that gas prices are going to go up again , though , and as soon as they do , manufacturers will blow the dust off the EVs and hybrids languishing in showrooms , and charge a premium for anything that gets 50 miles per gallon-plus.The Argument for Keeping ItThe EPA makes this one pretty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a handy cost calculator that will give you a pretty good estimate of your fuel cost savings per year , based on how many miles you drive.Lets say you 're driving one of Americas most popular cars , the 2013 Toyota Camry with a V6 , and you 're considering trading it on a 2017 Toyota Prius Three . At 15,000 miles per year , with gas prices set at a high $3.50 per gallon , youd save about $1,100 per year in fuel costs.But what 's it going to cost to get into a Prius ? A 2013 Camry V6 with average mileage is worth around $12,000 . A 2017 Toyota Prius Three is $26,735 . You 're spending $14,735 to save $1,100 a year in fuel , not including the sales tax , insurance , licensing fees and other associated costs with getting a new car . It would take 13 years to make up the difference in fuel cost between the Camry and the Prius . <p> The Argument for Getting Rid of ItNow let 's compare a 2013 Chevrolet Suburban with a 17 mpg combined average , versus a 2017 Toyota @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a 15,000 mile per year average , with gas prices set at $3.50 per gallon , you 'll spend $2,100 more per year in fuel for the Suburban . Over five years , that 's $10,500 . Its a ton of money.How about what its going to cost to flip the Suburban ? Average trade-in value for a loaded 4WD Suburban is $32,462 . Average value for a 2017 Toyota Prius Three is $26,735 . On a good day , you could walk out of a transaction like that with a check in your pocket , and a savings of $2,100 per year in fuel costs.The Final AnswerIt depends on the cars in question , the costs , the price of fuel and the market , but in general , swapping out an average car for a hybrid solely to save money in gas probably does n't  make sense , while swapping out a true gas guzzler does.I Want To Get Rid of My PaymentsCar payments most people will tell you are as inevitable as death and taxes .

And if you 're going to have a car , few can afford to buy one outright ergo , car payments are a way of life.It does n't  need to be that way , though . With some financial planning , you can pay cash for a car and get yourself out from under the inscrutable bootheel of the credit industry . One way to get out of a payment is to sell your current vehicle on which you owe money , and get into one that you can buy for cash.The Argument For Keeping ItTwo questions are going to make this decision easy : Do you have at least some equity in your current vehicle ? Do you have a bit of cash to buy a decent , well-used automobile ? If you 've answered " no " to one or both of these questions , you 're probably better off riding it out with your current vehicle , and putting aside some money when the value of your vehicle exceeds the amount you owe on it.The Argument For Cutting It LooseIf you 've answered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life without car payments . That does n't  mean you wont be spending money on your car : Maintenance costs money , and it costs more money the older a car gets . But you wont be writing a check to the bank for the privilege of having a car any longer . The Final AnswerIf you can find a way to get yourself out of debt for your car , do it . It frees up your liquid cash for other things like vacations , dining out and replacing your water heater when it let 's go all over your basement.My Transmission Went Belly UpTwo common misconceptions to clear up : One , transmissions rarely fail these days .

Replacement costs for a new transmission range from $2,500 to $4,500 , consisting of a remanufactured transmission and four to nine hours of replacement time , at a rate between $450 and $850 . Expensive ? Yes . But have you priced a new car lately ? What kind of a car can you buy for $4,500 ? What would it cost to replace the car you 're driving with a new model , especially if you 're trading a car with a junk transmission ? <p> The Argument for Cutting it LooseInvesting $4,500 in a car that 's only worth $3,000 on its best day seems like a waste of resources .

After canvassing the area , deputies determined Coleman was the shooter and that he had driven from the scene in a black Nissan . <p> Deputies drove to a house they suspected Coleman would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Coleman came out of the house and surrendered to deputies shortly after their arrival . Deputies found a handgun wrapped in a plastic bag in the garage of the home . <p> A witness identified Coleman from a photo line-up and said Coleman had fired at him after he shot and killed Carter . <p> Coleman was arrested and charged with two counts of first-degree murder , one count of attempted first-degree murder and possession of a firearm by a convicted felon . The firearm charge has since been dropped . <p> Since his arrest , there have been two mistrials in his case . The first occurred during the guilt phase in May 2016 when a witness mentioned , unprompted , that he had previously been incarcerated . <p> Coleman was adjudicated guilty for attempted first-degree murder in 1997 , for which he was sentenced to 10 years in prison and 10 years probation , and for domestic violence battery in 2010 , for which he was sentenced to four months in jail and one year probation , along with other charges , according to court records . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ penalty phase in October , when the Supreme Court 's decision was handed down . <p> Spivey said Coleman 's situation is rare . <p> " It 's rare in the sense that the Supreme Court , right when we were about to start the penalty phase , that the Supreme Court invalidated it , " he said . <p> Circuit Judge Robert Hodges decided to postpone the penalty phase after the Supreme Court 's ruling . The trial will tentatively start in the beginning of May , but no exact date has been set . <p> Spivey said he believes the trial will last about a week . Usually , witnesses called during the penalty phase lean more toward the expert category psychologists , psychiatrists , detectives , etc. and focus on aggravating factors , including whether the crime was especially heinous , atrocious or cruel , the defendant 's prior convictions and the circumstances of the crime among other things . But Coleman 's penalty phase trial will be a mixture of penalty and guilt phase witnesses . <p> " One of the biggest challenges is educating this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Assistant State Attorney Amy Berndt said . " It 's balancing what witnesses to call to prove the penalty portion and what witnesses to call to prove the facts . " <p> Some witnesses have already been called to testify twice , Berndt said , so they may be daunted by testifying a third time , especially those who live out-of-state . <p> The questions used during jury selection will be different as well . Both Spivey and Berndt said their questions will focus mainly on the potential jurors ' views of the death penalty . <p> In a way , the unanimous rule helps the defense , Spivey said . Defense attorneys just have to find one potential holdout to stop their client from being sentenced to death . But with that comes added peer pressure in the jury deliberation room . <p> " If you 're in an 11-1 situation , there 's going to be a lot of pressure for the holdouts potentially , " Spivey said . " ( Jurors ) might be more likely to be subject to persuasion " even if they morally are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jury deliberations will run longer now as well . <p> As for the prosecution , Berndt said she believes securing the death penalty will now be harder , not just in Coleman 's case , but in all cases . <p> For now , both sides are preparing their arguments for the penalty phase . Berndt said she is going through all the testimonies to figure out what witnesses to call back to the stand .

The commission will review the ordinance and listen to public comments during the meeting . <p> The proposed regulation would prohibit dispensaries , also known as Medical Marijuana Treatment Centers , from being within 1,000 feet from any church , school or child care facility . Dispensaries could only be built in areas zoned for businesses .

@@97886965 @2086965/ <h> 5 mistakes to avoid when buying your first home <p> Monday <p> Apr 3 , 2017 at 6:00 AM <p> ( BPT ) - Buying your first home is comparable to the first time you ride a bike . You can learn how it works from your parents and observe it from a distance , but you really wo n't know the ins and outs until you sit down on the bicycle and start riding . <p> Like most beginners , first-time homebuyers will likely make a few mistakes as they initially go through the home-buying process in the upcoming year . Here are five mistakes first-time homebuyers often make , and how to best avoid them . <p> 1 . Waiting too long to make an offer <p> One of the biggest mistakes first-time homebuyers will make in 2017 is waiting too long to get into the real estate market , according to Jay Carr , a senior loan advisor for RPM Mortgage in Newport Beach , California . Because the rates look like they 're going to continually increase over the year , buyers should get in as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> 2 . Trying too hard to get less than the asking price <p> Many first-time buyers are tech-savvy and comfortable researching homes on their own . Overall , these are positive traits in a buyer . However , because these buyers are typically self-sufficient when it comes to purchases , they often think they know best when it comes to what price they want to offer on a house . <p> " Buyers rely too much on what they see on the internet instead of the good advice of what they would hear from a real estate agent , " Carr says . <p> While sometimes it pays off to be bold in an offer , often the buyers negotiate themselves out of a deal . Pay attention to your real estate agent , who is a seasoned professional , when it comes to putting in an offer so you do n't  offend the seller and lose the house you want . <p> 3 . Not exploring all your financing options <p> Carr says many first-time buyers have grown up thinking they need to save up for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ market . While it is always great to have as much money to put down as possible , many new options are available . <p> One option is a home ownership investment such as the Unison HomeBuyer program , which typically provides up to half of the down payment you need . The money is an investment in the home , not a loan , so there are no interest charges or monthly payments . This new type of financing which works in combination with a traditional 30-year mortgage can offer greater flexibility and control to the home buyer . It allows you to cut the time needed to save for a down payment in half , lower your monthly payments and avoid mortgage insurance , or increase your purchasing power so you can buy the home you want . <p> 4 . Wanting the dream house right away <p> Everyone has a picture in their minds of what their first home will look like . Whether you envisioned a craftsman bungalow near all your favorite bars and restaurants or a classic ranch-style home with tons of land and no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to that dream home from your first starter home . <p> " If you really like the house , you probably cant afford it . If you think the house is just kind of below what you want its probably right in your price range . Get in the market rather than wait to get the dream house , " Carr says . <p> Carr advises those in the hunt for their dream home to focus on becoming homeowners now and to wait on their dream home until they have built up equity and have higher incomes in the future . <p> 5 . Not having your own representation <p> Another mistake a first-time homebuyer can make is not having their own representation ( meaning they use the sellers agent as their own buyers agent ) . While this is not always a bad situation , Carr urges buyers to select a trustworthy real estate agent who will look after their best interests .

But that proposed interchange was mothballed ; instead , the next I-75 interchange will be north of Ocala to allow for the citys emerging distribution hub to get high-volume truck traffic onto the interstate .

Much of the $68 million , 12.3-mile project is being funded by the 1 cent sales tax approved by voters . The four-lane highway will give residents in this area of the county , including many in Marion Oaks , a more direct , quicker and less congested route . <p> On Thursday , Marion County officials and representatives from the county-hired consulting firm will meet with Marion Oaks residents to share details of the proposed highway , including the southern phase of the project , which will connect the southern end of Southwest 49th Avenue , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Marion Oaks Manor , just south of CR 484 in the western portion of the sprawling community west of I-75 . <p> Though not officially funded within the next six years or so , the south phase will soon be a topic of conversation .

That will be when each stage of the highway construction will come more into focus . <p> One part of the long-range plan , likely to occur sometime after 2024 , is connecting County Road 42 , where it dead-ends into I-75 in Pedro , to Marion Oaks Manor . That will mean erecting an overpass at I-75 , giving Marion Oaks residents a more direct path to the southeast section of the county , where communities such as Summerfield and The Villages are located . <p> At Thursdays meeting , there will be an emphasis on what is called the Southwest 49th Avenue alignment , also referred to as the south phase .

In large swaths of the Okefenokee Swamp , people once outnumbered alligators . <p> No longer . <p> The Okefenokee , in southeastern Georgia , is a rare and hopeful place where nature has begun to heal some of the rough treatment it received at the hands of commerce a century ago . <p> That lesson became very real as I nosed my kayak into a small meadow of waterlilies , wondering if I 'd see alligators that day . <p> And then the still waters of the Okefenokee suddenly started roiling around me . <p> Yes , I would see gators . <p> A lot of gators . <p> Immediately . <p> I was paddling toward Billys Island , about 5 miles long and a mile wide , the second-largest island in the Okefenokee .

Instead of multiple choice , you are now going to have to check all that apply . If there are three correct answers and you only pick two of them , you 're entire answer is wrong . I 'm going to make you draw diagrams and pictures of how you got your answer instead of letting you show your work using the standard algorithm . And they better be done my way . I 'm going to make you answer questions that should only take one minute and make sure it takes you 10 minutes . You 'll never finish the test in the 80 minutes I 'm going to give you .

Her sentence will be subject to review after 25 years , <p> By Nicki GornyStaff writer <p> Amber Wright will serve life in prison for her role in the 2011 murder of her 15-year-old ex-boyfriend , a judge ruled on Tuesday . Her sentence will be subject to review after 25 years . <p> " I have not seen or heard anything more despicable than what lead to Seath Jackson 's death , " Circuit Judge Anthony Tatti told Wright before handing down her sentence . <p> " I can not imagine a circumstance any worse , and I pray to my God that the reason behind all this is some chemical imbalance or a brain that has n't matured . It 's really hard to deal with the notion that such an evil could exist without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words and the sentence he selected for the 19-year-old Wright echoed those of Circuit Judge David Eddy , who first sentenced Wright in 2012 after a joint trial with her teenage brother and co-defendant . Eddy , at the time , called the murder the most heinous he had seen in 15 years as a judge . <p> <p> Seath Jackson saga : A horrific murder and the winding road to justice <p> <p> The siblings were among five young people who in 2011 lured Seath to a Summerfield home , where they beat him , shot him and burned his body in a backyard fire pit . Law enforcement authorities recovered Seath 's remains days later in paint buckets dumped at a nearby quarry , where two of the five co-defendants had disposed of them the day after the murder . <p> Assistant State Attorneys Amy Berndt and Robin Arnold cast the murder as an escalation of animosity between Seath and Wright , who had broken up on poor terms , and between Seath and another co-defendant , Michael Bargo , whom Wright dated after the breakup . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a retrial in January , based on an issue with the timing of her Miranda rights . Although her jury in January again found her guilty of first-degree murder , a statute change between her 2012 sentencing and her sentencing Tuesday left open the possibility of a lighter sentence . <p> While Florida Statute in 2012 mandated life in prison as the minimum sentence for any first-degree murder conviction , even if the defendant was a juvenile at the time of the murder , it today allows for more discretion on the part of judges in cases with juvenile defendants . <p> Wright was 15 at the time of the murder , the same age as the victim and the youngest of the five co-defendants . <p> In a letter she read aloud at the hearing , Sonia Jackson , the victim 's mother , said she has thought about the argument that prompted the statute change : that children 's still-developing minds and consciences are fundamentally different than those of adults , suggesting that children should not be subject to the same penalties . <p> But in Wright 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ statement what she cast as Wright 's key role in a deliberately planned murder . Jackson asked Tatti to send her to prison with a life sentence . <p> " It does n't take a fully developed mind to understand right from wrong , " Jackson said . " A 2-year-old learns that hurting others is not acceptable in our society . " <p> Turning to face Wright , Jackson also echoed words she read at Wright 's original sentencing : " Amber , we hope that guilt eats you inside and out knowing that you caused all this , " she said . " You fed into Bargo 's deranged desires with your lies . All this happened because of you . " <p> Although Bargo is said to have been the gunman , and is currently serving the most severe sentence , on death row , prosecutors emphasized at trial that Wright 's text messages lured Seath to the home that night . In an interview recorded at the Marion County Sheriff 's Office before her arrest , which the jury heard at trial , Wright said Bargo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and prison ministers who spoke in Wright 's defense acknowledged the Jackson family 's pain , but emphasized that Wright had grown and matured in the five years since Seath 's murder . <p> " I just hope and pray that you can make the right decision and give her a chance to be the person she could be , " Wright 's mother told Tatti tearfully . <p> She and two prison ministers said they have already seen changes in Wright since her incarceration , noting that she has since earned her GED and built positive relationships with other inmates . <p> Wright , who had not spoken at her trial in January , asked Tatti to recognize that she is not the same person she was five years ago . She said she feels guilty and remorseful , and that she finds it difficult to forgive herself , but said she is trying to be a better person . <p> " I 'm not going to say a wonderful person , " she said . " I 'm not . I make mistakes . I still do . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have that chance to prove myself . <p> " Not just to you , " she added , " or to anybody else , but to myself as well . " <p> The current statute on sentencing for defendants who commit serious crimes as children came in response to a U.S. Supreme Court ruling , which came down in the weeks before Wright 's trial and sentencing in 2012 and found that mandatory life sentences for juvenile defendants are unconstitutional . <p> Because Wright and her brother , Kyle Hooper , who was 16-years-old at the time of the murder , were sentenced to life without parole as a mandatory sentence , Hooper has been granted a re-sentencing on appeal . Wright , too , would have received a new sentencing on the same basis had she not been granted a new trial altogether . <p> The current statute , though , leaves open the possibility of a life sentence for juveniles in cases where a judge finds an intent to kill and considers several additional factors laid out in the statute . Among those factors are the defendant 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of peer pressure on the defendants . <p> Prosecutors and Junior Barrett , Wright 's attorney , interpreted the factors differently in Wright 's case , with Barrett emphasizing Wright 's age and Berndt emphasizing the gruesome circumstances of the murder . <p> After hearing all the arguments , Tatti , who said he had never sentenced anyone to life in prison in five years as a judge and did not take the responsibility lightly , sentenced Wright to life in prison with a review after 25 years . <p> " I hope that what 's responsible for that is some lack of development in your brain , something that you can grow out of , " he told Wright .

We live on a graded road in a rural area , and I think it would look beautiful and attract pollinators . Where is a good place to get seeds ? A : October and November are the months to sow Florida wildflowers for a spring bloom . The best way to find seeds is through the Florida Wildflowers Growers Cooperative.This is a group of wildflower farmers who sell their seed from a centralized source . They have small seed packets and larger bulk amounts available . My favorite offering from the cooperative is the mixed blends of wildflowers , such as the " butterfly mix " or the " bee knees " blend . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but check the packet and make sure they are appropriate for Florida . Preparation of your site will probably be the most difficult part of getting the wildflowers going . You may need to kill off some of the existing plants to reduce competition for the sprouting wildflower seeds . Do this by covering the area with thick cardboard or black plastic for two weeks , then remove the dead plants.Rake the soil smooth , and then sow the seeds at the depth recommended on the packet . Planting too deeply can inhibit germination ; the seeds should only be 1/8- to +-inch deep . Water the seeds at planting , and then every day for the next two weeks to ensure germination . By the spring , the wildflowers will blooming and attracting pollinators and compliments .

Likewise , would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ safe " with the liquid mixed products for weed control and prevention ? A : When you are doing home weed control , I encourage you to read the fine print on the label of the product you are using . This goes for the combination products such as a fertilizer plus herbicide ( weed and feed ) as well as other formulas of herbicides.The most common herbicide in weed and feed combos is the chemical atrazine . It is a serious chemical and needs to be used with caution . Read the entire label before applying it to control weeds and to prevent weed seeds from germinating.Timing is especially important if you use atrazine . The label states " do not use atrazine when temperatures are above 85 degrees F. " This means that temperatures need to be below 85 degrees for at least three days . If it warms up too much , you can have a burn on your St. Augustine lawn . The label also says " do not use in the root zone of ornamental plants . " The root zone of your oak trees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the leaves . Try to avoid these areas if possible.It is best to follow the Florida-friendly landscaping recommendations and apply your fertilizer separately from your herbicide . September is the last time to fertilize lawns in North Central Florida for the year . Then , when temperatures have cooled , apply an herbicide , if needed . You can either use a hose-end sprayer or tank sprayer to perform this task . This way , you can spot treat the problem areas in the lawn . You will save chemicals and not apply it where it is not needed . Also , check the label to make sure the herbicide is safe to use on your turf grass species . Many herbicides can harm the " Floratam " variety St. Augustine grass , so read the label carefully .

During our conversation , which centered on battery life , he told me most AA and AAA batteries were discarded by their owners long before the useful life of the batteries ended . <p> He explained that a thin film of invisible corrosion builds up on the batterys contacts and its just enough to interrupt the current flow to whatever device the battery is powering .

For several years the state Department of Education has voiced concern . And now , under newly elected Superintendent of Schools Heidi Maier and her administrative team , Marion has asked state education experts to help . <p> Teaching mentally challenged students can be a challenging task . Some days , a child with such disabilities will try to bang his or her head against the floor or act out in way that threatens the safety of others . <p> There are two practices that educators use : restraint and/or seclusion . But those tactics are now being phased out in most school districts . More and more , experts say that these tactics traumatize the students . <p> On occasion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the policies , which are designed to protect students , to the letter . In one case early this year , a Forest High School teacher was suspended for two days after she failed to follow proper restraint policies . <p> A restraint is defined as a " personal restriction that immobilizes or reduces the ability of a student to move his or her torso , arms , legs , or head freely . " Such restraints include , for example , holding a childs wrists to keep him from hurting himself or others . A " seclusion " is when a child is placed in a " safe " room by themselves to protect them from harming themselves or others . <p> In 2012 , 1 in 91 students was restrained in Marion County . The state average was 1 in 314 . During that same year , Marion had a seclusion rate nearly 13 times higher than the state average . Marion secluded 1 of every 101 students , compared to the state average of 1 in 1,295 . <p> Despite a lengthy U.S. Department of Education report @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rates have continued to be higher than the state . <p> In 2013-14 Marion hit a five-year low : 395 restraints and 200 seclusions . That was still higher than the state average . Marion was back up to 498 restraints and 477 seclusions in 2014-15 and 467 restraints and 377 seclusions in 2015-16 . <p> After discussion with the state DOE , Maier says its time to better train teachers and administrators on how to address behavior before it leads to restraints and seclusions . The nations top education experts believe these tactics should only be used as a last resort . <p> " We have to provide more in-service training to our teachers , " said Maier , adding she is not laying the blame at the feet of her Exceptional Student Education teachers . " This is how they have been trained to handle these situations . I will fix this with more training . This is one of many problems this district is facing . " <p> Maier and her administrative team have been working hand-in-hand with the state . DOE has been in Marion this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is part of its routine visit to all statewide districts to observe turnaround schools , or schools with low test scores . <p> Maier said her new staffing plan will add more personnel at each school , including manpower to work with ESE children . The hope is that , with more hands on deck , behavioral issues can be addressed before staff feels compelled to use restraints and seclusions . <p> Grantham said his team has been fanning out across the state , reviewing practices in other districts . The goal is to find the best practices to handle behavior before it gets to a point where the child is out of control and needs these interventions . <p> The U.S. Department of Educations report from 2012 included a letter from Arne Duncan , who was the education secretary back then . It stated that " restraint or seclusion should never be used except in situations where a childs behavior poses an imminent danger of serious physical harm to self or others . " <p> " Schools must do everything possible to ensure all children can learn , develop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of academic achievement , " Duncan wrote . " To accomplish this , schools must make every effort to structure safe environments and provide a behavioral framework , such as the use of positive behavior interventions and supports . " <p> A recent case from Forest High School is a good example of how complex these situations can be . The case involved the son of Kerry Runnels , who happens to be a School District employee who works at Hillcrest School . <p> Runnels ' 14-year-old son is autistic . On Jan. 17 the boy was acting out in class , banging his head on the floor , poking a teachers aide and even , according to staff , attempting to spit on employees . When he would not go willingly to time out , the teenager was taken by the teacher and aide to the corner of the room by using what is called a " hook transport . " <p> One witness said the boy was dragged , though the teacher and aide said they used appropriate techniques . <p> While the boy was forced to stand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Joellie Gonseth , held the back of the boys head and kept it pushed against the wall . Gonseth admitted that she did hold the boys head , which is against district policy , but said she only did so to prevent him from further hurting himself as he kept banging his head . <p> Gonseth received a two-day suspension , a letter of reprimand , and will be required to undergo additional training . Gonseths actions " have been deemed inappropriate , unethical and in violation of School Board policy , " a district report states . <p> The teachers aide , Luther Evers , received a written reprimand . The report said the " hook transport " was not conducted exactly to policy . <p> Then-Superintendent George Tomyn recommended Evers be fired in 2013 after Evers grabbed a third-grader by the shirt collar and yelled at him in the lunch room an accusation he denied during a hearing . The School Board overruled Tomyn 's recommendation and instead suspended Evers for 20 days without pay . Evers was then placed back into the classroom . <p> Back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the district did not issue a timely report to the state that the actions , or restraints , had occurred . The incident , in itself , is not an approved restraint ; thus , it was not entered in the state database as a restraint , said Craig Ham , the districts deputy superintendent of operations . <p> After the elder Runnels complained numerous times to the district and even called the state Department of Education , the district officially filed a restraint report on Feb. 9 . <p> " It is our belief that even though it was not an approved restraint technique that it should be entered ( into the state database ) as a restraint , " Ham noted . <p> Runnels is trained at Hillcrest in the same restraint policies as the Forest High School employees . He said he is acting as a parent , not an employee . He said that the district failed his son in many ways , and especially these two : He was not told that his son banged his head repeatedly ; and officials failed to report @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " We should have been contacted about this , " Runnels said . " We probably would have taken him to the emergency room . " <p> Runnels said that , for now , he is keeping his son out of school . He is working with Forest officials to put his son back into the classroom . Forest Principal Brent Carson declined comment , referring the Star-Banner to the district office . <p> Runnels said he can not in good conscience put his son back into the classroom with Evers , considering the teachers aides track record . <p> " They say all of the ( ESE ) teachers at Forest High will be getting additional training , " Runnels said .

Because the area is a national historic site , the ground there can not be disturbed past 6 inches without an archeologist being present to sift through the dirt for possible artifacts .

The council unanimously approved the annexation request with little discussion . <p> The property is now zoned for agricultural use . <p> Haines previously told the Star-Banner that joining the city would mean requiring fewer steps in getting development approval from state authorities . Remaining in the county would mean future development would have to go through not only the county zoning and building departments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ process for approval . <p> Gray said that if a city or county has a population of 1,000 people or more per square mile , it is exempt from large-scale development review by the state . And while most areas of unincorporated Marion County do not fit the criteria , the city of Ocala does . <p> While the farm is for sale , Gray said only about 125 acres along State Road 200 are being actively advertised and marketed . The property along State Road 200 would be targeted for commercial sale . <p> Haines said that even though the state review process would not be as stringent within the city , developers would still need Florida Department of Transportation and water management district approvals . <p> Hitchcock told the Star-Banner that city staff is still determining the financial impact of such a development on the city in the way of additional fire , police and utility services that will be needed to accommodate the proposed development . As part of the study the city also will look at potential property tax revenues from its development . <p> Only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spoke on the issue . <p> Ray Montgomery , of Ocala , said annexing the property gives the developer " free reign to do whatever he wants with the land . " <p> Montgomery said that plenty of developments and commercial properties in Ocala sit empty and that the proposed development of Eugene Melnyks land will end up being a financial burden on other city taxpayers . <p> " You guys are basically building this on a dream , " he told the city council . <p> He also said the burden for additional water for the development will be excessive and put a burden on an already strained aquifer . <p> You say that this is Horse Capital of the World , " he said to the council . " Do n't  call Ocala Horse Capital of the World because that is an insult to people who are trying to make a living ( with horses. ) . "

The attorney for the teacher says it is was private and that the recording was illegal . The school district 's attorney says the classroom is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And prosecutors say it 's a gray area.The issue began unfolding in October when the mother of the 7-year-old girl began to suspect something was wrong with her child , who can not speak.The mother placed a digital recorder in her child 's backpack , then listened to it when the child returned home.The recording reportedly revealed the child was called " a hippo , " a " hippo in a ballerina suit " and " a beached whale sleeping , " a School District report states.The teacher and the aide also reportedly chastised the child for wetting herself and made her wear soiled clothes and clean her own urine , the report stated.The mother shared the recording with School District administrators , and the teacher and aide were placed on paid leave . It took seven weeks for the district to verify who was speaking on the tape , officials said.Last week , Maplewood Elementary School teacher 's aide Deborah J. Adams was fired by the School Board for her role in the recording incident . Adams did not challenge Superintendent of Schools Jim Yancey 's recommendation to terminate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leave . Richardson requested a hearing in hopes of convincing the School Board to change its decision . That hearing will be held sometime after the first of the year.At that hearing , the board can uphold its decision and fire Richardson or change its mind and reinstate the 20-year veteran educator.In the end , Assistant State Attorney Ric Ridgway said , there was just not enough evidence to prosecute anyone involved in the October incident , which has sparked much debate over the legality of the tape and an expectation of privacy.Florida 's wiretapping law requires that both parties in a conversation give consent before a recording can be made . Florida makes it a crime to intercept , or record , any " wire , oral , or electronic communication , " unless all parties to the communication give consent.However , the law allows recordings to be made in places where there is no reasonable expectation of privacy , such as a conversation in a public where they could be overheard . In such cases , consent is not needed for someone to make a recording.District 's positionShortly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believed the recording was probably illegally obtained by the mother . Still , he felt Adams and Richardson should be fired based on what they said and did to the child , which was based solely on that recording.But hours after Yancey 's statement appeared on Ocala.com , the superintendent received an e-mail from his attorney , William Haldin , which Yancey passed along to the Star-Banner . Haldin said the taping was legal . " While Florida has a wiretap ' statute , the Florida courts have construed it to not apply where a recording is made in a party 's place of business , " Haldin wrote.The courts have said , according to Haldin , that a party has no reasonable expectation of privacy " in a place of business and , therefore , recording without a party 's knowledge in a place of business is not prohibited by the statute . Here , the party 's place of business is the school classroom . " Haldin further stated that the classroom is not only private , it is filled with students and " is accessible throughout the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and students . " " It can not reasonably be considered a private place for a teacher . The courts have gone on to say that in addition to a party expecting privacy at a location , the expectation must include a societal recognition that the expectation is reasonable , ' " Haldin quoted from a court decision.Haldin said he believes that society recognizes the opposite : " That society needs to know how teachers are treating handicapped children in its classrooms . " Teacher 's positionRichardson , the teacher , is being represented by Ocala attorney Robert Bradshaw , who believes that the evidence against Richardson was obtained illegally . Bradshaw said Richardson " had a reasonable expectation of privacy . " Though the Maplewood classroom could be deemed public , Bradshaw said only a few select administrators can just walk inside . Almost everyone else must register at the front office . If allowed inside , the person must hand over a driver 's license at the front office to get a badge . The teacher is then notified of the visitor.Based on that information , Bradshaw said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Richardson should have a reasonable expectation of privacy when it comes to conversations among themselves.Bradshaw said the statements , which he called improper , could have been between two employees who were frustrated and were blowing off steam out of earshot of the children . Bradshaw also said his client should be presumed innocent and that he has the right to examine the tape to determine what statements his client may have made and whether the statements were even made in front of students.Bradshaw included 51 letters of support from fellow teachers and parents in Richardson 's request for a hearing.Bradshaw also asked the board to seek a ruling from the court as to the legality of the recording before holding the termination hearing.School District officials will not honor his request.School District spokesman Kevin Christian said even if the recording is deemed to be illegally obtained , the district " still has the right to fire them for any reason . " Christian said the legality of the recording will not change Yancey 's decision.State 's investigationRidgway , the chief assistant State Attorney , said the issue of whether the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Was there a reasonable expectation that the conversation was private ? " Ridgway asked . It is very much in a gray area , he said . " There 's not a lot of cases in that area . " Ridgway said there was no proof the child suffered any physical harm . The second part of the child abuse statute revolves around mental abuse . " We would have to prove that there was psychological damage done to the child , beyond just being mean , " Ridgway said . That would be further hard to prove , he added , because the child is non-verbal and can not communicate about what happened.When it comes to prosecuting the mother for illegally recording someone , he said that the gray area played a big role in that decision . And since the teachers were not prosecuted , he believes it would be unfair to prosecute the mother of the child.Contact Joe Callahan at **27;1057;TOOLONG

Developers could sue community members for attorney fees but community members could n't similarly recover attorney fees from the developer even if they win the underlying case . <p> This new way to sue is only available when the underlying dispute surrounds a permit " authorizing the development of land .

Hammond / Special to the Star-Banner <p> The crystal-clear waters and freshwater springs of the Rainbow River have captivated residents and visitors for decades . Teeming with fish and wildlife , the translucent waters of the river extend 5.7 miles from the headsprings south to the Withlacoochee River . The beauty of this system is celebrated as an Outstanding Florida Waterway , Aquatic Preserve and a Registered Natural Landmark . <p> The mission of the Southwest Florida Water Management District is to manage water and related natural resources to ensure their continued availability while maximizing the benefits to the public . Our district is required to protect the Rainbow River , along with other water bodies throughout our 16-county region in west central Florida . Setting Minimum Flows and Levels , or MFLs , to limit water withdrawal impacts to these water bodies and prevent significant harm to the system is an important tool . <p> In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Protection Act , which requires water management districts to set MFLs for all first-magnitude springs , like the Rainbow , by July 1 , 2017 . District scientists use numerous tools to collect , record and analyze data to establish MFLs based on sound scientific principles . This work is documented in technical reports made available to the public on our website . The final step in the MFL evaluation process is for the work to be reviewed by an independent panel of scientific experts . <p> The districts scientists are uniquely qualified to perform this analysis , since they have evaluated and set MFLs for 207 other water bodies such as lakes , springs , wetlands , aquifers and rivers throughout the district and have a broad , regional understanding of the state . During the evaluation process for the Rainbow River , district scientists evaluated what would happen to water quality , wetlands , and habitats for a large variety of aquatic life if river flow was reduced by groundwater withdrawals . The staff-recommended MFL will protect 95 percent of the natural flow . After the MFL is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conditions of the river and re-evaluate the minimum flow criteria in the future . <p> The districts focus on protecting our springs involves more than setting MFLs . Conservation , the development of alternative water supplies , and regional water supply planning have contributed to a 20 percent reduction in groundwater use throughout the district over the last 20 years , while population has increased by approximately 40 percent . Other protections include , district cooperative funding for water quality improvement projects with local governments , utilities and agriculture . In addition , the Florida Department of Environmental Protection also provides funding for projects that reduce nutrients that are entering our springs . <p> As part of our holistic approach to safeguard our springs , the district requires the measurement and reporting of water use . District scientists monitor more than 70 springs , 35 spring-fed rivers and bays , and 300 wells for nutrients , water level and geologic data in our springs region . All this information assists district scientists in understanding how springs respond to groundwater withdrawals and other factors ; and it allows staff to update @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with new information . <p> Our staff takes a comprehensive approach to water protection by including key stakeholders in the process . In addition to our seven-member springs team , who have more than 125 years of combined experience and expertise in this area , the district has also brought together local , regional and state agencies to create the Springs Coast Steering , Management and Technical committees to identify issues , specific projects to improve and restore springs , and costs associated with managing the first-magnitude springs within our region . This resource protection is part of a Surface Water Improvement and Management Plan designed specifically for Rainbow Springs . These efforts , combined with protection under the MFL program , will help to maintain or improve water quality and clarity in the future , ensuring the river can be enjoyed for generations to come . <p> To learn more about the districts efforts , visit our website at WaterMatters.org/Springs and find out how you can help us preserve our springs . <p> Mark A.

@@97887039 @2087039/ <h> Emory Schley : Golden ways to exercise those gray cells <p> here 's an idea : Why not learn a different aspect of the language you already know ? <p> I keep reading reports about how one can supposedly stave off Alzheimers Disease . Most emphasize three points : good nutrition , physical exercise and keeping your brain active . <p> The good nutrition is fairly easy . Cut back on red meat , quit eating junk food and add lots of vegetables and fruit to your diet . <p> Some will think physical exercise is the most difficult , and that may be true , especially for those of us who are getting up in years . <p> However , that last point about keeping the brain active could be the most difficult . But scientists have given us a clue to this one by telling us the brain creates new neural pathways and whatever else the brain does when we take on learning new subjects . <p> Language is an area that really grasps the brains attention and forces it into a good workout . Here in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , institutes and informal groups where learning various subjects takes place , but not everyone wants to learn a foreign language . <p> So , here 's an idea : Why not learn a different aspect of the language you already know , English ? <p> How do you do that ? One way is by learning Morse code . Before you start to chuckle over that one , consider for a moment what Morse code is : It is a strictly aural form of the language . Experts say the best way to learn Morse is to NEVER look at a chart depicting the various characters , ONLY listen to the sounds representing those characters . <p> Morse code actually is used by some people who have lost their ability to speak . It can even be used by the deaf , either through tactile sensation or flashing lights . Its not too difficult to learn and it keeps your brain busy . If you go to lcwo.net , you 'll find all the resources you need to learn Morse ( they call it " CW , " a radio term @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 30 languages . <p> Another site is k7qo.net . Scroll down to " The K7QO Code Course CD " under the map of the United States . Both resources are free . <p> Not interested in Morse code ? OK , then how about learning Braille ? <p> I mentioned Braille inscriptions on ATM machines here recently , and Pat Kingwell wrote to tell me about Hadley School for the Blind and Visually Impaired . It offers a completely free course in learning to read Braille . She added , " The school is tuition-free to people all over the world . They send you your lessons along with a recording , and the instructors are always available to help you via email or phone or computer . They are the very best and kindest and most patient souls God ever created , believe me ! <p> " You start out just learning to get the feel of the dots , and before you know it you are learning a letter , then groups of letters , then words and suddenly you find yourself beginning to read and write Braille @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ details . <p> Reading Braille can be a handy skill even for sighted individuals . For example , you can give a speech without ever looking down at your notes . I saw a blind woman do just that one time and I thought she was speaking extemporaneously until I spotted what she was doing with her hands . I was highly impressed . Those with macular degeneration or other eye diseases might find study of Braille useful , too , especially if they start before their vision deteriorates very far . <p> But whether you actually need Morse code or Braille is not really the point here . The point is that either can be an enjoyable way to exercise those old gray cells and keep them in pristine condition . It just may help to ensure your Golden Years are , indeed , Golden ! <p> FISH DINNER : Seafood lovers can rejoice !

Did she manage to escape ? <p> Um , duh . Thanks to some detective work from ... well , the whole team , basically , Kensi gets rescued just in the nick of time -- but not before getting into a brutal fight with Ferris , who 's eventually shot dead by Deeks ( Eric Christian Olsen ) during a final raid . ( Side note -- it 's kind of hilarious that Kensi never asks anyone about Hetty and Granger 's well-being , since she 's been shown images of their " dead bodies " moments prior . Is the implication that she obviously knew they were fakes ? Sure , let 's go with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only one who walks away from the mission wounded . When the team arrives at the first location where they believe Kensi is being held , Callen ( Chris O'Donnell ) is shocked to discover that there is , in fact , a woman tied to a chair there . But it 's not Kensi . It 's his ex-girlfriend , Joelle ( Elizabeth Bogush ) . Joelle spins an unlikely yarn about how she was randomly carjacked by someone earlier that day , and did n't see or hear Kensi ... even though they were supposedly brought to the same location by the same man . But though the pieces of her story are n't exactly fitting together , everyone accepts it at face value except for Hetty ( Linda Hunt ) , who confronts Joelle and gets her to admit that she 's actually a CIA officer , and was lying to Callen the whole time . <p> NCIS : LA to honor Miguel Ferrer in March episode <p> While the team is trying to track down Kensi and Hetty is dealing with Joelle , Granger ( Miguel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hospital .

( The show is planning to pay tribute to Ferrer , who died last month , in an upcoming episode . ) In the meantime , Hetty has enlisted the help of retired Admiral A.J. Chegwidden ( John M.

Deeks is obviously thrilled to get the love of his life back , but his desperate ( and violent ) behavior during the search for Kensi earned him some sideways glances from Callen , Sam ( LL Cool J ) and Hetty . Granger is not in good shape , and Hetty 's about to lose her right-hand man . Callen is left sawing away at his dining room table as he tries to process Joelle 's betrayal . And there 's a huge dangling loose end in the form of Sabatino ( Erik Palladino ) , who somehow manages to escape being handcuffed to a car while Deeks , Callen and Sam are rescuing Kensi . Though he spends the bulk of the episode trying to convince Hetty &amp; Co. that he 's actually on their side , he 's already proven that he ca n't be trusted .

Democrats said erasing the requirement means big companies will be able to hide questionable dealings with foreign governments like Russia . <p> Trump pledged during his campaign to repeal and replace the Dodd-Frank law , which also created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau . A senior White House official outlined his executive order in a background briefing with reporters Thursday . <p> " Dodd-Frank is a disaster , " Trump said earlier this week during a meeting with small business owners .

They just ca n't get any money because the banks just wo n't let ' em borrow because of the rules and regulations of Dodd-Frank . " <p> Trump 's order wo n't have any immediate impact . But it directs the Treasury secretary to consult with members of different regulatory agencies and the Financial Stability Oversight Council and report back on potential changes . <p> That likely includes a review of the CFPB , which vastly expanded regulators ' ability to police consumer products from mortgages to credit cards to student loans . <p> Trump administration officials , like other critics , argue Dodd-Frank did not achieve what it set out to do and portray it as an example of massive government overreach . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forced to hoard capital and they ca n't take any risk .

The original story referred to a different neighborhood . <p> Ocala Fire Station One is the citys oldest operating emergency response facility and while sentiment might favor keeping it open , logistics is not on the side of the venue . <p> Station One is showing its age . Expensive repairs are needed . But the greatest challenge is related to response times for Ocala Fire Rescue personnel . <p> The City Council voted this week to allow its fire department to spend $145,000 as part of a plan that will close down the fire station , built in 1963 next to Tuscawilla Park . The money is for 0.40 acres at 340 NE Eighth Ave. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The other site , which is already owned by the city , is a former recycling collection location at 885 SE 31st St. , between South Pine Avenue and Southeast Lake Weir Avenue . <p> The two new stations combined will cost an estimated $4.2 million . <p> In the case of Station One , the tan brickwork reflects the architecture of the period and the building has been added to numerous times . But repairs to the building are looming , including $350,000 for a new roof , said Ocala Fire Rescue Chief Bradd Clark . <p> But the main problem that money can not fix has to do with its location . <p> More than half the calls for help that go to Station One mean that emergency vehicles have to cross Silver Springs Boulevard to get to their destinations . And coming from the stations current 410 NE Third St. location forces emergency responders to maneuver side roads before getting to that main thoroughfare . <p> " I do n't  think its in a good location , " Clark said . <p> While the goal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within four minutes , they often were not making that time when headed toward the Pine Avenue and Southeast 31st Street areas , Clark said . <p> The plan is to build two smaller stations on major thoroughfares for easy road access and in areas where there is a need for service . The city needs more than the six fire stations it now operates , he added . <p> Clark said the city does not have sufficient fire coverage in the south central area of town , which is often having to be served by Station One , Station Four at 3300 SW 20th St. and Station Two at 2701 SE 36th Ave . <p> " This is the best spot for the money , " Clark said of the Eighth Avenue site . <p> Station One replaced Ocalas first fire station , which was build in 1893 where the downtown parking garage is now located . Clark said once his department leaves the Tuscawilla building , the venue will revert back to the city . <p> Clark said that in going forward , his department will use money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year . The plan includes building an Ocala Police Department substation at the future 885 SE 31st St. fire station . <p> Bids for the two stations will go out in about a month and work should start around October , Clark said . <p> Ocala Mayor Kent Guinn said the fire station on Eighth Avenue is just what that area needs . <p> " It will mean the world " to that area and " really transform " the neighborhood , Guinn said . <p> Councilman Jim Hilty agreed , saying , " Thats really going to be advantageous to people in Ocala . " <p> " I think it 's a great idea , especially because of the logistics , " Hilty said of the two fire stations and citing a growing need for ambulance care in southeast Ocala . <p> Brent Malever , city council president , said that a fire station and police presence in the southeast area will aid business and help to address any crime . <p> " The benefit of that ( fire station ) is we do n't  right now have anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said . " And I think its important to have some kind of police out there too . Its not bad to have a substation , have two or three ( officers ) there . Its important to have a police presence .

The misstep knocked her tire out of alignment and eventually caused a tire to wear unevenly . <p> " That cost me $279 , " Andreoli said .

Other residents have twisted ankles while walking . <p> For 123 of the property owners in Sun Country Estates Phase II , the nightmare should be over by the end of this year . They reached out to Marion County government to create a special taxing unit that allows residents to pay for road repairs . Each parcel owner will pay about $5,000 , or about $500 in assessments each year for 10 years beginning in 2018 . <p> For many residents , it is a bitter pill to swallow . " I never dreamed when I moved here I would have to pay to rebuild my own roads , " Andreoli said . " I want it done to help with our property values . I just know it will be hard for some of the ( elderly ) residents on fixed incomes to afford it . " <p> Their experience is yet another reminder of what some Marion County residents might not realize : Property taxes do not pay for roads . <p> The county gas tax is the primary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Marion roads . The county only fills potholes and makes minor repairs in public subdivisions . Money generated by the gas tax does n't  even cover the needs for the more heavily traveled roads throughout the sprawling county , which is larger in size than Rhode Island . <p> The one-cent sales tax approved by voters last year is expected to generate about $166.2 million for capital expenditures between Jan. 1 of this year and Dec. 31 , 2020 . That money , which will be divided among the county and city municipalities , will be used to improve roads and purchase needed equipment . Some of the money will be used for road projects that are not on the Florida Department of Transportation priority list . <p> Some residents might have mistakenly thought that the new tax revenue also would pay for neighborhood roads . But it wo n't . Officials say the money is needed for major roads to keep traffic flowing across the county . <p> If a county subdivision street needs resurfacing or must be replaced , that cost must be borne by the residents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Unit ( MSTU . ) The taxing unit program , as well as variations of it , have been the only way communities have been able to fund major road maintenance projects . <p> There are two types : MSTUs and Municipal Services Benefit Units ( MSBUs . ) Currently , there are 50-plus taxing units in Marion . The biggest are in Marion Oaks and Silver Springs Shores . Revenue derived from these units help resurface existing blacktop roads , replace existing blacktop roads , or pave dirt roads . <p> The road to victory <p> Unless you are a resident of Sun Country Estates , you may have never heard of the development of about 250 parcels , located south of SR 200 . It sits across the six-lane highway from Joy Evangelical Lutheran Church and just west of the Marion Landing retirement community . <p> Along SR 200 there are no signs for Sun Country Estates , just curved blocked walls at the entrance with nothing written on them . As soon as drivers enter the first part of the community , known as Sun Country Estates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Sun Country Estates , made up mostly of mobile and modular homes , was launched in 1982 just after On Top of the World opened . At the time , long before dozen of other communities and neighborhoods would pop up , SR 200 was a two-lane highway mostly lined with farms . <p> In 1983 , about three blocks farther south off SR 200 , developers built Phase II of Sun Country Estates . Phase II is south of Southwest 85th Street and west of Marion Landing . It is that area that will soon get new roads . <p> The average blacktop roads life expectancy is about 25 years , and longer if the road is resurfaced after 15 years . The roads in Sun Country Estates are at least 34 years old , a year younger inside Phase II , and have never been resurfaced . The development is now home to more renters than resident owners , thus making it that much harder to get the majority to agree to pay $500 or so each year for a decade to repair the roads . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not vote to pay for new roads . For those residents , road plight will continue . <p> The quest for Sun Country Estates Phase II residents to pave their roads began about a year ago . Residents petitioned the county to start the MSTU process . The community had to have 10 percent of its parcel owners sign the MSTU petition . Jerry Wolfe , 73 , and his wife , Shirley , 79 , put up about half of the $500 application fee . <p> The Wolfes lives in a beautiful modular home , with a perfectly groomed yard , on Southwest 88th Place . Jerry Wolfe said that the county has come sporadically to fill potholes , but the roads in general remain in disrepair . Wolfe was one of many residents who routinely called Marion County government officials seeking pothole relief . He was surprised to learn that pothole repair is all that the county would do . <p> The roads are in such bad shape they will have to be replaced , not resurfaced . After the group submitted its petition with more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engineers to design the project and get cost estimates . <p> " We have had people get seriously hurt riding bicycles out here , " Wolfe said . Some residents brought photographs of damaged cars and injured people to meetings with county officials . <p> In its letter asking Phase II property owners to vote on the issue , the county noted : " No property taxes are currently used for road improvements within any public or private subdivision in Marion County , and the use of impact fees is very limited and can not be used to improve local subdivision roads in developed areas . <p> " The road assessment process is currently the only method available to provide improvements and it is direct benefit to property owners within your subdivision , " according to the May 5 from by Shawn Hubbuck , director of the Marion County MSTU/Assessment Department . <p> The county calculated that minimal cost to each parcel owner would be about $4,900 . The letter states that could reach $6,000 , depending on the cost of all the pieces needed to pave the roads . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Sun Country Estates Phase II property owners . Many residents who supported the project were shocked to win , considering at least half of the property owners rent out their homes . <p> Hubbuck said work can begin after an official public hearing can be held and the County Commission can approve the project . That vote should come in about two months . <p> Wolfe said the project may take a little more time than expected because he was told that Marion County Utilities will install fire hydrants before the new roads are put in . ( The hydrants are funded by the county , not the residents . ) <p> Wolfe pointed outside his window at the street in front of his home . The road has many , many repaired potholes . He said there is one reason the county has been out to fill the potholes so many times : " I have the biggest mouth . " <p> Down the street from Wolfe , Onil Goyette , 65 , and his adult daughter , Lisa , were zig-zagging around potholes during an afternoon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago and was pleased that there are plans to replace the roads . Both he and his daughter wish the county would also install street lights . <p> Issues everywhere <p> Marion County has 2,534 county-maintained roads , half of which are subdivision roadways . There are about 400 miles of dirt roads in unincorporated Marion , according to the latest statistics . <p> Of the 1,215 miles of non-subdivision roads , 56 miles are graded as " failure " and 288 miles as " poor . " The county does not routinely evaluate the 1,319 miles of subdivision roads . At $50 per foot to pave a neighborhood road , it would cost $343.5 million to resurface all 1,301 miles . That 's why the county adopted measures requiring neighborhoods to fund their own road projects . <p> Marion County communities started adopting these taxing districts in the mid-1980s . The requests have produced about 650 miles of new road . <p> MSTUs are not just created for roads --- or for small areas . For instance , all property owners in unincorporated Marion County pay a property tax @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and detectives . There also are MSBUs , funded by assessments , formed to address road repaving , street lights and mowing . <p> Tracy Straub , Marion County government 's traffic engineer , said major construction projects take precedent over neighborhood roads . In some cases the county will resurface a road in a neighborhood if it is a heavily traveled cut-through used by drivers from outside the development . But in most cases , the county will only do patch work --- when crews are available . <p> " We do not pave in neighborhoods , " Straub said . " There is just not enough money for us to do that . " <p> Andreoli will be relieved when the new roads are built . But she still will need to be creative when traversing Sun Country Estates Phase II . That 's because Sun Country Estates Phase I , which also has deplorable roads , will not be upgraded , and those roads must be crossed to get to SR 200 . <p> Joe Callahan can be reached at 867-4113 or at **27;1273;TOOLONG .

Donald Trump will take Washington by storm , no matter what the weather . ( Which , by the way , looks like rain . ) <p> Some things to watch for on Inauguration Day : <p> <p> 35 or 39 ? <p> Trump 's oath of office is the only essential on Friday ; all the rest is window dressing . The Constitution sets out a 35-word oath for the new president . Some presidents make it 39 by tacking on " so help me God . " There are conflicting stories about when the ad lib started . The National Archives says George Washington added the words when he took the oath at his 1789 inaugural . Some say the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chester Arthur 's inauguration in 1881 . Historian Jim Bendat says Washington 's use of the phrase is a myth , but every president since 1933 has done it . <p> <p> THE SPEECH <p> Trump 's inaugural address will set the tone for the launch of his presidency . Will he go the traditional route and offer a message of unity to a divided nation , play the role of disrupter of the established order , or blend a little of both ? This wo n't be his usual off-the-cuff address . Aides say Trump has taken a big role in writing the speech and has been practicing at Trump Tower . Expect him to keep it short , around 20 minutes or so . <p> <p> AWKWARD <p> When Trump is sworn in , Hillary Clinton will be sitting on the inaugural platform alongside husband Bill Clinton . She 'll be intent on keeping a poker face , but that 's got to be tough . All eyes will be watching to see whether Trump has any interaction with his vanquished rival , or mentions her in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LUNCH <p> Washington ate alone after his 1789 inauguration . Trump will go straight from his swearing-in to a lavish luncheon of Maine lobster and Angus beef for 200 in the Capitol 's Statuary Hall . It 's not just about lunch , though . Good relations between the new president and the Republican-led Congress will be key to the success of the Trump presidency . Early maneuvering has shown Trump and GOP legislators to be on different pages at times about important issues such as taxes and health care . So amid the toast-making and the gift-giving of the day , the legislators and new president will be feeling one another out . <p> <p> POWER MARCH <p> Start your stopwatch . More than 8,000 people will march in the 1.5-mile inaugural parade down Pennsylvania Avenue , from the Capitol to the White House . That 's actually a relatively restrained dose of inaugural pomp . Trump 's team wants to keep the parade to 90 minutes so the new president has time to do some work . The longest parade , with 73 bands and 59 floats , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's first inauguration in 1953 . <p> <p> FIRST STEPS <p> Trump aims to squeeze in a little work on his first day in office , perhaps in between the parade and the evening balls . What to watch for : His aides mention possible executive actions and perhaps the swearing-in of some members of his Cabinet . <p> <p> BIG LEAGUE ? <p> Trump has tweeted that " record numbers " of people are pouring into Washington for his inauguration . That 's doubtful . There are still hotel rooms for rent . And , contrary to Trump 's claims , stores still have plenty of ball gowns to sell . No one believes this inaugural will come close to the estimated 1.8 million people who attended Barack Obama 's first inaugural . But with no official arbiter of crowd counts , expect a post-inaugural tussle over how many people really showed up . <p> <p> DISSENTERS AND BIKERS <p> Protesters turn out for any inauguration . This year , one of the biggest pushbacks against Trump will be the Saturday women 's march , which could draw 200,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Friday , though , with some demonstrators aiming to shut down or cause delays at security checkpoints going in to the swearing-in ceremony . And then there are the Bikers for Trump , promising to come in throngs and serve as " a wall of meat " if needed to protect Trump 's supporters . <p> <p> CELEB WATCH <p> Trump says he 's got the " biggest celebrities in the world " coming to town for his inauguration . Yes , there are A-list celebrities in town but you may need to check out non-inaugural venues to find them . <p> Trump will have singer Jackie Evancho singing the national anthem at his swearing-in . Performers at his inaugural balls include the Radio City Rockettes , The Piano Guys , 72-year-old Tony Orlando and 81-year-old Sam Moore , from the soul duo Sam and Dave . Over at the nonpartisan Creative Coalition bash , the headliner is Grammy-winning Blues Traveler , and hosts will include Tim Allen and John Leguizamo . <p> There 's always intense interest in what the new first lady will wear , both for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it 's not simply a matter of fashion . It 's political . A number of designers have said they do n't want to dress Melania Trump because they disagree with her husbands ' policies .

Musicians who have agreed to play the inaugural have faced a backlash from Trump critics . Watch to see if the first lady 's designer does , too .

But what school district officials found after analyzing attendance figures in 2015 was that nearly 1 in 5 Marion County students were missing 10 or more days of school a year . Nearly 7 percent were missing more than 18 days a year , or 10 percent of the whole school year . <p> The school system implemented a program called Attendance Counts last year , and the first-year results were that on average 268 more children attended school each day in 2016 than in 2015 . <p> The most important factor in achieving those results , of course , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ administrators and School Board members bemoan the difficulty in getting parents involved in their childrens education . And that does not mean just attending PTO meetings or school events , but making education a priority in the household . <p> New Superintendent of Schools Heidi Maier listened and has responded . On Tuesday , the School Board voted 3-2 to approve a new position called director of family , school and community engagement to go out into the community and actively develop programs and events that will encourage parents who are currently not engaged to become so . <p> The $86,000-a-year job will not be an easy one . In a community where 20 percent of the adult population is considered illiterate , too many parents simply do not know how to navigate our large school system its one of the nations 120 largest , by the way or are not aware of programs and people in the system who can help their children with everything from academic issues to health needs to family problems . <p> Whoever Maier names to this new director-level job will be challenged by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between too many parents and the importance of a good education . On the other hand , when the Engage in Education initiative of the Marion County Public Education Foundation conducted a series of focus groups two years ago to determine the communitys public education priorities , the one item that brought unanimous agreement was the need for more information about our schools . The focus groups covered everyone from students and seniors to business people and civic leaders to educators and politicians . It was the one area upon which all the groups agreed people simply do not understand the workings of the school system . <p> Maier was right to push for this position , now it will be up to her to make it effective , indeed successful . Parents often simply are intimidated and understandably so by the system and , unfortunately , by some of the school officials and teachers they encounter . They need an advocate , a guide to help them find the resources that will help their child succeed .

This means , among other things , meeting the requirements of any adopted Minimum Flows and Levels ( MFLs ) , which are formally approved plans for restoring water bodies suffering from a lack of water . The Santa Fe and Ichetucknee Rivers have an MFL because their flows have dropped precipitously in recent years .

" <p> The journalist has an additional warning from the late , great Peter Jennings : " I do n't think a reporter should give advice or make predictions . " <p> But what would the end of one year be without a bit of forecasting about what will happen in the next ? And while the Florida political world can always be counted on to produce an offbeat story or two , we can expect a few things to dominate the conversation in 2017 . The unexpected will truly have to wait for another day . <p> THE ELECTION IS OVER . LONG LIVE THE ELECTION : Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only one thing for politicians to do : gear up for the 2018 midterm elections . And the best way to do that might be to pack away a few accomplishments and talking points in 2017 . <p> Republican Gov . Rick Scott is angling for the U.S. Senate seat held by Democrat Bill Nelson , potentially setting up a battle between two of the state 's perennially underestimated politicians . Meanwhile , there 's no shortage of would-be candidates possibly lining up to fight for Scott 's current job : Agriculture Commissioner Adam Putnam , House Speaker Richard Corcoran , outgoing Democratic Congresswoman Gwen Graham and Democratic trial lawyer and mega-donor John Morgan are just some of the marquee names who could jump into the contest . <p> For those not interested in the governor 's mansion or the Senate , three Cabinet posts will be up for grabs in 2018 : Putnam , Chief Financial Officer Jeff Atwater and Attorney General Pam Bondi are barred by term limits from running for re-election , and Bondi might be headed to Washington , D.C. early in 2017 . A few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year , but signs of who is serious about taking the plunge will be clear long before then . <p> PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP : Trying to predict anything that the nation 's mercurial new chief executive will do is dangerous . But the part-time Floridian Donald Trump and his fellow Republicans have already floated some ideas that could affect the Sunshine State . <p> Bondi is seen as a likely candidate for a position in the Trump administration , given her outspoken support for Trump during the campaign and her apparent interest in a Beltway job . On the policy front , some in the GOP hope Trump seizes the opportunity to reshape the relationship between Washington and the states . <p> Turning the joint state-federal Medicaid program into a block grant , for example , would allow Florida lawmakers a much freer hand in deciding how the program works . Changes in trade policy could have repercussions for the state 's ports . Stronger enforcement of immigration laws could also have unpredictable effects in a state where even the Republican Party is sometimes divided on how to treat undocumented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already shaping up for the 2017 legislative session focuses on whether the state should continue to spend tens of millions of dollars to attract tourism and business investment to Florida . Corcoran is an outspoken opponent of the spending .

And Senate Appropriations Chairman Jack Latvala , R-Clearwater , also supports some level of spending .

A recent blow-up over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helped matters . <p> CORCORAN AND NEGRON TAKE COMMAND : Every other year , when a new House speaker and a new Senate president take office , Capitol denizens debate whether and how the leaders will get along . The attention is particularly keen after Corcoran and Senate President Joe Negron , R-Stuart , formally moved into their new roles following the November elections . <p> Corcoran is almost universally viewed as a smart , hard-driving conservative who is willing to grind things to a halt if necessary to avoid compromising on certain issues . At least in public , Negron is more laid back and tends to the wonkish side on policy fights . <p> They also have different priorities . The Senate president has floated an additional $1 billion in higher education spending and new investment in the Everglades . Corcoran appears to be more interested in changing how Tallahassee works , implementing new lobbyist disclosure and budgeting rules . How those goals might come together --- or collide --- will determine how smoothly the 2017 session will go . <p> PINCHING PENNIES , A BILLION AT A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' projections of how much money the state will bring in next year .

That will be particularly true if lawmakers want to once again hold local education property taxes steady regardless of rising home values , something that could consume $400 million in state money . <p> Negron has acknowledged that some of his spending priorities will have to come from cutting other areas of the budget , but that could cause its own headaches in the form of advocates who support the programs on the chopping block . <p> ANOTHER SPIN : The annual food fight that is a gambling bill is likely to return to the Legislature , this time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a revised gaming agreement with the Seminole Tribe . A federal judge 's ruling last month that the state had violated the tribe 's exclusive rights to offer some games added impetus to the negotiations . But any package of gambling bills is likely to attract issues that make it incredibly difficult to get a deal done . <p> YOU FIX IT : In addition to whatever they might want to do , lawmakers will also have to deal with a to-do list from the state Supreme Court and voters . The court , for example , struck down a new death penalty law because it did not require unanimous jury recommendations to impose death sentences . The court also found unconstitutional parts of the workers ' compensation insurance system . <p> Meanwhile , voters approved allowing full-strength medical marijuana to be used in the treatment of numerous conditions .

Rick Scott called and told him to head to Marion County .

He relied on experience gained during his years working at the Alachua County Sheriffs Office . With all the information , one of his first actions was to suspend two of Blairs trusted confidants Majs . Don Maines and Tommy Bibb with pay .

" But this purchase was also strategic in that we have over 90,000 square feet of facilities on 22 acres fronting I-75 and right across the street from the new FedEx Distribution Center .

Grantham was hired by Superintendent of Schools Heidi Maier , who was elected a month ago . Maier has been assessing all the schools and departments to determine what is needed to improve student test scores . <p> After weeks of visiting every school in the district , Maiers academic team has become more and more concerned about the number of schools that are on a federal No Child Left Behind watch list , as well as the eight schools in the Bottom 300 based on poor reading proficiency scores . <p> Marion County has four schools in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under the No Child Left Behind requirements .

If student scores do n't  improve , the schools could be forced to implement a new academic plan . <p> Based on scores from last spring , the new academic team is concerned that six more schools could struggle again this spring and could be placed on the No Child Left Behinds " planning " list if scores do not improve . Those schools are Anthony , East Marion , Marion Oaks , South Ocala and Wyomina Park elementary schools , as well as Fort King Middle School . <p> If all those schools do not fare well on next springs Florida Standards Assessments , that would mean 15 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) would be on some kind of No Child Left Behind status .

Her academic team has visited all district schools in just a few weeks . And they have held many conference calls and meetings with the Florida Department of Education . Officials said work has begun to align instructional material with state standards . <p> Officials said they are concerned about the next testing season because of the short time period until the testing season .

During his visits at schools , Grantham noticed that most every school had a substitute working . He said there are 57 teacher openings , and many educators are teaching without proper certification . <p> Grantham told the School Board that getting the district moving in the right direction will require a lot of work . Grantham , who has been on the job for only 13 school days , told the board to " hold me accountable " and hold all the administrators accountable to improve education . <p> For the changes to be made , Grantham said that it will take everyone to rebuild a viable education plan .

In Marion , 18.74 percent of ESOL students remain in the programs for more than five years , while the state average is 14 percent . <p> The district also wants to improve its ESE program and the state is assisting . While the state wants 100 percent of all ESE children to be evaluated within 60 days of being identified in need of services , Marions percentage was 94.8 percent so far this school year , up from 91 percent in 2014-15 school year . <p> The concerns about the state of schools comes after Marion students in nearly all tested grade levels and subjects lost ground on the state average in 2016 , according to data released by the state .

Using Twitter and fewer than 140 characters , Trump parroted a line just about every Republican president and a few Democrats ( most recently , Nancy Pelosi ) have used to describe Washingtons hopelessly fetid politics : " Drain the swamp . " <p> The only difference is that Trumps promise became a slogan used to raise the rafters at every campaign rally and event along with " Lock her up " and " Build that wall . " A few weeks before the general election , he backed his promise with a six-point plan : <p> 1 . Propose term limits on Congress . <p> 2 . Reduce the federal workforce . <p> 3 . Sunset two federal regulations for every new federal regulation . <p> 4 . Impose a five-year ban on White House and congressional officials becoming lobbyists after leaving service . <p> 5 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from lobbying foreign governments after leaving service . <p> 6 . Impose a complete ban on foreign lobbyists raising money for American elections . <p> Washington , while not built exactly on a swamp , was built on mostly low land prone to flooding . However , one area in particular , within the original District of Columbia , was indeed a swamp : Foggy Bottom , the nickname of the area on Connecticut Avenue where you can find the U.S. Department of State . <p> If any executive department needs draining , it is the State Department . After eight years of President Barack Obamas feckless foreign policy of crossed red lines , unfettered nuclear weapons proliferation , muddled NATO policies , slights and insults to our erstwhile allies , resets , pivots , a stunningly inept reading of the Arab Spring , the subsequent mishandling of the entire Middle East , and unanswered belligerence from China and Russia , the real problems with the State Department were really the four years Hillary Clinton served as secretary of state . <p> Obamas foreign policy was a spectacular , epic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a plan , perhaps even a vision , and he was nothing if not consistent and steady in his near-flawless execution of whatever it was he was hoping to achieve . <p> Hillary Clinton , on the other hand , was the swamp personified and therein lies the problem with Trumps six-point plan to drain the swamp . Some of the reforms might have mitigated some of the more egregious infraction of ethics , common sense and law , but nothing in the plan would have been more than a speed bump to the truly ambitious , power hungry or greedy . <p> You have to look at someone like Clinton as the problem to solve and deconstruct their behavior to understand what would have stopped them from selling access , wantonly and flagrantly flaunting laws , rules and regulations . What impediments would have to be in the way of such behavior and what tools would be necessary to extract the truth from them and bar their way against further aberrant behavior ? What can be done about someone like Clinton and others who have lied during congressional hearings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and yet hold onto their jobs and pensions and continue without shame or embarrassment to enjoy prestige and power ? <p> The answer lies in part in the proposed congressional term limits and bans on lobbying . Term limits will create a surplus of former congressmen , depressing the value of the contacts they sell . Likewise , a congressman who knows he will serve only a few terms will be a bit more courageous in ferreting out corruption and graft . <p> But the one thing , above all , not mentioned in any reforms , are " term-limits " for and the de-politicization of the bureaucracy . I propose two extra points to Trumps reforms : 1 . No government employee of an executive department above GS-10 may remain in his/her bureau for more than six years ( they may obtain a job elsewhere in the department , outside of their former bureau ) , and 2 .

They tend to like cold water , so you need to go deeper as you get into the warmer seasons . After the ice-out you want to be between the surface and 10 ' . In mid-spring you should be about 20 ' to 30 ' feet deep , while in late spring about 30 ' to 45 ' deep . The summer is difficult to determine because they like to stay in the thermal layers that are at around 53 degrees F or in shallow holes where cold water is pumped into the lake by a natural spring . <p> 1 . Yankeetown/Waccasassa : Jim Zaloga at **26;1434;TOOLONG said that with all of this cooler weather redfish have been biting in the creeks in the deeper holes . Trout are in the front of creeks , mouth of rivers and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trout are biting on live shrimp . <p> 2 . Crystal River/Homosassa : Capt . William Toney ( **31;1462;TOOLONG ) said with foggy conditions on a recent morning he moved my trip to midday to be on the safe side . Winter time is when fog can come in at any time of day . He said he has witnessed it roll in with the sea breeze in the middle of the afternoon . A good GPS can make or break a safe ride back to the river but can not tell you about unseen rocks , markers or fellow boaters so be safe and travel at a slow speed until good visibility prevails . The trout fishing is scattered over the near shore flats , creek mouths , backcountry bays and spoil islands . Rock grass is a plus when looking for good trout water . Moving water is best , but incoming tide is his favorite . Some of the best baits have been MirrOlure LIL Johns , D.O.A. 5.5 jerk baits , popping cork rigs and suspending plugs . The best colors are new penny , glow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ casting for redfish is very good right now because the water is a clear as it can be . The water temperature has dropped to the point that the nutrients that can cloud it have moved on . Flats edges with deep water near by are good places to pole your boat to find redfish . Look for pushes and wakes on a calm day to indicate that you are in a productive area . Redfish will move the shallow water as they feed . Do n't  be fooled by mullet that will move the water but in a small wake and meandering pattern . Flies with a crab pattern in white during the morning are easy to track with your eye but as the midday sun reaches overhead , I will tie on a darker crab/shrimp pattern . A tail hooked live shrimp is also very good but mind the splash it makes when casting to the redfish . Lead the fish further on the cast with live shrimp . The rivers are holding a few keeper mangrove snapper , small reds and small snook . Fun to catch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high tide will be late evening this weekend . <p> 3 . Withlacoochee : Capt .

Some are even speculating that her dedication to the Trump campaign might earn her an administrative position once the team transitions to Washington . <p> Here are five things to know about the 49-year-old Kellyanne Conway : <p> Her expertise is in public polling <p> Conway graduated with a law degree from George Washington University , and founded her own polling company in 1995 after time spent with Luntz Research Companies . According to a profile by People @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conservatives such as Newt Gingrich , former Vice President Dan Quayle and Sen.

And right now , Bill Clinton does n't score as high as Bob Dole on those issues with women . " <p> She might have been Trump 's most important hire in the campaign <p> As many think pieces have noted , Conway 's made frequent appearances on television down the stretch , in which she fended off journalists ' questions over Trump 's veracity and complicated relations with women .

" <p> The opening scene , featuring some very overweight naked women dancing on a stage , letting it all hang loose , is both grotesque and mesmerizing . Its happening at a reception put on by art gallery owner Susan ( Amy Adams ) , who 's got it all : Handsome husband , gorgeous home , successful career , and an accompanying emptiness that just keeps gnawing at her . <p> So is everything as it seems , asks the script , which Ford adapted from the 1993 novel " Tony and Susan " by Austin Wright .

Both of them feature tormented protagonists . <p> Things go very wrong in the books story , and this leads to the introduction of Bobby ( Michael Shannon ) , a Texas cop who enters the film with a memorable shot a pose that takes in him with a white cowboy hat , a long rifle , and a cigarette amidst a stark and beautiful Western environment who tells Tony ( Gyllenhaal ) , " I look into things around here .

He s also as laconic as he is scary , ever ready to threaten a criminal suspect by getting right up into his face . The crime that 's committed in the book is horrific . Fortunately for viewers , its never shown .

They are infants or toddlers under whose clothing or strollers the stolen items are stashed . <p> But there also is a smaller subset : adults who use older kids as outright accomplices in shoplifting . This latter problem became an issue here locally this week when Ocala police accused a woman and her boyfriend of inducing the womans 12-year-old daughter to help them steal clothing from the Wal-Mart on Southwest 19th Avenue Road . <p> The girl had the unusual distinction of being both a suspect and a victim in one single criminal experience : Police arrested the girl and charged her with theft , and then charged her mother with both theft and contributing to the delinquency of a minor . <p> The mom bonded out of jail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ State Attorneys Office will decide what charges , if any , to lodge against the suspects . <p> *** <p> How often do older kids actually get arrested in connection with adult shoplifting enterprises ?

" The average loss was $377 per shoplifting incident , up nearly $60 from 2014 , " the federation reported . <p> The National Association for Shoplifting Prevention says that " more than 10 million people have been caught shoplifting in the last five years .

According to the terms of the ordinance , these registered abusers can not own , work or live with animals for as long as they remain on the list . <p> If they violate these terms , they would be subject to a fine of up to $500 . <p> While Molly , an American boxer mix who survived a high-profile attack locally in 2014 , dozed in the auditorium aisle of the McPherson Governmental Complex as commissioners passed her namesake law , advocates of Mollys Law greeted the move with significantly more enthusiasm . <p> " I 'm beyond excited , " said Linda Little Wolf , who spearheaded the push for an animal abuser registry . " I 'm very proud of Marion County @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Change Animal League , likewise said she is pleased to see the registry pass in Marion County . But , like Little Wolf , she said she hopes to see the local registry as part of a larger movement . <p> " It needs to be a first step , " Kirkland said . <p> Marion Countys registry comes on the heels of a similar registry passed in Hillsborough County , which is set to take effect in November . While advocates continue to push for additional registries in other Florida counties , Little Wolf said the ultimate goal is to build momentum for a statewide registry . <p> Mollys Law first came in front of the Board of County Commissioners for consideration in March , when its advocates proposed the Marion County Sheriffs Office as the agency that would host and maintain it . Capt . Alicia Walker , speaking as a representative of that agency in March , said the Sheriffs Office would be on board . <p> The Board of County Commissioners asked the county attorneys office to work through details and come back with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to recent shakeups at the Sheriffs Office . <p> Sheriff Emery Gainey took over for former Sheriff Chris Blair in May , after the State Attorneys Office filed a perjury charge against Blair and he was suspended by Gov . Rick Scott . <p> The ordinance passed on Tuesday instead looks to a third-party agency , such as the Humane Society of Marion County , to maintain the animal abuser registry . The county administrator is expected to select the maintaining agency prior to Jan. 1 , when Mollys Law will take effect . <p> Mollys Law is set to cover only unincorporated Marion County , although an interlocal agreement with Ocala or other municipalities within the county could eventually widen its scope . <p> It calls for each registered abuser to pay $125 to cover the cost of maintaining the database . It also calls for registered abusers to remain on the list for three years in misdemeanor convictions , five years in felony convictions and 10 years for subsequent misdemeanor or felony convictions . <p> The board spent more than an hour discussing the details of the ordinance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ involving penalties for those who provide animals to registered abusers . Mollys Law calls for the county to levy a fine of up to $500 on anyone who knowingly sells , exchanges or transfers ownership of an animal to a registered abuser . <p> The board , along with Deborah Horvath of Marion County Animal Services , agreed that the county does not have the intention nor the resources to actively seek out everyone who provides an animal to a registered abuser . This would become particularly tricky , as commissioners acknowledged in their discussion , in the sort of informal exchanges that happen , for example , when a family pet has a litter of puppies . <p> Commissioner Carl Zalak , in particular , questioned the wisdom of passing an ordinance that the county would not or could not enforce .

The board on Tuesday set up a separate list to keep track of those individuals . But , because the cases do not involve criminal convictions , this list would not be incorporated into the animal abuser registry and violators would not be subject to fines under Mollys Law . <p> Also not incorporated into the animal abuser registry would be defendants for whom judges withhold adjudication . This happened recently in a high-profile cat-hoarding case , for example . Circuit Judge Jonathan Ohlman sentenced Diana Darnaby to 40 months of probation on a felony animal cruelty charge , but withheld adjudication .

The vote would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as to his innocence or guilt . <p> The vote was initiated by Council President Jim Hilty , who said that he wanted Graham removed during the investigation . <p> His call for Grahams removal came after the lawyer for the three OPD officers complained to the council that as long as Graham was in a position of power , the investigation could be unfairly influenced and the three officers unduly pressured . <p> " I 'm not passing any judgment I 'm just trying to do the right by the citizens of ( Ocala ) , " Hilty said after his motion . <p> Hilty said that his move to suspend Graham was n't to punish the chief , but rather that the proposed suspension was " for his protection . Things can happen at both ends .

He also reiterated that " preferred charges " only means that the suspension is necessary " to preserve the integrity of the investigation . " The citys charter spells out how Graham can be suspended or fired and that the " preferred charges " route was the only mechanism for the suspension . <p> But Musleh argued that setting a special Friday meeting was rushing the process given that there werent any criminal charges or proof of wrongdoing . <p> " Right now , they 're only allegations , " he told a Star-Banner reporter after the meeting . <p> Guinn said Graham might very well step aside on his own without the necessity of a formal process .

She said his presence would be a " victimization " of her clients all over again . <p> During a news conference before the council meeting , Frank also said that Graham had tried contacting one of the three OPD officers by telephone three times on Sept. 15 , just a couple of hours after the grievance was filed . She said he also contacted one of the three when they entered the police department station on Pine Avenue . <p> Frank also asked that the council urge the mayor not to go to the police department station . <p> The mayor had visited the station during the beginning of each shift Tuesday and said he was planning to do the same Wednesday .

He said Graham was " admired " by his officers as well as " loved " by them and the allegations were having a negative impact on the department . Frank said that such comments showed the mayor could not be impartial . <p> But Guinn said he would still go to the station and no one had the authority to stop him . <p> " So that 's not going to happen , " he said . <p> He also said that Frank was trying to intimidate the council and that she made the grievance issue more about herself than her clients . Guinn said she had made the meeting " the Bobi Frank show " and that her clients were probably disappointed in her representation of them . <p> To that Frank quickly responded , " I 'm sure they 're disappointed in you too sir .

But the council agreed to allow Larkin to conduct the investigation . His law firm also does labor law work for the city . <p> After the vote , Guinn told the council they had overreacted to nothing more than a grievance by three officers . <p> " It just amazes me that an attorney can come up here and make allegations and intimidate the council to make ( the decision you did ) , " he said <p> " I do n't  know what neighborhood you grew up in .

Otherwise , those utility changes would have cost millions of dollars . <p> He said that part of the reason for the TimberRidge focus is because Munroe beds often go unused ; adding more at the main campus does n't  make much sense . During the summer months , Munroe may utilize only about 250 beds . During the winter , even when part-time northern residents come back to Marion County , Munroe usually fills no more than 350 . And with more procedures being performed on an outpatient basis , fewer beds will be needed for many services in the future . <p> " Our interest will be on TimberRidge . That 's where the need is , " he said . " This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> The proposed hospital would be on the 70-acre site TimberRidge site on State Road 200 just east of County Road 484 . <p> Despite a greater eye on west Marion , CHS still plans to honor its commitment toward the main campus as well as ensuring Munroe provides the best quality care there for its patients , Moore said . <p> To do that , CHS is still consolidating the hospitals imaging center , which will be operational in early 2017 . That will cost about $5.6 million . The next phase will include a 12-bed neonatal care center , a five-room obstetric observation center and renovations of its delivery facilities . The hospital still plans to expand its emergency room and parking . <p> In addition , CHS last year began leasing from the Hospital District the site of the former Blocker 's furniture building in the 1200 block of South Pine Avenue for $2 million . <p> Moore said that the ER expansion , imaging service improvements and parking next to the expanded emergency department alone will cost $27 million . <p> He said there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allow CHS to reach its $150 million commitment to the hospital district trustees . <p> CHS on Monday submitted documentation of its plans for TimberRidge to the state Agency for Health Care Administration ( AHCA ) . CHS has until Sept. 7 to submit its request for a certificate of need to AHCA , and the agency in turn has until Dec. 2 to make its initial determination . <p> The TimberRidge facility will include : <p> *An endoscopy facility <p> *Invasive and noninvasive catheterization lab <p> *Six operating rooms <p> *66 beds and the capacity to add 28 more . <p> *An additional 14 ER examination rooms for a total of 26 <p> *In-patient imaging and support services such as laboratory and pharmacy . <p> Originally built in 2002 , the TimberRidge foundation was designed to accommodate a hospital some day . But Munroe 's previous leadership scaled back and built only an ER facility . <p> TimberRidge is 12.4 miles from Munroe and about 7.7 miles from Ocala Healths West Marion Community Hospital . <p> Moore said that with nearby rehabilitation centers , nursing homes , retirement communities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to explode , population wise . " <p> Meanwhile , Moore is asking for community support for the hospital and asking area residents to fill out questionnaires at Munroe facilities about their experiences needing health care in west Marion County . <p> Because the proposed TimberRidge hospital is part of the lease agreement with the hospital district , the district trustees will need to sign off on the deal . <p> Moore said he pitched the plan late last month and the trustees endorse it . <p> " We have to have agreement with the district and we have it , " he said . <p> Cope said trustees had vigorous discussions among themselves after Moores presentation , and concluded that the growing need for healthcare was in west Marion . Cope also said that it was in the communitys best interest that CHSs lease of Munroe and its satellite facilities is successful . <p> Trustee meetings are open to the public , but private executive sessions are called to discuss competitively sensitive matters involving Munroe . <p> Cope also said that Moore told him that the TimberRidge area sees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and not as much indigent care . " <p> Cope said that adding private rooms to Munroes main campus would not meaningfully benefit the hospital . <p> Developing the TimberRidge site would " probably be the smarter play for them , " he said . <p> Cope said the trustees have some concerns that CHS could lose focus of the main campus , but as long as the trustees monitor Munroe , the medical center wont be neglected . In addition , CHS has already spent millions of dollars on the main campus , ensuring compliance with healthcare laws and improving standards and services . <p> " Building a facility out there will benefit everyone in Marion County in one way or another , " Cope said . <p> But Aaron Liberman , professor emeritus from the University of Central Florida 's Department of Health Management &amp; Informatics , said the trend toward smaller , 100-bed hospitals is not in the publics best interest . <p> Liberman said the public should take note of what services the proposed hospital wont offer . <p> Moore said the new TimberRidge hospital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cardiac surgery , burn , trauma or transplant surgeries . <p> Liberman said these are the kinds of service lines for which hospitals often do n't  get fully reimbursed and are not considered money makers .

Most every day , about 70 of the schools 1,700 students arrive late for class . <p> Two years ago , students stood in line and , one by one , had to face Johnson . They would explain about waking up late , forgetting a book bag or one of many other excuses . Johnson would chat for a minute and then give them a pass to class . <p> Sometimes it could take 10 minutes or so for a student to wait in line to check into school . But today , students use a new Tardy Kiosk to check themselves in when they arrive late . <p> The students just type their student number into a keypad and it spits out a note that allows them to go to class . Though the computer system is still in Johnsons office , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't  have to look Johnson in the eyes . <p> Last school year the Tardy Kiosk program was piloted at several schools , including Vanguard and West Port high schools . This year it is being used at all middle and high schools , with the exceptions of Marion Technical Institute and Hillcrest School . <p> The system is designed to get students to class rapidly for that valuable instruction time . <p> " I like it because all you have to do is type in your number and go , " said Vanguard junior Ashley Sesler , who arrived to school late on Friday . <p> The new kiosk is just one part of the districts detailed plan on improving attendance and reducing tardiness at all 51 schools . This is the second year of the movement . <p> Facing a five-year trend of rising absenteeism , the district launched a program in September 2015 to remind students and parents of the importance of attending school to maintain grades . <p> Last year the district called the campaign " Attendance Matters . " Using robotic phone calls to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on school marquees , the campaign proved to be a huge success . <p> In the 2014-15 school year , on average , 93.25 percent of all of the countys 42,500 students attended school . That meant 2,870 students were absent every day . The state average was 94.3 percent . <p> In the 2015-16 school year , during the first year of the campaign , the percentage improved to 93.88 percent , inching closer to the state average . <p> Though that may seem like a small increase , considering the improvement was only two-thirds of 1 percent , raw numbers change that perception . That percentage increase means 268 more students were in class each day in 2015-16 than in 2014-15 . That is nearly the number of students enrolled at Reddick-Collier Elementary School , which had 300 students last year . <p> The district will continue the program this year , but under a new name . That 's because the name " Attendance Matters " had been trademarked by a United Way group in Washington state . The district received a letter demanding that it stop using @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United Way of Benton &amp; Franklin Counties " each time it was used . Instead , the district just renamed the program " Attendance Counts . " <p> Kevin Christian , the school district spokesman , said after attendance dropped to 93.25 percent in 2014-15 , officials began looking at the numbers and realized how easy it was for a student to rack up absences . <p> At face value , a student missing two days per month did n't  seem like much . But when you add the days up over 36 weeks , that 's 18 days missed in the 180-day school year . <p> " That means they were missing 10 percent of the school year , and that is a lot of lost instruction time , " said Christian , adding every minute a student is in front of a teacher is crucial to student success . <p> Over the summer , the district analyzed the data from last year and learned that the program had made a significant impact on attendance . In 2014-15 , 19.1 percent of all students nearly 1 in 5 missed 10 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 17.97 percent in 2015-16 . <p> In elementary school , the program used incentives to get students to want to come to school . The Elks Club donated $2,000 to purchase incentives such as stickers , sticky notes , modeling clay and colored pencils . District officials said one Dunnellon Elementary students attendance rate rose from 73 percent in 2014-15 to 98 percent in 2015-16 thanks to incentives . <p> While the district took a kinder , gentler approach with students , enticing children to want to come to school , the district did the opposite when it came to parents , who are required by state law to get their children to school . <p> The county has the Truancy Intervention Partnership Program ( TIPP ) , which is a cooperative effort between the School Board , State Attorneys Office , Fifth Judicial Circuit , law enforcement , Department of Juvenile Justice , Arnette House , Youth and Family Services , and other community agencies . <p> The goal of TIPP is to provide early intervention services to families of students , who do not have regular school attendance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the number of parent cases rose to 680 , up from 415 in 2014-15 . The number of families petitioned to court for non-compliance increased from seven in 2014-15 to 21 in 2015-16 . Parents are learning that all stakeholders are serious about school attendance . <p> The data also showed that the program was very successful for elementary and middle schools . The high school data shows that students missing 10 days or more of school ticked up slightly in 2015-16 . Officials are now going to come up with more plans to target high school students . <p> " It is harder to get high school students to school , " Christian said . " By the second semester of school , some juniors and seniors just stop coming to school . " <p> The campaign , which was centered in Christian 's public relations office , won three state awards . The district received a prestigious medallion award from the Sunshine State School Public Relations Association . It also received two other top awards from the Florida Public Relations Association . <p> This year , the district @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , just after school gets started . Unlike last year , the district will promote it hard again in January when high school students attendance starts waning . <p> The Tardy Kiosk is an important factor in the mix , Christian said . Every extra minute of instruction time is valuable . So if a student who is late gets an extra five minutes in class each time he or she is tardy , it adds up over the course of a school year . <p> There are a few minimal cons to the new Tardy Kiosk system , such as computer glitches and other technical issues . Also , while the idea is to move late-arriving students faster to class , it does mean less interaction . <p> " It does take away from that time I once had to get to know the students , " Johnson said .

@@97887168 @2087168/ <p> Dana Demilio remembers the bad old days when her husband maintained the family 's traditional chlorine pool at their Fort Lauderdale home . <p> By Fred HiersStaff writer <p> Dana Demilio remembers the bad old days when her husband maintained the family 's traditional chlorine pool at their Fort Lauderdale home.Demilio knew she wanted a pool again when she moved to Marion County . But she did n't want the accompanying problems . " Sometimes ( Ralph ) added too much chlorine , sometimes too little , " she said , recalling one of those many issues.Sometimes the couple smelled of chlorine when they got out of their pool ; sometimes their swimsuits reeked of it . Sometimes their young son 's eyes turned red and burned from the pool 's chemicals.Then there were the regular runs to the store to buy more chlorine tablets and an armload of other chemicals that keep algae at bay and keep the water swimmable.So , when the Demilios moved to Meadow Wood Farm in Marion County , they opted for what 's typically called a saltwater pool.They wanted nothing that required @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neither do most other new pool owners , according to local contractors and pool service companies.Traditional chlorine pools are quickly becoming a thing of the past , said Ron Kessel , owner of Crystal Kool Pool Inc. , which builds about 15 swimming pools a month.Kessel said he ca n't remember the last time he built a traditional chlorine pool . He estimates about half of the private pools in Marion County are now saltwater , and that number will only grow as traditional pools are converted and more new pools are built on the saltwater model . " Every time I go out on assignment , people tell me they want a saltwater pool , " he said . " Even when we go to remodel a pool , they 're asking us about it . " Kessel said he saw the writing on the wall for traditional chlorine pools about eight years ago and started carrying the equipment for saltwater pools.He converts about 50 traditional pools each year to saltwater operations . " I 'm talking to a couple in New York and they wo n't be here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for them . And they want a saltwater pool , " he said.The reason for the change , most pool industry experts say , is the relative ease and affordability of maintaining saltwater pools.Saltwater pools were first developed in Australia during the 1960s and currently account for about 80 percent of all pools there , according to the Salt Institute in Alexandria , Va.They were first introduced in the United States during the 1980s and by the mid-1990s , as the technology improved , started to become more popular.In 2007 , saltwater pools accounted for about 75 percent of new pool installations in the United States , up from about 15 percent in 2002 , according to the institute.Now for some basic chemistry.Although they are called saltwater pools , they work on the principle of converting salt to hypochlorous acid , which is the stuff that actually kills harmful bacteria.Saltwater pools convert salt and water , using an electric current , into chlorine and hydrogen gas and sodium hydroxide . The sodium hydroxide and chlorine then interact to form sodium chloride and hypochlorous acid , which is the stuff that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have large enough concentrations of salt for swimmers to taste it in the water.Depending on how the salt is added to the pool , the process reaches a salt saturation point of about 3,200 parts per million ( ppm ) , roughly the amount of salt found in a teardrop . In contrast , ocean water has a salt concentration of 35,000 ppm.Traditional chlorine pools require chlorine tablets , which already include chlorinating agents that react with water to form hyperchlorous acid . In those cases , no salt is added by the pool owner.Kessel said the demise of traditional chlorine pools is well underway . No one is interested in the chemistry , he said ; rather , they are attracted by the work load : Owners must only add a bag of salt , and the chemical cost is only a fraction of what it costs for a traditional pool , he said.Here are the numbers:The typical cost for pool chemicals in a traditional pool range between $25 and $40 per month , most industry experts agree.With saltwater pools , " every six weeks , dump a bag @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : less than $10 per month.The cost to build a saltwater pool is also almost identical , Kessel said.A traditional swimming pool , which is 14 feet by 28 feet , costs about $20,000 . A saltwater pool costs about $1,000 more for the additional equipment that 's needed for the salt conversion.Kenny Vazquez , vice president of Central Florida Swimming Pools in Ocala , said even though saltwater pools were being built at least 20 years ago here , it took time for them to become popular with other pool owners . It took word of mouth and people experiencing saltwater pools for themselves before either converting their traditional chlorine pools to saltwater or building them from scratch , he said.And without many of the chemicals that make up the chlorine tablets , such as stabilizers and fillers , the water in saltwater pools feels more natural to many swimmers , Vazquez said.He also thinks traditional pools are on their way out.If the pool was built in the past five years , he said , odds are it 's a saltwater pool.There are more than 1 million private swimming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Spa Professionals , a trade organization . That 's one pool for almost every 19 people in the state.In Florida , about 10,400 swimming pools were built last year , according to the same organization.In Marion County , about 40 percent of people looking to buy a home ask for a pool , said Duke Rountree , president of the Ocala/Marion County Association of Realtors and owner of Rountree Realty Corp . in Fort McCoy.For Alvara Mendoza , president of the United Pool &amp; Spa Association , a trade group in Florida , the decision about whether to select a saltwater pool comes down to simplicity.Saltwater pools add a steadier supply of chemicals into the water than do traditional chlorine pools , he said.Traditional pools have a higher chlorine level when new chlorine tabs are added and after the tablets shrink , the chlorine levels fall , Mendoza said.And salt is also fairly pH neutral , assuring that the chlorine is effective in pool water , he said.But saltwater pools have their shortcomings , he said . For example , it takes more time for chlorine levels to build @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contrast , traditional chlorine pools allow the user to add chlorine directly into the pool and more quickly increase those levels . " But the problem with saltwater systems is really that they 're oversold , " Mendoza said.People are told they only have to throw a bag of salt in the pool and be done with it , he said . In fact , owners still have to check acidity levels , ensure there 's enough salt in the system , and check other chemical factors of the water . " It 's a lot more bullet proof ( than traditional pools ) but many saltwater pool owners never check any of the levels , " Mendoza said.Mike Folsom , owner of Mike Folsom Construction LLC in Ocala , builds about 25 custom pools a year . The last time he built a traditional pool was two years ago.He too thinks the days of traditional pools are a thing of the past . And when helping customers decide whether they should build a traditional or saltwater pool , Folsom said the decision is always the same . " Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a no brainer .

But this is the park 's last summer . <p> After a tumultuous few years , the 38-year-old water park is scheduled to close for good on Sept. 5 . It will be razed and the property will be repurposed as a gateway into neighboring Silver Springs State Park and other natural areas , said Martha Robinson , communications manager with the state Department of Environmental Protection . <p> The DEP owns Wild Waters and Silver Springs . The state took control of the parks in 2014 , vowing to return Silver Springs to a more user-friendly nature park with the focus being the breathtaking natural resources . So the state has struggled with what to do with the aging Wild Waters and its web of flumes , pools and food stands . <p> The plan to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after the state took over in 2014 , there were a series of public workshops .

" Therefore , it was recommended that Wild Waters should be phased out of the operation of the park over time . Closing Wild Waters is included in the Unit Management Plan . " <p> Concessionaire BG Florida State Parks , operating as Silver Springs Management , has been running Silver Springs and Wild Waters for the state since 2014 , but its contract runs out this fall .

Headed by Canadian businessman and part-time Marion County resident Bobby Genovese , the company also operates three other state parks in South Florida ( Hugh Taylor Birch , Mizell-Johnson and Oleta River ) . <p> " The past two summers have gone well , " White said of Wild Waters . " The first two years , it was a lot to figure out the inner-workings of Wild Waters and how to properly operate it . It 's an older park , but is a great park .

White said the biggest challenge was finding events and attractions that pulled people into the park . He said they tried volleyball , animal shows and truck-pull competitions , which did not bring in big numbers . This summer , the park launched weekly evening parties . Teen nights tinkered out , he said , but the Sip and Slide parties for adults were a big hit . <p> " We 'd have at least 300 to 500 people out every single week . We had a great DJ and great live music , " White said . <p> The DEP 's contract with BG Florida State Parks ends Sept. 30 .

To completely cut it out and revamp the park , it was just deemed too high of a cost for everybody . " <p> Some Wild Waters fans are not letting go without a fight , though . A local man named Anthony who did not want his last name used in print launched a petition and online campaign to save Wild Waters . Since 2014 , he said , the petition has more than 3,400 signatures . Anthony adores the park , but his biggest frustration is the lack of response from public officials ; the DEP , he feels , is making all the decisions with no input from taxpayers . <p> Anthony 's website with a link to the petition is wildwatersfans.com ; his Facebook page , Save Wild Waters Ocala Fl , has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two Save Wild Waters Facebook pages . <p> White understands such emotional attachment to the park .

It was a simple civil ceremony at a courthouse in Liberty , Ohio on Rudy 's 21st birthday.Nearly 50 years later , following two children , seven grandchildren and two great-grandchildren , the couple divorced , for no other reason than that they could n't afford the costs of Emily 's weekly $2,800 chemotherapy treatments for terminal bone cancer.After learning from a friend that by dissolving their marriage Emily could qualify for Medicaid , the couple walked into a drugstore , picked up a guidebook on dissolutions and then marched into an Ohio courthouse in February 2005 , their $75 divorce petition in hand . " He ( the judge ) told us , This was the first . I 've never given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' " Rudy Friece recalled.Medicaid , the combined state and federal program that provides health coverage for low-income individuals , sets a limit on the amount of assets a person may have before qualifying for help . The asset limit to qualify for Florida Medicaid 's medically needy program is $5,000 for individuals and $6,000 for couples.It 's been easier for a single person to get help under the rules . That is , until recently . Now , as of July 1 of next year , it wo n't even help to go to this drastic measure because of cuts to the state budget.The Florida Legislature plans to discontinue Medicaid payments to the medically needy , excluding pregnant women and children , and the elderly and disabled a group that contains 40,000 individuals effective July 1 , in order to save the state nearly $700 million.Divorce , if only on paper , was always a last resort , said Friece , a 72-year-old retired truck driver who moved to Silver Springs following his wife 's death two years ago . " She would cry about it . She did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had no choice . She was getting worse and worse , and finally she agreed to it , " he said . " After it was done , it was done . I took care of her up until the very end . " The Frieces are part of a small but growing number of elderly or low-income couples who have felt the need to dissolve their marriage in order to qualify for government-funded health coverage for a sick spouse . An Aug. 13 New York Times article pointed out the regularity with which some couples are jumping into marriage or considering divorce so a partner can benefit from health coverage.Some elder law experts say eligibility requirements for receiving certain types of Medicaid coverage can be extremely difficult to meet , but express wariness over couples ' willingness to divorce for medical reasons . " That 's a sad day when that becomes a viable option , " said John Clardy , a Citrus County lawyer . Ocala-based attorney Shari K. Player equates the cuts to a " death sentence " for those who can not afford health insurance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " she asked.Silver Springs resident David Rowley and his wife of 13 years , Debra , divorced nearly four years ago so she could receive Medicaid coverage for her chronic obstructive pulmonary disease . Debra Rowley 's trips to the Belleview Clinic were costing $90 a visit , and her twice-monthly medications were upwards of $100 to $190 . " When we got divorced , she got food stamps and medical assistance , " Rowley , 55 , said . " All medications were free and she got to go to Gainesville for MRIs . " Rowley , a Vietnam veteran who works as a truck driver , said he had been informed by a state worker at Marion County 's Social Security Office that the couple owned too many shared assets for his wife to qualify for Medicaid coverage . Together they owned two vehicles , a motorcycle , a vacant lot in the forest and a traveler trailer , mostly items they could not do without.If they divorced , Rowley was told , his wife 's chance of meeting Medicaid eligibility requirements would vastly increase . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd be soulmates , forever and forever . But we could n't afford to go to doctor any more and could n't afford medication , " Rowley said.Even after their divorce , the couple lived together but their relationship was threatened by growing tensions.Last month , Debra Rowley , 50 , was found guilty by a jury of attempted second-degree murder for plowing her car , in a fit of jealous rage , onto a mobile home porch where her ex-husband and his friend were having a drink . She could be sentenced up to 15 years in prison on two felony counts this Friday.During deliberations , the jury asked the court what led the Rowleys to divorce in the first place . Because Circuit Judge David Eddy did not allow the defendant 's long medical history to come into the trial , the jury 's question was never addressed.Clardy , who specializes in elder law , said nothing in the law prevents such types of divorce from happening . " If you 're a single person and do n't have a lot of assets , you can get on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ca n't get divorced for Medicaid , " he said.In the Rowleys ' case , the Marion County magistrate judge who signed off on their divorce was momentarily taken aback when David Rowley let slip that he had not yet moved out from his wife 's home . " She looked at me and said , Well , who am I to say ? Some people get along better when they 're divorced than when they 're married , " ' he recalled.The resulting stigma of such a legal remedy can leave some spouses , especially those who have been married for decades , feeling stung and conflicted.After their divorce , Emily Friece wrote a letter to the Ohio judge who approved her dissolution and explained the reason why she felt the need to take the step in the first place.Rudy Friece , who first met his wife at a roller skating rink , tried to reassure her . " The only thing that ( the dissolution ) is , is a piece of paper . We still got a married life , " he told her . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a thing in her name , " he said.Rowley feels embittered by what he considers a helpless situation . " Our health care and medical system for people is absolutely a joke . You work all your life , then whenever you need something , you ca n't get anything . You have to be a nothing in order to get anything , " he said.Rowley , who now works for Lowe 's as a delivery driver " a good job with good benefits " said he would do it all differently if he could . " I 'd marry her again , right back , right now , " he said.Suevon Lee may be reached at **25;1963;TOOLONG or 867-4065.

The county is known for its retirement communities and emerging single-family home developments . During those six pre-recession years , seven large shopping plazas , several Walgreens and CVS drug stores , dozens of national chain retailers , two hospitals and many restaurants opened or expanded along that stretch of highway . <p> By 2008 , The Market Street at Heath Brook , a large scenic complex of retail stores , had just opened west of I-75 . Officials had signed anchor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Noble . Then the recession gained a grip and business expansion stopped , leaving dozens of smaller storefronts vacant . <p> From the Market Street development west to CR 484 , business owners waited patiently for the recession to fade .

In terms of population growth : " Its not at light speed , but steady growth , " he said . <p> Economic officials say grocery stores are the first businesses to build in growing communities , especially in post-recession America . People need food and grocery stores fare well in slower economies . <p> " Grocery stores are the hubs of communities , " Rison said . <p> Developers love to anchor plazas with grocery stores , which makes adjacent retail space much more valuable . Grocery stores attract traffic , often foot traffic , to those other businesses . <p> That is why construction of the Wal-Mart Neighborhood Market and Aldi is significant . Economic experts say that once a community grows large enough to attract grocery stores , restaurants tend to follow . Then you have specialty stores @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thereafter . <p> Rison said when Publix moved from Steeplechase Plaza to the newly constructed Canopy Oaks Plaza in 2008 , it was the beginning of the recession . That was when other grocery store chains stalled their plans and took notes . Those competing grocery store chains watched to see how Publix fared through the recession . If Publix did well , then other types of grocery stores could survive in the same general area . <p> Once competitors noticed Publix was thriving , officials began making plans to join the fray . Those plans are now quickly coming to fruition . Rison described the grocery store variety to the hotel and motel industry . Each grocery store chain provides different levels of service to meet the changing needs of the areas customer base . <p> Many people who shop at Publix may not shop as much at Aldi or Save-A-Lot , and vice versa .

The resolution will be placed on Tuesdays agenda as an emergency item , which will be when the board can legally vote on it . <p> The resolution states that transgender people are " not a protected class under federal or state law or under Marion County Public Schools ( MCPS ) policy .

Phillips said his sons right to privacy was being violated . <p> The Fourth Amendment states that people have the right " to shield ones body from exposure to viewing by the opposite sex . " <p> Phillips said he was pleased with Thursdays decision . <p> Stacy supported the ban because national court rulings on transgender issues have centered around Title IX issues , not Constitutional .

Only one person spoke on behalf of the transgender community . <p> The incident came to light at Vanguard High School when a teacher discovered that a transgender student was using the boys restroom instead of the one designated for the students birth sex and contacted Principal John Kerley . <p> At first , the district asked the student , and his parents , if he would instead start using a non-gender , single toilet bathroom .

Sheilley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Economic Partnership . <p> The crown jewel of the new year is almost certain to be the opening of the FedEx Ground hub . Jesse Bull , public relations manager with FedEx ground , said on Dec. 23 that the company is on track with plans for the Ocala hub , set for 176 acres north of U.S. 27 and east of Interstate 75 . <p> Company officials say the 400,000-square-foot facility is scheduled to open in August , with a projected employment of about 350 . The facility will join FedEx 's network of 560 facilities and is to process 15,000 packages per hour , " 45,000 per hour if fully expanded . " Its delivery boundaries are to be High Springs to the north ; Webster to the south ; U.S. 17 to the east and Florida 's coast to the west . <p> Marion County is " in great shape " for FedEx 's arrival , Sheilley said . <p> " What we have to be looking at is the companies that are going to be locating here once FedEx is here , " he said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think , as we start looking at the new logistics academy at MTI and the growth of the programs in logistics at CF , I think really , over the last couple of years , the community 's begun putting into place those pieces .

Bill Kearns of Ocala 489 LLC is developing land north of FedEx for commercial use . <p> Bartow McDonald IV , managing partner of Sperry Van Ness Commercial Real Estate in Ocala , said that may be just the beginning . <p> " There 's very little quality industrial inventory left in our market , " McDonald said . " I think that we will see new speculative industrial properties coming out in the next 18 months . " <p> Sheilley agreed . " Even smaller buildings that were on the market , in that 5,000- to 15,000-square-foot range ? " he said . " They 're not there anymore . They 've been flying , selling quickly .

" <p> " I think small , family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said . " Some of the consumers are doing the same thing . The one thing : The low-interest-rate environment has given people an opportunity to do is reduce their debt .

Hooters is expected to return to Marion County after several years ' absence , in a location near Hollywood 16 that has seen a string restaurants and clubs open and fail . Meanwhile , fans of Mojo Grill hope to see its east location in the former Horse &amp; Hounds on East Silver Springs Boulevard open soon . <p> One new restaurant sure to get attention is Burger 21 on East Silver Springs Boulevard .

" They are more demanding . <p> " I know I 'm in that category , based on experience , and I think other operators who are quality-driven in our community , will stand up and say the same type of thing and they will also succeed , " DePasquale said . <p> CORRIDOR OF GROWTH <p> McDonald of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 200 west of I-75 . On the way is one of Wal-Mart 's smaller-concept Neighborhood Markets . <p> " We 've seen in the vacant land parcels our clients own in front of Heath Brook a lot more activity , " he said .

A native to the southeastern United States , the muscadine performs well in a variety of Florida soils . <p> By David HolmesColumnist <p> Among the easiest fruit crops to produce for Florida gardeners is the muscadine grape . A native to the southeastern United States , the muscadine performs well in a variety of Florida soils . These are attractive to gardeners because they are not subject to damage from late-season frosts , and because they are tolerant of insect and disease pests , they can be successfully grown in home gardens without the use of pesticides . An abundance of flavorful fruit is produced in late August , provided grapes have been adequately cared for . Before growing them , there are a few characteristics that should be noted . While the flavor is outstanding , these grapes are not eaten as easily as the bunch grapes you might purchase at the local grocery store . Muscadines have a thick skin that most people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four seeds , so eating them is not as simple as popping one in your mouth , chewing and swallowing . This is especially of note for parents with young children . Having recognized there are inconveniences in eating muscadine grapes , those who grow them and take time to eat carefully will be rewarded with excellent flavor for fresh consumption , grape juice or wine . Annual pruning , irrigation as needed and light fertilization are required . Muscadine grapes can be planted in an arbor configuration or in a traditional post-and-wire system , as you might see in commercial production . If electing the post-and-wire system , space plants 12 to 20 feet apart . Training is a critical element in preparing the grapes for long-term production . After planting , a single , vertical shoot is trained , using a stake , until it reaches the top wire . Normally , side shoots will emerge , and these should be pruned off to concentrate growth on the vertical shoot , but do not remove the leaves growing directly on the trunk . Once the central vine grows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to facilitate the growth of two side branches to either side of the wire . Vines planted in spring should have cordon ( scaffold vines extending from the trunk ) completed during the first growing season . Irrigation will be needed to supplement rainfall . Grapes are blooming and fruit is growing during the spring , which is typically a dry time in North Central Florida . Supplement with 1 inch of water weekly during dry weather . In my own grapes I have found it expedient to run a second wire , 2 feet above the ground , for the location of flexible irrigation tubing . Micro jet emitters , two 180-degree fixtures on either side of the trunk , are affixed to the tubing to place water on the plant root system . In order to maximize production , grapes will need to be pruned annually , sometime between mid-January and mid-March . First , remove any shoots that grow on the main trunk . Along the vine or cordon , the standard rule is to allow two to four node spurs spaced alternately every 6 inches , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each successive year , leaving three or four node spurs , because fruit is produced on the new growth . Over time , the new nodes that are selected each successive year are further and further from the cordon . Nodes that emerge on spur locations that are too far from the cordon eventually lose productivity and also result in a vine that is more difficult to manage . To resolve this problem , spur renewal is recommended every three to six years so that new fruiting wood never arises more than a foot from the cordon . Spur thinning can be accomplished by removing entire spurs or part of them , back closer to the vine . After five to 10 years , it is not uncommon for cordons to lose vigor . When you reach this point , select another young shoot to train along the wire . It will become your cordon the following year . As with all crops , fertility management begins with soil testing . Fertilization should be based on reported soil fertility needs . Standard recommendations for grapes are to fertilize with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as possible , i.e. , 8 percent nitrogen , 0 percent phosphorus and 8 percent potassium . For young vines , fertilize soil with +-pound fertilizer in April after growth begins . Apply the fertilizer in bands about 1 foot to either side of the vine . Repeat this process in June and in August . The second year , using the same method , apply one pound of fertilizer in March and again in June/July . In future years , the fertilization rates can increase to three pounds of fertilizer during March and June/July . Grapes offer excellent tasting fruit and are not subject to the difficulties many fruit crops experience from late-season cold snaps . For home growers , they produce consistently if they receive proper care , and they are an excellent selection for those wishing to produce fruit . David Holmes is Marion County extension director .

Ribaut and his men then sailed north and discovered the mouth of the St. Johns River ( which he named the River May ) , where he erected a marble column claiming the land in the name of the King of France . <p> The French next sent a full-fledged colonial expedition to Florida under Rene de Laudonniere in April of 1564 .

At first , the colony prospered , and Laudonniere sent exploration parties into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make contact with the native groups in the area . One of these expeditions traveled up the St. Johns to near the mouth of a tributary believed to be the Ocklawaha River , where the Frenchmen found several Acuera settlements . <p> According to " Ocali Country " by Eloise Ott and Louis Chazal , the French described these natives as being " splendid physical specimens . " They tended their fields well , and food supplies were abundant . They took fish and game easily from streams and forests . The natives also fortified their towns by walls constructed from palm tree trunks and cut roads between the towns through the forests . <p> Religious beliefs of the Acueras were said to be based on the worship of the stars and moon , but their special deity was the sun . The Acuera lived in " the kingdom of the sun " and held a special ceremony each spring to make offerings to this supreme god , according to Ott and Chazal . <p> In reaction to this new French colony in Florida , the Spanish formed an expedition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ de Aviles . <p> In May of 1565 , Ribaut sailed from France with a relief fleet for Fort Caroline . In June , Menendez sailed from Spain for Florida with 10 ships and more than 1,000 men , hoping to beat the French to Fort Caroline . These two groups were on a collision course over the control of Florida 's future . <p> Menendez landed near Cape Canaveral in August . He then sailed north and drove the French fleet under Ribaut away from the mouth of the St. Johns and Fort Caroline , but he found he could not attack the French settlement from the sea because sandbars blocked the mouth of the river and prevented his ships from sailing in to attack . <p> The Spanish leader then turned his ships south to build his own base of operations , and on Sept. 8 , 1565 , he founded the town of St. Augustine and placed the land around it under Spanish royal authority . Menendez and his men quickly started building their fort around a long house given to them by Saloy , the chief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his men failed to displace the Spanish in an attack on St. Augustine a few days later , and the French fleet was then scattered by a strong storm . Menendez then moved his force north by foot and captured Fort Caroline on Sept. 20 , renaming it San Mateo and leaving a garrison to defend it . <p> Ribaut 's fleet was shipwrecked as far south as Cape Canaveral by the storm . Eventually , two groups of survivors marched north and established a camp on an inlet south of St. Augustine and prepared to attack the Spanish settlement . Menendez heard of the French camp and led his men there to attack before the French had a chance to organize . The Spanish leader persuaded the entire French force to surrender . Menendez then had his enemies beheaded , and from that day on , the little inlet would be known as Matanzas , meaning " place of slaughter . " <p> After surviving a lack of supplies and a near mutiny during that first harsh winter in St. Augustine , Menendez sent several expeditions into the interior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the St. Johns River , and Menendez noted the presence of the Acuera towns the French had discovered earlier . <p> Menendez sailed with 100 men aboard three ships into Lake George , hoping to find the source of the St. Johns . They also wanted to find out if a shortcut to Mexico existed across Florida . Menendez and some oarsmen were forced to take three small boats to continue their journey when the river got too shallow for the larger vessels . He and the others were forced back at the narrowing of the river near present-day Astor , when Acuera archers attacked . The Acuera also effectively blocked this narrowing with a barrier of logs . <p> Menendez ran into several problems , especially with the natives in Florida , leading him to return to Spain to seek help from the crown . He fell i 'll with typhus during an epidemic and died on Sept. 17 , 1574 . His son-in-law then attempted to run the Florida colony . After he failed , the king took back the colonial charter , making Florida a crown colony , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pedro Menendez de Aviles , as the new governor . The Menendez Marques family would eventually hold large tracts of land in the interior of Florida , including most of the cattle grazing lands of La Chua ( Paynes Prairie ) in present-day Alachua and Marion counties . <p> The Spanish attempt to rule by the sword had failed ; now they would attempt to rule by the cross . <p> Spain 's King Philip II issued three sets of laws in 1573-74 , meant to enlarge and set the direction of governing his American empire . These new laws -- the Ordinances of Pacification , the Ordinances of Patronage and the Ordinances of the Laying Out of Towns -- marked the end of the conquest period in Spanish America . All future expansion would be directed by the crown through the Roman Catholic Church , not the military . <p> A chief goal of these laws was to end the practice of enslaving native populations by the military and the profiting from the sale of the people . The military 's business would no longer be advancing the frontier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been given the role of expanding the empire 's control over new lands and new people . <p> These new laws and policies encouraged members of the Franciscan order to begin new missions in the Americas . <p> Spanish Florida would never lose its flavor as a military outpost during the 1600s . But the colony did enjoy two periods of expansion that developed a hinterland of productive mission towns . <p> In 1587 , St. Augustine became the permanent capital of the colony of Florida . A diverse population began to develop in the coastal presidio , with the men of the permanent garrison taking native wives and having mestizo children . Individuals of African origin added to the mix , as slaves and , eventually , free blacks made up a large contingent . Many of the slaves brought to St. Augustine escaped and joined nearby Timucuan societies . St. Augustine also became home to several European nationalities . <p> St. Augustine also functioned as a penal colony , and several of its soldiers and settlers were " involuntaries " with criminal records sent to the frontier to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mexico . As a seaside presidio , St. Augustine was the only coastal station along 600 miles of vital Spanish sea lanes . Frigates from the port protected the ships in the Fleet of the Indies plying the Gulf Stream just 60 miles offshore . These frigates also traded with Cuba and Mexico , took dispatches to Spain and showed the flag to and traded with the natives up the St. Johns River and in other Florida harbors . <p> Franciscan missions were created along Florida 's east coast and up the St. Johns from 1587-1620 , a period known as the " nearer pacifications . " The St. Johns area was divided into the tidewater ( agua salada ) and the freshwater ( agua dulce ) districts to deal with the various Timucuan-speaking tribes found in the region . These missions added Indian tribute and labor to the support of the development of St. Augustine . <p> Little is known of the first Franciscans who came to Florida in 1573 .

A mission station , or visita , where priest regularly said mass , also was located in the native town of Apalu on the western shore of Orange Lake . <p> Missions among the Acuera tribes were established around 1616 , along the Ocklawaha River . San Luis de Acuera and Santa Lucia de Acuera were closed by 1675 . About the same time the Acuera missions started , a mission was established among the Ocale along the Withlacoochee River to the east of the Tsala-Apopka chain of lakes . San Luis de Eloquale would disappear by 1655 , after a series of epidemics killed off at least 90 percent of the Ocale tribe . <p> These missions were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teach them European ways . They were also meant to supply the presidio of St. Augustine with food and naval stores for trade . The unintended but ultimate effect of these missions was to decimate in direct and indirect ways the natives they were built to serve . The subsistence lifeways of the Utina , Potano , Acuera and Ocale tribes were disrupted by the friars , who forced the natives into mission villages and turned them into full-time farmers . New crops and new animals were introduced that further changed the people and the land . <p> The natives quickly became a reliable source of labor and provided the Spanish colonists with supplies and foods the Europeans preferred and desired . <p> Concentrating the natives into mission towns made them much more vulnerable to European crowd disease , to which they had little or no natural immunity . As a result , the numbers of Timucuan-speaking natives declined throughout the 1600s , until the north-central region of Florida was nearly depopulated by 1715 . The remnants of the mission natives were further reduced by a series of military invasions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The establishment of the Carolinas by the British in 1663 brought a new threat to Spanish Florida . This threat became a reality in 1668 , when the English freebooter Robert Searles sacked St. Augustine under a patent issued by the Jamaican governor . Searles and his men killed more than 100 people and gathered up anyone who looked Indian or African to be sold into slavery . <p> Then , in 1670 , the founding of Charleston by English settlers from Barbados forced the Spanish to increase their defenses of St. Augustine with the building of the Castillo de San Marcos between 1672 and 1695 . <p> England kept expanding the size of the Carolinas into Spanish Florida , and after Spanish protests and diplomatic threats , a compromise was reached with the Treaty of Madrid in 1670 . This established a boundary between Florida and the Carolinas about 10 miles north of the Savannah River and the present-day boundary between South Carolina and Georgia . This line then ran west through unexplored territory . <p> This boundary was observed more on paper than in practice . Most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time it satisfied officials in London and Madrid , but it was detested in Paris . France 's intentions in America were not clear . The gaining of the Mississippi and the Gulf was an act of exploration in the hopes the St. Lawrence-Great Lakes passage was connected to the Mississippi valley network of rivers . <p> Spain was in decline as a colonial power , and Florida had always been a neglected colony . England and France were newly dynamic nation-states that wanted the wealth and power Spain gained through colonization . With the construction of the Castillo de San Marcos and an increase in the size of the garrison at St. Augustine , Spain seemed to be trying to make a stand against her colonial competitors . <p> By 1682 , one of the problems the French were trying to solve with their American explorations was finding the mouth of the Mississippi River . Explorers like Rene-Robert Cavelier , sieur de La Salle , and Henri de Tonty had traveled most of the river but could n't find a recognizable estuary in the delta . France used buccaneers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the navigable mouth of the Mississippi . <p> It was one of these bands of buccaneers that raided the Spanish fort of San Marcos ( present-day St. Marks ) in 1682 . This same raiding party then sailed up the Withlacoochee River in small boats and attacked settlements in the interior . <p> One of the areas they attacked was a large cattle ranch among the Potano on the La Chua prairie owned by the Menendez Marques family . Descended from Juan Menendez Marques and Maria Menendez y Posada , two direct descendants of Pedro Menendez de Aviles , who founded St. Augustine in 1565 , the family maintained its position of power for more than 150 years in Florida through marriage , treasury offices , military positions , trade with Cuba and cattle ranching . Don Thomas Menendez Marques , who owned the ranch in La Chua by the time the French attacked , used the depopulated savannas of Alachua and Marion counties for his operation . He shipped tallow , hides and dried beef down the Suwannee and Santa Fe rivers and eventually all the way to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Augustine by wagon down the " camino real . " <p> This major source of food and stores for the capital was attacked by the French in 1682 , and the English incited various tribes from South Carolina and Georgia to raid it in 1685 and 1704 . The ranch had to be abandoned in 1706 . <p> Although this and other cattle ranches had to be abandoned by the Spanish throughout the interior of Florida , the longhorn range cattle were left behind . These animals quickly adapted to their new habitats and remained as wild herds . These scrub cattle became an important resource for the Seminoles and the first American settlers in what would become Marion County over the next 150 years . <p> By 1700 , the English were established in Carolina and were expanding west and south . The French were established in Louisiana and held the Mississippi River and Mobile Bay . The Spaniards were strengthening St. Augustine , building a new fort in Pensacola Bay and extending the mission system to the Apalachee and up the Apalachicola River . Then a fierce war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conflict spread to their colonies in America . <p> The War of Spanish Succession , 1702-13 -- known as Queen Anne 's War in America -- turned Florida into a battlefield fought over with an intensity never seen before or since . <p> In an attempt to unify in the face of growing English strength , the French claimed the Spanish crown with the death of King Charles II . This union threatened the rest of Europe and the English colonies in America from the north , west and south . This was especially true in South Carolina , were James Moore was the governor . <p> Moore was determined to destroy the Spanish threat in St. Augustine before it could be reinforced by the French . As soon as he had word the war had started , Moore led an army of 1,200 south . Half of the soldiers were English , and half were Moore 's Indian allies . By September of 1702 , this army easily occupied St. Augustine , burning most of the buildings .

Moore also sent for help to the English colony of Jamaica when it became obvious he could not capture the Castillo de San Marcos . The Spanish won the race when a relief fleet appeared off the coast on Christmas Day . The English quickly retreated back to South Carolina . <p> Moore , who lost his governorship because of his failure to take St. Augustine , turned his attention to the Spanish mission system in 1704 . British-backed Indian forces had been attacking the mission since the 1680s .

Most of the Apalachee and what was left of the Timucuans either voluntarily moved to South Carolina or were put into slavery by the English . <p> The missions not under the local protection of St. Augustine never recovered . By the end of Queen Anne 's War in 1713 , the population of Florida stood at less than 1,000 Spaniards and a like number of natives .

One of the groups settled into a town in what would become eastern Marion County near Silver Springs . They were called the Ocklawahas , and they gave their name to the river on which they settled . <p> The repopulation of Florida had begun . Later , Creek town groups from the Chattahoochee and Flint river areas in present-day Alabama and Georgia began pouring into the vacant lands of central Florida . It was these Creeks and other refugees who would become known as the people called the Seminoles . <p> The next major challenge to Spanish rule in Florida came about with the establishment of an English colony south of the treaty line established in 1670 . The area between the Savannah and St. Johns rivers , called the " debatable lands " by historian Herbert E. Bolton , was where the English established the colony of Georgia in 1730 . Under the leadership of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Savannah to the Altamaha rivers and west to the Pacific coast , not only encompassing lands in Spanish Florida , but also threatening northern Mexico . Oglethorpe soon extended his claims to the St. Johns River . <p> After a series of diplomatic negotiations , the Spanish governor of Florida agreed to a new border along the Altamaha River . The Spanish government disallowed the governor 's actions in 1731 , recalled him and strengthened the garrison at St. Augustine . <p> Georgia 's governor continued to strengthen his position by gaining several Indian allies . He knew armed conflict between England and Spain was inevitable , and he wanted to be prepared to capture Florida when war finally broke out . <p> Oglethorpe got his wish in October 1739 , when the two nations began the War of Jenkins ' Ear.Although Oglethorpe was a more competent leader than James Moore was in 1702 , and he led a trained militia force from Georgia and South Carolina along with numerous Indian allies , he failed in his mission to Florida just as badly as his predecessor had . Oglethorpe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of St. Augustine , including the free-black fort at Mose . But the Spanish governor , Manuel de Montiano , was able to stop the English force before it overran the capital.Without support from the Royal Navy , and facing distention in the ranks from his Indian allies and the leaders of the South Carolina militia , Oglethorpe was unable to crack the thorough St. Augustine defenses and gave up the siege when the Spanish were able to recapture Fort Mose in a lightning raid in June.By July 15 , the siege was lifted , and by Aug. 6 , the English were gone from Florida . <p> The English did not destroy their enemies in Florida , and the Spanish could not eliminate Georgia . St. Augustine was secure , with its sturdy , unconquerable fort . Forts Mose and Matanzas were strengthened , and the garrison increased in size . But outside of the capital and Pensacola , there was little Spanish development . Areas like La Chua and the Cove of the Withlacoochee quickly developed into the heart of the Seminole lands . <p> Eventually , Spain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war . At the end of the French and Indian War between France and England over the control of North America , Spain threw its lot in with France in 1762 . Almost immediately , English forces captured Havana , and to get Cuba back during the treaty negotiations , Spain handed Florida over to England . <p> The key to understanding England 's desire to own Florida stems from the ways Spain and England ruled their slaves . Ever since the founding of the Carolinas in 1663 , blacks had run away from the harsh methods of chattel slavery employed in the English colonies to the less harsh , more paternalistic system in Spanish Florida or freedom with native tribes . After 1693 , an increase in runaways came about with a change in Spanish law . Charles II began to grant escaped English slaves their freedom on the basis of a religious conversion to Catholicism . <p> As the number of fugitives in St. Augustine increased , the Spanish decided to establish the free-black town of Santa Teresa de Mose two miles north of the capital in 1738 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ central Florida , where they were welcomed for their agricultural skills . One of the biggest problems that developed between the English , and later the Americans , and the Seminoles was the status of these Black Seminoles . <p> With English rule of Florida looming in 1763 , many of the black residents of Fort Mose left for Cuba and Mexico with the Spanish , while others retreated into the interior and joined the Black Seminoles . <p> When the English officially took over Florida in 1764 , they split it into two colonies along the Apalachicola River . West Florida stretched all the way to the Mississippi and north to the Yazoo River above Natchez . East Florida included all of the peninsula to basically the northern border we have today . The capitals were located in Pensacola and St. Augustine . <p> The first governor of East Florida was James Grant , and his first order of business was increasing the population of the colony . Free land was offered , and South Carolinians rushed to grab thousands of acres north of St. Augustine . Finding labor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ By 1771 , Grant reported a white population of 288 and more than 900 black slaves . <p> Two unique attempts at establishing settlements occurred in East Florida . In 1768 , Andrew Turnbull enlisted more than 1,400 people from Mediterranean islands to work on his estate at New Smyrna on the Mosquito Inlet south of present-day Daytona Beach . Some of the colonists staged a mutiny , and Grant had to use military forces to suppress the uprising . Most of the immigrants died between 1768 and 1770 , and the settlement closed in 1777 . The survivors moved to St. Augustine , where a Minorcan influence is still felt today . <p> The other settlement started about 1768 , under the direction of Denys Rolle . Colonists brought to Rollestown -- on the St. Johns River across from present-day Palatka -- included London vagrants , beggars , debtors and prostitutes . This colony also failed because most its residents knew nothing about agriculture . <p> Despite the early setbacks , British East Florida discovered a route to economic viability by the early 1700s , including an infant citrus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important export , though , was indigo for the booming English textile mills that fueled the industrial revolution of the 18th and 19th centuries . <p> To grow indigo , the English had to import the system of chattel slavery found in South Carolina and began a similar plantation system in East Florida . Even those Spanish plantation owners who stayed behind began to adopt the English system of slavery . <p> Another source of income came from the growing trade with the Seminoles in deerskins needed for the leather industry . These ties were based on the English system of " one trader , one town , " and as a result , the Seminoles began to flourish and were recognized as a tribe separate from the Creeks in treaty negotiations with the English as early as 1765 . <p> Some of the most famous visitors to East Florida during British rule were the naturalists John Bartram and his son William Bartram . " Ocali Country " relates how John Bartram , a Philadelphia botanist , came into the area by way of the St. Johns . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new plants in Florida . In January 1766 , Bartram and his young son spent a long time exploring the west side of Lake George and visiting the two " fountains " known today as Silver Glen Springs and Salt Springs . <p> William Bartram returned to the area alone in 1773 , traveling up the St. Johns in a boat slightly larger than a canoe . His romantic tales of the Florida wilderness include accounts of his being attacked by alligators on Lake George and revisiting " William 's Spring " ( Silver Glen ) . Bartram landed at the mouth of the run out of the spring and passed through a grove of giant magnolias , oaks and towering pines . He then climbed up a steep shell embankment and recorded his sightings from the high ridge . He had " an almost endless view of a vast barren desert , altogether impenetrable so thickly overgrown with short scrubby Oaks , Bays , Yapon , Pinos and short laurel bushes . " <p> This was the " Big Scrub , " and the younger Bartram was the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ocala National Forest . <p> East Florida grew even larger in population during the American Revolution from 1775-1783 . Both Floridas stayed loyal to the British crown , and East Florida fought off an invasion of Georgians led by Lachlan McIntosh in early 1776 , and another invasion out of Georgia in 1777 . Both times the Seminoles were instrumental in defending the British colony . <p> Early in the war , both Charleston and Savannah fell to the rebels . Loyalist inhabitants from both South Carolina and Georgia fled to East Florida , many of them transplanting whole plantations . By 1783 , East Florida 's population had grown to 17,375 . <p> Britain transferred control of both Floridas back to Spain in the Treaty of Paris 1783 , which ended the Revolutionary War . Spain , although an ally of America during the war for independence , was much more acceptable to England as the ruler along the gulf than the fledgling country . And Britain ensured the upstart United States would not gain control of the Mississippi River or various gulf ports found in the two Floridas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taking it back , with the capital at St. Augustine . To the north was a young , aggressive United States looking to expand its boundaries . From 1783 to 1821 , Spain would lose Florida a piece at a time to the United States.When Spain regained Florida , it reinstated the sanctuary policy for escaped slaves first enacted in 1693 . English slaves took advantage of the confusion at the end of the Revolution to escape to the Seminole villages in central Florida . <p> Runaway slaves became the biggest problem between the United States and Spanish Florida . Not until 1790 was the U.S. able to pressure Spain into ending the sanctuary policy . But all escaped slaves who already claimed freedom in Florida remained free . Even with the sanctuary policy ended , blacks continued to run away from American slavery to the freedom found with the Seminoles in Florida . <p> In 1795 , residents of Georgia caught up in the fervor of the French Revolution invaded Florida , ostensibly to overthrow the " tyrannical " Spanish government . The attack was easily beaten back by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1803 , the U.S. began systematically taking over parts of West Florida . By the beginning of the War of 1812 , the U.S. had annexed all the land between the Mississippi and Perdido rivers . <p> During the War of 1812 , Spain was allied with England against Napoleon . Known as the " Patriot War " in Florida , the conflict opened the gates to the expansionist desires of the U.S. The war also allowed angry southern slaveholders a chance to take back their runaways and take control of the free blacks living in Spanish Florida . <p> Gen. George Mathews led a force of Georgia " Patriots " into Florida in the March of 1812 . They took over Fernandina and moved south to the site of the former Fort Mose . During the summer of 1812 , the Seminoles and their black allies entered the conflict . The Patriots then moved against interior lands occupied by the Seminoles . <p> The Independent Republic of East Florida was proclaimed in early 1814 , and a fort was built east of the Ocklawaha River near Lake Bryant . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Buckner Harris . The Patriots built a two-story , log blockhouse ( 25 feet by 25 feet ) , which was encircled by a heavy barricade of logs . The encampment was named for Gov . David B. Mitchell of Georgia . Thus , Fort Mitchell became the first building erected by citizens of the United States in what would become Marion County . <p> The fort was designed to be a base from which the Patriots could control the area , and eventually they planned to petition the U.S. government to claim the District of Elotchaway as part of the United States . President James Monroe declared the invasion illegal and rejected the Patriot 's petition in April 1814 . <p> Buckner Harris was killed by a group of Seminoles and blacks on May 5 , 1814 , and the remaining Patriots abandoned Fort Mitchell within two weeks of his death , ending the rebellion.Fort Mitchell was burned by the Seminoles after it was abandoned , but the stockade surrounding it was used as a meeting place in the Lake Bryant area for years . It was finally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during the 1880s . <p> As the War of 1812 was being fought between the United States , England and Spain , the U.S. also was fighting the Creek War in the Alabama Territory in 1813-14 . This Indian war began as an internal struggle between the Upper and Lower Creeks . U.S. forces under Maj. Gen. Andrew Jackson sided with the Lower Creeks , and this combined force defeated the Upper Creeks , made up mostly of the Red Stick band , at the Battle of Horseshoe Bend ( Tohopeka ) on March 27 , 1814 . Most of the surviving Red Sticks fled into Florida , and this would be the last major native migration into the peninsula . A mother and her son would be part of the refugee band of Red Sticks who settle in what would become Marion County . This boy would grow up to become the famous Seminole War chief Osceola . <p> Despite the defeat of the Patriots in 1814 , anarchy continued to reign on the Florida-Georgia border . This led to the First Seminole War in 1818 . Most of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Suwannee River , but Seminole refugees in the war fled south and east into north central Florida.This military action was led by Maj. Gen. Andrew Jackson , and it proved to Spain that the U.S. was able to control Florida . The war led directly to the cession of Florida to the United States . <p> Before Spain handed Florida over to the U.S. , the colonial governor in St. Augustine made several land grants that would affect how area would develop . These grants were meant to help strengthen the hold Spain had on the land , and 11 were made during 1817-18 , in what would become Marion County.Don Antonio Alvarez , the secretary to the governor in St. Augustine , was given 1,500 acres on the west side of the " Ocklawaha Creek . " The Alvarez Grant contains land that makes up much of the present-day east side of Ocala , including all of the Ocala Highlands subdivision . <p> Don Thomas de Aquiles received 2,000 acres south of Ocala on the same day the Alvarez Grant was made , Dec. 7 , 1817 . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Alvarez and Sanchez names live on to this day in Ocala as names of streets on the east side of downtown . <p> Gov .

This parallelogram-shaped tract is located just to the southeast of the Sanchez Grant and contains most of the Shady Road area south of State Road 200 today . The grant was made in compensation for the loss of her husband , who died during the defense of St. Augustine during the Patriot War . <p> In 1828 , the Hijuelos Grant was purchased for 75 cents an acre by Moses Elias Levy . He also acquired the adjoining , smaller grant to the north made to Don Gabriel G. Perpall for $1 an acre.Large grants were also made in the eastern part of what would become Marion County . Don Joseph Hernandez was given the land around Salt Springs and Salt Springs Run down to the shores of Lake George . Don Fernando de @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Springs and Juniper Run . <p> Two grants were made just north of present-day Ocala in the Lowell-Reddick area . The John Broward Grant lays just to the south of present-day Lowell , and the Stephen Fernandez Grant lays between Reddick and Fairfield to the northwest of Lowell . <p> Farther north were two more land grants . Good farmlands near Orange Lake and present-day Citra went to George J.F. Clarke , the Spanish surveyor , and his brother Thomas Clarke . Col. Duncan L. Clinch , the Second Seminole War leader , later bought most of the Clarke grants with his brother-in-law John Houston McIntosh Jr. , the man for which present-day McIntosh is named . Fort Drane was later built on a portion of the Clarke Grant . <p> West of Orange Lake in the northwestern part of Marion County was the lower part of the huge Arredondo Family Grant .

His son was David Levy Yulee , who would become one of Florida 's leading politicians and the point man in Washington , D.C. during the drive for statehood in the 1840s . The Yulee Sugar Mill , now a state park in Citrus County , was part of Moses Elias Levy 's many holdings . <p> The granting of large tracts of land did not secure Spain 's hold on Florida . The treaty ceding Florida to the United States was signed by Secretary of State John Quincy Adams and Spanish Minister to the U.S. Luis de Onis on Feb. 22 , 1819 .

Parents respected teachers , and students listened.It was a time when corporal punishment was the mainstay of discipline.That was then , and this is now.Three weeks ago , the Marion County School Board banned paddling from its menu of disciplinary measures in a move applauded by many educators , parents and disciplinary experts who say corporal punishment is less effective than methods that do n't rely on force and intimidation.They note that since the 1960s , educators enjoy a wider array of disciplinary tools tailored to address different kinds of student misconduct , including in-school suspension , alternative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's decision to abolish paddling say public school educators face more serious behavioral problems than ever before , and their ability to deal assertively with those problems has eroded over time.Supporters and opponents of corporal punishment agree on one thing , however : Many parents are no longer involved as much in their children 's education.They say parents are preoccupied with jobs , stressed by life events , overwhelmed by the complexity of the modern education system or are simply apathetic.As a result , these parents feel less connected to their schools and are less inclined than in past generations to be involved in their children 's learning . <p> Surprisingly , School District administrators say the percentage of children getting in trouble today is the same as it was decades ago . What has changed are the approaches to dealing with student misconduct.Many educators point to parents , who they say are less involved in their children 's education and less apt to help teachers rein in their unruly kids.Without the help of these parents , teachers are forced to rely on their own disciplinary tools .

When they called home about a discipline problem , parents addressed it . " Parents supported us much more back then , " Ely said . Nearly all parents attended open houses and conference nights , and dressed appropriately for the occasion.Ely said times were different in the 1960s . Most children had both parents at home . She said by the 1970s , it all began to change . More divorces led to many single-parent households.Marcy Weidner , 64 , a 34-year veteran who is retiring from Shady Hill , started out teaching in 1969 at a private school in an affluent Chicago neighborhood.There was no paddling , but parents were very involved . <p> When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a different culture .

This is an established privacy hedge , and I do n't want to lose this green wall between me and the neighbors . The leaves get spots and then fall off . Is there anything I can do ? A : Mirror leaf viburnum , or Awabuki viburnum , is a gorgeous evergreen hedge plant . Many folks are familiar with the normal viburnums such as the Sandankwa viburnum , sweet viburnum , or our native type , but the Awabuki viburnum is just a little more attractive with its 5-inch-long glossy leaves and upright growth habit . They can be susceptible to a downy mildew disease that is favored by high humidity and cool nights . Downy mildew blight first starts as large brown spots that merge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , curls up and drops to the ground . The spots are on the upper and lower sides of the leaves and the disease progresses quickly . Soon you will see large gaps in the hedge . As soon as you notice the problem , rake up the diseased leaves from the bottom of the plant and remove them from the landscape . This will help to prevent the spread of the disease back into the hedge . Also , notice where your irrigation is hitting the plants . If your sprinkler is hitting the foliage , redirect the spray so it does not come in contact with the leaves . Downy mildew is a water mold and will be spread by irrigation water . Then you will need to treat it with a fungicide like Heritage or Insignia . Repeat applications will be necessary to bring back the leaves to the hedge .

Consider the soil in your garden beds , the amount of sunlight , the temperature ranges in your area , and the amount of water you can provide . Buying a plant that requires a lot of water or one that will be heavily damaged by winter frosts can be very frustrating . To save yourself a lot of misery - just go native ! The following are a few of the native plants I have had in my gardens . 1 . OAKLEAF HYDRANGEA If you have a lot of shade , you may want to consider Oakleaf Hydrangea ( Hydrangea quercifolia ) . Once this plant has established itself , it will come back faithfully each year providing large , dramatic flowers and intense fall colors . This is a large plant ( five to six feet ) requiring rich , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a water source . 2 . CORAL BEAN PLANT My Cherokee or Coral Bean ( Erythrina herbacea ) plant was purchased in Mount Dora . This plant will freeze down in our climate keeping the shrub to a manageable three to five feet . In South Florida , the height can reach 20 feet . This plant blooms in the late spring or early summer presenting foot-long spikes filled with tubular two-inch red flowers . These flowering spikes last about two weeks , and the vivid red blooms are a favorite of hummingbirds . But beware as the red seeds are poisonous . 3 . STOKES ASTER The Stokes Aster ( Stokesia laevis ) is easy to grow and drought tolerant . Plant it where it will get a little shade in the afternoon . The plant , which grows up to two feet , has aster-like flowers that come in two colors - lavender and white . Its long-lasting blossoms are a source of nectar for butterflies . <p> 4 . CORAL HONEYSUCKLE Coral Honeysuckle ( Lonicera sempervirens ) is an excellent vine for fences , arbors and trellises @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Its small fruits also provide a display of color and are eaten by thrushes , orioles , mockingbirds , and other wild birds . The vines are not overly aggressive and are easy to maintain . Be careful not to purchase Japanese Honeysuckle as this vine is an aggressive grower and can be a nuisance . <p> 5 . SCARLET HIBISCUS My Scarlet Hibiscus ( Hibiscus coccineus ) was purchased this past fall at the Marion County Master Gardener 's Fall Plant Sale . This is a truly glamorous plant with large , bright red , showy flowers , four to eight inches in diameter , with five well-separated petals . The leaves are palmate veined and deeply divided into three to five lobes . This tall slender plant will grow in sunny or partly shady locations and prefers moist to wet conditions . The Scarlet Hibiscus will freeze down in the winter but will return year after year . <p> 6 . FIREBUSH One of my very first Florida purchases was a Firebush ( Hamelia patens ) .

BLUE PORTERWEED Blue Porterweed ( Stachytarpheta jamaicensis ) is a low ( three to four feet ) sprawling shrub that produces slender spikes on which quarter-inch tubular blue or purple flowers open and bloom year round .

They are 107 inches and had rectangular pieces cut out of rubber Sears and Roebuck automobile floor mats where they would have been under the boots . Of course , these were not Alpine skis , but were used as snowshoes , like cross-country skis with the heel not fastened down , so they could walk around the 8,600-foot-high town on top of several feet of snow in the winter . There were crumbling , old newspapers wrapped around them , and I could make out some mention of war activities and a major sea battle near the Philippines , so it must have been World War II .

This will somewhat explain my being in Telluride . B.McG. , Internet A : You have a beautifully carved statue of a young female nude , produced in Italy during the early 20th century . The overall detail and lifelike appearance is wonderful . It is likely the material is alabaster , which is much softer than marble , easier to carve and less expensive . Figural statues like this were produced in large numbers and are always of interest in the antiques marketplace . Unsigned statues like yours in marble sell in the $1,500-plus range ; in alabaster dollar values range from $600 to $1,200 .

The Farm currently has more than 3,000 trees in stock . The Valenza family has been growing olive trees in California for more than 80 years and decided to see if any of the varieties would survive and produce olives in the Central Florida area . They have test grown many varieties in the last five years and found at least three that do well in our area . They are Arbequina , Mission and Manzanillo . All three are self-pollinating , cold hardy to at least 12 degrees , and are pest and disease resistant . *-Arbequina - a smaller Spanish olive introduced to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ variety is the earliest of the three to produce fruit , some within three years . The olives grow in heavy clusters and have a high oil content .

" The Agency for Health Care Administration has totally changed the system , " said Sarah Stroh , executive director of Marion Senior Services , referring to Medicaid . " Statewide , it 's a mess . " In 2005 , the state began reforming Medicaid into a Statewide Medicaid Managed Care Program . There are two components : Long-Term Care was rolled out in Marion County in March ; Managed Medical Assistance is being rolled out locally today.Marion Senior Services operates the Marion Transit system , which provides low-cost rides to county residents who are " transportation disadvantaged . " But under the new Medicaid program , the state no longer will pay Marion Transit to provide transportation services to doctor appointments for Medicaid recipients.Instead , the state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Medicaid program , has contracted with four insurance companies to provide those services in Region 3 , which includes Marion County . Those companies are Prestige Health Choice , Staywell , Sunshine Health and UnitedHealthcare of Florida.Those companies will offer health insurance plans for Medicaid recipients , and the plans will include transportation.Stroh said Marion Transit discovered that many Medicaid recipients who were their clients were not aware their transportation was affected . As a result , people have had difficulty trying to make arrangements to get to doctor appointments . " It 's unorganized , " said Wendy Andzeski , who arranges transportation for residents at Camelot Chateau , an assisted living facility in Ocala.Camelot did not learn about the change until Sunday , when Marion Transit sent a fax stating it no longer could provide transportation to Medicaid recipients . " They 're senior citizens , " Andzeski said about her clients . " They ca n't drive themselves from here to the doctor . " Andzeski said when a caseworker from UnitedHealthcare of Florida came to Camelot on Monday to check on clients , Andzeski asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was talking about , " Andzeski said.Neither did a worker from Sunshine Health . " I call it miscommunication , " Andzeski said . " It 's frustrating . " Shalisha Coleman , AHCA press secretary , said AHCA sent letters notifying each Medicaid recipient that he or she needed to choose a medical plan from one of the four insurance companies , called managed care organizations ( MCOs ) . Transportation is provided under those medical plans . " We contracted with the health plans . The health plans would contract with the transportation providers , " Coleman said.She said if the person failed to choose a medical plan , AHCA would assign one to him or her . In those cases , AHCA sent the Medicaid recipient a letter stating which company would be his or her MCO.The problem is affecting doctors ' offices , as well . " We have had a few patients cancel their appointments because they do not have any transportation , " said Merrit Sinclair , practice administrator at the Marion Oaks Medical Clinic . " It 's affecting everybody significantly : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Sinclair said she called UnitedHealthcare to find out who would provide transportation and was told that Logisticare would be the contractor .

" Nobody knows what these companies are using . The patient does n't know . We do n't know . It 's a mess . " She was concerned , too , that some Medicaid recipients were placed in plans that were not affiliated with their doctors , so would not be able to see their doctors . <p> <p> Justin Senior , AHCA 's deputy secretary for Medicaid , estimated there would be about 3 million to 3.1 million Floridians in the statewide program.Regions 2 , 3 and 4 will be rolling out the Managed Medical Assistance program today .

" Anybody who wanted to know about it had numerous opportunities in a variety of different ways and venues to learn about the program , " Senior said.He said the agency mailed multiple items informing people about the changes and who to call and where to find information online .

" It 's extremely important that folks understand that , " Senior said.The four new companies should honor existing appointments and billing plans even if they are not under contract , Senior said . " We will make sure they are paid , " Senior said.If people did not choose a company and AHCA put them in a plan they do not like , or that does not include their doctors , they can change the plan within the first 90 days . After that , they will be able to switch plans during an open enrollment period.Both Stroh and Jennifer Mikula , administrator for Palm Gardens nursing home , said AHCA did a good job getting information out about the program . " The state has done a great job , " Mikula said.But Mikula said when AHCA rolled out the Long Term Care portion in March , her organization had problems when it requested transportation for a client .

They really are holding back information . Maybe they did n't have it . " She said she is not confident things will work well today , but hopes it will . " We are going to sit back tomorrow and hope for the best , " she said Wednesday.Stroh also was concerned about how 49 dialysis patients , who had been getting rides through her agency , would get to treatments .

She only learned Friday that she could get paid during the rollout . But no one could tell her how or when . " We could quickly run up quite a big receivable not knowing when we would be paid , " Stroh said.She said that as a non-profit , she does not have cash flow to absorb that .

" To ensure these standards are met , the Marion County Building Department developed permit application checklists for manufactured and site built sheds and accessory structures to help the public learn what information is needed for the permitting process , but are hampered by the fact that many do not even realize they need permits . " All structures require a permit and they 've always been required to have permits , " Bewley said . Anyone who wishes to place a structure that is larger than the average doghouse or a small well-top on their property should contact their local building department to ensure it meets the code . " I think that most of our violators are homeowners , " Hough said . " With prefab sheds especially , they think they can get it delivered and they 're good to go . " Bewley noted that many people buy metal carports and then arrive at his office without any paperwork , convinced his department would handle everything after the fact , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engineering drawings from the seller or contractor and a site plan defining the location before installation.As an added obstacle , while the side and rear areas of a property only require structures to maintain an 8-foot setback , the setback along the front of a property is significantly longer ; meaning carport owners frequently need to apply for a variance as well.Permits normally take about a week to process . An inspection of the finished structure to insure it is properly anchored can be performed the day after the building department is called , provided all the necessary information is included and legible . " I see a lot of rejections on permit applications because the people either did n't include their site plan , or their site plan does n't show the road names , " Hough said.Incomplete or mistake-filled applications can take longer to be approved , or may even be rejected , requiring the submission of a corrected copy at an additional fee . " It 's going to cost you less in the long run to try to get your permit issued beforehand , because if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fact , you 're either going to have to get rid of it or pay an engineer more money for after-the-fact plans and drawings , " said Hough .

And one , Republican Jackie Porter , does n't have a college degree at all and would n't be eligible to work as a school teacher in the massive district she would oversee.Most of the nation 's 16,000 school districts would n't face this choice because superintendents in the vast majority are hired by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Just 150 districts , including Marion , allow anyone to run for superintendent who is qualified to hold public office.But while some would argue that a college degree or even an advanced degree is necessary to run a school district , others say such requirements turn away people with valuable experience.Porter , for example , says her two decades of business experience offers fiscal responsibility to the financially strapped district.Porter , who was elected to the Marion County School Board in 2008 , is the former owner of Porter 's Home and Garden , a $13 million franchise that employed 250 people . She is now retired.The Marion County school district employs more than 5,000 people , more than half of whom are teachers . It is the county 's largest employer with an overall budget of about $500 million.Theresa Daem , the executive director of the National Association of School Superintendents , was surprised that Florida does not have degree requirements for its superintendents of schools .

" I do know people in our world who are brilliant , even though they are self-educated , " Daem said.Still , if Porter is elected , she would become the only superintendent of schools in Florida without a college degree.Of the 67 districts in Florida , 25 superintendents have earned doctorate degrees .

" It 's the team that builds a school district , " she said.In a prepared statement , Porter said she intends to build stellar academic and business teams to take a fresh look at Marion 's education system.Porter said she plans to use these newly formed teams " to turn the ship around and head upstream . " " Are you ready for someone to focus on the problems with a new set of eyes that is unbiased and is not influenced by the system ?

The three will face off in the August primary , with the winner advancing to the November general election against Democrat Diana Greene , 48 , deputy superintendent of curriculum and instruction.They are vying to replace Jim Yancey , who is retiring .

Just four years ago , this land was covered in a citrus grove . But on this sunny mid-morning , not one orange tree remains . <p> " I just got tired of dealing with the freezing and the greening and the canker , " he said , plucking a small peach from a tree . <p> Like many Florida citrus farmers , the uncertainty caused by the citrus diseases and previous freezes caused him to turn to peach farming which has become a viable alternative thanks to much research and refinement by University of Florida experts . <p> " We had a cold snap for one or two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " the owner of SunSweet Peaches said . " We did n't want to plant it again . It was still too risky . " <p> He estimated that his citrus losses from the freeze could add up to nearly $200,000 . <p> Jacqueline Burns , director of UF 's Citrus Research and Education Center in Lake Alfred , said citrus greening and canker have plagued commercial citrus growers all over the state and made growing the fruit too expensive for some . <p> The Asian citrus psyllid was first detected in Florida in 1998 , according to the Florida Department of Agriculture . The citrus greening disease then showed up in Miami-Dade County in 2005 and later in other areas of the state . <p> " The cost of managing citrus has increased because of the extra precaution taken to grow the crop , " Burns said . <p> Some citrus growers , she said , are buying new land to start growing peaches or are turning some of their groves into peach orchards . <p> " There 's disease pressure , but there 's also business pressure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If I ca n't productively and sustainably grow citrus , what else can I do ?

" <p> With the UF now producing peach varieties that can grow in Florida 's sub-tropical climate , peaches have become an alternative for citrus farmers who want to diversify and spread their risk . <p> " I think they 're seeing the writing on the wall that they ca n't have all their eggs in one basket , " said Mercy Olmstead , an extension specialist for stone fruit production with UF 's Department of Horticultural Sciences in Gainesville . <p> The school has come up with " low-chill " varieties of peaches that do n't require as many cold days to produce fruit like northern trees do and can survive Florida 's mostly subtropical climate . <p> Although growing peaches is usually associated with Georgia and South Carolina , peach farming is not entirely new to Florida . <p> According to Olmstead , Florida had about 5,000 planted acres of peach trees in the early 1980s , but a devastating freeze in the mid-80s caused a drastic drop to about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Florida peach farming only started to pick up again about a decade ago , she said .

A peach tree takes about a year to produce its first fruit and up to three years to be in full production . <p> Although the U.S. Department of Agriculture still does n't track Florida 's peach production , Olmstead said the industry will keep growing and expects at least a 15 percent increase in production this year from 2011 . <p> Sterling Ivey , a spokeswoman for Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services , said the best definitive information on Florida peach production will come out in a USDA Census report that will be released in February 2014 . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ production continues to expand , " Ivey said . " We estimate in the next three years we 'll see a massive increase in production acres , which currently remains far less of the number of acres dedicated to citrus . <p> This will be Harper 's second harvest . He planted his first 10 acres of peach trees in spring 2010 and sold most of his first fruit through a " you-pick " last year , charging the public about $1.50 per pound picked . <p> Over the last two years , SunSweet Peaches planted 15 more acres and plans to have a total of 40 acres planted . Harper expects to harvest 40,000 pounds of peaches , up from 15,000 pounds last year , and is in talks with a few grocery stores to start selling his fruit commercially . <p> The advantage with growing peaches in Florida , he said , is that the peaches hit the market two months before Georgia and California and can enjoy a market with little competition .

Thomas Jefferson , a man of many talents , took great delight in the gardens that surrounded his home in Virginia . He viewed the landscape as an ongoing project , one that was never really completed , but rather a work in progress.This year , should you deliberate this opportunity , consider planting a camellia in your landscape.Originally from the Orient , camellias were introduced to Charleston , S.C. , shortly after the American Revolutionary War . A versatile plant , camellias perform well in Florida 's climate and serve many landscape functions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ background groupings and hedges . A fall and winter bloomer , camellias give color to the landscape at a time when many plants are entering dormancy . During the spring and summer , when many plants are blooming , the evergreen camellia provides an excellent dark-green backdrop for the warm-season landscape . A slow grower , these plants require infrequent pruning . Further , camellias come in a variety of colors , from pure white to brilliant crimson . Flowers may be single or double and come in various sizes and forms . Camellias perform best in filtered sunlight , and prefer good air movement . Soils should be well-drained , with a pH slightly on the acidic side , about 5.0 . If a soil test indicates the pH is high , use a sulfur-coated fertilizer to lower pH . Apply +-pound of 15-0-15 fertilizer per 100 square feet of planting area four times during the year before spring growth occurs , after the first growth flush , in mid-summer and in early winter . If your pH is higher than 5.0 , you may experience chlorotic growth because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , manganese and zinc . Use of the advised sulfur-coated fertilizer , in the proper amount , will correct this problem . As you consider locations where camellias will perform best , locate plants where cold air can move in and out freely , but that are protected from cold winds . Filtered sunlight , i.e. under pines , makes a good location because the plants have the opportunity following cold nights to gradually warm in the morning sun . Dense shade may result in sparse foliage and poor flowering , while direct sun is likely to result in yellow-green foliage . There are two varieties Professor Sargent ( red ) and Walter Bellingrath ( light to rose pink ) that perform well in full-sun locations.Transplant camellias between November and February so roots can become established before the summer heat sets in . If transplanting in late spring , extra care will be needed to get plants established . Set the plant in a hole that is two times as wide as the container and slightly shallower ( about 1 to 2 inches ) above the existing soil line to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roots will grow outward , away from the plant . While planting , periodically insert a garden hose , adjusted to a medium flow , into the hole as you backfill to eliminate excess air pockets . Create a soil berm , about 8 inches high and two feet out from the center of the plant . Using a garden hose , fill the bowl to the berm each day with water for the first two weeks , then every other day for the next three weeks . Following this , water twice weekly until the summer rains begin . During the first year , apply supplemental water during dry periods , depending on temperature and time of year . Although not a Florida native , camellias perform well if located properly . Their brilliant colors during the dark days of winter are a welcome addition to dormant season landscapes.David Holmes is Marion County extension director . Contact him at **31;2474;TOOLONG

Is it too late to plant some in my garden ? Should I just use the ones from the grocery store ? A : Americans eat more than 100 pounds of potatoes a year , so you might as well grow some of those yourself . Most people think of Idaho when they think about growing potatoes , but Florida has long been a potato-growing state . We generally grow the new red and white new potatoes .

Get your seed potatoes from a local feed and seed store or from a local nursery . Cut the seed potato in pieces making sure that every piece has at least one eye ' . The eye will be the growth point of the potato plant . For best results let the seed pieces heal over before planting . Do this by letting the pieces sit for one to two days at room temperature . Potatoes like to grow in loose soil , so when preparing the soil dig deeply and turn the area over at least one foot down . Plants should be spaced at about 6-8 inches within the row , with at least 36 inches between rows . Seed pieces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Seed pieces should be planted with the cut side down and eyes ( or sprouts ) facing up.During the growing season you will have some potato farming chores to do . You will need to periodically hill the potatoes . Hilling is the act of adding soil to the top of the potato row . We do this to prevent potato tubers from pushing through the soil surface . Exposed tubers are green and inedible . Add 2 to 3 inches of soil after sprouts come up , and repeat the hilling as the plant grows . Keep your potatoes healthy by fertilizing with a 10-0-10 fertilizer after four weeks of growth . You also will need to irrigate the spud plants one to two times a week . The garden soil should stay moist but never soggy in the potato patch . In about 80 to 100 days the potatoes will be ready to harvest .

Its attached at the opening of the vagina and is very painful . What can I take that is natural to help shrink it ? C.A. , OrlandoA : Fibroids are non-cancerous growths that more often appear in the breast , uterus or ovaries . One thing is clear about fibroids , they need estrogen to grow and if you reduce the amount of estrogen in the body , they retreat . This is why menopausal women seem to trade in their fibroids for hot flashes.Some fibroids grow to the size of a grapefruit . Hysterectomies are sometimes performed as treatment. Its understandable in certain serious cases when the fibroids cause extreme pain or cancer is involved , but I think its barbaric that doctors used to do routine hysterectomies to remove fibroids @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't  fix the hormonal imbalance that caused it in the first place.Hysterectomies rank up there with other ridiculous procedures that were once popular , like bloodletting , routine tonsillectomies and lobotomies ! So ladies , before you get talked into going under the knife , at least try some of the following supplements.Serrapeptase : This is an enzyme that eats cysts for food . I think it is amazing for inflammatory conditions and it should shrink your fibroids with continued use . Sold widely online and in health food stores.Myomin : A blend of Chinese herbs was developed by an Oriental naturopath , Dr. Chi . The supplement limits estrogen production , acting sort of like an " aromatase inhibitor " similarly to stronger prescription drugs ( Aromasin , Evista and Tamoxifen ) . Sold online at **26;2567;TOOLONG or www.chi-health.com.This supplement will you reduce estrogen load and when fibroids do n't  get the estrogen they need , bloating might occur , especially right before your period and for a few days into your cycle . So it appears that your fibroid condition is worsening . Bloating should subside midway through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few months as the fibroids slowly dissolve and exit the body . I3C or DIM : This supplement is extracted from broccoli , cauliflower and other cruciferous veggies . It helps reduce estrogen in the body so the same warnings exist for this supplement as for Myomin.Evening Primrose Oil : Its extracted from the seeds of a wildflower and provides you with gamma-linolenic acid ( GLA ) . This can help relieve painful menstrual cycles , endometriosis and fibroid tumors too ! Diet : No more fried food , dairy or meat because these may fuel the growth of fibroids . Eat more salads and fruits . Drink juices that are red and fresh , like pure pomegranate , grape or cranberry juice . Medicine : Wean off your birth control or hormone replacement drugs ( with your doctors blessings ) because these forms of estrogen fuel fibroid growth . Did you know ?

Unfortunately , no , I responded . Their season is only beginning , and will run through the end of May . Attracted to light colors , adult lovebugs congregate around doors and windows of houses where they become a nuisance , entering the home any time the door is open , or finding their way in , seemingly through the smallest of cracks . They also are attracted to the warmth of roadways , where they hover above the road surface and become splattered over automobile grills , hoods and windshields . If left on the auto for several days , lovebug @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a University of Florida employee , I have occasionally been asked about the university 's responsibility for introducing lovebugs into Florida , purportedly in a failed experiment to introduce a control for mosquito larva . This is an odd myth , and probably has been confused with the introduction of the gypsy moth into northeastern forests in 1869 , when some of the larva escaped from a lab in Bedford , Massachusetts . In reality , lovebugs migrated from Central America , through Texas and Louisiana , first arriving in the Florida Panhandle in 1949 . By the 1970s , lovebug populations had reached Central Florida , and expanded as far north as South Carolina . Lovebugs appear during two distinct seasons in Central Florida April through May , and August through September . Lovebug larvae feed on decaying plant matter , and as adults , pose no problem to healthy plants where they feed on the blooming plants ' nectar . Although it seems longer , adult lovebugs live only three to four days , just long enough to mate , feed , disperse and lay a batch of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as the insects often are spotted as mated pairs , with the smaller male clinging to the female . Mating takes several hours , and pairs may remain coupled a few days before the female makes a dispersal flight , looking for a suitable habitat to deposit her eggs . Do lovebugs have any significant natural enemies ? A few species of hunting spiders have been known to feed on lovebugs , and dragonflies and birds also contribute slightly to their demise . But , unfortunately , they do n't put much of a dent on the population . The predatory fire ants have not been known to feed on lovebugs , so they seemingly have little in the way of natural predators . They must be the broccoli of the insect dietary world . Occasionally , people have wondered whether insecticides might provide relief from lovebugs . Insecticides available to the public for controlling houseflies , mosquitoes and other files also will kill lovebug adults . However , there are risks associated with using these materials around humans and pets , and after a short time , lovebugs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been done . Insecticides are expensive , potentially harmful to people and pets , and provide no significant relief from these pests , so using them is not recommended . Because of the potential damage a coating of these insects has on automobile finishes , there are some recommendations to protect the paint on your car . First , just prior to the start of lovebug season , apply a fresh coat of wax , which will aid in removal . Try to remove them within 24 hours , before insects have a chance to " bake " onto the painted surface . Allow the water to run for a few minutes to soak the drying insects before applying " elbow grease . " Some literature suggests a light coating of baby oil to grills and bumpers at the onset of the season , to aid in the ease of removal .

While they are unquestionably a nuisance to motorists and unwelcome around doors , decks and porches , they are not a significant problem that will receive research funding ; these monies must be directed to more pressing issues that impact the people and the economy of Florida . For the foreseeable future , it appears we will have to live with them for short periods a couple times a year .

The discomfort resulted in many visits to the emergency room , referrals to various specialists , wrong diagnoses and a daily cocktail of painkillers.Her once-sunny disposition turned morose , and her vigorous workouts declined to a measly 20 minutes of walking a day . When one doctor 's tests revealed no explanation , Sweet said , he told her she had " chronic pelvic pain and I should learn to live with it .

Towfigh repaired them both in a four-hour laparoscopic operation . " I was back exercising in a week and jogging 10 days later , " Sweet said in an interview .

She recalled that Sweet said she had experienced " burning , pinching pain shot down into her groin , leg and back . It was worse with exercise , prolonged standing , lifting , bending , coughing , laughing , going up and down stairs , straining at stool , and during her menstrual period .

" That may require positioning the patient to provoke the symptoms.Metzger said that an abdominal exam in the standing position sometimes reveals a subtle bulge .

Michael Shane Bargo Jr . is over.The verdict has been rendered , the defendant has been transported to death row and the remains of 15-year-old Seath Jackson were delivered to his family for proper burial . <p> By April WarrenStaff writer <p> The State of Florida vs . Michael Shane Bargo Jr . is over.The verdict has been rendered , the defendant has been transported to death row and the remains of 15-year-old Seath Jackson were delivered to his family for proper burial.But what happens to the tangible evidence that helped the state prove a group of young people lured the boy to a Summerfield home in 2011 , where they shot and beat him before burning his body in a backyard fire pit ? The evidence will now join countless other items of evidence from both civil and criminal cases that are tried typically 51 weeks a year inside the Marion County Judicial Center . " Evidence that has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our evidence division and from there it is basically logged into our evidence tracking system , " said Staci Winston , criminal courts manager for Marion County.This is generally how the process works , however if law enforcement brings evidence to court and testifies about that evidence , they typically bring that evidence back to their headquarters.Of all the evidence submitted and kept with the clerk 's office from one trial , the material is not necessarily kept together . " We do have separate locations for certain types of things , " Winston said . " We have a drug cabinet where it 's just drugs that are kept and we have several cabinets that contain just firearms or weapons . " There also is a large locked refrigerator and a freezer available in the vaults for DNA evidence and certain sexual assault kits.Typically , evidence from cases that are not pending appeal will be destroyed three years after the date of disposition . But evidence from all capital cases are kept either until the defendant dies on death row or at the end of their life span in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years after the defendant 's death , according to evidence coordinator Debra Deen.Even evidence in cases where a not guilty verdict is rendered will be kept for a period of time.Many of these rules are spelled out either in state statue or in the state 's rules of judicial administration.According to Assistant State Attorney Bill Gladson , it is important to preserve evidence in case a defendant 's guilty verdict is overturned on appeal , either by challenging the legality of the conviction or proving the defense counsel to be ineffective.This scenario proved true in the case of William Kopsho , now 60 , who is currently on death row for killing his wife Lynne on State Road 40 in 2000 . Circuit Judge David Eddy sentenced Kopshow to death in 2005 , only to re-sentence him in 2009 after the defendant received a new trial that resulted from an appeal . Any evidence submitted during the trial is still residing inside the Marion County Judicial Center.The vaults no longer hold evidence , however , from Aileen Wuornos , a drifter and prostitute who admitted to killing seven men in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her arrest in 1991 . Wuornos died in 2002 after a 10-year stay on death row.Also purged from the vault by now is any evidence submitted from a robbery case involving Gainesville student serial killer Danny Rolling , who died in 2006 after almost 13 years on death row.There are two vaults and two permanent secured rooms for evidence inside the Marion County Judicial Center , plus two additional rooms to house evidence temporarily , such as during a trial that might last several days . Most of the space is used for criminal evidence , however one vault and part of one room contain civil evidence , according to Deen.Each location is so secure there are only two people in the courthouse that have access to the rooms Winston and Deen . The list does n't include the Clerk of the Circuit Court David Ellspermann . Not even law enforcement is allowed into the vaults.When asked the reason for such tight security and the vagueness for the exact location of the vaults , Winston says it is her job to keep the evidence secure and she could even be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We maintain the chain of custody and we have to ensure it 's been kept in a secured location , " she said.As more trials conclude and more evidence enters the vault , the question arises ; could the court run out of room ? " I guess there 's always that possibility , but we 've really tried in the last year and a half to focus on items that can be destroyed , " Winston said.The evidence coordinator position was created in October 2012 . As part of her job , Deen takes in all evidence , labels the items , pulls items needed for appeals and works on preparing notices and checking individual cases for destruction.Once the three-year mark hits , Winston says the destruction process begins and the court will reach out to the attorneys involved , giving them 90 days to ask for any of the items to be returned . Sometimes the State Attorney 's Office will ask for evidence to be returned to victims , such as jewelry or other personal affects . Certain items can also be released per a court order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or firearms are returned to law enforcement for disposal . Drugs are burned by incineration , in conjunction with the Marion County Sheriff 's Office . Certain documents will be shredded if other disposal arrangements have not been made.At one point , a plethora of firearms were in evidence from either probate or estate cases , which made it hard for the clerk 's office to determine ownership . " Those have kind of been our challenge , " Winston said.In the capital case of Bargo and his co-defendants , the evidence must remain in the vault until three years after the last defendant dies . Since Bargo , 21 , has been sentenced to death , but four other young co-defendants have all been sentenced to life in prison Amber Wright , 17 ; Kyle Hooper , 19 ; Charlie Kay Ely , 21 ; and Justin Soto , 22 the evidence inside the Marion County Judicial Center 's evidence rooms could end up outliving Bargo by several decades.Contact April Warren at 867-4065 or april.warren@ocala.com.

He called this the most cold , calculated and premeditated case of murder he has seen in his 32 years as a member of the Florida Bar . <p> In August a 12-member jury recommended death by a vote of 10-2 and the judge legally must give their decision great weight , but ultimately has the final word . <p> Fridays death sentence solidifies the 21-year-olds new place as the youngest of 404 inmates currently on Floridas death row . <p> The verdict also wraps up the most grisly murder case Marion County has seen in recent years . It claimed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people Amber Wright , 17 ; Kyle Hooper , 19 ; Charlie Kay Ely , 21 ; and Justin Soto , 22 to prison for the rest of their lives , leaving many families , including the victims , permanently torn apart . <p> The state sought the death penalty for Bargo , the triggerman and mastermind behind the horrific murder plot . <p> On April 17 , 2011 , five teenagers lured Seath , 15 , to a Summerfield residence where they beat , shot and tortured him , before burning his body in a backyard fire pit . The group then placed the remains in three five-gallon paint buckets and dumped them at the bottom of a limerock pit . <p> During the trial the state presented evidence that a feud between Bargo and Seath erupted over Wright , while the defense contended that a lack of parental supervision caused neighborhood bullying to continue unaddressed . <p> Bargo remained composed during the hearing , but one of his family members broke out in sobs upon hearing the judges decision . Seaths family , who has had to endure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attend the highly publicized hearing . <p> While bailiffs led Bargo out of the courtroom in handcuffs , Michael Bargo Sr. called out " I love you , son . " <p> The judges decision also continues a startling trend : Of the now eight individuals from Marion County currently on death row , seven were sentenced in their 20s and more than half , including Bargo , were in the 21-23 age range . The average age for executed inmates at the time of offense is about 30 , according to the Department of Corrections , making Marion Countys convicted murderers younger than the average death row inmate . <p> " I think that is a scary trend , " said defense attorney Candace Hawthorne , who represented Bargo and two other defendants in their 20s currently on death row . <p> Hawthorne pointed to evidence presented during Bargos trial regarding adolescent brain development . While society uses 18 as the cutoff age for adulthood , she calls the number arbitrary and says science proves the brain is not fully developed until age 25 . <p> Evidence presented during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ level than a fully developed brain , and therefore younger individuals are susceptible to higher emotional levels and have less ability to control impulses and handle stressors . <p> However , at trial no expert testimony supported the notion that Bargo couldnt help but kill Seath . <p> " Its a Machiavellian tragedy , " said Hawthorne of the case . " The system failed and the parents failed . " <p> Bargo will now be allowed to start the appeals process first to the Florida Supreme Court where Hawthorne believes he might find some relief . <p> During the trials penalty phase , Assistant State Attorneys Robin Arnold and Amy Berndt argued the crime was especially cold , calculated and premeditated as well as heinous , atrocious and cruel . <p> Hawthorne said all murders are heinous , atrocious and cruel , and this case had no more premeditation than other murder cases . <p> In his 21-page sentencing order , Eddy agreed with the state . He pointed to testimony that Bargo planned the murder , directed his co-defendants actions , and ordered the victim to be placed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him in the face , ultimately causing his death . <p> " The actions of the defendant were conscienceless and exemplified an extreme desire to inflict a high degree of pain , fear and terror in the victim , " Eddy wrote . <p> He also gave great weight to the second aggravating factor . Eddy referenced Bargos careful planning of when to light the backyard fire where Seaths body would eventually be burned . His actions were not only calm and careful but exhibited a degree of deliberate ruthlessness and failure to provide a legal defense for the murder , the judge found . <p> " I 'm not crazy , I 'm not a psycho , I 'm not a bad person , " Bargo told the Ocala Star-Banner during a recent jailhouse interview . He described himself as non-confrontational and unaggressive and still maintains his innocence in the ordeal , calling co-defendant Hooper the real shooter . <p> " I am not surprised by the judges decision , " Hawthorne said after the hearing Friday . " I think he ( Eddy ) has a lot of pressure locally to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the three statutory mitigating circumstances offered by the defense Bargo was under extreme mental or emotional disturbance at the time of the crime , his inability to appreciate the criminality of his conduct and lastly , his age Eddy was only reasonably convinced by two and awarded them slight weight , discounting Bargos inability to appreciate the criminality of the conduct . <p> Eddy found evidence Bargo suffers from a biological mental illness , schizoaffective disorder , and might have a partial complex seizure spectrum disorder . But that did not rise to the level of legal justification . <p> According to Eddy , despite conflicting diagnosis results from both state and defense experts , all agreed Bargos ability to appreciate the criminality of his conduct or to conform his conduct to the law was not impaired . <p> In addition to providing the judge with the statutory mitigators , the defense also submitted 55 non-statutory mitigators . <p> The judge gave six of them moderate weight , including the role of his co-defendants , and diagnoses of bipolar and schizoaffective disorder . <p> Eddy awarded slight weight to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his father , and evidence he has had hallucinations and paranoid delusional thinking . <p> Thirty-one of those non-statutory mitigating factors were given little weight .

Should I use sod or plugs to patch the holes ? <p> By Wendy WilberColumnist <p> Q : I have some bare spots in my Zoysia grass . Should I use sod or plugs to patch the holes ? A : Dead areas caused by damage or lack of water can be patched using sod or plugs . If it is a small area , I prefer the plugs because they have a well-developed root system and will take off quickly . Plant them about 12-16 inches apart for quick grow-in . Sod would be better if you have a larger area to cover . Sod pieces have had their roots cut away , so you will need to make sure they stay moist . The summer rains should help , but if the weather dries up , you will need to water the sod pieces every day for at least two weeks . Thrifty gardeners make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from a healthy area of the lawn and transplanting them to areas that are bare . These homemade plugs need to be watered regularly until they take off in a couple of weeks .

Q : The weeds and stinkbugs are winning , and I am ready to give up my vegetable garden for the summer . What should I do to my raised beds now ? A : This is the step that many gardeners forget to do . If you are n't growing great summer crops like okra , sweet potatoes , and Seminole pumpkin , it is a good idea to put the garden to bed for a couple of months while you start your plans for the fall garden . The first thing to do is to remove everything from the bed . Even though it looks like you might have one or two tomatoes or peppers trying to finish , pull them out.The longer they stay in , the more insect and disease problems they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or leaf footed plant bug problems , you need to get rid of their hiding places . Also , take out all the weeds . If the weeds stay in , then they make seeds that will be next season 's weed problem . Once everything is out , cover the soil with a layer of cardboard or newspaper , and put a 3-inch layer of leaves or mulch on top of the paper . This will effectively block the sun from reaching any weeds or weed seeds that were missed . When you are ready to plant in September , remove the mulch and the paper , work in some compost or aged manure into the soil , and you are ready to put in seeds or transplants . Some gardeners choose to solarize their garden soil in the summer . Solarizing uses the heat from the sun to kill weed seeds and deter fungal and pest problems . To solarize your garden soil , remove all plants and weeds and moisten the soil . Cover the area with 3 mm or thicker of clear plastic . Weigh the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cover . In the summer , temperatures under the plastic will rise to at least 120 degrees . It needs to get this hot to kill off the pests and weeds . Leave the plastic in place for at least six weeks .

HAZEN , M.D.MASTER GARDENER <p> A Florida native almost wiped out by the Florida arrowroot flour industry in early the 1900 's , the Zamia floridana ( Coontie ) is making a come back . Rare in the wild , it remains on the Florida Commercially Exploited Plant list making it illegal to collect wild specimens . The Coontie is a cycad , a woody plant usually confused with palms and ferns , yet related to neither . Another well known cycad ( that you are most likely familiar with ) is the non-native Sago palm . Cycads , tree ferns and palms all have a central trunk topped by a whorl of leaves , usually without any side branches . Fern have spores . Palms have true flowers that become seed fruit . But , cycads are Gymnosperm , and , cycads , Gingko , pines , Cyprus , and cedars have cones . Technically a woody plant , the cycad trunk actually is a thick , soft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true wood tissue . For years cycads were seen only in exotic botanical gardens like Fairchild Gardens ( Miami ) and Kanapaha Botanical Gardens ( Gainesville ) . Occasional Coonties were found around old cracker homes . Today , thanks to cycad enthusiasts , state park programs and native plant growers the coontie is landscaped into parks and gardens throughout Florida . Cycads are like no other plant group alive today . Among the most ancient of all plants , they are often called living fossils . The Zamia floridana 's primitive tropical shaped silhouette with rich deep green glossy stiff fern-like leaves provides an excellent landscape plant for specimen display , border , foundation , transition , background , container display or bonsai . Hardy and adaptable , it grows in a wide range of soil tolerating drought , sun , shade , and moderate frost . Cut coontie leaves stand out as greenery in floral arrangements . Coonties have few pests , such as the Red Florida Scale and mealy bug . Pests are rare if plants are not over watered and provided ample space for good air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of horticultural oil and Malathion . Recurrent infections require adding a systemic pesticide ( Orthene or Merit ) . In older plants , consider cutting out some weaker leaves to increase air circulation . Prevent the problem by adequate spacing of new plants . Plant the larger Northeast coontie at four- to five-foot intervals and the smaller West Coast and South Florida coontie at two- to three-foot intervals . By the time they are five or six , the space will be filled . A new crisis is the cycad aulacaspis scale . It came from Thailand and was first found in 1996 in the upscale landscape homes along Cutler road in Miami . It has now spread across the United States . This pest covers a plant in days to weeks with a white snow flake scale . The infestation is so strong it can kill the plant .

If they found pests , they sprayed the plants thoroughly with mineral oil or DDT . Today we have horticultural oil and safer chemicals like Merit and Malathion . This cultural practice can reduce pest problems for these tough plants . Unlike other cycads , Coonties suffer few mineral deficiencies . This is easily avoided by applying a palm fertilizer twice a year ( spring and fall ) . Coonties are expensive because they are slow growing . It takes five years to reach commercial size . The coontie flushes and produces new leaves only once the first year , and there are only two to four short leaves . If you break one off , you must wait another year for replacement . Each year coonties will produce more leaves and they are longer . At the fourth or fifth year , the beauty begins . Flushing many leaves once or twice each year . You can grow your own from seed . And , once the seedling hardens you can plant them in the ground @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much faster and produce longer leaves when in the ground . Some commercial growers have figured this out .

@@97887249 @2087249/ <h> Stroke experts agree : The faster you get treatment , the better <p> That 's what Tiffany Perez was thinking on April 26 . She was resting in her mothers home at the time , having left her job as a teachers aide after feeling weak and dizzy during lunch . <p> At her mothers house , things got worse . Perezs left arm and leg became numb . Her boyfriend drove her to the emergency room . During the ride , one side of her face went numb . <p> Perez was right . She was having a stroke . But she got to the hospital fast , and that made all the difference . Doctors injected tPA into her IV . The clot dissolving tPA ( short for tissue plasminogen activator ) worked wonders . <p> " After about 15 minutes my numbness started going away , " Perez said . <p> In one respect , Perezs case was unusual . She is only 20 years old . Most stroke patients are much older . <p> In another respect , her case was representative : The sooner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The goal is to get rid of the blood clot as quickly as possible to reduce damage . <p> " We have to get blood flow returned , " said Dr. Anna Khanna , an assistant professor in the vascular neurology division of the University of Florida College of Medicine and a part of the UF Health Shands Comprehensive Stroke Center . <p> There is no good place to have a stroke . But some areas are better equipped than others to help patients . This part of Florida is recognized as one of the best . <p> In Ocala , Munroe Regional Medical Center and Ocala Regional Medical Center ( where Perez was treated on April 26 ) are accredited by the Joint Commission as primary stroke centers . In Gainesville , North Florida Regional Medical Center has that same designation but said it 's on track to achieve the higher status of comprehensive stroke center . It already has achieved comprehensive status from the state Agency for Health Care Administration . UF Health Shands is a Joint Commission-certified comprehensive stroke center , one of only six in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in detecting and treating the clots that cause strokes , finding links between human behavior and strokes , and developing treatments to minimize the damage once strokes occur . That work is on full display in this part of Florida . <p> Until about a decade ago , strokes were the third leading cause of death . New medical devices designed to remove clots , development of drugs to break up clots to allow brain cells to receive needed blood and oxygen , and the onset of a national education campaign to teach people about stroke symptoms have combined to yield better results . <p> In 1996 , the age-adjusted stroke death rate in Alachua County was nearly 67 fatalities per 100,000 people . By 2015 , that had dropped to under 39 . In Marion County , the age-adjusted death rate from stroke in 1996 was 84.3 . By 2015 it had fallen to 30.4 . <p> " Today we should be very happy , " said Dr. Edgardo Cruz-Martinez , Ocala Healths neurology medical director . Ocala Health owns Ocala Regional and West Marion Community Hospital ; its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> <p> Each year , nearly 800,000 people in the United States have a stroke . It is the fifth leading cause of death . About 2 women out of every 10 between the ages of 55 and 75 will suffer a stroke ; for men , it 's a little less . <p> The risk of stroke doubles each decade after age 55 . Most of the people who have a stroke are at least 65 , but a quarter of stroke victims ( like Perez ) are younger . <p> Improvement in care has hit a series of high notes since 1996 , when the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved the clot-dissolving plasminogen activator ( tPA ) that helped Perez . It is used in cases of ischemic strokes . <p> Ischemic strokes , which account for about 87 percent of strokes , occur when a blood vessel that takes blood to the brain gets blocked . Sometimes the clot travels from another part of the body to the brain and causes a blood clot . Sometimes the clot originates in the brain . <p> Before tPA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back much of their function , Cruz-Martinez said . Two out of 3 get their function back if tPA is used with 4+ hours of a stroke . <p> There have been significant mechanical improvements in removing clots that tPA may not be able to reach . A thrombectomy is a procedure in which a doctor uses a wire device to remove a blood clot . The doctor typically threads a catheter to the blocked artery in the brain . The wires basket opens and grabs the clot ; the wire and clot are then removed . In some cases , a small tube is transported with the wire and tPA is directly administered to the clot . <p> " Forty years ago , when you had a stroke , most of the people went to the hospital and you stayed there a long period of time , " Cruz-Martinez said . " There was a concept of rehabilitation , but it was n't very rehabilitative . " <p> By the 1980s there had been advancements in cardiovascular health that included drugs like clopidogrel , also known as Plavix , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as Coumadin to help prevent heart attacks . Though designed to stave off heart problems , the drugs helped potential stroke victims , too . <p> While these drugs help with ischemic strokes , they wont work on hemorrhagic strokes . That kind of stroke occurs when a blood vessel in the brain bursts and bleeds , which damages brain tissue . They account for only about 10 percent of strokes but are typically more serious . The treatment focuses on controlling the bleeding and reducing the pressure caused by the excess blood . Doctors can us some drugs to reduce blood pressure or to slow the bleeding . <p> People can avoid some of the causes of strokes , such as high cholesterol , high blood pressure , sedentary lifestyle , drinking alcohol and eating too much , Martinez said . Smokers have double the chance of having an ischemic stroke . <p> A recent study showed that nearly 20 percent of participants strokes were due to pre-high blood pressure , indicating that even mildly high blood pressure increases the chance of a stroke . Those in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stroke than those with normal blood pressure . <p> High cholesterol levels increase the chances of hemorrhagic stroke . Cholesterol levels between 200 and 240 increase the risk by at least 20 percent , one study showed . <p> " The biggest tool we have is prevention , " Cruz-Martinez said . " You do n't  need to do tests ( looking for clots ) to tell someone to stop smoking , to exercise , and not eat at McDonald 's . " <p> <p> For stroke sufferers , time is brain cells . The sooner the stroke patient gets to a hospital , the better . tPA must be used within 4.5 hours of a stroke . Fast arrival at a hospital also gives specialists time to perform other procedures . <p> tPA has its limits . It takes time to work and isnt as effective with larger clots . In addition , tPA also risks bleeding in the brain . <p> The wire devices that doctors use have improved , from corkscrew designs 10 years ago to those with grasping abilities . The size also has decreased ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inside smaller blood vessels that previously were out of reach . <p> As for the future : UF 's Khanna said researchers will keep improving the clot-removing devices . The future also might include electrical currents or ultra-waves to dissolve clots in places that tiny wires cant reach . There probably wont be better drugs to replace tPA any time soon ; however , there is a need for drugs that can help reduce swelling and inflammation following a stroke . <p> As good as stroke treatment is today , Khanna said , people should recognize the reality . Only about half the people who come to the hospital will be treated with drugs or a clot removal procedure . The other half will have arrived at the hospital too late , or already be taking blood thinning medicine , or be experiencing bleeding or have other brain problem issues . <p> Dr. Asif Khan , director of vascular and interventional neurology at North Florida Regional Medical Center , said that once people have a stroke , they start changing their lifestyle to prevent a second one . Nearly a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first stroke is " a great motivation time , " Khan said . " I would say that the majority of my patients are successful in some kind of lifestyle change . " <p> But too many people are still having strokes that could have been avoided . Khan said more effort and incentives are needed to persuade people to live healthier lifestyles . One incentive might be for health insurance companies to offer its enrollees gym memberships . More information about strokes and prevention should be taught in schools . Children should be encouraged to be more active . <p> Given that about 800,000 people in the United States have strokes every year , reducing the number by 10 percent " would be a huge step in the right direction , " Khan said . <p> While the medical community has made great strides in treating strokes , more should be done to detect blockages early , Khan said . At-risk patients should routinely be screened for potential problems in carotid arteries and other areas . People should be checked for micro strokes . <p> Likewise , society @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as facial weakness and slurred speech , so they know to get help more quickly , he said . Despite public education on the issue , Khan said he is still surprised that many people do n't  come to hospitals when symptoms arise . <p> Unlike having a heart attack " that hurts " and gets people to go to a doctor , " strokes do n't  hurt , " he said . <p> Perez , the young stroke victim from Ocala , said her family had no more history of strokes than most . At her age , she never feared stroke . <p> " I knew I was n't in the best shape , but that ( a stroke ) was n't something that would happen to me , " said Perez , a teaching assistant at Evergreen Elementary School . <p> On April 26 , Perez was watching her students at lunch and began to feel lightheaded . " Then my right leg started to throb . I thought it was a muscle spasm , " she said . <p> Twenty minutes later she was dizzy and weak . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fuzzy , but she remembers getting short of breath and calling her boyfriend to tell him how she was feeling . <p> She thought the machine was broken or maybe she was having anxiety . " I was having a stroke at that timeand did n't  know it , " she said . <p> Perez left school and drove to her mothers home to rest . She called her mother at work . While she was waiting , he left leg and arm went numb . <p> " I could barely move it ( my arm ) , " she recalled . <p> Like the medical community , Perez encourages people not to wait to get help when they have stroke-like symptoms . She also encourages people not to think it could n't happen to them just because their age or general health do n't fit the profile of the average stroke sufferer . <p> " It can happen to anybody , " she said . <p> <p> One day last week , Hampton Rogers was resting in his bed at Ocala Regional Medical Center and working with speech pathologist Heather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swallow because it all does n't  go down when I swallow , " Rogers told her . <p> Case held the tip of Rogers tongue with a dry cloth as he swallowed .

Parts of the parietal lobe are important for processing language . <p> Rogers owns a vehicle detailing business . Like many people who have had strokes , he has suffered some short-term memory loss . He does n't  remember Case from intensive care and does not recall many of his previous sessions with her . <p> He thinks he s been in the hospital since November .

Customized help and treatment is key . <p> The patient has the best chance of producing blood flow to damaged areas of the brain , and its peripheral areas , during the first six weeks after the stroke , Saleh said . That means pursuing aggressive rehab treatment soon after the stroke , but also later down the road . <p> The brain typically has " healthy islands " of functioning brain areas near the stroke , so its important not to let them die off after the stroke .

Everyone knows that Silver Springs flow and pressure has deteriorated significantly over the last 10 years . <p> Because spring flow and pressure were not a problem for 50 years prior to that , SJRWMD staff calculated the average flow and pressure for a 60-year period of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manipulated the data to justify their desire to keep on issuing excessive permits as usual . The public deserves sound science , not a shell game . <p> Politics has gotten in the way of SJRWMD using the best science available to protect our countys water resources . Silver Springs , Rainbow Springs , our rivers and lakes are imperiled . It does n't  take a scientist to see the reductions in water flow at Silver Springs and our freshwater lakes . <p> The governors office , SJRWMD and the City of Ocala , have decided to continue to reduce the water flow from Silver Springs without any plan for restoring those flows with stricter permit management , conservation and reuse measures . Floridas history has proven that making hasty water management decisions , based on political pressure , not sound science , costs us more in the long run . <p> Our leaders at all levels have let us down . They have jeopardized Floridas water resources for ourselves , our children and grandchildren . It is time for new and informed leadership .

While negotiations continue over the budget , there appears little hope that the state colleges , also known as community colleges , will get any sort of reprieve . <p> This is bad business and bad for our state . <p> Most of the money cut by the Legislature was previously earmarked for remediation classes to bring incoming community college students up to speed in math and reading . Because these schools , which serve 800,000 students statewide more than twice the number attending universities , accept any and all comers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , ultimately , the colleges success . <p> While the money cut was earmarked for remediation programs , such funding reductions invariably have a ripple effect throughout the colleges . Moreover , while overall funding for the state colleges is up over a decade ago , the per-student allocation is down about 13 percent . <p> " Dollar for dollar , we have less money to put toward the student , " CF President Jim Henningsen told us . <p> It is confounding that our lawmakers not least being Senate President Joe Negron continually discount the value of our community colleges . Besides preparing young people for university educations , colleges like CF provide college credit programs to our high schools , work with economic development groups to provide job training for employers and , importantly , are responsible for more than half the juniors and senior attending Floridas 12 state universities . <p> Those universities , by the way , received $232 million in increased funding this year . Can someone please explain why the schools that send more than half of those universities students to them are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pensacola State College President told the state Board of Education last month , " Its ironic that they 're giving universities more money to do better and they 're expecting the Florida college system to do more with less . " <p> Make no mistake , these community colleges are cornerstones of the communities they serve . They train local residents to work in law enforcement , public safety , nursing , education and manufacturing on a massive scale . Without them , we would be facing not only a workforce crisis , but economic crisis . <p> If community college supporters feel as if the Legislature demeans those institutions , and they do , it is understandable . CF , for example , has had no funding increase in three years , although its cost of operation continues to go up because things like insurance , utilities and maintenance go up . <p> For its part , CF came out of the budget battle better off than some of its fellow colleges . Henningsen said it took a $500,000 cut in remediation funding but also got $1 million in new recurring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when Gov . Rick Scott vetoed $1.35 million in longstanding funding for the college-owned Appleton Museum . <p> Floridas community colleges are a public asset of incalculable value to the state and its people . Yet , year after year our lawmakers treat it like they are a losing proposition . Nothing could be further from the truth .
