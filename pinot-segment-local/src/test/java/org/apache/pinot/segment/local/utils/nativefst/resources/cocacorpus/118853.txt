A Child Dedication service is an opportunity for parents to publicly declare their intent to raise their child in a way that honors God and also give the child the opportunity to eventually have a personal relationship with Jesus . In many ways a " child dedication " service is truly a " parent dedication " service , as parents publicly declare to raise their child in the faith until the child is old enough to make his own personal confession of Christ . This means a parent can not present themselves for dedication if they are living with someone with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marriage is one man and woman . <p> If your heart is in agreement with the purpose and the motive of a Child Dedication , then we invite you to participate . We consider this a sincere promise to God that flows out of your commitment to Jesus Christ . <p> How does Child Dedication differ from baptism ? Child Dedication is not infant baptism . It does not indicate or assure salvation . While baptism or christening are a significant rite of passage for infants in a variety of faiths , we believe the Bible teaches that baptism is reserved for those who have already made a personal commitment to Jesus Christ , and are old enough to grasp the role of baptism as an outward symbol of their faith . <h> APEX <h> October 22nd - October 29th , 2017 <p> Getting connected with ministry at Life Church is easy , and happens through our two week course , APEX . <p> APEX provides you with vital information about our church and connects you with ministry leaders here at Life Church .

They were theological in that the observance of the festivals presented the participants with lessons on the reality of sin , judgment , and forgiveness , on the need for thanksgiving to God , and on the importance of trusting God rather than hoarding possessions .
