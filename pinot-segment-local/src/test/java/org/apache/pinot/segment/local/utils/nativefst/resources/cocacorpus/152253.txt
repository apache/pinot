A proposal 's overt function is to persuade a committee of scholars that the project shines with the three kinds of merit all disciplines value , namely , conceptual innovation , methodological rigor , and rich , substantive content . But to make these points stick , a proposal writer needs a feel for the unspoken customs , norms , and needs that govern the selection process itself . These are not really as arcane or ritualistic as one might suspect . For the most part , these customs arise from the committee 's efforts to deal in good faith with its own problems : incomprehension among disciplines , work overload , and the problem of equitably judging proposals that reflect unlike social and academic circumstances . 
@@2740826 <p> This article presents evidence of the scale , relative intensity , and social determinants of immigrants transnational political engagement . It demonstrates that a stable and significant transnational field of political action connecting immigrants with their polities of origin does indeed exist . The results temper celebratory images of the extent and effects of transnational engagement provided by some scholars . The article shows that migrants habitual transnational political engagement is far from being as extensive , socially unbounded , deterritorialized , and liberatory as previously argued . Transnational political action , then , is regularly undertaken by a small minority , is socially bounded across national borders , occurs in quite specific territorial jurisdictions , and appears to reproduce preexisting power asymmetries . The potential of transnationalism for transforming such asymmetries within and across countries has yet to be determined . 
@@2740831 @qwx10121 <h> Economic Implications of Remittances and Migration <p> The report has two goals . The first is to explore the gains and losses from international migration from the perspective of developing countries , with special attention to the money that migrants send home . The second goal is to consider policy initiatives that could improve the developmental impact of migration , again with particular attention to remittances . The report focuses on policies to improve the developmental impact of remittances . It documents the high level of transactions costs facing migrants sending small remittances to their families , and it outlines the regulatory issues and market imperfections that keep costs high . Fewer barriers to remittance flows and greater competition among remittance service providers could substantially reduce costs and boost remittance flows to developing countries . The report shows how sound domestic policies and an investment- friendly climate can significantly increase the contribution of remittances and migration to improved living conditions back home .

These discussions have raised questions about everything from maintaining the quality of scholarly publications , to recognizing the value of scholars ' labor , to inevitable concerns about how such projects can be funded . I am by no means an expert on any of these matters , but in my one-time role as the president of the Society for Cultural Anthropology ( SCA ) , I did contribute to important conversations that eventually lead to our journal , Cultural Anthropology , being offered as an open access publication in February 2014 . I can offer some insights from the process of bringing Cultural Anthropology to open access , and the ongoing issues this created , that may be of wider relevance to thinking about the future of open access , as well as of academic publishing more generally . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of publishing journals that are part of the American Anthropological Association ( AAA ) , as Cultural Anthropology is , brought about the specific issues that led to an interest in going open access . Until 2004 , the AAA had a contract with the University of California to publish all of its journals . The individual sections , like the SCA , that published a journal paid for this publishing program . Typically sections that publish journals would collect their members ' dues and budget for the business of running the section , in some instances for a periodic conference , and for publishing costs . What changed in 2004 was that the costs of publication became not only substantially more expensive but largely unpredictable from year to year because AAA journals were bundled together for electronic distribution in a product called AnthroSource . In some instances , the costs of adding electronic publishing were so onerous that many sections felt they would have to shut down , or at least shut down their journals , in order to remain solvent .

Wiley-Blackwell guaranteed substantial royalties for a fixed time period , and , indeed , many journals " including Cultural Anthropology " made substantial revenues under the terms of this contract . <p> At the same time , the idea of publishing with a commercial press did not sit well with many , many members and board members of the SCA .

Those that shared this assessment of for-profit publication " and there were , and are , many " began to ask the AAA to investigate alternative methods of publication , including open access . <p> In 2012 , Oona Schmid , at the time the AAA 's director of publishing , made an offer to all of the sections that published as a part of AnthroSource . One journal would be permitted to go open access so long as it covered the costs of distributing its journal ( i.e. , maintained a website , and all of the complex infrastructure that entails ) for the balance of the time left on the contract with Wiley-Blackwell . The SCA was enthusiastic about this option , but somewhat skeptical as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ convened a task force of some really smart and well-informed scholars who met ( virtually ) over the course of a month or two in order to make a recommendation to the board about whether to pursue this opportunity . Would the SCA retain control over its back catalog so that older articles could be made available through open access ? ( Ten years of content is now available . ) Could the SCA continue to use , for example , the online submission systems , and some of the copy-editing services the AAA and Wiley-Blackwell provided ? ( No , we do that for ourselves . ) Would Cultural Anthropology continue to be part of AnthroSource ? If not , how could we ensure that researchers looking for our content would actually find it ? ( We still are in AnthroSource and it 's a great way for subscribers to find us . ) In the end , this task force did recommend going open access , and got some assurances from the AAA that we felt would allow us to do this in a fair and substantial way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Cultural Anthropology was published . <p> Of course , this was not the end of the story . It was barely the beginning . A host of questions followed from this process . Some concerns are ( relatively ) easily addressed . Can you maintain the publishing standards of a high-impact journal like Cultural Anthropology ? Our board was firmly committed to doing so , and we have . The editorial and peer-review process is unchanged under open access . Cultural Anthropology continues to be one of the leading journals in the world for anthropological research . Part of the way the board maintained this standard was to insist that we continue to employ a managing editor , who is responsible for coordinating many aspects of production , from advising on website organization to selecting grad student interns who generate a great deal of the content that the website hosts . Of course this commitment immediately raises the unavoidable question : who pays for all of this ? One vital point that advocates of open access must make clear : open access does not mean that publication is free.One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : open access does not mean that publication is free. - Somehow the very real expenses of publication ( and they are many , from website architecture to editorial costs to outreach to libraries ) must be met . How can a scholarly society give its journal away freely and still generate the revenue it needs to produce this outstanding publication ? <p> The answer to this question is still very much in the works . For a variety of contingent reasons , the SCA had funds in its accounts that it had saved up over the years that allowed it to buy itself a cushion . In effect , we could finance the conversion to open access and hope that the AAA would join with us and come up with a publication program that could make open access viable for the all of the journals that hoped to pursue it . Moreover , we found that giving away our journal actually increased our membership . Scholars liked the idea of being a part of an innovative and fair publishing model , and were willing to pay section dues even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course , these revenues are not enough to sustain publication indefinitely " though they certainly help . I have come to the view " and it is only my view , based on this experience , and not something the rest of the SCA , or its board , necessarily shares " that making open access viable and sustainable as a publishing platform really depends on questions of scale . If a single scholarly section , like ours , tries to go open access on its own , it can probably pull it off for a few years . But the revenues will not be there in five or ten years if we act entirely independently . What are critical are partnerships that can distribute the costs of publication and " it must be emphasized " share the benefits of open access publishing . For example , if multiple , smaller sections that produce journals agree to share a portion of their membership dues with one another ( or perhaps with one large section ) , they could help share the costs associated with the infrastructure of publishing ( e.g. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ managing editor overseeing multiple submissions processes , etc. ) and everyone could avoid the expense of duplicating these services . Moreover , a number of librarians have contacted me to express their enthusiasm for open access because they have seen subscription costs skyrocket in recent years . If scholarly societies can partner with libraries " perhaps especially libraries at major research universities where subscription costs are so high " it should be possible to figure out a way for these universities to take a fraction of their subscription fees and use them to help subsidize open access publications , thereby reducing their overall subscription costs substantially . Universities could become not customers , or simply benevolent patrons , but actual partners in open access endeavors . Universities could become not customers , or simply benevolent patrons , but actual partners in open access endeavors.This would also mean that libraries would become , in effect , publishers of many of the materials they catalog and curate . And this is an ideal arrangement , as librarians have the very skills and experience that are demanded by this form of knowledge production @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Friends of Cultural Anthropology , which is exploring models that will allow the journal to remain solvent into the future . <p> So what are the wider lessons that can be gleaned from this condensed history of a single journal 's fledgling experience with open access ? Is this a highly idiosyncratic case ? A bellwether for publishing to come ? I certainly hope it is not a cautionary tale ! While the dust is still settling on this transition , there are some important insights to be drawn here . The first is that there is an enormous amount of goodwill and genuine support in the academic world , and perhaps especially in the social sciences where such efforts have been largely tentative thus far , for open access as a project . The almost immediate success of a project like HAU , its ability to recruit some of the most interesting scholarship around , and support a wide range of formats and activities ; and the tremendous enthusiasm with which the SCA 's move to open access has been met clearly demonstrate that this is a direction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The sense of expanded , truly global communities of scholarly participants in these endeavors is palpable . But what follows from the scope and dynamism of these projects are the inevitable questions of cost . These are real challenges , to be sure . Enthusiasm will not pay for talented managing editors in today 's web-based order of things . But enduring collective partnerships do seem to offer genuine hope for a sustainable future . Journals like Cultural Anthropology can serve as case studies that reveal what is required , demonstrate how the highest editorial standards can be maintained , and make explicit what the actual costs of publishing are likely to be going forward . It will undoubtedly take some collective efforts , of imagination and of material commitment , to craft a viable future for open access .

The Social Science Research Councils Measure of America program has collaborated with the American Civil Liberties Union to provide editorially independent research on the intergenerational impacts of lending abuses in the United States on different racial and ethnic groups . This research culminated in a report published in 2015 called Impact of the US Housing Crisis on the Racial Wealth Gap Across Generations . <p> The research was conducted using a dataset called the Panel Study of Income Dynamics of the University of Michigan .

In Mexico and other migrant-sending countries , mass emigration prompts governments to negotiate a new social contract with their citizens abroad . After decades of failed efforts to control outflow , the Mexican state now emphasizes voluntary ties , dual nationality , and rights over obligations . In this groundbreaking book , Fitzgerald examines a region of Mexico whose citizens have been migrating to the United States for more than a century . He finds that emigrant citizenship does not signal the decline of the nation-state but does lead to a new form of citizenship , and that bureaucratic efforts to manage emigration and its effects are based on the membership model of the Catholic Church .

We present concepts from social network analysis ( SNA ) commonly found to influence knowledge flows . We examine applications of SNA from across the social sciences and use the case of land governance in San Juan , Puerto Rico , as an illustration of how all three challenges affect knowledge-action networks .

@@2740965 @qwx10122 <p> In his article , 2013 Transregional Research Postdoctoral fellow Michael John Hathaway explores how global environmental organizations unintentionally fostered the notion of indigenous people and rights in a country that officially opposed these concepts . In the 1990s , Beijing declared itself a supporter of indigenous rights elsewhere , but asserted that , unlike the Americas and Australia , China had no indigenous people . Instead , China described itself as a land of " ethnic minority " groups , not indigenous groups . In some sense , the states declaration appeared effective , as none of these ethnic minority groups launched significant grassroots efforts to align themselves with the international indigenous rights movement . At the same time , as international environmental groups increased in number and strength in 1990s China , their policies were undergoing significant transformations to more explicitly support indigenous people . This article examines how this challenging situation arose , and discusses the unintended consequences after a major environmental organization , The Nature Conservancy ( TNC ) , carried out a project using the language of indigeneity in China .

In this book , Lasso rejects the commonly held belief that subalterns were passive and alienated from Creole-led patriot movements . Instead , the book shows that during Colombia 's revolution , free blacks and mulattos ( pardos ) actively joined and at times led the cause to overthrow the Spanish colonial government . As part of their platform , patriots called for legal racial equality for all citizens , and spread an ideology of fraternity for Colombians of all colors .

Funding for the Abe Fellowship Program is provided by CGP . <h> The Purpose of the Fellowship <p> The Abe Fellowship is designed to encourage international multidisciplinary research on topics of pressing global concern . The program seeks to foster the development of a new generation of researchers who are interested in policy-relevant topics of long-range importance and who are willing to become key members of a bilateral and global research network built around such topics . It strives especially to promote a new level of intellectual cooperation between the Japanese and American academic and professional communities committed to and trained for advancing global understanding and problem solving . <p> Research support to individuals is at the core of the Abe Fellowship Program . Applications are welcome from scholars and nonacademic research professionals . The objectives of the program are to foster high quality research in the social sciences and related disciplines , to build new collaborative networks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to bring new data and new data resources to the attention of those researchers , and to obtain from them a commitment to a comparative or transnational line of inquiry . <p> Successful applicants will be those individuals whose work and interests match these program goals . Abe Fellows are expected to demonstrate a long-term commitment to these goals by participating in program activities over the course of their careers . <h> The Abe Fellowship Research Agenda <p> Applicants are invited to submit proposals for research in the social sciences and related disciplines relevant to any one or any combination of the four themes below . The themes are : <p> 3 ) Social , Scientific , and Cultural Trends and Transformations Especially welcome topics include aging and other demographic change , benefits and dangers of reproductive genetics , gender and social exclusion , expansion of STEM education among women and under-represented populations , migration , rural depopulation and urbanization , impacts of automation on jobs , poverty and inequality , and community resilience . <p> 4 ) Governance , Empowerment , and Participation Especially welcome topics include challenges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the changing role of NGO/NPOs , the rise of new media , and government roles in fostering innovation . <p> Across the program 's four dominant themes , projects should demonstrate important contributions to intellectual and/or policy debates and break new theoretical or empirical ground . Within this framework , priority is given to research projects that help formulate solutions that promote a more peaceful , stable , and equitable global society or ameliorate the challenges faced by communities worldwide . Applicants are expected to show how the proposed project goes beyond previous work on the topic and builds on prior skills to move into new intellectual terrain . <p> Please note that the purpose of this Fellowship is to support research activities . Therefore , projects whose sole aim is travel , cultural exchange , and/or language training will not be considered . However , funds for language tutoring or refresher courses in the service of research goals will be included in the award if the proposal includes explicit justification for such activities . <p> Rather than seeking to promote greater understanding of a single countryJapan or the United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ global perspective . The program promotes deeply contextualized cross-cultural research . <p> The Abe Fellowship Program Committee seeks applications for research explicitly focused on policy-relevant and contemporary issues with a comparative or transnational perspective that draw the study of the United States and Japan into wider disciplinary or theoretical debates . <h> Policy Relevance <p> The program defines policy-relevant research as the study of existing public policies for the purpose of ( a ) deepening understanding of those policies and their consequences and ( b ) formulating more effective policies . Policy relevance can also be found in research questions that are pertinent to understanding public dialogue on contemporary issues of concern to various sectors of society . All proposals are expected to directly address policy relevance in theme , project description , and project structure . <p> Contemporary Focus <p> The program is concerned with present day issues and debates . Thus , proposals in history or with a historical component must demonstrate how the research is specifically intended to inform contemporary concerns . <p> Comparative or Transnational Perspectives <p> The Abe Fellowship Program does not support research on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ processes , problems , and issues across time and space . Successful proposals will explicitly address how the project will be comparative or transnational in construction and goals . <p> Typically projects involve data collection in more than one country or across several time periods . Data from a single country may be collected under the auspices of the fellowship only if the purpose of collecting that data is explicitly comparative or transnational . Single-country proposals that merely imply that the data have broader comparative relevance will be eliminated from the fellowship competition . Further , it is not sufficient for a proposal to implicitly suggest a comparative perspective because of the pervasive or global distribution of the phenomenon being studied . <h> Eligibility <p> This competition is open to citizens of the United States and Japan as well as to nationals of other countries who can demonstrate strong and serious long-term affiliations with research communities in Japan or the United States . <p> Applicants must hold a PhD or the terminal degree in their field , or have attained an equivalent level of professional experience at the time of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for this fellowship .

You may hold only one fellowship sponsored by the Japan Foundation , which includes the Abe Fellowship , during any one Japanese fiscal year , which runs from April 1 through March 31 . Current recipients of a Japan Foundation Fellowship and those who will commence that fellowship by March 31 , 2017 , are ineligible to apply for an Abe Fellowship in 2016 .

The book conceptualizes markets as institutions , and analyzes them as a system of climate governance .

@@2741043 @qwx10122 <h> Realism After Modernism : The Rehumanization of Art and Literature <p> The human figure made a spectacular return in visual art and literature in the 1920s . Following modernism 's withdrawal , nonobjective painting gave way to realistic depictions of the body and experimental literary techniques were abandoned for novels with powerfully individuated characters . But the celebrated return of the human in the interwar years was not as straightforward as it may seem . In Realism after Modernism , 2001 IDRF Fellow Devin Fore challenges the widely accepted view that this period represented a return to traditional realist representation and its humanist postulates . Interwar realism , he argues , did not reinstate its nineteenth-century predecessor but invoked realism as a strategy of mimicry that anticipates postmodernist pastiche . Through close readings of a series of works by German artists and writers of the period , Fore investigates five artistic devices that were central to interwar realism . He analyzes Bauhaus polymath Lszl= Moholy-Nagy 's use of linear perspective ; three industrial novels riven by the conflict between the temporality of capital and that of labor ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ principles for depicting a collective subject ; a memoir by Carl Einstein that oscillates between recollection and self-erasure ; and the idiom of physiognomy in the photomontages of John Heartfield . Fore 's readings reveal that each of these " rehumanized " works in fact calls into question the very categories of the human upon which realist figuration is based . Paradoxically , even as the human seemed to make a triumphal return in the culture of the interwar period , the definition of the human and the integrity of the body were becoming more tenuous than ever before . Interwar realism did not hearken back to earlier artistic modes but posited new and unfamiliar syntaxes of aesthetic encounter , revealing the emergence of a human subject quite unlike anything that had come before .

The institute 's founders believed that the estrangement of intellectuals from the general public had contributed to the rise of fascism . To address this , they sought to develop a " science of thought " that would reconnect the world of ideas with everyday experience and thus reimagine Japan as a democratic nation , home to one hundred million philosophers . To tell the story of Science of Thought and postwar democracy , Bronson weaves together several strands of Japan 's modern history that are often treated separately : the revival of interest in the social sciences and Marxism after the war , the appearance of new social movements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ascendance of a mass middle-class culture . This story is transnational in both connective and comparative senses .

They also derived inspiration from other efforts to promote a culture of democracy , ranging from thought reform campaigns in the People 's Republic of China to the Mass Observation study of the British working classes . By tracing these sources of inspiration around the world , Bronson reveals the contours of a transnational intellectual milieu . Science of Thought embodied a vision of democratic experimentation that had to be re-articulated repeatedly in response to challenges that arose in connection with geopolitical events and social change , prompting the group 's evolution from a small research circle in the 1940s into the standard-bearer for citizen activism in the 1960s .

@@2741104 <h> The Immanent Frame <p> Its tough to imagine a better precursor to todays interfaithor inter-civilizational , or whatever you want to call itdialogue : at the height of the Fifth Crusade in the summer of 1219 , St. Francis of Assisi traveled to the battlefield at Damietta , Egypt , went behind enemy lines , met with Sultan Malik al-Kamil , and then returned to Europe to continue his career as one of the great medieval saints . There may even have been a miraculous gauntlet of fire involved , depending on which of the various contrasting reports from the period you read . Really , besides a few basic facts , the reports agree on very little , least of all on what we might now want from the story most . <p> When I first learned about the encounterit was the subject of a college paper I wrote in 2005I found few modern sources to draw from . As I gathered every early account I could , it amazed me that , in the post-9/11 world , a bigger deal was n't being made of Francis adventure . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half the foreheads in the packed room marked by Ash Wednesday smears , Fordham Universitys Center on Religion and Culture sponsored a forum with four authors who have recently written about it : two historians , a Franciscan sister , and a journalist . <p> Among them , journalist Paul Moses ( author of The Saint and the Sultan : The Crusades , Islam , and Francis of Assisis Mission of Peace ) and Kathleen Warren , OSF ( author of Daring to Cross the Threshold : Francis of Assisi Encounters Sultan Malek al-Kamil ) , especially , came with a mission . Moses portrayed Francis as a PTSD-suffering war veteran who renounced violence and sought a peaceful alternative to the carnage of the crusades . Warren , in turn , gave an on-screen presentation that periodically displayed , in screaming 3-D block letters , the words " Universal Fraternity . " She argued that , upon his return to Europe , Francis promoted Christian adaptations of Muslim prayer rituals and urged his friars to live under Muslim rule . The encounter , she contended , was nothing if not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " that we would do well to replicate . <p> The historians would n't jump to conclusions so easily . John Tolan , who teaches at the University of Nantes in France and is author of Saint Francis and the Sultan : The Curious History of a Christian-Muslim Encounter , showed a succession of paintings representing the event over the course of the centuries . In each , the assumptions and ambitions of the particular time and place rearrange the scene to serve certain pressing political needs . His final slide , which turned out to be Warrens first and last slide also , was a modern representation of Francis and the sultan embracing as equals . This vision of a cordial pow-wow , Tolan warned , may be more an image of ourselves than of trustworthy historical truth . <p> After all , several of the earliest sources present the event as a rather confrontational one , with Francis as a cheerleader for the Crusade who hoped for nothing other than to convert the Saracen then and there by miraculous acts , and with the sultan as a hard-hearted tempter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Order was fighting against heresy charges , is the most triumphal . But Warren and Moses insisted that , with the documents and scholarship now available to us , we really can wade through the politics to arrive at truth , and the truth is peace . <p> There are unfortunately no accounts of the event from the sultans point of view , explained Adnan Husain , who teaches at Queens University in Canada and is the author of Identity Polemics : Encounters with Islam in the Medieval Mediterranean World ( 1150-1300 ) . One reason he offered was simply that such dialogues were so common in the Islamicate world at the time ; Jews and Christians were a vital presence in the cosmopolitan cities of Muslim-ruled lands , and public debates among the religions were a popular sport . Moses added to this the fact that , as far back as the Quran , Muslims have harbored a fascination and respect for Christian desert ascetics , whom Francis , in his simple robes and visible poverty , would have resembled . Husains suggestion was that while the real story @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we can find abundant inspiration for modern dialogue in that period , in the courts of many sultans , and in the streets of cities across the southern Mediterranean . <p> One might ask , of course , why we tempt the urge to cherry-pick through history in the first place , when the presents need for dialogue should be so plainly and urgently clear . Why wait for history to provide a poignant exemplar ? Ideally , I suppose , these discussions of things long-gone are the dialogue in action , the opportunities to build a shared telling of history that accounts for both sides of the story together . Yet it would be a mistake to hinge the dialogue too much on the premise of an event built from contradictory evidence and a one-sided telling .

@@2741152 <p> The Globalization of Informal Violence , Theories of World Politics , and " The Liberalism of Fear " Robert O. Keohane , Professor of Political Science , Duke University <p> The attacks on the United States on September 11 , 2001 , have incalculable consequences for domestic politics and world affairs . Reliable predictions about these consequences are impossible . However , it may be worthwhile , even at this early point , to reflect on what these acts of violence reveal about the adequacy of our theories of world politics . In what respects have our assumptions and our analytical models helped us to understand these events , and responses to them ? And in what ways have we been misled by our theories ? <p> In this short article , I will not attempt to be comprehensive . Instead , I will focus instead on specific issues on which my commentary may be of some value , without presuming that these are the most important issues to address . For instance , the attacks of September 11 reveal that all mainstream theories of world politics are relentlessly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of religion , despite the fact that world-shaking political movements have so often been fueled by religious fervor . None of them takes very seriously the human desire to dominate or to hate - both so strong in history and in classical realist thought . Most of them tend to assume that the world is run by those whom Joseph Schumpeter ( 1950 1942 : 137 ) called " rational and unheroic " members of the bourgeoisie . After September 11 we need also to keep in mind another motivation : the belief , as expressed by Osama bin Laden , that terrorism against " infidels " will assure one " a supreme place in heaven . " 1 However , since I have few insights into religious motivations in world politics , I will leave this subject to whose who are more qualified to address it . <p> In the next section of this article I define the phrase , " the globalization of informal violence . " In referring to a general category of action , I substitute this phrase for " terrorism , " since the latter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to define in an analytically neutral and consistent way that commands general acceptance.2 Even as the United Nations Security Council has passed resolutions against terrorism , it has been unable to define the term . Since everyone is against terrorism , the debate shifts to its definition , as each party seeks to define its enemy 's acts , but not its own , as terrorist . Nevertheless , deliberately targeted surprise attacks on arbitrarily chosen civilians , designed to frighten other people , are clearly acts of terror . The attacks on the World Trade Center of September 11 , 2001 , were therefore terrorist acts and I refer to them as such . <p> This paper has three themes . First , the events of September 11 illustrate starkly how our assumptions about security are conceived in terms of increasingly obsolescent views of geographical space . Secondly , the globalization of informal violence can be analyzed by exploring patterns of asymmetrical interdependence and their implications for power . Thirdly , United States responses to the attacks tell us quite a bit about the role of multilateral institutions in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theories provide important components of an adequate post-September 11 conceptualization of world politics , but that we need to alter some of our assumptions in order to rearrange these components into a viable theoretical framework . Effective wielding of large-scale violence by non-state actors reflects new patterns of asymmetrical interdependence , and calls into question some of our assumptions about geographical space as a barrier . Responses to these actions reveal the significance of international institutions as well as the continuing central role of states . In thinking about these issues , students of world politics can be usefully reminded of Judith N. Shklar 's concept of the " liberalism of fear , " and her argument that the most basic function of a liberal state is to protect its citizens from the fear of cruelty . <p> 1 . The Globalization of Informal Violence and the Reconceptualization of Space <p> The various definitions of globalization in social science all converge on the notion that human activities across regions and continents are being increasingly linked together , as a result both of technological and social change ( Held et al. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been defined as " a state of the world involving networks of interdependence at multicontinental distances , linked through flows of capital and goods , information and ideas , people and force , as well as environmentally and biologically relevant substances " ( Keohane and Nye 2001 : 229 ) . <p> When globalism is characterized as multidimensional , as in these definitions , the expansion of terrorism 's global reach is an instance of globalization ( Held et al . 1999 : 80 ; Keohane and Nye 2001 : 237 ) . Often , globalism and globalization have been defined narrowly as economic integration on a global scale ; but whatever appeal such a definition may have had , it has surely disappeared after September 11 . To adopt it would be to imply that globalized informal violence , which takes advantage of modern technologies of communication , transportation , explosives , and potentially biology , somehow threatens to hinder or reduce the level of globalism . But like military technology between 1914 and 1945 , globalized informal violence strengthens one dimension of globalism - the networks through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along other dimensions , such as economic and social exchange . As in the past , not all aspects of globalization go together . <p> I define informal violence as violence by non-state actors , capitalizing on secrecy and surprise to inflict great harm with small material capabilities . Such violence is " informal " because it is not wielded by formal state institutions and it is typically not announced in advance , as in a declaration of war . Such violence becomes globalized when the networks of non-state actors operate on an intercontinental basis , so that acts of force in one society can be initiated and controlled from very distant points of the globe . <p> The implications of the globalization of formal violence were profound for traditional conceptions of foreign policy in an earlier generation , particularly in the United States , which had so long been insulated by distance from invasion and major direct attack . The great expositors of classical realist theories of foreign policy in the United States , such as Walter Lippmann , began with the premise that defense of the " continental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Before World War II , threats to the homeland could only stem from other states that secured territory contiguous to that of the United States or that controlled ocean approaches to it . Hence the Monroe Doctrine of 1823 was the cornerstone of American national security policy . As Lippmann recognized in 1943 , changes in the technologies of formal violence meant that security policy needed to be more ambitious : the United States would have to maintain coalitions with other great powers that would " form a combination of indisputably preponderant power " ( Lippmann 1943 : 88 , 101 ) . Nevertheless , Lippmann was able to retain a key traditional concept : that of a geographically defined defensive perimeter , which can be thought of as a set of concentric circles . If the United States were to control not only its own area but the circle surrounding that area , comprising littoral regions of Europe and Asia , its homeland would be secure . <p> The American strategists of the 1950s - led by Bernard Brodie , Thomas Schelling , and Albert Wohlstetter - had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intercontinental ballistic missiles reduced the significance of distance : that is , as formal violence became globalized . John Herz ( 1959 : 107-108 ) argued that nuclear weapons forced students of international politics to rethink sovereignty , territoriality , and the protective function of the state : <p> " With the advent of the atomic weapon , whatever remained of the impermeability of states seems to have gone for good .... Mencius , in ancient China , when asked for guidance in matters of defense and foreign policy by the ruler of a small state , is said to have counseled : ' dig deeper your moats ; build higher your walls ; guard them along with your people . ' This remained the classical posture up to our age , when a Western sage , Bertrand Russell , could still , even in the interwar period , define power as a force radiating from one center and diminishing with the distance from that center until it finds an equilibrium with that of similar geographically anchored units . Now that power can destroy power from center to center everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ violence has become globalized , just as formal , state-controlled violence became globalized , for the superpowers , during the 1950s . The globalization of informal violence was not created by September 11 . Indeed , earlier examples , extending back to piracy in the 17th century , can be easily found . But the significance of globalization - of violence as well as economically and socially - is not its absolute newness but its increasing magnitude as a result of sharp declines in the costs of global communications and transportation ( Keohane and Nye 2001 : 243-45 ) . <p> Contemporary theorists of world politics face a challenge similar to that of this earlier generation : to understand the nature of world politics , and its connections to domestic politics , when what Herz called the " hard shell " of the state ( Herz 1959 : 22 ) has been shattered . Geographical space , which has been seen as a natural barrier and a locus for human barriers , now must be seen as a carrier as well . <p> The corollary to the barrier conception of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ countries , without nuclear weapons , far from the defensive perimeter , consigned to a " the obscurity that they justly deserve . " One of the finest hours of American realism was its opposition to the war in Vietnam on just these grounds . Walter Lippmann and Hans J. Morgenthau opposed the war not for moralistic reasons , but because of Vietnam 's unimportance to the national interests of the United States . For Lippmann , the key to a successful foreign policy is achieving a " balance , with a comfortable surplus of power in reserve , between the nation 's commitment and the nation 's power " ( Lippmann 1943 : 9 ) . Going abroad in search of monsters to destroy upset that balance . <p> The globalization of informal violence , carried out by networks of non-state actors , defined by commitments rather than by territory , has profoundly changed these fundamental foreign policy assumptions.3 On traditional grounds of national interest , Afghanistan should be one of the least important places in the world for American foreign policy - and until the Soviet invasion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Union in 1991 until September 11 , the United States all but ignored it . Yet in October 2001 it became the theatre of war . Globalization means , among other things , that threats of violence to our homeland can occur from anywhere . The barrier conception of geographical space , already anachronistic with respect to thermonuclear war and called into question by earlier acts of globalized informal violence , was finally shown to be thoroughly obsolete on September 11.4 <p> 2 . Interdependence and Power <p> Another way to express the argument made above is that networks of interdependence , involving transmission of informal violence , have now taken a genuinely global form . Using this language helps us to see the relevance for the globalization of informal violence of the literature on interdependence and power , which was originally developed to understand international political economy . In that literature , interdependence is conceptualized as mutual dependence , and power is conceptualized in terms of asymmetrical interdependence.5 This literature has also long been clear that " military power dominates economic power in the sense that economic means alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ military force " ( Keohane and Nye 2001 : 14 ) . <p> September 11 revealed how much the United States could be hurt by informal violence , to an extent that had been anticipated by some government reports but that had not been incorporated into the plans of the government.6 The long-term vulnerability of the United States is not entirely clear , but the availability of means of mass destruction , the extent of hatred for the United States , and the ease of entering the United States from almost anywhere in the world , all suggest that vulnerability may be quite high . <p> If the United States were facing a territorial state with conventional objectives , this vulnerability might not be a source of worry . After all , the United States has long been much more vulnerable , in technological terms , to a nuclear attack from Russia . But the United States was not asymmetrically vulnerable . On the contrary , the United States either had superior nuclear capability or " mutual assured destruction " ( MAD ) kept vulnerability more or less symmetrical . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power over the United States from its arsenal . <p> With respect to terrorism , however , two asymmetries , which do not normally characterize relationships between states , favored wielders of informal violence in September 2001 . First , there was an asymmetry of information . It seems paradoxical that an " information society " such as that of the contemporary United States would be at an informational disadvantage with respect to networks of individuals whose communications seem to occur largely through hand-written messages and face-to-face contacts . But an information society is also an open society . Potential terrorists had good information about their targets , while before September 11 the United States had poor information about the identity and location of terrorist networks within the United States and other western societies . Perhaps equally important , the United States was unable coherently to process the information that its various agencies had gathered . Secondly , there is an asymmetry in beliefs . Some of Osama bin Laden 's followers apparently believed that they would be rewarded in the afterlife for committing suicidal attacks on civilians . Others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their suicidal purpose . Clearly , the suicidal nature of the attacks made them more difficult to prevent and magnified their potential destructive power . Neither volunteering for suicide missions nor deliberately targeting civilians is consistent with secular beliefs widely shared in the societies attacked by al-Qaeda . <p> The United States and its allies have enormous advantages in resources , including military power , economic resources , political influence , and technological capabilities . Furthermore , communications media , largely based in the West , give greater weight to the voices of people in the wealthy democracies than to those of the dispossessed in developing countries . Hence the asymmetries in information and beliefs that I have mentioned are , in a sense , exceptional . They do not confer a permanent advantage on the wielders of informal violence . Yet they were sufficient to give the terrorists at least a short-term advantage , and they make terrorism a long-term threat . <p> Our failure to anticipate the impact of terrorist attacks does not derive from a fundamental conceptual failure in thinking about power . On the contrary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , derives from asymmetrical patterns of interdependence . Our fault has rather been our failure to understand that the most powerful state ever to exist on this planet could be vulnerable to small bands of terrorists due to patterns of asymmetrical interdependence . We have overemphasized states and we have over-aggregated power . <p> Power comes not simply out of the barrel of a gun , but from asymmetries in vulnerability interdependence - some of which , it turns , out , favor certain non-state actors more than most observers anticipated . The networks of interdependence along which power can travel are multiple , and they do not cancel one another out . Even a state that is overwhelmingly powerful on many dimensions can be highly vulnerable on others . We learned this lesson in the 1970s with respect to oil power ; we are re-learning it now with respect to terrorism . <p> 3 . Institutions and Legitimacy <p> Institutionalist theory implies that multilateral institutions should play significant roles wherever interstate cooperation is extensive in world politics Yet a reader of the American press immediately after the September 11 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Pentagon , might well have thought this claim weirdly divorced from reality . Immediate reactions centered on domestic security , military responses , and the creation of a broad international coalition against terrorism . Although the United Nations Security Council did act on September 12 , passing resolution 1368 , its response attracted relatively little attention . Indeed , President Bush 's speech to Congress of September 20 did not mention the United Nations , although the President did praise NATO and made a generic reference to international organizations . And coverage of the United Nations was virtually nonexistent in the New York Times . <p> But theory is not tested by the immediate reactions of policymakers , much less by those of the press . Social science theory purports to elucidate underlying structures of social reality , which generate incentives for action . Kenneth Waltz rightly looks for confirmation of his theory of the balance of power " through observation of difficult cases . " The theory is confirmed , he claims , where states ally with each other , " in accordance with the expectations the theory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not to cooperate with one another " ( Waltz 1979 : 125 ) . Realists rightly argue that if leaders seem to be compelled toward actions that theory suggests - as , for instance , Winston Churchill was when Britain allied with the Soviet Union in 1941 and American leaders when they built NATO after World War II - this counts for their theory . Indeed , the most demanding test of theory comes when policymakers are initially unreceptive to the arguments on which the theory is based . If they nevertheless turn to the policy measures that the theory anticipates , it gains support . <p> The terrorist attacks of September 11 therefore pose a fruitful test for institutionalist theory . Before September 11 , the Bush Administration had been pursuing a notably unilateralist policy with respect to several issues , including global warming , trade in small arms , money laundering , and tax evasion . Its leading policymakers all had realist proclivities : they emphasized the decisive use of force and had not been public supporters of international institutions . Their initial inclinations , if their public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not lead them to emphasize the role of the United Nations . <p> Nevertheless , the United States returned to the Security Council . On September 28 , 2001 , the Security Council unanimously adopted Resolution 1373 , on the motion of the United States . This resolution used the mandatory provisions of Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter to require all states to " deny safe haven " both to terrorists and to those who " provide safe haven " to terrorists . Resolution 1373 also demanded that states prevent potential terrorists from using their territories , and " prevent and suppress the financing of terrorist acts . " It did not , as noted above , define terrorism . Furthermore , the United States continued to engage the United Nations , indeed delegating to it the task of bringing Afghan factions together in Germany in a meeting that culminated in an agreement in December 2001 . <p> Why should the United States have relied so extensively on the United Nations ? The UN , in Stalin 's famous phrase , has no divisions . The United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ military actions . Transnational banks , central banks , and states in their capacities as bank regulators , froze funds allegedly belonging to terrorists . Even before the September 28 Security Council resolution , allies of the United States had already invoked Article 5 of NATO 's Charter . <p> Inis L. Claude proposed one answer almost 35 years ago ( Claude 1967 ) . States seek " collective legitimation " for their policies in the United Nations . Only the UN can provide the breadth of support for an action that can elevate it from the policy of one country or a limited set of countries , to a policy endorsed on a global basis . In contemporary jargon , the " transaction costs " of seeking support from over 150 countries around the world are higher than those of going to the Security Council , ready to meet at a moment 's notice . But more important than these costs is the fact that the institution of the United Nations can confer a certain degree of legitimacy on a policy favored by the United States . <p> What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the United Nations Security Council on issues of involving the use of violence are legitimate since members of the United Nations , through the Charter , have authorized such decisions . In a broader popular and normative sense , decisions are legitimate for a given public insofar as members of that public believe that they should be obeyed . As Weber pointed out , the sources of such legitimacy may include tradition , charisma or rational-legal authority ( Weber 1978 : 954 ) ; they may also include appeal to widely accepted norms . People in various parts of the world may believe that their governments should obey decisions of the Security Council because they were made through a process that is normatively as well as legally acceptable . Or they may regard its decisions as legitimate insofar as they are justified on the basis of principles - such as collective opposition to aggression - that they regard as valid . <p> Why is legitimacy important ? In part , because people will voluntarily support a legitimacy policy , without requiring material inducements.7 But it would be naive to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Security Council action , of the wisdom or righteousness of the policy and will therefore support it for normative reasons . To explain the impact of Security Council resolutions , we need also to look for self-interested benefits for leaders . <p> Even if the leaders are entirely cynical , the adoption of a legitimate UN resolution will change their calculations . If they lead democratic societies in which publics accept the legitimacy of UN action , they will benefit more politically from supporting policies endorsed by the United Nations , than from supporting policies not so endorsed . If they exercise rule over people who are unsympathetic to the policies and who do not accept them merely due to UN endorsement , the legal status of Security Council resolutions may change their calculations . Chapter VII decisions are mandatory , which means that states defying the Security Council run the risk of facing sanctions themselves , as in the Gulf War . Leaders of countries with unsympathetic populations can point out that , however distasteful it may be to take action against Osama bin Laden and his network @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from essential supplies and markets , to suffer disruption of transportation and banking services , or even to become a target of military action . <p> The general point is one that has often been made by institutional theory : international institutions work largely by altering the costs of state strategies . Of course , there is no guarantee that institutions will be sufficiently important to ensure that strategies change : they are only one element in a mixture of calculations . Yet as the use of the United Nations by the United States indicates , they are an element that should not be overlooked . <p> The general issue of whether the United States should secure multilateral endorsement of its policies takes us back to issues of interdependence and power . The focused terrorist attacks on the United States have made the United States more dependent on other states for assistance in its struggle . Reciprocity requires that in return for such assistance , the United States provide benefits to its partners . Some of these benefits are bilateral , but others are more efficiently provided through multilateral institutions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stronger signals and make more credible commitments . Hence terrorism directed against the United States is likely to make the United States more responsive to its partners - both partners in crucial regions , such as Pakistan , and the most important entities on a global basis , such as China , Russia and the European Union . Terrorism may also make the United States more receptive to the use of multilateral institutions even when they limit American freedom of action . <p> In the short run , multilateralism may be a beneficiary of the globalization of informal violence . A major reason for a government to commit itself to a multilateral policy is that it can thereby induce other governments to make valuable reciprocal commitments . The United States has greater need for commitments from other states now than it had before September 11 , and is therefore more inclined to make reciprocal commitments of its own . Greater multilateralism with respect to security issues is the direct result . Indirectly , due to issue-linkage , more American concessions on other issues can also be expected . These concessions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ multilateralism on these issues , as a way of improving relations with states whose help the United States needs to fight terrorism , and the support of whose people the United States seeks . <p> Yet at this point a note of caution is necessary . The United States has been notably reluctant to permit the United Nations , or its own allies , to restrict its military freedom of action in Afghanistan . In fact , requests by Great Britain to send in troops to protect relief operations were rebuffed by the United States on the advice of its military commanders . Another interpretation of the delegation of inter-factional negotiations to the United Nations is that the United States seeks to be able to leave Afghanistan promptly after the defeat of the Taliban and the capture or killing of Bin Laden and al-Qaeda fighters . Even more cynically , it can be feared that American policymakers wish to be able to lay the blame for inevitable political difficulties as the door of the UN . <p> One can easily imagine a more pessimistic scenario for the next few years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ required radical measures that would not be supported even by many of its NATO allies , such as an attack on Iraq without strong evidence of Iraqi complicity in prior attacks on the United States . In such an eventuality , American actions would not be legitimated either by the United Nations or by NATO . Having acted unilaterally , the United States would not be moved to rely more heavily on international institutions , and multilateralism could suffer a serious blow . <p> Even if the multilateral path is chosen , it is hardly likely to be sufficient . It is unlikely that multilateral organizations will be the key operating agencies in dealing with the globalization of informal violence : they are too cumbersome for that . The state , with its capacity for decisive , forceful action and the loyalty it commands from citizens , will remain a necessary part of the solution to threats of informal violence . Jejeune declarations of the " death of the state " are surely among the casualties of the terrorist offensive But multilateral organizations will be an essential part of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be evident that these arguments about multilateral institutions and networks are not " anti-realist . " On the contrary , they rest on an appreciation of the role of power , and of state action , in world politics ; on an understanding that new threats create new alliances ; and on a belief that structures matter . Analysts who are sensitive to the role of multilateral institutions need not regard them as operating independently from states , nor should they see such institutions as a panacea for our new ills . But sensitivity to the role of multilateral institutions helps us see how these institutions can play a role : not only by reducing transaction costs but also by generating opportunities for signalling commitments and providing collective legitimacy for effective action . <p> 4 . The " Liberalism of Fear " <p> Judith N. Shklar 's " liberalism of fear " envisages liberal democracy as " more a recipe for survival than a project for the perfectibility of mankind . " It seeks to avoid the worst outcomes , and therefore declares that " the first right is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1984 : 4 ; 237 ) . The liberalism of fear certainly speaks to our condition today , as it did to that of victims of the Nazis such as Judith Shklar . It raises both an analytical and a normative issue . Analytically , it leads us to ask about the protective role of the state , facing the globalization of informal violence . Normatively , it should make us think about our own role as students of world politics . <p> The erosion of the concept of a protected homeland within a defensive perimeter , discussed above , makes the " liberalism of fear " more relevant to Americans than it has been in almost two centuries . Suddenly , the task of protecting citizens from the fear of cruelty has become a demanding project for the state , not one that a superpower can take for granted . <p> Judith Shklar looked to the state as the chief threat . " No liberal , " she declared , " ever forgets that governments are coercive " ( Shklar 1984 : 244 ) . In this respect , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the most popular theories of world politics , including realism , institutionalism and some forms of constructivism . All of these views share a common fault : they do not sufficiently take account of how globalization facilitates the agency of non-state entities and networks . After September 11 no liberal should be able to forget that non-state actors , operating within the borders of liberal states , can be as coercive and fear-inducing as states . <p> Recognition of the dangers of informal violence may lead the United States toward a broader vision of its global interests . As we have seen , classical realist thinking drew a bright line between geographical areas important to the national interest and those parts of the world that were insignificant from the standpoint of interests . Now that attacks against the United States can be planned and fostered within countries formerly viewed as insignificant , this bright line has been blurred . <p> One of the implications of this blurring of lines is that the distinction between self-defense and humanitarian intervention may become less clear . Future military actions in failed states @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of failing , may be more likely to be described both as self-defense and as humanitarian or public-spirited . When the only arguments for such policies were essentially altruistic ones , they commanded little support , so the human and material price that American leaders were willing to pay to attain them was low . Now , however , such policies can be framed in terms of American self-interest , properly understood . Sound arguments from self-interest are more persuasive than arguments from responsibility or altruism . <p> More generally , recognition of the dangers of informal violence will force a redefinition of American national interests , which could take different forms . Such a redefinition could lead Americans to support measures to reduce poverty , inequality and injustice in poor countries . The Marshall Plan is a useful if imperfect analogy . In 1947 the United States redefined its self-interest , taking responsibility for helping to build a democratic and capitalist Europe , open to other capitalist democracies . The United States invested very large resources in this project , with great success . The task now in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sheer magnitude and since the political systems of most of these countries are weaker than those of European countries in 1947.8 But the resources available to the United States and other democratic countries are also much greater than they were in 1947 . <p> Any widely appealing vision of American interests will need to be based on core values that can be generalized . Individual freedom , economic opportunity , and representative democracy constitute such values . The ability to derive gas-guzzling sports utility vehicles ( SUVs ) does not . In the end , " soft power " ( Nye 1990 ) depends not merely on the desire of people in one country to imitate the institutions and practices prevailing in another , but also their ability to do so . Exhibiting a glamorous lifestyle that others have no possibility of attaining is more likely to generate hostility and a feeling of " sour grapes " than support . To relate successfully to people in poor countries during the 21st century , Americans will have to distinguish between their values and their privileges . <p> The attachment of Americans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and reactionary broadening of American national interests . Recall that a virtue of classical realism was to link commitments to a relatively limited set of interests , defined partly by geography . Ideology and a self-serving attempt to preserve privileges could define a different set of interests . Opponents - not merely those who have attacked the United States - would be demonized . Deals would continue to be cut with corrupt and repressive regimes to keep cheap oil flowing to the United States . The United States would rely exclusively on military power and bilateral deals rather than also on economic assistance , trade benefits , and efforts at cultural understanding . The costs would include estrangement from our democratic allies and hatred of the United States in much of the world . Ultimately , such a vision of national interest is a recipe for isolation and continual conflict - an environment in which liberal democracy could be threatened by the emergence of a garrison state at home . <p> Normatively , thinking about the " liberalism of fear " reminds our generation that in a globalized world , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as Judith Shklar , who experienced Nazism , understood the fear of cruelty in their bones . Those of us who grew up in the United States during the Cold War experienced such fear only in our imaginations , although nuclear threats and wars such as those in Korea and Vietnam gave our imaginations plenty to work with . The generations that have come of age in the United States since the mid-to-late 1980s - essentially , those people under 35 - have been able to take the basics of liberalism for granted , as if the United States were insulated from the despair of much of the world 's population . The globalization of informal violence means that we are not so insulated . We are linked with hateful killers by real physical connections , not merely those of cyberspace . Neither isolationism nor unilateralism is a viable option . <p> Hence , the liberalism of fear means that we who study international interdependence and multilateral institutions will need to redouble our efforts . We should pay less attention to differentiating our views from those of other schools @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We need to synthesize insights from classical realism , institutionalism , and constructivism , but we also need to take alternative worldviews - including religious worldviews - more seriously . We need to examine how purposes are shaped by ideas and how calculations of power interact with institutions , to produce outcomes in world politics . We need , at the same time , to disaggregate strands of asymmetrical interdependence , with their different implications for power ; and to differentiate international institutions and networks from one another , in their effects and their potential for good or i 'll . <p> Conclusion <p> The terrorist attacks on New York and Washington force us to rethink our theories of world politics . Globalism should not be equated with economic integration . The agents of globalization are not simply the high-tech creators of the internet , or multinational corporations , but also small bands of fanatics , travelling on jet aircraft and inspired by fundamentalist religion . The globalization of informal violence has rendered problematic our conventional assumptions about security threats . It should also lead us to question the classical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which great powers have interests , and insignificant places , which were thought to present no security threats although they may raise moral dilemmas . Indeed , we need to reconceptualize the significance for homeland security of geographical space , which can be as much a carrier of malign informal violence as a barrier to it . <p> Most problematic are the assumptions in international relations theory about the roles played by states . There has been too much " international relations , " and too little " world politics , " not only in work on security but also in much work on international institutions . States no longer have a monopoly on the means of mass destruction : more people died in the attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon than in the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941 . Indeed , it would be salutary for us to change the name of our field , from " international relations " to " world politics . " 9 The language of " international " relations enables us to slip back into state-centric assumptions too easily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Yet as the state loses its monopoly on means of mass destruction , the response to terrorism is strengthening the powers of states , and the reliance of people on government . Even as states acquire more authority , they are likely to cooperate more extensively with each other on security issues , using international institutions to do so . Ironically , as states acquire more authority , they will be forced to learn better how to relate to networks - both hostile networks and networks that they may use instrumentally - and to rely more heavily on multilateral institutions . These institutions , in turn , will have to define their tasks in ways that emphasize their advantages - in conferring collective legitimacy on actions - while minimizing the impact of their liabilities , as cumbersome organizations without unity of command . <p> One result of these apparently paradoxical changes is closer linkages between traditional security issues and other issues . The artificial but convenient separation of the field into security and political economy may be one of the casualties of the struggle against terrorism . Areas formerly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transport , transnational finance , and migration , have become more important to security , and more tightly subject therefore to state regulation . <p> Finally , the globalization of informal violence indicates how parochial have been some of the disputes among various schools of international relations theory . Analysis of the ramifications of the attacks on the United States must come to grips not only with structures of power , but also with changing subjective ideas and their impact on strategies . It must be concerned with international institutions , and with non-state actors and networks -- elements of world politics emphasized by different schools of thought . And it must probe the connections between domestic politics and world politics . We do not face a choice between these perspectives , but rather the task of synthesizing them into a comprehensive , yet coherent , view . <p> Our understanding of world politics has often advanced under the pressure of events , such as those of World War II , the Nuclear Revolution , and the growth of economic interdependence over the last fifty years . Perhaps the globalization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ period of intellectual creativity , as sober thinking about global governance and classic political realism converge on problems identified so well by the " liberalism of fear .

" @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actor 's liability to suffer costs imposed by external events even after policies have been altered . This language seems inappropriate in the contemporary situation , since in ordinary language , the attacks on an unprepared United States on September 11 demonstrated how vulnerable the country was .

These overly optimistic portrayals minimize the pivotal value of effective teaching and are implicitly or explicitly coupled with political agendas that attempt to increasingly control and regiment the work of teachers . Through discussing student interest and issues of educational technology in urban schools and highlighting the affordances and limitations of the texts , tools , and talk that teachers might facilitate with these devices , the authors offer a teacher-focused perspective that is sorely missing in the contemporary debates about using mobile technologies in schools . <p> Title <p> The Importance of Still Teaching the iGeneration : New Technologies and the Centrality of Pedagogy

@@2741182 <h> The Immanent Frame <p> The last decade has witnessed a veritable scholarly obsession with the subject of political theology : a multifaceted concept with varying meanings ranging from theocracy studies to the origins of contemporary political ideas . The reasons behind the turn to political theology are complex , and current scholarly interest in the topic often varies depending on the academic discipline . Yet despite its numerous subfields , the current debate over political theology often hinges on one question : Can liberal democracies function and flourish on secular principles alone or must they make recourse to religious inspiration and language ? <p> Since 9/11 , some of the most noted contemporary philosophers and theorists " Charles Taylor , J++rgen Habermas , - Giorgio Agamben , and others " have seemingly devoted- the bulk of their academic energies- to this question . Many of them , often atheists , have highlighted the functional and structural importance of theology for political and- social life . Some suggest that Enlightenment reason alone is incapable of cultivating- the necessary virtues to sustain the democratic public sphere . Others argue , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Judeo-Christian heritage in order to- defend its superiority against irrational belief . <p> So we now have an- ironic situation in which theological discourse in the public sphere is tolerated by certain atheists in the academy " often on the political Left " who are unconvinced that secularism alone can engender and facilitate liberal/democratic cultures . Not only do their critics find this solution unacceptable , but they are also troubled by some of the intellectual influences used to support it . Their aim , in turn , is to overcome political theology by defending secularism 's ability to satisfy modern democratic needs . <p> It is this backstory that provides much of the motivational context for Victoria Kahn 's impressive new book , The Future of Illusion : Political Theology and Early Modern Texts . Kahn is one of the preeminent scholars associated with the- turn to political theology- in early modern studies , but her interest in political theology is diametrically opposed to the post-secular attempt to rehabilitate it . She , in fact , calls out Charles Taylor , Giorgio Agamben , Slavoj Zizek , Terry Eagleton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ political and cultural sufficiency of secularism . Kahn believes that such misguided pessimism is due to a crucial oversight . <p> The major aim of Kahn 's work is to tease out the theological and secular motifs of early modern texts , in order to demonstrate their reoccurrence in the present debate over political theology ; a path that she believes contemporary critics have neglected to their peril . In this way , Kahn argues that she can overcome the post-secular sympathy for theology by recovering a form of secularism that provides all the necessary resources for making political theology obsolete . <p> Kahn pursues this by providing an exegetical- account of how the most influential twentieth-century analysts of political theology " Carl Schmitt , Leo Strauss , Ernst Kantorowicz , Walter Benjamin " made recourse to the early modern period in developing their arguments on the origins of the theological-political problem. - These thinkers , suggests Kahn , - pinpointed the key term by which Hobbes , Shakespeare , Machiavelli and Spinoza broke away from legitimating the state on theological grounds : - the- idea of poiesis . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human creation on par with art or poetry .

@@2741187 <h> The Immanent Frame <p> The invention of " religions " in the modern discursive form is also the invention of the secular state and the modern idea of " science " as essentially different from " religion . " In any given context of modernity we are always dealing with " religion " in various binary oppositions , which are all dependent on the bottom-line distinction between religion and whatever is assumed to be non-religion , now referred to rhetorically as the secular . In discussions about religion , its separation from , and thus relation to , other discursive non-religious domains such as science , politics or economics is usually only acknowledged tacitly and in passing , if at all , conveying ( say ) an untroubled and unquestioned sense that religion and politics or religion and science or religion and economics are essentially distinct , and thus in danger of getting confused . <p> Tomoko Masuzawa is always an interesting writer and I would like to register my agreement with her when she says elsewhere on this website : <p> My suggestion is that we seriously consider @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one hand , and the discursive apparatus that has hitherto sustained our notion of religion , on the other , might be two essential body-parts of a single beast ; and that this may be why we can not tweak , upgrade , or discard the notion of " the secular " without questioning the other part . <p> This argument has been made by others ( for example , Talal Asad ) and also myself in several articles , published debates ( some of them related to Japan ) and three recent books . I discussed the mutually parasitic relationship between " religion " and other categories such as the secular state , " politics , " " society " and other secular discursive domains in a book called The Ideology of Religious Studies , where I argued that : <p> the category religion is at the heart of modern western capitalist ideology and it mystifies by playing a crucial role in the construction of the secular , which to us represents the self-evidently true realm of scientific factuality , rationality and naturalness . <p> It was the theme @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 2003 called " Religion and the Secular : Historical and Colonial Contexts .

In 2007 I also published another monograph developing this view in considerable historical detail , entitled Discourse on Civility and Barbarity . What I believe Masuzawas insight entails , methodologically , is that discourses on " religion , " which operate on the assumption that it is a stand-alone category with its own distinctive referent , are at base conceptually flawed ( hence the central problem with her in other respects fascinating book , The Invention of World Religions ) . <p> My argument is that " religion " is not a stand-alone category with its own distinctive referent but is unintelligible without simultaneous cognizance of those practices which in any strategic context get put in the category " non-religion , " which is the bottom-line meaning of " secular " in modern rhetoric .

This may explain why Europhone people all seem to know , or rather assume they know , instinctively what the meaning of religion is .

Whereas the singularity and universality of Christianity encompassed the church-state and authorized its own science and its own " political " practices , today to be Christian is to practice a personal and essentially private right licensed by the non-religious nation state . <p> In actual cases it is an opposition which is asserted energetically , as when for example the Archbishop of Canterbury is scolded by the media for making statements which are too " political . " Or when a Mullah is described as being really a political leader using religion to forward his political agenda , as though " religion " and " politics " can stand in for one another only under camouflage . The religion-secular binary usually takes specific forms of separation and mutually-displacing opposition , such as religion versus politics , or religion as distinct from the state , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against secular education/law etc . As I have shown in considerable detail in my own work , none of these terms has any essential meaning , they are constantly subverted in a range of practices in all societies where the distinction is part of the dominant ideology , and yet the boundaries between them , and the contested places where they ought or ought not to be distinguished , are defended passionately . <p> These rhetorically-constructed distinctions between the religious and what falls outside religion ( which logically must be non-religion , or domains and practices which are deemed to be non-religious ) are supported by other problematic binaries such as natural and supernatural , inner and outer , spiritual and material , soul and body , private and public , metaphysical and empirical , faith and knowledge , and arguably female and male . All of these binaries , taken on their own , one by one , are inherently problematic , but they operate in circular fashion to keep the semantic chain rolling . Each binary displaces the other in a continual displacement of meaning . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ radically since the 17th century in line with other profound shifts in our constructions of the world ; yet they are taken not only in religious studies but throughout the academy and in popular discourse as eternal verities , as though the claimed essential distinction between religious practices such as tea ceremony or sung evensong and non-religious practices such as giving a dinner party or performing an opera is part of the natural order . <p> Why is it so important to impose this ideological division universally ? And in what sense has it been taken universally , either in the UK or in Japan ? <p> I would like therefore to take issue with Morris Augustine , who responded to Tomoko Masuzawa earlier . I respect his knowledge of Japan and note he has lived there for 35 years . My own stay in Japan was only 13 years , though I return every year . But the problem lies in knowing what is meant in both English and Japanese by the key terms used . When Japanese people tell Morris Augustine that they are very happy with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what is being separated from what ? I have had disagreements with learned colleagues about the problem of describing and analyzing " religion " uncritically in the Japanese context , and one of these debates is available on the internet ( However , I may have been over-generous regarding the theoretical sensitivity of anthropologists in this arena , for anthropology is also a contributory agency for recycling " religion " discourse . I also find problems with the attribution of " religion " to the UK , so I deny that this is an orientalist projection . ) . <p> For one thing it should be noted that the Japanese male literate elite were aware in the 1860s or 70s that they were deemed a semi-barbarous nation ( rather than outright savage , based on the classification of societies or nations used widely in the 19th century by anthropologists such as E.B. Tylor , lawyers , missionaries and generally ) , and that if they wanted to achieve the degree of civility of the advanced countries such as the US , Britain or France one of their tasks was to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and voluntary right from the secular state as the hallmark of a modern Nation . This gave rise to a debate among the Japanese elite about which word should be used for " religion , " since it was not self-evident what religion meant to the Japanese in their own terms . This was not because there was anything lacking in the Japanese language or way of life , which was undoubtedly every bit as sophisticated and rich as that of Euro-America . It was just that Japan was different , just as most colonized polities , or those threatened with colonization , were different in significant respects from each other and from Europe . <p> Anybody who has lived and worked in Japan , as Morris has , will agree that many things today which have been adopted by Japanese institutions as a result of what many Japanese people describe as outside pressure ( gaiatsu ) have been transformed and operate in significantly different ways in Japan , including capitalism , democracy and the exercise of power . For most Japanese people at the time of the opening of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meant Christianity , and that was foreign to Japan . It smelled foreign ( stink = kusai ) like butter . At first it seems that in the Meiji Constitution of 1889 and the Imperial Rescript on Education ( 1890 ) the newly invented state Shinto was classified as national morality and in structural terms took the equivalent place where the " secular nation state " stood , in the sense that , whereas " religions " were now to be identified and classified as private voluntary organizations , national morality and complete obedience to the Emperor was a public duty . This ideology was called Kokka Shinto , or State Shinto . In short , the Japanese had to invent " religions " and also what they understood in Japanese translation by a modern secular nation state , Kokka Shinto , simultaneously . <p> Of course the imported terms of the religion-secular distinction , and , crucially , their translation into Japanese language , have become institutionalized in Japan , not only in the US written Constitution of 1946 but also in government policy , academia and the media @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Japanese life , many significant everyday practices , which look like ritual , which is one of the strongest contenders for a definition of religion . What I think this aspect of everyday life shows us is that human practices do not fall easily into two great baskets , the religious and the secular , the religious and the non-religious . <p> Yet the same is true of modern Britain . Whether we are talking about Japan , Britain or any other nation , does it for example make sense to ask if nationalism , patriotism , and the rituals of the national flag , are religious or secular ? Is the Nation State ( which nobody has ever seen ) not a transcendental entity which receives regular ritual veneration from all branches of the establishment , live sacrifices in our war heroes , and arguably a form of worship by the whole nation at the Cenotaph in Whitehall in London ? Is there an essential difference , as in the difference between a religious act and a non-religious act , between dying for ones country and dying for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ English to say that " the opera singer is devoted to her art and worships Mozart , " nor would it be unnatural to add " she religiously practices the scales everyday . " Why should such perfectly current English be seen as merely metaphorical speech ? On what grounds ? What is it a metaphor for ? In the case of Japan , the " religions " called Shinto or Confucianism are ( I would suggest ) modern reifications which are more intelligible as deeply embedded elements in everyday Japanese practice , cultivated in the schools , universities , and corporations , practices which constitute a profound conception of human relations , deeply affect pedagogy and domestic life , and reproduced in all institutions , a rich plethora of ways of behaving and expressing values that cuts across the religion-secular dichotomy and show us that we do not need this category except as a problem that needs analyzing . When I asked my Japanese students , as I often did in both English and Japanese , if they were interested in religion , a typical reply was that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed associated with Christianity for them . What about visiting the shrine ( jinja ) or the temple ( o-tera ) , or participating in a festival ( o-matsuri ) , all of which form part of the construction of the " religious world of the Japanese " in many text books ? Typically the answer would be that that is n't religion , that 's Japanese traditional custom . What constitutes religious behaviour as distinct from secular custom and tradition seems arbitrary and not self-evident . <p> When is etiquette closer to secular or religious practice ? Or is this distinction completely useless for understanding etiquette , since arguably it is both and therefore neither ? Is the tea ceremony a religious ritual ( as was argued in an anthropological journal , the JRAI ) or a non-religious ritual ? One point I would like to make here is that different Japanese people in different contexts ( like all different humans in all different contexts ) will say different things , depending on their education , relative degree of seniority , language being used , and what they think you want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does , that " the Japanese people love their Constitution , including its separation of the government from religion and its guarantee of freedom from religion " is not untrue but is a big generalization and begs many questions about what is being asserted and loved , and what is being separated from what . Many Japanese , like many British and US citizens , would probably be prepared to die for their ancestors and their nation . Is patriotism a religious or a non-religious emotion ? Is the wonderful attention to detail in the giving and receiving of gifts in Japan a religious ritual or a secular , economic exchange ? One could extend the examples in many directions , for Japan , UK , USA , India and many other collective representations , including , for example , the elaborate rituals performed within the " secular " Houses of Parliament in London , or the extended rituals surrounding the election of a new President of the USA . <p> What I have tried to do here is suggest the inherently parasitic relationship between whatever is deemed to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and which is imagined to come into some kind of external , contingent relation with religion . As Masuzawa rightly suggests , both parts of this " single beast " need to be handled at the same time , so that its complete shape comes into view . Only then can we understand the power of " religion " as a rhetorical construction to mystify us , and its ideological structure and uses . <p> This entry was posted on Wednesday , October 29th , 2008 at 10:09 am and <h> 2 Responses to " Religion is not a standalone category " <p> Thank you for your thoughtful comments on my own comments on Tomoko Masuzawas notions of " religion " and the secular in Japan . The fact is that I largely agree with what Timothy says , and his description of what his Japanese students said about not being religious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same question . I think our differences stem from rather starkly different notions of the academic ( not the typical Japanese student or professors ) definition of what what religion actually is . I see religion as being more or less what anthropologists like Clifford Geertz or sociologists like Robert N. Bellah see it to be . Of course religion and the secular and the scientific merge together in every culture . But the above authorities make a very clear distinction between a cultural system of religion ( an element that by definition reaches beyond the natural and the rational and is by definition a TRANSCENDENT element which depends on religious faith as its ground . In this sense religion is but one of many separate cultural systems ; others are the political , the financial , the literary , the military and many others . Some of these are by their very nature based on a system of symbolssuch as poetry , painting and religion . <p> Of course , all of these elements blend together in every culture , so that whether an oath or putting up a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or simply a family or Japanese custom must depend on what the person who does such things thinks he or she is doing . But there is no question in Geertz or Bellahs or my own mind that they are religious acts because they aim at the transcendent belief or lack of belief that the spirits of ones ancestors really do still exist in a transcendent dimension . It is not surprising to me that Japanese students and/or professors never really think about what they are doing when they ( almost everyone in one way or another ) give some sort of honor to the spirits of their deceased grandfathers . The Japanese word for " religion , " " shukyo " may be and usually is considered to refer to religious systems other than their own ; this is a typical example of the " nihonjinron " or conscious or unconscious feeling that their own race and culture is in a class by itself and can not simply be compared to others . So their transcendent beliefs may not be called " religious , " but in fact they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I find Japanese people to be very religious people . I have never found a Japanese who does not think that their deceased immediate relatives do not transcendentally continue to existand that is only one example of their religiosity . <p> Contemporary religiosity is different all over the world and is changing rapidly , as Charles Taylor in his Templeton Prize and Kyoto Prize winning book A Secular Age demonstrates in great detail . We know our cosmos and all of our natural reality in a vastly different manner that people in the time of Christ of Mohamed saw it . We know about galaxies and sub-atomic mysteries that explain things like lightning , thunder , death , and fecundity in vastly different ways . That simply means that our religious faith has to keep pace with our natural knowledge . It does not mean that either Japanese or others do not still belief in a transcendent Ultimate Ground or Principle that is worthy of our profound reverence . <p> The word " transcendent " is not a sufficient apology for the study of religion as a category . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ realize that transcendence is theologically defined .

The paper argues that these reasons can be integrated into a more comprehensive account of the companys failure through the introduction of a modified version of principal-agent theory . Instead of focusing on abstract , dyadic relationships , the paper proposes a model that accounts for the meaningful character of principal agent interactions and for the complex networks and multiple role identities of actors within those networks that comprised principal-agent relations within the company . On the basis of this model the failure of the company can be seen as a result of contradictions between its dual role as both agent and principal .

@@2741200 <h> J. S. Mill 's Feminism and the Third Dimension of Power <p> Are John Stuart Mill 's feminist ideas espoused in The Subjection of Women very liberal , or very radical ? This question has been debated among contemporary scholars . The purpose of this paper is two fold . The first goal is to propose that Mill 's feminist work reveals a conception of power that is analogous to Steven Lukes 's ( 2005 ) radical theory of power . This is demonstrated by using Lukes 's theory as a lens through which to systematically analyze Mill 's conception of power as seen in The Subjection of Women . Second , I suggest that from an understanding of Mill 's conception of power as radical in the way that Lukes defines it , four central feminist critiques of Mill 's Subjection of Women are mitigated . Understanding Mill 's feminism in light of a radical view of power reveals that some feminist critiques have overlooked important aspects of Mill 's feminism that show his continued relevancy to the contemporary feminist movement and feminist thought .

@@2741223 <p> Many Americans are deeply troubled by the often tepid reactions from the Muslim world to the September 11 attacks and by the images of street protests in Muslim countries against U. S. military actions in Afghanistan . These reactions have led to a spate of stories in the popular press and television asking , " Why do they hate us ? " and for some they signal the existence of a clearly defined enemy who , by not signaling that they were with us , must be against us . Is n't this the clash of civilizations that Harvard political scientist Samuel Huntington described almost a decade ago pitting Islam against the west ? <p> As a political psychologist I have been particularly interested in how people make sense of complex , emotionally powerful events and why different , seemingly contradictory , accounts of what seems to be the same event co-exist . These different accounts , often referred to as narratives , matter for at least three different reasons that I explore in this short article . First , a narrative 's metaphors and images can tell us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ social and political worlds in which they live . Second , they can reveal deep fears , perceived threats , and past grievances that drive a conflict . Third , narratives are important because they sanction certain kinds of action and not others . For example , defining the September 11 attacks as an act of war provided support for different kinds of responses than defining them as a criminal act would have done . By focusing on narratives I am not dismissing the importance of the structural features of the contemporary international system or of the competing interests of different actors . Rather , they are not my focus in this short article . <p> First let me say something about what a psychocultural narrative is and how this concept can help us understand and manage conflict . Narratives are explanations for events ( large and small ) in the form of short , common sense accounts ( stories ) that often seem simple . However , the powerful images they contain and the judgments they make about the motivations and actions of their own group , and others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are not always internally consistent . For example , they often alternate between portraying one 's own group , as well as an opponent , as strong and portraying them as vulnerable . Narratives meet a number of different needs people have . They are especially relevant in times of high uncertainty and high stress . Just at the moments when people are most disoriented , such as the period following September 11 , we struggle to make sense of events , and shared narratives which are reinforced within groups help people find reassurance and to cope with high anxiety . Groups with divergent beliefs and experiences construct different narratives of the same event . However , it is crucial to understand that narratives are not made from whole cloth but are grounded in selectively remembered and interpreted experiences and projections from them . Finally it is important to understand that all cultural traditions have access to multiple pre-existing narratives that provide support for diverse actions in times of stress , as we can see in the many varied citations from the Koran and the Bible to justify responses to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and anxiety produce pressures towards conformity once a narrative emerges , although as new events unfold there can be questioning and conflict around , and change in , a narrative .

In short , we can understand agreement on narratives as public opinion formation that is both an effort by individuals to reduce uncertainty and the stress accompanying it , and by leaders to mobilize public support . <p> Deep threats to identity are among the strongest feelings people have in bitter conflicts . Usually these involve perceived denigration and humiliation . In violent conflicts , the fears also include concern for physical security and fears of extinction of self , family , and the group and its culture , including its sacred icons and sites .

It is perhaps a new kind of war , but a war nonetheless and the only response to being attacked is to attack back both to punish those responsible for the carnage and to prevent future attacks .

Where the first emphasizes the reassurance a strong , military response can offer , the second expresses fears that this strong response will quickly become a vengeful attack on a vulnerable religious community . Whereas the first invokes images of justice , the second predicts uncontrolled revenge and more of the injustice that has long characterized the relationship between the west and Islam . It asks , if Americans claim that justice is so important , why have Palestinians been neglected for so long and subjected to frequent attacks using American-made sophisticated weapons ? Why are Iraqi children unable to meet their basic nutritional needs while its leaders literally live in palaces ? In short , the second narrative expresses the deepest vulnerabilities , humiliation , rage at both the west and the leaders of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second narrative is connected to the anger and resentment against the US in many parts of the Islamic world , but it does n't mean that all Muslims agree with it or hate the US . The power of the narrative is its plausibility , meaning that it resonates with how many Muslims understand historical conflicts with the Christian world as well as more recent events in their own lifetimes . At least four events are especially relevant here : ( 1 ) American support for the Shah of Iran and complete opposition to the Iranian revolution ; ( 2 ) unconditional support for Israel despite their refusal to take significant steps towards the achievement of a Palestinian state ; ( 3 ) the Gulf War , which was justified in the west in terms of turning back Iraqi aggression but which was widely understood by Muslims as propping up autocratic , unpopular and corrupt regimes upon whom American oil supplies depended ; and ( 4 ) threats to Islamic holy sites in Saudi Arabia and Jerusalem resulting from not only American presence in the region but the more diffuse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A psychocultural analysis points towards the deep fears and humiliations these events have unleashed and links them to parallel past experiences . <p> One could view the two narratives as support for the view that the world can be neatly dichotomized into two groups " those who are for us and those who are against us and that therefore further explosive and escalating conflict is inevitable . It is further possible to attribute the attitudes and behaviors of those involved solely to their culture and religion . However , to do so would be a serious oversimplification with policy implications whose consequences are likely to exacerbate , rather than ease , future problems . Instead , the complexity and ambiguity of the narratives themselves , as well as the experiences underlying them , have significant implications for future American policy in the region and for thinking about bridging what seem like two completely incompatible worldviews . <p> There are times when conditions move a group to apparent unity , but many others where internal differences are highly significant . Often our language implies that opposing parties are unified , while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we should recognize the considerable diversity within each side . Many Americans are struggling to articulate a narrative that recognizes the horrific inexcusable nature of the attacks , the injustices of previous western actions against Islamic peoples , and the risks of defining the situation as war . Similarly , many Muslims are puzzling about how to balance their disgust at the attacks with their equally strong rejection of American policies which support corrupt , authoritarian regimes in the region , and their opposition to high-tech military action which threatens Muslim civilian populations . Also worth noting is that the two narratives described above have some important points of agreement and other areas where there are differences of focus ( the recent attacks versus past injustices ) but not necessarily explicit disagreements . Recognizing this complexity , as well as the diversity of opinions and complexity of feelings within each side , is a first step in finding ways to emphasize common concerns or to articulate areas of possible congruence . <p> By revealing emotional " hot spots , " narratives not only promote understanding of the deeper roots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strategic intervention and identify barriers to change . Narratives can change but not necessarily when they are directly confronted . Simply telling people their story of events is wrong is rarely successful because there is often great emotional attachment to an account that is defended from such frontal assaults . It is the images and organization of most narratives that explains their power , not the facts in them . <p> A psychocultural change strategy requires the introduction of new experiences and/or the introduction of new emotional connections that alter the salience of elements in the narrative of key actors in a conflict and invite new and/or revised linkages among their key elements . This understanding of narratives has significant implications for future American policy towards the Muslim world in general and the Arab world in particular . Let me suggest the following constructive steps that follow from this analysis . These suggestions are based on the hypothesis that narratives are produced interactively and that change in how one group experiences an opponent alters their own narratives and subsequent behavior . <p> Better listening and learning . The US needs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rage , directed towards it from parts of the Muslim world . It is easy to point the finger at demagogic figures , such as Saddam Hussein , Osama bin Laden or the Taliban , but the question should focus not just on the hate and propaganda they are distributing but also on why their audience seems so receptive . It is far easier to understand the motives of sellers than buyers . However , it is necessary to understand the deeply rooted vulnerabilities , fears , and humiliations so many Muslims feel towards the west in general and the US in particular and to recognize the importance of past experiences and perceptions in current reactions.Acknowledgment . There is a long and bitter history of relations between the Christian and Muslim worlds , and the Muslims still have vivid , bitter cultural memories of the massacres and desecration of their holy sites during the Crusades , the expulsions from Spain and Portugal in the late 15th century , and European colonization in the 19th and 20th centuries . Pope John Paul II 's visit to a mosque in Damascus in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a small effort to acknowledge this past . It might easily be contrasted with President Bush 's reference to the war against terrorism as a Crusade in the first days after September 11 . Acknowledgment can be both verbal and symbolic . It involves empathy without necessarily communicating apology or agreement . What are acknowledged are the deep feelings and threats a group feels . This can be painful for all sides but it can result in a lowered intensity of feelings or even , when accompanied by meaningful actions , a rearrangement of connection among elements in a narrative.New policies , actions and labels . The US administration has worked hard to define its response as an attack on terrorists and their supporters , not one against the Muslim world . It is not yet clear how successful this definition has been in countries such as Pakistan , Egypt , Saudi Arabia or Iran given the deep distrust of the US . Actions are needed which communicate this message more fully . It is also important that the US make a major effort towards a just settlement of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both is ineffective in achieving its key goals , and also puts the US in a completely untenable humanitarian position . Probably the most difficult challenge will be to stop turning a blind eye to oppressive , corrupt regimes just because they happen to be aligned with the US or supply needed resources . Making social justice and democratization in the region a high priority is long overdue and the US has to recognize that some of the strongest voices for democratization and egalitarian development are sometimes Islamist . If the US continues to support regimes throughout the region which suppress all dissent , especially when it speaks with an Islamic voice , the US will continue to be the target of increased anger that arises from hopelessness and gives rise to extremist and terrorist groups . <p> When asked at a press conference on October 11 , 2001 why people in the Muslim world hate the US , George Bush expressed amazement and replied , " That 's because they do n't know us . " Some might respond that " they know us all too well . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knowing an opponent can sometimes improve a relationship ; rather it draws attention to the role that structural relationships , specific policies , and deep emotions play in complicated , deep conflicts . In no way is it a justification for the horrible acts perpetrated on innocent people on September 11 ; my effort at explanation is aimed at understanding some of the underlying dynamics at work to make such future actions less likely . The US military action may well achieve a number of its immediate goals . However , only when the deepest fears of each side are both understood and addressed , and the narratives of all parties become more complex and nuanced , will events such as September 11 become less likely . Where the clash of civilizations argument ( offered by both Huntington and bin Laden ) presents the conflict between Islam and the west as inevitable and enduring , the perspective here suggests that despite the deeply rooted historical nature of this conflict , there is much that can be done in the coming years to transform the conflict in more constructive directions and to lower its salience and intensity .

Traversing the complex political landscape of early modern European empires , this book locates the historical origins of modern global humanitarianism in the recurrent conflict over the ethical treatment of non-Europeans that pitted religious reformers against secular imperial networks . Since the sixteenth-century beginnings of European expansion overseas and in marked opposition to the exploitative logic of predatory imperialism , these reformers - members of Catholic orders and , later , Quakers and other reformist Protestants - developed an ideology and a political practice in defense of the rights and interests of distant " others .

A distinctive institutional model of long-distance advocacy crystallized out of these persistent struggles , becoming the standard weapon of transnational activists .

In particular , I analyze two dominant , mutually constitutive sets of sexual scripts participants invoked in their bottom narratives : first , that bottoms are men who desire to produce pleasure for their partners ; and second , that bottoms are men who desire to submit sexually to their partners . I argue that these scripted conceptions both give possibility to and constrain the ways in which participants interpret and experience their sexual practices and desires . I conclude by examining how these scripts operate as structurated social phenomena that shape the ways in which participants are able to navigate scenarios in which these scripts conflict directly with safer sex scripts , potentially resulting in what I term pleasure/risk dilemmas .

Kabotie painted images of ceremonial dances alongside Pueblo peers in Santa Fe in the 1910s , at the height of federal assimilation policies . American patrons supported the painters as a means of constructing an indigenous artistic identity for the nation . But the display of Pueblo paintings in Venice marked the limits of aesthetic nationalism , failing to convince overseas audiences that America possessed an artistic treasury older and more authentic than that of Europe . The author recovers Kaboties broader engagement with issues of displacement , memory , and embodiment . She proposes that the paintings share a visual logic with musical notation and other diagrams , transmitting the sensibility of Hopi dances across gaps in time and space . They resonate with the politics of memory in recent work by Native artists at the Venice Biennale.

He is the author of Natural Disasters ( 1993 ) , Confronting Catastrophe ( 2000 ) and Principles of Emergency Planning and Management ( 2002 ) . <h> Introduction <p> In the 1960s some valuable sociological research was carried out on the plight of black people in US disasters ( Anderson 1970a ) and also on the role of the military in such events ( Anderson 1969 , 1970b ) . Although these topics have not been totally neglected since then , they have tended to lapse in social scientists ' agendas ( cf. Wright 1997 ) . Now the disaster in New Orleans has thrown them once again into high relief . <p> To begin with , Hurricane Katrina quickly became a " class-quake " with divisions arranged along lines of social status and ethnic origin ( Blaikie et al . 1994 p. 6 , Fothergill et al @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relief activities into increasingly strenuous attempts to restore law and order was strikingly anomalous with respect to other disasters elsewhere ( Johnson 1987 ) . <p> Two conceptual models can be applied in order to understand this situation . The first , a symbolic model developed from popular culture , can only be utilised in a negative sense . The second is an evolutionary model that analyses disaster response in terms of the global development of civil protection . <h> First model : disaster as spectacle <p> The " Hollywood " conception of disaster is one in which a destructive event leads to the spontaneous breakdown of the social order ( Couch 2000 ) . People 's true natures are revealed , and violent and egotistical traits are the dominant ones . In the descent into anarchy people are divided into heroes and villains . Among the heroes , a leader spontaneously emerges , more by natural selection than any form of training or preparation , and law , order and calm are restored using drastic means to suppress the villains and stop the anarchy ( Mitchell et al . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as one might call it , may be ridiculously simplistic but it is endlessly repeated in popular entertainment . Surprisingly , few attempts have been made to assess the extent to which it conditions the views on disaster held by ordinary people . It is certainly often at the back of journalists ' portrayals of disastrous events . One wonders whether it has begun to assume the status of a self-fulfilling prophecy , such that in disaster people conform to it because that is what they are familiar with from television , radio and the print media ( Bahk and Neuwirth 2000 ) . <h> Second model : disaster as a problem of civil protection <p> The second conceptual model charts the progress of emergency preparedness in recent times . Modern civil protection1 emerged gradually from its progenitor civil defence during the period since 1970 ( Drabek 1991 ) . Various basic principles have been established , including the following : <p> Military forces are not the best source of civilian disaster management . Their organisation , rationale and command structures are not fully appropriate to the management of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ military should be the forces of last resort , and disasters should normally be managed by civilian organisations that are both more accountable and more sensitive to civilians ' needs ( Wright 1997 ) . <p> Good disaster preparedness is a collective effort that requires a system of organisation and administration which is integrated vertically from local to national levels and horizontally among neighbouring jurisdictions ( Trim 2004 ) . <p> The gradual evolution of civil protection requires members of the public to assume progressively more responsibility for their own safety and security . This does not mean abandoning them to their own devices , but ensuring that they understand the risks of disaster that they run and have the means to face up to them . Traditional , indigenous and social coping mechanisms need to be reinforced wherever appropriate ( Kirschenbaum 2004 ) . <p> Civil defence is a progenitor of civil protection . In an epoch of global terrorism the two must co-exist . The maintenance or restoration of law and order may be fundamental to civil defence , but civil protection is based on the encouragement of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dynes and Quarantelli 1997 ) . <p> A further important principle to take into account when analysing disaster situations is that what transpires will be a function of both the event itself and the pre-existing conditions , including : <p> the level of preparedness of government agencies , non-governmental organisations and the general public ; <p> the quality ( if not the presence or absence ) of emergency planning at the institutional and community levels ; <p> the degree of homogeneity or division in society , including the level of equality or inequality . <h> Hurricane Katrina : a preliminary analysis <p> These two models represent diametric opposites . Where is the Hurricane Katrina disaster in this spectrum ? <p> New Orleans is a vibrant and creative place but one in which poverty and deprivation afflict the inner city . Gang warfare and a flourishing market in illicit drugs have contributed to a murder rate that is ten times the national average . Some 120,000 residents lack cars and 80 percent of the inner city is floodable , to depths that in places exceed three metres . The year before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of evacuating the coastal towns and cities of the Gulf of Mexico . Scenario-builders had predicted in detail what would occur ( Laska 2004 , Nolan 2005 ) . Lack of revenue and other resources , lack of political will , free-market ideology , lack of environmental protection , destruction of wetlands and excessive reliance on fallible structural protection are all factors that conspired to make the eventual " and inevitable " disaster what it was . Citizens of New Orleans had been warned that help would be inadequate , especially regarding evacuation . Yet they were not given any alternatives on which to build a strategy of resilience . <p> Apart from a notable absence of individual , emergent " heroes " , the " Hollywood " model seemed to fit quite well to the mayhem that occurred in the wake of Katrina . Yet the reality on the ground defied such a glib analysis . In post-Katrina New Orleans it was impossible to gauge the real significance of sniping , rape , murder and looting ( the last of these a myth in many other disasters ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the claims of witnesses in the field who are overwhelmed by what they experience ( Ploughman 1995 ) . The mass media tend to dramatise events to the extent that damage becomes " devastation " and a shot fired becomes " shootings " , or even " urban warfare " . Moreover , some looters were people who strove to find basic supplies for themselves and others who were left behind in the city . <p> Whether or not the anarchy and violence should be played down , there is no doubt that the situation was without a precedent among recent natural disasters . As both commentators and participants have remarked , it resembled post-invasion Baghdad rather than a US metropolitan area ( Tracisk 2005 ) . <p> In disaster situations , epidemics are rare and diseases are usually only a threat if they are already endemic in the afflicted area ( De Ville de Goyet 1999 ) . The same is true of social diseases , and in this respect disaster opens an extraordinarily revealing window on the inner workings of society . <p> Images of heavily armed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bring to mind the extraordinarily ham-fisted response to the San Francisco earthquake of 1906 , when people were spontaneously shot dead as looters while foraging in the wreckage of their own homes ( Hansen and Condon 1989 ) . I know of no other case of short-term , post-disaster evacuation in which evacuees had to be sought by police , soldiers and dogs and taken away in handcuffs . It is axiomatic and well-known in the emergency management community that compulsory evacuation orders are impossible to enforce : attempts to impose them are as time-consuming as they are futile ( Perry 1994 ) . Yet it is less appropriate to criticise the instantaneous response than the lack of foresight and preparation that might have made draconian measures unnecessary . <p> Whatever the resonance " or lack of it " of the " Hollywood " model , the ' civil-defence-civil protection ' model leads to some interesting and pertinent observations on what happened in New Orleans . Seen from the perspective of an outsider , the initial response to the disaster was more characteristic of civil defence than of civil protection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when civilian disasters were tackled in a paramilitary way under the assumption that the principal problem was how to restore law and order , rather than how to restore health , safety and dignity to the affected population ( Alexander 2002 ) . <p> Since the terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001 some influential commentators have argued that US disaster response has taken a step backwards ( Mitchell 2003 ) . Paradoxically , the renewed emphasis on preparedness seems to have weakened the Federal capability . Under President Clinton and James Lee Witt , FEMA made disaster prevention the central rationale of its approach . In reality , despite the desire to make the reorientation from response to events prior to prevention of their consequences , such was the press of disasters in the USA of the 1990s that two-thirds of FEMA 's budget nevertheless went on post-disaster emergency efforts ( National Journal 1993 ) . However , when FEMA was subsumed into the Department of Homeland Security its budget was severely cut and the revenue diverted to preparing to respond to terrorist outrages . As there is an infinity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such events are very expensive to prepare for , as well as being for the most part hypothetical ( Bailey 1996 ) . <p> With these reflections in mind , and with the benefit of hindsight , it is easy to point the finger of accusation at the US Federal Government ( Dynes 1991 ) , but it is not exactly fair to do so . In a federal republic one can not expect federal institutions to override state and local ones unless the national interest is very directly threatened , and then only as far as the threat should be countered . FEMA 's key role used to be one of encouraging the states and cities ( their SEMAs and LEMAs , state and local emergency management agencies ) to prepare for disaster . The reduction of that role may have been a crucial factor in the failure of initial responses to Hurricane Katrina , rather more than the failure of federal institutions to respond adequately . <p> The US National Weather Service is famous for its ability to forecast hurricane activity and paths ( Sheets and Williams 2001 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( such as death of 23,000 people in the eruption of the Colombian volcano Nevado del Ru+z in 1985 ) in which prediction and warning became disengaged ( Voight 1990 ) . Warning systems involve technological-scientific , administrative and social components ( Lindell and Perry 1987 ) . The heart of the failure in New Orleans lay in the evaluation and translation of scientific information into public action . Moreover , the inefficiency of evacuation from New Orleans during Hurricane Ivan in September 2004 should have furnished some clear lessons , for example regarding the staffing and extension of contra-flow evacuation of vehicles on freeways and the organisation of an efficient public transit evacuation system ( Laska 2004 , Wolshon 2001 ) . Instead , it seems that the well-known " gambler 's fallacy " prevailed ( Burton and Kates 1964 ) : Ivan was a near-miss hurricane , that may have implied that New Orleans had already had its quota of major threats for the time being . <h> Conclusion <p> In 1972 Sims and Baumann published an article in Science magazine which suggested that responses to similar tornado @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United States . Southerners , they opined , were more fatalistic and less practical than northerners and hence less prepared for the damage , destruction and casualties . Since then , few other articles have tackled this theme , perhaps because culture is extraordinarily difficult to analyse , and perhaps because Sim 's and Baumann 's conclusions had overtones of cultural determinism . <p> This is a field in which there are no absolutes . Shortage of resources need not deter a community from organising itself ( Buckle et al . 2003 ) . Poverty need not be synonymous with vulnerability and incapacity ( Alam 2005 ) . Good things can come out of adversity . One striking aspect of the intellectual response to Hurricane Katrina is that left- and right-wing commentators have sought diametrically opposite moral conclusions from the same evidence ( e.g. Tracinsk 2005 , Wisner 2005 ) . Either excessive reliance on welfare has weakened the underclass in New Orleans or the same has resulted from lack of welfare . At the time of writing this , barely two weeks after the hurricane , it is impossible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what extent they will be taken on board . However , it is clear that substantial lessons are there to be learned at the federal , state and local level , and regarding environmental protection , early warning , evacuation , emergency planning and reconstruction .

Seldom has there been such a good opportunity for this to occur as in the wake of Hurricane Katrina , and so we must hope that the proposals that emerge are intelligent , practical , far-sighted and broadly acceptable . <h> Endnotes <p> 1 The term ' civil protection ' is widely used around the world to denote emergency planning and management activities , in part because it translates easily from English into some of the major languages ( Horlick-Jones et al . 1995 ) .

This study examines the association of age and other sociodemographic variables with properties of personal networks ; using samples of individuals residing in the rural western United States and the City of Los Angeles , we evaluate the degree to which these associations vary with geographical context . For both samples , we test the hypothesis that age is negatively associated with network size ( i.e. , degree ) and positively associated with network multiplexity ( the extent of overlap ) on 6 different relations : core discussion members , social activity participants , emergency contacts , neighborhood safety contacts , job informants , and kin . We also examine the relationship between age and spatial proximity to alters . <p> Method . Our data consist of a large-scale , spatially stratified egocentric network survey containing information about respondents and those to whom they are tied .

Although personal network size ultimately declines with age , we find that increases for some relations extend well into late-midlife and most elders still maintain numerous contacts across diverse relations .

@@2741300 <p> In imagining Iraq , we might want to start by remembering what Iraq was like thirteen years ago , and how unimaginable its present condition would have been . It would have been unimaginable not just because Iraq 's relation to the US has changed so dramatically , but because no one imagined that economic sanctions could look the way they do now . <p> The economic strangulation of a city or country has long been a part of warfare , either as an appurtenance to warfare or more directly in the form of a siege . But " economic sanctions " suggest something different in both intent and scope . Economic sanctions are generally understood to be driven by political or legal aims , such as punishment , deterrence , or pressure , intended to change the conduct of the target state . They are also distinguished from tariffs or limited retaliatory measures that occur as part of an ongoing trade relation , which are not intended to have broader political significance . <p> Siege warfare--the military blockade of a city or country to prevent goods from going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problems from an ethical perspective . The principle of discrimination in Just War doctrine , and in international law , holds that in warfare the belligerents are required to discriminate between combatants and noncombatants , and may not target civilians . Yet siege warfare has precisely the opposite effect : when you cut off a city 's access to food or water , those who are least able to survive the deprivation are children and infants , the elderly , the sick . At the same time , the state is likely to prioritize security , and shift resources to the military and to the political and military leadership , worsening the situation of civilians . So in siege warfare , the principle of discrimination is effectively inverted : not only is there no special protection for the civilian population , but that is precisely the population that will bear the worst costs , and within the general civilian population , those who suffer first , and worst , are those least responsible for the state 's decisions--children and infants , the elderly , the sick . <p> Throughout most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to siege warfare , at least not in practice . They also had a central role in emerging forms of international governance , offering an attractive alternative to the violence of warfare . After World War I , under Article 1 of the Pact of Paris ( the Kellogg-Briand Pact ) , the 63 signatory nations agreed to " condemn recourse to war for the solution of international controversies , and renounce it as an instrument of national policy . " Article 2 provided that all disputes shall be settled by " pacific means . " There was a sense that warfare itself was on the verge of becoming obsolete : <p> We are living at a turning point in history . This era which has witnessed a world war is also witnessing the beginning of a still greater historical event--a movement to rid the world of war as a political instrument and to make aggressive conflict between civilized nations an international crime.1 <p> Economic sanctions were intended to be the non-violent device by which the League of Nations would prevent aggression and enforce peace and order in the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peaceful coercion of the boycott . <p> Economic sanctions of this sort are not " war " in any sense of the term--nor would they lead to war . Such measures could no more be construed by an offending nation as hostile acts than could an individual lawbreaker look upon arrest as a personal insult to himself.2 <p> Economic sanctions were initially justified under international law simply as one of the measures incident to war . Drafts of the Covenant of the League of Nations held that , in the event that one state initiated war , all other states would automatically join the defending state in using all measures generally available in war , whether military or economic.3 However , in the post-World War I diplomatic climate , economic sanctions were re-framed in terms of inconvenience and embarrassment--as an option that presented no ethical difficulties , especially by comparison to war . <p> The economic weapon , conceived not as an instrument of war but as a means of peaceful pressure , is the great discovery and the most precious possession of the League . Properly organised , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In so far as they can be applied , this means that for the blowing up of men to pieces with high explosives , the suffocating of civilian populations with poison gas , the dropping of bombs on crowded cities , the blinding , the mutilation , the brutalisation of myriads of men , we should be substituting merely a temporary dislocation and paralysis of trade , a rise in prices , some restriction of comforts and luxuries , the rationing of necessities , the ignominy of being exhibited as a moral outlaw . There is something in this which satisfies the conscience of the world.4 <p> Paradoxically , there was at the same time an insistence that economic sanctions would be an effective response to military aggression , and would accomplish their goals quickly as well . Woodrow Wilson envisioned sanctions in the following terms : <p> Suppose somebody does not abide by these engagements , then what happens ? An absolute isolation , a boycott ... No goods can be shipped in or out , no telegraphic messages can be exchanged ... there shall be no communication of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the people of that nation . The nationals , the citizens of the Member States , will never enter their territory until the matter is adjusted , and their citizens can not leave their territory . It is the most complete boycott ever conceived in a public document , and I want to say with confident prediction that there will be no more fighting after that . There is not a nation that can stand that for six months.5 <p> The belief that war itself might become obsolete evaporated , and the hope that economic sanctions could stop aggression went with it , when the League of Nations ' attempt to impose sanctions on Mussolini failed to so much as give him pause in the annexation of Ethiopia . Nevertheless , when the Charter of the United Nations was drafted , economic sanctions were incorporated as an option available to the Security Council . Like the Covenant of the League of Nations , the Charter of the United Nations envisions the use of economic sanctions in response to military aggression--the provisions for economic sanctions are contained in Chapter VII of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Peace , Breaches of the Peace , and Acts of Aggression . " Article 41 provides that : <p> The Security Council may decide what measures not involving the use of armed force are to be employed to give effect to its decisions ... These may include complete or partial interruption of economic relations and of rail , sea , air , postal , telegraphic , radio , and other means of communication , and the severance of diplomatic relations . <p> Article 42 provides that where the Security Council finds these measures inadequate , it may use force " to maintain or restore international peace and security . " Thus , although Article 41 does not use the language " sanction " or " boycott , " it clearly contemplates such measures , but only in the context of a " threat to peace , " much the way the Covenant of the League of Nations envisions sanctions for the purpose of deterring military aggression . <p> In reality , the Cold War meant that the Security Council was largely paralyzed . Since both the US and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Security Council in effect could impose no measures on either of the superpowers , or any of their client states . Economic sanctions were imposed only twice in the first forty years of the UN 's existence , on South Africa and Zimbabwe . <p> Outside the context of international governance , sanctions were often used in the twentieth century by individual nations or coalitions as a means of expressing disapproval , or pressuring the government of a target state to change its policies or conduct . They seem to be an ideal form of political influence : a " middle route " that is more substantial than diplomacy , but less destructive than military measures . At the same time , while there are some costs in lost business , there are no direct costs to the state 's budget , so sanctions look quite cheap . They are particularly damaging against countries with a weak economy , or an economy that is highly dependent on imports or exports . As a result , they are particularly attractive to countries with strong and diverse economies , since these countries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not surprising that , since World War II , the US has imposed sanctions more frequently than any other nation . " Of 104 sanctions episodes from World War II through the UN embargo of Iraq , the United States was a key player in two-thirds . In 80 percent of US-imposed sanctions , the policy was pursued with no more than minor cooperation from its allies or international organizations . " 6 <p> Yet they are in fact notoriously ineffectual . The major empirical study of sanctions episodes in the twentieth century is Economic Sanctions Reconsidered7 , which looked at over a hundred sanctions episodes since the end of World War I. The authors concluded that in about one-third of the cases , the sanctions had some success in achieving their stated goals . However , a critic of those studies , Robert Pape , argued that many of those cases were overdetermined : the state 's conduct did change , but there were other factors besides sanctions , such as military intervention , to which this could have been attributed . If we consider only those cases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could with some certainty be attributed to sanctions , we are left with less than 5% of the cases . Thus , by the most optimistic evaluation , sanctions are likely to be ineffectual in two out of three cases ; and those more critical would say that we can not attribute any effectiveness to sanctions 95% of the time . <p> It is easy to see why this would be so . Galtung and others have written of the " rally-round-the-flag effect " --that when the population at large is subject to deprivation by a foreign nation , they respond to it as they would a form of attack , with increased nationalism and support of their political leadership.9 Thus , while the intent of the nation imposing the sanctions might be to " send a message " of the wrongfulness of the target state 's actions , the effect is to consolidate support for the leadership , and its legitimacy is enhanced rather than undermined . At the same time , the political and military leadership is rarely affected directly by any of the economic deprivation inflicted , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the shrinking resources , and can insulate themselves , whether that is justified by security concerns , or simply out of self-interest . In the end , economic sanctions work , if at all , only indirectly : by causing direct suffering to the society , which in turn is intended to create a kind of moral pressure on the leadership . As Walzer describes this phenomenon in siege warfare , what is supposed to influence the leadership is not their own suffering , but " the fearful spectacle of the civilian dead . " 10 <p> Prior to 1990 , there were no sanctions regimes that could have been characterized in such extreme terms . Just as the Cold War paralyzed the Security Council , it also meant that no imposition of economic sanctions could be comprehensive : if the US imposed sanctions on a nation , it could turn to the Soviet Union bloc for trade ; and vice versa . This was crucial in limiting the impact of sanctions . Even though Cuba , for example , has been subject to extensive economic sanctions by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the eastern bloc , allowing it to maintain one of the highest levels of nutrition , education , professional training , and medical care in Latin America . 11 Thus , in the context of the Cold War , sanctions created inconvenience , and imposed costs and obstacles to economic growth , but were never devastating . <p> All of this ended when Iraq invaded Kuwait . Russia , which had replaced the Soviet Union on the Security Council , was in no position to challenge the US , and the US obtained Council support for the most comprehensive economic sanctions ever imposed in the name of international governance . Initially even food was not allowed unconditionally ; it was to be permitted only in " humanitarian circumstances , " and there was considerable dispute over what that meant exactly . 12 Iraq was heavily dependent on oil exports for income ; oil revenues made up 60% of the GDP prior to the Gulf War , 13 and by 1991 gross domestic product had dropped by about three-quarters of its 1990 value to approximate that of the 1940s.14 Iraq @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basic goods ; Iraq imported 70% of cereals , legumes , oils , and sugar , prior to 1991.15 <p> The sanctions were continued after the Gulf War , in which massive bombing devastated Iraq 's infrastructure and industrial capacity . Most crucial was the destruction of the electrical grid , along with water and sewage treatment facilities , roads , and telecommunications . The UN Secretary-General sent envoys in 1991 to report on the situation . In his report to the Secretary-General , Martti Ahtisaari maintained that there would be " further imminent catastrophe , which could include epidemic and famine , if massive life-supporting needs are not rapidly met. " 16 A few months later , a second envoy confirmed this view , and stated that it would take $16 billion dollars to provide electricity and return food , health care , agriculture , water and sanitation to normal levels.17 Instead , the Security Council passed Security Council Resolution 706 , which gave Iraq the opportunity to sell $1.6 billion of oil in a six month period , of which part would be used to pay reparations to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down on the grounds that the funds were so inadequate to the need , and because Iraq would not have a role in determining the humanitarian and economic priorities . 18 However , it is clear that even if Iraq had accepted the plan , the amount of funding permitted was so little that it could not have even met the need for food and medicine , much less the reconstruction of the infrastructure . <p> The Security Council committee charged with implementing the sanctions regime , called the " 661 Committee " after the Security Council resolution imposing the sanctions , had a dual function : it was charged both with enforcing the sanctions and granting humanitarian exemptions . Unsurprisingly , there was immediately a tension between the humanitarian interests and the security concerns ; but there was no guidance in the Council resolutions , or in the UN Charter , for identifying which interest would trump when the two came into conflict . Although food and medicine were allowed through routinely , everything else was subject to an opaque and erratic approval process . There was no precedent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ committee established no clear procedures for reviewing applications for humanitarian purchases , no criteria for determining what goods should be permitted , no guidelines of any sort . The result was that the committee was tremendously inconsistent : ambulance tires would be permitted on one occasion , then denied three months later . Pencils would be permitted , but only in certain quantities . The committee as a matter of policy refused to provide either the vendor or the Iraqi government with explanations of why contracts for humanitarian goods were rejected , and refused to formulate any criteria that could serve as guidelines.19 As a result , Iraq 's ability to buy basic goods was quite limited . In 1994 , for example , half the contracts were denied , with no reason given . 20 <p> Meanwhile , the humanitarian situation in Iraq had deteriorated rapidly . Prior to the Persian Gulf War , the Iraqi government had invested heavily in social and economic development , both before and during the Iran-Iraq war . Prior to the Gulf War , Iraq had made impressive strides in health , education @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ population had access to safe water.21 In 1980 , the Iraqi government initiated a program to reduce infant and child mortality rates by more than half by 1990 . The result was a rapid and steady decline in childhood mortality.22 A 1988 survey in Baghdad conducted by the Food and Agriculture Organization noted that undernourishment was no longer a public health problem ; in fact , 7% of Iraqi children were obese.23 Female literacy was 85%.24 93% of primary school-age children attended school . 25 93% of the population had access to health care.26 97% of urban residents , and 76% of rural residents , had access to health care.27 The majority of Iraqi physicians were trained in Europe or the United States , and one quarter were board certified.28 <p> Following the Gulf War , there were epidemics of cholera and typhoid , diseases that had been very much under control . In 1990 , the incidence of typhoid was 11.3 per 100,000 people ; by 1994 it was more than 142 per 100,000 . In 1989 , there were zero cases of cholera per 100,000 people ; by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the water and sewage treatment facilities during the Gulf War , and Iraq 's difficulty obtaining equipment and chemicals for water treatment , meant that the epidemics became permanent . <p> Once the Oil for Food Programme was put into place in 1996 , the process changed considerably . Basic information was made public to vendors and posted on the web . However , the 661 Committee continued to reject contracts for many of the humanitarian goods Iraq sought to purchase , particularly those relating to the infrastructure , and refused to state any criteria or categories of acceptable goods outside of food and medicine , maintaining the confusion and uncertainty . Because the committee operated by consensus , any member could block or delay any contract ( except for certain categories of uncontroversial goods such as food , which bypassed the committee ) , and could do so for any reason , or for no reason . In practice , the only countries that did so were the United States and , very rarely , Britain . In the face of US security concerns , UN agencies put in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , from contracting to delivery to installation to disposal of the empty containers . Despite this monitoring , US holds increased rather than decreased , from $500 million in August 1999 30 to $5.4 billion in July 2002.31 As a result of these policies , and because Iraqi oil sales to generate income were limited at various points in the program , the overall delivery of humanitarian goods to Iraq since 1996 was about $22 billion , as of July 2002.32 That comes to about $180 per person per year , both for individual needs , such as food and water , and for the rehabilitation of the infrastructure . By contrast , this is about one-half the per capita income in Haiti , the poorest country in the western hemisphere . While the population has some access to other goods , this access is very limited , given how little Iraq is able to produce domestically ; or very costly , involving purchases on the black market . <p> The US has generally justified its objections to infrastructure and other humanitarian imports in terms of security concerns . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a legitimate civilian use but also could have a military use as well . It is also the case that nearly everything related to the infrastructure of a society , or its industrial capacity , could be considered dual use : electrical generators , water pumps for irrigation , bulldozers for construction , radios and telephones , and so on . Manufacturing facilities that produce pesticides or pharmaceuticals , as well as medical laboratories , computer equipment , and high school science labs , can all theoretically be converted to produce chemical or biological agents . However , prohibiting such facilities does mean that Iraq will be consigned to functioning not much above a pre-industrial level . Such a policy , if it continues , will mean that Iraqi is permanently reduced from a highly modernized , highly educated society with a healthy population and an abundance of food , to a Third World country , with extreme levels of poverty , illiteracy , malnutrition , and preventable diseases . <p> The US administration has sometimes argued that this is the cost of ensuring security in the region . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has blocked , for example , water tankers on the grounds that they are on the " 1051 list , " a list of goods that raise military concerns . Clearly , in a country where there is massive child mortality attributable to water-borne diseases , water tankers are of considerable urgency . In fact , UNMOVIC , the UN weapons inspectors charged with identifying and tracking goods on the 1051 list , disputed this US claim . Indeed , there have been hundreds of millions of dollars of " 1051 disputes " --contracts where the security concern raised by the US was directly disputed by the UN 's weapons experts.33 <p> US objections to humanitarian goods have often been criticized for having tenuous justifications , while doing enormous human damage . In winter of 2001 , the US blocked $210 million of child vaccines , maintaining that they might be used to produce biological weapons , and that preventing their import into Iraq was so urgent as to justify the extensive number of child deaths . The information was leaked to the press , and the US was openly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ US lifted the holds , raising questions about whether the US itself had believed that the vaccines presented an urgent security threat.34 There has also been skepticism about US claims of security concerns because of the US politicization of its decisions . For example , the US had blocked $60 million of telecommunications contracts with Chinese manufacturers , insisting that the equipment could be used by the Iraqi military and presented security concerns . But in June 2001 , when the US badly wanted China 's vote on a US proposal concerning Iraq , it lifted the holds immediately , again putting into question the legitimacy of the security claims . 35 <p> In the end , the sanctions regime imposed on Iraq demonstrate graphically that sanctions can no longer be viewed as the relatively benign " middle route . " It turns out that , in their impact , they can in fact look a great deal like siege warfare . Ironically , in the case of Iraq , they also begin to look much like weapons of mass destruction . We might recall that an estimated 140,000 people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Nagasaki . UNICEF estimated two years ago that the " excess mortality " in Iraq--the number dead who would not have been , if conditions prior to the Gulf War had continued--was 500,000 children under five years of age , more than three times the number of dead in Hiroshima and Nagasaki . <p> The US administration , and to some extent UN officials as well , have maintained that the Iraqi government has not been as prompt or cooperative as it should have been , or that to the extent they have had funds outside the Oil for Food Programme at their disposal , they have misused them on military goods or luxuries for Saddam Hussein or the elite . But what is clear is that even if Iraq had the most benevolent and efficient government imaginable , on $180 per person per year , there could not have been anything other than massive impoverishment and suffering ; and that is indeed all that Security Council , in particular the United States , has allowed . <p> The sanctions on Iraq also tell us something about international governance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imagined fifteen years ago that half a million children under five would be dead , under the auspices of a United Nations program ? Denis Halliday , the former UN official in charge of humanitarian agencies in Iraq explicitly uses the term " genocide , " and he resigned from the UN on the grounds that he could not be complicit in such a practice . If the UN itself is in effect implementing what might reasonably be considered a massive human rights violation , then what can we hope for the future of international governance ? <p> We can not avoid the problem of US unilateralism and the need for accountability . In this case , the fundamental tension between security concerns and urgent humanitarian needs was not addressed by the broader international community , in a venue such as the General Assemby , nor was the ambiguity in the UN Charter on this issue considered by a venue such as the International Court of Justice . Rather , it was resolved by the US , which determined unilaterally that security concerns , however tenuous and speculative , would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the absence of an effective venue to examine the validity of US claims , the US simply used its power within the 661 Committee to ensure that Iraq would not be permitted to rebuild its infrastructure , even though it is at the cost of what must be considered simply a human catastrophe . <p> I do not mean to suggest that the Iraqi government had no role in the humanitarian crisis which has gone on now for more than a decade . But we should be clear about what that role is . The US administration has maintained often that if Iraq complied with the disarmament requirement , the sanctions would have been lifted , and the suffering would have ended . However , this claim is problematic , given that the US administrations since the first Bush administration have consistently maintained that they would not agree to lift the sanctions unless there is a change of regime , regardless of whether the Iraqi government complies with the requirements for inspections and disarmament . Yet regime change is not a demand which is contained in any of the Security @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been . The UN Charter , under Chapter VII , authorizes only measures to address aggression , threats to the peace , or breaches of the peace . The Charter itself prohibit the forcible imposition of a " regime change , " at least at the hands of individual nations , when it provides political independence of any state ... " ; and the Security Council resolutions repeatedly reaffirm their commitment to Iraqi sovereignty . Thus , if we take the last three US administrations at their word , there is in fact no relation between Iraq 's compliance or noncompliance and the continuing imposition of sanctions ; and it would seem that the only thing Iraq could have done to lift the sanctions would have been to comply with a unilateral demand of the US for regime change , unauthorized by any institution of international governance , and , arguably , in direct opposition to the UN Charter . <p> As the Bush Administration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the economic sanctions regime may soon be entirely irrelevant . As of this writing , the Bush Administration is discussing when , not whether , to go to war , and envisions doing so with or without the explicit authorization of the Security Council ; with or without the support of its allies in Europe and the Mideast ; and in the face of massive global protests against war . The Bush Administration strategy in this case is described as " shock and awe , " the massive use of missiles against densely populated cities in Iraq as a form of psychological intimidation . A recent UN analysis by the Office of Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs ( OCHA ) anticipates that the human catastrophe will go well beyond psychological intimidation , and in fact will go well beyond the direct destruction done by the bombing . Because there is already such extensive malnutrition , the disruption of the food distribution system would mean that 30% of children under five years of age would be at risk of death ; the destruction of electrical generators , which were heavily bombed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the population would have access to potable water ; this in turn would likely result in epidemics of water-borne diseases ; which would be worsened by shortages of medicines . 36 <p> Precisely these issues--whether regime change can be demanded in a given situation , whether individual nations can justifiably go to war without explicit Security Council authorization , whether particular security claims are well-grounded , and whether security objectives warrant the creation of humanitarian crises--highlight the need for an effective venue of accountability , where a nation seeking to pursue its interests , or seeking to implement its conception of a just world order , must present its information and prove the accuracy of that information ; must present its arguments for the interpretation of the law , and have those arguments judged by an independent judiciary . There is considerable wisdom in the rule of law , and all that it entails : that one may not be a judge in one 's own case ; that the law must be clearly stated , and consistently applied ; that there must be an avenue for appeal ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not their nature or their potential acts . In the end , what the sanctions on Iraq might tell us--as well as the war on Iraq , should it occur--is that the rule of law is fully as urgent in the international arena as it is when an individual is charged with a crime ; since the possibility to interpret the law and impose it as one wishes , without restraint , means not that a person is at risk of abuse or injury , but that a whole people might be destroyed , and most perversely , that this might happen in the name of international law . <p> Selected additional readings : <p> The most comprehensive and well-documented study of the Iraq sanctions regime : Sarah Graham-Brown , Sanctioning Saddam : The Politics of Intervention in Iraq , ( London : I.B.

@@2741303 <p> Global food price spikes in 2008 and again in 2011 coincided with a surge of political unrest in low- and middle-income countries . Angry consumers took to the streets in scores of nations . In some places , food riots turned violent , pressuring governments and in a few cases contributed to their overthrow . Foreign investors sparked a new global land rush , adding a different set of pressures . With scientists cautioning that the world has entered a new era of steadily rising food prices , perhaps aggravated by climate change , the specter of widespread food insecurity and sociopolitical instability weighs on policymakers worldwide . In the past few years , governments and philanthropic foundations began redoubling efforts to resuscitate agricultural research and technology transfer , as well as to accelerate the modernization of food value chains to deliver high quality food inexpensively , faster , and in greater volumes to urban consumers . But will these efforts suffice ? This volume explores the complex relationship between food security and sociopolitical stability up to roughly 2025 . Organized around a series of original essays by leading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that actions taken in an effort to address food security stressors may have consequences for food security , stability , or both that ultimately matter far more than the direct impacts of biophysical drivers such as climate or land or water scarcity .

@@2741309 <h> Strength of a City : A Disaster Research Perspective on the World Trade Center Attack <p> Kathleen J. Tierney <p> The September 11 attacks and their aftermath are a living laboratory for those wishing to better understand how individuals , groups , and organizations respond under extreme disaster conditions . Along with other major disaster events , September 11 revealed much about institutional responses and collective behavior in crises , underscoring what is already known about the social processes that characterize such events , while at the same time highlighting aspects of disasters that the literature has yet to explore fully . <p> The Response to the Attacks : Adaptive and Effective <p> Focusing on New York City as the site of the greatest carnage , destruction , and social disruption and the most complex organized response , much of what was observed on September 11 and in the days and weeks that followed constituted almost a textbook case for the disaster research field . Beginning when the first plane struck , as the disaster literature would predict , the initial response was dominated by prosocial and adaptive behavior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the immediate impact area a response that was initiated and managed largely by evacuees themselves , with a virtual absence of panic saved numerous lives . Assisted by emergency workers , occupants of the World Trade Center and people in the surrounding area helped one another to safety , even at great risk to themselves . In contrast with popular culture and media images that depict evacuations as involving highly competitive behavior , the evacuation process had much in common with those that occur in most major emergencies . Social bonds remained intact , and evacuees were supportive of one another even under extremely high-threat conditions . Prior experience with the 1993 Trade Center bombing had led to significant learning among organizational tenants and occupants of the Towers , and planning and training contributed to their ability to respond in an adaptive fashion to highly ambiguous and threatening conditions . <p> With respect to the organizational response , even though the facility that constituted the central node in the Citys emergency management coordination system , the Emergency Operations Center ( EOC ) at 7 World Trade Center , had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on September 11 , both the management and the conduct of emergency response activities continued uninterrupted through the most intense phase of the crisis . Having lost a technology-rich , state-of-the art facility , experiencing very significant communications disruptions , and facing a massive tragedy unforeseen even in their worst-case plans , response organizations in New York City were highly resilient , showing great capacity to mobilize and coordinate resources . <p> The effective management of the initial emergency response was a major accomplishment for the organizations involved , particularly given the suddenness , severity , and highly unexpected nature of the September 11 attacks . Most US disasters are well-managed , but most US communities have never had to face events on the scale of the 9-11 tragedy in New York . Indeed , some large metropolitan areas have shown themselves to be deficient in response capability in other major crises , as evidenced by the mismanagement of the Los Angeles riots and Hurricane Andrew in 1992 and the inability of the city of Seattle to cope with anti-World Trade Organization demonstrations in 1999 . In each of those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forewarning of significant impending problems and yet were unable to mobilize effectively when those problems materialized . How and why New York was able to cope so well on September 11 is an important topic for future research , but insights can be gleaned both from the disaster literature as well as from research by scholars such as Karl Weick and Gene Rochlin , whose work focuses on factors that contribute to organizational resilience in crisis situations . <p> Improvisation , Emergence , and Convergence <p> In drawing lessons from the New York disaster , it is important to note that while the response activities undertaken by official emergency agencies were crucial , those activities constituted only part of the picture . Equally significant was the manner in which those agencies interacted with and obtained support from non-crisis organizations and from residents of the impact area . September 11 also demonstrates how planned and emergent action blend in disaster settings . It has long been recognized that disasters represent occasions in which the boundaries between organizational and collective behavior are blurred . As disasters become larger and more complex , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ improvisation , as it becomes increasingly evident that those earlier expectations and guidelines no longer apply . The responsibilities of designated crisis-relevant organizations such as emergency medical service providers may be taken over by community residents for periods of time , while new groups emerge to carry out other newly defined tasks . Local capabilities are enhanced through the active involvement of organizations from outside the impact area and of spontaneous volunteers . In the World Trade Center disaster , all these organizational patterns could be observed at Ground Zero and at other key sites in the immediate aftermath of the attack : NYC emergency response organizations were assisted by counterpart organizations from throughout the tri-state region and ultimately from communities around the country , by private organizations offering whatever help they could , and by countless volunteer groups that emerged spontaneously to assist with search and rescue and the provision of support services to emergency workers . <p> For nearly fifty years , disaster scholars have documented and analyzed the phenomenon of disaster-related convergence that is , collective behavior involving the mass movement of people , goods , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emergent definitions that call for altruistic responses and also from a collectively-felt need to provide assistance and solace to the victims of disasters . Both beneficial and problematic , convergence brings needed volunteers and resources to disaster-stricken areas while simultaneously creating substantial management challenges . Like the earthquake that struck Kobe , Japan in 1995 and like other major natural disasters in the US and worldwide , the Trade Center attack became an occasion for large-scale convergence behavior , with both the benefits and the problems convergence creates . Tens of thousands in the immediate impact region took part in vigils of remembrance at fire houses and other sites , performed emergency-related tasks , and formed an astonishing array of support groups to assist and complement the activities of formal disaster response and relief agencies . Hundreds of thousands donated money and goods . And as is typical in major disasters , material donations following the September 11 attack included both things that were urgently needed and goods that were of no conceivable use , creating massive logistical and storage challenges for hard-pressed local agencies . <p> This meshing of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of organized and collective action enabled the City of New York to manage the Trade Center disaster . Effective responses to community crises often look messy from the outside , but that is part of what makes them effective . The failure to understand the emergence and complexity that is typical of major disasters often results in characterizations of disaster settings as chaotic and unorganized . Critical observers may express exasperation because " no one is in charge " as if the activities of hundreds of organizations , thousands of small groups , and tens of thousands of individuals should be controlled in real-time by some single individual or overarching entity . These kinds of comments are often rooted in inappropriate militaristic command-and-control images of disaster management and in a mistrust of non-elites and non-experts . All such criticisms fail to appreciate the strengths of situationally-driven , problem-focused , locally-based , and improvisational response strategies like those observed in New York on September 11 and in the days that followed . <p> Collaboration , Social Divisions , and Conflict <p> The Trade Center disaster also illustrates how in disaster settings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actors can co-exist with societal divisions and conflicts . Disasters are commonly depicted in the literature as " consensus crises " that can be distinguished from wars , civil conflicts , and riots due to the high levels of cooperation and community-wide altruism they engender . Communities responding to disasters are seen as coping with collectively-shared pain , loss , and disruption and as temporarily suspending ongoing conflicts and disagreements in the interest of meeting urgent needs and beginning the recovery process . This was the predominant response to the Trade Center attack , particularly during the first few days . At the same time , however , like other disaster events , September 11 exposed differential vulnerabilities and community fault lines and gave rise to competing and often conflicting disaster framing processes . With few exceptions , poor and marginalized victims of the Trade Tower attack remained as invisible in death as they had in life . After September 11 , the city and the nation seemed to rediscover the underpaid and under-appreciated public safety and municipal employees whose labor makes urban life possible . However , now that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will likely find it difficult to obtain the financial compensation they deserve . Soon after September 11 , conflicts emerged between public safety workers and their families , who insisted on the need to continue the careful and deliberate search for victims and bodies , and city and other governmental agencies wishing to move clean-up and recovery efforts forward as rapidly as possible so as to lesson the negative economic impacts of the attack . <p> In the weeks following September 11 , the barriers erected to prevent public access to Ground Zero became lines of demarcation between the recovery workers on the inside , who collectively defined the impact area as sacred ground , and the sightseers and purveyors of disaster kitsch on the perimeter , who converged to pay their respects , take advantage of photo opportunities , or turn a quick profit on the event . New Yorkers and people across the nation learned what residents of the San Francisco Bay Area discovered ( and loudly denounced ) after the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake : that when the Red Cross solicits donations for victims following major disasters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ despite what contributors may have intended . Groups representing victims of the Trade Center attack have emerged to protest the conduct of disaster relief and recovery efforts and to press compensation-related claims . As these examples show , in addition to bringing community commitment and involvement to new levels , disasters can also constitute occasions for conflict and contentious collective action . <p> Similarly , the recovery period following damaging disasters is often marked by conflicts over the recovery process for example , debates concerning whether a disaster-stricken community should be restored consistent with pre-disaster development patterns or rebuilt in ways consistent with new community visions . Because of the savagery and immense cultural significance of the September 11 attacks , the deep wounds they have caused among survivors , and the enormous economic interests at stake , controversies surrounding reconstruction and recovery planning are certain to be even more heated and protracted than they typically have been after other major disaster events . <p> September 11 and US Disaster Policy <p> The handling of the Trade Center disaster also offers more general insights on the nations policy with respect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ society have been marked by tensions and shifts in emphasis between war planning particularly plans for nuclear war and efforts to manage natural and technological disasters . Over the past five decades , " civil defense , " fallout shelters , and nuclear crisis relocation planning have gradually given way to policies and programs that focus on enhancing the ability of US communities to better respond when disasters strike and to reduce losses through improved pre-event mitigation and planning . The end of the Cold War and the dissolution of the Soviet Union gave further impetus to this policy shift . However , those same changes also sent some elements within the military and defense establishment on a search for new missions . After what was widely acknowledged as an inadequate governmental response to Hurricane Andrew in 1992 , discussions began on whether the military should have a greater role in disaster response within the US . Later , interest grew in applying intelligence- and defense-related technologies to the management of both foreign and domestic disasters . <p> Since September 11 , as new agencies have been created in an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ domestic disaster management has once again taken on a decidedly militaristic tone . The Trade Center disaster was caused by the actions of terrorists , not by a natural disaster agent , and its aftermath blended elements of natural disaster , crime scene , and national security emergency subsequently followed by an anthrax-generated public health emergency . If the past is any indication , domestic security proponents will argue that such highly-complex crisis events need to be managed by military , quasi-military , and law enforcement institutions and by centralized command-and-control structures . However , the literature on community and organizational response to disasters indicates that militarizing disasters even those brought about through terrorism would be taking precisely the wrong lesson from September 11 . Indeed , if the kinds of public response patterns outlined here are ignored in planning for future crises , our society may find itself less capable than before of coping with the next major disaster or terrorist attack . Rather than creating new structures or assigning responsibility for protecting US communities to defense-oriented or non-local institutions , the appropriate strategy should be to continue to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ major community emergencies , which have been shown to work well , and , following New Yorks example , to pursue ways of effectively incorporating volunteers , emergent groups , and a range of civil-society institutions into crisis-management efforts . <h> Related Posts <p> None <h> About the 2001 Essay Archive <p> This is a reformatted post from the SSRC 's original After September 11 essay forum , launched in October of 2001 .

@@2741312 <h> Unauthorized Immigration , Securitization , and the Making of Operation Wetback <p> This paper integrates Agamben 's concept of " bare life " with the Copenhagen School 's concept of " securitization " to develop a framework for analyzing the elevation of immigration out of the realm of ordinary politics and into the realm of security during the 1950s . I argue that immigrants extreme invisibility in daily life and visibility in security-obsessed media venues made them an easy outlet for fears about subversive activity . The success with which state and civil society actors deployed securitizing rhetoric constituted a key precondition for the implementation of Operation Wetback .

@@2741315 <p> What is the role of the laws of war in the ongoing war on terror proclaimed and initiated by the US following the terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001 ? The body of international law applicable in armed conflict does appear to have a bearing on many issues raised in anti-terrorist military operations in Afghanistan as well as elsewhere , including particularly the issues of discrimination in targeting , protection of civilians , and status and treatment of prisoners . Because of the unusual character of the armed conflict , different in important respects from what was originally envisaged in the treaties embodying the laws of war , a key issue in any analysis is not just the laws application or otherwise by the belligerents , but also its relevance to the particular circumstances of this war . It is not just the conduct of the parties that merits examination , but also the adequacy of the law itself . <p> The present essay focuses on three issues . <p> Are the laws of war formally applicable to anti-terrorist military operations ? <p> In the event that anti-terrorist military @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ main international agreements on the laws of war , should the attempt still be made to apply that body of law ? <p> The answers to these questions may vary in different circumstances . The most prominent manifestation of the present US-led war on terror , and the focus of this article , is Operation Enduring Freedom , which commenced in Afghanistan on 7 October 2001 . However , the war on terror has involved , and is anticipated to involve , action in other countries too , each with its own particular legal and factual context . <p> The laws of war ( also referred to as international humanitarian law applicable in armed conflict ) are embodied and interpreted in a variety of sources : treaties , customary law , judicial decisions , writings of legal specialists , military manuals and resolutions of international organisations . Although some of the law is immensely detailed , its basic principles are simple : the wounded and sick , PoWs and civilians are to be protected ; military targets must be attacked in such a manner as to keep civilian casualties and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be respected ; neutral or non-belligerent states have certain rights and duties ; and the use of certain weapons ( including chemical weapons ) is prohibited , as also are other means and methods of warfare that cause unnecessary suffering . The laws of war are the product of negotiations between states , and reflect their experiences and interests , including those of their armed forces . For centuries these rules , albeit frequently the subject of controversy , have had an important function in the policies and practices of states engaged in military operations . Given the need for coalition members to harmonise their actions on a range of practical issues , these rules have had particular significance for international coalitions involved in combat . Even in situations in which their formal applicability may be questionable , they have sometimes been accepted as relevant guidelines . <p> The four 1949 Geneva Conventions the treaties that form a key part of the modern laws of war are concerned not so much with the conduct of war as with the protection of victims of war who have fallen into the hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ variety of situations . Common Article 1 specifies that the parties undertake to respect and to ensure respect for the present Convention in all circumstances . Common Article 2 specifies that the Conventions apply to all cases of declared war or of any other armed conflict which may arise between two or more of the High Contracting Parties , even if the state of war is not recognized by one of them . Thus the existence or non-existence of a declaration of war , or a formal state of war , is not necessary for the application of the Conventions . Despite such provisions , the laws of war in general , and the Geneva Conventions in particular , have often proved difficult to apply in anti-terrorist military operations . <p> The laws of war are not the only body of law potentially relevant to the consideration of terrorist actions . In many cases , acts committed by terrorists would indeed be violations of the laws of war if they were conducted in the course of an international or even internal armed conflict . However , because they frequently occur @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of such acts has to be established first and foremost by reference to the national law of states ; international treaties on terrorism and related matters ; - 1 and other relevant parts of international law ( including parts of the laws of war ) that apply in peacetime as well as wartime , for example the rules relating to genocide , crimes against humanity and certain rules relating to human rights . The attacks of 11 September should be regarded as falling within the legal category of crimes against humanity , which encompasses widespread or systematic murder against any civilian population . 2 <p> By contrast , the laws of war constitute a principal ( though not exclusive ) legal framework regarding the conduct of anti-terrorist military operations , and responses thereto , especially when these assume the character of an armed conflict . <p> Jus ad bellum and jus in bello <p> In any armed conflict , including one against terrorism , it is important to distinguish between the legality of resorting to force and the legality of the way in which such force is used . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to resort to the use of force ( jus ad bellum ) and the law governing the actual use of force in war ( jus in bello ) are separate . The latter applies to the conduct of international conflict irrespective of the issue of the right of the belligerents to resort to the use of force . Although I do not doubt the importance and complexity of jus ad bellum issues raised after 11 September , and despite having personal views ( in favour of the legality , and indeed overall justifiability , of the military action in Afghanistan ) , this essays focus is on the jus in bello aspects of the US-led military operations . <p> Despite the lack of a formal connection between jus ad bellum and jus in bello , there are certain ways in which they interact in practice . Observance of jus in bello may contribute to perceptions of the justice of a cause in three main respects . First , in all military operations , whether or not against terrorists , a perception that a state or a coalition of states is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the state or coalition ; support , or at least tacit consent , from other states ; and avoidance of disputes within and between coalition member states . Second , if the coalition were to violate jus in bello in a major way , for example by committing atrocities , that would help the cause of the adversary forces and even provide them with a justification for their resort to force under jus ad bellum . Third , in anti-terrorist campaigns in particular , a basis for engaging in military operations is often a perception that there is a definite moral distinction between the types of actions engaged in by terrorists and those engaged in by their adversaries . Observance of jus in bello can form a part of that moral distinction . <p> However , the jus ad bellum rationale that armed hostilities have been initiated in response to major terrorist acts can raise issues relating to the application of certain jus in bello principles . Two such issues are explored here : first , whether there is scope for neutrality in relation to an anti-terrorist war ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ viewed as exclusively responsible for all the death and destruction of an ensuing war . <p> The right of states to be neutral in an armed conflict is a long-standing principle of the laws of war . Events of the past century , especially the growth of international organisations including the United Nations have exposed problems in the traditional idea of strictly impartial neutrality and have led to its modification and even erosion . In many conflicts there were states which , even while not belligerents , pursued policies favouring one side , for example joining in sanctions against a state perceived to be an aggressor . The importance of such forms of non-belligerence , distinct from traditional neutrality , may help to explain the emergence of terms such as neutral or non-belligerent powers in post-1945 treaties on the laws of war . 3 <p> In respect of Afghanistan , the sanctions initiated by the UN Security Council against the Taliban regime in 1999 , on account of its support of terrorism and its refusal to hand over Osama bin Laden , had already required all states to take action @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ September , the UN Security Council promptly adopted resolutions stating that all states were to take a wide range of actions against terrorism. - 5 President George W. Bush went substantially further , stating in his 20 September address to Congress : <p> Every nation , in every region , now has a decision to make . Either you are with us , or you are with the terrorists . From this day forward , any nation that continues to harbor or support terrorism will be regarded by the United States as a hostile regime . <p> He also said in his peroration : Freedom and fear , justice and cruelty , have always been at war , and we know that God is not neutral between them. - 6 It is evident that the scope for traditional neutrality was implicitly understood by the Security Council , and explicitly proclaimed by the US , to be very limited in this anti-terrorist war . Naturally , some states , including Iran , proclaimed that they were with neither Bush nor bin Laden ' ; and not all states were willing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war confirmed the lesson of many recent episodes , including the 1991 Gulf War and the 1999 Kosovo War , that when armed conflict by a coalition is combined with the application of general UN sanctions against the adversary state , the scope for traditional ( i.e. impartial ) neutrality is indeed limited especially so when , as in the case of al-Qaeda , the adversary operates in numerous states , which are required by the UN to take a range of measures against it . <p> The general indignation caused by terrorist attacks can also affect the implementation of jus in bello when fighting terrorism is the jus ad bellum . Because the terrorists started the war , it is sometimes argued , they are responsible for all the death and destruction that ensues . Such a view , implying that the peculiar circumstances involved in the jus ad bellum might override certain considerations of jus in bello in the war that follows , has no basis in the law . There was evidence of such thinking in some statements made in the US in connection with Afghanistan . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Defense Donald Rumsfeld said : We did not start this war . So understand , responsibility for every single casualty in this war , whether they 're innocent Afghans or innocent Americans , rests at the feet of the al-Qaeda and the Taliban. 7 <p> Another possible connection between jus ad bellum and jus in bello relates to the principle of proportionality . This is a long-established principle that sets out criteria for limiting the use of force . One of its meanings relates to the proportionality of a military action compared to a grievance . It involves a complex balance of considerations , and it would be incorrect to interpret this principle to imply a right of tit-for-tat retaliation . It would be legally unjustified for a military response to a terrorist act to have the objective of killing the same number of people and there was no suggestion or indication that this was a coalition objective . <p> The other main meaning of proportionality relates to the actual conduct of ongoing hostilities . As a US Army manual succinctly interprets it , the loss of life and damage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relation to the concrete and direct military advantage expected to be gained. - 8 This meaning of proportionality is an important underlying principle of jus in bello , and is not directly linked to jus ad bellum . However , this meaning of the principle is often difficult to apply in armed conflict . It may , but does not necessarily , limit the use of force to the same level or amount of force as that employed by an adversary . It exists alongside the principle of military necessity , which is defined in the US Army manual as one that justifies those measures not forbidden by international law which are indispensable for securing the complete submission of the enemy as soon as possible. - 9 The principle of proportionality is therefore in tension , but not necessarily in conflict , with the current US military doctrine which favours the overwhelming use of force in order to achieve decisive victory quickly and at minimum cost in terms of US casualties . 10 <p> Anti-terrorist military operations <p> Anti-terrorist military operations , including those resulting from the events of 11 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from those of inter-state armed conflicts as principally envisaged in the laws of war . This is because of six factors relating to the nature of the opposition : <p> Neither all terrorist activities , nor all anti-terrorist military operations , even when they have some international dimension , necessarily constitute armed conflict between states . Terrorist movements themselves generally have a non-state character . Military operations between a state and such a movement , even if they involve the states armed forces acting outside its own territory , are not necessarily such as to bring them within the scope of application of the full range of provisions regarding international armed conflict in the 1949 Geneva Conventions and the 1977 Geneva Protocol I. 11 <p> Anti-terrorist operations may assume the form of actions by a government against forces operating within its own territory ; or , more rarely , may be actions by opposition forces against a government perceived to be committing or supporting terrorist acts . In both these cases , the conflict may have more the character of non-international armed conflict ( that is , civil war ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been formally applicable to civil as distinct from international war , although the situation is now changing in some respects . <p> In many cases , the attributes and actions of a terrorist movement may not come within the field of application even of the modest body of rules relating to non-international armed conflict . Common Article 3 of the 1949 Geneva Conventions is the core of these rules , but says little about the scope of application . The principal subsequent agreement on non-international armed conflict , the 1977 Geneva Protocol II , is based on the assumption that there is a conflict between a states armed forces and organised armed groups which , under responsible command , exercise control over a part of its territory , and carry out sustained and concerted military operations . The protocol expressly does not apply to situations of internal disturbance and tension , such as riots , and isolated and sporadic acts of violence . 12 <p> Since terrorist forces often have little regard for internationally agreed rules of restraint , the resolve of the anti-terrorist forces to observe them may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the tendency of some part of the public under attack to overlook any breaches by their own forces . <p> A basic principle of the laws of war is that attacks should be directed against the adversarys military forces , rather than against civilians . This principle , violated in terrorist attacks specifically directed against civilians , can be difficult to apply in anti-terrorist operations , because the terrorist movement may not be composed of defined military forces that are clearly distinguished from civilians . <p> Some captured personnel who are members of a terrorist organization may not meet the criteria for PoW status as set out in the 1949 Geneva Convention III . In particular , such personnel may fail to pass the tests of belonging to a Party to the conflict , being commanded by a person responsible for his subordinates , wearing a fixed distinctive sign , and conducting their operations in accordance with laws and customs of war . However , even if they are not entitled to PoW status , such persons should still be treated humanely . ( The question of prisoners is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ factors reflect the same underlying difficulty governments have in applying the laws of war to civil wars , namely , that the opponent tends to be viewed as a criminal , without the right to engage in combat operations . This factor above all explains why , despite the progress of recent decades , many governments are anxious about applying the full range of rules applicable in international armed conflict to operations against rebels and terrorists . <p> For at least 25 years , the US has expressed a concern , shared to some degree by certain other states , about the whole principle of thinking about terrorism in a laws-of-war framework . To refer to such a framework , which recognises rights and duties , might seem to imply a degree of moral acceptance of the right of any particular group to resort to acts of violence , at least against military targets. - 13 Successive US administrations have objected to certain revisions to the laws of war on the grounds that they might actually favour guerrilla fighters and terrorists , affording them a status that the US believes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1987 , President Reagan explained why he was not recommending Senate approval of 1977 Geneva Protocol I additional to the 1949 Geneva Conventions , he mentioned that granting combatant status to certain irregular forces would endanger civilians among whom terrorists and other irregulars attempt to conceal themselves . In addition , he indicated a concern that the provisions would endanger US soldiers when he stated in very general terms that the Joint Chiefs of Staff have also concluded that a number of the provisions of the protocol are militarily unacceptable . He argued that US repudiation of the protocol was an important move against the intense efforts of terrorist organisations and their supporters to promote the legitimacy of their aims and practices. - 14 Whether all this was based on a fair interpretation of 1977 Protocol I is the subject of impassioned debate which is beyond the scope of this survey . The key point is the US concern which has not changed fundamentally in the years since 1987 that the laws of war might be misused by some in order to give an unwarranted degree of recognition to terrorists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> While the application of the law may be particularly difficult in anti-terrorist operations , it is not unimportant . Indeed , some failures to observe legal restraints in past campaigns have been instructive . In military operations with the purpose of stopping terrorist activities , there has been a tendency for counter-terrorist forces to violate basic legal restraints . There have been many instances in which prisoners were subjected to mistreatment or torture . In some cases , excesses by the government or by intervening forces may have contributed to the growth of a terrorist campaign against it . External states supporting the government have sometimes contributed to such excesses . Applying pressure on a government or army to change its approach to anti-terrorism , to bring it more into line with the laws of war and human-rights law , can be a difficult task . <p> One example of an anti-terrorist military campaign , the 1982-2000 Israeli presence in Lebanon , shows the importance of legal restraints in anti-terrorist operations , and the hazards that can attend a failure to observe them . This episode has certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well as some obvious differences . <p> Israels June 1982 invasion of Lebanon was explicitly in response to constant terrorist provocations , including , since July 1981 , 150 acts of terrorism instigated by the PLO , originating in Lebanon , against Israelis and Jews in Israel and elsewhere : in Athens , Vienna , Paris and London . Israel said that if Lebanon was unwilling or unable to prevent the harbouring , training and financing of terrorists , it must face the risk of counter-measures. - 15 The invasion led to the attacks on the inhabitants of Sabra and Shatila refugee camps outside Beirut in September 1982 by Israels local co-belligerents , the Lebanese Phalangists . At the lowest estimates , several hundred Palestinians in the camps , including many women and children , were killed . This event aroused strong opposition internationally , and also in Israel . The Israeli authorities established a Commission of Inquiry , which concluded that , while the Phalangist forces were directly responsible for the slaughter , Israel bore indirect responsibility. - 16 During the whole period of Israeli military involvement in Lebanon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Israel was opposed to giving them PoW status on the grounds that as terrorists they were not entitled to it . The detainees were held in very poor conditions in notorious camps , including al-Khiam ( run by the Israeli-created South Lebanese Army ) and al-Ansar ( run by the Israel Defence Forces ) . - 17 The Israeli military presence in Lebanon received extensive criticism internationally and in Israel , and it cost many lives among the Israel Defence Forces as well as their adversaries and in the civilian population . It ended with a unilateral Israeli withdrawal in May 2000 . <p> Most anti-terrorist operations are largely internal matters , conducted by governments within their own territories , often within certain legal and prudential limits . Within functioning states , terrorist campaigns have often been defeated through slow and patient police work ( sometimes with military assistance ) rather than major military campaigns ; for example , the actions against the Red Army Faction in Germany and the Red Brigades in Italy in the 1970s . The British military and police operation against Communist Terrorists in Malaya @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ context ) of a long-drawn-out and patient anti-terrorist campaign that was eventually successful . <p> In other contexts , too , Western armed forces , engaging with adversaries showing at best limited respect for ethical and legal restraints , have themselves managed to observe basic rules of the laws of war . This was the case in the 1991 Gulf War , in which Iraq mistreated prisoners , despoiled the environment and had to be warned in brutally clear terms not to engage in chemical or biological attacks and terrorist operations . The US-led Gulf coalition sought to observe the law not because of any guarantee of reciprocity , but because such conduct was important to the maintenance of internal discipline , and of domestic and international support . Similar conclusions were drawn from the 1999 Kosovo War . Reciprocity with one adversary in one particular conflict is not the only basis for observing the laws of war . <p> The US armed forces have indicated their intention to observe the rules governing international armed conflicts , even in situations which may differ in certain respects from the classical model @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Standing Rules of Engagement issued by the US Joint Chiefs of Staff on 15 January 2000 spells this out : <p> US forces will comply with the Law of War during military operations involving armed conflict , no matter how the conflict may be characterized under international law , and will comply with its principles and spirit during all other operations . 18 <p> The development by US and allied forces of techniques of bombing that are more accurate than in previous eras has increased the technical possibilities of air power being employed discriminately , and therefore in a manner that is compatible with laws-of-war rules about targeting . This is a momentous development in the history of war , yet its effects , especially as regards operations against terrorists , should not be exaggerated , as it can not guarantee no deaths of innocents . Precision-guided weapons are generally better at hitting fixed objects , such as buildings , than moving objects which can be concealed , such as tanks . Civilian deaths will still occur , whether because certain dual-use targets are attacked , because of the proximity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intelligence and human or mechanical errors . In addition , malevolence and callousness can still lead to attacks on the wrong places or people . A further problem with the new type of US bombing campaign is that , in the eyes of third parties , it can easily look as if the US puts a lower value on the lives of Iraqis or Serbs or Afghans than it does on its own almost-invulnerable aircrews : a perception which can feed those hostile views of the US that help to provide a background in which terrorism can flourish . <p> In an anti-terrorist war , as in other wars , there can be strong prudential considerations that militate in favour of observing the laws of war . These include securing public and international support ; ensuring that terrorists are not given the propaganda gift of atrocities by their adversaries ; and maintaining discipline and high professional standards in the counter-terrorist forces . Such considerations may carry great weight even in conflicts , or particular episodes within them , which differ from what is envisaged in the formal provisions regarding scope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ observing the law may be important irrespective of whether there is reciprocity in observance of the law by all the parties to a particular war . However , it is not realistic to expect that the result of the application of such rules will be a sanitised form of war in which civilian suffering and death is eliminated . <p> Afghanistan <p> In wars in Afghanistan over the centuries , conduct has differed markedly from that permitted by the laws of war . These wars always had a civil war dimension , traditionally subject to fewer rules in the laws of war ; and guerrilla warfare , already endemic in Afghanistan in the nineteenth century , notoriously blurs the distinction between soldier and civilian which is at the heart of the laws of war . Some local customs , for example regarding the killing of prisoners and looting , are directly contrary to long-established principles of the law . Other customs are different from what is envisaged by the law , but are not necessarily a violation of it : for example , the practice of soldiers from the defeated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In some cases , conduct has been consistent with international norms : for example , the International Committee of the Red Cross ( ICRC ) had access to some prisoners during the Soviet intervention . Overall , however , compliance has been limited . <p> The war in Afghanistan principally between the Taliban and Northern Alliance forces had been going on for many years before the events of 11 September 2001 . Both parties were called upon to comply with their obligations under international humanitarian law . UN Security Council Resolution 1193 of 28 August 1998 , passed unanimously , reaffirmed inter alia <p> that all parties to the conflict are bound to comply with their obligations under international humanitarian law and in particular the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949 , and that persons who commit or order the commission of grave breaches of the Conventions are individually responsible in respect of such breaches . <p> The reference to grave breaches would appear to suggest that the Security Council viewed all the rules of the 1949 Geneva Conventions as applicable , and not just common Article 3 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this resolution are a reminder that , three years before it became directly involved , the US as well as other powers did view the laws of war as applicable to the Afghan conflict . <p> Following the events of 11 September 2001 , when it was evident that an armed conflict between the coalition and the Taliban was likely , the ICRC , consistent with its general practice , sent confidential messages to certain governments reminding them of their obligations under international humanitarian law . Unfortunately , in the first of what would be many clashes between humanitarian bodies and national governments in this crisis , the ICRC messages touched on the issue of nuclear weapons in a way that invited antagonism and rejection : a replacement message had to be sent. - 19 The ICRC subsequently issued some public statements on the application of the laws of war in this crisis , reminding all the parties involved the Taliban , the Northern Alliance and the US-led coalition of their obligations to respect the law , and stating that the ICRC was continuing a wide range of activities inside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 1979-89 , and indeed wars in many countries in the period since 1945 , the war in Afghanistan from 7 October 2001 to the present can perhaps be best characterised as internationalised civil war . This is not a formal legal category , but an indication that the rules pertaining to both international and civil wars may be applicable in different aspects and phases of the conflict . 21 <p> On the technical legal question as to which of the main laws of war treaties have been formally binding on the belligerents in the hostilities in Afghanistan since October 2001 , the 1907 Hague Convention IV on land warfare applies because of its status as customary law , binding on all states whether or not parties to the treaty . In addition , Afghanistan , and also the main members of the international coalition , are parties to the following agreements : <p> the 1925 Geneva Protocol on gas and bacteriological warfare ; <p> the 1948 Genocide Convention ; <p> the four 1949 Geneva Conventions . <p> While some of the states involved are parties to certain additional agreements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considering the application of the law in this particular armed conflict . In addition , rules of customary international law apply , including certain provisions of 1977 Geneva Protocol I that are accepted as having that status . <p> As regards civil-war aspects of the Afghan war , some but not all of the provisions of the agreements listed above apply . The 1907 Hague Land War Conventions Article 2 indicates that the convention and its annexed regulations apply only to wars between states . The 1925 Geneva Protocol is not formally applicable to civil wars. - 22 The 1948 Genocide Convention is considered to apply to non-international as well as international armed conflict . In the 1949 Geneva Conventions , common Article 3 lists certain minimum provisions for humane treatment of those taking no active part in hostilities that are to be applied in non-international armed conflict . <p> The implementation of the laws of war posed a problem for Operation Enduring Freedom from the start . The number of Afghan forces involved in the war , many of which were under local warlords , and the lack of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , were all complicating factors . One of the groups involved , al-Qaeda , had committed or supported numerous criminal acts in foreign countries . Difficult practical issues facing the coalition included : the need to conduct operations discriminately ; the possibility that adversary forces might mistreat or execute coalition prisoners ; the possibility that some enemy personnel facing capture might be reluctant to surrender their weapons , and that they might not qualify for PoW status ; maintenance of order ( and avoidance of looting and revenge killings ) in liberated towns ; how to bring pressure on Northern Alliance forces to observe basic norms ; and assistance for humanitarian relief operations . <p> The active role of the media in this war has ensured that these issues have been heavily publicised . Reporters are operating close to , and even in front of , the front lines , sending back reports and high-resolution pictures as events unfold . Up to the end of January 2002 , more reporters had died while covering the war in Afghanistan than non-Afghan coalition military personnel. - 23 The lesson of other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a critical role in repeatedly raising matters germane to the laws of war . <p> One issue relating to the laws of war which impacted upon all phases of operations in Afghanistan is humanitarian relief . Such relief constitutes a major activity in almost all contemporary wars . The need for humanitarian relief is particularly likely to arise in anti-terrorist operations against a weak or failed state , because such states breed conditions in which terrorist movements can operate and large-scale human misery can occur . The fact of a war being against terrorists , while it may affect the mode of delivery ( since land convoys may be vulnerable to seizure ) does not affect the law applicable to the provision of relief . The basic obligations of the various parties to an armed conflict to assist in and protect humanitarian relief operations are embodied in 1949 Geneva Convention IV , on civilians . 24 <p> Humanitarian relief issues proved critically important in Afghanistan . Announcing the start of Operation Enduring Freedom , President Bush stated : As we strike military targets , we will also drop food , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women and children of Afghanistan. - 25 US forces air-dropped considerable quantities of aid at the same time as the major bombing operations took place . There was tension between the US and humanitarian agencies , some of which were critical of the bombing campaign , doubtful of the value of air-dropped supplies and concerned about the aggravated risks and obstacles to their work that resulted from the military operations . While the effects of war and the onset of winter heightened the urgent need for aid , the collapse of the Taliban regime in early December 2001 and its replacement by the interim administration facilitated , but by no means guaranteed , the secure delivery of aid by land routes . A wide range of countries and organisations took part in the provision of aid. - 26 Refugees started to return in significant numbers : over 3,000 per day in January , but there were also movements of ethnic Pashtun from Afghanistan to Pakistan . 27 <p> Bombing <p> The anti-terrorist rationale of the coalition operations in Afghanistan gave a particular character to two issues on which the laws @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ status and treatment of prisoners . <p> The principle that the bombing of Afghanistan should be discriminate was repeatedly stated . On 21 October , General Richard B. Myers , the Chair of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , said : <p> The last thing we want are any civilian casualties . So we plan every military target with great care . We try to match the weapon to the target and the goal is , one , to destroy the target , and two , is to prevent any what we call collateral damage or damage to civilian structures or civilian population . 28 <p> US bombing in Afghanistan aroused much international concern , particularly as regards civilian casualties and damage . There were reports of many attacks causing significant numbers of civilian casualties and damage . Two attacks in October hit an ICRC warehouse in Kabul . According to press reports , over a hundred villagers may have died in bombings on 1-2 December of Kama Ado and neighbouring villages in eastern Afghanistan , not far from the cave complex at Tora Bora . In several cases , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not a laws-of-war issue as such , and is not uncommon in armed conflicts , it highlights the fact that bombing remains far from clinically accurate . <p> It is difficult to arrive at a reliable estimate of the overall number of civilian deaths caused by the bombing in Afghanistan . As in the 1991 Gulf and 1999 Kosovo wars , the Pentagon has been reluctant to issue figures . Apart from certain statements by the Taliban , the highest reported estimate is over 3,500 as of mid-December , but there are grounds for doubt. - 29 In sharp response , Rumsfeld stated in an interview on 8 January 2002 that <p> there probably has never in the history of the world been a conflict that has been done as carefully , and with such measure , and care , and with such minimal collateral damage to buildings and infrastructure , and with such small numbers of unintended civilian casualties . 30 <p> Even if the figure is an over-estimate , the bombing has clearly resulted in large numbers of civilian deaths and caused thousands of Afghan civilians to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put right such human and material damage as can be repaired . <p> In legal terms , the incidence of civilian deaths per se may not always constitute a violation , absent other factors ; and there are strong reasons to believe US statements that civilian deaths in the above types of episode were unintended . Some may well have resulted from errors of various kinds , and some may have been unavoidable collateral damage . One cause of civilian casualties may have been the fact that , in a legacy from the period of Soviet involvement in Afghanistan , many Taliban military assets were located in towns , where they were less vulnerable to raids from rural-based guerrillas , but where they were of course closer to civilians who risked getting hit in bombing attacks . While much of the bombing was discriminate , questions are raised about whether all appropriate measures were taken to reduce civilian casualties and damage . Even if much of the civilian death and destruction is not a violation of the law , the resulting adverse public perception risks harming the coalition cause . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had acted indiscriminately . Rumsfeld accused the Taliban and al-Qaeda leaders of both causing and faking civilian damage : They are using mosques for command and control , for ammunition storage , and they 're not taking journalists in to show that . What they do is when there 's a bomb goes down , they grab some children and some women and pretend that the bomb hit the women and the children.- 32 What truth there is in all this is difficult to determine . <p> Did the concern over civilian casualties undermine the US bombing effort ? Its eventual success against the Taliban would suggest not , but there were indications that the concern had serious effects . It was reported that the US had deliberately slowed the pace of the campaign , and increased the risk to the people executing it , because of legal restraints and moral values . It was also stated that war planners frequently chose not to hit particular targets , even if they were militarily important , and pilots allegedly complained of lost opportunities . Yet the planners could not give their reasoning for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adversary a recipe book for not being bombed . The issue of civilian casualties also became ammunition for inter-service battles , particularly for Army arguments in favour of boots on the ground . 33 <p> One issue raised by the bombing , and which involved the risk of immediate and possible future civilian casualties , was the use of cluster bombs . These are air-dropped canisters containing numerous separate bomblets which disperse over a given area . The bomblets , which are meant to explode on impact or to self-deactivate after a specific period , can cause particularly severe problems if they fail to do so . There have been objections to their use , principally on the ground that they have a tendency , like anti-personnel land-mines , to kill people long after the conflict is over . Reports from Kosovo and elsewhere have confirmed the general seriousness of the problem. - 34 On the other hand , some evidence from the Afghanistan campaign suggests that cluster bombs were an effective weapon . As the law stands , there has been no firm agreement to outlaw cluster bombs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ per se , their use does raise questions regarding their compatibility with fundamental principles of the laws of war . They are certain to be the subject of further pressures to limit or stop their use , or to ensure more effective safeguards against later accidental detonations . <p> A second issue concerns the use of bombing in the hunt for Taliban and al-Qaeda personnel , following the fall of the Taliban regime in early December 2001 . In the preceding phase , bombing had been used primarily in support of Northern Alliance frontal operations aimed at capturing the main Taliban-held cities . Once this was achieved , a good deal of the bombing was directed against remnant Taliban and al-Qaeda forces and their leaders . Several incidents were reported in the press in which those killed were neither . The reports drew attention to the difficulty of distinguishing between civilians and these forces . They also raised the question , of broader significance in anti-terrorist wars : to what extent is bombing an appropriate form of enforcement once a state is , to a greater or lesser degree , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the terrorists ? At that point , to what extent can the focus be transferred to other forms of police and military action that may be less likely than bombing to cause civilian casualties ? <p> One long-standing prohibition in warfare is the rule against use of gas and bacteriological methods of warfare . The US repeatedly expressed concern that al-Qaeda might be preparing to use such methods in terrorist attacks . In addition , there were situations in which there could have been pressures for the US to use gas . When , in 1975 , the US ratified the 1925 Geneva Protocol , it indicated that it considered that certain uses of riot-control agents in armed conflict did not violate the protocol. - 35 In early December 2001 , Rumsfeld was asked at a press conference if the US might use gas in the hunt for Taliban and al-Qaeda personnel in mountain caves . Rumsfelds response contained no denial : <p> Well , I noticed that in Mazar , the way they finally got the dead-enders to come out was by flooding the tunnel . And finally they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elements . And I guess one will do whatever it is necessary to do . If people will not surrender , then theyve made their choice . 36 <p> Prisoners <p> From late November 2001 , the status and treatment of prisoners taken in the war on terror became a major international controversy . Within the Pentagon , if not necessarily at the political level , it had been recognised early on that the prisoner issue could be difficult . An unpublished document circulated by the USAFs International and Operations Law Division on 21 September 2001 outlined the dimensions of the problem : terrorists were to be treated as unlawful combatants ' ; it was very unlikely that a captured terrorist will be legally entitled to PoW status under the Geneva Conventions ' ; however , there was a practical US interest in application of Law of Armed Conflict principles in the context of reciprocity of treatment of captured personnel. As regards treatment upon capture , <p> if a terrorist is captured , Department of Defense members must at the very least comply with the principles and spirit of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ US military personnel will be given the protections of but not the status of a PoW. 37 , pp. 5-6 . <p> Initially , international attention focused on one event : the killing of a large number of Taliban and al-Qaeda prisoners following the revolt at Qala-e Jhangi Fort near Mazar-e Sharif in the period 25 November -1 December 2001 . Even before the prisoners were taken at Kunduz at around the time of its fall on 23-24 November , it was evident that the surrender and imprisonment of the non-Afghan forces fighting alongside the Taliban would be extremely difficult . At the same time , there was very little sign of serious preparation for handling prisoners , large numbers of whom were likely to be particularly dangerous . The precise chain of events leading to the revolt has yet to be established , but the causes appear to include the following heady mix : these were particularly fanatical soldiers , for whom the whole concept of surrender would be anathema ; the arrangements for receiving , holding and processing the prisoners appear to have been ad hoc and casual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weapons , and by not having laid down their arms they failed to meet the requirements for PoW status ; the prisoners were held in a place where there was a large store of weapons , to which they gained access ; and some reports suggest that the prisoners feared that they were about to be killed , so had nothing to lose by revolt . <p> When asked at a press conference whether the suppression of the prison revolt at Mazar-e Sharif had been proportionate , Rumsfeld indicated bafflement : <p> Now , the word proportion proportionate is interesting . And I do n't  know that its appropriate . And I do n't  know that I could define it . But it might be said and I would n't say it ( laughter ) but it might be said by some that to quickly and aggressively repress a prison riot in one location might help dissuade people in other locations from engaging in prison riots and breaking out of prison and killing more people . I do n't  know that that 's true . It might also persuade the people who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and killing other people , to stop doing it +G- Your questions too tough for me . I do n't  know what proportionate would be . 38 <p> The revolt at Qala-e Jhangi Fort was a desperate struggle in which not only many prisoners , but also a number of Northern Alliance troops in charge of the fort , died . US bombing , and sharp-shooting by UK special forces , played a part in the defeat of the uprising . Public discussion in the UK and elsewhere has focused on the events at the fort , including the question of whether the force used to quell the rebellion was excessive . If the situation was as desperate and threatening as reports indicated , the use of force is hardly surprising . Public discussion should more usefully focus on how prisoners should be received and dealt with . Events at the fort raised the issue of whether the US and , in particular , the Northern Alliance , had a clear policy for treating prisoners , including the foreign fighters . The real cause of the disaster was probably a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the fort , and especially the failure to disarm all prisoners . <p> Other reports of maltreatment and deaths of prisoners elsewhere confirm that the overall approach of the Northern Alliance was defective . In particular , by late December there had been numerous reports of Afghan captors beating their detainees , and the ICRC was reported as expressing concern that it had been able to register only 4,000 of the 7,000 prisoners which the US said it and its Afghan allies had in custody . 39 <p> The actual influence of the US and its coalition partners over the Northern Alliances actions in such basic matters as protection of prisoners and whether they used it is open to question . Coalition members have expressed different views on this . In his Pentagon press briefing on 30 November , Rumsfeld indicated in general terms , not in connection to the prisoner question that the US does have influence with the forces with which it operated in Afghanistan : <p> We have a relationship with all of those elements on the ground . We have provided them food . We 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provided winter clothing . Weve worked with them closely . We have troops embedded in their forces and have been assisting with overhead targeting and resupply of ammunition . Its a relationship . 40 <p> This contrasts with an earlier statement of British Prime Minister Tony Blair , who was asked on 13 November , again in general terms , What sanctions do we have over the Northern Alliance ? . He replied simply , None . 41 <p> The question of the status and treatment of al-Qaeda fighters taken prisoner in Afghanistan , arguably distinguishable from the status and treatment of Taliban fighters taken prisoner , involves the important but difficult issue of whether or not such combatants are considered lawful . The key factor in determining the lawfulness of a combatant , and therefore the entitlement to participate directly in hostilities , is the affiliation of the combatant to a party to the conflict . <p> Lawful combatants comprise the organised armed forces ( including militias and volunteer corps ) of a state or otherwise recognised party to a conflict . They also include members of certain other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movements , belonging to a party to the conflict , provided that they meet certain criteria : they must be under a responsible command system ; wear a fixed distinctive sign ; carry arms openly ; and conduct their operations in accordance with the laws of war . Members of regular armed forces who meet such criteria may well be lawful combatants even if the regime that they serve is not recognised as the lawful government of the state . Lawful combatants are entitled to PoW status and all of the rights set forth in the Geneva Convention III . Lawful combatants can not be punished for the mere fact of having participated directly in hostilities , but they can be tried for any violations of international law , including the laws of war , they may have committed . <p> What is the status of those many people who are involved in hostile activities in various ways , but who fail to meet the above criteria ? Since the Second World War , the problem had arisen repeatedly ; one suggested term for a wide range of such combatants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the criteria were viewed as entitled to PoW status , but not all were. - 43 In current US military manuals two terms with apparently identical meaning , unlawful combatants and illegal combatants , are used to refer to those who are viewed as not being members of the armed forces of a party to the conflict and not having the right to engage in hostilities against an opposing party. - 44 Such combatants can face penal sanctions for participating directly in hostilities and for other acts they may commit , and they do not have the right to PoW status ; but they do retain a claim to certain fundamental guarantees regarding their detention and any judicial proceedings against them . <p> The distinction between lawful and unlawful combatants is important . Article 5 of the 1949 Geneva Convention III provides that , in cases of doubt , prisoners shall be treated as PoWs until such time as their status has been determined by a competent tribunal . While this Article does not specify the nature of the competent tribunal , Article 45 of the 1977 Geneva @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considerable leeway in the procedure by which a tribunal could reach such a decision . The possibilities that the proceedings could take place after a trial for an offence , and also in camera in the interest of state security , are not excluded . In US official manuals the general principle that Article 5 tribunals must be held is not contested . The US Army manual states unequivocally : When doubt exists as to whether captured enemy personnel warrant PW prisoner of war status , Art . 5 Tribunals must be convened . 45 <p> The fact that certain prisoners may be viewed as unlawful combatants , and may ( after a tribunal has so determined ) be denied PoW status , does not mean that they have no legal rights at all . A strong argument can be made that , whether or not they are formally entitled to such rights , they should have certain of the basic safeguards accorded to PoWs . Furthermore , Article 75 of the 1977 Geneva Protocol I elaborates a range of fundamental guarantees that are intended to provide minimum rules of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ favourable treatment under other rules . Any state with a claim to act legally in international relations , even if not itself a party to the 1977 Geneva Protocol I ( neither the US nor Afghanistan is a party ) , must take the rules in Article 75 seriously as the minimum standards , especially as these provisions are viewed as customary law . 46 <p> The United Kingdoms long engagement against terrorism in Northern Ireland provides one precedent for applying international rules to prisoners whose status is contested . While denying that there was an armed conflict whether international or otherwise , and strongly resisting any granting of PoW status to detainees and convicted prisoners , the UK did come to accept that international standards had to apply to their treatment . The UK Commission of Inquiry whose report in 1972 led to this conclusion is an interesting example of asserting the wider relevance , even in an internal conflict , of certain international legal standards , including some from the main body of the four 1949 Geneva Conventions . 47 <p> In 1967-68 , during the US involvement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cong main force and local force personnel , and certain Viet Cong irregulars , as PoWs . This was despite the existence of doubts and ambiguities as to whether these forces met all the criteria in Article 4 of the 1949 Geneva Convention III . However , there was a significant exception in respect of terrorism . Viet Cong irregulars were only to be classified as PoWs if captured while engaging in combat or a belligerent act under arms , other than an act of terrorism , sabotage , or spying . There was provision for establishing Article 5 tribunals to determine , in doubtful cases , whether individual detainees were entitled to PoW status . Those not entitled to such status were to be transferred to the South Vietnamese authorities . 48 <p> US policy regarding prisoners taken in Afghanistan appeared initially to leave only limited room for application of the rules of protection contained in the laws of war . By referring to these prisoners generally as battlefield detainees and unlawful combatants , the US signalled its unwillingness to classify al-Qaeda and Taliban prisoners as PoWs . On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have any access to the prisoners who had just been taken to the US naval base at Guantanamo Bay in Cuba , Rumsfeld stated : <p> I think that were in the process of sorting through precisely the right way to handle them , and they will be handled in the right way . They will be handled not as prisoners of war , because they 're not , but as unlawful combatants . The , as I understand it , technically unlawful combatants do not have any rights under the Geneva Convention . We have indicated that we do plan to , for the most part , treat them in a manner that is reasonably consistent with the Geneva Conventions , to the extent they are appropriate , and that is exactly what we have been doing . 49 <p> In the event , ICRC officials started interviewing detainees at Guantanamo on 18 January , and were able to establish a permanent presence there . On 22 January Rumsfeld , contrary to his earlier statement , recognised that under the Geneva Convention , an unlawful combatant is entitled to humane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in the first major policy statement on the issue , announced that Taliban prisoners were covered under Geneva Convention III , but al-Qaeda members were not . While neither group was accorded full PoW status , the White House gave detailed assurances about their treatment . <p> Two considerations contributed to the US determination not to classify as PoWs prisoners taken in Afghanistan : the first related to conditions of detention of prisoners , and the second to the conduct of judicial proceedings . On conditions of detention , the 1949 Geneva Convention III famously states that PoWs are only obliged to give name , rank , date of birth and personal or serial number . The US was anxious to obtain considerably more information from them , although whether a different classification actually improves the prospects of securing accurate information is debatable . As regards judicial proceedings , from early on in the war , the US reportedly intended to prosecute a number of al-Qaeda and Taliban leaders , including Osama bin Laden if captured . The US has been reluctant to pursue the procedure laid down in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a PoW must be by the same courts according to the same procedure as in the case of members of the armed forces of the Detaining Power. - 51 Such procedures , US officials feared , could provide opportunities for al-Qaeda suspects and their lawyers to prolong legal processes and attract publicity . There was also concern that in cases involving defendants with no documents and no willingness to collaborate with any of the procedures , and where evidence might be largely based on intelligence sources , it could be difficult to provide evidence that met high standards of admissibility , and equally high standards of proof of direct personal involvement in terrorist activities . Further , al-Qaeda might learn valuable information , for example , about its vulnerability to intelligence gathering , from evidence in open court . In addition , following the normal US military procedures for appeals was seen as posing problems . 52 <p> In certain other respects , too , there could be difficulties in treating some of the prisoners as normal PoWs . For example , a practice that is normally pursued after a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by three considerations . First , while the war in Afghanistan may be concluded at a definite date , it may be decades before the war on terror can be declared to be over for the US . Second , unlike PoWs in a normal inter-state war , the prisoners concerned might continue to be extremely dangerous after release , given their training and motivation to commit acts of terrorism . Third , their countries of origin might refuse to accept them back , except perhaps as prisoners . <p> President Bushs Military Order of 13 November 2001 provides for the option of trying certain accused terrorists by military commissions operating under special rules . It specifies that individual terrorists , including members of al-Qaeda , can be detained and tried for violations of the laws of war and other applicable laws , and that the military commissions would not be bound by the principles of law and the rules of evidence generally recognized in the trial of criminal cases in the United States district courts . It also contains some extremely brief provisions for humane conditions of detention , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regulations on such matters as the conduct of proceedings of the military commissions. - 53 The provision for trial by military commission is not unprecedented : for example , President Roosevelts Proclamation of 2 July 1942 , bluntly entitled Denying Certain Enemies Access to the Courts of the United States. - 54 On 30 November 2001 , the Presidents Counsel offered several assurances , including that such commissions are one option , but not the only option. - 55 Nevertheless , President Bushs Military Order remained the subject of considerable legal and political debate in the US and elsewhere as to its constitutionality , practicability and advisability . One test of the detailed regulations , which had not been issued at the time of writing , will be whether the procedures of the military commissions conform with the ten recognised principles of regular judicial procedure outlined in Article 75(4) of 1977 Geneva Protocol I. <p> Overall , the US handling of questions relating to the treatment and status of prisoners , especially those under Northern Alliance control , has caused widespread concern and criticism . The principles briefly indicated in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consistently followed , and practical arrangements , especially around the time of the rebellion at Mazar-e Sharif , were inadequate . Although many key US positions were defensible , especially that certain prisoners might not qualify for PoW status , aspects of US policy and procedures were poorly presented , and in some cases did not appear to be fully thought-out . The prisoner issue always sensitive anyway was especially significant in this war : if the coalition was perceived to have treated prisoners inhumanely , or to have regarded their status and treatment as being in an international legal limbo , there would be risks of a general weakening of the prisoner regime , including for any coalition personnel taken prisoner in the ongoing war on terrorism . The handling of this issue was a potential threat to coalition unity . The controversies over the prisoner question had a special resonance because of the concern of other countries that the US had been moving towards unilateralism generally , on a wide range of matters : in this perspective , fairly or unfairly , the US reluctance to accept the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to those particular prisoners was seen as one more example of a selective approach to international law . The White House statement of 7 February , while not answering all concerns , provided reassurance that US polices would follow provisions of the Geneva Conventions . <p> Conclusion <p> Bush administration policies on these laws-of-war issues have evolved in a generally sensible direction . However , neither the United States nor its critics have shown a clear understanding of how the laws of war should be applied to military counter-terrorist operations . This is in no small part because the application of those laws is complicated , as a return to the three questions set out at the beginning of this essay shows : <p> First , according to a strict interpretation of their terms , the main treaties relating to the conduct of international armed conflict are formally and fully applicable to anti-terrorist military operations only when those operations have an inter-state character . Where anti-terrorist operations have the character of civil war , the parties must apply , as a minimum , the rules applicable to civil wars . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and situations may well be different from what was envisaged in the main treaties on the laws of war . They may differ from the provisions for both international and non-international armed conflict . Recognising that there are difficulties in applying international rules in the special circumstances of anti-terrorist war , the attempt can and should nevertheless be made to apply the law to the maximum extent possible . This conclusion is reinforced by decisions of commissions of inquiry , a resolution of the UN Security Council , some practice of states and considerations of prudence . <p> Third , the great majority of prisoners taken in war meet the criteria for PoW status laid down in international treaties , and must be so treated if they continue to be held . However , in an anti-terrorist war , as in other wars , there are likely to be certain individuals who do not meet the criteria . Such individuals , for example , members of a terrorist organisation , may present special problems as prisoners , and may pose a continuing threat even after the end of a war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ US military manuals is that such people should be accorded the treatment , but not the status , of a PoW until a tribunal convened by the captor determines the status to which the individual is entitled . In cases where it is determined that they are not PoWs , there are certain fundamental rules applicable to their treatment , including those outlined in Article 75 of 1977 Geneva Protocol I. Any prisoner , whether or not classified as a PoW , can be tried for offences , including those against international law , that were committed prior to capture . <p> There are ample grounds for questioning whether military operations involving action against terrorists constitute either a new , or a wholly distinct , category of war . The coalition operations in Afghanistan , and the larger war against terrorism of which they are a part , are not completely unlike earlier wars . Many forms of military action and issues raised are similar to those in previous military operations , and concern issues addressed by the laws of war . <p> Events in Afghanistan have confirmed that there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anti-terrorist operations . A war that has as a fundamental purpose the pursuit and bringing to justice of people deemed to be criminals involves many awkward issues for which the existing laws of war are not a perfect fit . The use of proxies in an anti-terrorist war risks creating a situation in which major powers are at the mercy of their local agents , whose commitment to the laws of war may be slight . <p> Despite such problems , treating , or appearing to treat , the law in a cavalier manner risks creating new problems . If a major power is perceived as ignoring certain basic norms , this may have a negative effect in a coalition , or on enemies . It may also affect the conduct of other states in other conflicts . In that wider sense , the principle of reciprocity in the observance of law retains its value . <p> There has been no serious suggestion that the existing legal framework can or should be abandoned , and no proposals for alternative detailed rules . The existing laws of war , however imperfect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of war arise with great frequency in anti-terrorist military operations , and will no doubt continue to do so in the continuing war against terrorism , there is a need for greater clarity about observance of the basic laws of war , and about the principles to be followed if and when parties consider that specific circumstances justify specific derogations from that body of law . <p> Adam Roberts is Montague Burton Professor of International Relations at Oxford University and Fellow of Balliol College .

The MIRDG was asked to think about research on the costs and benefits of building mixed-income housing developments in American cities , the major thrust of housing policy in the United States since the mid-1990s . Although the committee was encouraged to inform itself and think hard about mixed-income developments such as those that have been built in Chicago as part of the HOPE VI project during the recent past , it was also encouraged to think broadly about the concept of income mixing , including both intentional and " naturally " occurring mixed-income housing in various times and places .

We deploy the concept of geography of death to investigate the multi-layered aspects of state-sanctioned lethal violence perpetrated by , but not limited to , the police force . This entails a consideration of at least three types of factor : actual violent acts , their symbolic dimensions and the historical and structural conditions within which violence emerges . Based on official data from the Brazilian state we argue that there is a perverse correlation between vulnerability to death and new racial formations , as they intersect with social class , age , gender , and place . Thus , the distinctive social geographies of Spo Paulo not only provide the context , but also define the very nature , frequency and experience of police violence . Ultimately , we argue , police lethality is a manifestation of the police and the state 's complicity in reproducing boundaries of privilege and exclusion . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Police Lethality and the Racialized Regimes of Citizenship in Sao Paulo

@@2741330 <p> Disciplinary retrospectives on American religious studies have come over the last several decades to center on a single turning point , a decisive and expansive reformation of the object of scholars ' attentions . In a nutshell , somewhere between the 1970s and 1980s a vanguard among us began at last to leave off writing about white , northeastern , Protestant men and to write instead about everybody : more religions , more relations to religion , more of what counts as religion in the first place . Even as it lies at the animating heart of our disciplinary self-appraisals , however , this narrative turn from Protestantism to pluralism in American religious studies seems itself peculiarly resistant to analysis . This essay proposes that we revisit the dialectic between oneness ' and manyness ' in American religious history and historiography . In particular , it urges that we bring scrutiny to bear on the ways that our newer narratives of religious pluralism in America come to be spliced within a more longstanding and resilient metanarrative rooted in American Protestantism . <p> What is the relationship between religious studies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to repudiate ecclesiastical traditions of history , making the difference between religious history and histories of religion a question of denominational rivalry more than a difference in sect . Scholars working in the academic study of religion and the academic study of history have increased self-consciousness of this contingency but have not developed an account for the consequence of history as the primary mode for our thinking . As a result , scholars of religion frequently fall silent in the wake of postcolonial critiques of religious subjects , believing their work is adequately buttressed when this history ( the history of the relationship between colonial oppression and religious classification ) is acknowledged . Yet this is only the beginning of our work . Religious history can not evade the methodological challenges of religious studies precisely because to identify an object as religious is to begin an inquiry into the subject of religion itself . Using the example of the year 1893 , the author seeks to demonstrate how scholars of history might justify their subjects as religious , and how scholars of religion might consider their concept of history . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

@@2741338 <h> The Immanent Frame <p> Attempts to define " evangelical " often hover between theological definitions from those who self-identify as evangelicals and so-called sociological definitions from those who take themselves to be observers of the phenomenon .

First , such theological definitions have a sort of centripetal force about them : they often feel like a conceptual circling of the wagons , intended to de-fine a group by marking off its differences from other groupsand usually from other Christians .

We have seen a flourishing dialogue between Catholics and evangelicals over the past decade , to the extent that Mark Noll and Carolyn Nystrom could jointly ask , " Is the Reformation Over ?

" Theological definitions of evangelicalism assume that there is something about being " evangelical " that is different from being " Catholic , " an older , more ecumenical label that was meant to indicate a commitment to a certain core orthodoxy ( as when St. Augustine the preacher would admonish his congregation , " Remember , you are Catholic " ) . <p> This first concern about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such definitions are sometimes too narrow , they can also be too broad . For instance , if someone suggests a theological definition of " evangelical " which actually could include Roman Catholics , then one has to wonder just what work the term " evangelical " really does . This tension came to a head when Joshua Hochschild , a convert to Rome , could not remain employed by Wheaton College because the colleges " evangelical " statement of faith was taken to de facto exclude Roman Catholics , despite Hochschilds assertion that a Catholic could affirm the statements primacy of Scripture . If " evangelicals " can be Roman Catholic , we have to wonder why the historic term " Catholic " couldnt do the same definitional work . So attempts to broaden " evangelical " to include Roman Catholics fail for this reason . <p> But there is another kind of vague breadth in recent theological definitions of " evangelicalism " that concerns menamely , the demographic sleight of hand that enfolds Pentecostals , charismatics , and the explosion of " world Christianity " under the label @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ covert conceptual colonialism at work here , which lumps vibrant expressions of faith in other parts of the world together with the revivalism behind North American and British evangelicalism . This is painting with a very broad theological brush indeed ; worse still , it paints over important differences in practice and implicit theology that serve as more significant identity markers in Christian expressions like Nigerian Pentecostalism . Theological definitions of evangelicalism are , we might say , poorly calibrated : they see certain theological similarities and conclude that were seeing the same phenomenon . But I 'm suggesting that this is a poor theoretical filter ; or rather , we might say that it is a poor theoretical net . Designed to catch " evangelical " fish , it assumes that any fish that get through must be evangelicals . But I would suggest that what " defines " global Pentecostalism is a set of practicesand a tacit theology within themwhich is quite different from the Euro-American " evangelical " paradigm . <p> For these reasons and others , I find myself both skeptical and suspicious of theological definitions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which assumes that the doctrinal markers of evangelical Protestantismmarking it off from other Christian traditionsare something worth celebrating and preserving . I think such distinctions and divisions are lamentable . In our secular ( or post-secular ) culture , wed do better to encourage all Christians to see themselves as " Catholic " rather than continue to assert a sub-Christian identity . <p> But does that mean that evangelicalism is left as a free-floating signifier , an empty term that tells us nothing ? I do n't  think so . Rather , I think it leaves us with something like a sociological definition of evangelicalism . On such an account , what defines " evangelicalism " is not some sort of direct link to the essence of the Gospel ( behind most theological definitions of evangelicalism is some sense that " we " are the real Christians ) , but rather an appreciation that evangelicalism represents a contingent style , a sort of accent within Christendom . It is not simply a " recovery " of the so-called essence of the Gospel and the New Testament church . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contingent , particular , and geographically situated . It is a distinctly modern , post-Reformation configuration of Christian discipleship that engendered practices and institutions which closely mirrored the development of what Charles Taylor describes as " the modern social imaginary " a focus on individual salvation , a valorization of the autonomy of the local congregation , an entrepreneurial spirit that fueled ambitious programs of church and parachurch expansion , a kind of Christian materialism that generated its own markets , and other distinctive features . <p> What I mean to suggest is that " evangelicalism " is defined by a contingent constellation of practices and institutions that elude theological formulation or definition . This is why I think a sociological definition of evangelicalism is the only viable option . Admittedly , this approach can seem a little fuzzy , on the order of " it takes one to know one . " But here again , Taylor might help us to get a handle on why this is the case : if evangelicalism is not a theology but an imaginary , then that means what " defines " it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Instead , " evangelicalism " would be a sort of ethos , a sensibility , a contingent set of practices and institutions within which one lives and moves and has her being . " Evangelical " is an identity forged at a level more visceral than doctrinal . <p> It is in this sociological sense that I own up to being an evangelical , despite all my theological reservations . I still pick up Christianity Today before I pick up the Christian Century or First Things . I get the jokes , jabs , and sly references in the orbit of conservative Protestantism . Ive taken friends to a Billy Graham crusade and still revere Nonconformist saints like Jim Elliot and Corrie ten Boom . I know the words to Michael W. Smiths " Friends are Friends Forever " ( sung when departing every Bible camp ) , as well as all the words to Keith Greens anthems . I still understand the inner workings and issues of evangelicalism better than the labyrinthine machinations of American liberalism or Catholicism . I still feel at home in evangelical circlesif you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a small town Thanksgiving dinner , with all its charm and awkwardness , all its arguments and hugs . <p> For theological reasons , I think even we who self-identify as evangelicals ought to embrace the contingency and historicity of a sociological definition . But even such sociological definitions will need to be better calibrated to the on-the-ground shape of lived religion in evangelicalism . Social scientists observing evangelicalism will want to avoid the red herrings of theological definitions without ignoring the implicit theologythe social imaginarythat is " carried " in the habits and practices of evangelicals . For that reason , I do think there is a sense in which " it takes one to know one ; " if evangelicals can put aside their inclination toward theological definitions , they might become critical partners for a more nuanced sociological definition of evangelicalism . <p> This entry was posted on Friday , August 15th , 2008 at 11:22 am and is @ @ @ @ @ 9 Responses to " Who 's afraid of sociology ? " <p> 1 ) The theological definitions are deceptively broad ( to which I say , narrow them ! Pentecostalism should not be seen as a subset of evangelicalism in any case ) . <p> and <p> 2 ) You do n't  like celebrating theological distinctives , or , perhaps , you are embarassed by the claimed theological distinctives of evangelicalism ( to which I say , does evangelicalism not have something THEOLOGICAL to say , that Catholicism and liberalism wont or cantbut shouldsay ? ) <p> It seems to me that to allow this sociological definition is to concede the theological ground somewhat , which would be a shame . You can have the theological definition without the abuses you mention . <p> " Theological definitions of evangelicalism assume that there is something about being evangelical that is different from being Catholic , an older , more ecumenical label that was meant to indicate a commitment to a certain core orthodoxy ( as when St. Augustine the preacher would admonish his congregation , Remember , you are Catholic ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think your evangelicalism probably prevents your from seeing through sociological eyes . Defining catholicism theologically as " a commitment to a certain core orthodoxy " sounds awfully Protestant . If you want to try and get into the mindset of catholicism as a sociological ideal type , you might look at the work of David Tracy and his distinction of the dialectical imagination of Augustinian religions , predominately though not exclusively Protestant , and the analogical imagination , predominately though not exclusively Catholic . A more accessible and sociological appropriation of this model has been provided by Andrew Greeleys many works on the Catholic imagination . <p> Both good comments to help me hone what is an admittedly fuzzy post , meant to articulate an intuition more than lay out a thesis . Let me say a couple of things in reply : <p> Ad Jensen : Youre certainly right that the " culture " of evangelicalism emerged from what was a decidedly theological identity , viz. , a robust Protestantism ( which often saw the magisterial Reformation as not going far enough ) . This often and usually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or found expression in the concern that one has " a personal relationship with Jesus . " In either case , there is a noted emphasis on personal , individual salvation as an interior work . This has at least two consequences : first , it means that , for evangelicals , there IS salvation outside the church ; or , in other words , the community that is the ecclesia does not mediate salvation in any way . Instead , church is a kind of encouragement club for saved individuals . Second , this thin ecclesiology has usually been attended by a suspicion of " external " matters of ritual , liturgy , and the sacraments , as well as a general disparaging of that long period between " the New Testament Church " and the Reformation . ( Surely one of the most notable and encouraging developments in evangelical theology over the past ten years has been a renewed interest in the Church Fathers and even medieval theology . ) <p> So what ? My concern , I guess , is that evangelicalism as a theological identity affirms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way that construes them as the only way to think about Christian faith , and does so in a way that implicitly or explicitly disparages the Catholic theological tradition . In short , I have second thoughts about the Reformation for what , in evangelical-speak , I think are " biblical " reasons . <p> Perhaps this is just a long , rambling way of trying to say that I 'm a reluctant Protestant whereas most who are ardent supporters of a theological definition of evangelicalism are often quite enthusiastic Protestants . But nonetheless , I know where I come from , recognize how my imagination has been shaped , and own up to the fact that I am " evangelical " in terms of my ( sociological ) formation . <p> Ad Coverston : Very fair point . You 're right ; I regrettably fell into an old evangelical habit ( thus proving my point ! = by fixating on the doctrinal . In fact , I 've just finished a book that makes a case for not doing this . Instead , like you suggest , I argue that " the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liturgical practices that form our imaginations before its ever articulated in doctrines ( see George Weigels wonderful little book , Letters to a Young Catholic on this point ) . I hope you can see this already in the post when I suggest that we ought to focus on the " implicit " theology that is carried in evangelical practices . <p> I think the problem with Smiths comparison of " evangelical " to " Catholic " is not his theological characterization of Catholic identity in itself . He quite clearly references Augustine , conjuring up memory of the Donatist controversy of North Africa where Catholic identity was most certainly concerned with theological orthodoxy , or at least the ecclesial matrix within which that orthodoxy could be obtained ( and such an ecclesiological standard is n't really " sociological , " at least not in Augustine and not as Smith uses the term here ) . So this doctrinal focus is n't distinctively evangelical as opposed to Catholic . <p> But that brings us to where I think Smith might have erred somewhat in his evangelical/Catholic comparison . Are evangelicals really intending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Smith references the " older , more ecumenical " one ? the one that Augustine preaches ? I do n't  think so . That evangelicals might try to distinguish evangelicalism from post-Reformation " Catholic " identity is more on the mark , but then , as Coverston points out , in looking at this Catholicism we lose the very doctrinal focus that Augustine can provide in identifying the catholic . <p> Whether evangelicalism recovers Augustines sense is another questioncertainly it tries , and perhaps the annoyingly broad theological definitions of evangelicalism are somewhat redeemed by the fact that what they 're attempting is a sort of catholicity . That they attempt this from denominational or sectarian beginnings ( sociological or theological , call them what you will ) obviously makes such an attempt a difficult sell to the non-evangelical , just as catholicity can be a difficult sell to the evangelical herself . <p> I came here from Digby through Beliefnet 's Progressive Revival blog ( which is a long journey ! ) . So I 'm not going to talk about St. Augustine . <p> You 've put your finger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trying to convey to my non-Evangelical friends for years . Being an Evangelical in the U.S. , in the late 20th-early 21st century , involves more than theology . It is also a lifestyle . <p> As an amateur sociologist ( are n't we all ? ) , my concept of the relationship between the theological and the sociological is something like this : The theological definition provides a floor " you can not be admitted to the Evangelical club without being able to affirm something like the seven beliefs listed in the Evangelical Manifesto , out loud , in front of people . But that is n't enough . You also have to join the sociologically defined group , which requires adopting certain folkways , patterns of speech , dress , habits , activities and so on . Because these sociological markers are more visible to others than theological commitments , they become a shorthand way to recognize other Evangelicals , used both by Evangelicals themselves and by outsiders . As I know from my own history as a former Evangelical , failing to adopt these folkways is every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true Christian as standing up in the middle of the 11:00 service and expressing doubts about the Trinity would be . <p> At the same time , these sociological markers are an outgrowth of the baseline theological beliefs , although not a necessary outgrowth . In other words , if you become an Evangelical in the middle of a forest with no one to hear ( except God ! ) , do you really become an Evangelical , even if you sign on to the Evangelical Manifesto ? The new Evangelical , sitting alone in the forest , would n't necessarily come up with the same sociological markers as did his or her Evangelical counterparts back at the megachurch . The lone Evangelical wo n't spontaneously start listening to Keith Green ( he 's from my era , too ) or today 's equivalent . On the other hand , I think the lone Evangelical would start setting up some structure , or test , or marker , to help determine Who is on the Lord 's Side and who is n't . <p> Of course , one danger of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , believing themselves able to tell who is really a Christian through the outward manifestations , even over the protests of the person himself or herself . I see both Barrack Obama at Saddleback and Joshua Hochschild at Wheaton as running afoul of this Evangelical clairvoyance . And , unless the congregation were in a very generous mood , a Pentecostal believer from Nigeria would face some serious doubts of both the theological and sociological kind were he or she to be plunked down in the middle of an American Evangelical church . <p> So I agree that you can not ignore the sociological element of the definition , but I think it is bound up with the theological , to the point that it is very difficult to separate the two . <p> One of the tings a sociological approach like this might accomplish is not the elimination of theological criteria , but the broadening of what we mean by theological . As a modern movement , evangelicalism is prone to the modern reduction of theology to the propositional . Even if one concedes to all the propositions held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , that is an impoverished version of the faith that will not sustain itself across the generations if even in the life of a single person . <p> Adding in a sociological component might allow us to see what evangelicals want to do in light of Billy Abrahams Canonical Theism project , a recovery of non-propositional elements of the faith that make it truly sustainable . <p> " There is another kind of vague breadth in recent theological definitions of evangelicalism that concerns menamely , the demographic sleight of hand that enfolds Pentecostals , charismatics , and the explosion of world Christianity under the label evangelical . ' " <p> James , in your critique of a too broad definition of evangelicalism , I wonder how you would define Pentecostalism from a sociological perspective . Is there a Pentecostal style that is distinct from what you describe as evangelical ? <p> The trend toward generalization is not just a theological phenomenon . Across all social spectra , specific groups are co-opting tangentially related designations for their own purposes . The larger movement we see where new groups arise and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I find personally fascinating . <p> Well , I guess Im three years too late to this party , and doubtless other more recent posts have covered related ground . That said : <p> This particular post emphasizes evangelicalism primarily in opposition to Roman Catholicism . That was doubtless true in the 17th-19th centuries . However , the internal schism in American Protestantism in the 20th Century resulted in a refocusing of evangelicalism as the conservative alternative to the liberal theological strains which overtook the mainline Protestant denominations . The dispute with Roman Catholicism , while still very much alive , shrank to secondary importance in comparison . <h> Leave a Reply <p> Please note : All comments will be approved by an administrator before they appear on this page .

An anthropologist of education , she examines ongoing ( and intergenerational ) disputes over difference , discrimination , and inequality in both school and community settings . Her first book , Colormute : Race Talk Dilemmas in an American School , was published in 2004 . As a fellow at the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study in 2004-5 , Pollock is writing a second book on struggles over racial injustice in U.S. education , entitled Toward Everyday Justice : Disputing Educational Discrimination in the New Civil Rights Era .

Photos of blond and petite Corrie , taken during the incident by fellow twentysomething nonviolent activists in the International Solidarity Movement ( ISM ) , which Corrie had joined for her work in Palestine , showed her standing high on a pile of dirt in front of the American-made Caterpillar bulldozer . A small figure in a fluorescent jacket holding a bullhorn , she sat down momentarily to stop the bulldozer and then stood high on the dirt pile and looked the bulldozer 's driver in the eye . The bulldozer did n't stop . It ran her over , pinning her under the mound of dirt ; it then reversed without lifting its blade and ran over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a local hospital , she died from a crushed chest and skull , joining the hundreds of young Palestinians and scores of young Israelis killed throughout the Israeli military and settler occupation that she and other ISMers had come to challenge . <p> What is remarkable about Corrie 's story is not the untimely death of a young person in the region . Youth have been major victims of violence on both sides , and youth have also been primarily responsible for these youth deaths in many cases : both Israeli soldiers and Palestinian suicide bombers are disproportionately young , as are many of the most violent Israeli settlers . What is most remarkable about Corrie 's story is that as an American young person , she felt a personal responsibility for Palestinian human rights strong enough to make her voluntarily put herself in harm 's way in the first place-and that a transnational nonviolent movement of Palestinians and " internationals " had drawn her to do this . <p> Since ISM 's inception , nearly three thousand international activists -- the majority from Europe and North America , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so far , the ISM has not accepted members under 18 ) -have been drawn through ISM 's informal , email-based global network to use their " privilege " in " solidarity " with Palestinians demonstrating on the ground in Palestine , and to then go home to " tell Palestinians ' story " of life under occupation to the world community . ISM is one example of a transnational political phenomenon in which critiques of the human rights violations of the Israeli occupation are developing and circulating globally . Further , young American ISMers in particular-people who , I find , come to analyze the occupation as a human rights problem worth intervening in personally-suggest more broadly that various youth today might be learning to " think globally , act globally " about a growing number of social problems . <p> ISM internationals like Corrie go to Palestine in person because the possibility of harm to foreign , international , American , European , and disproportionately white bodies-adjectives that , in this context , all imply privilege-participating with Palestinians in demonstrations against the occupation is expected to stay the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Demonstrators like Corrie are also expected to be more likely than Palestinians to get the violence of occupation itself noticed by home governments , and further shine the spotlight of the outside world on those Palestinians resisting the occupation nonviolently . As one of the movement 's founders explained , " ISM can help support the nonviolent Palestinian resistance by tapping into the resource that internationals can provide-global attention " ( Stohlman and Aladin 2003 , 75 ) . ISM activists thus explicitly attempt to wield the privilege embodied in their non-Palestinian status to enable both Palestinian survival and the growth of a Palestinian nonviolent movement , long overshadowed by a violent Palestinian minority and stunted by the Israeli violence of occupation itself . Indeed , ISM exemplifies a self-conscious transnational activist strategy of putting white , international , and , in many cases , American privilege explicitly to work for social change . <p> As I describe in the full version of this article , one aspect of ISM work most central to ISMers themselves is the movement 's complex use of privilege : the dynamics of privilege @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motivate and plague some of the movement 's younger American participants . In fieldwork conducted with and among a subset of young U.S. activists , I found that activists striving by definition to work in horizontal solidarity with Palestinians worried regularly and openly about the dynamics of unequal power embedded in the very project of transporting their privileged bodies to Palestine for use as a nonviolent political tool . ISM 's international members quite self-consciously utilize and actively reject the privilege of their birth- worrying all the while how this paradox both undergirds and challenges their ongoing activity . ISM , which employs international privileges of mobility , nation-based citizenship , wealth , and personal safety even while its members strive continually to be a " Palestinian-led " solidarity movement , is troubled by the very dynamics of privilege that make the work possible . International ISM activists know well that they both defy and utilize a global inequality in measurements of human worth . As one young white activist put it to me bluntly after her return , having " white , Western , Americans there-it made a difference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The International Solidarity Movement : background <p> In 2001 , the ISM was put in motion by a simple email call from a small coalition of Palestinian and foreign activists living in Palestine-many in their twenties-who had realized collectively that the participation of visibly non-Palestinian people in Palestinian nonviolent demonstrations against the occupation seemed to enable those demonstrations to take place without a violent Israeli military response . From its inception , the ISM built its work upon a little-known legacy of nonviolent Palestinian resistance to Israel 's 40-year military occupation and settlement of the West Bank and Gaza Strip . Palestinians in the Occupied Territories have long participated in marches and sit-ins to defy Israeli military and settlement actions , sometimes along with activist Israeli groups ; Palestinians have also tried nonviolent strategies of tax resistance and curfew/checkpoint refusal ( Kuttab 2001 ; Andoni et al 2003 ) , and have at times orchestrated resignations from the Israeli bureaucracy to disable the architecture of occupation ( Nusseibeh 2005 ) . Younger Palestinians have also employed nonviolent resistance tactics , such as flying kites during curfew , breaking curfew to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and protests ( Stohlman and Aladin 2003 ) . Throughout , however , Palestinians have often been shot at or tear-gassed by Israeli soldiers when demonstrating nonviolently alone . Citing security concerns , Israel has also exiled many Palestinian nonviolent organizers ( Jawad Saleh 2003 ) . <p> In spring 2001 , several successful nonviolent Palestinian demonstrations involving American exchange students , Israelis , and European NGO workers living in the region convinced Palestinian organizers that having visibly non-Palestinian participants along actually seemed to protect Palestinian demonstrators from Israeli military fire . These non-Palestinian participants were literally called " internationals " to distinguish them from participating Palestinians ; at another demonstration at this time " without internationals , " one of ISM 's Palestinian founders later told a Boston audience , 13 Palestinians had been killed . Activists began an email campaign to actively recruit international visitors to join Palestinian nonviolent resistance activities . The goal of the newly labeled International Solidarity Movement was to harness visitors ' so-called international privilege to support ongoing nonviolent organizing among Palestinians and to foster additional energy for " direct action " activism among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As one Israeli ISM founder , Neta Golan , put it in a public engagement in Boston , " our commitment is to keep the venue for nonviolent resistance open with our presence . " A U.S. founder , Palestinian American Huwaida Arraf , told me in an interview that an exhausted older Palestinian activist had told her that such spectacular nonviolent freedom demonstrations now had to be carried forth by the " young and na+ve . " <p> The invitation to international participants to come do nonviolent direct actions in solidarity with Palestinians against the occupation , Arraf noted , was a move both ideologically committed to fostering a new global energy for ending the occupation and tactically pragmatic in wielding international privilege to support nonviolent Palestinian demonstrations . ISM 's tactics expanded specifically upon previous Palestinian- spearheaded work toward an international witness corps , the Grassroots International Protection for Palestinians ( GIPP ) campaign , which had for years brought visitors ( primarily from Italy , France , and Spain ) to accompany and observe work in Palestine ( Andoni et al 2003 ) . As one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " more tour-like , less direct action-less likely to do clearing of roadblocks . " Arraf told me that ISM 's organizers hoped that a new presence of international activists actually participating in nonviolent Palestinian civil disobedience would simultaneously enable a full-fledged Palestinian nonviolent movement , foster a new global participant energy for ending the occupation through nonviolent demonstrations , and build international pressure to end the occupation through the global circulation of visitors ' eyewitness reports . <p> In spearheading ISM 's attempts to harness international privilege , Arraf , a woman from Michigan in her late twenties who was living and working in Ramallah , joined with age-mate Golan , a Jewish Israeli activist , under the counsel of both young and veteran Palestinian organizers from the Palestinian Center for Rapprochement Between Peoples in Beit-Sahour , an organization with a history of organizing nonviolent resistance and Palestinian-Israeli cross-cultural efforts . Arraf quickly brought in to the ranks of ISM leadership her husband Adam Shapiro , a Jewish American in his early 30s whom she had originally met in Jerusalem working for the Maine-based Seeds of Peace youth dialogue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arraf and her colleagues emailed various activist groups they knew , asking readers to " come join Palestinians in two weeks of nonviolent action " with ISM . This email brought to Palestine about 50 people , mainly from the U.S. and the UK , as well as Italy and France . ISM 's first campaign in December 2001 involved sit-downs at Israeli military roadblocks and checkpoints , and marches in which several hundred Palestinians and a small core of ISMers confronted soldiers in a human chain of arm-linked bodies . As hoped , the presence of internationals indeed seemed to keep Israeli soldiers from firing . Emboldened , ISM 's email calls to action continued . In the summer of 2002 , hundreds of ISM international volunteers-many in their twenties , many on summer vacations from college-descended on Palestine in an action notably called " Freedom Summer " in honor of the U.S. civil rights movement 's legacy of nonviolent inter-group solidarity . Some ISMers came monitored by quickly assembled hometown support networks ; many others came alone . Most came from Europe and the U.S. That summer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passengers with their presence . In fall 2002-3 , several hundred activists traveled to Palestine in an ISM " Olive Harvest Campaign " to protect Palestinian farmers harvesting their olives from settler violence . By ISM 's third Freedom Summer ( 2004 ) , actions included a three-week march of Palestinians , internationals and Israelis along the " security fence " from Jenin to Jerusalem . <p> ISM is a strikingly physical form of transnational activism , even though a large part of ISM work involves ISMers typing email from Palestinian internet cafes and showing slides upon return home . While activists in other movements , networks , or organizations sign web petitions or send letters or money across the borders of nations to solve social problems , ISM activists transport themselves to place themselves between Israeli soldiers and settlers and Palestinian civilians , having become convinced that protecting the human rights and enabling the nonviolent demonstrations of this geographically distant population is the activists ' own particular kind of power as well as their personal responsibility . Meanwhile , activists in their hometowns and states monitor their activities transnationally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ media work . The ISM network , which links activists on the ground in Palestine to activists at home ready to spring into action the moment a call or e-mail for help arrives , exemplifies current and growing trends of self-consciously transnational activism . In such activism , transnational coalitions of people leap national boundaries virtually and physically to participate together in actions designed to solve social problems conceived as a transnational responsibility . And in such activism , the world 's young people are playing increasingly central roles . <h> Transnational youth activism : a framing <p> In a larger research project entitled " Global Youth , Global Justice " ( GYGJ ) , I am working to discover trends in how young people are currently utilizing transnational partnerships to solve social problems nonviolently ; this quest led me originally to ISM . ISM is by definition a " transnational advocacy network , " as its members link up both inside and outside their nations of origin . While such networks have recently received a fair amount of attention , researchers have yet to focus on how young people-from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ current forms of self-consciously transnational activism . While not all young people in transnational movements identify strongly as " youth " activists ( as it turned out , most younger ISMers identified with the anti-occupation cause rather than with their age cohort ) , it seems to be the case empirically that these movements capitalize particularly on the available time , mobility , communication savvy , and excitement about things global that characterize the population of people increasingly labeled " youth " worldwide . <p> Youth actors are often depicted as the world 's most spectacularly global citizens due to the increasingly global circulation and consumption of youth products and ( desired ) lifestyles . Young people indeed seem particularly excited to think and act globally about fashion or leisure activity , but they are also increasingly central participants in transnational circulations of analyses , information , and strategies for addressing a broad range of social problems . My study of the ISM is part of the broader GYGJ project to track a global circulation to and by diverse youth of analyses of injustice . This project leaves open for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to think and act globally to solve social problems-and how the dynamics of racialized and national-origin privilege affect such global action . <p> Young activists may also now be key circulators of self-consciously nonviolent problem-solving tactics often ignored by researchers and in the media . Youth have already been shown to play key roles in violent transnational political activity ; young people from all social backgrounds ( though especially the poor ) are disproportionately recruited or forced by adults to participate in militias , armies , or guerrilla movements fighting across the borders of nations or proto-nations . Young people seem to get the most attention when they break windows or hurl homemade explosives in demonstrations . Yet while observers often equate young global justice activists with such " performative violence " ( Juris 2004a ) , this overlooks trends of self-consciously anti-violent transnational activism among the world 's youth , a version of activism of which ISM is a particularly explicit example . <p> Today 's transnational activism involving young participants might be classified along four axes in which activists analyze a diverse range of problems , address those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manners , and organize themselves through diverse organizational structures that exhibit varying levels of adult influence . First , transnational activists analyze different social problems , framing some problems literally as concerns threatening the entire world ( like the environment , AIDS , or the Israeli-Palestinian conflict ) and others as local problems created through global flows or political/corporate influence ( like a sweatshop or the troubles of specific Palestinian villages under occupation ) . Some youth activists organize around a generational consciousness as " youth " , while others ( like ISMers ) organize intergenerationally around specific social problems or cohere around other social identifications ( for example , in interviews many American ISMers identified most strongly as Americans , and as people thus responsible for U.S. support for the Israeli occupation ; some identified strongly as American Jews or Christians ) . <p> Second , young transnational activists often share , transnationally , a variety of ideas for activist activities for addressing these social problems . Spectacular anti-globalization protests are only one form of today 's transnational youth activism : some young people write emails or post to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still others share artistic performance . Tactically , ISMers " on the ground " self-consciously model nonviolent tactics from India , South Africa , and the U.S. ( such as marching and sit-ins ) and intertwine these tactics with ongoing Palestinian tactics of nonviolent resistance ( picking olives , camping upon farmlands slated for takeover ) . Back at home , ISMers raise money , publish reports , and recruit new delegates to Palestine to continue their efforts to end the occupation . Third , activists link themselves transnationally in different spatial manners . Some transnational activists ( like ISM ) attempt literally to link the entire globe , while others attempt to link just two or more nations . Some activists ( like ISM internationals ) move their bodies to single sites to participate in activism with peers , while other activists travel to fixed or changing sites for conferences and still others ( like ISM support groups ) stay put and facilitate the transnational transfer of knowledge via the Internet or telephone . <p> Finally , the ISM 's organizational structure-a porous , loose , intergenerational community of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decisions in Palestine through small affinity groups-is a good example of the kind of transnational activism that is self-consciously informal and anti-hierarchical . Other activist communities involving young people exist as more formal youth-run organizations , or even as corporate or government-sanctioned spinoffs of adult-run organizations designed for youth participation . As Fox ( 2000 ) and others indicate , every such movement , coalition , and network offers a different version of activism , varying in ideologies , tactics , political cultures , and internal cohesion . <p> While theorists of globalization have often focused on people of all ages experiencing globalization-either experiencing the networks of moving objects , ideas , and people central to globalization , orexperiencing the inequalities undergirding it- young activists in transnational political movements are self-consciously analyzing and redirecting globalization as well . For example , ISMers explicitly analyze the occupation as a phenomenon created through transnational processes , and thus best solved through orchestrated transnational action . Accordingly , they pursue self-consciously transnational activist tactics , creating networks for transporting ideas , people , and activist activity between nations and figuring out how to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these transnational networks . ISM activists are thus not only using the analytic , communication and travel networks made possible by globalization-they also are actively conceptualizing and creating networks for solving social problems within a globalizing world system . By coming to analyze and address the occupation transnationally as a shared social problem , ISMers are capitalizing upon a " think globally , act globally " mentality of globalization , rather than promoting the insular ethnocentrisms that are also often a response to globalization . <p> Of course , in hoping that their citizenship will halt Israeli soldier or settler violence , ISMers also prove that the notion of globalization should not imply the demise of the concept or the reality of nations . Indeed , transnational political activism is often actually built upon " fundamentally national social and civic organizations " ( Fox 2000 , 1 ) . ISMers join , as U.S. citizens or British citizens or Swedes , a community of internationals who , as one activist put it , have " passports as their weapons . " In critiquing the Israeli occupation , further , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Still , while utilizing the notion of nation to empower both themselves and ( they hope ) Palestinians , ISMers frame their activism self-consciously as global-not just because they are linking transnational actors , but also because they are claiming the Israeli-Palestinian conflict as a world responsibility . As Huwaida Arraf put it explicitly , " internationals can help globalize our struggle-we believe it 's a global one ... Internationals are coming to link arms with us and say ' it 's a global struggle for peace and justice , and everyone who believes in peace and justice can join . ' " <p> That ISM internationals transport themselves physically to place themselves in front of bulldozers and tanks suggests a level of political commitment dwarfing that of young people who write letters or raise money or march at home to solve social problems at home or abroad . But of course , the young Americans and Europeans who dominate ISM 's ranks are also perhaps disproportionately endowed with the travel funds and mobility to conduct spectacular transnational campaigns that , like the ISM , require temporary physical movement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ internationals " by some ISMers explaining the movement ) are also far more likely than their peers worldwide to be connected to the Internet , even while Palestinian-founded movements like ISM and " The Electronic Intifada " ( in which Palestinians report on life under occupation from web-linked sites in the Territories ) demonstrate that the Internet is by no means a medium utilized only by the economically privileged ( El Fassed 2003 ) . Finally , young Americans ( like Rachel Corrie herself ) are perhaps disproportionately more able than youth elsewhere to be seen conducting transnational activism--that is , to play spectacular roles that go publicly recognized in the West . While political ideas about transnational responsibility for social problems might flow multidirectionally to and from the West ( as stressed in ISM presentations , the original idea for ISM emanated from Palestine ) , ISM members ' continuous struggle to publicize ongoing Palestinian nonviolent activism rather than just their own indicates that the political power to be seen coordinating transnationally to solve a social problem is often not equally distributed . Further , as I discuss elsewhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ activities in Palestine-regarding issues as basic as who should be " in front " during direct actions , or who should suggest such actions in the first place-raises the key question of when and whether more global activism by the privileged actually serves those who must remain local . <h> Conclusion <p> The phenomenon of international young people wielding their privilege to challenge the occupation through nonviolent activism in Palestine is a striking demonstration of these activists ' analysis of transnational responsibility-and sense of personal power . Globalization research focused on youth tends to view them as particularly disempowered by transnational flows ; scholars have suggested that with the international circulation of images of consumables comes a clash of " possible worlds " ( Appadurai 1991 ) for young people , who drown in a sea of desires for impossible lives or flail as sudden " nobodies " in a global system that erodes local systems of meaning ( Leichty 1995 , Fong 2004 ) . In the case of youth political networks , however , globalization can mean the global connection of young people committed to an ideology of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instead to the sense of actually being " somebody " able to change the course of world events . <p> Whatever one thinks of young American ISMers ' actions or intentions-and whether or not one believes their efforts to act in nonviolent solidarity with Palestinians serve well the Palestinian cause-in a world in which violence has often seemed the most common strategy for conducting international relations , and in which members of more powerful nations often seek unabashedly to dominate those less powerful , young activists struggling to collaborate horizontally across national borders to solve problems of social inequality nonviolently are striking . The violent treatment of nonviolent youth in this crisis-countless murdered young Palestinians , young Israeli civilian victims of suicide bombings , ISM members themselves , and even high school Israeli " refusniks " imprisoned for refusing to serve in the occupation-makes this youthful commitment to nonviolence all the more poignant . What these young activists themselves want and would have wanted , it seems , is that violent harm befalling nonviolent activists of all national origins will galvanize public outrage against violence in a new way .

@@2741361 <h> Networks of Dissent : Islamism and Reform in Saudi Arabia <p> Gwenn Okruhlik <p> The following essay will be forthcoming in Current History . Our thanks to the editors for allowing the essay to appear here . <p> The politics of Islamist dissent in Saudi Arabia have come under intense scrutiny since September 11 . This is hardly surprising . Osama bin Laden is Saudi Arabian by birth and upbringing . Suspicion existed for some time that Saudis , both private citizens and public officials , had sent financial assistance to bin Laden after his exile to Taliban-ruled Afghanistan . Saudi Arabia was one of only three states ( along with Pakistan and the United Arab Emirates ) to recognize the Taliban as Afghanistans legitimate government . Perhaps most alarmingly , 15 of the 19 September 11 hijackers were Saudi Arabian citizens . <p> Ties between the events of September 11 and Saudi Arabia reinforce the need for serious reform in the kingdom . Political , economic , and social problems in the country have provided a fertile field for dissent dissent that can no longer be managed from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manner , the attraction of the radical flank of Islamists is likely to diminish in the presence of credible alternatives . But if serious structural reforms are not implemented , the call from the most radical flank will almost certainly find an audience among the population . <p> The internal and external grievances of the Islamists resonate broadly . The former involve authoritarianism and repression , maldistribution and inequity , the absence of representation in the political system , and the seemingly permanent stationing of United States military forces in Saudi Arabia . The latter involve American backing of Israel , United States-led sanctions on Iraq , and American support for repressive regimes in the region , particularly Saudi Arabia , Egypt , Algeria , and Jordan . <p> Contentious politics in general and social movements with Islamist lineages in particular are a significant part of the landscape of the contemporary Middle East . The Saudi case is especially interesting because Islamist movements , even under the constraints of an authoritarian political system , have been able to forge effective , amorphous underground networks throughout the country . We have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might mean for the future of the country and its ruling family , the al-Saud . A start is to understand the historical context , inner workings , and impact of the Islamist movement in Saudi Arabia . <p> Al-Sauds Authority <p> The al-Saud base their claim to legitimacy on the success of military conquests in the 1920s and 1930s and on their alliance with religious authorities . The al-Saud rule in an uneasy symbiosis with the Muslim clergy . This relationship dates to the 1744 alliance between Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab and Muhammad ibn Saud , a sort of merger of religious legitimacy and military might . The descendants of al-Wahhab still dominate the official religious institutions of the country . The official clergy regularly issue fatawa ( religious judicial opinions ) that justify the policies of the al-Saud in Islamic vocabulary , even when the policies are deplored in the populace ( the clergy , for example , issued a fatwa to justify the presence of United States troops during the Persian Gulf war ) . <p> Islam remains a double-edged sword for the al-Saud . It grants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constrains their behavior to that which is compatible with religious law . When family members deviate from that straight path , they are open to criticism since the regimes " right to rule " rests largely on the alliance with the al-Wahhab family . Today , the " alliance " between the regime and the official clergy is much contested by dissidents because the two groups no longer serve as checks on each other : the official clergy is said to be dependent on the al-Saud for its existence co-opted . The ruling family still needs the legitimation conferred by the clergy , but the clergy has become subservient and bureaucratized in the last 25 years . <p> Over time the al-Saud family has sought to add a new dimension to its " right to rule " and its role as provider of the welfare of the nation . The family continually seeks to appeal to these claims through the mechanisms of distribution , coercion , and penetration . Although distributive policies are increasingly challenged by lower oil revenues , they still include health care , education , subsidized food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and widespread investment incentives . Coercion is applied through a massive intelligence apparatus that constrains freedom of expression , assembly , and mobility . The security apparatus is so extensive that the belief in and fear of its retribution historically manifest themselves in pervasive self-censorship . The al-Saud have thoroughly penetrated every aspect of society . They dominate all political positions , are active in every economic sector , strategically marry into other families , and have worked to dominate religious institutions . This is a carrot-and-stick policy of rule , supplemented with a healthy dose of religion . <p> Resistance <p> Resentment of abuse of state authority has long simmered just beneath the surface in Saudi Arabia , but the regime has historically been denounced only in private conversation , with criticism rarely erupting into public confrontation . But two important historic moments of opposition provide striking parallels with todays Islamist opposition movement : the 1929 Ikhwan rebellion and the 1979 seizure of the great mosque in Mecca by Juhaiman al-Utaibi . In both instances , the Islamic legitimacy of the al-Saud family was seriously challenged by movements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Najd . This meant that both movements were composed of muwahidun ( unitarians , commonly called Wahhabis by detractors ) , who follow a particularly austere and puritanical belief system . Both times opposition was justified because the regime deviated from the straight path of the Koran and Sunna . Corruption was a common theme . <p> During the conquests of the peninsula in the early part of the twentieth century , the founder of Saudi Arabia , Abdulaziz , depended on the formidable fighting force of the Ikhwan , tribal muwahidun warriors , to extend the borders of his kingdom . When the strength on which he had depended turned against his leadership , Abdulaziz crushed the Ikhwan as a military force at the Battle of Sabalah in 1930 . Nearly 50 years later , in 1979 , Juhaiman al-Utaibi forcibly took control of the sacred mosque in Mecca in an effort to topple the ruling family . He was the grandson of an Ikhwan warrior ; his charges against King Fahd of corruption , deviation , and dependence on the West echoed his grandfathers charges against Abdulaziz @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chose a holy venue rather than a palace , but the incident exposed the vulnerability of the regime . It took several weeks and the assistance of French special units to root the rebels from the mosque . This uprising led to greater surveillance over the population , more power granted to the mutawwain ( the Saudi " police " of public virtue ) , new constraints on mobility and expression , and simultaneous promises of reform . <p> During the 1980s , an Islamic education system fostered a new generation of sheikhs , professors , and students . The state provided generous funding for the expansion of Islamic universities even during the downturn in oil revenues in the mid-1980s . The regime sought to legitimate itself during hard times by binding religion and state institutionally . Imam Mohamed bin Saud University in Riyadh , the Islamic University in Medina , and Umm al Qura University in Mecca continued to grow even as other programs were cut back . By 1986 , more than 16,000 of the kingdoms 100,000 students were pursuing Islamic studies . By the early 1990s , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This generation of students serves as bureaucrats , police officers , mutawwa , sharia ( Islamic law ) judges , or preachers in some of the 20,000 mosques in the country . <p> An Islamic resurgence swept Saudi Arabia in the 1980s , but it was not directed against the regime . Several nonviolent Islamist groups took root during this time . The resurgence was also propagated by the newly returned Arab Afghan mujahideen ( guerrillas ) . About 12,000 young men from Saudi Arabia had gone to Afghanistan in the 1980s to fight the Soviet occupation ; perhaps 5,000 were properly trained and saw combat . All this cultivated a fertile field for dissent , which culminated in the rise of an Islamist opposition movement during the gulf war in 1990-1991 . Its grievances and justification echo its predecessors . <p> The Gulf War as Catalyst <p> The 1990s were a difficult decade in Saudi Arabia . Festering anger suddenly exploded with the gulf war . The stationing of American troops in the country during the war transformed an inchoate resurgence of Islamic identity into an organized opposition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corruption of the al-Saud . The war also accelerated the debates that were long conducted in private . Although the universities remained closed for much of the war , the mosques became centers of sermons , ideological debate , and political opposition . Secret tapes and underground leaflets were circulated in the streets , schools , and mosques . <p> Although Islam has often been used by the ruling family to bolster the prevailing order , it is also used to oppose that order . During the gulf war , the call to Islam was especially vibrant and empowered sympathizers . Islamists are by far more coherent , powerful , and organized than any other social force in Saudi Arabia , including those based on nationalism , regional identity , or business activity . Islamism provided the vocabulary , symbols , and historic reference points that resonated with the population . Only Islamism was able to give the populace common scripts to confront the overwhelming power of state institutions . Islamism is the only movement that is able to cut across multiple cleavages in Saudi Arabia . It has tapped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ socioeconomic distress . <p> The dissenters have come together on grievances against the regime ; their convergence is indicative of a narrowing base of legitimacy . Despite significant differences in ultimate agenda , many sources of discontent now focus on three central points : calls for redistribution of wealth , procedural social justice , and regime accountability : in essence , the rule of law . Because of this convergence , the state can no longer resort to its time-honored strategy of playing one group against another . This convergence cuts across cleavages of region , gender , class , school of Islam , ethnicity , ideology , and rural-urban settings . Private businesspersons and public bureaucrats , industrialists and small-shop owners , Sunnis and Shias , men and women share core grievances . People are weary of ad hoc and arbitrary personal rule . <p> Islamism also taps into an already-distressed social and economic environment . King Fahd has been incapacitated since his stroke in 1995 , and the family has been wracked by succession struggles . Since the heyday of the oil boom , per capita income has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a very high 3.5 percent . The majority of the population is under 15 . These young adults will register their demands for education , jobs , and housing at the same time . <p> Unemployment in the general male population is about 10 percent , and among recent male college graduates , around 30 percent , likely higher . Yet Saudi Arabia remains utterly dependent on foreign workers , who constitute perhaps 90 percent of the private-sector and 70 percent of the public-sector labor force . Social norms militate against the participation of local women in many economic activities . Moreover , since the gulf war , new social problems , such as guns , drugs , and crime , have been reported . Islamism has tapped into this high level of discomfort in Saudi society . <p> The Islamist Social Movement <p> All strands of the diverse Islamist movement share three key attributes . First , their critique of the regime is both symbolic and material . Second , all are aware of the power of the embedded social structure in which they operate . Third , all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kingdom . <p> Opposition activists charge that the regime , including the official religious authorities , deviated from the straight path . They focus criticism not only on the ruling family but also on the clergy because it is this group that has convinced the people that the al-Saud are Islamic . In interviews this author conducted in London in 1997 and 1999 , one Islamist said , " We must follow true Islam as the prophet and his companions understood it , not as the corrupt scholars say . " Another argued that the " Wahhabi in contemporary Saudi Arabia do not name the exact ancestors to which we should refer because it would undo their own arguments about authority and obedience . If we really read the early stuff , we would see that the ancestors do not advocate blind obedience to unjust rule , but rebellion . Their writing undermines the position of the al-Saud , so they have conveniently been dropped from the discourse . " 1 <p> In material terms , all believe that there has been a fundamental abrogation of the political pact in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Islamists call for a separation of the political and public from the private and commercial . There is shared resentment at corruption and the commissions many princes have received . All call for a halt to the ruling familys intrusion into private life . In a more general sense , all criticize the mismanagement , maldistribution , and waste of national assets . Enormous military expenditures have proved worthless after years of spending . This holistic critique centers on a renegotiation of the political pact ; that is , all want a redefinition of the rules of the game that separates private from public , upholds governance by the rule of law , and abolishes the official state clergy . <p> The second strand that ties the movement together is an awareness of the power of the embedded social structure . The problem of mobilization of an opposition movement is formidable under any authoritarian regime . It is further complicated in Saudi Arabia by oil revenues , which financed both an extensive state intelligence apparatus and a cradle-to-grave welfare state that may placate potential opposition . These constraints are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in ones behavior . The ever-present concern for the privacy of the family unit and discretion in behavior clearly constrains efforts to mount collective public action . <p> Yet family networks have also proved vital to mobilizing support underground . Networks at the village level have been important means by which to disseminate information through sermons . One activist repeatedly emphasized in an interview with this author the importance of the relationship between Saudis and the desert as part of the training and mobilization of opposition . He explained that " people know the desert well . They are able to survive in it because families regularly spend three months in desert camps as a part of holiday . The smallest camps can not have less than 50 people . Americans need mineral water to survive in the desert . A Saudi Arabian can drink mud and survive . " <p> The societal emphasis on the importance of consensus also makes cohesion among dissidents important . Three splits have occurred within the Islamist movement : between the Shia who returned with amnesty and those who stayed in exile to wage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between Khaled al-Fawwaz and Osama bin Laden . These small splits between individuals had painful repercussions in the Islamist movement in Saudi Arabia . <p> The third strand that ties the movement together is criticism of the dominant historical narrative on the founding of the kingdom . All Islamists construct a detailed alternative history of Saudi Arabia from a fabric of cultural symbols and language that resonate among people across divisions of class , region , gender , and status . <p> The dominant narrative is recounted in history textbooks and state-run media . It tells of a glorious history of state formation under the wise leadership of the founder , Abdulaziz , who unified diverse tribes and regions . He married into all defeated tribes to confer membership on them and to instill a sense of nationhood . Islam was embraced by the al-Saud . This history , however , is not congruent with private conversations . Alternative historic narratives are about conquering rather than unification , violence rather than wisdom , and the abuse of Islam rather than its embrace . Marriage into defeated tribes was , according @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> The alternative historic narratives use clear historic reference points . Often recounted are the agreements made between Abdulaziz and representatives of major families , historic meetings between Abdulaziz and the clergy , and the meeting between Abdulaziz and the Hejazi notables , all of which shaped an implicit understanding of the acceptable relationship between state ( under the ruling family ) , religion , and society , including distinctions between public and private . All have been abrogated in recent years . <p> Multiple Clergy <p> In the wake of the gulf war , the state-appointed clergy has been supplemented by a popular-level alternative clergy that is articulate and vocal . The divide between official Islamic authorities and popular Islamic leaders is ggreat . A dissident explained , " The old clergy believe that the ruler is the vice-regent of God on earth . Advice can only be given in private and in confidence . The new clergy reject the idea of vice-regency . Rather , it is the duty of the clergy to criticize the ruler and work for change . " The alternative clergy decries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absence of a capable military despite massive expenditures on weaponry . When the official clergy wrote the fatawa that justified the presence of United States troops on Saudi soil using Islamic vocabulary , other religious leaders offered counter-fatawa that condemned United States troops , also using Islamic justification . The alternative fatawa drew wider public support than did the official fatawa . <p> During this turmoil , Islamists charged King Fahd with deviation from the straight path of Islam . He was criticized for his personal behavior , methods of governance , domestic and foreign policies , and , of course , his decision to allow the stationing of American troops . Influential popular-level sheikhs , such as Salman al-Awdah and Safar al-Hawali , were arrested . Many were forbidden to deliver sermons . <p> During this time of ferment , several petitions were presented to King Fahd that demanded structural reforms in the kingdom . The very dialogue of political intercourse changed . Before the war , criticism could be offered only in private and on a one-to-one verbal basis . Now it was transformed into a public discussion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The most influential petitions were from opposition Sunni clergy . <p> All Islamists concur that the official clergy should be abolished and advocate the existence of contending clerical voices in the country . They argue that debate would be healthy and that each believer could choose to abide by the clergy he or she considers most legitimate . The point is that the ruling family would not control the clergy through the appointment of a single official voice . <p> In spring 1991 , 453 religious scholars , judges , and university professors issued a petition that in strong and direct language called for a restoration of Islamic values . The petition asked for 12 political reforms , including a consultative assembly , fair judiciary , redistribution of wealth , an end to corruption , and the primacy of religious law . The government was shaken because the people thought to be its pillar of support had endorsed such sweeping changes . The ruling family was concerned not only by the petitions content , but also by the very public way in which it was circulated , making the rounds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Because it abrogated the norm for privacy in political discussion , the Supreme Council of Scholars , the elite of the official clergy , condemned the publication and circulation of the petition . <p> In July 1992 , 107 religious scholars signed a " memorandum of advice " ( muzakharat al-nasihi ) to King Fahd . He refused to receive the 46-page document . It was even bolder and more defiant than the petition drafted the previous year . Its tone was straightforward ; its charges , specific . The petitioners deplored the " total chaos in the economy and society . . . widespread bribery , favoritism , and the extreme feebleness of the courts , " criticized virtually every aspect of domestic and foreign policy , and demanded a more rigorous application of Islamic law . <p> Pressures for reform were not limited to Sunni Islamists . Representatives of the Shia Reform Movement ( an umbrella organization of several Shia opposition groups that press for the rights of the minority Shia community in Saudi Arabia ) continued to call for a consultative council that included representatives of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that demanded structural reforms . Forty women kicked their drivers out of their cars and drove through the streets of Riyadh . <p> The al-Saud regime simultaneously denied the existence of an opposition movement , co-opted semiloyalists , and initiated a massive crackdown on dissent . By 1993 , actual organizations were formed to disseminate the opposition message . Demonstrations largely unheard of under this authoritarian regime erupted to demand the release of the imprisoned sheikhs , the most significant occurring in Buraydah in September 1994 , the very heartland of the ruling familys support . Within the Islamist movement , activists disagreed about whether to engage in a public demonstration . Some argued that the timing and the causes were not appropriate , and that the movement was not yet ready . Others fomented the demonstration . The dissension over the Buraydah demonstration highlights the split between the reformists and the radicals in the movement . The radicals became more serious and violent . That split still haunts us today . <p> Islamisms Impact <p> Only three years ago , it was fashionable to dismiss Islamism in Saudi Arabia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hiccup on the domestic front . Observers argued that Islamism had been quashed or co-opted by the al-Saud regime because sheikhs and dissidents were less vocal than before . This was a mistake . Those who made this error were using an inappropriate yardstick , looking only for " regime overthrow " as a measure of success . In fact , Islamist pressures have initiated significant steps toward reform . <p> It is unlikely that Fahd would have created the consultative council in 1992 without the pressure of Islamists ( it had been promised regularly since 1975 ) , or that he would have created provincial councils , or later expanded the membership of the council from 60 to 90 . But the incremental response of King Fahd to popular dissent in the early 1990s has satisfied no one . He appointed a nonlegislative consultative council and gave more power to provincial governments , where other family members ruled . These " reforms " disappointed some and angered others . They consolidated the ruling familys centrality to political life , rather than broadening meaningful participation . <p> Most significantly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ King Fahds illness , would have had a harder time asserting his position in the succession struggles against Prince Sultan ( second in line to the throne ) and his brothers that followed Fahds stroke in 1995 had it not been for the power of the Islamist voice in Saudi Arabia . Abdullah apparently will respond to Islamists in a way that grants concessions to the opposition and protects the ruling family . Specifically , Abdullah has begun to address the grievances , allowing a popular clergy to voice opinions and by reining in the more ostentatious behavior of princes . It is also reported that he has tried to limit the extent to which they participate in oil-related endeavors . In summer 1999 , he released the sheikhs who had been jailed . He has allowed the press a bit more leeway than before . He has publicly criticized United States policy toward Israel and Palestine . Still , on November 14 , 2001 , Abdullah summoned a number of religious authorities to his side . He warned them to be cautious in their rhetoric and to " not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them to avoid inflammatory comments and to " weigh each word before saying it . " <p> Islamists have successfully captured the discourse in Saudi Arabia . The struggles of the Islamist movement have made conversation permissible , an enormous feat in the authoritarian circumstances of Saudi Arabia . Islamists have initiated a renegotiation of the social contract in Saudi Arabia and an alternative telling of history . The al-Saud occupy all positions of authority , but they now must make some compromises in accordance with the historical , material , and ideological critique that the Islamists have eloquently articulated . <p> When the clergy presented King Fahd with the memorandum of advice , the nasihi , they profoundly changed political discourse in Saudi Arabia . It was a collective action conducted in such a way that it had to be taken seriously . The nasihi permitted people to talk about politics and religion in Saudi Arabia , a right that had long been denied . Permission had to come in Islamic vocabulary and with Islamic authority . The nasihi gave ordinary Saudis " cognitive liberation , " that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clergy assumed the risk of political activity for Saudis who were hesitant to speak out . They used their voice to give people a sense of empowerment . The nasihi also gave Saudis " agency by proxy . " Islamists opened the floodgates of criticism in the kingdom by invoking the Islamically grounded right to advise the ruler ( hence , the memorandum of advice ) . <p> If the success of a movement is measured by regime change , then the Islamists have failed in Saudi Arabia . But if success is measured by discourse and meaning , the Islamists clearly have succeeded . The larger debates in Saudi Arabia today are about the construction of meaning as a nation . People are talking about the terms and content of their belonging together , and about the right to talk about such sensitive topics . The contemporary debate is about what it means to be " Saudi " that is , the meaning of citizenship . The Islamists began a national conversation about what it means to belong and about the relationship of state and citizen , and religion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not work in a vacuum , but are intimately tied to the fabric of communal , regional , and economic networks . Islamists , however , have clearly been the most articulate and powerful of the various social forces in Saudi Arabia . They are better organized and more cohesive than other social forces in representing their interests to the state . Even though people disagree on strategy and the ultimate goal of opposition movements , they do concur on grievances and particularly on the call for regularity and predictability . In effect , Islamists express the grievances of many people . <p> Contentious voices also resonate because the exclusionary structure of governance does not reflect the diversity of the population . Contrary to popular images , Saudi Arabia is not a homogeneous country in ethnicity , religion , or ideology . The variety of Muslim practices include Wahhabi orthodoxy , mainstream Sunni calls for reform of the state , minority Shia communities , Sufi practices throughout the Hejaz , and , most important , a Sunni Salafi opposition movement ( the Salafi believers who adhere to the ways of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most powerful voice in Saudi Arabia today ) . In religious , political , social , and economic affairs , inclusion must be practiced . The sprawling religious bureaucracy must be reformed to incorporate the religious diversity of the country , rather than only the muwahidun . Likewise , political positions , from the local to the national level , must allow for the inclusion of diverse ethnic identities , regions , and ideological voices . Reform of the political and religious institutions would promote greater tolerance in Saudi society . <p> In economic matters , the domestic economy must , as the ruling family well knows , be more diverse , private , and local . The overwhelming dependence on foreign labor creates economic and political problems . The private sector must be simultaneously nourished and confronted that is , it must be given protection , particularly in the face of World Trade Organization-mandated direct foreign investment , but it also must hire ( more expensive ) Saudi labor .

The bases are there to protect a stable and cheap supply of oil to the United States and its allies . Yet the presence of the bases fosters opposition to the regime they are there to protect . The bases can not be fully used because of this opposition ( they are not , for example , being used during the current war in Afghanistan ) . It is a vicious circle , but several other basing options ( Oman , Bahrain , Turkey ) are available to the United States . <p> Above all , Saudi Arabians are now looking for more inclusive and representative governance .

Internal contests and choices are more complex than that . <p> The depth of royal coercion has meant that other voices have not been allowed to flourish .

He must preserve a working relationship with the seven brothers who comprise the al-Fahd branch , even though they contest his rule . But Abdullah is 78 years old . He must work quickly and with sensitivity . It is not clear that other high-ranking members of the family carry the same weight in diverse quarters of Saudi society as does Abdullah .

@@2741373 <h> The Immanent Frame <p> For human rights advocates in Turkey , all political alliances are necessarily alliances of convenience . The reasons for this are myriad , ranging from the particular militancy of Turkish nationalism , to the bitterness of Turkeys struggle with Kurdish separatism , to the remarkable trust that Turkish culture continues to bestow on Devlet Baba , the " Father State . " Under the ruling Justice and Development Party ( AKP ) , which is frequently framed as an Islamist Party and just as frequently as a liberal one , supporters of expanded human rights in Turkey have won significant victories and have many , many reasons for concern . <p> From both the perspective of the state and its people Turkeys stance on basic human rights is complex . On the one hand , Turkey is a functioning parliamentary democracy with regular , free , fair elections in a region where this is still a rarity . Despite important limitations , the Turkish press is both broad and diverse . If most of the mainstream Turkish media tends toward populist nationalism , there are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ persistently and successfully critique the great and the powerful . <p> On the other hand , restrictions on freedom of expression and limitations on the press , while enforced only sporadically , are enforced nonetheless , and have a significant cooling effect on public debate . More important is the extent to which the Turkish public accepts these restrictions and other basic limitations on human rights . Among the myriad problems facing Turkey , only one percent of the population cites the justice system as the most important problem facing the country , and only two percent cite democratization . The fiercely nationalist quality of much of Turkish public discourse makes many types of debate suspect , with even the most basic criticisms often seen as treasonous . Similarly , a recent poll suggests that Turks are remarkably accepting of the states use of torture , with a slight majority favoring its limited use in terrorism cases and as much as eighteen percent believing that the state has the right to use it freely . Support for a total ban on torture in Turkey was lower than in any of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At the same time , despite frequent reports of abuse by security services , the military remain far and away the most popular institution in the country , with eighty-one percent of the population expressing confidence in them . <p> The painful reality is that domestic pressure for expanded freedom of expression , minority rights , and protection from abuse by members of the security services is extremely limited . There are important NGOs working to document human rights abuses and defend basic freedoms in Turkey , but they represent an embattled fringe and have a limited role in popular discourse . <p> Given the lack of popular domestic pressure , however , it is the very real improvements in Turkeys human rights record since the AKP first came to power in 2002 that most need to be explained . By understanding the dynamics of the AKPs efforts to improve Turkeys human rights situation , more recent setbacks can best be understood . <p> Although previous governments had made efforts to address Turkeys human rights record , none were willing to engage in the broad , transformative effort envisioned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do so was rooted in both political philosophy and political calculation . Perhaps the largest element of this willingness had to do with their distance from traditional state institutions . Suspect because of their religiosity , members of the AKP maintained the fierce nationalism evident throughout Turkish society but were less inclined to venerate the state and state institutions . As Jenny White has deftly shown , the roots of the AKP came from grassroots mobilization that simultaneously bypassed and fused with state institutions . <p> The AKP also reflected broader changes in Turkish society that had been in motion since the late eighties . One element of this was the indirect role of the West : a large number of the young technocrats who supported the AKP in its rise to power were young men and women who had spent significant portions of their youth in Europe or the United States . In their time abroad they had experienced an environment in which they could express their religiosity more openly than they could in Turkish professional life . These individuals , comfortable with pluralism but personally devout , formed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ AKP . The diversification of Turkish media allowed for the development of a sophisticated Islamist press , while the opening of the economy and expansion of education created a large and devout middle class . Finally , a number of NGOs developed that were simultaneously distinctly religious in character and dedicated to the issue of human rights in Turkey . Of these the most prominent is Mazlum-Der , founded in 1991 , which is now an important element of Turkish human rights activism . While these groups were not necessarily large , they played an important role in merging the language of human rights with the specific concerns of Turkeys devout and in building bridges with secular human rights groups both in Turkey and overseas . <p> The AKP developed as a party willing to overturn long held certainties of the Kemalist state . In foreign policy , Turkey simultaneously improved relations with its Arab and Iranian neighbors and made important steps toward resolving the continued division of Cyprus . The AKPs most important efforts , however , were in the attempt to move forward with Turkeys long held aspirations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ AKPs foreign and domestic policy are most clearly merged . <p> The process of European accession provided the AKP with a number of important benefits . First , by being more " pro-European " than any of the secular opposition parties the AKP was able to support its claim that it was not an Islamist party , but rather a forward-looking party of the center-right . Second , the policy was electorally savvy because the proposition of European accession was extremely popular at the beginning of the AKPs term in office and , despite considerable setbacks , maintains considerable popularity to this day . Third , progress in European accession helped lure in considerable foreign investment , which in turn served as the engine for rapid economic growth through the first years of AKP rule . Fourth and finally , the process of liberalization that the European Union demanded would also serve the AKPs domestic interests by undermining the power of Kemalist strongholds in the bureaucracy and military and by opening greater opportunities for religious expression that were expected by the AKPs base . <p> Whether one believes the AKP @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early program of liberalization was impressive . As Sultan Tepe shows , bans on publishing and broadcasting in Kurdish were lifted , citizen access to government documents was broadened , and the penal code was reformed . Quietly , Kurdish villagers who had been forcibly relocated in the previous decade were allowed to return to their homes . Torture and harassment became less frequent . As one Kurdish activist told me , " When we have a gathering , we are still arrested . But there is n't torture like there used to be . " The AKP was initially optimistic that the broadened freedom to use the headscarf in public institutions would also be addressed under a " European umbrella " ; however , in 2004 the European Court of Human Rights ruled that banning students from wearing the headscarf in the university did not constitute a limit on religious freedom . Thus , while the general human rights record of Turkey was in many ways improving , the AKP was failing in addressing the one issue that most concerned its base . <p> Whether it was because they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because they saw these reforms as a cover for an Islamist agenda ( or both ) , both the parliamentary opposition and Kemalist elements in the military and courts worked to undermine the AKP reform agenda . Military and security services were involved in the 2005 bombing of a Kurdish bookstore in the town of +Pemdinli , which killed one and injured others , and they seem to have been at least indirectly involved in the assassination of Armenian journalist Hrant Dink in 2007 . These attacks , as well as a far broader pattern of harassment and threat , served three purposes simultaneously : they demonstrated the limits of AKP power , they undermined the AKPs international support , and they served as a fundamental damper on those who wished to take advantage of the AKPs liberalization program . Prosecutors as well as private lawyers used the loosely framed Article 301 , which makes " denigrating Turkishness " a crime punishable by imprisonment for up to three years , as well as similar statues in the same way . These cases carried a message for the Turkish public , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the AKP , with the support of Western powers , was intent on undermining Turkey through criticism of its greatest heroes and most venerated institutions . <p> As European accession faltered , the AKP became more defensive in the face of these attacks and less ambitious in its reform efforts . It allowed the case against the soldiers implicated in the +Pemdinli attack to be tried in a military rather than a civilian court , thus limiting the possibility that high level officers would be implicated . At the same time , the AKP rank and file seemed to be as leery of ridding themselves of 301 as the opposition . The government suggested various changes in nuance to Article 301 rather than doing away with it altogether . <p> It was not to be . Increased separatist violence effectively forced the AKP to give in to the militarys demand for a more aggressive policy with regard to the Kurds , including incursions into Iraqi Kurdistan . More tellingly , as Jenny White described in her February article for The Immanent Frame , the AKP made an alliance with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lend its parliamentary support to a broadening of freedoms for the headscarf , in return for which the AKP would drop its plans for a far wider program of liberalization . The decision suggests both the centrality of the headscarf issue for a significant section of Turkish society and the limitations of the AKPs own commitment to a broad human rights agenda for Turkey . <p> Ironically , the alliance bore little fruit . The constitutional amendment lifting the ban on headscarves in the universities , which the AKP and MHP had passed , was struck down by the Constitutional Court in June , 2007 , while a case which threatened to ban the AKP itself continued to wind its way through the legal process . In the end the AKP avoided , by the narrowest of margins , an outright ban . It emerged , nonetheless , significantly chastened by the experience . <p> In the intervening months , AKP reform efforts have been markedly muted . Rather than move forward on human rights or constitutional reform , it has turned its attention instead to foreign policy initiatives , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quietly supporting the on-going court case against the ultranationalist Ergenekon network , which , not incidentally , seems to have included many of the AKPs most militant critics . The unraveling of the Ergenekon conspiracy is , without question , a remarkably important component of Turkeys democratization . <p> The recent past has taken much of the luster off of the AKPs record for human rights reform . Many human rights advocates still see the AKP as the best hope for broad reform in Turkey . Nonetheless , the AKPs record shows that its commitment to human rights , while real , is limited and contingent . They are not , to be sure , the secret Islamic revolutionaries envisioned by the Turkish military and some of conservative commentators in the United States . But neither are they the shining model for Muslim liberalism that some have imagined them to be . <p> This entry was posted on Thursday , October 23rd , 2008 at 11:11 am and is allowed . <h> Leave a Reply <p> Please note : All comments will be approved by an administrator before they appear on this page . 
@@2741376 <h> Contemporary Conflicts <p> Who are the Darfurians ? Arab and African Identities , Violence and External Engagement <p> By Alex de Waal <p> Published on : Dec 10 , 2004 <p> Alex de Waal is a fellow of the Global Equity Initiative at Harvard University , and programme director at the Social Science Research Council in New York . He is the author of Famine that Kills : Darfur , Sudan ( revised edition , Oxford University Press 2005 ) and , jointly with Julie Flint , of Darfur : A Short History of a Long War ( forthcoming , Zed Press , September 2005 ) . <p> This paper is an attempt to explain the processes of identity formation that have taken place in Darfur over the last four centuries . The basic story is of four overlapping processes of identity formation , each of them primarily associated with a different period in the region 's history . The four are the ' Sudanic identities ' associated with the Dar Fur sultanate , Islamic identities , the administrative tribalism associated with the 20th century Sudanese state , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' identities , associated with new forms of external intrusion and internal violence . It is a story that emphasizes the much-neglected east-west axis of Sudanese identity , arguably as important as the north-south axis , and redeems the neglect of Darfur as a separate and important locus for state formation in Sudan , paralleling and competing with the Nile Valley . It focuses on the incapacity of both the modern Sudanese state and international actors to comprehend the singularities of Darfur , accusing much Sudanese historiography of ' Nilocentrism ' , namely the use of analytical terms derived from the experience of the Nile Valley to apply to Darfur . <p> The term ' Darfurian ' is awkward . Darfur refers , strictly speaking , to ' domain of the Fur ' . As I shall argue , ' Fur ' was historically an ethno-political term , but nonetheless , at any historical point has referred only to a minority of the region 's population , which includes many ethnicities and tribes.1 However , from the middle ages to the early 20th century , there was a continuous history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remarks that there is a striking acceptance of Darfur as a single entity over this period.2 Certainly , living in Darfur in the 1980s , and traveling to most parts of the region , the sense of regional identity was palpable . This does not mean there is agreement over the identity or destiny of Darfur . There are , as I shall argue , different and conflicting ' moral geographies ' . But what binds Darfurians together is as great as what divides them . <p> Identity formation in Darfur has often been associated with violence and external engagement . One of the themes of this paper is that today 's events have many historic precursors . However , they are also unique in the ideologically-polarized nature of the identities currently in formation , and the nature of external intrusion into Darfur . The paper concludes with a brief discussion of the implications of the U.S. determination that genocide is occurring in Darfur . There is a danger that the language of genocide and ideologically polarized identities will contribute to making the conflict more intractable . <p> While primarily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a political purpose also . It is my contention that , for almost a century , Darfurians have been unable to make their history on their own terms , and one reason for that , is the absence of a coherent debate on the question , ' Who are the Darfurians ? ' By helping to generate such a debate , I hope it will be possible for the many peoples for whom Darfur is a common home to discover their collective identity . <h> Sudanic Identities <p> The first of the processes of identity formation is , the ' Sudanic model ' associated with indigenous state formation . In this respect , it is crucial to note that Dar Fur ( the term I will use for the independent sultanate , from c. 1600 to 1916 , with a break 1874-98 ) was a separate centre of state formation from the Nile Valley , which was at times more powerful than its riverain competitors . Indeed , Dar Fur ruled Kordofan from about 1791 to 1821 and at times had dominion over parts of the Nile Valley , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Darfurians . Before the 20th century , only once in recorded history did a state based on the Nile rule Darfur , and then only briefly and incompletely ( 1874-82 ) . This has been grossly neglected in the ' Nilocentric ' historiography of Sudan . Rather than the ' two Sudans ' familiar to scholars and politicians , representing North and South , we should consider ' three Sudans ' and include Dar Fur as well . <p> The Keira Sultanate followed on from a Tunjur kingdom , with a very similarly-placed core in northern Jebel Marra ( and there are many continuities between the two states , notably in the governance of the northern province ) and a Daju state , based in the south of the mountain . Under the sultanate , we have an overall model of identity formation with a core Fur-Keira identity , surrounded by an ' absorbed ' set of identities which can be glossed as Fur-Kunjara ( with the Tunjur ethnicity , the historic state-forming predecessor of the Fur-Keira ) enjoying similarly privileged status immediately to the north ) . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ states including imperial Ethiopia , the Funj , Kanem-Borno and other Sudanic entities . Analysing this allows us to begin to address some of the enduring puzzles of Fur ethnography and linguistics , namely the different political structures of the different Fur clans and the failure to classify the Fur language , which appears to have been creolized as it spread from its core communities . However , the ethnography and history of the Fur remain desperately under-studied and under-documented . <p> Surrounding this are subjugated groups . In the north are both nomadic Bedouins ( important because camel ownership and long-distance trade were crucial to the wealth of the Sultan ) and settled groups . Of the latter , the Zaghawa are the most important . In the 18th century , the Zaghawa were closely associated with the state . Zaghawa clans married into the ruling Keira family , and they provided administrators and soldiers to the court . To the south are more independent groups , some of which ' became Fur ' by becoming absorbed into the Fur polity , and others of which retain a strong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As in all such states , the king used violence unsparingly to subordinate these peripheral peoples . <p> To the far south is Dar Fertit , the term ' Fertit ' signifying the enslaveable peoples of the forest zone . This is where the intrinsically violent nature of the Fur state is apparent . The state reproduced itself through dispatching its armies to the south , obtaining slaves and other plunder , and exporting them northwards to Egypt and the Mediterranean . This nexus of soldiers , slaves and traders is familiar from the historiography of Sudanic states , where ' wars without end ' were essential to ensure the wealth and power of the rulers.3 O'Fahey describes the slaving party as the state in miniature.4 This in turn arose because of the geo-political position of the Sultanate on the periphery of the Mediterranean world , consumer of slaves , ivory and other plunder-related commodities.5 During the 18th and 19th century , the Forty Days Road to Asyut was Egypt 's main source of slaves and other sub-Saharan commodities . When Napoleon Bonaparte occupied Egypt , he exchanged letters and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the major groups in Darfur are patrilineal , with identity inherited through the male line . One implication of this is that identity change can occur through the immigration of powerful males , who were in a position to marry into leading families or displace the indigenous men . Historically , the exception may have been some groups classed as Fertit , which were matrilineal . A combination of defensive identity formation under external onslaught and Islamization appears to have made matrilineality no more than a historical fragment . This , however , only reinforces the point that identity change is a struggle to control women 's bodies . With the exception of privileged women at court , women are almost wholly absent from the historical record . But , knowing the sexual violence that has accompanied recent conflicts , we can surmise that rape and abduction were likely to have been mechanisms for identity change on the southern frontier . <p> Identity formation in the Sultanate changed over the centuries , from a process tightly focused on the Fur identity ( from about 1600 to the later 1700s ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lost its ideologically ethnic character and ruled through an administrative hierarchy ( up to 1916 ) . It is also important to note the role of claims to Arab genealogy in the legitimation and the institutions of the state . The founding myth of the Sultanate includes Arab descent , traceable to the Prophet Mohammed . This is again familiar from all Sudanic states ( Ethiopia having the variant of the Solomonic myth ) . Arabic was important because it brought a literate tradition , the possibility of co-opting traders and teachers from the Arab world , and above all because of the role of Islam as the state religion . <p> The state 's indigenous Arab population was meanwhile ' Arab ' chiefly in the archaic sense , used by Ibn Khaldun and others , of ' Bedouin ' . This is a sense still used widely , and it is interesting that the Libyan government ( one of three Bedouin states , the others being Saudi Arabia and Mauritania ) , has regarded Tuaregs and other Saharan peoples as ' Arab ' . <p> This model of identity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of figure 1 . <p> Figure 1 <p> Moral geography of the Dar Fur sultanate as seen from the centre . <p> One significance of this becomes apparent when we map the categories onto the Turko-Egyptian state in the middle Nile Valley , 1821-74 . For this state " which is essentially the direct predecessor of what we have today " the core identity is ' Arab ' , focused on the three tribes Shaigiya , Jaaliyiin and Danagla . ( The first and second are particularly dominant in the current regime . The last is ' Nubian ' , illustrating just how conditional the term ' Arab ' can be . ) The other identity pole was originally ' Sudanese ' , the term used for enslaveable black populations from the South in the 19th and early 20th centuries , but which by a curious process of label migration , came by the 1980s to refer to the ruling elite , the three tribes themselves . Meanwhile , the Southerners had adopted the term ' African ' to assert their identity , contributing to a vibrant debate among Sudanese @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and African worlds.6 From the viewpoint of Southern Sudan ( and indeed east Africa ) , ' African ' and ' Arab ' are polar opposites . From the viewpoint of Darfur and its ' Sudanic ' orientation , ' Arab ' is merely one subset of ' African ' . Darfurians had no difficulty with multiple identities , and indeed would have defined their African kingdom as encompassing indigenous Arabs , both Bedouins and culturally literate Arabs . <p> The transfer of the term ' African ' from Southern Sudan to Darfur , and its use , not to encompass the Fertit groups but to embrace the state-forming Fur and Tunjur , and the similarly historically privileged Zaghawa , Masalit , Daju and Borgu , is therefore an interesting and anthropologically na+ve category transfer . ' African ' should have rather different meanings in Darfur . <p> Dar Fur 's downfall came in the 1870s because it lost out to its competitor , the Turko-Egyptian regime and its client Khartoum traders , over the struggle for the slaving/raiding monopoly in the southern hinterland . The current boundaries of Sudan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's agents had reached at the time when their predatory expansion was halted by the Mahdist revolution . Their commerce and raiding inflicted immense violence on the peoples it conquered , subjecting them to famine and in some cases , complete dissolution and genocide . Historians have managed to reconstruct some of the societies that existed before this onslaught , but others live on in memory only , and others have disappeared without trace.7 <h> Islamic Identities <p> The second model is the ' Islamic model ' . This substantially overlaps with the ' Sudanic model ' and complements it , but also has distinctive differences , which came to a head with the Sudanese Mahdiya ( 1883-98 ) . Let us begin with the overlaps . <p> Islam was a state cult in Dar Fur from the 17th century . Most likely , Islam came to Dar Fur from the west , because the region was part of the medieval Kanem-Bornu empire , which was formally Islamic from the 11th century if not earlier . Nilocentric historians have tended to assume that Islam reached Dar Fur from the Nile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is not the case . For example , the dominant Sufi orders in Darfur are west African in origin ( notably the Tijaniya ) , and the script used was the Andalusian-Saharan script , not the classic Arab handwriting of the Nile Valley . <p> The majority of Darfur 's Arab tribes migrated into the sultanate in the middle of the 18th century , from the west.8 They trace their genealogy to the Juheiyna group , and ultimately to the Prophet ( in common with all ruling lineages , Arab or non-Arab ) . During the 18th century , they exhibited a general south and eastward drift . At all times they were cultivators and herders of both camels and cattle , but as they moved east and south , cattle herding came to predominate and they became known collectively as the Baggara . Most of the tribal names they now possess emerged in the 18th , 19th or 20th centuries , in some cases as they merged into new political units . An interesting and important example is the Rizeigat , a vast confederation of clans and sections @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sections ( Nawaiba , Mahamid and Mahriya ) converging to create the Rizeigat of ed Daien in south-eastern Darfur . But they also left substantial sections to the north and west , historic remnants of this migration . These sections have a troubled and uncertain relationship with their larger southern cousins , alternately claiming kinship and independence . Whereas the southern , Baggara , Rizeigat were awarded a territory by the Fur Sultan ( who had not subjugated the area where they chose to live ) , the northern clans continued a primarily nomadic existence on the desert edge , without a specific place they could call home . When sections did settle ( and many did ) , they were subject to the administrative authority of the Sultan 's provincial governor of the northern region , Dar Takanawi or Dar el Rih . For historic reasons , this was an area in which administration was relatively de-tribalised , so the northern Bedouins were integrated into the Sultanate more as subjects than as quasi-autonomous tribal units . <p> The same process explains why we have a large Beni Halba Baggara @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a small Abbala group further to the north , and also similarly for the Misiriya whose main territories lie in south Kordofan , but who have remnant sections in northwest Darfur and Chad . Meanwhile the Zayadiya and Ma'aliya are not Juheiyna at all , and did not migrate in the same manner , and had different ( though not necessarily easier ) historic relations with the Sultanate . <p> The Hausa and Fulani migrations that occurred in the 19th and 20th centuries also have important parallels . They too populated substantial territories in Darfur ( and also further east ) , and included remnant and more purely pastoral sections ( such as the Um Bororo ) that continued the eastward migration well into the late 20th century . An important component of the eastward drift is the influence of the Haj ( many see themselves as ' permanent pilgrims ' , seeking to move towards Mekka ) , and Mahdist tradition that emphasizes eastward migration.9 As we shall see , militant Mahdism is itself an import into Sudan from west Africa , brought with these migrants . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as the Borgu and Birgid , both of them sedentary Sudanic peoples . We should not see eastward migration as exclusively a phenomenon of politically-Islamized groups , pastoralists or Arabs . <p> The Juheiyna groups brought with them their own , distinctive ' moral geography ' , one familiar to pastoral nomadic groups across the central Sudan and Sahelian regions . This sees all land as belonging to Allah , with right of use and settlement belonging to those who happen upon it . It sees Darfur as a chequerboard of different localities , some belonging to farmers and others to herders , with the two groups in a mutually-advantageous exchange relationship . It is also open-ended , especially towards the east . ( The extent to which this is co-terminous with the moral geography of a Muslim pilgrim , exemplified by the west African migrants in Sudan , is an interesting question . ) <p> This is represented in figure 2 , which was drawn for me in outline by one of the most eminent Abbala Sheikhs , Hilal Musa of the Um Jalul Rizeigat , in 1985 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Darfur , from a camel pastoralist viewpoint . <p> Several legacies of this are evident today . Most of the ' Arab ' groups involved in militia activities including land grabbing are what we might call the Abbala remnants , with weak historic claims to tribally-defined territories , and traditions of migration and settlement to the east and south . Meanwhile , the majority of the Baggara Arabs of south Darfur are uninvolved in the current conflict . <p> Three other elements in the Islamic identity formation process warrant comment . One is Mahdism , which arrived in Darfur from the west , and has clear intellectual and social origins in the Mahdist state founded by Osman Dan Fodio in what is now northern Nigeria . Unlike the Nile Valley , where the Mahdist tradition was weak , in the west African savannas it was strong and well-articulated . Dan Fodio wrote ten treatises on Mahdism plus more than 480 vernacular poems , and insisted that the Mahdi had to bear the name Mohamed Ahmed ( which ruled him out ) .10 The first Mahdist in 19th century Sudan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sufi scholar from somewhere in west Africa , who met the Dongolawi holy militant Mohamed Ahmed in 1881 and proclaimed him the Mahdi , in turn becoming his Khalifa . The majority of the Mahdist armies derived from the Baggara of Darfur and Kordofan , and for most of its existence the Mahdist state in Omdurman was ruled by the Khalifa and his Ta'aisha kinsmen . In fulfillment of Mahdist prophecy and to support his power base , the Khalifa ordered the mass and forced migration of western peoples to Omdurman . The Mahdiya was , to a significant extent , a Darfurian enterprise . And it involved extreme violence , though of a radically different kind from that on which the Dar Fur sultanate was founded . This was religious , messianic Jihad , including population transfers on a scale not seen before or since . <p> Such is the stubborn Nilocentrism of Sudanese historiography that the influence of west African and Darfurian forms of Islam on this pivotal episode in Sudanese history are consistently under-estimated . It was the collision between the heterodox Mahdist Jihadism of the west @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the more orthodox and hierarchical ( though also Sufist ) Islam of the Nile Valley that created the Mahdiya . <p> The Mahdist period is remembered even today in the cultural archive of a time of extraordinary turmoil and upheaval . It was a time of war , pillage and mass displacement . In 1984/5 , people looked back to the drought of 1913/14 as their historical point of reference . One wonders if the current historic reference point is the famine of 1888/9 , known as ' Sanat Sita ' because it occurred in the year six ( 1306 Islamic calendar ) , and which seems to have surpassed the Darfurians ' otherwise inventive capacity for naming tragedy . <p> Beyond that historic precedent , I do not want to suggest that there are parallels between the Mahdiya and contemporary or recent political Islam in Sudan , which has had its own manifestations of extreme violence and jihadism . On the contrary , I would argue that it is the failure of Sudan 's recent Islamist project that has contributed to the war in Darfur . This arises from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ al Turabi 's alliance-building across the east-west axis of Sudanese identities . <p> Among the many intellectual and practical innovations in Turabi 's Islamism was an opening to African Muslims as individuals and African Islam as a tradition . The National Islamic Front recognized that Darfur represented a major constituency of devout Muslims that could be mobilized . It made significant openings to Darfur and to the substantial Fellata communities across Sudan.11 It promised that Islam could be a route to enfranchisement as citizens of an Islamic state . In doing so , Turabi and his followers moved away from the traditional focus of the political Islamists on the more orthodox Islam of the Nile Valley , and its close association with the Arab world . It was , unfortunately , a false promise : the Sudanese state is the inheritor of the exclusivist project of the 19th century Khartoum traders , and sought only to enlist the Darfurians and Fellata as foot soldiers in this enterprise . For the Fellata it had a quick win : it could grant them citizenship , correcting a longstanding anomaly of nationality policy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaders as a result . But for Darfurians , the best it offered was relative neutrality in the emergent conflicts between Darfur 's Arabs and non-Arabs , and increasingly , not even that . Darfur was marginal even to the Islamists ' philanthropic projects in the 1990s , which at least provided basic services and food relief to many remote rural communities . Perhaps because the Islamists took the region for granted , and certainly because the ruling groups were focused on the threats from the South , Nuba and Blue Nile , Darfur was neglected in the series of Islamist projects aimed at social transformation . <p> When the Islamist movement split in 1999 , most Darfurian Islamists went into opposition . By an accident of fate , the most powerful Darfurian in the security apparatus was an airforce general from the Abbala Rizeigat , and members of those sections were rapidly put in place as leaders of the Popular Defence Force in critical locations , removing men whom the government suspected of having sympathies with the Turabi faction . Thus was created a set of militias popularly known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to refer to Chadian Abbala militias that used western Darfur as a rear base in the mid-1980s , and who armed some of their Abbala brethren and helped instigate major clashes in 1987-90 . The Darfur war is , in a significant way , a fight over the ruins of the Sudanese Islamist movement , by two groups , both of which seem to have abandoned any faith that the Islamist project will deliver anything other than power . <p> The third note of significance concerns the position of women . In the Tijaniyya sect , with its far more egalitarian tradition than the Sufis of the Nile , women can achieve the status of sheikh or teacher . This reflects both the religious traditions of the Sudanic region , and also the relatively higher socio-economic status of women in savanna societies , where they could own their own fields and engage in trade in their own right . Darfurian ethnographies repeatedly note the economic independence enjoyed by women , among non-Arab and Arab groups alike . The subsequent spread of Islamic orthodoxy , described more below , contributed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ' Becoming Sudanese ' <p> The British conquest of Dar Fur in 1916 , and the incorporation of the then-independent sultanate of Dar Masalit in 1922-3 , represented a clear break with the past . Darfur was ruled by an external Leviathan which had no economic interest in the region and no ideological ambition other than staving off trouble . Darfur was annexed when the basic determinants of British policies in Sudan had already been established , and the main decisions ( e.g. , the adoption of Native Administration after 1920 , the expulsion of Egyptian civil servants after 1924 , the embrace of neo-Mahdism and the Khatmiya , the adoption of the Famine Regulations in the 1930s , the Sudanisation of the civil service , and the moves towards independence ) were all taken with scant reference to Darfur . <p> The key concern in Darfur in the decade after the conquest was security , and specifically the prevention of Mahdist uprisings . An attack on Nyala in 1921 was among the most serious threats the new rulers faced , and the last significant uprising was in 1927 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immediate danger , in the form of revolutionary nationalism on the slogan of unity of the Nile Valley , among the educated elite and detribalized elements , especially Sudanese soldiers . To suppress both , and to ensure the utmost economy in rural administration , the British chose a policy of ' Native Administration ' . This was not ' Indirect Rule ' as practiced in the Nigerian Emirates or Buganda ( except in the case of the Sultanate of Dar Masalit , where the British officer was a Resident ) . Rather , it was the creation of a new hierarchy of tribal administrators , with the significant innovation of the ' omda , the administrative chief intermediate between the paramount chief ( ' nazir ' for Arab tribes ) and the village sheikh . ' Omda was an Egyptian office specially imported for the purpose.12 <p> In a series of ordinances , the British regularized the status of tribal authorities . A particularly important act was to grant judicial powers to chiefs , in addition to their executive powers . This was a means of setting the tribal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on both millenarian preachers and discontented graduates . ( It is interesting that the leader of the 1924 nationalist revolt , Ali Al Latif , as a detribalized Southerner or ' Sudanese ' in the parlance of the day , having no tribal leader to whom he could become subject , was kept in jail in Sudan long beyond his prison term , and then exiled to Egypt . ) Along with this came the ' Closed Districts Ordinance ' , much criticized for shutting off the South and Nuba Mountains from external influences , but used in Darfur to keep an eye on wandering preachers and west African immigrants . <p> But the most significant corollary of Native Administration was tidying up the confusion of ethnic identities and tribal allegiances that existed across Sudan . This was an administrative necessity more than an ideological cleaning-up . <p> The colonial archives from the 1920s and ' 30s are filled with exchanges of letters on how to organize the ethnic chaos encountered in rural Sudan.13 In Darfur , the most significant question was the administration of the Rizeigat , which included @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , regulating the shared pastures on the Bahr el Arab river , also grazed by the Dinka , and deciding the status of the Abbala Rizeigat ( initially subject to Nazir Ibrahim Madibbu , then with their own deputy Nazir , finally with their own full Nazir ) . Other activities included grouping the two sections of the Beni Hussein together , and providing them with land in north-western Darfur ( a very rare instance of a wholesale tribal relocation , albeit one done with the consent of the section that needed to be relocated ) , administratively uniting the two parts of the Beni Halba , finding means of appointing a chief for the Birgid , grouping the miscellaneous sections living in an area called ' Dar Erenga ' together to form one tribe , etc . A lot of attention was paid to the Fertit groups living on Darfur 's southern frontier , including a brave but futile attempt to move them into Southern Sudan and create a ' cordon sanitaire ' between Muslims and non-Muslims . But this was an anomaly : the basic approach was ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reformed in the 1940s and 1960s ( when chiefs were stripped of most of their judicial powers ) and formally abolished in 1971 , although many people elected to Rural People 's Councils were former native administrators . <p> Along with the regularizing of tribal administration came the formalizing of boundaries . The British stuck with the four-fold division of the Dar Fur sultanate into provinces , and demarcated tribal territories for the Baggara in south Darfur ( following the Sultan 's practice ) . Elsewhere , the allocation of tribal dars was somewhat haphazard . The creation of Dar Beni Hussein in the western part of north Darfur was anomalous : when a group did not present a problem , it was left to be . However , the de facto recognition of the legality of a tribal dar in south Darfur began to build a legacy.14 Beforehand , the term ' dar ' had been used in many different senses , ranging from a specific location or administrative unit , to the specific territory of an ethnic group , to the whole Sultanate , to an abstract region @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , twinned with a tribally-based administrative system with judicial powers , the term ' dar ' came primarily to refer to an ethnic territory in which the dominant group had legal jurisdiction . By the 1970s , Sudan 's leading land law scholar could conclude that tribes have become ' almost the owners of their homelands . ' 15 During most of the 20th century , this had no significant political repercussions , as it coincided nicely with the customary practice of a settler adopting the legal code of one 's hosts . There was sufficient free land , and a strong enough tradition of hospitality to settlers , that by the 1970s all ' dars ' in south Darfur were ethnically mixed , some of them with very substantial settler populations from the drought-stricken north . <p> Let us not over-emphasize the implications of tribal administration for identity formation . It undoubtedly slowed and even froze processes of identity formation . But it was lightly implemented . Many district officers in Darfur reveled in the myriad forms of ethnic identity and chieftanship they found , documenting the intermediate identities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Jebel Si Arabs , the Dar Fongoro Fur , and numerous others ; also allowing Darfurian administrators to keep their wonderful array of traditional titles including Sultan , Mek , Dimangawi , Shartay , Amir , and Nazir . Given that there were no significant economic interests in Darfur , no project for social change or modernization , and no land alienation , we must recognize the limits of imperial social engineering . It had a very light hand , both for good and i 'll . <p> Indeed , in the 1960s and ' 70s , Darfur became something of a textbook case for identity change . During the preparatory studies for establishing the Jebel Marra Rural Development Project , a number of eminent social anthropologists were employed to study social change in Darfur.16 Among their writings are a number of studies on how sedentary Fur farmers , on acquiring sufficient cattle , would ' become Baggara ' in stages , to the extent of teaching their children the Arabic language and adopting many socio-cultural traits of the pastoralists they moved with . This was a remarkable reversal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for political reasons ; now individuals might ' become Baggara ' for economic ones . There were also studies of the sedenterization of nomads , underlining how the nomad/farmer distinction is an extremely blurred one . Sadly , there were no comparable studies in northern Darfur . <p> Most proposals for a settlement of Darfur 's conflict include the revival of Native Administration in some form , both for the resolution of inter-communal conflicts ( including settling land disputes ) and for local administration.17 Whether or not the important role of chiefs ' courts will be re-established is far less clear . However , the context of the early 21st century is very different from the 1920s . This is clear from a brief examination of the role played by the tribal leaders in the resolution of the 1987-9 conflict and the revived Native Administration Council after 1994 . <p> The first major conflict in Darfur of recent times occurred in 1987-9 , and had many elements that prefigure today 's war , not least the fact that the major protagonists were Fur militia and Abbala Arab fighters known as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called including tribal leaders on both sides , some of whom sought to reestablish their authority over younger militant leaders , and some who sought for advancement of their own positions . Assisted by the fact that the NIF coup occurred while the conference was in session " allowing both sides to make compromises without losing face " an agreement was reached . But it was not implemented ; fighting broke out again , and another conference was held in early 1990 , which came with similar recommendations , which again were not properly implemented . The key lesson from this is that Native Administration is not a solution in itself , but rather a component of finding and implementing a solution . Control of armed groups , payment of compensation , and measures to deal with the causes of dispute are all necessary . <p> A form of Native Administration Council was established in 1994 , a measure that coincided with the division of Darfur into three states and renewed conflict in western Darfur . There are two ways in which the NAC is implicated in the conflict . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usually called Emirates ) as a means of rewarding its followers and undermining the power of the Umma Party , which retained the allegiance of many of the older generation of sheikhs . Second , the positions were awarded with a new , simplified and more administratively powerful view of ethnicity . The very rationale for creating the new entities was to reinforce the power of a central authority ( a party as much as , or more than , a state ) . In a militarized environment , with no services delivered by party or state , the reward for the new chiefs was the power to allocate land and guns within their jurisdiction . It was a recipe for local level ethnic cleansing , which duly occurred in several places . <p> During the colonial period " less than four decades for Darfur , scarcely three for Dar Masalit " and the first decades of independence , Darfur was subject to a state in Khartoum which knew little , and cared less , about this faraway region . Little changed with independence . The entire debate over Sudanese @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were whether Sudan should be united with Egypt , and what should be the status of the South.18 The position of Darfur was almost wholly absent from this discourse , and remained a footnote in ongoing debates on Sudanese national identity . For example , perhaps the most eloquent analyst of the dilemmas of Sudanese identity , writing in the format of fiction that allows him to explore more explicitly the unstated realities of Sudanese racism , treats Darfurian identity wholly within the North-South framework.19 <p> The state that ensued was a clear successor to the Turko-Egyptian colonial state . It was , and remains , a merchant-soldier state , espousing Arabism , using Arabic as a language of instruction in schools and in the media , and promoting Islam as a state ideology . Its political discourse is almost wholly Nilo-centric : the key debates leading up to independence concerned whether Sudan would opt for unity with Egypt under the slogan of ' unity of the Nile Valley ' , and subsequent debates on national identity have been framed along the North-South axis of whether Sudan is part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by scholars and activists to assert that Sudan is at once Arab and African , and that the two are fully compatible . These efforts came from all parts of the political spectrum : it is particularly interesting to see the Islamists ' arguments on this score.20 Some of the academic historians who engaged in this debate worked on Sudan 's westward links . They , however , were both academically a minority and found no political reverberations for their writings . Whether polarizing or attempting bridging , the discourse was overwhelmingly North-South . And , within Northern Sudan especially , we see the relentless progress of absorption into the culture of the administrative and merchant elite . <p> What we see is a process that has been called many names , of which I prefer ' Sudanization , ' following Paul Doornbos , who produced a series of superb if under-referenced studies of this phenomenon in Dar Masalit in the early 1980s.21 ' Arabization ' is not adequate , because Darfur 's indigenous Bedouin Arabs were also subject to the same process , and because it did not result @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , individuals came to belong to a category of Sudanese who spoke Arabic , wore the jellabiya or thoub , prayed publicly , used paper money , and abandoned tribal dancing and drinking millet beer . Doubtless , the newly-Sudanised were at social and financial disadvantage when dealing with the established elites . But they were not expropriated of land or identity , and most of them straddled both the ' Sudanised ' and local identities , and gained from it . <p> One of the most marked aspects of Sudanisation is a change in the status of women . The Darfurian Sudanised women is ( ideally ) circumcised , secluded at home , economically dependent on her husband , meek in her behaviour , and dressed in the thoub . The spread of female circumcision in Darfur in the 1970s and ' 80s , at a time when the Sudanese metropolitan elite was moving to abandon the practice , is perhaps the most striking physical manifestation of this process , and yet another illustration of how identity change is marked on women 's bodies . It is also an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> What is remarkable about these processes of identity change is not that they occurred , or that they were subject to the arbitrary impositions of a state , but that they were almost entirely non-violent ( with the significant caveat of genital mutilation ) . This is an important contrast with the South and the Nuba Mountains . <p> Incorporation into a Sudanese polity did bring with it a clear element of racism , based on colour of skin , and facial characteristics . Although both the Sudanic and Islamic processes of identity formation could not avoid a racial tinge , it was with Egyptian dominance and the successor Sudanese state that this became dominant . The Egyptian or Mediterranean littoral ' moral geography ' of Dar Fur can be charted as early as 1800 , when the Arab trader Mohamed al Tunisi lived there : he graded the land and its inhabitants according to the colour of skin , the beauty of women , and their sexual mores.22 A broadly similar racist classification became evident in Egyptian occupation of the Nile Valley in the mid-19th century , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difference between Darfur and other parts of Sudan is the significance of land and labour . Under the British and independent governments , very substantial agricultural schemes were established along the Nile and in eastern Sudan , and subsequently in south Kordofan . These involved widespread land alienation and the transformation of a rural peasantry into a wage labour force , much of it seasonally migrant.23 In Darfur there was no land alienation to speak of , and seasonal labour migration is almost entirely within the region , to work on locally-owned smallholdings ( some of which are large by Darfur standards , but do not match the huge registered schemes of the eastern savannas ) . The violent depredation and dispossession inflicted by the Sudanese state in the 1980s and 90s on the Nuba , Blue Nile peoples and adjacent areas of Upper Nile , creating mass internal displacement with the twin economic aims of creating mechanized farms owned by a Khartoum elite and creating a disadvantaged labour force to work them , has no parallel in Darfur . To a significant degree , Darfur has served as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the distances involved , the migration is long-term and not seasonal.24 And the Darfurian labour reserve has never been of strategic economic significance , such that national economic policies have been geared to sustaining it . Male outmigration has left the poorest parts of Darfur with a gender imbalance and a preponderance of female-headed households.25 <p> Labour migration has had implications for the way in with the riverain elite regards westerners . In the 1920s , landowners were reported as saying that just as God ( or the British ) had taken away their slaves , he/they had brought the Fellata . The lowly status of this devout Muslim pilgrim group is closely associated with their low-status labouring occupations , and much the same holds for the Darfurians ( of all ethnicities ) . The term ' abid ' was often applied to them all , indiscriminately , reflecting both racism and their labouring status.26 It is arguable that racist attitudes followed economic stratification , rather than vice versa . In either case , there is a clear association between status and skin colour . <p> Incorporation into a Sudanese @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wider regional identity schema , in which the three attributes of skin colour , economic status and Arab identification all served to categorize populations . Mohamed al Tunisi would feel at home in the contemporary moral geography of Sudan , almost two centuries after his travels . <h> Militarized and Ideological ' Arab ' and ' African ' Identities <p> The complex history of identity formation in Darfur provides rich material for the creation of new ethnic identities . What has happened is that as Darfur has been further incorporated into national Sudanese processes , wider African and Middle Eastern processes , and political globalization , Darfur 's complex identities have been radically and traumatically simplified , creating a polarized ' Arab versus African ' dichotomy that is historically bogus , but disturbingly powerful . The ideological construction of these polarized identities has gone hand-in-hand with the militarization of Darfur , first through the spread of small arms , then through the organization of militia , and finally through full-scale war . The combination of fear and violence is a particularly potent combination for forging simplified and polarized identities , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the war continues . The U.S. government 's determination that the atrocities in Darfur amount to ' genocide ' and the popular use of the terms ' Arab ' and ' African ' by journalists , aid agencies and diplomats , have further entrenched this polarization , to the degree that community leaders for whom the term ' African ' would have been alien even a decade ago , now readily identify themselves as such when dealing with international interlocutors . <p> Internally , this polarization began with some of Darfur 's Arabs . Exposed to the Islamist-Arabism of Khartoum , drawing upon the Arab lineage ideology latent in their Juheiyna identities , and often closely involved in Colonel Gaddafi 's ideologically Arabist enterprises in the 1970s and ' 80s , these men adopted an Arab supremacist ideology . This seems to have been nurtured by Gaddafi 's dreams of an Arab homeland across the Sahara and Sahel ( notwithstanding the Libyan leader 's expansive definition of ' Arab ' which , true to his own Bedouin roots , includes groups such as the Tuareg ) , and by competition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In 1987 , a group of Darfurian Arabs wrote a now-famous letter to Prime Minister Sadiq el Mahdi , demanding a better deal for Darfur 's Arabs . They appealed to him as ' one of their own ' . At one level this was simply a legitimate demand for better political representation and better services . But within it lurked an agenda of Arab supremacism . Subsequently , it has become very difficult to separate the ambitious agenda of a Darfurian Arab homeland from wider and more modest goals , and to identify which documents are real and which are not . But there is no doubt that , twinned with similar ambitions among the Chadian Juheiyna Arabs , there was a political and territorial agenda emerging . This helps explain why some of the first and fiercest clashes of 1987 were in the highland Jebel Marra area of Gulu , a territory which would be clearly indicated a ' Fur ' heartland on any moral geography of the region including that of Sheikh Hilal , reproduced above , whose son Musa has since become infamous as commander @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1987 and again in 2002 and 2004 represent a symbolic strike at the heart of Fur identity and legitimacy , as well as a tactical assault on a Fur resistance stronghold . <p> This newly-politicized Arab identity was also militarized . Three overlapping strands of militarization can be seen . One is the Ansar , the core followers of the Mahdi , who are historically a political , religious and military movement . Between 1970 and 1977 , the Ansar leadership was in exile in Libya , planning its return to power , which it tried in 1976 and failed . Many returned to Sudan in 1977 as part of the ' National Reconciliation ' between Sadiq el Mahdi and Nimeiri , but were not , as they had hoped , absorbed into the national army . Instead , they were settled on farming schemes . Disproportionately drawn from the Baggara tribes , former Ansar fighters were instrumental in the creation of the first Baggara militias in the mid-1980s . A second group of Ansar returned in 1985-6 , following the fall of Nimeiri.27 While in Libya , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Islamic Legion , which drew recruits from across the Sahelian countries.28 This is the second contributor to the militarization of the Bedouin . The Islamic Legion was disbanded after its defeat in Ouadi Doum in 1987 , but its legacy remained . The third contributor was the formation of Arab militias in Chad , which used Darfur as a rear base for their persistent but unsuccessful attempts to take state power . The different political , tribal and ideological strands of this story have yet to be teased apart . Clearly there are important differences within these groups , including a competition for the allegiance of the Ansar fighters between the Umma leadership and the NIF . Gaddafi was also quite capable of treating with non-Arab groups such as the Zaghawa when it suited him , and was quick to recognize the government of Idris Deby when it took power in late 1990 . Although Deby had been a commander of the forces that defeated the Libyan army and Islamic Legion a few years earlier , Gaddafi 's main quarrel was with Hissene Habre . <p> While there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Arab ' identity must not be overstated . The groups involved in the current conflict are overwhelmingly Juheiyna Abbala ( excluding for example the Zayadiya ) , with relatively few Baggara groups ( notably including one part of the Beni Halba , many of whom were armed and mobilized in 1991 to counter the SPLA incursion into Darfur ) . This means that the largest and most influential of Darfur 's Arabs are not involved , including the Baggara Rizeigat , the Habbaniya , the Maaliya and most of the Taaisha . As the conflict continues to spread and escalate , this may change , and there are clear attempts by some in government to bring in all Arab groups ( especially the Rizeigat ) on their sides , and attempts by some on the rebel sides to provoke them . <p> The character of Arab supremacism is manifest in a racist vocabulary and in sexual violence . The term ' zurug ' has long been used in the casual racism of Arabs in Darfur , despite " or perhaps because of " the absence of any discernible differences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thereof are similarly made , again despite or because of the lack of noticeable difference . The term ' ' abid ' , which has long been used by the riverain elites to refer to all Darfurians , has been adopted by some Arab supremacists to refer to non-Arab Darfurians , despite " or because of " its lack of historical precedent . And widespread rape itself is a means of identity destruction or transformation , particularly salient and invasive for Muslim communities . In the early 1990s Nuba Mountains counterinsurgency campaigns , there is ample documentation that rape was used systematically and deliberately for this purpose.29 <p> The creation of ' Africanism ' is more recent than the ascent of Arab supremacism . It owes much to the SPLA , whose leader , John Garang , began to speak of an ' African majority ' in Sudan to counter the Islamist government 's claim that Sudan should be an Islamic state because it had a majority Muslim population . Garang reached out to the Nuba and peoples of southern Blue Nile , for whom ' African ' was an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Nuba clandestine political and cultural organization of the 1970s and early ' 80s , known as Komolo , asserted the Nuba 's right to their own cultural heritage , which they identified as distinctively ' African . ' Under the leadership of Yousif Kuwa , Komolo activist and SPLA governor of the Nuba Mountains , the Nuba witnessed a revival of traditional dancing , music and religion.30 <p> Trapped in a set of identity markers derived from the historical experience of the Nile Valley , a number of educated Darfurian non-Arabs chose ' African ' as the best ticket to political alliance-building . The veteran Darfurian politician Ahmed Diraige had tried to do this in the 1960s , making alliances with the Nuba and Southerners , but had then switched to trying to bring Darfur 's non-Arabs into the Umma Party , hoping thereby to broaden and secularise that party . Daud Bolad , a Fur and a prominent Islamist student leader , switched from one political extreme to the other and joined the SPLA , leading a poorly-planned and militarily disastrous SPLA expedition into Darfur in 1991 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as such inherently distrustful of such labels , was one of the first Darfurian intellectuals to recognize the danger posed by the new Arab Alliance , and has ended up reluctantly donning the ' African ' label . He is now one of the political leaders of Darfur 's Sudan Liberation Movement . <p> The influence of the SPLA on the Darfurian opposition should be acknowledged . What was originally a peasant jacquerie was given political ambition with the assistance of the SPLA . Indeed , the Darfur Liberation Front was renamed the SLA under SPLA influence , and it adopted Garang 's philosophy of the ' New Sudan ' , perhaps more seriously than its mentor . <p> It is a commonplace of ethnographic history that communal violence powerfully helps constitute identity . In times of fear and insecurity , people 's ambit of trust and reciprocity contracts and identity markers that emphasize difference between warring groups are emphasized . Where sexual violence is widespread , markers of race and lineage are salient . Much anecdotal evidence indicates that this is happening today , and that the civilian communities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ African ' label . We can speculate that it serves as a marker of difference from the government and its militia , an expression of hope for solidarity from outside , and " perhaps most significant in the context of forced displacement and threats of further dispossession " a claim to indigeneity and residence rights . <p> From the point of view of the SLA leadership , including the leadership of the communities most seriously affected by atrocity and forced displacement , the term ' African ' has served them well . It is scarcely an exaggeration to say that the depiction of ' Arabs ' killing ' Africans ' in Darfur conjures up , in the mind of a non-Sudanese ( including many people in sub-Saharan Africa ) , a picture of bands of light-skinned Arabs marauding among villages of peaceable black-skinned people of indeterminate religion . In the current context in which ' Arabs ' are identified , in the popular western and sub-Saharan African press , with the instigators of terrorism , it readily labels Darfur 's non-Arabs as victims . <p> From the point of view @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tactically useful . While insisting that the conflict is tribal and local , it turns the moral loading of the term ' Arab ' to its advantage , by appealing to fellow members of the Arab League that Darfur represents another attempt by the west ( and in particular the U.S. ) to demonize the Arab world . In turn this unlocks a regional alliance , for which Darfur stands as proxy for Iraq and Palestine . Looking more widely than Darfur , the term ' Arab ' implies global victimhood . <p> The U.S. determination that Darfur counts as ' genocide ' plays directly into this polarizing scenario . It is easy for self-identified Arab intellectuals in Khartoum ( and elsewhere ) to see this finding as ( yet another ) selective and unfair denigration of Arabs . If , in the confrontation between the Arabs and the Israelis and Americans , Arabs are cast as ' terrorists ' , warranting pre-emptive military action and a range of other restrictions on their rights , now in the context of Africa they are cast as ' genocidaires ' and similarly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intervention and criminal tribunals . Arab editorialists are thus driven both to deny genocide and to accuse the U.S. of double standards , asking why killings in ( for example ) Congo are not similarly labeled . <p> In fact , the U.S. State Department was reluctant to conclude that Darfur counted as genocide , and the Secretary of State insisted , almost in the same breath that he announced ' genocide ' , that it would not change U.S. policy . The impetus for the genocide finding did not come from Washington 's neocons , but rather from liberal human rights activists in alliance with the religious right . The origins of this alliance lie in the politics of support for the SPLA ( with the Israeli lobby as a discrete marriage broker ) and influence trading in Congress , specifically finding an issue ( slavery in Southern Sudan ) that brings together the Black Caucus , the Israeli lobby , the religious right ( for whom Sudan is a crusade ) and the human rights groups ( who began campaigning on this long before the others ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , under the Republicans , had switched from a policy of regime change in Khartoum to a pursuit of a negotiated peace for Southern Sudan . The war in Darfur was a vindication of their thesis that no business could be done with Khartoum 's evildoers . The atrocities were sufficiently swift and graphic , and coincided with the tenth anniversary of the preventable genocide in Rwanda , giving remarkable salience to the genocide claim . Congress passed a resolution , and the State Department prevaricated by sending an investigative team , confident that because there was no evident intent at complete extermination of the target groups , that their lawyers would find some appropriately indeterminate language to express severe outrage , short of moral excommunication of Khartoum ( with which State was still negotiating ) and military intervention . What they had not counted on was that the definition of Genocide in the 1948 Convention is much wider than the lay definition and customary international usage , and includes actions that fall well short of a credible attempt at the absolute annihilation of an ethnic or racial group . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neglected letter of the law , duly found genocide , and the Secretary of State , doubtless judging that it would be more damaging to ignore his lawyers ' public advice , duly made the announcement , and then said that this would not affect U.S. policy . <p> Arrived at more-or-less by accident , the genocide finding has a number of implications . One is that it divides the U.S. from its allies in Europe and Africa . Given that the Sudan peace process is a rare contemporary example of multilateralism ( albeit ad hoc ) and rare example of a success in U.S. foreign policy ( albeit incomplete ) , it is important that this unity is not fully sundered . At present , it appears that the State Department has succeeded in keeping its policy on track , despite being outflanked by the militants in Washington . ( Had the Democrats won in November , we might have faced the ironic situation of a more aggressive U.S. policy . ) The damage has been minimized , but some has been done . <p> Second , the broader @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is one that diplomats have been avoiding for decades , precisely because it creates a vast and indeterminate grey area of atrocity , in which intervention is licensed . A tacit consensus had developed to set the bar higher : now the U.S. has lowered it , and Arab critics are correct : if Darfur is genocide , then so is Congo , Burundi , Uganda , Nigeria and a host of others . The neocons do indeed have another weapon in their armoury of unilateral intervention . Arguably , they did n't need it , already having sufficient reason to intervene on the basis of the September 2002 U.S. National Security doctrine . <p> And thirdly , for Darfur , the genocide finding is being internalized into the politics of the region . This is occurring in the context of considerable external dependence by Darfur 's political organizations and communities . The political organizations have centered their strategies around external engagement . The Islamists in the Justice and Equality Movement have a strategy for regime change , using the atrocities in Darfur to delegitimize the Khartoum government internationally , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The SLA , representing a broad coalition of communities in arms , has yet to develop a full political programme , and is instead largely reacting to events , especially the escalating atrocities since late 2003 . It seeks international intervention as a best option , and international monitoring and guarantees as a second best . The communities it represents , many of them either receiving or seeking international assistance , are also orienting their self-representation to the international audience . They have been provided with a simple and powerful language with which to make their case . <p> The other lenses for analyzing Darfurian identities are too subtle and complex to be of much use for journalists and aid workers . So we are stuck with a polarizing set of ideologically constructed identities , mutually antagonistic . If , as seems likely , these labels become strongly attached , they will hugely complicate the task of reconstructing the social fabric of Darfur " or , given the impossibility of returning to the recent past " they will obstruct the construction of a new Darfurian identity that stresses the common @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <h> Conclusion <p> Let me conclude this essay with two main observations . <p> First , who are the Darfurians ? I argue that Darfur has had a remarkably stable continuous identity as a locus for state formation over several centuries , and is a recognizable political unit in a way that is relatively uncommon in Africa . But the incorporation of Darfur into Sudan , almost as an afterthought , has led not only to the economic and political marginalization of Darfurians , but the near-total neglect of their unique history and identity . Just as damaging for Darfurians as their socio-political marginalization has been the way in which they have been forced to become Sudanese , on terms that are alien to them . To overcome this , we must move to acknowledging a politics of three Sudans : North , South and West . It is probably a nan++ve hope , but a recognition of the unique contribution of Darfurians and the inclusive nature of African identity in Darfur could provide a way out of Sudan 's national predicament of undecided identity . Short of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they have in common , and undertake the hard intellectual labour of establishing their common identity . <p> Second , what we see is the gradual but seemingly inexorable simplification , polarization and cementing of identities in a Manichean mould . Within four generations , a set of negotiable identities have become fixed and magnetized . We should not idealize the past : while ethnic assimilation and the administration of the Sultanate may have been relatively benevolent at the centre , at the southern periphery it was extremely and systematically violent . Similarly , while Sufism is generally and correctly regarded as a tolerant and pacific set of faiths , it also gave birth to Mahdism , which inflicted a period of exceptional turmoil and bloodshed on Sudan , including Darfur . Violence has shaped identity formation in the past in Darfur , just as it is doing today . Also , from the days of the Sultanate , external economic and ideological linkages shaped the nature of state power and fed its centralizing and predatory nature . Today , the sources and nature of those external influences are different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ correlates influence the political and ideological landscape in which Darfur 's conflict is located , including the very language used to describe the adversaries and what they are doing to one another and the unfortunate civilians who are in the line of fire . The humanitarians and human rights activists , as much as the counter-terrorists and diplomats , are part of this process whereby Darfurian identities are traumatically transformed once again . Hopefully there will be a counter-process , which allows for Darfurians to carve out a space in which to reflect on their unique history , identify what they share , and create processes whereby identities are not formed by violence . <h> Endnotes <p> 1 The use of the label ' tribe ' is controversial . But when we are dealing with the subgroups of the Darfurian Arabs , who are ethnically indistinguishable but politically distinct , the term correlates with popular usage and is useful . Hence , ' tribe ' is used in the sense of a political or administrative ethnically-based unit . See Abdel Ghaffar M.

@@2741380 <p> Samuel Huntington 's 1993 article " The Clash of Civilizations ? " and his subsequent book The Clash of Civilizations and the Remaking of World Order ( 1996 ) may seem prescient at first glance . Declaring the onset of " a new phase in global history , " Huntington defined " the fundamental sources of conflict " in the current world , not as economic or ideological in nature , but " cultural . " For Huntington , civilizations each have a primordial cultural identity so that the " major differences in political and economic development among civilizations are clearly rooted in their different cultures . " He warned : " culture and cultural identitiesare shaping the patterns of cohesion , disintegration , and conflict in the post-Cold War worldThe rivalry of the superpowers is replaced by the clash of civilizations " ( Huntington 1993 : 22 ; 1996 : 20 , 28 , 29 ) . " The fault lines between civilizations will be the battle lines of the future , " Huntington predicted , and the two civilizations that are of particular importance in this narrative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> For Huntington , Islam and the West are construed as " highly integrated civilizations , " as bounded entities in which sedimented essences inhere in monolithic groups . Today I want to focus on three problems underlying such a vision . <p> First , the sedimented essences version of " civilization " or " culture " ignores the specific historical processes and particular power relations that have given rise to the recent phenomenon of radical religious expression . Second , the clash of civilization 's story rides roughshod over the diversity of views and the experiences of contention among Muslims . Communities of argument arise over what makes a Muslim a Muslim , what Islam means , and what , if any , its political role should be . Third , Huntington 's analysis neglects the terrains of solidarity and fluidity that exist between Muslims and non-Muslims , the ways in which political communities of various sorts have depended on the cross-fertilization of ideas and practices . Let me elaborate each of these points . <p> First , to take into account historical processes would mean to identify the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fundamentalism , " as radical religious expression is sometimes termed , is not exclusive to Islam . Nor does it have its roots in age-old traditions . Current Islamicist movements are part of a global phenomenon that originates in the late 1970s , and they share with other contemporary movements two key similarities : a ) they resuscitate , invent , or construct an essentialist understanding of political identity based , at least in part , on ascription ; b ) although they have important antecedents , they have emerged as a potent contemporary political force at the same time that international market pressures weakened the economic sovereignty of states and undermined their roles as guarantors of citizens ' welfare . <p> The story may by now be a familiar one : in the 1970s , states began withdrawing economically , privatizing property , reducing or eliminating subsidies , deregulating prices , and ceasing to provide services to which people had become accustomed , felt entitled--and needed . As the state has retreated economically in the Middle East , Islamicist movements have tended to fill in the gaps , providing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; Beinin and Stork 1997 ; Chaudhry 1997 ; Henry and Springborg 2001 ; Medani 1997 ; Sadowski 1987 ; Singerman 1996 ; Vitalis 1997 ; Wickham 1997 , 2002 ; Yamani 2002 ) . Egypt was one of the first Middle Eastern countries to initiate liberalization measures in 1973 . Although such measures could be deemed successful during the oil boom years , they were disastrous in the bust period of the mid-1980s . Liberalization measures exposed Egyptians to a number of imported goods and luxury items at the same time that oil revenues and privatization policies generated a new , American-oriented " parvenu " class ( Sadowski 1987 ) . This new class enjoyed a lifestyle that aroused widespread resentment among the urban poor and middle classes . Liberalization programs created markets , but they also enhanced perceptions of corruption , widened income disparities , and fostered considerable economic suffering . Liberalization also removed safety nets that guaranteed people some security . Rising unemployment , decreases in subsidies , housing problems , and population explosions all contributed to the glaring gap between rich and poor . Strikes grew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a frequent worry " among government officials , and middle and lower class citizens reported economic anxieties ( Sadowski 1987 ) . <p> The undermining of the state as the vehicle of economic development also subverted its role as the carrier of abstract communal solidarities , and it was in this context , often termed " globalization , " that politicized religious movements started being mobilized on the basis of a complex blend of ascriptive and behavioral identifications . What is common to most of these movements is that they express anxieties about corroded values and the loss of communal attachments . They register the " moral panic " ( Comaroff and Comaroff 1999 : 5 ) of citizens longing for a state or community capable of protecting and providing for them . <p> In the Middle Eastern context , Islamicist movements have captured this popular discontent , in part by delivering concrete economic benefits to constituents . They have devised disciplined , effective , skillful organizations for channeling resources and providing goods and services . Some offer housing , books , and health care no longer ( or never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affective attachments in the wake of the failure of Arab states to deliver on Arab nationalist promises . <p> The appeal of Islamicist groups , then , can be historically situated in the changing relations of global capital ( and the concomitant shift from nationalist abstractions to religious ones ) . Invoking a " clash of civilizations " argument is also , as the political scientist Chalmers Johnson notes , " a way of evading responsibility for the ' blowback ' that US imperial projects have generated " ( Johnson , The Nation , October 15 , 2001 ) . Possible sources of " blowback " include the widely shared views that the United States serves as a proxy for Israel , is responsible for the decade of sanctions against Iraqis , shores up corrupt dictators , stations troops in Saudi Arabia specifically , and upholds double standards between official commitments to democracy and equality , on the one hand , and actual political activities , on the other . Current global economic arrangements are also implicated in beliefs about US imperial projects ; they are understood as bringing wealth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the IMF and World Bank , while making many parts of the world more miserable and destitute . <p> The fact that economically incapacitated states in the region encourage expressions of popular discontent in forms that deflect attention away from domestic leaders ' incompetence may also explain the elective affinity between state discourses and some aspects of Islamicist movements . The available idioms through which experiences of common belonging to a people become institutionalized in the post-Fordist , post-colonial world are confined to what the state will tolerate and what the Islamicists have won . Thus demonstrations of Muslim piety combine with consensual understandings of anti-American and pro-Palestinian solidarities in officials ' speeches and in mass demonstrations . Islamicism has become a coherent anti-imperialist doctrine and a way of re-establishing community . It offers visions of an equitable , just , socially responsible way of life , much as the failed , discredited Arab nationalist regimes of the 1950s and 60s did . <p> To some extent the success of the Islamicist movements also has to be attributed to the state 's elimination of leftist opposition by means of incarceration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example , the regimes of Nasir and Sadat worked actively to demobilize the working class . Sadat found tactical allies among the Muslim Brotherhood and among the newly growing radical Islamic movements in universities . He released imprisoned Muslim Brothers in 1972-73 , and encouraged them to attack leftists , whom he regarded as his major political adversary ( Waterbury 1983 ; Sadowski 1987 ) . In Yemen , unification between North and South was followed by the Northern ruling party 's consistent assault on its Southern Socialist partners . In 1992-93 , there were approximately 150-160 assassination attempts against members of the Yemeni Socialist Party ( YSP--most of them carried out by self-identified radical Islamicists who were encouraged financially and politically by the regime.2 <p> Viewing the emergence and appeal of Islamicist movements historically thus compels us to come to terms with the post-Fordist economic world in which the state 's economic sovereignty has been undermined globally with consequences for the forms of solidarity and expressions of community currently politicizing citizens in a number of places . A historical account also requires us to recognize the absence of alternative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deliver both on their pan-Arab promises and to produce effective state-centered projects for development . With the disintegration of the Soviet Union and the global decline of Soviet ideology as an alternative paradigm to liberal capitalism , Islamicism provides a critical vision of the world and a sense of hope for some people . Islamicist positions on social justice , based on mechanisms of redistribution such as the Islamic zakat taxes , avoid the radical land reform projects of old ; they also tend to respect the concept of private property and encourage profit as an appropriate outcome for entrepreneurial activity ( Sadowski 1997 ; Kepel 2002 ) . Islamicists can thus appeal to the middle classes and to the urban poor , even though the credibility of Islamicist solutions to economic problems has been undermined by the failure of some Islamicist firms to deliver on their financial promises.3 <h> Part Two : Contention Among Muslims <p> Despite the success of Islamicists in providing the adversarial idioms and resonant political critiques , the struggle among nominally Muslim citizens and Islamicist adherents is as pronounced as the solidarities an Islamicist adversarial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a set of religious beliefs , an ascriptive attachment , a " cultural " identification , a state classification , a set of recognizable activities , or none of the above . There are those who see a separation of mosque and state as fundamental , and those who advocate their conjuncture . There are those who think the sharia should be the source of legislation , those who view it as a source , and those who wish it were irrelevant to contemporary law . There are countries where the ulama or religious elite is independent of the state , places where mosque sermons are controlled by the state , and places where the ulama is coterminous with the state . There are , in short , vigorous communities of argument and plural varieties of social and political practice . This plurality makes any invocation of a single political doctrine of Islam empirically untenable and theoretically meaningless . We have to keep this sense of variety and plurality in mind when thinking about political patterns and the terrains of solidarity that might animate future political life.4 <h> Part Three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Rule of Law , and Human Rights <p> Rather than discussing reified categories such as Islam and democracy in general , we should talk , as the theorist Gudrun Kr+mer encourages us to do , about " Muslims living and theorizing under specific historical circumstances " ( Kr+mer 1997 : 72 ) . This may seem obvious , but it is often hard to do , in part because many Muslim authors represent their " views as ' the position of Islam ' " ( Kr+mer 1997 : 72 ) . <p> In addition , some Islamicists may end up adopting the strategic option of democracy because leaders calculate that it is in their interest to do so . Such rational calculations explain how the theologically-minded Belgian Catholic movement , for example , despite members ' theocratic inclinations and their lack of commitment to democracy , ended up supporting democratic institutions ( Kalyvas 1998 ) . In other words , a discussion of ideas , values or shared political commitments may exaggerate the importance of particular ways of thinking while underestimating the salience of common strategic interests and trade-offs--the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ political leaders who share the same vocation ( but perhaps not the same values ) do when making decisions . <p> Keeping these points in mind , let me suggest three shared understandings that might constitute a terrain of solidarity between Islamicists and liberals ( I claim membership in neither group ) : First , conservative ulama and moderate Muslim Brothers ( in Egypt , Jordan , Tunisia , and Yemen ) hold ideas that are fundamentally modern ( Kr+mer 1997 : 74 ; see also Chakrabarty 2000 ) .5 Implementing the sharia , according to these theorists , means building a state whose common bureaucratic institutions are designed to provide goods and services in return for citizens ' allegiance and obedience . Humans , endowed by God with reason , have the ability to interpret correctly the purposes of the sharia and therefore to define the precise contours and functional tasks state institutions will assume . In this light , the adoption of democratic practices or categories may be " acceptable , recommended , or even mandatory , " as long as these do not contravene Islamic principles ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is the admissibility of democratic norms and procedures in the process of constructing institutions . A fundamental concern of many contemporary Muslims is the need to check the arbitrary powers of leaders and institute the rule of law , and strict application of the sharia is seen by many as a way of forefending against tyranny while ensuring procedural justice . Whatever problems one might see in this proposition , criticisms of despotism and corruption animate the works of both radical and reform-minded Islamicists ( as well as those of secularists ) . Identifying tyranny as a key spiritual and political problem on the grounds that it treats men as gods when there is only one God , provides the justification for rendering dictators and those who work for them apostates.6 Although some groups still advocate the restoration of a " caliphate , " many groups , including the Muslim Brothers , use the term in ways analogous to a modern president who is entrusted to execute God 's law as a fallible human agent and an accountable , political representative of the Muslim community . Thus many Muslim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ madaniyya ( a civil state ) rather than a theocracy ruled by the ulama or an authoritarian state ruled by the military . In Yemen , moderate Islamicists also stress the importance of a shura whose actual duties look less like the Prophet Muhammad 's version of a consultative body and more like a Western Parliament . ( The key figure here is Yasin Abd al-Aziz 1999 : 63-116 . ) Many authors in Yemen and elsewhere accept the importance of a separation of powers in which the executive , the legislature , and the judiciary keep each other in check . <p> Third , moderate , pragmatic Islamicists and many self-identified Muslim authors also express concerns about protecting human rights ( although there are also lively debates on the extent to which the importation of allegedly Western understandings of human rights contradict the sharia and/or are used opportunistically by Western NGOs , journalists , and governments to justify intervention ) .7 Especially in their role as oppositional political figures , moderate Islamicists have demanded the safeguarding of individual rights and civil liberties from government intrusion , and the human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Conclusions : <p> The vast majority of people in the Middle East probably never ceased to consider themselves Muslim , even at the apogee of secular nationalist movements . But before the 1970s , most Muslims did not seem to identify primarily as Muslims , or rather , that identity did not override other forms of political identification . Disillusionment with the performance of states in the 1970s and the creation of parvenu classes that exemplified the ostentatious excesses of the " haves " in contrast to the impoverishment of the " have nots " generated widespread discontent . This discontent was exacerbated with the debt crisis of the 1980s , the decline in the price of oil , and the IMF-imposed restructuring projects that limited state expenditures . At a time when the distributive capabilities of states were undermined and leaders were increasingly perceived to be venal and corrupt , the popularity of Islamicists movements rose considerably . The messages-calls for social equity , political transparency and accountability , and moral piety-were resonant , critical alternatives that gave many a sense of belonging to a common political project with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ establish a direct causal relationship between economic suffering and political Islamicist movements , but we might acknowledge that fundamentalisms are " intimately connected with material conditions and disaffection " without arguing that such conditions fully explain " the appeal of fundamentalist ideas " ( Euben 1999 : 89 ) . <p> To focus on the economic incentives , discursive content , and political-affective impulses that have underpinned Islamicist projects is not to suggest that there is a single , unified political doctrine of Islam . Islamicists differ from non-Islamicists and from one another . There are pragmatically minded Muslim Brotherhood adherents and radically minded , militantly inclined Islamicists . There are secularists and pious practitioners . Reifying " Islam " not only denies the empirical world of plurality and diversity , it also proves politically dangerous , by making " Islam " into an object rather than a set of polyvalent activities whose practitioners have divergent visions , fantasies , understandings , and interests . <p> Moreover , the moderate , pragmatic Islamicists have come to articulate recognizable aspects of a modern state and a democratic politics : government accountability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ separation of powers , and the protection of human rights . As Gudrun Kr+mer points out , despite these explicit commitments , Muslim Brothers are not , strictly speaking liberals , if " liberalism " also means " religious indifference " ( Kr+mer 1997 : 80 ) . But their moral vocabularies , expressions of entitlement , and political practices share important characteristics with liberal formulations of democratic institution building . <p> Thinking about shared terrains between Islamicists and non-Islamicists and between Muslims and non-Muslims does not mean riding roughshod over important disagreements , nor does it require " fudging " consensus where consensus does not reside . If democrats are to take their own commitments to democratic political life seriously , then they ( we ) have to embrace the variety and agonistic , contentious politics that allows for differences to thrive . <p> Focusing exclusively on Islamicists , moreover , does a disservice to other groups and individuals in the Middle East whose ideals may be less resonant with current public opinions , but whose practices forge the conditions of possibility through which future political life may also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ignoring historical processes and specific relations of political power , the treatment of culture in political science has downplayed the heterogeneous ways people experience the social order within and among groups , while exaggerating the commonality , constancy , and permanence of intra-group beliefs and values . As a result , cultural essentialist explanations of political outcomes such as ethnic or religious violence tend to naturalize categories of groupness , rather than exploring the conditions under which such experiences of groupness come to seem natural when they do ( See Wedeen 2002 ) . <h> Endnotes <p> 1 This essay has benefited from discussions with Nadia Abu El-Haj , Saba Mahmood , Jar Allah Umar , Moishe Postone , Don Reneau , and Anna Wuerth .

@@2741381 <p> Beyond Militarism , Arms Races and Arms ControlMary Kaldor , Professor and Director of the Programme on Global Civil Society ; London School of Economics <p> Introduction <p> Since the end of the Cold War , a profound restructuring of armed forces has taken place . During the Cold War period , armed forces tended to resemble each other all over the world . They were disciplined , hierarchical , and technology intensive . There were , of course , guerrilla and/or terrorist groups but they were considered marginal and their demand for weapons was small in relation to the overall demand for weapons . <p> The Cold War could be described as the final stage of what has come to be known as modernity , or to use Anthony Giddens ' terminology , the final stages of the first phase of modernity . By modernity , I mean that period of human development that began somewhere between the fifteenth and the eighteenth centuries , characterised by the development of science and technology , the nation state , modern industry , and , I would argue , Clausewitzean or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between states , fought by armed forces , for state interest ; the type of war that was theorised so brilliantly by Clausewitz . The development of modern war can not be disentangled from the development of modern states . It was in war that European states , which were to provide the model for other states , established their monopoly of organised violence within the territorial confines of the state ; they eliminated competitors , centralised administration , increased taxation and forms of borrowing , and , above all , created an idea of the state as the organisation responsible for protection of borders against other states and for upholding a rule of law within the state . The sharp distinctions between the military and civilians , public and private , internal and external , are a product of these developments . As Charles Tilly put it in a famous phrase : ' States made war and war made the state ' . <p> After 1945 , the whole world was parcelled up into individual states , each with their own currency and their own armed forces . Each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ East and non-aligned ) and within each bloc , there were transfers of weapons and other types of military assistance according to a very similar model of warfare . The idea of war and of preparations for war was bound up with the ways in which states established their political legitimacy . <p> Since the end of the Cold War , military spending by governments has fallen substantially . But what we have witnessed is less a contraction of military forces than a restructuring and increased diversity of types of military forces . There is a parallel with the pre-modern period , which was also characterised by a diversity of military forces - feudal levies , citizens militias , mercenaries , pirates , for example - and by a corresponding variety of types of warfare . <p> Two inter-linked developments have been critical , in my view , in bringing about these changes . One is the sheer destructiveness of modern warfare . As all types of weapons have become more lethal and/or more accurate , decisive military victory has become more and more difficult . The scale of destruction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is almost unbearable to contemplate . The Cold War could be understood as a way of evading or psychologically suppressing the implications of that destructiveness . Through the system of deterrence , the idea of modern war was kept alive in the imagination and helped to sustain the legitimacy and discipline of modern states . The military planners and scenario builders imagined wars , even more destructive than World War II , and developed competitive new technologies that , in theory , would be used in such wars . There were , of course , real wars and some 5 million people have died in wars in every decade since 1945 but , among the dominant powers , these were regarded as ' not-war ' or marginal to the main contingency - a global inter-state clash . With the end of the Cold War , we have to come to terms with the impossibility of wars of the modern type . <p> The second development is the process known as globalisation . By globalisation , I mean increasing interconnectedness , the shrinking of distance and time , as a result @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) and air travel . A central issue for theorists of globalisation has to do with the implications for the modern state ( See Held ) . Some argue that the state has become an anachronism and that we are moving towards a single world community . Some take the opposite view , that globalisation is an invention of the state and can easily be reversed . Yet others insist that globalisation does not mean the end of the state but rather its transformation . I share the last position but I would argue that there is no single method of transformation . States are changing in a variety of ways and , moreover , these changes , I shall argue , are bound up with changes in the types of armed forces and the forms of warfare . <p> The terms ' militarism ' , ' arms races ' and ' arms control ' are expressions drawn from the Cold War era and before . Militarism refers to excessive levels of military spending by the state and excessive influence of armed forces over civilian life . ' Arms races @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forces . ' Arms control ' refers to the process of treaty making between states based on the assumption that stability can best be preserved through a ' balance of power ( or terror ) ' between states . <p> In this essay , I shall distinguish between the different types of armed forces that are emerging in the post-Cold War world , only some of which can be characterised in terms of militarism and arms races , and discuss how they are loosely associated with different modes of state transformation and different forms of warfare . I have identified four different types of armed forces . They could be described as Weberian idealtypes . They are probably not comprehensive and no single example exactly fits a particular type . There is also a lot of overlap . The point is to provide a schematic account of what is happening in the field of warfare so as to be able to offer some new ways of thinking about the possibilities for controlling or limiting the means of warfare and why we need a new terminology beyond militarism , arms races @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that has been increasingly accorded to international law , particularly humanitarian law , offers a possible way forward . <p> Netforce : Informal or Privatised Armed Forces <p> A typical new phenomenon is armed networks of non-state and state actors . They include : para-military groups organised around a charismatic leader , warlords who control particular areas , terrorist cells , fanatic volunteers like the Mujahadeen , organised criminal groups , units of regular forces or other security services , as well as mercenaries and private military companies . <p> The form of warfare that is waged by these networks is what I call ' new war ' ( Kaldor 1999 ) . New wars , which take place in the Balkans , Africa , Central Asia and other places , are sometimes called internal or civil wars to distinguish them from intra-state or Clausewitzean war . I think this terminology is inappropriate for a number of reasons . First , the networks cross borders . One of the typical features of the ' new wars ' is the key role played by Diaspora groups either far away ( Sudanese @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ workers in Western Europe , immigrant groups in the new ' melting pot ' nations like North America or Oceania ) or in neighbouring states ( Serbs in Croatia and Bosnia , Tutsis in Burundi or the DRC ) . Secondly , the wars involve an array of global actors - foreign mercenaries and volunteers , Diaspora supporters , neighbouring states , not to mention the humanitarian actors such as aid agencies , NGOs or reporters . <p> And thirdly , and most importantly , the ' new wars ' tend to be concentrated in areas where the modern state is unravelling and where the distinctions between internal and external , public and private , no longer have the same meaning . Such areas are characterised by what are called frail or failing states , quasi or shadow states . These are states , formally recognised by the outside world , with some of the trappings of statehood - an incomplete administrative apparatus , a flag , sometimes a currency - but where those trappings do not express control over territory and where access to the state apparatus is about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ states where the monopoly of legitimate organised violence is eroding . <p> In many of the areas where new wars take place , it is possible to observe a process that is almost the reverse of the process through which modern states were constructed . Taxes fall because of declining investment and production , increased corruption and clientilism , or declining legitimacy . The declining tax revenue leads to growing dependence both on external sources and on private sources , through , for example , rent seeking or criminal activities . Reductions in public expenditure as a result of the shrinking fiscal base as well as pressures from external donors for macro-economic stabilisation and liberalisation ( which also may reduce export revenues ) further erode legitimacy . A growing informal economy associated with increased inequalities , unemployment and rural-urban migration , combined with the loss of legitimacy , weakens the rule of law and may lead to the re-emergence of privatised forms of violence : organised crime and the substitution of ' protection ' for taxation ; vigilantes ; private security guards protecting economic facilities , especially international companies ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particular , reductions in security expenditure , often encouraged by external donors for the best of motives , may lead to break away groups of redundant soldiers and policemen seeking alternative employment . <p> Of course , the networks that engage in new wars are not all to be found in these failing states . They include nodes in advanced industrial countries and , in the inner cities of the West , it is possible to observe gang warfare that has many of the characteristics of ' new wars ' . Nevertheless , this type of state provides a fertile environment for these types of network . <p> There are three main characteristics of the ' new wars ' . First of all , I use the term ' war ' to emphasise the political character of the new wars , even though they could also be described as organised crime ( illegal or private violence ) or as massive violations of human rights ( violence against civilians ) . Because networks are loose horizontal coalitions , unlike vertical disciplined armies of the past , a shared narrative , often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is an important organising mechanism . In the case of the netforce , the networks engaged in the new wars , what holds them together is a generally an extreme political ideology based on the exclusive claim to state power on the basis of identity - ethnic chauvinism or religious communalism . I stress access to state power because these ideologies are not about substantive grievances , such as language rights or religious rights , although these may be indirectly important ; rather they are about control of power and resources for an exclusively defined group of people . <p> I take the view that these ideologies are politically constituted . Even though they are based on pre-existing cleavages of tribe , nation and religion , and even though they may make use of memories and experiences of past injustices , they are constructed or accentuated for the purpose of political mobilisation . <p> Modern communications are important for the new networks both as a way of organising the network and as a form of mobilisation . Constructions of the past are developed and disseminated through radio , videos and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rwanda . In Serbia , television was effectively used to remind people of the injustices of the past - the defeat of the Serbs by the Turks in 1389 and the fascist Croat treatment of Serbs during World War II . In the Middle East , videocassettes of Bin Laden 's speeches circulate widely . The effect of television and radio in speeding up mobilisation especially in the countryside or among newly arrived urban migrants , who do not have the reading habit , should not be underestimated . There is an important contrast here with nineteenth century ' imagined communities ' which were propagated through the print media and involved the intellectual classes . The more populist electronic media are designed to appeal primarily to the least educated members of the public . In general , it is states that control the radio and television . But non-state groups can make use of other forms of media : Diaspora broadcasts through satellite television , which were important in Kosovo ; the circulation of videos ; or local radio in areas under political control . <p> A second characteristic of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a form of political mobilisation . In what I have called wars between states , the aim of war was , to quote Clausewitz , ' to compel an opponent to fulfil our will ' . In general this was achieved through the military capture of territory and victory in battle . People were mobilised to participate in the war effort - to join the army or to produce weapons and uniforms . In the new wars , mobilising people is the aim of the war effort ; the point of the violence is not so much directed against the enemy ; rather the aim is to expand the networks of extremism . Generally the strategy is to control territory through political means and military means are used to kill , expel or silence those who might challenge control . This is why the warring parties use techniques of terror , ethnic cleansing or genocide as deliberate war strategies . In the new wars , battles are rare and violence is directed against civilians . Violations of humanitarian and human rights law are not a side effect of war but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the casualties in the new wars are civilian and the number of refugees and displaced persons per conflict has risen steadily . <p> The strategy is to gain political power through sowing fear and hatred , to create a climate of terror , to eliminate moderate voices and to defeat tolerance . The political ideologies of exclusive nationalism or religious communalism are generated through violence . It is generally assumed that extreme ideologies , based on exclusive identities - Serb nationalism , for example , or fundamentalist Islam - are the cause of war . Rather , the spread and strengthening of these ideologies are the consequence of war . ' The war had to be so bloody ' , Bosnians will tell you , ' because we did not hate each other ; we had to be taught to hate each other . ' <p> A third characteristic of the new wars is the type of economy they generate . Because these networks flourish in states where systems of taxation have collapsed and where little new wealth is being created , and where the wars destroy physical infrastructure , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prohibits investment , they have to seek alternative , exploitative forms of financing . They raise money through loot and plunder , through illegal trading in drugs , illegal immigrants , cigarettes and alcohol , through " taxing " humanitarian assistance , through support from sympathetic states and through remittances from members of the networks . All of these types of economic activity are predatory and depend on an atmosphere of insecurity . Indeed , the new wars can be described as a central source of the globalised informal economy - the transnational criminal and semi-legal economy that represents the underside of globalisation . <p> The logical conclusion that can be drawn from these three characteristics is that the new wars are very difficult to contain and very difficult to end . They spread through refugees and displaced persons , through criminal networks , and through the extremist viruses they nurture . We can observe growing clusters of warfare in Africa , the Middle East , Central Asia or the Caucasus . The wars represent a defeat for democratic politics , and each bout of warfare strengthens those networks with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There are no clear victories or defeats because the warring parties are sustained both politically and economically by continuing violence . The wars speed up the process of state unravelling ; they destroy what remains of productive activities , they undermine legitimacy , and they foster criminality . The areas where conflicts have lasted longest have generated cultures of violence , as in the jihad culture taught in religious schools in Pakistan and Afghanistan or among the Tamils of Sri Lanka , where young children are taught to be martyrs and where killing is understood as an offering to God . In the instructions found in the car of the hijackers in Boston 's Logan Airport , it is written : ' If God grants any one of you a slaughter , you should perform it as an offering on behalf of your father and mother , for they are owed by you . If you slaughter , you should plunder those you slaughter , for that is a sanctioned custom of the Prophet 's . ' <p> It should be noted that there are other private or informal forces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in many of the new wars , villages or municipalities establish citizens ' militias to defend local people - this was the case in among some groups in Rwanda and also in Tuzla and Zenica during the Bosnian war . There are also more traditional guerrilla groups , whose strategy is to gain political control through winning hearts and minds rather than through sowing fear and hatred ; hence they attack agents of the state and not civilians , at least in theory . Finally , there are numerous private security companies , often established to protect multinational companies in difficult places , and mercenaries , who fight for money ; tactics and forms of warfare , in these cases , depend largely on the paymasters . <p> It could be argued that if September 11 had not happened , the American military-industrial complex might have had to invent it . Indeed , what happened on September 11 could have come out of what seemed to be the wild fantasies of ' asymmetric threats ' that were developed by American strategic analysts as they sought a new military role @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ War . A reporter for the London Observer claimed to have found in one of the headquarters for terrorist training in Afghanistan , a photocopy of the ' terrorist cookbook ' which circulates among the American fundamentalist right . <p> World military spending declined by one third in the decade after 1989 . America military spending also declined but by less than the global average and began to rise again after 1998 . As of the year 2000 , American military spending in real terms is equivalent to its spending in 1980 , just before the Reagan military build-up . More importantly , what took place during the 1990s was a radical shift in the structure of US military expenditure . Spending on military research and development declined less than overall military spending and has increased faster since 1998 . As of 2000 , US military R&amp;D spending is 47% higher in real terms than in 1980 ( SIPRI 2001 ) . Instead of ushering in a period of downsizing , disarmament and conversion ( although some of that did take place at local levels in the US ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ technological effort to apply information technology to military purposes , known as the Revolution in Military Affairs ( RMA ) . <p> Indeed , it can be argued that the cuts of the early 1990s are equivalent to the reductions that can be expected in the normal post-1945 US military procurement cycle . The high points in the procurement cycle were in the early 1950s , late 1960s and early 1970s , and the early 1980s . During the downturns , military R&amp;D is always sustained , designing and developing the systems to be procured in the next upturn . As new systems reach the more expensive development and procurement phases , this has always coincided with renewed preoccupations with threats of various kinds . The North Korean invasion of South Korea in 1950 , for example , occurred at a moment when pressure to increase military spending was mounting as a result of over-capacity in the arms industry , especially the aircraft industry , and of fears about the return of mass unemployment after the end of the post-war consumer boom . NSC 68 , the famous report , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Soviet threat , was published just before the Korean invasion . A parallel can be drawn with the current situation since the systems developed under the rubric of the RMA are reaching the development and production phase and there is over-capacity in the aerospace industry . <p> During the 1990 's , great efforts were expended in ' imagining ' new ' worst-case scenarios ' and new post-Soviet threats . With the collapse of the Soviet military-industrial complex , strategic planners have come up with all sorts of inventive new ways of attacking America , through spreading viruses , poisoning water systems , causing the collapse of the banking system , disrupting air traffic control or power transmission . Of particular importance has been the idea of state-sponsored terrorism and the notion of ' rogue states ' who sponsor terrorism and acquire long range missiles as well as WMD ( Weapons of Mass Destruction ) . These new threats emanating from a collapsing Russia or from Islamic fundamentalism are known as ' asymmetric ' threats as weaker states or groups develop WMD or other horrific techniques to attack US vulnerabilities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ September 11 , and the subsequent anthrax scare , seems like a confirmation of these anticipations of horror . <p> The cruise missile , the target of peace movement campaigns in the 1980s , can be described as the ' paradigmatic ' weapon of RMA . It is a ' system that can be delivered by a variety of platforms ( i.e. , all three services can use it ) and strike in a precise manner and with low collateral damage ' ( Freedman , 1998 : 70 ) . It was the cruise missile that was used in the summer of 1998 against terrorist camps in Afghanistan and an alleged chemical weapons factory in Sudan after the bombings of the US embassies in Kenya and Uganda . <p> Enthusiasts for RMA suggest the introduction of information technology is akin to the introduction of the stirrup or gunpowder in its implications for warfare . Unlike these earlier innovations , however , RMA takes place within the traditional force structures inherited from the past . Earlier innovations were only adopted when force structures changed in such a way as to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the stirrup depended on the evolution of feudal relations and the emergence of knights , while gunpowder was only applied to warfare after capitalist development made possible the use of mercenaries . <p> The origins of the RMA can be traced to the 1970s when the effect of growing accuracy and lethality of munitions was observed in the wars in Vietnam and the Middle East . The so-called military reformers suggested that this implied an historic shift to the defence . The offensive manoeuvres characteristic of World War II and planned in Europe for World War III were no longer possible since tanks and aircraft were almost as vulnerable as troops had been in World War I. In particular , it was argued that this historic shift lessened the need for nuclear weapons to compensate for Soviet conventional superiority since this could be nullified by improvements in conventional defence . The opponents of this view argued that the offence was even more important in the context of information technology because it made possible unmanned guided offensive weapons and because of the importance of area destruction munitions , which could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ view that prevailed , perhaps because it left force structures undisturbed and sustained defence companies , retaining an emphasis on offensive manoeuvres and delivery platforms in a more or less linear extension from the strategic bombing missions of World War II . <p> The consequence was what became known as ' emerging technologies ' in the 1980s . These were long-range strike weapons using conventional munitions that were nearly as lethal as nuclear weapons . Terms such as ' deep strike ' , ' airland battle ' , and the ' maritime strategy ' became the buzzwords of the 1980s . The idea was that the West would meet any Soviet attack by striking deep into Soviet territory . When Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990 and the Pentagon was asked to present the military options , they were able to roll out a plan that had been prepared in the event of a southward Soviet thrust . <p> The Gulf war provided a model for what can be described as casualty-free war - that is to say the use of high technology either directly to attack an enemy or to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Northern Alliance in Afghanistan . The idea now is that this high-tech warfare can be used against ' rogue states ' sponsoring terrorists . The same techniques were used against Iraq in December 1998 , in Yugoslavia in 1999 and now in Afghanistan . They satisfy a confluence of interests . They fulfil the needs of the scientists , engineers and companies that provide an infrastructure for the American military effort . They allow for a continuation of the imaginary war of the Cold War period from the point of view of Americans . They do not involve American casualties , and they can be watched on television and demonstrate the determination and power of the United States government - the ' spectacles ' as Der Derian has put it , that ' serve to deny imperial decline ' . It is this imaginary character from an American perspective that explains Jean Baudrillard 's famous remark that the Gulf War did not happen . <p> The programme for national missile defence has to be understood in the same vein . Even if the system can not work , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United States to engage in casualty-free war without fear of retaliation . This notion is evident from the way in which Donald Rumsfeld , the US defence secretary , talks about how NMD will enhance deterrence through a combination of defensive and offensive measures . The weakness of deterrence was always the problem of credibility ; a problem that leads to more and more useable nuclear weapons . With casualty-free war , the credibility of US action is more convincing ; after all , it is said , that the attack on the World Trade Towers was equivalent to the use of a sub-strategic nuclear weapon . NMD , at least psychologically , extends the possibilities for casualty-free war . <p> However , from the point of view of the victims , these wars are very real and not so different from new wars . However precise the strikes , it is impossible to avoid ' mistakes ' or ' collateral damage ' . It does not make civilian casualties any more palatable to be told they were not intended . Moreover , the destruction of physical infrastructure and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the case of proxies , results in many more indirect casualties . In the case of the Gulf War , direct Iraqi casualties can probably be numbered in the tens of thousands but the destruction of physical infrastructure and the ensuing wars with the Kurds and the Shiites caused hundreds of thousands of further casualties and seem to have entrenched the vicious and dangerous rule of Saddam Hussein . In the current war in Afghanistan , there have probably been thousands of casualties , both civilian and military as well as thousands of people fleeing their homes and a humanitarian disaster because aid agencies have not been able to enter the country . The help provided to the hated Northern Alliance reduces the prospects of a broad-based Afghan government that might begin a process of stabilisation . Far from extending support for democratic values , casualty-free war shows that American lives are privileged over the lives of others and contributes to a perception of the United States as a global bully . <p> Terms like imperialism are , however , misleading . The United States is best characterised not as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' . It is the only state , in this globalised world , that still has the capacity to act unilaterally . Its behaviour is determined less by imperial considerations than by concerns about its own domestic public opinion . Casualty-free war is also in a sense a form of political mobilisation . It is about satisfying various domestic constituencies , not about influencing the rest of the world , even though such actions have a profound impact on the rest of the world . <p> Neo-Modern Militarism <p> Neo-modern militarism refers to the evolution of classical military forces in large transition states . These are states that are undergoing a transition from a centralised economy to a more internationally open market-oriented system and , yet , which are large enough to retain a sizeable state sector . Typical examples are Russia , India and China . They are not large enough to challenge the US and they are constrained by many of the imperatives of globalisation , subject to many of the pressures that are experienced by frail or failing states . They tend to adopt extreme ideologies that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Russian or Hindu chauvinism , for example . And there are often direct links to and even co-operation with the shadier networks , especially in Russia . Israel should probably also be included in this category , although its capacity to retain a sizeable military sector is due less to its size than to its dependence on the United States . <p> These states have retained their military forces , including nuclear weapons . In the case of India , there has been a significant increase in military spending throughout the 1990s and it could be argued that the term ' arms race ' could be applied to India and Pakistan , especially after the 1998 nuclear tests . Pakistan , however , could be said to be closer to the networks of the new wars with its links to militants in Kashmir and Afghanistan ; in other words somewhere between netforce and neo-modern militarism . In the case of Russia , there was a dramatic contraction of military spending after the break-up of the Soviet Union and a deep crisis in the military-industrial complex . But pressure to increase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Chechnya is leading to a reassessment of the relative importance of conventional versus nuclear weapons . The proposed cuts in nuclear weapons discussed between Putin and Bush will release funds for conventional improvements . China is also engaged in military expansion especially since 1998 , when the military were prohibited from engaging in commercial activities . Given the reductions in Russian nuclear capabilities and the new generation of Chinese systems , China will come to look more like a competitor to Russia , especially in the nuclear field . <p> The type of warfare that is associated with neo-modern militarism is either limited inter-state warfare or counter-insurgency . These states envisage wars on the classic Clausewitzean model . They engage in counter-insurgency in order to defeat extremist networks as in Chechnya or Kashmir . Or they prepare for the defence of borders against other states , as in the case of the Kargil war between India and Pakistan in 1998 . Unlike the United States , these states are prepared to risk casualties and , in the case of the Chechen war , Russian casualties have been extremely high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from tanks , helicopters or artillery , as well as population displacement to ' clean ' areas of extremists or ' terrorists ' . The impact on civilians is thus very similar to the impact of the ' new wars ' . Yet precisely because of the growing destructiveness of all types of weapons and the consequent difficulty of overcoming defensive positions , military victory against an armed opponent is very hard to achieve . Grozny has virtually been reduced to rubble . Yet still resistance persists . <p> The networks have understood that they can not take territory militarily , only through political means , and the point of the violence is to contribute to those political means . The states engaged in neo-modern militarism are still under the illusion that they can win militarily . The consequence is either self-imposed limits , as in the case of inter-state war , or exacerbation of ' new wars ' as in the case of Kashmir , Chechnya or Palestine , where counter-insurgency merely contributes to the political polarising process of fear and hate . In other words , the utility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an opponent to fulfil our will ' is open to question nowadays . <p> Protectionforce : **31;271;TOOLONG <p> An important trend in the last decade has been the increase in peacekeeping operations . At the start of the decade , there were only eight United Nations peacekeeping operations ; they involved some 10,000 troops . As of the end of 2000 , there were 15 United Nations operations involving some 38,000 military troops ( Global Civil Society 2001 ) . In addition , a number of regional organisations were engaged in peace-keeping : NATO in Bosnia , Kosovo and Macedonia ; the Commonwealth of Independent States ( CIS ) , mainly Russia , in Tajikistan , Transdinestr , Abkhazia , and South Ossetia ; the Economic Community of West African States ( ECOWAS ) in Sierra Leone , Liberia and Guinea . <p> Peacekeeping has not only increased in scale ; there have been important changes in the tasks peacekeepers are asked to perform and in the way we think about peacekeeping . During the Cold war period , peacekeeping was based on the assumption that wars were of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the warring parties and to monitor cease-fires on the basis of agreements . Peacekeeping was sharply distinguished from peace enforcement , which was equated with war fighting , i.e. intervening in a war on one side , authorised under Chapter VIII of the UN Charter . <p> In terms of organisation , peacekeeping has more in common with the networks than with classic military forces . Peacekeeping forces are generally loose transnational coalitions . Although they usually have a clearly defined multinational command system , peacekeepers are also subject to national commands , which erodes the vertical character of the command system . Because they are often far away from the decision-makers and because of the nature of their tasks , individual initiative is often more important than unquestioning obedience . Moreover , peacekeepers have to work together with a range of other agencies , international organisations like UNHCR or UNDP and also NGOs involved in humanitarian assistance or conflict resolution . A shared normative narrative based on humanitarian principles is critical in holding the networks together . <p> The new tasks for peace-keepers include the protection of safe havens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ convoys delivering humanitarian assistance , disarmament and demobilisation , providing a secure environment for elections or for the return of refugees and displaced persons , or capturing war criminals . These tasks reflect the changes in the nature of the warfare . New terms like ' second-generation peace-keeping ' , ' wider peace-keeping ' or ' robust ' peacekeeping have been used to describe these new roles . Peacekeepers nowadays operate in the context of continuing wars or insecure post-conflict situations , and they are more likely to risk casualties than were traditional peacekeepers . <p> A number of recent reports have emphasised that the new role of peace-keeping is , first and foremost , the protection of civilians since they are the main targets of the new wars ( Brahimi ) . The new peacekeeping is indeed somewhere between traditional peacekeeping ( separating sides ) and peace enforcement ( taking sides ) . I have argued that outright military victory is very very difficult nowadays , at least if we are unwilling to contemplate mass destruction . The job of the new protectionforce is not to defeat an enemy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ non-extremist tolerant politics has space to develop . The task is thus more like policing than warfighting although it involves the use of military forces . Techniques like safe havens or humanitarian corridors are ways of protecting civilians and also increasing the international presence on the ground so as to influence political outcomes . <p> In practice , peacekeeping has not lived up to this description . Partly this is due to lack of resources . Not nearly enough has been invested in peacekeeping and in providing appropriate training and equipment . More importantly , international lives are still privileged over the lives of the civilians they are supposed to protect . OSCE monitors left Kosovo hurriedly when the bombing of Yugoslavia began , leaving behind a terrified population who had believed rightly or wrongly that the orange vans of the OSCE monitors were some protection ; the local OSCE staff left behind were all killed . Likewise , Dutch peacekeepers handed over the 8000 men and boys of Srebrenica to Serb forces in July 1995 and they were all massacred . In Rwanda , UN forces were withdrawn just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impassioned plea of the Canadian UN Commander , General Dallaire , to establish safe havens . There are , of course , also moments of heroism , like the Ukranian peacekeepers in Zepa or the British in Goradze , or the UN staff in East Timor who refused to evacuate their headquarters unless the people who had sought refuge there were also saved . But , as yet , these moments are insufficient to be seen to justify the commitment in resources and will that would be necessary for a serious and sustained use of peacekeeping . <p> Peace-keeping/peace enforcement is associated with states that could be described as post-modern ( Cooper ) or globalising ( Clarke ) . These are states that have come to terms with the erosion of their autonomy ( their ability to retain control over what happens in their territory ) , in the context of growing interconnectedness . They have thus adopted a deliberate strategy of multilateralism , of trying to influence the formation of global rules and participating actively in the enforcement of those rules . The British Prime Minister Tony Blair attempted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Doctrine of the International Community ' during the Kosovo war . ' We are all internationalists now whether we like it or not ' he told an audience in Chicago . ' We can not refuse to participate in global markets if we want to prosper . We can not ignore new political ideas in other countries if we want to innovate . We can not turn our backs on conflicts and the violation of human rights in other countries if we still want to be secure ' ( Blair 1999 ) . <p> The states that fit this category include most European states , Canada , South Africa , Japan , as well as a number of others . Of course , most states , including the United States and Russia , engage in this type of peace operation . But it is not viewed as the main contingency for which they prepare . The new globalising states are reorienting their military doctrines along these lines . The wars in the Balkans have had a profound impact in Europe , where concern about Balkan stability and experience in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> During the Cold War period , the main concern was how to prevent a war of global annihilation . Arms control was seen as one of the most important methods of prevention ; it was a way of stabilising the perception of a balance of power . A true balance of power is a war that no side can win . Because armed forces were roughly similar during the Cold War period , it was possible to estimate a surrogate balance of power based on quantitative estimates of military forces , which could be codified in arms control treaties . This surrogate balance of power was seen as a way of preventing perceptions of imbalance , which might have tempted one or other side to start a war . In practice , of course , numbers are irrelevant since any nuclear war is likely to lead to global annihilation but the exercise of measuring a balance of power shored up the notion of an imaginary war that could not be won . <p> The danger of a war of global annihilation has , thankfully , receded since the end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however , is a series of real wars that can not be won . There are no surrogate balances , except perhaps between the neo-modern military forces . The US no longer has what is known in the jargon as a ' peer competitor ' and other types of armed forces are too varied to be compared . What I have tried to argue is that the first three types of armed forces ( the networks , the new American military forces , and the neo-modern military forces ) all engage in real wars with very similar consequences - indiscriminate suffering for civilians ( even though the Americans claim that their greater precision and discriminateness minimises such suffering ) . Nowadays , therefore , the emphasis of those who are concerned about such suffering has to be directly with the ways to control war . Limitations on weapons may be part of that wider goal but have to be viewed from a different perspective than in the Cold War period . <p> Perhaps the most hopeful approach to the contemporary problem of controlling war , nowadays , is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ international humanitarian law ( the ' laws of war ' ) and human rights law . During the 1990s , much greater importance was accorded to humanitarian norms - the notion that the international community has a duty to prevent genocide , violations of humanitarian law ( war crimes ) and massive violations of human rights ( crimes against humanity ) . The idea of overriding state sovereignty in the case of humanitarian crises became much more widely accepted . The establishment of the Yugoslav and Rwanda Tribunals paved the way for the establishment of an International Criminal Court . The Pinochet and Ariel Sharon cases removed the principle of sovereign immunity . <p> Humanitarian law is not , of course , new . Its origins lie in the codification of ' laws of war ' , especially under the auspices of the International Red Cross , in the late nineteenth century . The aim was to limit what we now call ' collateral damage ' or the side effects of war , above all , to prevent the indiscriminate suffering of civilians , and to ensure humane treatment for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ codified rules in Europe , which dated back to the Middle Ages and underlay a notion of ' civilised ' warfare , which was important in order to define the role of the soldier as the legitimate agent of the state , as a hero not a criminal . ( Of course , these rules were not applied outside Europe against ' barbarians ' or the ' rude nations ' ) . <p> Humanitarian law was greatly extended after World War II . The Nuremberg and Tokyo trials marked the first enforcement of war crimes and , indeed , crimes against humanity . The Genocide Convention of 1948 as well as further extension of the Geneva Conventions , and , the newly developing human rights law , all represented further strengthening of humanitarian law , albeit marginalised by the dominant Cold War confrontation . <p> What has changed in the last decades is the change in the nature of warfare , even though some aspects were presaged in the holocaust and the bombing of civilians in the Second World War . As argued above , violations of humanitarian law and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of war , they represent the core of the new warfare . Therefore taking seriously humanitarian law is one way of controlling the new warfare . <p> Click here for the text of the Genocide Convention and here for the text of all the Geneva Conventions . <p> This is the context in which the limitation of armaments should also be understood . Recent efforts to limit or eliminate categories of weapons , like the Land Mines Convention or the protocol to the Biological Weapons Convention , or the efforts to control small arms are not based on the assumption of a balance between states . Rather they are the outcome of pressure by global civil society to uphold humanitarian norms and prevent indiscriminate harm to civilians . The 1996 International Court of Justice decision about nuclear weapons , as well as several recent cases in Scotland , is based on the same line of thinking . <p> Taken seriously , a humanitarian approach would outlaw netforce and would restructure legitimate , i.e. state , military forces from classic war fighting tasks to a new and extended form of protectionforce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ land mines that cause indiscriminate harm . Peace keeping and peace enforcement could be reconceptualised as humanitarian law enforcement , with appropriate equipment and training . <p> Such an approach would be consistent with the transformation of states along the lines of the post-modern or globalising states . It would imply a strengthening of global rules and greater participation in the enforcement of rules . All three of the other types of warfare I have described are based on particularist assumptions about the need to protect particular communities , networks or states , and to privilege their lives over others . There is no reason why growing interconnectedness can not be combined with particularism and fragmentation ; indeed that is the characteristic of the contemporary world . But it is no longer possible to insulate particular communities or states ; even the United States is now vulnerable to transnational networks . If we are to find ways to cope with the uneven impact of globalisation and to deal with the criminal and violent underside of globalisation , then the main task is to construct some form of legitimate set of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ global state ; rather it is about establishing a set of global regimes underpinned by states , international institutions and global civil society . The humanitarian regime would be at the heart of such a set of rules because of the legitimacy that derives from the assumption of human equality . <p> If the legitimacy of modern states derived from their ability to protect borders against external enemies and to uphold the law domestically , then the legitimacy of global governance is likely to be greatly enhanced by a humanitarian regime that takes ultimate responsibility for the protection of individuals and for upholding international law . I am not implying a single world security organisation . Rather I am talking about a collective commitment by states , international organisations and civil society to act when individual states fail to sustain these norms and to do so within a framework of international law . <p> How would this approach have changed the reaction to the events of September 11 ? What happened on September 11 was a crime against humanity . It was interpreted , however , in the US as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repeatedly drawn with Pearl Harbour . Bush talks about a ' war on terrorism ' and has said that ' you are either with us or with the terrorists ' . The approach of casualty-free war had been adopted , using high tech strikes and a proxy , the Northern Alliance , to destroy the state sponsoring terrorism , the Taliban , and to destroy the Al-Qaeda network . ( At the time of writing , some US Special Forces and Marines have been deployed on the ground ) . We do not know how many people have died as a result of the strikes or have fled their homes but it undoubtedly numbers in hundreds if not thousands . The chances of stabilising Afghanistan exist but are reduced by the dominant role played by the Northern Alliance . Most importantly , perhaps , the approach contributes to a political polarisation between the West and the rest , both because of the privileging of American lives and the language in which the war is conducted . While the Taliban has been overthrown and , hopefully , bin Laden may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ victory . As I have argued , the political narrative , in this case of jihad against America , is central to the functioning of the network . Casualty-free war confirms the political narrative and sets up exactly the kind of war envisaged by the Al-Qaeda network . <p> A humanitarian approach would have defined September 11 as a crime against humanity . It would have sought United Nations authorisation for any action and it would have adopted tactics aimed at increasing trust and confidence on the ground , for example through the establishment of safe havens in the North as well humanitarian corridors . It would have established an International Court to try terrorists . It would have adopted some of the means already adopted to put pressure on terrorist networks through squeezing financial assets , for example , as well as efforts to catch the criminals . Such an approach would also have to eschew double standards . Catching Mladic and Karadic , the perpetrators of the Srebrenica massacre , is just as important as catching bin Laden .

What this involves is , no doubt , being discussed in other sessions of this symposium . <p> I am aware that all this sounds impossibly utopian . Unfortunately , the humanitarian approach may be seen in retrospect as a brief expression of the interregnum between the end of the Cold War and September 11 , 2001 . We are , I fear , on the brink of a global new war , something like the wars in the Balkans or the Israel-Palestine war , on a global scale with no outsiders to constrain its course . Sooner or later , the impossibility of winning such a war must become evident and that is why we need to keep the humanitarian approach alive .

@@2741382 <p> A year after the events of September 11 , 2001 , we seem to be suffering a widening gulf between the broad American perception of politics in the Middle East and the political perceptions of most political forces and ordinary individuals in the Middle East . A frequent popular American tendency to view the Middle East in rather simplistic , essentialist , static and one-dimensional terms contrasts sharply with political perceptions from within the region , which suggest rather that the region is defined by a complex and dynamic web of multiple issues in a variety of sectors . Among the most pressing issues that challenge and sometimes plague the peoples of the Middle East--especially the Arab World that I know best and of which I speak predominantly here--are those of internal governance systems , economic conditions and trends , the tension between religiosity and secularism , the Arab-Israeli conflict and its repercussions , and the complex , often uneasy , relationships among citizens ' ethnic , tribal , and other communal identities and their state identity . Beyond the borders of the states , the Mideast region suffers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and broadly imprecise , often contradictory , attitudes towards economic and political linkages at the regional and global levels . Brisk social change , environmental stress , and population-resource imbalances challenge most societies in the area , which also suffer the impact of exaggerated militarism and its consequent economic drain . Civil societies throughout the area are at very different stages of development , as is witnessed perhaps most clearly in the very broad range of conditions and opportunities that define women and youth throughout the area . <p> Other important issues challenge the peoples and states of the Middle East , whose worldviews and attitudes toward political developments are the result of the many levels of interaction and tension among these important issues . Rather than being static and one-dimensional , the political perceptions , beliefs , and conduct of Middle Easterners are , in fact , complex , multi-tiered , nuanced , constantly evolving , and both reflective of indigenous values and reactive to external impulses . The troubling fact seems to be that on most of these core issues mentioned above , and for most of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ negative and worrying . While the general political , economic and social order of the region remains stable , as it has been for decades , without significant danger of either military coups or popular revolutions , this relative stability hides an underlying frustration and perhaps even humiliation that defines the lives of many Middle Easterners , especially Arabs , Turks , and Iranians . <p> As this broad-brush description of the Middle East is juxtaposed against the consequences of the events of September 11 , two questions suggest themselves : 1 . what is the linkage , if any , between the above factors and trends and the phenomenon of terror , especially Bin Laden-type Islamist terror against the USA ? 2 . What has happened since September 11 to address the core issues of concern to the majority of Arabs , and thus to indicate if the underlying frustrations and humiliations that feed terror are increasing or decreasing ? <p> My impression is that the answer to both questions is negative , and thus very troubling . On the first issue , it is clear that the difficult @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fertile breeding ground of mass discontent , from which emerge small groups of militants and a handful of terrorists like those who attacked the USA on September 11 . The litany of sectoral deficiencies and negative trends--existential issues to many families--generates a pool of mass anger that will not remain acquiescent to the status quo ; rather , as we have witnessed in the last two decades , it will generate mass movements of political protest and challenge at one level ( Islamism ) , a lower level of criminality and degradation of public order ( corruption , crime ) , and small pockets of violent confrontation and terror , directed within the region or at Western targets . <p> On the second issue , it appears that since September 11 , in most Arab countries with few exceptions , most of the troubling conditions and trends mentioned above have remained the same or worsened , and new stresses and tensions have been superimposed onto the region as a consequence of indigenous and Western reactions to terror , in the form of the American-defined and -led " war against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their human rights and political participation conditions ; greater state control of their citizens , and more repression in some cases , are widely seen by Arab citizens as their states ' preferred means of participating in the war against terrorism , given most Arab states ' very high reliance on American military and/or economic assistance . This has tended to heighten anti-American sentiments at popular levels and within political elites , and has also increased local tensions between Arab citizens and state authorities . Arabs widely see this trend as reflecting rising neo-colonial forces and values that threaten to transform American global economic dominance or even hegemony into overt political and military hegemony . The pressure from Washington for forced regime change in Iraq after mid-2002 , the rapid expansion of permanent American military bases in the Middle East and Central Asia , and the possibility of a long-term American military-political presence in Iraq are all widely seen by Arabs as signs of a novel American imperial adventure . <p> These and other American policies are fuelling a wider , deeper , and more virulent and violent form of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world , expressed occasionally in the form of assassinations of American officials , troops , or civilians in the Middle East . The important point to keep in mind is that the rising anti-Americanism is driven almost exclusively by cumulative frustration and anger with the substance and style of American foreign policy in the area , and not by any imagined opposition to basic American values of freedom , democracy , equality and tolerance . The list of specific complaints about the manner and substance of American foreign policy is long , and seems to be expanding parallel with the faster projection of American power into the Arab-Asian region . Among the most common accusations that are made against the USA are that it applies a grievous double standard in implementing UN resolutions in , for example , Iraq , Palestine , Syria , Cyprus , Western Sahara , and other contested lands ; it uses countries when it needs them and then precipitously abandons them to their own fates ; it makes lavish promises when it needs to build a coalition for war , then tends to forget @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it only musters a global armada against terror when Americans are traumatized , but not when others around the world die in much larger numbers from the same evil ; it happily supports and uses dictatorial regimes while routinely preaching the value of democracy ; it maintains a flagrantly imbalanced , pro-Israeli tilt in the Arab-Israeli conflict while also insisting on remaining the sole mediator ; it dictates arrogantly to the world , making short-term American political goals the litmus test of whether other countries will be supported or left to languish ; it uses the UN selectively and expediently , and ignores it when that proves more useful to it ; and it seeks to define global norms through its own narrow values and ideologies , including on such important issues as global environmental protection standards , criminal prosecution , trade , and others . <p> Most people in the Arab-Asian region would probably say that they feel that the United States ' policies since September 11 have aggravated all of these long-standing policy complaints , and given billions of people new reasons to criticize the USA and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the ordinary Arab citizen , it seems to me , the view is that the events and aftermath of September 11 did not so much change the world as they magnified , expanded and exacerbated the basic political , economic and strategic forces that have long defined relations between the USA and the Middle East . Those historical forces and political traditions are seen by the average Arab as largely to blame for the frustrating and humiliating dilemma that defines the lives of most people in this region today--a dilemma comprising the twin failures of ordinary Arabs to achieve satisfactory security or identity . Most Arabs still seek the path to real , long-term economic and political security , and the means to express their own political and religious identities freely and openly . <p> One of the areas where the diversity and dynamism of the Middle East is most visible is in the identities of its peoples . The lack of opportunity to engage in free and fair political competition has resulted in the current situation , in which the absence of credible political ideologies has pushed people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , religion , monarchy , official state ideologies , pan-Arabism , and regional identities , with smaller numbers finding their identity in the currents and values of globalization , human rights and democracy , others seeking emigration and the adoption of new , non-Middle Eastern identities , and some opting for war and perpetual conflict . <p> The mass disappointment , frustration and fear that plague so many people in the Arab World continue to foment an environment that is conducive to extremism and terror . While only a handful of Arabs have engaged in terror , growing numbers of citizens seem increasingly resigned to enduring a world defined simultaneously by neo-colonial American military adventures , a frozen Arab political status quo , and increasing incidents of terror against American targets . The continued simultaneous stresses on the average Arab man and woman--political economic , social , environmental , military--portend a volatile region that may become even more politically convoluted in the short run , due to the worsening legacy of political violence that now unites the United States , many Arabs , Israel , and perhaps soon Turkey and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the perceptions of most Arabs , was a point of acceleration along a known road , rather than a fundamental shift towards a new direction of madness . 
@@2741383 <h> Contemporary Conflicts <p> Among the multiple critiques of International Relations theory , its limited relevance for understanding the Third World 's place in global affairs has gained increasing attention during the past decade.2 First , the end of the Cold War revealed a more complex world stage with a plurality of actors , problems and interests that had little to do with traditional interstate power relations . September 11 drove home like a sledgehammer the point that the world is about far more than the high politics of Western nations . Today , IR theory 's poor ability to describe and explain , much less predict , the behavior of states in the global South is recognized as one of its primary shortcomings . This in part accounts for the tepid reception that this body of theory has received within countries not counted among the great powers . Both academic and policy-making circles in the developing and less developed world are skeptical about a theoretical tradition whose claims to universalism not only ignore them , but also act to reify a global order within which they are destined to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breach between contemporary IR theorizing and the multifarious problems besetting peripheral states and societies . Until very recently , the violence and social conflicts found in nearly every corner of the Andes were not even on IR 's radar screen . The 40-year plus armed conflict in Colombia , the violent opposition to Hugo Chavez 's populism , massive social protests in Bolivia and Peru , and Ecuador 's persistent political and social instability have all been branded domestic issues , and thus not within the purview of systemic IR thinking . Worldwide transformations that have blurred the internal-external dichotomy , however , have prompted some to recognize what has long been common knowledge in the region : local conflicts and problems are completely enmeshed with complex global economic , social and political processes . Colombia 's conflict is a case in point . Global markets for illicit drugs , links between Colombian armed actors and international criminal organizations , regional externalities of Colombian violence , the massive level of migration to the North , the explosion of the global third sector 's presence in Colombia , increasing U.S. military @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the deteriorating Colombian situation all illustrate the international face of this crisis . <p> What light might IR theory shed on a conflict that is estimated to result in 3,500 deaths a year , two thirds of which are civilian , that is responsible for 2.7 million displaced people and another 1 million plus international refugees , whose political economy is such that an average of seven kidnappings occur daily , and that has the country awash in numbing levels of violence and human rights abuses ? 4 IR theory is in the business of explaining and predicting violent conflict , as well as the behavior of the world 's member states in relation to conflict and stability . Although critical and second-order theories of international relations have fundamentally different concerns5 , substantive theorizing must address what Michael Mann calls IR 's " most important issue of all : the question of war and peace . " 6 Indeed , realist and liberal theories within the classical paradigm , which share a similar ontology , assumptions and premises , purport to do just that . Given that Kal Holsti 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conflicts between 1945 and 1995 took place in either the traditional or the new Third World , a viable theoretical framework of world politics must be able to integrate the global periphery.7 <p> In this short essay I will discuss what contemporary IR scholarship may or may not offer in its treatment of the Andean Region , and of the armed conflict in Colombia in particular . My commentary will be limited to three issues familiar to the developing world , as seen through the lens of Colombia 's current crisis : the correlation of state weakness with violence and instability , the post-territorial nature of security threats , and the North-South power disparity . I will conclude with some observations on what this may tell us about the adequacy of the theories themselves . <h> State Weakness <p> The sovereign state that lies at the heart of the Westphalian model is the building block of mainstream IR theory . Most theorizing about international politics characterizes the state in terms of power , understood as the capability of achieving national interests related to external security and welfare . Realist and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all concerned with explaining conflictual and cooperative relations among territorially distinct political units , even while their causal , or constitutive , arguments are quite different . Although Kenneth Waltz was taken to task for blithely claiming that states under anarchy were always " like units " with similar functions , preferences and behavioral patterns , much of international relations scholarship persists in a top-down , juridical view of statehood largely abstracted from internal features.8 <p> But international legal sovereignty may be the most that the advanced industrialized states have in common with states on the global periphery such as Colombia . First of all , Colombia 's priority is internal security , not its power position relative to other states . Threats to the state originate within Colombian territory , not in neighboring countries . In spite of some longstanding border tensions and historical rivalries within the Andean Region , Colombia and its neighbors tend to be more concerned with the strength of domestic social movements and armed actors than they are with the international balance of power . Indeed , even in the absence of a regional balancer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or multilateral governance structures , inter-state wars in the region during the 20th century have been extremely rare . This no-war zone , or negative peace according to Arie Kacowicz , appears to be best explained by a shared normative commitment to maintaining a society of states and to peaceful conflict resolution , contradicting both material and systemic explanations of interstate behavior.9 <p> State strength in much of the developing world is not measured in terms of military capability to defend or project itself externally , but rather according to the empirical attributes of statehood : the institutional provision of security , justice and basic services ; territorial consolidation and control over population groups ; sufficient coercive power to impose order and to repel challenges to state authority ; and some level of agreement on national identity and social purpose.10 States in the Andean Region all receive low marks for the very features that mainstream IR theory accepts as unproblematic , and immaterial . Although Colombia is in no immediate danger of collapse , most indications point to a state that has become progressively weaker : the basic functions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government control is non-existent in many jurisdictions , social cohesion is poor , and the fundamental rules of social order and authority are violently contested.11 Most importantly , the Colombian state fails the basic Weberian test of maintaining its monopoly over the legitimate use of force and providing security for its citizens.12 <p> Internal state weakness , ranging from impairment to outright collapse , is the common denominator of post-Cold War global violence and insecurity.13 It is also the permissive condition of Colombia 's security emergency . Reduced state capacity underlies the more proximate causes of the violent competition with and among contending subnational groups , namely the FARC , ELN , paramilitaries , and narcotrafficking organizations . Recent efforts by the Alvaro Uribe administration to build up Colombia 's military suggest movement toward state strengthening , although effective consolidation must go far beyond this one component of stateness . It remains to be seen whether in the long run Colombia 's bloody conflict becomes a force for state creation in the Tillian tradition , 14 or on the contrary a structure that has ritualized violent discord as a normal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capacity and competence has taken its toll on what is perhaps a state 's most valuable asset--legitimacy . The Colombian state 's mediocre performance and problem-solving record degrades central authority , reducing public compliance and policy options , and leading to a further deterioration in internal order as para-institutional forms of security and justice emerge . This dynamic has been exacerbated by new mechanisms of global governance and the proliferation of global actors within domestic jurisdictions increasingly perceived as legitimate alternatives to sovereign state authority . What Jessica Matthews describes as a " power shift " away from the state--up , down , and sideways--to suprastate , substate , and nonstate actors as part of the emergent world order may also involve a relocation of authority.15 This is particularly apparent in the post-colonial and developing world where the state is less equipped to respond to internal challengers , and sovereignty 's norm of exclusivity is more readily transgressed . In Colombia , alternative political communities such as transnational NGO 's , church and humanitarian associations , and global organizations , as well as insurgent and paramilitary groups , are increasingly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <h> Global Security Dynamics <p> At the same time that Colombia 's security crisis is in great measure attributable to the empirical weakness of the state , it also highlights another dimension of the emerging global order : the complex interplay between domestic and international security domains . The globalization of security puts into sharp relief the growing discontinuity between fixed , territorial states and the borderless processes that now prevail in world politics . While Realists would point out that current events in North Korea and Iraq are eloquent reminders of the applicability of a traditional national security model in which state-on-state military threats predominate , concerns in Colombia reflect a somewhat different security paradigm . <p> First of all , insecurity in Colombia is experienced by multiple actors , including the state , the society at large , and particular subnational groups . Security values , in turn , vary according to the referent : national security interests , both military and nonmilitary , exist alongside societal and individual security concerns . Colombian society not only seeks security against attacks , massacres , torture , kidnapping , displacement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of institutional guarantees related to democracy and the rule of law , and access to basic services such as education , employment and health care . Many of the internal risks that Colombia confronts are also enmeshed with regional , hemispheric and global security dynamics that are dominated by state and non-state actors . <p> While Colombia is typically viewed as being the in eye of the regional storm , the Colombian crisis is itself entangled with transregional and global security processes , including drug trafficking , the arms trade , criminal and terrorist networks , and U.S. security policies.16 The remarkable growth in the strength of Colombia 's most destabilizing illegal groups during the 1990s , for instance , is directly attributed to their ability to generate revenue from activities related to the global market for illegal drugs.17 Both the FARC and the paramilitaries capture rents from the cultivation , production and trade of cocaine and heroin , which finances their organizations , keeps them well stocked with arms also traded on regional and worldwide black markets , and sustains a pernicious conflict . These transactions occur within complex @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Andean region , which in turn are involved in global financial , crime , and even terrorist networks.18 Seen from this perspective , Colombia 's war is not so internal after all : it actively involves dense transborder networks composed of an array of global actors.19 Such a post-sovereign security setting underscores the necessity for mainstream IR theorizing to go beyond its state-centered vision of world politics and to develop conceptual tools better equipped to deal with global realities . <h> Power and Authority on the Periphery <p> IR theory 's notion of formal anarchy coexists uneasily with relations of inequality and domination that pervade world order . While most states in the South would tell you that the exclusive authority with which the institution of sovereignty endows them is not quite equal to that of their more powerful northern associates , neorealism and neoliberalism insist that the evident discrepancies among states are mere power differentials within a decentralized international system that lacks a central political authority . Thus hegemony and asymmetrical interdependence as such do not contradict the fundamental IR distinction between anarchy and hierarchy . <p> Some dominant-subordinate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be about more than material differences , however . The immense disparity in economic , political and military power has permitted Washington to impose its will in Colombia on a wide range of issues similar to a coercive hegemonic project . Nevertheless , Colombian observance of American preferences in its foreign and internal security policy is not exclusively related to overt threats or quid pro quos . The rules of what Alexander Wendt and Daniel Friedheim call " informal empire " are such that inequality can also be characterized as a de facto authority structure.20 Authority implies that the U.S. exercises a form of social control over Colombia , and that in turn Colombian compliance can not always be explained by fear of retribution or self-interest , but rather suggests some acceptance , no matter how rudimentary , of the legitimacy of U.S. power.21 Ongoing practices that become embedded in institutional structures can create shared behavioral expectations and intersubjective understandings reflected in identities and preferences . Colombia 's anti-drug posture , for example , that was in great measure shaped by Washington-s militarized war on drugs and aggressive extradition policy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prohibitionist discourse of the United States , and become an active agent in reproducing its own identity and interests vis-+ -vis the illegality and danger of drugs.23 <p> It would be an exaggeration , however , to conclude that Colombia 's behavior on its shared agenda with the U.S. is completely consensual : the underlying power configuration is a constant reminder that Washington calls the shots . The U.S. reconstruction of Colombia 's internal conflict into part of its war on global terror , with great uncertainty within the country about its implications for a negotiated settlement , is illustrative . U.S. preponderance can also lead to " increased incentives for unilateralism and bilateral diplomacy , " at times directly against Colombian interests.24 Recent arm-twisting to grant immunity to American citizens and military in Colombia from prosecution for human rights violations under the International Criminal Court is a case in point . Still , material inequalities can obscure how third-dimensional power also operates in the informal authority relations between the United States and Colombia . <h> Conclusion <p> The Colombian situation suggests various themes which theories of world politics would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been largely silent on the issues of state-making and state-breaking that reside at the heart of the Third World security problematic . In neglecting domestic contexts more broadly speaking , this body of theory is inadequate for explaining the relationship between violent " internal " conflicts and global volatility at the start of the 21st century . These theories also have a blind spot when it comes to non-state actors in world politics . In overemphasizing states , realist theories in particular are hard pressed to adequately account for the countless sources of vulnerability of states and societies alike . Security threats , from terrorism to drug trafficking to AIDS , defy theoretical assumptions about great power politics and the state 's pride of place in world order . Similarly , non-territorial global processes such as Colombia 's security dynamics are not well conceptualized by conventional IR levels of analysis that spatially organize international phenomena according to a hierarchy of locations.25 Colombia 's experience with sovereignty also calls into question the logic of anarchy in realist and liberal IR theorizing . Seen from a peripheral point of view , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rhetorical device that camouflages deep and persistent material and social inequalities in the international system . We thus arrive at the conundrum of a " stable " world order , in IR terms defined by the absence of war among the world 's strongest states , wracked by violent conflict and immeasurable human suffering in peripheral regions . Perhaps most importantly , today 's global security landscape should prompt us to rethink theories that by and large bracket the non-Western , developing domains and suppress their narratives . <p> The heterogeneity of the IR discipline cautions us against jettisoning the entire canon as flawed when it comes to the Third World , however . Constructivists ' incorporation of a social dimension into an analysis of state identities and interests is a promising research agenda for analyzing non-material aspects of North-South relations . Institutionalism theory has also contributed to our understanding of the role of global institutions and norms in conflict resolution and cooperation in the Third World , and may offer insight into seemingly intractable conflicts such as Colombia 's . Paradoxically , certain realist precepts also have utility for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of global economic , political and military power has an enormous impact on center and peripheral states alike . As we have seen , the inequality in U.S.-Colombian relations poses a serious challenge to multilateralism and mechanisms of global governance . In spite of the ongoing reconfiguration of the state in response to global transformations , the sovereign state has proved to be highly adaptive and resilient . Colombia 's internal weakness , for example , is to be contrasted with the state 's increasingly successful political and diplomatic agenda within the international community , even in the face of increasing global constraints . The complexities of Colombian security dynamics , which vividly illustrate a non-realist security landscape , nevertheless require that public policies prioritize , delineate and specify threats and responses largely in conventional , military terms . And finally , Colombia 's efforts to recuperate state strength , or complete its unfinished state-making process , as the case may be , suggest that state power remains pivotal to internal , and thus global , order . <p> Rather than dismissing IR theory outright for its shortcomings in explaining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be better advised to look toward peripheral regions for what they can contribute to testing , revising , and advancing our theories of international politics . Perhaps the explosion of war-torn societies in the Third World and the implications this has for global order will inspire critical analysis of where the theories fail and what they have that is germane to analysis of international relations in the South . Just as there is no single theoretical orthodoxy in IR , neither is the Third World a like unit . With any luck , the diversity of these experiences will lead to new theorizing about world politics . <h> Endnotes <p> 1 I would like to thank Arlene Tickner for her helpful comments on this article . <p> 2 For an introduction to this line of analysis , see Stephanie Neuman , ed. , International Relations Theory and the Third World ( New York : St. Martin 's Press , 1998 ) . <p> 3 On how Latin American scholarship has incorporated Anglo-American IR thought , see Arlene Tickner , " Hearing Latin American Voices in International Studies " , International @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . <p> 4 While the number of conflict related deaths is high , the overall figures on violence in Colombia are nothing short of alarming .
