The Customs Service and the trade community are totally dependent on automation , and US trade volume is increasing at such a rapid pace that Customs can only process import entries , and the raft of other documents used daily by importers and exporters , if the automated system works successfully . The ACS 's architecture is outdated , and the system is operating on average at 90 to 95 per cent capacity . US @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be maximized in March , 1999 , and in the last week of February , the workload became so great that entry filings began to back up . <p> The Customs Service is addressing this crisis in terms of both short-term and long-term solutions . A new computer has been installed in order to speed processing over the coming six months . In the longer term , the only solution is to replace the outdated ACS with a modern system currently under development , known as the Automated Commercial Environment ( ACE ) . The ACE projects development costs of over one billion dollars , and funding remains the issue . The government wants to pay for ACE via a user fee , and importers remain opposed to any new taxes or fees . And while this standoff continues , the US Customs Service , importers and customs brokers anticipate further brownouts or even a lengthy blackout . <p> The Customs Service is asking the international trade community for assistance in implementing short- term fixes , and the community is responding : importers and customs brokers have been asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early in the morning , late at night or on weekends . <p> The funding situation regarding ACE has been complicated by a program , known as International Trade Data Services ( ITDS ) , proposed by the Treasury Department . ITDS would be an electronic program for trade documentation , and act as a single gateway that would receive information and transmit this to the appropriate agency or agencies involved in processing trade documentation . The ITDS program will be discussed at the NCBFAA conference . <p> As far as the NCBFAA is concerned , importers , exporters , brokers , forwarders and carriers must work together to convince the government to fund Customs ' automation .

Members who have additional questions may send them to the CSCB at cscb@cscb.ca . <p> CSCB : Our interpretation of this notice is that importers must deduct certain amounts when they are included in the price paid or payable in order to arrive at the correct value for duty of imported goods . CBSA : Correct . Importers must comply with the legislative requirement to adjust identified in paragraph 48(5) ( b ) . As indicated in Customs Notice N-585 , this obligation must be satisfied when an importer has knowledge of the actual amount a charge for a deduction . N-585 refers the reader to D13-3-3 , which provides additional information on the identification of " actual transportation costs " . <p> CSCB : However , this deduction can not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Is this interpretation correct ? CBSA : No . N-585 does not state that the deduction can not be taken . An importer is obliged to make a deduction if the actual amount is known at time of customs accounting . If documentation to support a deduction is not available at time of customs accounting an importer can still make the deduction in their VFD calculation , but may be required to self-correct after importation if the deduction can not be substantiated . <p> CSCB : In many cases , exporters indicate an amount in field 23(i) of the Canada Customs Invoice . ( Field 23(i) is reserved for transportation charges , expenses and insurance from the place of direct shipment to Canada , included in the invoice total ) . Does this mean that importers and brokers must determine whether or not the amount shown in field 23(i) can be validated before it can be deducted ? CBSA : No . An importer is not obliged to obtain documentation in support of a VFD calculation prior to customs accounting . <p> CSCB : With G7 1-step ; PARS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advance of the arrival of the goods - this type of verification is virtually impossible . Was this your intention ? CBSA : The intent of N-585 is to communicate that an importer is obliged to make deductions identified in paragraph 48(5) ( b ) from the price of goods only when the importer knows that the amount of the charge included in the price is the actual charge for that item . <p> CBSA : As well , if there is an invoice on hand that indicates a certain amount of freight included in the value , and it is now mandatory to take the deduction , is there an obligation to confirm that the amount shown on the invoice is correct ? CBSA : A deduction from the price of goods is only mandatory when an importer knows that the amount of the charge to be deducted is the actual amount of the charge . <p> CSCB : Or will the invoice on hand be enough to constitute reason to believe ? CBSA : Given the response to the question immediately above , if an importer has only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that an amount for freight is included in the selling price and is not confident that the information is correct , the importer is not obliged to make the deduction in their VFD calculation . CSCB : What documents are acceptable in order to support the amount deducted , especially in the case of freight deductions ? CBSA : N-585 refers the reader to D13-3-4 , which identifies documents ( including freight invoices and bills of lading ) acceptable to establish the place from which freight charges included in the price of goods can be deducted . However , any document completed by a party with knowledge of the actual amount of a charge to be deducted from the price of goods could conceivably be used to support a calculation of value for duty . <p> CSCB : Currently , if goods are duty free , importers are not concerned with whether or not deductions are taken . There is no duty payable , and the GST is recovered through input tax credits . By making it mandatory for importers to take deductions , another step has been added to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ field between importers of duty free and dutiable goods , since importers of dutiable goods who have not taken deductions are not obliged to correct , since the corrections would result in a refund of duty . CBSA : All importers are required to comply with the legislative provisions of the Customs Act . If any importer is aware prior to customs accounting of the actual amount of a paragraph 48(5) ( b ) deduction that is included in the price of goods , they are obliged to consider the deduction in their value for duty calculation . The differences in self-correction obligations between dutiable and duty-free goods are not limited to the valuation program , and concerns in this area should be addressed to our Trade Incentives Programs colleagues . <p> CBSA : .... I hope this reply addresses your membership 's concerns to your satisfaction .

CSCB President Carol West attended this meeting as a Customs and Trade stakeholder . <p> The facilitator 's report is available in MSWord 7.0 format via e-mail , from the CSCB national office ( cscb@cscb.ca ) . Please contact us if you would like a copy . <p> Background <p> In March , 1998 the then-Minister of National Revenue , the Honourable Herb Dhaliwal , PC , MP , launched a Fairness Initiative , the purpose of which was to enhance the fairness of the administration of tax , duty and tariff laws . A fairness plan , " Setting a New Standard : A 7-Point Plan for Fairness " was announced on 9 February 1999 . <p> One of the points of this plan specified that clients , as part of the Voluntary Disclosures Program ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past omissions without incurring penalties . The authority regarding the VDP was transferred from the Investigations Branch to the Appeals Branch on 6 April 1999 as a direct response to concerns expressed by the public during earlier consultations . <p> Since further consultations with internal and external stakeholders were necessary , the CCRA invited major income tax/GST/HST and customs/trade client representatives from across the country to a one-day consultation session in Ottawa on 5 November 1999 . <p> The session 's objectives were to : <p> - obtain a consensus from participants regarding the purpose of the VDP - obtain participants ' input about what constitutes a voluntary disclosure - obtain participants ' input about what constitutes a complete disclosure - collect participants ' suggestions for promoting and communicating the program <p> Purpose of the Voluntary Disclosure Program <p> The VDP 's purpose was defined as follows : <p> " The purpose of the Voluntary Disclosures Program is to encourage and facilitate non-compliers to come forward without eroding current compliance . " <p> Customs and Trade Voluntary Disclosure Program <p> The Customs professionals consulted strongly held the view that there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own set of rules that are specific to Customs , and there should be another program that is specific to income tax . While the general purpose of the VDP is the same for both Customs and tax , the application of the programs can not be the same . <p> There is little information specific to Customs and Trade in the 7-point fairness plan , or in other documents provided for consultation . They felt that with the forthcoming changes in the law and the Administrative Monetary Penalty System ( AMPS ) affecting clients , the application of VDP to Customs and Trade was less clear-cut than its application to income tax . As a general rule , they felt that more discussion was needed with the CCRA in order to clarify their clients ' needs . <p> The importance that VDP guidelines be transparent and clear was stressed frequently . This underlined the pervasive perception that there is currently no transparency and too much is left to the discretion of CCRA officers . The Customs and Trade professionals noted that they wanted to see the VDP guidelines embodied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the United States . <p> These participants underlined the importance of aligning the Canadian Customs and Trade VDP with the American voluntary disclosure program , since a large part of imports/exports have to do with trade between Canada and the United States . <p> The proposed VDP was summarized as follows : <p> - For Customs and Trade , a disclosure should be considered voluntary even if an audit has been instigated ; there should be a statute of limitation of four years for the disclosure to be considered complete ; and there should be no penalty whatsoever for what is being disclosed even if there is discrepancy between audited and disclosed figures .

The ANS notice should be sufficient to inform the RailWay company that the shipment has been reviewed and recommended by CFIA .

The majority of these changes to the HS have been broached by the FAO ( Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations ) . <p> Due to the importance of the HS in the collection of trade statistics , the HS 2017 amendments for fish and fishery products are to further enhance the coverage of species and product forms which need to be monitored for food security purposes and for better management of resources . The split by more detailed product forms for crustaceans , molluscs and other invertebrates is motivated by the importance of trade and consumption of these species in the various product forms . The subdivisions enable a better correspondence between the HS and the United Nations Central Product Classification ( CPC ) .
