When I was a first-year MSW student , I took my first Policy class . I wanted to be a therapist . After a week , I ( foolishly ) asked my professor , " Why do we need any of this ? " He looked pained and proceeded to tell me that Policy was " the rules , " and that those rules would determine what services I could provide , to whom , and what funding and access there would be for my " therapy . " I did n't " get it " at the time . <p> Now I teach research . One evening , one of my very bright MSW students looked frustrated . I asked if there was something she did n't understand .

" I made the same pained expression my Policy teacher had 30 years earlier . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was serious and did n't mean to induce cardiac arrest . In fact , she was n't asking a question ; she was honestly stating her feelings . ( We teach social work students that it ' good to do that . ) <p> And so , I was sure I had failed her-not her grade , but her education . Had n't I given the " why you need research " lecture ? Had n't we discussed fascinating research designs and crucial outcome studies ? Had n't we discussed research ethics , literature reviews , critical analyses , statistical testing , outcomes evaluation ? We had ... and yet the question remained . <p> I came to realize she did n't doubt the importance of research ... she doubted the relevance of research for her .

How can you be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ domestic violence shelter worker , a youth counselor , or any direct service worker without research skills ? It would be nice to think we taught you everything you needed to know in the social work program . Too bad . We did n't . When I was a therapist , I was seeing a client for marital counseling . I had learned a lot about family systems . One day my client told me his father had sexually abused him as a child . Funny , my program never taught me about sexual abuse of boys by their fathers . What should I do ? I needed the developmental impact of this kind of sexual abuse . What kinds of treatments were likely to be effective ? How much was suicide a risk ? Should I explore and reflect past feelings or teach avoidance and compartmentalization ? I was glad to know how to use a library and the research literature . Other people ' research made my work a lot less anxiety provoking . <p> Good social workers care about what happens to their clients . Yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NASW Code of Ethics , but good social workers do n't want to be effective because of the NASW Code of Ethics . They want to be effective because they CARE .

But it does . You want money to continue your program . You want money to expand services . You want money for new services . You can get it , but you have to know how ( and who ) to ask .

Prove that the money we already gave you was put to good use . You prove it with program evaluation , a.k.a. research . <p> Sometimes people say strange and hurtful things in the name of " truth . " Sometimes people will say them because they want to stop what you are doing or prevent you from continuing what you are doing . Things like , " Most people on welfare cheat the system , " or " 98% of men pay their child support . " Sometimes they come up with research to prove it . You need to know enough about research to show them ( or politicians/funders/your community ) the error of their way , or their method of obtaining data , or their statistical procedures , or their ( false ) conclusions .

@@100125394 @4325394/ <h> To Report or Not To Report : That Is the Ethical Dilemma <p> Gretchen is a social worker who discovers during counseling that her client , Carly , was sexually abused by her father . Now if Carly was a minor , Gretchen would know that she would have a legal obligation to report this abuse to child protective services . Carly , however , is 24 years old , and the laws of her state do not specifically require social workers to report past abuse if the survivor is now an adult . In this case , Gretchen wishes she could report the abuse , as she personally believes that Carly 's father should be held to account for his heinous actions . Gretchen faces an ethical dilemma , however , because Carly disclosed in strict confidence that she was abused and does not want Gretchen to tell anyone else , least of all the police or child protection authorities . <p> - - - If you were Gretchen 's supervisor , what guidance would you give her ? What considerations should she take into account when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the laws in Gretchen 's state do not require her to report the abuse , Gretchen looks to the NASW Code of Ethics for guidance . Standard 1.07 says Gretchen should respect the privacy of her client and not disclose information to outsiders unless there is a particular exception . These exceptions include consent of the client , clear and immediate danger , and otherwise required by law . <p> - - - Although Carly initially states she does n't want the abuse reported , her stated wishes are not necessarily fully informed . Gretchen may , therefore , provide Carly with information and other support , so Carly can consider her options more fully . For instance , she may not be familiar with what happens during an abuse investigation , fearing that a report to the police will lead to immediate and broad publication of her case . She may not know of legal and procedural protections afforded to survivors of sex-related crimes . Assume , however , that even with such information and support , Carly still resists reporting her father . As Standard 1.02 suggests , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and should avoid imposing their own beliefs on clients . <p> - - - As noted above , the Code of Ethics does not authorize Gretchen to release confidential information for safety concerns unless there is a risk of serious , imminent harm . Carly says that her father does not live with or have immediate access to other minors , so Gretchen can not say there is risk of serious , imminent harm . Because the Code of Ethics does not explicitly cover Gretchen 's concerns in this case , Gretchen considers the following ethical principles : beneficence ( doing good ) , nonmaleficence ( avoiding doing harm ) , justice , and respect . In terms of beneficence , Gretchen thinks that reporting the abuse will be for the greater good of society because it will help protect other minors from being abused by Carly 's father . From Carly 's perspective , however , reporting the abuse may be experienced as harm : she is not emotionally ready to confront her father about the abuse , she fears his reactions , and she does not believe the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in terms of nonmaleficence , Gretchen realizes that reporting the abuse may have a negative impact on her social work relationship with Carly . Carly may feel betrayed by Gretchen and therefore terminate services . From a justice perspective , Gretchen might argue that reporting the abuse is a method of bringing Carly 's father to justice , and that silence or inaction is tantamount to condoning his abuse . Alternatively , Gretchen might consider justice as prioritizing Carly 's emotional and physical safety . Even if reporting the abuse may help protect other children , should Gretchen have the right to impose certain risks on Carly ? Finally , respect comes back to the notions of honoring Carly 's rights to privacy and self-determination . <p> - - - On balance , given the facts of the case as interpreted by Gretchen , she decides to permit Carly to decide whether or not to report the abuse . This course of action not only respects Carly 's rights to self-determination and privacy , but also affords Gretchen with the opportunity of continuing to work with Carly . Perhaps with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manipulation , - Carly may eventually decide to report her father 's abuse to appropriate authorities . In the meantime , Gretchen is supporting a decision that her client believes is best . <p> - - - Gretchen notes further that had the situation varied in certain aspects , her decisions might be different . If Carly had younger siblings living with her father , for instance , she might need to report the abuse in order to protect the children . If Carly lived in a state that legally required social workers to report past abuse even though the survivor is no longer a minor , she would have more impetus to make the report . And if Gretchen worked in an agency that informed clients that workers had a positive duty to report abuse , regardless of the client 's current age , she would also be more inclined to report the abuse . <p> - - - Gretchen documents her decision , including her rationale and those she consulted to assist with her decision " her clinical supervisor and the agency 's attorney .

Wilshere , LSW <p> - - - When one enters the profession of social work , there are many values to learn . One is that personal opinions get put aside for professional ones . This means for anything a person believes is wrong or inferior , such as having a different color skin , loving a person of the same sex , having a different religion , abortion , or any of many other values and ideas , we are asked to put this aside in order to treat the person with whom we are working . This can be one of the hardest parts of being a social worker . Our own values are set and usually a very important part of ourselves . Social work does not ask one to change or deny those values , but rather encourages one to be aware of them so that they do not interfere with treatment . <p> - - - There is another part to this story . We are called to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ training , or may not agree with this training , which espouses professional values over personal ones . This means that we may have clients , co-workers , peers , and employees who we will supervise , who not only may have strong values that we disagree with , but also may be people who are very vocal about their opinions . As social workers , what is our response to this dilemma ? <p> - - - From the beginning , we must look at ourselves and our speech . As a social worker , am I prepared to take a stand ? If am against abortion and some client wishes to discuss having an abortion , can I , as a professional social worker , deliver sensitive , non-judgmental services ? If someone believes that persons with darker skin are biologically inferior , when they work with a client with dark skin , does that have an impact upon their service to that person ? What if a person believes that being gay is wrong ? What if it is not ourselves we wish to confront about our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maybe a coworker ? What if a co-worker believes in acting upon these values in the form of assaulting someone , such as gays coming out of a bar or persons of different ethnic or racial groups ? <p> - - - In the hallways , how do we respond to comments about racial or ethnic or sexual differences ? Do we say something like , " That is not a very nice thing to say ? " Or do we say nothing ? Is saying nothing a statement of agreement ? What is your response if you overhear a worker trying to persuade a client to have the baby and go through with an adoption instead of having an abortion ? What if you hear one worker degrading another ? <p> - - - When it comes to other relationships , such as supervisor and employee , the role changes a little bit . The supervisor is usually held accountable for setting the tone of the work group . Just holding oneself accountable for being a professional may not be enough . If a person is not held accountable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Legally , there may be issues and set agency policies regarding discipline in this area . Aside from this , if supervisors tolerate racist or other value-laden comments in the work group , are they saying to staff that they are not valued ? Are minority staff comfortable to vocalize complaints in this area ? <p> - - - At this point , consider the following examples and think about what you , as a social worker in the workforce , would do and not do . <p> A worker in a group home described a client with a past history of drug and alcohol abuse . His staff was frustrated with the person . Even though there was no evidence of drugs or alcohol , on the evening in question , the staff believed that the client must have been doing drugs or alcohol , because the person was hanging out on the streets until midnight . The neighborhood is described by staff as dangerous , the people hanging out as non-productive , unemployed , and a bad influence upon the client even though they were the client @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of stereotyping of city persons as lazy and addicts ? If the staff were white and the client and neighborhood black , would this change how it is perceived ? What if the client is white ? <p> A white staff makes fun of a Black male staff who supported the Million Man March on Washington . If you are a co-worker , what is your response ? What if you are a supervisor ? What if you were not a witness to this , but someone came to you with this complaint ? Is it a legitimate complaint ? <p> After walking past a group of policemen , a staff member comments that they wish they had those officers ( several , tall and strong ) when they visit an area that is highly publicized by media as dangerous . It also happens to be occupied largely by minorities . Is this a comment that all minorities are dangerous ? <p> - - - The social worker today has many issues to face . I have deliberately chosen not to answer these questions . I am not sure there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for discussion . One thing I am sure of is that intolerance does not belong in the helping professional 's repertoire of skills . If one 's personal values are more important than the discussion of choices and informed decision making , one might want to think about whether he or she would want those values respected by others . <p> - - - Social workers are expected to embrace a diversity of values and people .

My husband , who I had planned to grow old with and travel , died over a year before I started to school . My children were almost grown and I needed to look out for my financial welfare . I achieved two Associate Degrees ( Office Systems Technology and University Parallel ) ; a Bachelor of Science in Social Work , two Master 's degrees ( Masters of Education in School @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one Education Specialist Degree ( Administration and Leadership ) and eventually my Doctorate of Education in Counseling Psychology . I surprised myself with going as far as I did but have no regret that I did . I worked on both Master 's degrees at the same time traveling for two hours one way four nights a week . I did my doctorate degree at a university in Florida traveling 12 hours one way every six months . I got a School Counseling position when I was 51 yrs . old and presently after 14 yrs . still working on this job ... I hope to work four more years in this position . I worked part-time at a Mental Health Hospital as a psychotherapist for 10 yrs while still working as a school counselor . My husband and I have a private Christian Counseling Service ( Appalachia Christian Counseling ) and hope to work at this for many more years to come . It is never too late to achieve your dream if you want to . I do not want to seem as if I am bragging since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and energy to go to school and to work toward the degrees I mentioned above .

I was exposed to this disease numerous times with unprotected sex since we did not know he was infected with HIV/AIDS until 10 yrs . after he apparently was infected ( another story of a cover-up by government and pharmaceutical companies ) . Somehow God protected me and I did not contract this horrible disease and I feel God had this work for me to do in which I plan to keep going as long as I physically can . I hope to help many people through counseling that are going through difficult times and tragedies in their own lives . God blessed me with a wonderful husband three years after my first husband 's death . My present husband is a minister and felt that his ministry was more in the counseling field ... when we got married @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ university in the area and acquired his degree in Christian Care and Counseling in his older age ( he is a year older than me ) .

The profession of social work began with a focus on helping the poor by those who were not . <p> - - - - The discipline- of social work has- not so long been a qualified profession , only- gaining formal recognition in 1898 in the United States and increasing in world popularity ever since . <p> - - - - Most social workers are familiar with enough of the history to know that- Jane Addams- herself was from a- prosperous- family , as were many of the friendly visitors of the 1800s . <p> - - - - So , as in the case of- many well-to-do social activists , money existed as- a non-issue- in social efforts , - allowing- the issue- to be the issue . <p> - - - - If , from the dawn of the profession , social workers had less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case workers , wealth creation , or money management , it makes sense- that the topic of money remains secondary to the- pressing issues of- poverty , inequality and injustice that we still address- today . <p> - - - - We all learned from the- Strengths Perspective- that to help a system improve , it 's best to focus on the strengths of that system as opposed to its weaknesses . <p> - - - - This is also the preferred perspective of most social workers I know . <p> - - - - But often , our- focus on strengths is primarily- because- a system is limited financially and needs to consider additional resources . Usually those resources- are- more likely to include things like the system 's networks , abilities , - and- unique- characteristics . Generally , if money- is- included as a strength , it 's minimally emphasized and rarely , if ever , maximized- beyond an immediate need or mission , because why would it be- if we 're not accustomed to focusing on money in the first place ? <h> 3 . Service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> - - - - The profession of social work was built on the notion of service. - So fundamental to our mission is service- that we even put it in our- Code of Ethics. - <p> - - - - Think about it . The profession itself has its roots in church activities and- volunteer movements around the world which are all heavily service-based . It makes sense , then , that it remains a strong influencer within the social work profession to this day. - <p> - - - - And although the trend from the corporate and for-profit world is increasingly to embrace the value of a service-oriented- mission , social work remains largely rooted in the NGO and not-for-profit sectors , where money is seen as scarce and resources are considered few . <p> - - - - But service for the social worker has its reward inherent in the act of the service itself . That 's to say , we do it because it 's the right thing to do , not because of a paycheck . <p> - - - - With a- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our goal , is it any wonder , then , that social workers do n't talk more about money ? <h> 4 . Wanting to be wealthy- is seen as anti-social work . <p> - - - - For many social workers , the words " rich , " " money , " and- " wealthy " imply " filthy , " " greedy , " and " capitalistic " - all anti-social work themes. - And yet we can intellectualize that none of these words- are " anti-social work " - in and of themselves . <p> - - - - If social workers believe something is- " filthy , " " greedy , " or " capitalistic , " chances are they are n't going to go for it- - it 's blatantly offensive to the social work creed -- and that 's probably a good reason why more social workers do n't talk about money . <h> 5. - We do n't have many wealthy social workers to look up to . <p> - - - - Although we are aware of- some- social workers- who became- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and we know even fewer wealthy- people who become social workers , so we do n't have a- plethora of- examples of massive wealth by individuals- associated with- the profession . <p> - - - - In his book- Think And Grow Rich , - Napoleon Hill- stressed the importance of having mentors - an individual or group of people to look up to , gain inspiration from , and follow consistently .

" <p> - - - - Although the desired implication may be that money is a secondary component to the act of helping- others , this idea often dissuades social workers from wanting more wealth ; and if the profession that you love so much ever discourages- you from wanting more wealth , why would you ever discuss it ? <h> 7 . We do n't know that we can . <p> - - - - This goes with number six above .

We do n't know how to talk about money . <p> - - - - The Center 's founder , - Reeta Wolfsohn , states that she 's had a hard time selling social workers on the importance of having a financial awareness for themselves and an even harder time getting them to invest in financial training for their- practice . <p> - - - - Robert Kiyosaki , author of- Rich Dad , Poor Dad , teaches that one of the habits of the wealthy and why they have money is because they talk openly and often about it .

Below are listed ten frequently asked questions that may help you narrow your options to a more manageable number . It is recommended that students begin their graduate school search at least one year before they plan to enter a graduate program . <h> 1 . Is the School of Social Work accredited by the Council on Social Work Education ( CSWE ) ? <p> Many agencies will require that you be licensed before or soon after you are employed and in many , if not all , states an accredited degree is a prerequisite to licensure . <p> The Council on Social Work Education ( CSWE ) publishes the Directory of Colleges and Universities with Accredited Social Work Degree Programs . This directory lists accredited baccalaureate and master 's programs , including new programs in candidacy ( pre-accreditation ) status . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Work degree programs that are accredited by CSWE . Nine programs are in candidacy . <p> For further information , check with your advisor , or write or phone CSWE , Accreditation , 1600 Duke Street , Alexandria , VA 22314-3421 ; ( 703 ) 683-8080 ; fax ( 703 ) 683-8099 . CSWE can also be contacted on the Internet at CSWE@access.digex.net. <h> 2 . What concentration areas are offered by the School of Social Work ? <p> Many schools of social work offer two or more concentration areas from which to choose . It is important to be sure that the school of social work you choose offers a concentration area that fits with your professional interests and your career goals . Below are listed several examples of concentrations that might be offered : <p> clinical social work <p> social program administration <p> services in health <p> services in mental health <p> services to the aging and their families <p> services to children , youth , and families <p> planning and management <p> social work practice in industry <p> social work practice in school settings <p> occupational social @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ These are programs that allow you to work on more than one degree simultaneously . Below are listed several dual degree programs offered by some schools of social work : <p> criminal justice and social welfare <p> sociology and social work <p> social work and public health <p> social work and business administration <p> social work and Jewish studies <p> social work and law <p> social work and urban planning <h> 3 . How long does it take ? <p> How many semesters or quarters will it take for me to complete the master 's degree ? The average length of a program for a full-time student is 4 semesters or 6 quarters . The average number of months it takes a full-time student to complete an MSW program is approximately 21 months . Many schools provide advanced standing programs which can be completed in one calendar year . <p> Is there a variety of programs available which lead to the master 's degree ( i.e. , advanced standing , work study , weekend college , part-time ) ? If so , how long does it take to complete each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or schedule ? The Council on Social Work Education requires that the Master of Social Work degree be completed within a four-year period . <h> 4 . What are the criteria for admission ? <p> Is there a minimum GPA requirement ? Does the school admit students conditionally or on probation ? Does the school require an entrance exam ? If so , is a certain score required on the entrance exam ? Two entrance exams commonly used for schools of social work are the Miller Analogies Test ( MAT ) and the Graduate Record Examination ( GRE ) . If an entrance exam is required , you may find it helpful to purchase a study guide for taking the exam . These study guides can be found in most university supply stores and provide hints for successful test-taking , as well as sample tests . <h> 5 . What are my financial aid options ? <p> Talk to the program director or admissions counselor in the school of social work about financial resources that are available through the school . Also talk to the financial aid counselor at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loans , scholarships , work study programs , fellowships , tuition waivers , teaching assistantships , research assistantships , stipends for field placement work , and so on . Ask about the procedure and deadline for applying for each type of financial assistance . <p> Visit the reference section of your local public library or a nearby university library . Ask the librarian for reference books about financial aid , such as Peterson 's Paying Less for College 1994 and Gail Ann Schlachter 's How to Find Out About Financial Aid and Directory of Financial Aids for Women 1993-1995. <h> 6 . Where is the school ? <p> Is the school located in a large city , a small town , a rural area ? Consider what type of area you would like to live in while you are pursuing your master 's degree .

@@100125499 @4325499/ <h> Social Work Licensing--What 's It All About ? <h> Spring 1994 , Vol. 1 , No. 1 <p> Editor 's Note : This article appeared in our very first issue , Spring 1994 . Much of this information may be outdated . <h> Social Work Licensing--What 's It All About ? <p> by Sam Hickman , ACSW , LCSW <p> Professional licensing--that is , a state-required license to practice within a particular profession--is the state 's best effort at protecting its citizens from professional misconduct and malpractice . <p> Licensing differs from certification or registration in that licensing usually has stiffer requirements . It also offers greater status and , in many cases , the only route toward getting direct payment for the provision of certain professional services . Some states require social workers to be licensed , while certification and registration ( whether offered by the state or by a professional organization ) is usually voluntary . Holding a license generally requires the licensee to adhere to a code of ethics or professional conduct . If this code is violated , the license can be revoked or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its main purpose--to protect the public . <p> Your primary concerns are finding out : <p> If the state where you wish to practice requires a license in social work ; <p> If the license is required in your particular practice setting ( see " exemptions " ) ; and <p> How to get a license if you need one . <p> From a professional perspective , licensing provides a " gatekeeper " --a hoop , or series of hoops , through which anyone wishing to practice the profession has to jump . This helps ensure , for example , that only persons trained in psychology become licensed psychologists , only nursing educated folks become licensed nurses , and only those with accredited social work degrees become licensed social workers . <p> But nothing is that simple . <p> States have the inalienable right to define what a profession is , and who may practice it , within their borders . Certainly , there are similarities between states , but I will focus on differences to give you an idea of how they affect you professionally . <h> How to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , etc . <p> State make laws to require licenses . These laws assign the jobs of granting licenses , keeping records , and handling complaints to a particular entity of state government . <p> I do n't know why , but this fact seems to confuse many people . I get so many calls for the licensing board at my NASW Chapter office that when the telephone company offered me an 800 line , I said , " Why do I want an 800 line ... half of my calls are for someone else ! " <p> The fact remains that if you ca n't locate the licensing body via the " state government " pages in your phone book , you best bet at finding them--with the lowest charges for long-distance phone charges--is by calling the NASW Chapter office in your state 's capital city . NASW was involved in achieving most of the licensing laws in the states . It still has a major interest in purveying good information about licensing to social workers . <p> As an alternative , the American Association of State Social Work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Work Laws and Board Regulations : A State Comparison Summary ( $15 plus shipping and handling , AASSWB , 400 S. Ridge Parkway , Suite B , Culpeper , VA 22701 ) . The guide lists fees and additional requirements , as well as listing the licensing bodies of all the states . <h> The LAW and the RULES <p> It is often said that no one would enjoy witnessing the making of sausage or laws . Licensing laws are no exception . Laws come complete with the personality quirks of the legislators who make them . The West Virginia law has an elaborate section describing how to get licensed without an accredited deegree , but the process is more difficult than just going ahead and getting the degree ! <p> LAWS provide the broad framework for licensing--who gets licensed , who pocesses licenses , who gets in trouble for doing what , whether continuing education hours/credits are necessary to keep the license , and so on . <p> RULES are the day-to-day guidelines for the licensing body and the license holder . Rules are more detailed . They tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ test , and so on . They tell you how many continuing education hours you have to have . They tell the licensing body what to do when it receives a complaint . Rules are enabled by laws . Rules ca n't describe or require processes that are not mentioned in the law . Rules are approved through a process of state government , sometimes by the legislature itself . <h> Who gets licensed ? <p> Remember the above about nothing being THAT simple ? Here 's where states demonstrate their individuality . States may require all or some social workers to have a license . <p> And a licensing law may be primarily focused on title protection or practice protection . <h> ALL or SOME <p> State laws may require licensure at a single level or at multiple levels . <p> For example , a single level might mean that only MSWs with over two years of experience who are primarlily clinical social workers have to be licensed . ( Whether other social workers may be licensed is another question entirely . My advice is to get licensed if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from my own state of West Virginia , is that there are separate and distinct levels of license for BSWs , new MSWs , MSWs with over two years of experience , and MSW/Clinical Social Workers with over two years of experience . <p> A title protection law requires anybody whose job title is " Social Worker " to be licensed . It might , for example , allow a BA-level counselor to work as a " discharge planner " but not as a " social worker . " <p> Practice protection means that the specific knowledge base of the profession has been recognized , by law , to be unique . In this case , the law requires all those who claim to engage in the practice of social work , as defined in the law , to hold a social work license . There is usually a disclaimer to the effect that a professional with a related egree who is appropriately trained and duly licensed in that profession to perform some or all of the same methods , treatments , or techniques be allowed to do so without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also appear in the licensing laws of related professions . <p> Most laws are either title protection or practice protection , with practice protection being viewed as the stronger of the two . A few states have laws with their feet in both areas--generally meaning that they are title protection acts which have a modicum of practice protection in them . <h> Exemptions <p> The stronger laws provide for the fewest exemptions . Then there are others ... I kid you not ... which could be paraphrased as , " All social workers must be licensed , unless they work for the federal , state , or municipal government , a hospital , nursing home or other health facility , a non-profit organization , etc. , etc. , etc . " Check with your state 's licensing board to find what exemptions apply there . <h> Each state is different <p> Because each state enacts a law to license or register a given profession , the acronyms vary . Let 's take the case of a regular ol ' MSW with two years of non-clinical , post-master 's work experience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Master Social Worker ( MSW ) ; in Washington , DC , she 's a Licensed Independent Social Worker ( LISW ) ; in New Jersey , a Licensed Social Worker ( LSW ) ; and in West Virginia a Licensed Certified Social Worker ( LCSW ) . In several of these states , she would not be required to have any post-master 's experience . In others , it is mandatory . <p> A BSW license in Indiana requires two years of post-BSW experience . No experience is necessary in Arizona , but BSWs are not required to be licensed at all in 19 states . <h> What to ask <p> If you contact your state 's licensing board , the staff may offer to mail you some general information with the application materials . Once you have had an opportuunity to contact the board and look the information over , these are the questions you need to have answers to : <p> What are the requirements for renewal ? ( continuing education and so on ) <p> How do I document and prove what is needed to renew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the law and/or rules ? <h> The examination <p> Most states require that you take an examination to get a license . This is , of course , after jumping through the hoops of establishing your qualifications . <p> The good news is that all states currently utilize one or more levels of the American Association of State Social Work Boards ( AASSWB ) exams . This makes it easier to prove yourself when crossing borders . <p> The bad news is that you may cross a border into a state that does not license at your level of practice , or which has established qualifications for licensure at your level which you met back home , but not here . The worst news is that your newly adopted state could make you take the same test again , but this does n't happen too often . <p> Be aware that states set their own prices for taking the exam , reviewing an application , granting or renewing a license , and so on . <h> After you get your license <p> Keep copies of everything ! <p> Keep them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ licensing board if you move , change names , retire , decide not to renew your license , leave the frfield of social work for a time , or sneeze ( just kidding ) . <h> In summary <p> Start early ! Some states let you take the exam while you 're still in school . <p> Find out what you need to know and go and do it . <p> Take responsibility for yourself .

@@100125502 @4325502/ <h> Ethics in Private Practice <h> Open for Business Sign <p> by Allan Barsky <p> A number of students entering the field of social work express interest in pursuing private practice . Perhaps , these students enjoy the thought of independent practice " being one 's own boss , being able to set one 's own policies and expectations , being accountable to nobody but oneself , and perhaps being able to earn more than one might expect in an agency-based position . There may also be tax advantages to private practice , including the ability to write off expenses that one can not write off regarding employment income . So , given the allure of private practice , what does the NASW Code of Ethics ( 2008 ) say about private practice , and what are the main ethical concerns ? <p> - - - The NASW Code of Ethics does not mention private practice , per se ... it does not specifically condone or support private practice , and it does not reject or warn against private practice . It does , however , include a number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , abandonment of clients ( s.1.16(b) ) , supervision and consultation ( s. 3.01 ) , and fees ( 1.13(a) ) . <p> - - - In most jurisdictions , social workers need licensure to provide independent , clinical services . Licensure , however , does not ensure competence to provide clinical services . Although clinical licensure typically requires completion of an MSW and two years of supervised , post-MSW experience , a social worker may or may not be ready for private practice " particularly if the social worker is not using appropriate supervision or peer consultation . Thus , just because one possesses the minimum legal prerequisite to engage in private clinical practice , this does not mean one is actually competent and ready for such practice . <p> - - - - - Before engaging in private practice , consider the knowledge and skills you will need . Consider the challenges that may arise in practice , including issues of safety for suicidal , homicidal , mentally i 'll , and other vulnerable clients you may be serving . Consider what sort of legal liability you may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decide to enter private practice , consider restricting your areas of practice to those within your areas of competence , and consider which types of services may require further training , education , and supervision . Two years after completing an MSW , for instance , you may be ready to provide cognitive-behavioral counseling to clients dealing with parenting issues and child discipline . At the same time , you may not be ready to provide forensic assessments or parenting coordination for high conflict cases referred by the courts . <p> - - - Supervision or consultation need not stop when one goes into private practice . In fact , it is generally good social work practice to continue supervision or consultation throughout one 's career , regardless of the context of practice . For some social workers , cost may seem like a barrier to securing ongoing supervision or consultation . Consider , however , the cost of supervision in relation to one malpractice lawsuit that might be avoided . Also , consider ways to reduce costs of supervision or consultation . Some supervisors offer group supervision or supervision @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meet periodically with a group of peer consultants to offer each other guidance and support . Still , note that you may need individualized , face-to-face supervision for particularly challenging situations . Private practice can feel isolating . Social work is all about human relationships ... not just with clients , but with professional peers . <p> - - - If one is a sole practitioner , an important consideration is how to ensure continuity of services if you are not able to serve clients " for instance , when you go on vacation , when you are sick , if you have an accident , and if you become incapacitated or die . All social workers should have a back-up plan for clients . In agencies , the back-up plan may be easy because other workers are available . For sole practitioners , finding a colleague to provide back-up is also very important . <p> - - - Some social workers eschew private practice because it goes against social work 's historic mission of serving the most vulnerable in society ( See Specht and Courtney 's book , Unfaithful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a thoughtful analysis of this issue ) . In private practice , clinicians may tend toward working with the more advantaged people in society . It makes sense " financially : people with money or with mental health insurance provide the clinician with a valued source of income . If one is in private practice , one 's pay depends on the fees one earns . <p> - - - So , does private practice go against the social work value of social justice ? Perhaps not . Social workers are not obligated to promote social justice or serve the most vulnerable in society at all times . However , ethically , they should do so at least some of the time . The NASW Code of Ethics suggests that fees should be fair and reasonable . Perhaps a social worker in private practice could offer some services to people in need on a sliding scale , reduced rate , or even for free . Perhaps the social worker could help the client find a sponsor or scholarship to pay for services . Further , the social worker in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to volunteer at a social agency or charitable organization . Supervising BSW or MSW students during their field placements is also a way of giving back " or paying forward " the help that the social worker has received earlier in his or her career . <p> - - - Private practice is not necessarily an either/or decision . One could have a job with a social agency and also have a part-time private practice . Of course , the worker should advise the employer and discuss any potential conflicts of interest ( e.g. , to make sure the worker is not taking clients from the agency , and to make sure the worker 's private practice obligations do not conflict with the worker 's agency obligations ) . A private practice social worker may also engage in social advocacy " promoting social justice , advancing social policy , or redressing concerns related to the worker 's own clinical practice . One challenge for the private practitioner is time . How does one balance time needed to provide service to clients ( and bring in a source of income ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or charity work ( which does not come with income ) ? Although it is a challenge , it is certainly a challenge that social workers in private practice should accept . Advancing social justice and serving those in need are the core aspects of who we are as social workers . <p> - - - If you decide to pursue private practice , make sure you do so in an ethically-minded manner . You may want to develop your knowledge and skills in an agency setting , beyond two years post-MSW . And finally , when you develop a strategic plan for private practice , make sure you consider how you can implement the values of service , competence , social justice , respect for the dignity of worth of all people , integrity , and human relationships . These values apply whether one is in private or agency-based practice . <p> Dr. Allan Barsky is Professor of Social Work at Florida Atlantic University and Chair of the National Ethics Committee of the National Association of Social Workers .

Yesterday , I referred someone to a mental health provider for his PTSD symptoms . The day before , I was helping someone locate a medical facility for an ailing family member in Sub-Saharan Africa to get tested for TB , since the family member was previously in contact with my patient who has active TB . Job duties of a public health social worker working in a TB control program definitely vary on a daily basis .

A TB social worker can assist patients with the process of getting set up with a radiologist to provide these exams . The TB social worker can also help find a provider who accepts the patient 's insurance .

Our homeless population may face the inability of staying at a specific shelter on a regular basis , thus creating a constant state of transition . This creates a problem for TB staff members attempting to locate patients to give them needed medications . A constant housing transition can also cause patients to miss doctor 's appointments . Lack of transportation can also be a problem . The TB social worker can assist by locating patients , assisting them with permanent housing options , and helping with coordinating transportation to ensure patients get to their needed TB appointments . <p> Respiratory Isolation <p> - - - Patients with active tuberculosis may need to be in respiratory isolation .

By engaging in activities that decrease your stress levels and promote physical and mental health , you will boost your resilience and initiative . Self-care practices may range from physical activities such as exercise and healthy eating to assertiveness training . Self-care mitigates occupational hazards such as burn-out and empathy fatigue . Often busy social workers , overwhelmed with demands on their time , function in survival mode . You can begin by asking yourself what your current coping mechanisms and self-care practices are and replacing any negative coping strategies with positive ones . Make a simple plan to lead you through your day and honor it , beginning with small changes . Taking the time you need to care for yourself will make you a more effective social worker ; it is not a sign of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strong , but you need backing from others- to sustain yourself . Identify your support system , whether it be colleagues , friends , or family , and seek them out . Speak with someone- you trust when you find yourself overwhelmed by a difficult situation .

Find a healthy outlet for frustration , whether it be a hobby , exercise , or spending time with someone who brings comfort to you . - <p> - - - Social workers save lives every day , and it does not mean that you are not a superhero simply because you need to recharge .

Practice Errors and the Ethics of Follow-Up <h> Mistake <p> By : Allan Barsky , JD , MSW , Ph.D . <p> Editor 's Note : I am pleased to introduce our new ethics columnist , Dr. Allan Barsky , who currently serves as the chair of the National Ethics Committee of the National Association of Social Workers . Listen to a Social Work Podcast interview with him at : LONG ... <p> Nobody is perfect . And certainly , it would be na+ve to assume that social workers are perfect in their professional practice . Yes , we strive to do the best we can through the processes of self-awareness , deliberate use of self , and critical thinking to integrate theory , knowledge , values , and observations of the people we serve . Proper education , training , supervision , and other risk management strategies can be used to promote the highest standards of practice and reduce the risks of errors . But what happens when we make a mistake " perhaps an error of judgment , an unintentional imposition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ information ? Our first inclination might be to blame others or hide the error ( Wu , 2000 ) . After all , who wants to get into trouble ? Perhaps if nobody knows , the trouble will simply go away . Perhaps not . Trying to conceal a mistake may lead to greater client anger , and perhaps more severe professional and legal consequences . This article explores the ethical issues for social workers who have erred in practice and need to determine how to follow up . <p> - - - To illustrate the importance of follow-up when social workers have erred in practice , consider the following situation . <p> - - - Chelsey is a child protection worker who was called to investigate a case in which a 13-year-old girl named Gabriele kept running away from her mother , Moira . Moira had been divorced from Gabriele 's father , Fred , for three conflict-ridden years . Moira advised Chelsey that Gabriele was running away because Fred always encouraged her to do so . Chelsey believed Moira 's allegations and initiated proceedings to restrict Gabriele 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to engage in self-harmful behaviors , including cutting her arms and pulling her hair . Although Chelsey initially viewed Fred as the primary cause of Gabriele 's distress , Chelsey started to realize that Moira may have- had borderline personality disorder and falsely accused Fred of causing a rift between Moira and Gabriele . In reality , Gabriele had been trying to extricate herself from an emotionally abusive mother . Chelsey had made matters worse by acting to cut Fred out of Gabriele 's life . <p> - - - Given this scenario , it seems clear that Chelsey initially made an improper assessment and needs to redress her errors . If she does not take appropriate action , Gabriele and Fred will continue to suffer the consequences . As a professional social worker , Chelsey has a duty to put the interests of the clients first ( NASW Code of Ethics , 2008 , Standard 1.01 ; Reamer , 2008 ) . She also has a duty to act with honesty and integrity ( Standard 4.04 ) . Despite these ethical duties , Chelsey may be reluctant to admit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reactions of her clients . What if they lodge a complaint or initiate legal proceedings against her ? She may also fear the response of her supervisor and others at the agency . What if they discipline or fire her ? Further , she may fear the reactions of coworkers , friends , and family members who may find out . How can she face the potential embarrassment , not to mention the potential loss of her job and livelihood ? <p> - - - To admit a significant practice error takes moral fortitude . Chelsey needs the strength of moral conviction to come forth and take ownership of her mistakes and commit to correcting them . This does not mean that she needs to become a martyr , surrendering herself for undue punishment and suffering . There are ways to proceed with integrity , but also with support , strategy , and caution . Whenever a social worker thinks she has committed a significant practice error , the worker should consider consulting with the following sources of help : <p> - - - Attorney " Attorneys can provide legal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This means that the social worker can consult with her own attorney with the assurance that the attorney can not be called to testify against her . The worker could also consult with the agency 's attorney . However , the worker should understand that this attorney works for the agency , not for the individual worker . Although the agency attorney may provide advice , the worker should know that agency interests and the worker 's personal interests might not coincide ( e.g. , if the agency decides to lay blame on an individual worker for acting on her own , to protect the agency as a whole from legal liability ) . Accordingly , consulting one 's own attorney may be preferable . Attorneys can provide advice about the best way to redress errors , for instance , through confidential mediation processes so that conflicts can be resolved without the need for court . An attorney can also advise the worker about self-reporting errors to the NASW and/or to a relevant social work licensing board . The consequences for a self-reported error may be less severe than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worker has taken responsibility for her actions . <p> - - - NASW Office of Ethics and Professional Review ( OEPR ) " NASW members may call the OEPR for ethics consultation ( 800-638-8799 ) . The OEPR does not provide case-specific advice or tell members what to do . The OEPR can help members identify relevant ethical standards and risks to manage . It can also identify other resources for support . <p> - - - Liability Insurance Company " Workers who have liability insurance may contact their insurance providers for consultation on whether the insurance will cover certain errors . In fact , many insurance policies require that workers report errors to them . The company may offer direction on how to proceed with the case . Insurance may also cover the costs of legal advice and representation . Workers should know that once they report a possible error , their future insurance rates and eligibility for insurance might be affected . They should also know that consequences with the insurance company might be more severe if they do not self-report . <p> - - - Clinical supervisor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supervisees . Social workers should generally make use of supervision to help them deal with difficult situations , including how to follow up when an error has been made . If a worker has a strong , trusting relationship with the supervisor , it will be easier to discuss such problems and work toward the best resolution possible ( Barsky , 2010 ) . Ideally , the supervisor will focus on taking corrective rather than punitive actions . Supervisors should recognize that admitting a mistake is a positive step , and that the practitioner may need the supervisor 's full support in order to deal with the stress and to develop an effective corrective strategy . <p> - - - When discussing how to deal with a practice error , social workers should address whether and how to disclose the error to the clients ( Wu , Cavanaugh , McPhee , Lo , &amp; Micco , 1997 ) . The timing and manner of the disclosure may be crucial to how the client responds ( Wu , 2000 ) . Often , a prompt , honest , and open apology @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will help resolve the issue in an amicable manner . Regardless of the best efforts of a practitioner to apologize and make good , one can not guarantee a forgiving and friendly response by the client ( Berlinger &amp; Wu , 2005 ) . When there is the potential for legal liability , be sure to consult an attorney before making any disclosures to the client . <p> - - - Some agencies , particularly hospitals and medical facilities , have specific procedures for handling reporting errors . For instance , errors may need to be reported to risk management officers or an agency ethics committee . There may be legal protections for reporting errors , although these should be discussed with an attorney . For instance , social workers acting in a quasi-judicial role may be protected by the legal concept of quasi-judicial immunity . Child protection workers , for instance , are generally protected from civil lawsuits provided that they act in good faith . <p> - - - In the case situation described above , Chelsey should have been consulting with her agency supervisor and attorney throughout @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her initial assessment was inaccurate , she should go back to her supervisor and agency attorney to provide them with her new information and assessments . Although she may feel embarrassed and anxious about initiating these discussions , her ethical obligations to her clients , her agency , the social work profession , and herself suggest that she should take corrective action . <p> - - - Chelsey 's supervisor and agency attorney may be able to assist with a plan of action and support . For instance , the supervisor might suggest that a new worker be assigned to work with Gabriele and her family . The new worker would have the advantage of starting fresh , building a positive relationship , making an independent assessment of the family 's situation , and ensuring that everyone is treated fairly . <p> - - - Chelsey , the supervisor , and attorney should also assess what went awry , in order to ensure that similar errors to do not arise in the future . Does Chelsey need additional training ? Does the supervisor need to change her style of supervision @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within families like Gabriele 's ? How can the attorney help ensure that workers are relying on good evidence before initiating legal actions that can impinge parental rights ? When agencies recognize and review errors , they should look retrospectively and prospectively " what has happened , how can we take corrective steps to redress the error , and what steps can we take to ensure better practice going forward ? <p> Dr. Allan Barsky is Professor of Social Work at Florida Atlantic University and Chair of the National Ethics Committee of the National Association of Social Workers .

@@100125544 @4325544/ <h> Is My Degree Accredited ? <h> Is My Degree Accredited ? <p> by Robert Blundo , Ph.D. , ACSW <p> University of North Carolina at Wilmington <p> Many students are presently attending bachelor 's level social work programs not accredited by the Council on Social Work Education ( CSWE ) . This is quickly changing as programs and their institutions are moving toward accredited status . As of this past February , CSWE has listed 393 accredited baccalaureate programs and 28 programs in candidacy . <p> What is Accreditation ? <p> There are two basic accreditations for any BSW program . First , there is the accreditation maintained by the college or institution for the conferring of the baccalaureate degree . Usually , a regional and a state commission or association of higher education grants this accreditation to the institution . This means that a bachelor 's degree ( BS or BA ) with a major in social work or a BSW degree is an accredited undergraduate degree . It meets the same standards as any other degree conferred by the college or institution . The second type @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ specific field of study . A commission or council concerned with that particular area of study confers this additional accreditation . For example , many business schools within college settings maintain accreditation from the American Assembly of Collegiate Schools of Business . This secondary accreditation is important . It standardizes the basic curriculum and structure of the programs so that graduates are recognized by other institutions as having completed a comparable course of study . <p> It is this supplemental accreditation that is conferred by CSWE . All accredited BSW programs have a social work curriculum that follows CSWE guidelines for educating students as generalist social work practitioners . To meet the accreditation standards , the program must fulfill additional CSWE requirements . There are requirements for ( a ) the number and experience of social work faculty , ( b ) the program 's autonomy in carrying out its goals and program planning , ( c ) the program must have its own budget , and ( d ) the program must have authority in hiring and promotion of its faculty and must be assigned support staff . These @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Many can meet the curriculum requirements but struggle to meet the structural requirements of CSWE . <p> Our society is demanding accountability and justification of the work done by many in the helping fields . Many states are establishing licensing or certification requirements for individuals who want to use the title of social worker and perform certain social work tasks . Graduating from a CSWE-accredited program is increasingly a part of meeting these standards . This is particularly important regarding the MSW degree and less significant ( depending on the state ) for the BSW degree . <p> What is Candidacy ? <p> The road to accreditation is hard and time-consuming . To begin with , the college or institution must decide to undertake the effort . It requires a commitment of funds to support the staff and to possibly hiring new social work faculty , depending upon the size of the program . The faculty must dedicate considerable time to researching and writing up the feasibility study documenting the need for the program in the community . Later , a detailed description of the program 's structure within the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the curriculum must be completed . Usually , this takes one to two years . A member of the commission on accreditation reviews these eligibility documents and recommends or does not recommend that the program enter candidacy . If the program is found in compliance to proceed toward accreditation , the program is accepted into candidacy . This acceptance starts a two-year process during which further elaborate descriptions of the program and curriculum are documented and hopefully approved . Accreditation is awarded if the program meets all the requirements . <p> What Students Need to Know and Do <p> It is important to specifically ask if your program is accredited by CSWE . If the program is not accredited , ask if they are in candidacy and when they expect to be accredited . If the program is in candidacy and you will graduate after the accreditation date , then you will have graduated from an accredited program . <p> If , however , the program is in candidacy and does not expect to be accredited before you graduate , then ask specifically ( this is very important ) if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now taking prior to accreditation . If the curriculum under which the program receives accreditation is changed significantly , the program can not " grandfather " you in as having graduated from an accredited program . Only if you graduate from the program with substantially the same curriculum as that to be approved for accreditation will you be seen as graduating from an accredited program . <p> It is important to find out if the state in which you want to practice at the BSW level has licensing or certification requirements for BSW social workers . If they do , then it is important to find out the consequences for not graduating from a CSWE-accredited program in terms of specific job opportunities . Contact those agencies or services you would be interested in working for and ask specifically about your circumstances and their employment policies . Many agencies hire individuals with bachelor 's degrees other than the BSW . In these situations , accreditation would not be an issue in terms of that specific agency and job description . <p> If you graduate from a program in candidacy , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you had graduated from an accredited program . Check this out with each school to which you apply . <p> If you graduate from a nonaccredited program , graduate schools will not penalize you for admission into the regular two-year MSW program . Those programs that have advanced standing will not accept you into advanced standing . Many of these programs have limited enrollment in advanced standing and graduating from an accredited BSW program will not guarantee you acceptance into advanced standing . <p> Accreditation is an important issue for students . I do think that at the bachelor 's level , it should not be the only reason for selecting a program or transferring out of a program . It is important to look at the curriculum , faculty , and field opportunities . This is particularly so if you plan to attend graduate school . Accreditation does not guarantee that you will have the best learning experiences . Do not panic . Ask the questions listed above and think of your plans before making a decision about the program .

" Nine years later , I know that this is kind of a condescending approach , if you take it literally . Who am I to tell people how to live their lives ? People know best what they want from life , what values they are striving for , and what specific behavior is standing in their way of living those values .

As I grew up in a home with a mother who works as a social worker , becoming a social worker myself was a given . Eager to get back to work and not fall behind , my mother only took about two months off after I was born before going back to work . She took me along to work with her to eliminate costs of daycare and ensure herself that her work was not falling behind . Numerous people helped her out by taking care of me during the work day . Once I was of school age , I did not have to spend time with her in the senior center ; however , I still chose to go to work with her on my days off from school or have a family member take me in after my school day was complete . I had become close with all of her co-workers and the members @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to miss out on their normal day . It was nice knowing people recognized my face and wanted me to talk to them . <p> - - - - As I got older , I still had a love for working with older people and following my mother around at work . It became so natural for me and something I loved and appreciated . My senior year of high school , I had an opportunity to have an internship during my school day . During my last semester of high school , I spent four hours each day interning at the senior center as part of my graduation requirements . It was one of the best experiences of my life . Not only was it nice to be in the field working and helping individuals , but I gained a lot of connections and learned about resources that I may never have gotten a chance to do . <p> - - - - Therefore , my biggest inspiration to become a social worker is my mother .

My supervisor specializes in gender and orientation issues and sees many clients of this nature . I am familiar with this population , as I am a part of the LGBTQIA+ community myself , but I definitely do not consider myself an expert .

In 1992-1993 , 229 students were awarded the doctoral degree by Schools of Social Work responding to a Council on Social Work Education ( CSWE ) survey reported on in Statistics on Social Work Education in the United States : 1993 . But according to a recent report , approximately 400 social work faculty openings are advertised per year . <p> What does this mean for aspiring social work educators ?

" However , it also opens doors for interdisciplinary collaboration and contact as well as with agencies interested in conducting research . I have known people to go into agency work ( research positions or administrative positions ) as well as positions in the government , both research and policy . " <p> Opportunities also exist for social workers to work with college students outside the classroom . Jack Curran , a Ph.D . student at the State University of New York Albany , works part-time in the counseling center at Manhattan College in New York .

" Because I had graduated recently from the same school of social work , the admission procedure was quite straightforward , " says Cynthia Tandy , MSW , a Ph.D . student at the University of Georgia School of Social Work in Athens . " As I remember , it was just a matter of an application form . " <p> Of 1375 hopefuls who completed similar applications in 1993 , 590 were accepted . Admissions requirements are similar from program to program . Typical requirements include the following : <p> master 's in social work from a CSWE-accredited program or a closely related discipline <p> two years of work experience in social work or human services ( this is sometimes waived for highly qualified candidates ) <p> Graduate Record Examination ( GRE ) score set by the school <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whom English is a second language ) <p> strong commitment to the profession 's values , goals , and purposes <p> commitment to scholarly work congruent with the objectives and resources of the doctoral program <p> superior academic ability . <p> Application materials , in addition to a formal application , may include the following : <p> transcripts of undergraduate and graduate work <p> professional and personal letters of recommendation <p> examples of scholarly writing <p> personal statement of the applicant 's interests and objectives <p> vita . <p> A personal interview may also be required . <p> What 's It Like ? <p> Some people hold on to the old stereotype of doctoral candidates as " perpetual students " --people who keep going to school because they do n't know what else to do or because they do n't want to grow up . But is doctoral work just an extension of the earlier educational process ? <p> To the contrary , most who are going through it will agree that doctoral education is much more exacting than their previous educational experiences . " I found the Ph.D . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than the MSW , " says Randy Magen . " The Ph.D . program necessarily focused on developing research skills . " <p> Says Cynthia Tandy of her program , " Overall , the program is quite academic , with an increased emphasis on research , writing , and demonstrating an accumulation of knowledge . It 's more demanding and challenging than the MSW program was . I guess I 'd describe it as intense , interesting , and stimulating . " Most projects , she explains , are done independently , so there is less of the camaraderie one might find in a master 's level program , where there are more group projects and classes taken together . <p> The actual content of the doctoral program varies from school to school . While the Council on Social Work Education ( CSWE ) provides a mechanism for supplemental accreditation for social work programs at the bachelor 's and master 's levels , there is no such accreditation at the doctoral level . <p> The Group for the Advancement of Doctoral Education ( GADE ) , founded about 20 years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says that doctoral programs do not need such supplemental accreditation , but should instead develop within the philosophy of the host institution . Nevertheless , GADE has developed guidelines for doctoral programs in social work . Schools are not required , but are encouraged , to follow these guidelines . <p> " .... In most programs students focus their studies on advanced courses in a substantive area of specialization and on research and statistical methodology , " says GADE chairperson Enola K. Proctor , of the Washington University George Warren Brown School of Social Work in St. Louis . " This focus is consistent with the purpose of doctoral education , to prepare individuals to conduct research to advance the social work knowledge base . " She explains that many , but not all , programs require a research and/or teaching practicum . Qualifying examinations , preparation of a dissertation proposal , and completion of dissertation research are also required . <p> Typically , a full-time student can complete doctoral course work in two years , with an additional one to two years for the dissertation . <p> Paying for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the Ph.D . waters , money is often available , usually in the form of teaching or research assistantships . At the University of Georgia , says Cindy Tandy , assistantships pay about $7500 a year , and tuition is waived . Students often work part-time , as she does at the United Way of Metropolitan Atlanta , for additional income and experience . There are also university-wide assistantships , in addition to School of Social Work assistantships , she explains . <p> According to CSWE , 597 social work doctoral students received financial aid in 1993 .

I knew I wanted to become a social worker . But I also knew desire alone would not carry me through my course work . I questioned my ability to do the academic work . I questioned whether or not I should even return to school . I had not been a full-time student for over twenty years . In fact , I questioned just about everything related to school . <p> Between my undergraduate and graduate years , I had the luxury of choosing books to read of any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over timeless prose . That approach to reading changed after my first class on the first day of graduate school . The luxury of reading for pleasure was suddenly gone . As a graduate student , I had to be self-disciplined and follow a strict reading schedule . Over the course of a term , I had to read lots of books and become conversant on what I had read . I made daily , weekly , and monthly reading lists . My house started to look like a miniature library . Books were strategically placed so as to remind me of my reading requirements . Adhering to a tight and full reading schedule was one of several responsibilities I had to attend to in order to succeed in graduate school . <p> For me , graduate school meant a lot of hard work and balancing priorities . I had to coordinate reading , research , class work , writing papers , preparing for class presentations , and so on . Then about the time I became moderately comfortable with managing class work , I had to find a practicum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all occurred in my first quarter . I was concerned that entering a master ' in social work program might not be a good idea for me . <p> Then things began to click . Writing research papers , for example , was not new to me . As an undergraduate student in American history , I had been trained in research . Writing in APA style was new to me . Writing a ten-plus page research paper in APA style was a daunting task . Perusing through the APA Publication Manual made me anxious . How would I master the precise writing expected of graduate level work ? How would I even think of a suitable topic ? <p> Writing a graduate-level research paper was one of my first challenges and one of my first significant successes . I had to think carefully about it and immerse myself into the assignment . I do n't recall exactly how I navigated each step . But I do know that components of my success included hard work and focus and lots of time in the library and at my computer . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ available and involved in helping . Having a research professor who would make time for me to have lengthy conversations about my research and the attendant questions played an important role . <p> Other challenges piled on . I had no idea whether I could stand up and make a presentation to my class , for example . I had spent over 14 years teaching in a high school classroom , but that meant nothing compared to addressing my peers . Presentations were just as much a part of the program as writing papers . My response , again , was hard work , focus and tap into my professional resources . I researched and practiced my assigned topic . I went to the library , searched the Internet , interviewed people in person , and talked to people on the phone . I wrote and re-wrote my presentations . My strategy was to overlearn the subject matter . After several presentations , each one a little more successful than the last , I became more confident in my ability to present to my classmates . I spoke with more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ statistics class presented another challenge . Unlike writing papers and giving presentations , I had little faith that my simply working hard would be enough to get me through stats class . The fact that none of my classmates was any more comfortable with statistics than I was did little to placate my uneasiness . I knew beyond any doubt that stats class would be dreadful . <p> Because I had a gifted professor , however , my first day in research and statistics class was n't that bad . With her informal and reassuring style , my professor disquieted my fears and instilled in me hope that I could succeed in her class . As the term progressed , I began to see the many applications research and statistics have in the field of social work . The class was actually intriguing . With lots of weekend hours spent on homework , I successfully surmounted the class . In the end , statistics and research became one of my favorite classes . <p> Obtaining a practicum placement was yet another hurdle . Although I knew from the outset that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not fully appreciate how competitive the market was . There were few placements , and many students scrambled for internships . Securing a placement would take determination and resourcefulness . I started out by meeting with the college director of field placement . She was supportive and encouraging , but it was clear that finding a placement would be my undertaking , not hers . <p> I began by copying down phone numbers and addresses from the telephone book of all the agencies that might have potential placements . I called and explained who I was and what I was calling about . I hoped to make a connection to move to the next step , which was to meet for an interview . I crossed names off my list much faster than I entered interview dates on my calendar . Sometimes a phone call would lead to another agency that was n't on my list . For several weeks , if I was n't writing a paper , studying for an exam , or reading class material , I was focused on finding a placement . I was able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calling and interviewing , I gained confidence and was able to refine more closely the idea of what I wanted to do . <p> The course work , the interaction with classmates and professors , and then , the interaction with clients in my practicum brought my work together . I came to value my practicum experience . It was the best of both worlds . I gained experience with clients while still in the safety of my academic program . Once again , I could use my professors ' expertise for insight and skill development while gaining confidence in working independently with clients . <p> My master ' in social work program has been an awakening experience for me . A professor told my incoming class at orientation that we would change over the course of our program . At the time , I wondered what he meant .

@@100125667 @4325667/ <h> Traversing the Academic Terrain : A Bi-Focal Approach to Publishing in Social Work <p> To publish or perish has long been the mantra in academic departments of higher education ( Burgan , 2003 ; Euben , 2002 ) . Both traditionally and philosophically , the impetus to publish has been based largely on the value and necessity of knowledge production and its dissemination , and to further the development of a disciplinary field 's particular knowledge base . Increasingly , however , faculty members are pressured to publish to secure governmental and professional funding for their universities and academic departments ( McGrail , Rickard , &amp; Jones , 2006 ) and perhaps , most importantly , to secure academic security or tenure. - - <p> - - - Despite these realities of academic life , publication rates still remain fairly low across academic disciplines ( McGrail et al. , 2006 ) . The highest rates of both manuscript submissions and actual publications among social work faculty , for example , may be found among males , those with doctorates , and those who 've already attained tenure , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in a review of three leading journals in higher education , Hart ( 2006 ) found that the publication rates for women in academia who submitted articles to peer-reviewed journals averaged only 16% in the years between 1990 and 2002 , despite the fact that American women have now earned more doctorates than American men ( Smallwood , 2003 ) . - Moreover , in some universities , the publishing bar is set at what is perceived to be an unreasonable and , at times , unreachable height , and , consequently , many academic faculty members experience tenure anxiety ( Burgan , 2003 ) . <p> - - - Nonetheless , publishing peer-reviewed articles is considered the coin of the realm in academia . In today 's market , even newly minted social work Ph.D.s will already be expected to have peer-reviewed articles in their portfolios if they hope to be competitive in their quest for tenure-track faculty positions . This article will describe a bi-focal approach to academic writing and publishing , both for social work doctoral students and for junior faculty . By achieving a bi-focal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ academic life ( e.g. , writing research papers , developing syllabi , teaching classes , building community partnerships , conducting research ) " and also the forest " the goal of completing a dissertation or achieving tenure " one should be able to successfully traverse the social work academic landscape . Thus , to begin this metaphorical journey , put on your bi-focals ! <p> Fear and Loathing : On Becoming a Doctoral Student <p> - - - Beginning doctoral education can seem like an overwhelming task ; even choosing the programs to which one should apply can seem foreboding . However , in the spirit of a bi-focal approach of seeing both the forest and the trees , you may first wish to give some considered thought to your choice of social work doctoral programs . In addition to geographic locale , financial costs , funding and scholarship opportunities , and the prestige of a particular program , you may wish also to first identify faculty who have expertise in your specific areas of scholarly interest . Indeed , successful mentoring and supportive relationships can be the most salient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ publications ( McGrail et al. , 2006 ) across academic disciplines . Although the path to a successful academic career may be long and , at times , arduous , you can begin to think about your first academic social work position even before you fill out your initial applications to doctoral programs . <p> - - - Once you 've decided on the doctoral programs to which you will apply , you need to begin the process of preparing your applications . Depending upon the admissions requirements of particular institutions , you may need to arrange to take the Graduate Record Exam ( GRE ) or other standardized entrance examinations , obtain undergraduate and graduate academic records , and politely cajole professors , supervisors , colleagues , and personal friends/acquaintances to write recommendation letters to seemingly fearsome admission committees . Also , you may be asked to compose a finely wrought , personal essay and clear statement of research and scholarly goals to persuade committee members of your worthiness to be admitted into their esteemed institution . Often , all this angst takes place even before you 've started @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and tumult , you have been lucky enough to be admitted into a doctoral program , doubts may ensue as to whether you are capable of traversing the academic terrain of doctoral life . <p> - - - With visions of Sisyphus dancing in your head , you may wonder just how many gravity-defying boulders you will have to single-handedly push up the mountain to finally reach its summit . There will be hours of reading and writing , taking mind-numbing courses in statistics , passing certification exams , writing qualifying papers , choosing your dissertation committee ( if you 're allowed latitude in that regard ) , identifying your research topic , gaining access to data , writing and defending your dissertation proposal and final dissertation , navigating the inevitable politics of academic departments , and all while you 're barely subsisting on your graduate stipend . And , by the way , why was it that you decided to quit your job in the first place to apply to a doctoral program ? <p> - - - Now is the time for you to take a deep breath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forest and the trees of the academic landscape . As a starting point , it may be helpful to begin to develop an academic plan that encompasses your particular area of scholarly interest . This will guide you as you take required courses , choose advisors , and later , pick electives . Remember , you will probably be devoting at least three or more years developing your final dissertation project , so you 'll want to choose a subject for which you have a real passion . If you simultaneously focus on both the forest and the trees of the doctoral landscape , the uncharted wilderness will slowly begin to take form and shape . Not only can each class project or paper you complete throughout your educational experience potentially become a part or chapter of the dissertation ; it can also be developed into a peer-reviewed article . <p> - - - Many graduate students and new academics find the prospect of academic writing and publishing to be overwhelming . Identifying the barriers to academic publishing and then discovering ways to overcome them may greatly assist aspiring academics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ McGrail et al. , 2006 ) identified three general intervention strategies designed to increase publication output . These included : 1 ) short-term , didactic writing courses ; 2 ) longer-term support groups ; and 3 ) the use of writing coaches ( p. 19 ) . Whereas all interventions yielded statistically significant results , support groups and the use of coaches and other mentors yielded the best overall results in publication rates ( p. 33-34 ) . Indeed , Berger ( 1990 ) identified the particular need for social work academics to develop mentoring relationships to improve publication rates . Thus , the importance of supportive relationships may be the most salient variable in improving publication rates . <p> Taking up My Author(ity) : A Personal Case Example <p> - - - When I entered the Columbia University School of Social Work as a doctoral student in the fall of 1995 , I had some idea that I wanted to study the issue of authority . I was interested in learning how I could better take up my own personal and professional authority and have an impact on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in a way that respected their autonomy and right to self-determination . - <p> - - - As I worked full time in a busy outpatient mental health center , the completion of the doctoral program took a period of nine years . During that time , I published five peer-reviewed journal articles , all of which had originally been mid-term and final papers submitted for my doctoral coursework . Additionally , each one of these publications later formed the basis for various chapters in my dissertation . The time and research invested in class papers and other program requirements not only laid the groundwork for each chapter of my final dissertation , but also resulted in peer-reviewed publications . <p> - - - Thus , for example , the first paper accepted for publication was based on a final paper that I had written for a class on the ecological perspective in social work practice . My instructor had written some very encouraging comments on my final paper and had suggested that I think about converting the paper into a manuscript for publication . At the time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and continued to make my way through the doctoral program , while also juggling a number of other professional and personal obligations . <p> - - - I went through a similar process with three other papers I had written to fulfill course requirements . For me , the turning point in converting my course papers into manuscripts was the help of a colleague from another college , who was already on the tenure track and had published prolifically in his field of study . During a visit , I showed him my work and he was very impressed at the enormity of the research I had invested in my class papers " the same substantial research that all doctoral students must invest in their work . He volunteered to assist me in turning my papers into manuscripts . <p> - - - He had extensive editorial experience and expertise and was very productive and efficient in his use of time . Before long , several of the papers I had written for classes had been converted into manuscripts . Eventually , they were all published in peer-reviewed journals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ process of completing my doctoral studies and producing peer-reviewed articles , I was able , in part , to fulfill my initial goal to better take up my personal and professional authority . I also learned how to roll with the punches , so to speak , so that if a manuscript was rejected by a particular editor , I simply incorporated the reviewers ' suggestions and quickly resubmitted the manuscript to another journal for review . <p> - - - With the exception of conducting my primary research and analyzing the ensuing data , the bulk of my dissertation took shape through importing various papers I had previously completed throughout my tenure in the doctoral program . Thus , by the time I graduated in the fall of 2004 , I was able to go on the job market with four completed peer-reviewed publications and one in press . <p> - - - Having successfully landed my first academic position , I continued to follow the same process of attempting to see simultaneously the forest and the trees . All academic endeavors , whether teaching a course , establishing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collaborating with colleagues , or conducting research on one 's own , can provide opportunities for academic writing and publishing . <p> Conclusion <p> - - - It is important to use a bi-focal approach to academic writing and publishing , both in one 's doctoral education and also as one becomes a junior faculty member . It is useful to identify supportive mentors who may offer help and assistance in beginning the process of converting academic papers to manuscripts . By remaining focused on both the forest and the trees , a doctoral student may be able to both develop and later produce peer-reviewed articles and also work toward the successful completion of a dissertation . By remembering to maintain an integrated focus on teaching , service and , especially , academic publishing , a junior faculty member may be similarly successful in navigating the journey toward academic tenure . <p> Smallwood , S.

This makes sense , since the other professions do n't accredit bachelor 's level education programs and do n't recognize that level as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States either mandate licensure for BSW level practitioners or provide for a voluntary certification . By becoming licensed or certified , you add a credential to your rsum that speaks to professionalism and once again insures prospective employers of a level of competence . A state credential-be it mandatory or voluntary-can help give you an edge with prospective employers , as it is something that only BSWs can get and can therefore help to set you apart from other bachelor 's level practitioners . <p> Identify yourself <p> As strong as the BSW degree is , simply having one does n't guarantee employment . Many employers do n't fully understand the difference between a BSW and other bachelor 's level practitioners , which is why you need to be familiar with the difference and use that knowledge when putting together a rsum and interviewing . This also means that BSW level practitioners can help themselves by identifying with the social work profession and identifying themselves as social work professionals . Too often , that does n't happen at the bachelor 's level , and graduates do n't think of themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work PROFESSIONALS . <p> Organizations like NASW do much for BSW level practitioners by publicizing the degree and advocating with employers , but the best advocacy is provided by practicing BSWs who have a strong professional identity . Having a great BSW on staff will convince an employer that hiring a social worker is the way to go . <p> Where are the jobs ? Everywhere ! <p> There are vast numbers of jobs available for bachelor 's level practition-ers , but the types of jobs , the way they are advertised , and the competition for them is very different at the BSW level than at the MSW level . At the MSW level , many jobs have " social work " in the job title or description , and the employers clearly state that an MSW is required . It is obvious that they only want an MSW and will not consider those with master 's degrees in other fields . This often is not the case at the bachelor 's level . At the bachelor 's level , many jobs do not carry the title " social @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human service degree . ( This gets us back to why it is so important to understand why the BSW degree is unique and strong , as it helps you sell yourself above all the others with four-year human service degrees . ) <p> Jobs for bachelor 's level practitioners typically have titles such as habilitation specialist , mental health assistant , group home worker , residential counselor , teaching parent , program coordinator , activity director , workshop director , and so on . Therefore , when looking in the classified sections of newspapers , employment openings for BSWs can be found under almost any heading . If you are a BSW , do n't make the mistake of looking only under headings that are titled " professional , " " health care , " or " social services . " Be sure to look under " part-time , " " miscellaneous , " " administrative/clerical , " and the like . Social work jobs can be found just about everywhere in classified ad sections , except perhaps " sales " and " hospitality . " <p> I regularly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and did n't see any jobs for BSWs , only MSWs . I 'll look through the same paper and see lots of bachelor 's level human service positions listed , because I look everywhere and I do n't just look for the words " social work . " Those agencies that utilize bachelor 's level practitioners include , but are not limited to , Departments of Social Services , particularly in rural settings ; county health and home health agencies in rural settings ; group homes for those who are developmentally delayed , mentally retarded , or emotionally i 'll ; sheltered workshops ; and nursing homes . <p> Be flexible <p> The BSW degree is more marketable in rural settings than in urban ones , because there is less competition . There are many social service directors in North Carolina , for example , who say they would hire a BSW almost sight unseen , as they simply ca n't find BSWs . In more urban areas , however , many employers tend not to hire BSWs , as they have so many MSWs applying for their job openings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to relocate or commute to their place of employment much more often than an MSW would . <p> In addition , a professional-looking and easy-to-read rsum , as well as solid interview skills , become even more important at the BSW level and in today 's market . With our current political climate , there are attempts to cut many services that typically hire social workers and other human service professionals . This means that competition is stiff , as there are fewer opportunities available for everyone . <p> Because of the visibility and credibility of the social work profession , social workers as a whole definitely have the edge in the job market . However , a sloppy rsum and poor social skills will quickly kill any edge that the profession has created for you . <p> Keep in mind that in ALL professions , having a master 's degree makes one more sought after and carries with it a higher salary . Having a master 's degree does make one more marketable in the social work profession , just as in any other profession , but there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Knowing what sets you apart from the rest , identifying yourself as a social work professional , knowing where and how to look for employment , and staying flexible in your options should lead you into a lifelong social work career , whether you remain at the BSW level or go on to get a master 's . <p> Kathy Boyd , ACSW , CMSW , is executive director of the National Association of Social Workers , North Carolina Chapter . <h> Tags <h> Comments ( 6 ) <h> BSW is not worth the money or time ! <p> Going to school for a BSW is a waste . The Social Work profession only promotes jobs for MSW .

All the way around . <p> I met a woman in Starbucks today . She overheard me talking to a friend behind the counter about school . She shared that she dropped out six weeks prior to graduation from a MSW program in another state . Said she could n't reconcile her own beliefs about addiction with the disease concept . Even though she , like me , lost her sister to addiction . <p> I lost a sister and a brother . My mother and my father struggled with addictions most of their lives . I believe alcoholism and drug addiction are diseases . <p> She thinks people need to get over it . I know it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ program is too much work for $30,000 dollars a year . Tell me I can make more than that ! I know I can . <p> Here 's the real deal : I am hungry , angry , lonely and tired . I have been on the road , in the office , on the job , at field practice , did n't get to have dinner with my husband , my dog does n't remember me and .... <h> 27 comments : <p> TJ , I have always felt that my MSW was worth it ! The great thing about an MSW is that you can do SO many things with it . There are so many career directions you can take . I do n't know what the salaries are like in your area , but I believe that you can make a decent living as a social worker . To me , it is a satisfying and rewarding career , and I have met some incredibly wonderful people in social work , too . You have been through a lot with the addictions and loss in your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You know it 's not " that simple , " as you said . Being a social worker or a social work student is n't always simple , either , but to me , it is worth it . <p> Well , I just started the program and have not yet entered field , and have no background in the field either . However , listen to your heart . You are always going to have those moments where you doubt yourself , the methods and interventions , the theories . However , if you believe that you can make a difference in someone else 's life , whether it be 1 person or a 1000 , then you have fulfilled your mission as a Social Worker . <p> I graduated with my MSW last May and once you are done with all the courses , papers , and field work you feel like you have accomplished something great that no one can take away from you . I have grown in so many ways and learned a lot about myself by completing the MSW program . Even though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not by any means over once you graduate with your MSW , since you are always learning , it is something that you can carry with you forever . Being a social worker is something to be proud of you will be able to help people in many different ways . <p> Hey there . You 're in the thick of it now and it 's totally normal to be freaking out and feel overwhelmed . You 'll get through this ! I 've always noticed that it 's easy to get down about social work when you listen to people outside of the profession talk about it . It 's a job that is n't right for everyone , but it is the perfect profession for many of us ! As for the salary , I graduated with my MSW this past May and promptly doubled my previous salary . For me it was an excellent return on my investment . Good luck ! <p> Although I 'm living in Germany and not in U.S.A. I sometimes hear similar meanings like you are referring to.In Germany social work jobs are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But since I 'm working together with people of different professions I have learned that my colleagues and I are much happier and more satisfied in their jobs.While we have much deeper insight in peoples problems and have to be sensitive for clienstfeelings , the other professions have to cope with much more routine.There are so many different parts in our work that a social worker will never have that routine that can become dull and tiring . <p> In my work I have to give help and attendance to people with addictions and/or psychological diseases.Some have become my clients because they can not stand the tiring routine in their jobs.As far as Im concerned I think social work is an exciting kind of work.I would not like to change with anyoneelseand there are still so many things I have to learn.So you see also in Germany social workers experience a very exciting time in their jobs . <p> T.J. Of course you 're feeling overwhelmed with your schedule . I 'm in my first year as an MSW student , and I do n't nearly have your schedule , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in there , this wo n't last forever , and you 'll be so happy once you 're done . It seems like you were made for this type of work . Betsy <p> I will start the MSW program in Sept . I love reading your posts ! When feeling distressed , try and focus on the AHA moment you had when you knew that this profession felt right to you . This is your gut talking to you and when you take the time ( as you did ) to listen , all else will fall in place . Hang in there ! Sharon <p> I have been an LCSW for about 20 yrs . There is much satisfaction in working with clients and respect from those clients . Unfortunately , society does not give our profession much respector good pay . I am a manager and make about $41,000 . School social work pays better and you could make more in private practice or working for a managed care company . I would be open minded about where you can get a job . Surprisingly , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of support that social workers sometimes get from their co-workers . Advice : rise as fast as you can and as far as you can in the profession to make the most money . <p> Social Work can be like the army : the hardest job you will ever love ! It helps to look at your motivation to do this work . If you have unresolved issues get therapy . Some of the best practitioners I know did this and went on to be outstanding in the area they thought they could never deal with . My own experiences with therapy has helped me appreciate the struggle we all experience being human and as a result , flawed . I respect the process and the power of the therapeutic relationship as the ultimate instrument for change . I have been in this field for over 20 years . Despite all the negatives I have experienced over the years for a variety of reasons , one thing that never changed was my love of the actual work with clients . I will never miss administration , sociopathic supervisors , community @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through hell in the past 5 years personally and professionally and out of these experiences I now do what is important to me which is counseling . I do n't miss my big office with windows nor do I miss my high powered title . I no longer complain about going to work . I am excited by the changes that people make when we work together . My reinforcement is the healing that takes place through their motivation and my skills . I have found what I love to do . I make less money as a contract therapist but compared to the enjoyment I get from it I hope to never be an administrator again . However , I still love supervising and teaching students . To help someone to learn how to be a healer reinforces what I do every day . One of my mentors taught me that effective use of self was the cornerstone of effective interventions . I get to do this in my little corner of heaven every day . Because I love what I do and it reflects to my clients I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Good luck with whatever you decide . <p> TJ , I was a non-traditional student getting my BSW at the ripe old ( tongue in cheek ) age of 55 and my MSW at 57 . I got into the field through a life experience and had no goal of going on past my MSW . My academic advisor still reminds me of that to this day . I did go on for many reasons---the " kids " I went through undergrad w/begged me to ( seriously ) ; the increased passion for social work and desire to learn even more ; employers seem to want that MSW versus BSW and in my area , some want LCSW ; the increase in income . But mostly , I wanted to be able to give back just an iota of what I had received through my life experience . After four years in the medical field , I still feel rewarded when I see the skills I developed reach someone and make a positive change in their life . I love what I do and hope that it reflects in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I work with . As someone else mentioned , each day that I go to work , I never know what I am going to find because there are so many facets to social work . I may be $12,000 in debt for grad school and probably going remain close friends w/MOHELA when I go to the nursing home , but it was money well spent . Hang in there ! <p> You can do this ! You can make more than $30,000 a year , but set your sights on doing a job that is fulfilling intrinsically ... Social Workers do not get into this field to stack their bank accounts . We do it for the greater good of our society ; because we feel that we have something to offer for those in need ; because we know that with a little support people have the ability to make life changing decisions , just as you did when you began your MSW schooling . When you feel like it is too much to manage , all that you are taking on , think about the families with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same way . Use your ability to get through this to relate to those families in need and be thankful that you have the opportunity to do so . Keep pushing , and look and the small steps and changes that people make as you work with them . Remember , you are only one piece of a large puzzle and you can not do everything . Do the best that you can and you have nothing to worry about . <p> TJ , I received my MSW in 1999 and do not regret it one bit . It takes a select few of us to enter into this field of social work as it is challenging work that , yes does take us away from our families , questions our priorities at times and can stress you out ( if you let it ) . Experience , a good support system and keeping yourself healthy will help you to be the best for the people you serve . After serving in the field of Public Child Welfare for 13 years ( 4 in private before that ) I chose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " for myself and my family . I think sometimes refueling is necessary to be able to continue to assist others in positive and helpful ways . I have also taken this time to study for my LSCW which I plan to take in March . You will do great TJ . There is nothing like being a social worker ... I ca n't wait to get back out in the field ! ! <p> I agree with everyone above ... it is challenging at times , and gut wrenching , but totally worth every second . I finished my BSW in 02 , and my MSW this past May . For 2 years , my son agonized as I worked full time thru the entire program ( yes , plus the internships , full time classes-papers , thesis , etc ... ) . oh , and I make more than 30k . ( Almost twice that actually ... ) and I really feel like I make a difference in some way EVERY DAY . It does make those two years beyond worth it . I too nearly quit my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but I had a great , supportive boyfriend who pushed me to " get it over with " and boy and I glad I did ! ! Honestly , hang in there .... there are so very few of us who can really do this job ( and hey , if you get bored , do something else ... its the beauty of a social work degree ! ! ) There is nothing in the world more rewarding than this field .... take heart in that . <p> T.J. , I just recieved my MSW in January 09 , while working full-time and taking care of a household . I will not say that it was not overwhelming but I wanted it so bad so I stayed focus . However , one thing you must to do while pursuing your MSW is to solicit family members for support . If you do n't  have famly members to support you ; reach out to colleagues and professors . In addition , you must take time out for yourself . Laugh a little , enjoy the roses , and most of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goal . OOOOOOOOOOOOh what a beautiful feeling to walk across the stage to accept my MSW at 51 y.o . Keep your chin high and keep pushing soon it will be over and you will come to the conclusion there is no greater feeling to succeed . <p> You guys are so fake . There is no way I will get a masters in social worker if I had to do it over again . Come on you guys , do n't mislead these young people . This feel good talk is all well and fine , but I would never advise my children to go to school for six years and earn the what I make . <p> I really believe for me it is a calling . I hushed it for many years and I do n't regret the work that I did in other fields . Fake ? I doubt that is the right word for what I am doing with my life these days . It would be a lot easier to ignore this call to service . I am passionate about this . I hope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get excited about . There is no greater feeling , in my opinion . All my best wishes to you , Anon ! <p> i 'm looking into sw. i HAVE a ba and want a msw degree . i already help troubled teens full time and unfortionately have my fair share of friends who were and are abused.my question would be a. can i support a large family as a social worker ( my wife makes 40k ) and b. if i can get the msw online , should i do it so i can keep up my social schedual for those that " need me " ... or the online degree is a BAD idea ? thanks <p> What are you going to do ? i 've often thought about leaving the profession , but I 've earned a license and feel stuck in this profession .

I have to admit I am bored out of my mind with these classes and feel as though this is nothing but a repeat of info from undergrad . My plan is to become an therapist and these classes are not geared clinically at all .

The " education " is really leftist indoctrination . Mind you , I 'm hispanic and very well acquainted with inner-city life . <p> I 'm considering dropping out , not because I do n't want to help people but because of the terrible " education " so far and thinking of being thousands of dollars in debt for a profession that typically does n't pay very well .

At the same time , it can be daunting to be in school and be in field 20 hours a week . The worst part of it is , negative feedback from people who say that you will never make any money as a social worker and you will be in debt forever and will never pay it back .

Ironically I rarely filled the entire 15 minutes with complaints , and she made this a great lesson to pass on . <p> MY 15-MINUTE RANT : <p> I am so tired of people saying that social work is a low-paying career ! I know many LCSWs who make six figures and I know others who do n't . I watch homeless people crawl under the bridges to sleep in my hometown , and many of my social worker friends have warm beds and blankets , high-tech phones , big-screen TVs , nice cars and great clothing . While some people must eat out of the garbage cans in the squares where I walk my dog , the social workers I know sometimes dine in fine restaurants , and are able to stock their refrigerators and cupboards and lunchboxes with healthy ( mostly ) foods . When I hear about people who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I will be enjoying state benefits in a few days . <p> When I was a " glamorous " magazine editor at a for-profit company , I made less money after 10 years than I will start out with at my social work job . As an editor I sat in a cubicle , and I will begin my career in a brand-new office . Whenever I asked to better my skills at the corporation , my requests were denied . The state paid for my entire Master 's degree , books , and travel because it wants to produce a better standard of child welfare workers . In exchange for that gift , I will give back while collecting a salary , and all the while learning how to be a competent social worker . I have to add the grant dollars I was given to my starting salary to look at the real picture , and I am grateful for this.I say this not to bash the publishing world , which I uphold as an honorable profession , but rather to make a comparison . <p> Some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in their lives and while in different positions-- and there was a wide range from $50,000--$200,000 . I can live with that , knowing I can accept more or less based on where my heart needs to be . And that 's why I chose this field , anyway ! <p> So the next time I am confronted by , or ( God forbid ) jump on the band wagon with , people who lament the " poor " pay that social workers receive , I will try to look at the big picture . <p> I love the idea of a 15 minute rant ! I think we need to get things off our chests sometimes - but then we need to move forward and be grateful and productive in working through barriers ! <p> However , I disagree about the salary of a social worker . I have been in the field for about 7 years and still make WELL below $50k . Infact , I still make below $40k . And I live in a very big city where the cost of living is pretty high . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 10k more in their FIRST year of teaching than I make now , MSW +5yrs . This is compounded by the fact that I ( and a number of my MSW friends ) are still single . <p> Now , I will admit that there are higher paying positions , but they are more administrative and farther away from the direct work with clients - which is the reason I wanted to be a social worker ! I will also conceed that I obviously am very wealthy compared to many , many , MANY people in this country and in the world at large . For that I am grateful ! <p> But overall , salary is a big reason that some people I know have HAD to leave social work as a profession . And I admit that I too am in a place where I may have to choose between my passion as a job and being able to have a secure life outside of work . It has crossed my mind more than once that I can not continue to live alone on this kind of salary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I wish my profession understood that as much as my heart is in this work - I ca n't work simply out of the goodness of my heart ! <p> I am so grateful for all the comments ! It really helps me to put things in perspective . All that I know on this day is that I am letting my heart lead me and I am counting on my head to guide me in the best direction . <p> Whether one believes I am under- or over-paid does not matter ; it matters what I think , as only I can take care of me in this personal way . <p> I have been a social worker for over 8 years and made good money working in SNF till NOW . Unemployed ( due to my husband relocating to find jobs due to the economy ) I do not feel the Social Work field is respected and I 'm tired of that . We need to have standardized credentials accross the US IMO anyway . Not that my opinion matters , the one post I saw I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I will go into Occupational Therapy if I can and make more money with a masters than a MSW.I have never met anyone at the MSW level that did n't work in Hospice and I made more then they did with a BSW . If you need a job and you have your MSW go to California they only have MSW jobs here , another reasons for my unemployement . I can not wait to go back to school.I wish I had known more prior to getting my BSW I would be better off if I had my OT than this degree . More work in every state I have lived in that field than in Social Work.Good Luck to all : ) <p> Totatally awesome post . Thanks so much . I 've been in Social Work for 4 years now and I So love it !

I know we do not get a lot of respect but neither do teachers or anyone else who 's heart is to help . I respect my profession by doing the best I can , always speaking highly of it , I capitalize Social Work whenever I use it in writing , I continue learning and growing and encouraging others that Life is Great and Social Workers aim to help you make it better . I was told in grad school that we are not here to save people we are here to help people save themselves . That was an awesome revelation for me and has saved me a lot of heartache and pain . Social Work is Great and I loooooooooove Loooooooooooove Loooooooooooove being a Social Worker . ! ! ! 8- ) <p> Do n't get me wrong , I do love my job ( even when I am totally frustrated with the bureacracy ) , but there is a difference between being " in it for the money " and wanting to make a decent wage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it can be frustrating when people that have two years college programs are being paid more than you and you have an MSW .

Organizing fundraisers , cut-a-thons , etc. that raise money for groups in need . The " by the way " counseling that takes place between the stylist and their clients on such topics as spousal abuse , domestic issues , empowerment , etc . Using the " strengths perspective " without even knowing what that was ! ! You would be surprised what people reveal to their stylist . <p> Yes ... I probably have made more $$ as a cosmetologist than I ever will as a social worker . I know I wo n't get tips ! LOL ! My population is Older Adults , and I get asked frequently ( even by other social work students ! ) ... " Why do you want to work with THEM ? Is n't it depressing " ? ! ? ( Answer : Because they are where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm lucky , I will arrive there myself . To me , it is not depressing , but inspirational , to work with my elders ) . My gratitude : In my opinion , the " real " work we do , no matter what we label it ( social worker , hairdresser , waitress , etc. ) , is when our intentions to serve others can happen , no matter where we are and whether or not we get paid for it . In a tangible world , however , we have mortgages , student loans , other bills , etc. which requires $$$ . This is where the subjective part comes in ... is there enough $$$ for you to still do your " real " work ? Of course it 's different for each of us . I feel blessed that I have a career path that will allow me to do both , serve others and get paid , which indeed is a wonderful thing ! <p> I for one would like for us to be paid a lot morePERIOD . The work we do is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pay the same " high " cost of attending college as everyone else . Why do we settle to be paid less because " some policy " states " social workers " do n't need to be paid more ? ! That 's like saying to a client who 's a Christian , " its okay to be poor , Jesus was poor . " <p> Those SW'ers who are studying to be policy makers MAKE A CHANGE IN HOW WE ARE PERCIEVED . Help us not be to be viewed as tyrants and home wreckers , but HELPERS with deep knowledge on how to get things done . <p> In the Health care field Nurses are doing many of our jobs . We need to take our positions back by showing what we know and stop accepting " less then ... money/jobs/attitudes ..... we are important and do make many differences in people 's lives and we do not have to be poor to do that !

The Nepalese people and the civil society , however , have sprung into action quickly , helping each other and demonstrating a strong sense of resilience .

@@100125737 @4325737/ <h> Empowerment Through Group Process <p> The decision to enter the field of social work was the result of many difficult years in my life . As an older non-traditional student , pursuing a career in social work would enable me to reach out to others in need . It was through the empowering process of a dedicated social worker that I was guided into this field of work . <p> The first three years of preparing for a career in social work are concentrated on defining what it means to be a generalist social worker . As students , we are required to take classes in psychology , human behavior , ethnic and minority relations , and research . It is a time when students learn and take to heart the Code of Ethics for social workers . In the last year , we are assigned to a field practicum and have the opportunity to implement the skills , knowledge and values important to social workers . <p> Senior year is a time of excitement . Graduation is close at hand , and now everything we have learned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point , one feels both excitement and apprehension . Utilizing everything that we have learned , and under the guidance of a field supervisor , we cautiously enter into the role of helping others . <h> My Placement <p> My placement involved working with families that were in need of basic parenting skills . As a facilitator of a parenting group , it was my responsibility to help educate these clients on appropriate ways to parent their children . The parents who attended this group were often mandated by the Division of Youth and Family Services or the legal system . The majority of parents attending group had temporally lost custody of their children . Their children had either been placed in foster care or were living with relatives . Each child 's removal was due to an assortment of reasons , which included neglect ; substance abuse ; or emotional , physical , and/or sexual abuse by a caregiver . As I began my work with the group , I frantically tried to remember what course discussed all of these issues . <p> Factors that contribute to the mistreatment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and lack of social support ( Gershater-Molko , Lutzker , &amp; Wesch , 2003 ) . Abused children are often robbed of their childhood and left with doubts as to whether life can be trusted . The typical neglectful parent is an isolated individual who has difficulty forming relationships or carrying on the routine tasks of everyday life ( Crosson-Tower , 2005 ) . Burdened with anger and sadness over unmet childhood needs , this parent finds it impossible to consistently recognize and meet the needs of his or her children ( Crosson-Tower , 2005 ) . Physical and sexual abuse of a child by a parent is also caused by interconnected groups of characteristics and events . When dealing with these types of abuse , social workers need to recognize that the characteristics of the parent , the interaction between the victim and the abuser , or the dynamics within the family give rise to an abusive situation , and the environment and the stressors present also play a role in abuse ( Crosson-Tower , 2005 ) . <h> The Group <p> The individuals in the group were predominantly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raise their children . Many of the women indicated they had either been in or continued to enter into abusive relationships . Group members often were receiving assistance for housing , food , and day care expenses . Members expressed on numerous occasions that they had also been the victims of abuse or neglect as children. - Some of the stories these young parents told were of childhood horrors of physical or sexual abuse at the hands of trusted caregivers . Many , as children , were left to babysit younger siblings when their parents worked . Now these individuals are faced with the challenge of raising their own children without basic parenting knowledge . After listening to the mothers in the group talk about their lives , it was obvious that these parents loved their children but were repeating what was done to them . <p> My role as facilitator was that of teacher and educator , providing different techniques for more appropriate parenting methods . The issues discussed in group encompassed safety , punishment versus discipline , self-care , and parenting styles . As part of the group @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and empathic attitude . Although some of the stories that I heard were horrific and difficult to understand , it was important that my attitude remain non-judgmental . My time spent with the group members proved to be a very rewarding experience . <p> As group members became more comfortable with each other , the process of mutual aid came to light . They were gradually able to share with each other the most painful of stories , and they came to depend upon their fellow members for support . As facilitator , it was at times necessary for me to refocus the group to the issues at hand . An invaluable tool that I used in working with the group was humor . Many of the clients felt these to be the darkest moments in their lives , and the ability to see them laugh and feel optimistic toward a better future reflected the amount of self-determination each client held . <p> There were times during group interaction when I chose to disclose small portions of my life . Revealing pieces of myself helped the group to connect with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always been in the area of child welfare . The parents present in this group were representative of the resiliency found in survivors of abuse . Many of them have beaten the odds and are recognizing that what they endured as children was wrong . By taking a look at their life experiences and hardships , they are working toward changing the lives of their children . <h> The Right Decision <p> At the end of one particular group meeting , a young woman in her early twenties stated that she had come to realize that she could depend upon herself . She did not need someone else to make her feel whole . She , all by herself , was sufficient . I do not know if it was something I said , a revelation she had on her own , or the reflection of another group member , but at that moment I knew the decision to be a social worker was the right decision .

I was intrigued by the content of the class and I thought I would do well in that area of social work when the time came for me to enter the field . I turned in several assignments that semester thinking I did great , so I was surprised and humbled when those assignments were returned and I saw all the red marks . There was a lot of room for improvement , and I was worried about how well I would do when I would actually have to put those skills to use .

@@100125813 @4325813/ <h> Salaries for New Social Workers <h> Spring 1996 , Vol. 3 , No. 1 <p> Ask almost any social worker , and they 'll tell you they 're not in it for the money . <p> Social workers continue to be relegated to a low pay status which devalues their work and short-changes their clients , say some experts . <p> According to recent surveys , social work salaries have not kept pace with inflation , and salaries remain low compared with other professions , even female-dominated helping professions . <p> Some child welfare workers in supervisory positions are paid less than meter readers , according to one survey . <p> According to a new survey by Howard University Professor Philip Schervish for the National Association of Social Workers ( NASW ) , the 1995 median social work salary of between $30,000 and $35,000--when adjusted for inflation--has increased in real dollars only slightly since 1961 . <p> In 1993 , the last time an NASW survey was done , that range was $25,000 to $29,000 , says Schervish . <p> " We 're not looking at any advancement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are basically stable . " <p> " I think there is still a question about how well the services of social workers are valued , " says Leila Carlson , executive director of the Iowa Chapter of NASW . <p> " There ' a tendency to think Anyone can do that type of work , ' " says social work professor Brenda McGowan at Columbia University in New York City . <p> The 1995 survey included 153,000 social workers around the country , most of them MSWs . <p> " Relative to inflation , we 're still losing ground , " says Schervish . " The increases we 're seeing are due to increased experience and cost-of-living adjustments . There has n't been the ratcheting of salaries that we saw in the nursing profession ten years ago . " <p> In both the NASW survey and one conducted by the Child Welfare League of America ( CWLA ) , social work salaries were compared to those of other professions . <p> The CWLA found , for example , that the median ( mid-point ) salary earned by supervisors of residential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ median salary of $35,724 for registered nurses , and $24,492 for meter readers . <p> Social workers in child welfare with master ' degrees fared better--the median salary for that group was $28,010--but that salary was still not comparable to registered nurses ' salaries . When social workers moved into administrative child welfare positions , they began to earn comparable salaries to psychologists and librarians . And CEOs of child welfare agencies even made more than salaried doctors and lawyers--but there were only 250 people reporting in these positions , compared to thousands in the lower level ones . <p> MSW social workers fared best in California in the CWLA survey , earning an average salary of $29,332 . <p> New York came in second , with an average MSW salary of $29,118 . Missouri child welfare workers with master ' degrees were paid the least , earning an average of $24,808 . <p> " Salaries tend to be higher in the western regions , and lower in the southern regions , " says Jennifer Boyd , a research associate at CWLA . <p> Another factor which might be affecting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ church-related agencies , which have less money to devote to salaries , says Carlson of the Iowa NASW Chapter . <p> Sue Hance , director of membership services for the California Chapter of NASW , says MSWs right out of grad school can expect to earn about $20,000 to $24,000 in outlying areas and smaller cities , while new MSWs in more urban areas such as San Francisco and Los Angeles earn about $30,000 . <p> By far the highest paid social workers were those in universities , business/industry , and private solo settings , according to the NASW survey . <p> Still , Schervish emphasizes that insurance benefits and other expenses cut a large chunk out of the earnings of private practitioners , who gross an average of $42,000 to $45,000 . <p> " Private practice is not the panacea that everyone thought it would be , " says Schervish . <p> Despite two decades of effort by the NASW to achieve pay equality , both the NASW and the CWLA surveys again found that pay equity remains elusive . Even though the NASW membership is overwhelmingly female , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ members were $2,500 to $5,000 more than those of female members . <p> Patrick Curis , director of research for CWLA , says men in executive social work positions in child welfare agencies make more than women , and that " women have n't made it into the positions where they are running the big agencies . " <p> Beyond the issue of gender inequity , Columbia Professor McGowan says social work salaries in New York are affected by a " declassification " of jobs , the practice of hiring less qualified people for positions previously reserved for MSWs . <p> Because there is always a ready supply of hirees with less experience and who demand less pay , such declassification results in an ample supply of qualified individuals , lowering demand for MSWs and perpetuating low pay for those social work positions . <p> As a result , " there is no shortage ( of social workers ) that would force up wages , " says McGowan . <p> A similar declassification of former master ' level social work positions is occurring in California , according to Hance of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work positions are being taken by individuals with certificates in marriage , family and child counseling , who come much cheaper than MSWs , says Hance . <p> McGowan said the lack of a licensing mandate in states like New York also drives down salaries , because it allows the market to be flooded with less qualified social workers . <p> According to Schervish , " Some of the public sector settings are under court order now to increase their percentage of degreed , professional social workers . " <p> For many social workers , coping with low salaries means moonlighting . The number of social workers earning income from supplemental employment nearly doubled between 1993 and 1995 , the NASW survey revealed . Nearly 30 percent of those surveyed in 1995 reported supplemental earnings beyond those of a regular full-time job , compared to 18 percent in 1993 . <p> Salary inequities have prompted the New York City Chapter of NASW to recommend a minimum salary for New York City social workers of $35,000 . <p> In addition , the Chapter ' Salary Task Force is working on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of social work and helping agency directors find ways to raise salaries . <p> The low salaries bode i 'll for the children who are served by the child welfare system , says Boyd , of CWLA . " Kids in need of great stability are not getting that stability , " she says , referring to high staff turnover rates . <p> Still , new students continue to enter schools of social work despite concerns about their earning power upon graduation . Maybe they see other rewards ahead and are willing to sacrifice the " big bucks " for professional satisfaction . <p> Or to join in the fight to be paid what they 're worth . <p> Jeann Linsley , CSW , is a social worker and free-lance writer in New York City .

To be honest , I wish this was the place where I inserted a chart or some wise words of wisdom or something , but thus far , I do n't  have the answers.What seems to be working for me though is observing more than speaking and thinking ahead about what personal information I 'm okay with sharing in a broader sense.This way , I do n't  feel caught off-guard when lunching with the staff or come off as rude by not allowing them to get to know me and I do n't  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take back.For example , I 've decided that I 'm open to sharing stories about my dog , but annoyances about my roommates need to stay in my head.Im open to discussing holiday memories of the casserole my relative always made , but I wont be sharing the stories of the annual argument between siblings . <p> As for professional time , I 've been working to get to really know my boss and to watch her in different situations.I watch the way she handles those who work for her and those she works for and I listen when she speaks about life and her philosophies on how to treat others.Those tell me a great deal about her and about whether she 's someone I can ask , without judgment , for guidance , which allows me to ask her before speaking to others without fear that she 'll use the opportunity to sabotage me , pretend to know when she does n't , or to steer me wrong , which is a wonderful trust to build with your supervisor ! <p> Thus far , I think I 've avoided saying too much but then , the day is n't over yet !

@@100125869 @4325869/ <h> Lunch Talk <p> Going out to lunch is an age-old tradition for professionals of all kinds , including social workers . Getting away from the office at lunchtime can be like a mini-vacation from a stressful day . But if you 're not careful , " doing lunch " can have its own detrimental effects . <p> When I was a social work graduate student , I was at a neighborhood restaurant one day with another student from my practicum agency . At the next table sat a group of lawyers from a nearby firm . Even though we were n't trying to eavesdrop , we could hear their conversation . They were talking about a client-a woman who was going through a messy divorce . As we listened in horror , we realized that the woman whose intimate life details we were hearing in public was one of our own agency ' counseling clients ! We were being exposed to this confidential information not as a result of our professional relationship with her , but as a result of another professional ' ( supposedly confidential ) knowledge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How could they risk talking about their ( our ) client at lunch ? <p> On the short walk back to our agency , with no one else in sight , I said something like , " I ca n't believe they said that about ( client ' first name ) ! " My fellow intern almost jumped down my throat for quietly whispering the client ' first name . She made me think , and I never forgot that . <p> Later in my career , I worked in a setting where the staff often " got away " by going out to lunch together . But instead of totally " getting away from it all , " some work talk occasionally slipped into the lunch conversation . I would cringe in my seat , and " shush " my co-workers , but this lunch talk was a habit that was not to be easily broken . They would talk quietly , using initials or first names . Maybe a question came to mind that could have waited until they were back at the office , but that might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ahead and ask it . But what if the client ' neighbor , employer , friend , or family member was sitting nearby ? Even if no one heard them who knew the client , they could have . If anyone overheard them at all , how did it make them feel about our type of agency and about seeking services they may have needed in the future ? Not to mention the fact that it ' just plain unethical and disrespectful . <p> More recently , I have experienced other kinds of lunch talk . One day , I was sitting with my husband in a restaurant , and a couple sat behind us in the next booth . I could hear him saying , " I loved her , but I loved you more , " confessing an affair , and explaining an arrest and other sordid details . This was much more than I ever wanted to know about these strangers whose faces I never even saw . <p> And then , a most disturbing instance of lunch talk-sitting in a cozy eatery where the tables are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you want separate checks or not-and you 're not even sitting at the same table . A man and a woman sat , talking about someone whose funeral I had attended only days earlier . Having heard what they said , my image of that person would be forever changed , and I knew things that were so private , I would never reveal them to anyone . <p> Should I have said something to these people-these lunch talkers ? Maybe , but I was in shock and denial , thinking I must have misunderstood what they said . But when they left , my lunch partner confirmed that I had heard correctly . <p> Over the years , my idea of what constitutes " lunch talk " has expanded . The term could be used to describe talk that is overheard at lunch , dinner , a baseball game , or even in one ' own home . <p> Imagine this conversation between your 10-year-old son and his classmates , the day after you receive a frantic phone call at home from a client : " Last night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She ' got lots of problems , like all of my Mom ' clients . " " Oh , really ? Who is Mrs. Jones ? " " I do n't know , but I think her son Jimmy is in 4th grade . " <p> Regardless of where you do your talking , if it concerns a client , confidentiality is a must . This is one area of the NASW Code of Ethics that is crystal clear . Section 1.07 ( c ) of the Code states , " Social workers should protect the confidentiality of all information obtained in the course of professional service , except for compelling professional reasons . " And in Section 1.07 ( i ) , the " lunch talk " issue is addressed specifically : " Social workers should not discuss confidential information in any setting unless privacy can be ensured . Social workers should not discuss confidential information in public or semipublic areas such as hallways , waiting rooms , elevators , and restaurants . " <p> So , yes , " do lunch .

Conversely , social work programs based in religiously affiliated colleges or universities might be reluctant to place field practicum students with agencies that appear to have values and practices differing from the theological basis of the university or college . Additionally , some schools of social work with very specific missions may be reluctant to partner with religious organizations , particularly if there is a sense that these agencies might be vastly different from the expressed mission of the school of social work 's program . <p> - - - With all this in mind , how does a student initiate a new placement site ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desire to have the perfect field placement . <p> Baseline Perspective <p> - - - The first priority is to gather information about the agency . Consider asking some critical questions . What do you know about the agency ? How long has the agency been in business ? Just because it is new to you , this does not necessarily mean that it is a new agency . Sometimes agencies change names or have personnel changes . To someone new in the social work community , the agency might appear to be brand new , but in reality , the agency may have a long history of services and programs . <p> - - - Who are the staff and what are their professional credentials ? Does the agency have social work staff , counseling staff , or a mix ? Is there a licensed social worker on staff who can provide weekly supervision to a social work field practicum student ? What is the agency 's mission ? What services and programs are available at the agency ? What are the client base and referral sources ? <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of information assist in knowing more about the agency , but it will provide a better picture about whether this is a truly viable option for a social work field placement . You may think that the agency would be a wonderful social work placement , but realistically it is important to consider the bigger picture . <p> School Perspective <p> - - - When you have gathered some baseline information about the agency and its clientele , then it is helpful to consult with the field practicum director at your school of social work . Gather your information about the agency , and schedule an appointment with the practicum director . <p> - - - More than likely , the field practicum director is already familiar with this agency . If it is an established agency that you have just learned about , the field practicum director may be able to provide additional information , including a rationale about why ( or why not ) a social work field placement would be appropriate . If this is a newly opened agency , the field practicum director may know some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ individuals may , in fact , be a graduate of your school of social work . Frequently , the social work community is very small . <p> - - - The field director will most likely address some pertinent issues with you , such as the following : Your school most likely has specific policies about how an agency becomes a partner in the field education of social work students . Your school probably has certain criteria , timelines , and deadlines for agencies to become approved sites for social work field practicum students . <p> - - - The ability to supervise social work students , licensed social work staff , or social work staff who have graduated from a social work program accredited by the Council on Social Work Education , are key elements for most agencies to be associated with schools of social work . In some instances , community agencies partner with a social worker from another agency or someone in private practice to provide weekly supervision time , while another person ( not a social worker ) does the actual day-to-day work with the social @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ director will consider whether the client- and service-base is broad enough to provide basic foundations or advanced education for a social work student . Are there practice areas that address human behavior , policy , individual work , neighborhood , family , community , networking , group work , just to name a few ? Is the agency narrow or broad in its scope of practice ? <p> - - - The stability of the agency will be of interest to the director of field placement . If the agency is very new , then the director will presume that agency personnel will be investing their time and energies in keeping it going , and getting it on a solid foundation . Agency personnel may not have the time or energy to invest in building a relationship with a school of social work . Additionally , if the agency is new , the practicum director will be concerned about whether the client base is large enough , varied enough , and stable enough to provide a comprehensive cross-section of social work field education experiences . <p> - - - The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ participating in one of the areas of research or practice of social work faculty within your school . Schools of social work frequently attempt to affiliate with agencies in the area of their faculty 's expertise . This has the additional benefit of having faculty familiar with the practice area , a potential research relationship , and having faculty who will serve as faculty liaisons with the agency . Also , the additional faculty support to establish a new placement may make it more plausible . If the agency is within an area of practice that faculty also have interest in , this helps to lighten the workload . <p> - - - The field director and you will make a decision for the next step " approaching the agency . Sometimes , field directors prefer to make the initial contact with a potential agency . If a faculty member 's area of expertise lies in the realm of the agency 's services , the field practicum director may want to ask that person to join in the negotiations . The school field director and faculty may or may not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the agency . <p> - - - Some schools of social work are very relaxed about approaching agencies about potential field placements . If this is the case , the school may be fine with you , as a student , approaching the agency . If your field director approves of you making the initial contact with the agency , then he or she needs to make sure that you have a clear understanding of the expectations placed on an agency providing social work field placement . If you end up initiating the first meeting with the agency , it is imperative for you to have a clear sense of what you can and can not address with the agency and how the school of social work will be following up with the agency . <p> - - - Be prepared for the meeting . It is helpful to provide information about how you learned about the agency and why you think it would be a wonderful place for a social work field practicum . You need to check in with the agency contact person , to learn what she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ social work as a field agency . The agency may have students from other allied fields , so addressing what is specific to a social work field practicum is warranted . <p> - - - The agency needs to have information about what to expect if it is to become a social work field agency . This includes the number of hours a week you would need to be there and information about the types of tasks and educational experiences the school would expect of a field practicum agency . <p> - - - Can you detect the agency director 's interest in providing a social work practicum site ? Is it extremely high ? Beginning a placement is extremely time consuming . The agency director needs to understand that this is a career investment for the student , and that having a field student is not merely a way to gain an extra employee or another set of ears for listening . To be successful , there needs to be a commitment and investment in the social work student 's education . <p> - - - It is important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as well as the need for a social worker who would provide weekly supervision . Some schools of social work have very strict and narrow definitions of weekly supervision . It is important for you to have addressed this with your school 's field director before meeting with the agency . <p> - - - Does the agency have the ability to sustain a placement for social work students over time ? Or is this just an interest of yours , and the agency ( or some personnel at the agency you know well ) has agreed to do it just this once for you ? If it 's unlikely that there will be another student for years , then this is not in anyone 's best interest . Schools of social work build partnership-sustaining placements , benefiting social work programs , agencies , and in turn , students .

Otherwise , it is like starting new each and every time ! <p> - - - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the agency that , as a student , you may not be the best fit for the agency .

Perhaps that is so . However , that camel may have an easier time with the needle than a financially struggling and desperate professional mental health practitioner would have keeping his or her clients ' interests foremost . Temptations to cut corners can be just too great . - - Recently , an author of a book on developing a successful mental health private practice suggested that Internet consultation ( a practice employed by many mental health professionals on difficult cases ) is an ethical issue not germane to a book on developing a private practice . Another explains anti-trust behavior of some practition-ers on the basis that therapists often disobey laws and professional standards with which they do n't agree . However , to view such behaviors as only an ethical issue and not one that concerns both ethics and business leaves unanswered questions .

Ken Pope in psychology and Fredric G. Reamer in social work , among others , have written prodigiously on ethical issues . There is also an almost equal number of books and articles dealing with building a successful private practice , written by authors such as Nick Cummings , Ofer Zur , and Walfish and Barnett , to name a few . However , it is as if the authors of these books are writing for totally different audiences . Ethics books tend to focus on ethical issues but rarely address business or financial matters . Business books rarely address the ethics of private practice . But truly successful practitioners need to have mastery of both ethics and business . They and/or their clients will suffer otherwise . <p> - - - Although a review of the ethics literature still suggests that sexual misconduct is one of the more frequent ethical or legal violations , most other books and articles identify @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . These violations can include but may not be limited to : client abandonment resulting from the client 's inability to pay , failure to obtain adequate consultation or practicing beyond one 's level of competence , double billing or billing the client for a service that should be part of the fee , and a host of activities that would come under the category of insurance fraud ( Caudill , 2004 ) . The reasons for such behaviors may be greed , poor training , altruism , civil disobedience , or economic desperation . <p> Greed <p> - - - Whenever there is misconduct and money changes hands , greed is the obvious possible explanation . However , whereas every profession has members who might succumb to greed , the mental health professions " particularly the helping professions of social work , psychology , and counseling " are not likely to attract many people prone to greed , since there are so many other ways of achieving far greater financial rewards than going through the long tedious expensive process of obtaining a master 's or Ph.D . degree , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of situations . In short , there are far easier ways to make a buck . <p> Poor Training in Ethics <p> - - - Inadequate training can be a factor . However , there seems to be no shortage of course content in ethics . In professional schools and in most disciplines , ethics courses are a part of continuing education requirements to maintain one 's license . Additionally , although many sections of ethical codes are general and open to interpretation , standards related to deception and fraud are quite explicit . For example , the NASW Code of Ethics , Section 4.04 : Dishonesty , Fraud , and Deception , says : Social workers should not participate in , condone , or be associated with dishonesty , fraud , or deception . That is about as explicit as it gets , and it should not take too much training to comprehend ( NASW , 1999 ) . <p> Altruism and/or Civil Disobedience <p> - - - Often , practitioners are relatively open and unabashed about engaging in insurance fraud . Some see it as a necessity to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insurance companies are seen in such a negative light , it is at times perceived as a form of civil disobedience to thwart what practitioners see as unfair , arbitrary , and capricious policies . However , as we shall see , such claims lack credibility . It is difficult to have people believe that you are being altruistic when you are making money on an activity that you would not otherwise . And with civil disobedience , the intention is to break the law publicly . Trying to get away with something is not civil disobedience . <p> Financial Desperation <p> - - - If greed , poor training , altruism , or civil disobedience can not explain some unethical or illegal behaviors by many otherwise reasonably decent law-abiding professionals , perhaps like most people who find themselves in a desperately difficult financial situation , their judgment becomes impaired . It 's not that they do n't know right from wrong ; it 's that they perceive themselves as having no choice .

A professional private practice is no exception . In a managed care environment where people expect to use their insurance , it is all the more difficult . In a recessed economy , a solo private practice may be even more difficult to maintain . <p> Examples <p> - - - Virtually all professional literature on ethics mentions the importance of practicing within one 's level of competence . If we encounter a patient whose problems are beyond our experience or training , we need to refer elsewhere or seek appropriate consultation . Few would disagree . However , as any struggling practitioner can attest , referring a patient out when you have empty hours in your schedule means a loss of income . It 's tempting to try to hold on . <p> - - - Taking on a patient who offers a new challenge is not necessarily a problem , if we also seek consultation from an appropriate expert or consultant . However , that may require an expenditure of funds , since many experts offering consultation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consultation by quid pro quo arrangements in which expertise is shared , but a solo practice usually has to budget for outside consultation . If a solo practitioner has failed to adequately budget for consultation , the temptation is strong to either do without or look for free consults . This may mean asking for favors from colleagues who may have no more expertise on a particular problem area than they do . Or , they may go to one or more of the many online discussion groups and ask for help from hundreds or thousands of other therapists on the Internet . In addition to the obvious informed consent and confidentiality issues , free Internet consultations are truly cases of the blind leading the blind , since no one can truly be sure that anyone is who he or she claims to be . It is no substitute for the real thing . <p> - - - Virtually every professional organization and ethics expert strongly cautions against obtaining consultation from people with questionable expertise on the Internet , Yet , such requests can be seen regularly on professional discussion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The question remains : Why would any therapist with a successful , thriving practice capable of paying for expert consultation take such foolhardy risks with a patient 's care and his or her license ? <p> - - - Ethical prohibitions regarding deception , dishonesty , and fraud could not be clearer . Yet , private practicing mental health professionals will often defend a number of their behaviors , including but not limited to up-coding or giving a more serious diagnosis to patients for insurance purposes , billing for telephone sessions as if they were face-to-face , and the routine waiving of co-payments , which might induce people to accept a service that they would refuse if they had to pay their share ( Caudill , 2002 ; see also Frager , 2008 ) . Collectively , these improper payments add up . In Medicare alone in one year ( 1998 ) , the amount of improper payment , possibly fraud , in mental health amounted to $185 million ( Medicare Office of Inspector General OIG , 2001 ) . <p> - - - The argument practitioners invariably give is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get help . Such arguments fall flat for at least two reasons . In each example above , the practitioners receive money from an insurer that they would not have received if they played by the rules . Second , if they were truly altruistic , they could have offered the service to the patient at a reduced rate or actually provided the service pro bono ( Riolo , 2007 ) . But one needs to be reasonably successful financially to give away services . <p> - - - Of course , the elephant in the proverbial room when considering the financial plight of the mental health private practitioner is managed care . The resentment that mental health professionals exhibit toward managed care is palpable and nearly universal . Low remuneration rates and loss of autonomy are among the reasons .

We join for any number of reasons , but most often it is because most of us would not otherwise be able to get enough private paying patients to make a living . But we can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Barnett , J. , Private Practice Principle Number 18 : Participation In A Managed Care Plan Is Not A Requirement ) . What we can not do , however , is join with fellow private practitioners to boycott a specific managed care panel . It is against federal anti-trust laws , and the penalties are steep ( Riolo , 2006 ) . Virtually all professional associations caution their members . However , every so often , after some managed care panel reduces rates , some practition-er will call for a boycott . Fortunately for the practitioners involved , these efforts usually go nowhere , which might explain why the government does n't bother taking action .

I would explain to parents that I wanted to support them and get support from them in assessing their child and ensuring that their child 's needs were being safely met . In discussing their child 's needs and safety , I would also explain that sometimes this would mean needing to make a report if there was suspicion of child maltreatment or abuse .

For a few families , it even allowed a dialogue to be opened up about past experiences in which reports had been made without their knowledge . It appeared that acknowledging past frustrations and being able to open up about previous experiences in which they were reported acted as a tool to break down some resistance in some of the families that I had been feeling . By being able to discuss the possibility of reporting as one of the realities of our work together , I felt that it helped to better align ourselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part , ended up going well with most of my families , and for some even served as a jumping off point for our work together . <h> Making a Report <p> - - - The first time I had to report one of my families , however , I felt anything but fine . As I mentioned , I had worked with families and children in different settings before , and I had made reports of suspected abuse or maltreatment while in these settings . However , these reports had been made confidentially without the family knowing I was the one making the report . I had never been in the position of making a report and openly discussing it with the parent . Discussing the hypothetical scenario of including the parent in the reporting process had sounded good in theory . In practice , it felt much more daunting. - <p> - - - A while back , a child came to me reporting that his head hurt . He said that his mom had hit him over the head . The nurse and I assessed his head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's report . I discussed the incident with my supervisor , and we both agreed that a report needed to be made . Because I had a relationship with his mom and because the child would be with us at school for the remainder of the day , we decided it would be all right for me to contact her before making the report . I had been working intensively with this family all year , and although there had never been suspected abuse prior to this , there had been concern about adequate supervision and confusion about reliability from both my client and his mother. - <p> - - - I was nervous as I made the call , but again , this was a mom with whom I had an established relationship . In making this call and including her in the process of reporting , I was doing what I said I would do when I began services with this family . I was upholding my word from our unofficial agreement that we had made when we began treatment . I was not na+ve in calling her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but I did think calling her first could allow the potential for our therapeutic relationship to be repaired and remain open. - <p> - - - When I explained the situation to the boy 's mother , she was upset and reported feeling frustrated that her son would make this claim . She reported that she had not hit her child and was adamant that the story was inaccurate . She went on to tell a very different story as to how her child had been injured . She said she believed her son was making the story up to get back at her for a previous incident. - <p> - - - I acknowledged her feelings and ensured that she was heard . I engaged her in a conversation and obtained information about her child 's well-being in the home . I then let her know that because of my position as a mandated reporter , and as we had discussed previously , I had to make a report . I emphasized that I would be sure to include in the report that I had spoken with her and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ angry , expressed this anger , and hung up . I then did as I am mandated to do . I made the report . <h> Reflections on Reporting <p> - - - The report was accepted , and as I hung up the phone , I felt a rush of mixed feelings . I felt guilty " extremely guilty " feeling as though I had betrayed a family with whom I had worked so hard to build a relationship . Within one claim and a report , I felt as though I had distanced myself from the family I was working with and felt forced to align with a system that does not always work in the favor of families . I felt nervous about what would happen next , both between my client and his mom , and between his mom and myself . I felt anxious , wondering if I had done the right thing and wondering if the call really was justified . I felt sad at the potential that the child 's report was accurate . How must he have felt in coming to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , wondering whose story was accurate , knowing that both the client and his mom had issues with accurate reporting . I also felt angry . A part of me was angry about being put in the position to make the call in the first place . And I felt angry that the family 's privacy was going to be invaded by a flawed system that is supposed to be supportive of the family but may end up hindering them. - <p> - - - Ultimately , the most comforting thought I had during this process was reminding myself that the object of a report is not to determine whether abuse or maltreatment has taken place . Rather , a report is made so Child Protective Services or local agencies can assess whether abuse or maltreatment has taken place ( New York State Mandated Reporter Resource Center , 2015 ) . Our job as mandated reporters is simply to report . They will assess and decide the rest . Even if I felt conflicted while making the report , I had done what I needed to do to protect my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ workers , we are often placed in difficult positions that many other professionals may avoid . We are asked to engage and to meet families where they are , while simultaneously holding the knowledge that if they disclose maltreatment , we will have to report it . It is an ambiguity and a reality that requires gentle treading. - <p> - - - Since this initial report , I have had to make other reports , and I have witnessed co-workers and co-interns having to make reports and being met with the challenge of how and when to include parents . It appears that each report ends up being and feeling different , but ultimately there are similar ambivalent emotions I recognize from my initial call . And I guess that is why I wanted to write on this topic. - <p> - - - When I made that first call , in my insecure state , I wanted to be assured that other people had felt this way when having to make a report on a family they worked with . And even now , in reflecting on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still would not have done it any other way . Had I chosen not to tell the mother that I was making the report , she could have easily deduced that it was me , creating even more distrust and resistance in our work . Ultimately , in collaborating with the mom in the reporting process , I feel that it will allow our therapeutic relationship to repair and rebuild in a way that may not have been possible had she not been told . Although more challenging and potentially uncomfortable , I feel it is the open and authentic way to continue to develop and maintain therapeutic relationships with families. - <h> References <p> Maggie Bender is an MSW graduate of NYU 's Silver School of Social Work .

In my work , I have experienced the most intense emotions in my life , both moments of deep sadness and intense joy . I have come face-to-face with secondary trauma and at times felt that I had reached my breaking point . Throughout this overwhelming journey , however , I have grown dramatically and have never been more satisfied both in my professional and personal life . <p> - - - - My journey with palliative social work began as a secondary role to my position as a hospice social worker . I graduated in 2012 with a BSW and shortly thereafter had the good luck to secure a position at a nonprofit hospice agency in California . After working in hospice for a year , our sister home care agency developed a palliative program , and I jumped at the opportunity to be part of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , because I was beginning an MSW program , and becoming a palliative social worker would act as both my employment-based internship and an extension of my passion for hospice and working with end-of-life issues . <p> - - - - Hospice care is end-of-life care for individuals who are no longer seeking curative or life-prolonging treatment such as chemotherapy , radiation , and experimental treatments . Palliative care , while similar to hospice , allows individuals to receive treatments that will prolong their lives , but these patients are often living with terminal illness . <p> - - - - My primary motivation for seeking the position , and what continues to motivate me to this day , is the reality that death and dying are extremely taboo topics . Therefore , many individuals do not receive adequate information regarding their end-of-life options . Current research indicates that a major barrier for a patient 's preference to die at home is poor communication between patients and their doctors ( Reese , 2013 ) . <p> - - - - Additionally , many individuals in our society do not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Do Not Resuscitate ( DNR ) orders for someone with a terminal illness , nor do enough individuals receive sufficient education on their rights to elect against pursuing treatment that may only be prolonging a painful dying process . As a palliative social worker , I have the opportunity to address this gap in care and provide the education so many people need when they are living with a terminal disease . Little did I know , however , the enormity of the challenge I was undertaking until I was in the thick of a near-emotional breakdown of my own . <h> The Challenges of Being a Palliative Social Worker- - - - - - <p> - - - - There is undoubtedly great reward in being a palliative social worker . It is a position that holds a great deal of responsibility , stress , and demand . Reflecting back on when I first began the MSW program and my new position , I realize now that I set enormously high expectations for myself . I saw a problem that I had every intention of fixing " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not happening adequately between terminally i 'll patients and their physicians . I took the task upon myself to help patients process the information that they were terminal . What an enormous job I had undertaken ! <p> - - - - Grief is something I have had to look squarely in the face in this position , and this was not initially a conscious decision . The stress of my placement and the emotional difficulty with palliative care has brought up a tremendous sense of empathy that has also brought a strong sense of grief . Although I had worked in hospice for the previous two years , there is a different sense of connection and purpose with palliative care . Being a hospice social worker means I take a journey with patients to their final days . I entered into it with a sense of optimism that may sound strange to many . It is a beautiful concept that individuals have the ability to remain at home with their friends and family and get the symptom management they need . <p> - - - - Palliative care , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ encounter individuals who are terminally i 'll , and everyone in their care network seems to know this except the patient . I am given the monumental task of gently broaching this subject with them . It often results in hours of processing shock , defeat , disbelief , and intense sadness for the patients and their families . It can take an enormous toll . <h> Self-Care and Finding Meaning as a Social Worker <p> - - - Through trial and error " and through great support from my instructors , field instructor , and my friends and family " I have developed a new skill set to deal with the stress of this position in a way that creates powerful meaning , and at the same time acknowledges my limitations . As a social worker , I push myself to have these tough discussions with patients , to help them process the information , and to prepare for the end of life . I must also continually confront and accept that every decision , including an individual 's willingness to have this conversation , is the individual 's decision @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I can and will continue to strive to give energy to every interaction I have with a patient , but I must also live with the fact that not every patient will want to hear what I have to say , and for good reason . These conversations are difficult , traumatic , and exhausting for any individual living with a terminal disease . We in the helping profession must do our due diligence to offer and provide education on services and self-advocacy , and to provide comfort for those in need . We must also acknowledge our own limitations . <p> - - - - We must have hope . I believe in having hope " just because an individual is near the end of life , this does not mean that life has ended at that moment when the doctor gives the earth-shattering news . There continue to be numerous opportunities for joy , laughter , closure , and meaningful change . It is my responsibility to try to impart the knowledge that this opportunity exists . We must have expectations for ourselves as social workers , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decisions , ultimately , are theirs and theirs alone , as it should be . <p> - - - The methods I have been using to manage stress and grief at work for the past few months have continued to develop and become more essential to me every day . The stress of my job , I 'm finding , can largely be controlled with good time management and the proper utilization of gaps between visits . I am making a point of planning my day proactively , so I am able to prepare for my cases the day before my visits , instead of the agency norm of doing it the day of the visit . As a result , I can arrive to work with either a fully-formed or mostly formed schedule . My mornings now have more space . I have more time to relax and breathe , and I have more opportunity to center myself before I get into the field . Although it may sound like a minor change , this has allowed me to be less stressed and more present with my patients . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reflect on the rewarding aspects of my position . <h> Reference <h> Additional Resources <p> Hard Choices for Loving People , by Hank LONG ... is a wonderful book that covers many aspects of the choices individuals have to make when dealing with a terminal disease . <p> Being Mortal , by LONG ... documentary depicts the difficulty many doctors have in having the conversation about chronic illness and death with their patients . <p> Andrew Smith received his master 's degree in social work from the California State University at Chico .

I was at a friends baby shower , and we were all recent college grads . The hostess asked me if I was working , and I told her I was a child protection social worker . She dissolved into tears as she described a story she had just read in the paper about a baby being abused by a parent . It was a terrible story , but she immediately associated me with that story and spent the rest of the shower tearfully telling me that she did n't  know how I could possibly do my job . <p> I 'm never sure how to take that comment , and I get it all the time . Sometimes its spoken with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you do your job ! " Other times , it comes across with a bit of a tone : " I could never do your job . " I understand that its usually meant as some type of compliment , but I also wonder if the unspoken question is , " What kind of person chooses to be around such misery every day ? " <p> There are other professions that involve varying degrees of sadness , stress , overwork , and worry , but they are usually viewed with more admiration . Oncologists , fire fighters , police officers , NICU nursesusually these people are admired and honored , and they are often portrayed in the media as noble , self-sacrificing warriors . <p> Social work is rarely portrayed in the media , but when it is , it is almost universally negative . Usually , the social worker is the cold and unfeeling . Oftentimes the " real hero " of the story tries to protect the child in question from " the system " out of fear that the child will get lost or abused even worse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> It is even more negative when there is a high profile child abuse case in the news . These cases are often the only time that child protection gets any media attention , and the story is usually about whether the system did enough . At worst , the stories attack and blame the local child protection agency for failing to protect the child . And because of data privacy laws , the local agency can say nothing more than , " no comment , " which in this day and age is often taken as an admission of guilt . <p> So back to the question : " How do you do your job ? " I can only speak for myself , but I have learned to accept the reality that sometimes Bad Things happen to kids . Its a truth that feels wrong to accept.For one , adults are supposed to be the protectors of children , and if we accept that child abuse happens , then does n't  it mean that the adults have failed ? Second , most people who hurt their children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a parent abuses a child , but it is rare that a parent hurts his child with no guilt , shame , or remorse.The vast majority of parents who hurt their children also love those same children dearly . It is a paradox that is hard to grasp in a black and white world . <p> The grimace that I get from people who ask about my job comes from not wanting to think about or hear about child abuse . And I get that completely . There are days that I do n't  want to think about it either . In our office , we talk about how nice it would be not to know what we know . I 'm guessing its that feeling that leads to the burnout that is common in the profession . <p> But to be honest , there 's not a lot of turnover at my agency , and that 's because we also laugh a lotnot at our clients expense , but we do laugh about almost everything else that comes with our jobsawkwardly observing urine drug testing , getting chased by mangy dogs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we can do is laugh . And many times , my clients and I laugh together . <p> So my usual answer to the question that brings a hush over the room is that I have learned to accept , to do the best I can , to be kind , and to laugh . <p> Kristin Johnson has worked for nearly 20 years at Goodhue County Social Services in Red Wing , MN.She has recently published a novel based in the child protection system called " unprotected . " Find more information at **25;309;TOOLONG . <p> A good start . I would add : --I believe that people are basically good but do hurtful things that make sense to them for some reason . Once we get to that I can help them. --Hope . I believe that change is possible and the most change can happen with the people who start at the lowest. --Professionalism . I do n't think of how bad the situation is , I think of what can be done about it . It 's hard to get depressed when you 're busy trying to make a difference .

That 's stressful &amp; it 's just not possible to carefully read every one . Remember , this person has a full-time job . Hiring staff is extra work in an already full work life . If you want to be considered , you have to stand out &amp; exhibit professionalism . So ... DOs &amp; DON'Ts : <p> -DO N'T copy/paste your resume into the body of an email OR rely on a job search website to organize your resume OR copy/paste your cover letter into the job search website . It looks sloppy , it will have to be either transferred to word processing or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the resume into a concise , reader friendly version . Either put the cover letter into the body of an email or attach both the cover letter &amp; resume as PDF files . But do n't send a blank email with only attachments . Write a brief note referencing your interest and your attachments . <p> -DO make sure your resume is updated . If your resume says you expect a degree in 2012 &amp; you 're applying for a job in 2015 , it tells the manager that you don't/ca n't pay attention to detail . That 's a red flag and it will land your resume squarely in the NO PILE . <p> -DO N'T call or drop by the office uninvited . The only exception is if you have a connection with the manager or company . Then call , but still do n't drop by the office . Again , the hiring manager has a full time job outside of hiring &amp; probably wo n't have time to see you . <p> -DO make yourself available . If you 're applying for work &amp; you get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to enter a subway tunnel or it 's otherwise not a good time , let it go to voicemail &amp; return the call when you 're available . <p> -DO , please , proofread . If you have poor grammar , incomplete sentences , &amp;/or misspelled words , you 're not inspiring any confidence in your abilities . We all know that a huge part of social work is documentation . Show that you can do it &amp; do it well . <p> -DO N'T apply multiple times for the same position . If you are n't organized enough to keep track of what you have and have not applied for , it 's unlikely you 'll be organized enough to manage a caseload . <p> -DO show up for an interview , on time , as scheduled . <p> -DO N'T cancel or reschedule due to inclement weather if the city is up and running just fine . This shows the hiring manager that you ca n't be trusted to show up for work . <p> Good luck ! Our field needs solid professionals .

I just wrote a book about movies ( check outAdoption at the Movies on Amazon ! ) , and I also write this column and maintain the website Adoption at the Movies . In general , this is a good thing . I see films that I might not have watched were it not for writing about them . Some of them turn out to be disappointing , and others are as good as I had hoped . Some are surprisingly touching , heartwarming , or powerful . This past year , I 've covered a few excellent films in this column " two that especially stand out to me as worth seeing are Zootopia and Kung Fu Panda 3 . To close my column for 2016 and open 2017 , I want to share three more of the films that surprised me with how good they were. - Along with Zootopia and Kung Fu Panda 3 , here are Addison Cooper 's Must-See Movies for Social Workers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <h> Queen of Katwe <p> - - - Queen of Katwe ( PG , 124 minutes ) . In a particularly low-SES region of Uganda , Nakku Harriet 's children must sell corn to earn enough money to pay rent and buy food . Nakku 's young children , including her daughter Phiona , are welcomed into a local chess ministry run by Robert Katende . Phiona and her siblings are shown how to play chess , given food , and shown love . Phiona finds that she has a strong aptitude for chess ; she quickly becomes the champion of the youth center , which allows her to travel to national and international competitions . <p> - - - The film captures a caring adult in action , and it also shows that , given opportunity , kids from difficult places can thrive .

The earliest memories of Urban Quint are set in an orphanage in Switzerland . His mother eventually sent from America for him . He grew up in America , became a teacher , had a family , and retired . His mother refused to tell him who his father was . After his mother passed , Urban and his son , filmmaker David Quint , travelled to Switzerland to try to uncover some answers about Urban 's history . Captured mostly with David 's camera phone , Father Unknown takes us to the orphanage where Urban lived as a child , and we are with him when he finds someone who might have some clues to Urban 's history . Father Unknown is a remarkable testament to the deep need many adoptees feel for their own histories . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and family . <p> - - - One of the things I love best about being a social worker is learning the stories of others .

Name three celebrities who have adopted a child in the last decade . <p> Easy , right ? I thought of Angelina , Madonna , and Nia Vardalos . I 'm not sure why Angelina came to mind and not Brad , but , well , now I 've thought of four . Why do we know this ? <p> Adoption stories are in our media ; their growing presence suggests a growing audience for stories about adoption . Filmmakers see it . In the last few years , adoption has been featured in Despicable Me , Kung Fu Panda 2 , Meet the Robinsons , The Odd Life of Timothy Green , Juno , What to Expect When Youre Expecting and Martian Child , among others . <p> In a somewhat cyclical relationship , film is formed by public consciousness and , in turn , forms public consciousness .

On my " Adoption at the Movies " Facebook page , my two most popular posts were shared over a hundred times each both of them were pictures with cute captions easily-digestible , quickly-absorbable pills of heartwarming happiness.People like that stuff . <p> Filmmakers are artists and business people ; they 're not social workers or unbiased chroniclers of history , and so films sometimes paint unrealistically polarized pictures , drawing from fears and hopes rather than reality . <p> Look at adoptions . Adoption is often shown as an uncomplicated process : In Despicable Me , villainous Gru adopts three girls after passing a very superficial screening interview.In Kung Fu Panda 2 , Po wanders into a noodle shop and is quickly adopted by Mr. Ping . Cornelius Robinson waited in an orphanage ; when the right family came along , they were able to just take him . In The Odd Life of Timothy Green , the kid just shoots up from the familys garden.Just like that . Simple , quick , painless paths to parenthood . That 's what prospective adoptive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Quick . Painless . <p> Some movies highlight fears that the process will be brutal . In Martian Child , the social workers monitoring Dennis adjustment to Davids home are intrusive , distant , and judgmental . The Greens undergo an interview with disinterested , scornful social workers . Its uncomfortable and frightening , but that 's what prospective adoptive parents often fear . Demanding , insensitive social workers . <p> And that 's just covering the process of adoption . Movies also touch on adoptee identity , birth family reunification , grief , loss , and infertility with varying degrees of accuracy . Movies are n't  the same thing as training . But they 're not all bad . here 's why : <p> Film provides an insight into public thought . Sure , adoptions are n't  actually as easy as movies make them look but people wish ( and maybe think ) that they are . Social workers are n't  generally as callous and officious as movies portray us but people fear ( and maybe think ) that we are . Movies provide some hints as to what your future clients might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than training videos . People watch , absorb , connect with , and remember movies . Even when movies are inaccurate in their portrayals of important issues , they can aid conversation . Social workers can use familiar stories to illustrate processes ( Juno found adoptive parents through an advertisement , met with them , processed her decision with friends and family , but ultimately made her own choice ) , orto introduce conversations on important topics ( Kung Fu Panda 2 portrays the painful effects of keeping an adoptees history a secret from them ) . Films can also help families process their own grief . Families often find it difficult to confront their grief about infertility , but films like What to Expect When Youre Expecting and The Odd Life of Timothy Green show characters struggle with the emotional impact of infertility . Some prospective adopters who have gone through infertility treatments might be able to talk about the feelings that a character might have had before they 're able to talk directly about their own experience . <p> Movies can help parents develop empathy for their kids . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wonders why his history was hidden from him , and might decide to be open with history to ensure that their child does n't  have that struggle . <p> Some movies get the important issues right . Timothy Green refuses to keep secrets . Mr. Ping eventually tells Po the history of his adoption . The infertile couple in What to Expect process their grief and move into what seems likely to be a healthy adoption .
