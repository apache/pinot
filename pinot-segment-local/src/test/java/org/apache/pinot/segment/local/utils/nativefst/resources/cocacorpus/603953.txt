There is a danger , however , of over complicating things . The erection of shell scheme will be covered by the shell scheme contractors assessment . If the activity on the stand is clearly without significant risk , a simple risk assessment is required . There is a need for the exhibitor to confirm that this is the case . Please CLICK HERE for Simple Risk assessment . <p> Please see the guidelines on how to complete a risk assessment and why you have to . The guidelines are very comprehensive and risk assessments are there to protect your own liability/insurance not for the Organisers . <p> Event Risk Assessment <p> The exhibitor must identify all significant risk . Significant risks are those which are reasonably foreseeable in terms of probability and severe enough in outcome to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Examples of common risks associated with any event or exhibition are as follows : <p> Slips , trips and falls on a level surface <p> Manual handling , lifting or moving of heavy/awkward loads <p> Injury from electric shock <p> Objects falling from height or loads falling from vehicles <p> Impact injury from moving vehicles <p> Outbreak of Legionnaires disease from a water feature <p> Food poisoning incident from temporary catering outlet <p> Fire and fire related incidents <p> Major incident and civil emergency <p> Excessive working hours <p> Stress <p> Alcohol and drug misuse related incidents <p> Steps to Risk Assessment <p> There are two key definitions which are an important part of the risk assessment vocabulary . <p> A hazard is something with the potential to cause harm ( injury loss or damage ) <p> A risk is the potential for harm to be realised . This is usually seen as a combination of likelihood and severity and which is detailed in step two below . <p> The key to risk assessment is recognising that whereas there are a great many things which are hazardous , it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not they are actually a risk . <p> The most widely accepted approach in the events industry is the three steps approach as follows : <p> Step 1 : Identify the Hazard and who could be harmed . <p> Step 2 : Develop Controls <p> Step 3 : Implement Controls <p> Step 1 : Identify the hazard and who could be harmed <p> This is the hardest part as it involves predicting everything that could reasonably foreseeably go wrong . <p> There are various approaches to this based on the type of hazard or the type of harm as follows : <p> Types of Harm <p> Hazards that cause injury , such as a broken bone <p> Hazards to health , such as noise <p> Type of Hazards <p> Physical e.g. a vehicle <p> Chemical e.g. carbon monoxide in exhaust fumes <p> Biological e.g. food poisoning <p> Ergonomic e.g. upper limb disorders from working at a keyboard <p> Psychosocial e.g. violence <p> It is important to consider the potential consequences and who could be harmed . For example with an electrical fault the consequences are both potential injury from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Controls <p> Having determined what the hazards are , and to what extent they pose a risk these now can be considered under the following headings : <p> Eliminate the risk at source . <p> Substitute for a safer method or product . <p> Reduce the risk in a quantifiable way . A good example is the prolific use of centre tapped earth transformers for temporary power ( the yellow boxes ) . This reduces the voltage risk from 230V to a safer 100V or below on the event floor . <p> Isolate from the hazard . <p> Control the risk . <p> Personal Protective Equipment ( PPE ) are items such as hard hat and safety shoes . They are only effective if something goes wrong . A hard hat is only of use if something falls on your head . It also only protects you and not the person next to you unless they are wearing one too . It is far better to prevent the object falling in the first place . <p> Discipline <p> An employer should do what is reasonable within the constraints of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This is not a license to do nothing on the basis that it is too expensive , but should be the result of careful consideration . The key word here is reasonable . <p> Step 3 : Implement Controls <p> This is the business of implementing controls on the event floor itself . It is worthwhile considering all the practical implications of control measures before they are put into place . <p> Fire Risk Assessment <p> Fire risk assessment is a very specific legal requirement for all European venues . <p> Typical aspects which would increase the fire risk would be : <p> Naked flame on stands ( candles or gel burners ) <p> Use of compressed or flammable gases on stands <p> Use of pyrotechnics , lasers and other stage effects <p> Cookery demonstrations <p> Exhibition of motor vehicles <p> Likelihood of illegal smoking in outfield areas or in built storage areas on stands <p> Due notice/warning will be issued in writing ONCE ONLY and if an Exhibitor continues to be in breach of a regulation after issue of a warning , Nexus Media Events Ltd will take all and any actions necessary

Virtualisation was once again the buzzword of the day , as illustrated by many of the sessions and demonstrations . <p> The Market Focus sessions opened with OIFs Nathan Tracy discussing the key to unlocking the benefits of Software Defined Networking ( SDN ) , a theme that continued into Deutsche Telekoms Matthias Gunkels subsequent presentation , in which he detailed the companys implementation strategy in the IP core . <p> The move towards virtualisation within the network has also formed a prominent part of many companies offerings at the exhibition . <p> Component manufacturer Lumentum made waves on Day 2 with its SDN optical whitebox platform . Supporting the construction of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cost requirements , the platform operates simply and scalably with open interfaces and is one of many solutions for virtualised networks on show at the exhibition . <p> The rest of Tuesdays Market Focus morning session concentrated on the agility of optical networks and packet optical transport , featuring Nokias Samuel Liu and Ciscos Wolfgang Fischer . The Market Focus has once again been a resounding success , with over 2,300 visitors over the two days of the show . <p> After lunch , the focus turned to the key topics surrounding the question of fibre access , with FTTH Council Europe opening proceedings with an overview of the current European market outlook . BTs Derek Nesset also gave his companys opinion on ultrafast access and there were presentations from LightCounting and Telefonica before Antonella Sanguineti , of Ericsson , rounded the afternoon off with a discussion on how the industry can prepare for the arrival of 5G . <p> It was also another day of world firsts , with big data specialists Inphi demonstrating the world 's first 64GBaud dual channel linear TIA/VGA amplifier .

The guidelines are very comprehensive and risk assessment are there to protect your own liability/insurance not for the Organisers . Any complex space only stand that does not submit a risk assessment , fire risk assessment and method statement will not be allowed to construct on-site . <p> Risk Assessment : Exhibitor Risk Assessment <p> Every exhibition stand is a miniature workplace and therefore needs a risk assessment . <p> Simple space only designs to either confirm that you have no significant risk or indicate how you intend to control it - please CLICK HERE for Safety File - simple risk assessment . The file needs completing with all information give , contact details , height and material details given . This is sufficient and does include the aspect of fire risk assessment . <p> For complex space only stands it is a little more complicated . You will have to produce risk assessment and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stands . You will also have to produce a fire risk assessment for the stand once it is in use . If you have any other activities on the stand , such as catering , this will also have to be covered by the risk assessment . Please CLICK HERE for the Safety File and Complex risk assessment form , which includes questions about the stand , contact details and fire risk assessment for completion . <p> The exhibitor must identify all significant risk . Significant risks are those which are reasonably foreseeable in terms of probability and severe enough in outcome to warrant consideration i.e. they are more than trivial . <p> Examples of common risks associated with any event or exhibition are as follows : <p> Multiple contractors working in a single workplace <p> Fall from working at heights and working on a live edge <p> Slips , trips and falls on a level surface <p> Manual handling , lifting or moving of heavy/awkward loads <p> Falls on stairs or escalators <p> Injury from electric shock <p> Objects falling from height or loads falling from vehicles <p> Impact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equipment e.g. circular saws <p> Hanging wires <p> Structural collapse of seating or an exhibition stand <p> Outbreak of Legionnaires disease from a water feature <p> Food poisoning incident from temporary catering outlet <p> Fire and fire related incidents <p> Major incident and civil emergency <p> Excessive working hours <p> Stress <p> Alcohol and drug misuse related incidents <p> 5 Steps to Risk Assessment <p> There are two key definitions which are an important part of the risk assessment vocabulary . <p> A hazard is something with the potential to cause harm ( injury loss or damage ) <p> A risk is the potential for harm to be realised . This is usually seen as a combination of likelihood and severity and which is detailed in step two below . <p> The key to risk assessment is recognising that whereas there are a great many things which are hazardous , it is the context in which they arise which dictates whether or not they are actually a risk . <p> The most widely accepted approach in the events industry is the five steps approach as follows : <p> Step 1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Step 2 : Assess the risk <p> Step 3 : Develop Controls <p> Step 4 : Implement Controls <p> Step 5 : Monitor and Review <p> Step 1 : Identify the hazard and who could be harmed <p> This is the hardest part as it involves predicting everything that could reasonably foreseeably go wrong . <p> There are various approaches to this based on the type of hazard or the type of harm as follows : <p> Types of Harm <p> Hazards that cause injury , such as a broken bone <p> Hazards to health , such as noise <p> Type of Hazards <p> Physical e.g. a vehicle <p> Chemical e.g. carbon monoxide in exhaust fumes <p> Biological e.g. food poisoning <p> Ergonomic e.g. upper limb disorders from working at a keyboard <p> Psychosocial e.g. violence <p> It is important to consider the potential consequences and who could be harmed . For example with an electrical fault the consequences are both potential injury from the shock or a fire . <p> Step 2 : Assess the Risk <p> This depends on the complexity of the operation . For simple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Low <p> Medium <p> High <p> Most event risk assessments require more detail . It is necessary to assess both the potential likelihood of an incident or accident and the potential severity if it does happen . A widely used format is shown below <p> LIKELIHOOD <p> SEVERITY <p> 1 . Very Unlikely <p> 1 . Minor/ First Aid <p> 2 . Unlikely <p> 2 . RIDDOR 3 -Day recoreded internally ; 7days reported <p> 3 . Likely <p> 3 . RIDDOR Major Injury <p> 4 . Very Likely <p> 4 . Death or very serious injury to one person <p> 5 . Almost Inevitable <p> 5 . Death or serious injury to many persons <p> The template shows that we assess risk both before and after controls are put into place . Before controls , we are assessing what would happen if there were no controls . It is important when considering severity to assess the most likely outcome . For example , consider a rigging operative falling from 3m onto concrete . The operative could be killed or they could get away with no injuries . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as a broken bone . <p> Step 3 : Develop Controls <p> Having determined what the hazards are , and to what extent they pose a risk these now can be considered under the following headings : <p> Eliminate the risk at source . There is a point at which any operation is simply too risky and you must consider this . An alternative is to find a different approach . A good example of eliminating risk at source is a mother grid . It eliminates the risk of riggers falling from height by lowering the rig to the floor and carrying out a fix and hoist . <p> Substitute for a safer method or product . A good example is the use of emulsion paints as a substitute for the more hazardous solvent paints in stand build , or at seated event substituting a glass bottle with a plastic bottle for drinks . <p> Reduce the risk in a quantifiable way . A good example is the prolific use of centre tapped earth transformers for temporary power ( the yellow boxes ) . This reduces the voltage risk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ event floor . <p> Isolate from the hazard . This is a common form of control at event build ups . Workers are isolated from the risk of falling objects when raising a lighting rig by taping off the area under the rig to prevent access . <p> Control the risk . All too often this is the start point in many poor risk assessments . Notice how far down the order this is . The most common form of control on the event floor is the use of security and floor management . Another example is an agreed safe system for the lowering of stand panels ( i.e. not just letting them fall ! ) <p> Personal Protective Equipment ( PPE ) are items such as hard hat and safety shoes . They are only effective if something goes wrong . A hard hat is only of use if something falls on your head .

All wavelengths were encoded using dual-polarisation quadrature phase-shift keying ( DP-QPSK ) with coherent detection now the standard modulation format for 100 Gbps transmission . To get to the higher bit rates , beyond 100Gbps , the researchers also used orthogonal frequency division multiplexing ( OFDM ) to encode each optical wavelength with multiple frequency sub-channels a technique borrowed from wireless systems , but being actively explored by a number of optical companies for higher-bit-rate transmission . <p> Since previous Tbps experiments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ focused on achieving long-distance transmission over existing networks .

Google will use the registration information to work out where demand is greatest , and connect up homes in those neighbourhoods first . <p> In that sense Google is taking a leaf straight out of the books of European fibre operators . Dutch operator Reggefiber , for instance , uses demand registration schemes for all of its projects , and will only start deployment when a threshold is reached . <p> Google also announced details of service packages and price . The most exciting part of the announcement is gigabit fibre at very competitive rates just $70 ( 57 ) per month for the internet-only package or $120 ( 97 ) per month for internet plus TV . It will also offer a " free " broadband service for customers willing to pay the $300 connection fee .

The company originally said its goal was " to experiment with new ways to help make Internet access better and faster for everyone " . It said that it would investigate test new ways to build fibre networks , and share the lessons learned with the world . And it promised to operate an open network , where customers had a choice of service provider . Well have to wait a little longer to see how Google plans to deliver on those promises . <p> The pre-registration phase closes on 9 September with construction to homes beginning soon after . Mastrangelo points out that it is still very early days : " Installation is going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to be rather impatient , with most not actually getting service until mid or late 2013 , " she said .

@@108685895 @4085895/ <p> The next generation of reconfigurable optical networks will require optical components vendors to develop a completely new set of building blocks , says JDSU . Speaking at the Market Focus forum at ECOC in Geneva last month , JDSU outlined its approach to what it terms " self aware networks " . <p> " We 're moving from a ' broadcast and select ' to a ' route and select ' architecture , and for ROADM networks that 's a pretty big deal , " said Brandon Collings , JDSU 's CTO for communications and commercial optical products . " These new networks require a full new set of optical components . We ca n't take what we have today , and that includes the WSS wavelength-selective switch . " <p> Optical companies have been talking about next-generation ROADMs for a number of years , of course . Carriers aspire to ROADM nodes that are colourless ( can use any wavelength without physical reconnection ) , directionless ( connect any port to any port in any direction ) , and contentionless ( non-blocking in the wavelength domain ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enable efficient use of spectrum by high-speed optical channels , the flexible grid . The " self aware network " is characterised by these four capabilities . <p> " All these functions can be delivered with existing technology but the solutions are expensive . Technical innovation is needed to provide a cost-effective solution , " said Daryl Inniss , lead analyst , optical components for Ovum , in a recent research note . <p> JDSU 's announcement indicates that components vendors are getting closer to delivering such products . JDSU had talked about and demonstrated a high-port-count 1x23 WSS in early 2010 , but now says it plans to release two 1x20 WSSs integrated into a single package in 2012 . Higher port-count devices increase the number of degrees supported at the node as well as the number of add-drop channels . Putting two devices into one package enables the " route and select " approach , where there is a WSS on the ingress of each direction rather than a power splitter ( as well as on the egress . <p> Using " route and select " with back-to-back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since there is a second chance to filter the signal , says Collings . The architecture also enables faster switching time and lower optical loss overall . The drawback is that every channel flowing through the device now experiences two filters . " We need to make the pass bands squarer and wider so that we can still cascade the same number of nodes , " he explained . <p> The WSS is just one part of the solution , however . Ovum 's Inniss notes that " widespread deployment of next-generation ROADMs is still a few years away because high-port-count WSSs are a partial solution to a broader problem . " <p> Aside from the WSS , JDSU is also developing the multicast switch ( MCS ) , which transports the add-drop channels in any direction in a colourless , non-blocking way . There are still two ideas on the table to produce a subsystem with acceptable losses : tunable filter and amplifier arrays to offset the losses of the MCS , or coherent detection , which has lower loss because the coherent receiver is tuned to pick out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says it is working on both . <p> Other vendors are making progress towards similar goals . In the run up to ECOC , both Capella and Finisar announced 1x20 WSS products . Finisar can claim to be the only vendor to offer software-definable grid spacings thanks to the liquid crystal-on-silicon technology inside although this is more desirable than essential as it will be some years before carriers deploy speeds beyond 100G in their networks . Finisar is exploring the idea of a programmable mux/demux device as an alternative to the MCS.
