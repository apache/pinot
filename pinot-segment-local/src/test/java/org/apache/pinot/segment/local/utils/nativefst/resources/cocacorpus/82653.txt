It determines when , how long , and how far the valves open and close in relation to the pistons . For every two revolutions of the crankshaft the camshaft rotates one revolution . On most overhead valve engines there are two main types of camshafts , either a flat tappet camshaft or a roller camshaft . Whether it 's your first time building an engine or you 're just looking for a performance upgrade , understanding camshaft specifications and design is a must . There are many numbers and terms used to describe the design of the camshaft and it 's important to know how these numbers will affect the performance of your engine . <p> Understanding Cam Design <p> Terminology <p> Base Circle <p> The base circle is the round portion of the cam lobe where the valve lash adjustments are made . A slight high spot on the base circle is called base circle runout . <p> Cam Lift <p> This is the maximum distance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rocker arm ratio will multiply the overall valve lift , this should not to be confused with valve lift . <p> Cam Profile <p> The cam profile is the actual shape of the camshaft lobe . A flat tappet camshaft is slightly more pointed on the nose of the lobe , while a roller lift camshaft has a more rounded profile on the nose of the lobe . <p> Degreeing the Camshaft <p> This is a process that synchronizes the camshaft with the crankshaft . For best engine performance , builders use a degree wheel to dial in this measurement . Most manufacturers will list the exact specifications for each cam on the cam card . <p> Duration <p> The length of time the valve is held off the valve seat from the cam lobe . This is measured in degrees of crankshaft rotation . <p> Duration at .050-inch Lift <p> This is the distance measured in degrees of crankshaft rotation from when the valve is open at .050-inches until it 's .050-inches from closing . <p> Gross Lift ( Valve Lift ) <p> Typically camshaft manufacturers list this measurement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arm ratio , usually 1.5:1 . For example , if your cam lobe lift is .319 and you 're using a 1.5:1 rocker arm ratio , you can take .319 x 1.5 , which is .479 inches of overall valve lift . <p> Lobe Separation Angle <p> This is the angle in degrees between the centerlines of the intake and exhaust lobes . A 112-degree lobe separation angle means that the peak opening points of the intake and exhaust lobes are 112 degrees apart . This measurement is another way of expressing valve overlap , which is the amount of time that both valves are open on the same cylinder . If the lobe separation angle were 0 degrees , both the intake and exhaust valve would open and close at the same time . Measurements typically range between 104 and 115 degrees . <p> The art of selecting a camshaft that performs right in your street rod may become easier with experience , but the choice is less of a guessing game once you have a few of the basics , found in this latest article from Speedway . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 
@@41235670 @1235670/ <h> U-Joint Selection and Design <p> The steering system is often designed late in the build process . In a lot of cases it 's best to mock up the steering when the engine and exhaust components are installed . Positioning the column , steering shafts , and u-joints early on with respect to the engine and steering box will ensure that you select the correct parts . Steep angles and limited space may require a little trial and error to achieve the correct geometry , but with a little ingenuity and careful measuring , it can be accomplished . <p> U-Joint Selection <p> In addition to our application charts , you will need to determine the spine size on your steering component . Whether it 's a rack and pinion , steering column or steering box , measure the outside diameter and count the number of splines . On some components there may be a flat spot or keyway on the shaft . In this case you can lay a straight edge across the top , or count half the diameter of the splines and double that number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a theoretical full circle . <p> Speedway 's Available U-joint Combinations : <p> Smooth bore on both ends <p> Smooth bore to splined or double D <p> Splined and/or double D on each end <p> U-Joint Angles <p> If a single u-joint is installed we recommended not surpassing a 35 degree angle . This can cause hard spots in steering or premature wear on the joint bearings . If the u-joint angle exceeds 35 degrees consider a double jointed u-joint like PN 910-3247 . <p> Shaft Support <p> Anytime the steering system has more than two universal joints installed , it 's recommended to use a steering shaft support , like PN 175-0757 . It 's best to install the support as close to the center joint as possible , or if one shaft is significantly longer than the other , it 's best to provide support to the longer shaft . <p> Double D Shaft <p> A double D shaft has two flats on the shaft that correspond to the female end of the u-joint . For example : the 3/4-inch measurement on a double D shaft is measured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the connection of the DD joint to the shaft , you can drill a dimple on the steering shaft for the set screw to clamp to .

@@41235671 @1235671/ <h> Cooling System Principles <p> The purpose of your cooling system is to allow the engine to warm up to the required operating temperature as rapidly as possible and continue to maintain that temperature under all driving conditions . The cooling system should be able to do this when ambient temperature is as low as -30F and as high as 110F . <p> The peak combustion temperatures on an engine cycle can range from 4000F to 6000F and average between 1200F and 1700F . Continued temperatures as high as this would damage or weaken engine parts if the heat were not removed . <p> In a conventional cooling system the coolant flows through the block first , through the heads , then after the thermostat opens , through the radiator . Low-temperature coolant leaves the radiator from the outlet and is then pumped back through the engine block where it absorbs heat and continues to re-circulate . <p> The coolant temperature will increase as much as 15*F as it passes through the engine , and then cools back down as it continues to cycle through the radiator . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minute per horsepower depending on your water pump and pulley ratio . <p> The Thermostat <p> The thermostat 's function is to control the minimum operating temperature of your engine . It 's typically designed as an encapsulated wax-based , plastic pellet heat sensor that will swell as heat increases . The temperature rating on the thermostat will indicate the temperature at which it should begin to open . Typically it 's fully open 20F higher than its rated temperature . For example : a thermostat rated at 180F is fully open at 200*F . <p> The Pressure Cap <p> The cooling system is pressurized in order to raise the boiling point of the coolant . The boiling point will increase by about 3F for each pound of increase in pressure . At atmospheric pressure , water will boil at 212F . Under 15psi , water will then boil at 257F . With the proper antifreeze/water mixture , the boiling point should exceed 270F when under 15psi of pressure . <p> The Recovery System <p> Excess pressure usually forces some coolant from the radiator through an overflow . Most systems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hold excess coolant when the system is hot . When the system cools , the pressure decreases and a partial vacuum forms . This vacuum will then pull the coolant from the overflow back into the cooling system , keeping the system full . <p> Speedy Tip <p> If you notice your radiator hose is collapsed when your engine cools , do n't assume the hose is bad . The collapsed hose may be a result of a defective radiator cap . A properly operating cap should draw coolant from the radiator overflow container back into the radiator and not form a vacuum in the system . We also suggest using a spring inside the lower radiator hose to prevent any chance of this happening . <p> Coolant Mixture <p> You can check for proper coolant mixture by using a coolant hydrometer , supplied at most any local auto parts stores . This will measure the density of the coolant , which in turn measures the boiling and freezing point of your coolant . The higher the density , the more concentration of antifreeze to water . <p> It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mix . That fact remains that distilled water may be at an advantage because it does not contain minerals . If the drinking water you mix with contains minerals , over enough time it can lead to deposit build-up that could prevent proper heat transfer . Speedway Motors offers a premium ready-to-use 50/50 antifreeze and de-ionized water blend from Afco , under part number 106100001 . <p> Coolant additives can also help improve cooling by lubricating and eliminating the possibility of bubbles or foaming . Additives like Red Line 's WaterWetter , part number 91015709 , have been dyno tested to substantially improve heat transfer and reduce the possibility of corrosion .

@@41235674 @1235674/ <h> What Size Carburetor Do I Need ? <p> We 've all heard the term - bigger is better . We know that more air and fuel equals more power . So why not buy the biggest carburetor out there if this is so ? Unfortunately too much carb is a common mistake made that can actually choke the overall performance of your engine . The right idea would be to proportion the carburetor to the engine 's volumetric potential ( breathing ability ) . The engine 's volumetric efficiency is a measurable value and with a correctly matched carburetor you will receive the best performance possible out of your engine . <p> Any ordinary stock engine will have a volumetric efficiency of about 80% . Most rebuilt street engines with average bolt-ons have a volumetric efficiency of about 85% , while race engines can range from 95% up to 110% . <p> Example : Using a 355 CID engine x 5,500 max rpm = 1,952,500 <p> Take 1,952,500 x .85 = 1,659,625 <p> Then 1,659,625 ++ 3456 = 480 CFM <p> Even with about a 10% cushion , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If you try this formula yourself , be honest with how much rpm the engine will see . You 'd be better off with a carb smaller than needed rather than something oversized that can lead to poor drivablility and performance . <p> Vacuum or Mechanical Secondaries ? <p> A vacuum secondary carburetor is usually most fuel efficient when its used on street driven cars that have automatic transmissions . Vacuum secondary carburetors have one accelerator pump and work off sensing the engine load , which progressively open the secondary butterflies as rpm increases . A mechanical secondary carb uses mechanical linkage to open the secondary butterflies and most also have dual accelerator pumps ( a.k.a. double pumper ) . Mechanical secondary carbs are best used on applications with more radical camshafts , high rpm racing situations , and manual transmissions. 75701 @qwx485701 <p> Sign me up 75702 @qwx485702 75702 @qwx485702

Speedy Bill 's entrepreneurial streak was established when he started his first business - a hauling service - at age 14 . <p> In 1952 , with a degree in education from Nebraska Wesleyan University , 22-year-old Bill decided to forego teaching and pursue his love of cars and racing by opening Speedway Motors , one of the Midwest 's first speed shops . The company opened in a tiny building at 2232 " O " Street , Lincoln 's main drag . Speedway Motors grew quickly , expanding into a 5,000 sq . ft. building near 17th and " N " streets in 1954 . <p> By the early ' 60s the company had also opened its own fiberglass manufacturing facility for making street rod and race car bodies and parts .

You have valuable electrical components , brake lines , fuel lines , etc. that need guarded from extreme heat . But in this article it 's our goal to look at the facts about exhaust wrap and determine whether it 's the right product for you . <p> There are two basic reasons people wrap their exhaust : most often it 's for radiant heat control , but in addition to this , there are slight performance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Titanium exhaust wrap , they are rated to drop under the hood temperatures up to 50% , which is significant considering the amount of space we typically have to work with . On the performance end , header wraps are designed to keep the heat inside the header and by containing heat , it increases exhaust gas temperatures . This increase in temperature helps with exhaust scavenging effects which raises exhaust speeds and lowers intake temperatures . <p> This all sounds great ! But , there is more to consider . You should always check with the individual manufacturer 's warranty policy before wrapping your headers or exhaust . Most warranties become void once the headers have been wrapped . The reason being : these products are designed to hold the extreme engine temperatures inside the header . By doing this , the cool air can not circulate around the header and when the pipes cool back down after running your engine it creates condensation inside the header . This can lead to corrosion build up , rust , and wear the headers prematurely . <p> Whether you 're looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to wrap your exhaust always check the recommended installation procedure from the manufacturer . For proper bonding , some wraps require you to coat the header before you install the wrap and some do not . As an alternative , if you 're looking for longevity , you might consider simply having your headers ceramic coated . The same basic principles apply to ceramic coatings which is retaining heat on the inside and reflecting heat on the outside . <p> Would n't it be nice to get the best of both worlds out of your headers ? Speedway Motors has solved that problem with our exclusive heat resistant Armor Hot Coating . Now you can keep that great look with longer life . <p> If you 're ready to get your street machine sounding as good as it looks , it 's important to know how each muffler will affect your sound and performance .

@@41235685 @1235685/ <h> Testing 2 and 3 Wire Speed Sensors <p> Testing either a 2 or 3 wire ( Hall Effect ) speed sensor is a relatively easy task , and one that can save you quite a bit of money in the long run . Your vehicle could start to act like it has a bad coil pack or throttle position sensor , and after testing those you may still come up empty handed . This is when you would want to test your 2 or 3 wire speed sensor , as faulty units can also cause these issues . Another reason to test your 2 or 3 wire speed sensor is of course , your speedometer is acting up or not working at all . <p> To explain how to test a 2 or 3 wire speed sensor , the guys at Autometer put together a couple videos that walk you through the produces for each . There really is not a large amount of tools needed for the test itself , and they are not specialized either . The tools needed for testing either a 2 or 3 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leads , and a drill . The 3 wire speed sensor is externally powered , so you will need a power source of some form . <p> First off is testing the 2 wire speed sensor . These sensors are self powered , meaning the revolutions inside the case generate the signal needed to create movement in the speedometer . They start out by attaching the red lead to the signal output and the ground lead ( black ) to the ground on the speed sensor . Since he is testing the 2 wire speed sensor while it is out of the vehicle , he breaks out the high powered drive device ( a drill ) to spin the sensor at the necessary RPM 's to generate a signal .

@@41235706 @1235706/ <h> Rotor Phasing <p> With the now widespread availability of easy to use self-learning EFI systems like the FAST Self Tuning Fuel Injection kit and the MSD Atomic EFI kits , proper phasing of your engine ignition system is key to freeing up the most available horsepower . Not sure what phasing is ? That 's okay , we will do our best to explain it and how it can benefit you and your vehicle . The main thing to remember here is that phasing is NOT the same as timing . To freshen up on timing , you can refer to this article on Timing a SBC 350 and Ford 302 . <p> Essentially , rotor phasing is the proper alignment of the tip of your rotor with the appropriate distributor cap terminal . Why this matters is simple : if the alignment is off , the spark generated will seek the path of least resistance to ground out . Sometimes this can result in the spark jumping to the housing of the distributor , or it could jump to the next terminal , both of which would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it could potentially jump terminals and ignite fuel in another cylinder , with catastrophic consequences . <p> So now that you know why phasing is so important , let 's look at how to properly phase your ignition system for maximum benefit shall we ? <p> You 'll get to bust out your drill for this one boys and girls , because to properly check phasing , you get to drill a hole in a cap so you can check rotor movement with the engine running . ( Hint , before you re-install the cap , put a little white paint on the rotor tip to help you see it better ) Grab your timing light and clip the inductive lead to the corresponding wire . Start it up and let it idle ; you should be able to use the light to see the rotor tip through the hole you drilled in the cap . You should also be able to see the position of the tip to the terminal when the spark arcs out . <p> There are a few things to note here on setting phasing courtesy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you have no vacuum advance , MSD suggests the rotor tip be aligned with the leading edge of the terminal when the spark jumps . <p> Second , vacuum advance systems affect rotor phasing . If you are utilizing vacuum advance , you should check phasing with the vacuum disconnected AND connected . On clockwise distributors , the rotor tip should be on the right of the terminal when spark occurs , provided the advance is disconnected and plugged . If it is connected , the tip should be to the left when spark is seen . On a counter-clockwise distributor , these positions will be reversed . <p> On points and pickup systems , you have to move the actual points or pickup plate . This involves either cutting or slotting of the mount holes to allow for adjustment . Sometimes that 's more than most will want to tackle . <p> On crank trigger systems , all you need to do is rotate the entire distributor housing until the tip is aligned properly . And lastly , when working on the phasing with electronic ignition systems and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ electronic retard to activate later in the ignition sequence , it will affect phasing as well . MSD says that in most instances , it should n't be enough of a change to affect the phasing greatly , but there are some occasions to watch , such as extremely high-horsepower or nitrous applications . <p> Or you could also go the easy route , and let the ECU do the work of automatically phasing the rotor with the MSD Digital E-Curve Distributor .

@@41235726 @1235726/ <h> Looking Beyond the Cooling System for Common Overheating Cures <p> The hardest part about keeping your gauges out of the red on a street rod usually happens after you start changing what the factory did . But wait , is n't the core of street rodding all about changing the factory design ? After V-8 engines get dropped in place of four and six cylinders , space becomes a premium and you 're left with figuring out how squeeze the biggest radiator you can fit into a crammed engine compartment . The struggle comes in when there 's no longer a standard guide to use " you become the engineer so to speak . But with the technology involved in today 's performance parts , there should n't be any reason we ca n't keep our rods running cool . There may not be a set-in-stone guide on how to keep every street rod cool , but there are some known good rules to go by when it comes to the cooling system . <p> One of the first things you can examine is : at what point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time or just when you 're in traffic ? The radiator must have air moving across it to carry away the heat , so if you 're on the highway and it stays cool , but at a traffic light it starts to overheat , the issue is usually related to airflow . The next questions you can ask are : do you have the proper cooling fan in place ? And are you using a fan shroud ? Consider the path of least resistance " the same is true with airflow . If you have a shroud in place to channel incoming air , it 's forced to travel through the radiator . <p> So what happens when you have already replaced the radiator , the water pump , and added a new cooling fan , but the car is still running hot ? If we look at the source , a stock engine produces about 42 BTU per horsepower and after performance upgrades even more . When a vehicle is overheating and you have new components in the cooling system , it 's time to start pointing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too much heat due to factors other than the cooling system . <p> Air/Fuel Mixtures <p> A proper air/fuel mixture will help your engine run cool and to its full potential . Most overheating issues related to air/fuel ratios are the result of a lean mixture , which causes the cylinders to run hotter . On most carbureted systems , fuel pressure typically ranges between 5 and 8psi at all speeds . It 's important to maintain that pressure under all load conditions , because if it drops off at higher rpms , you run the risk of going lean . As a general rule of thumb , most stock engines use roughly 14.1:1 to 13.4:1 air/fuel ratio at idle and slightly richer at high rpm . So having a quality fuel pump and a correctly tuned and jetted carburetor is a must for proper fuel efficiency . <p> There are a few ways you can check your air/fuel mixture . Many automotive shops use an exhaust gas analyzer , but not everyone has access to tools such as this . As an alternative there are several aftermarket manufacturers who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the exhaust . Or another way to gauge your fuel mixture is by examining your spark plugs for abnormal burn characteristics . <p> Ignition Timing <p> Considering the principles of ignition timing , if the spark occurs to soon or too late , the cylinders will run too hot and the engine can suffer from power loss . If the spark happens too soon , the engine fights against cylinder pressure which may cause a pinging problem . When the spark occurs too late it wo n't completely burn compression gasses which creates more heat that the cooling system has to dissipate . The optimum ignition spark timing will vary with engine speed , load , and air/fuel mixtures . And the correct ignition timing involves more than just setting the initial timing ; the amount and rate of the mechanical and vacuum advance curves are also very important to avoid overheating . This is because cylinder pressure is much higher at wide open throttle than at midrange . The lower the cylinder pressure is , the more time it takes to complete the combustion process . <p> Checking the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your engine . Without a thermostat the engine would have no way of regulating the minimum heat range . The bottom line is that the manufacturer designed our engines to run with them installed . Every engine has an optimal heat range to run efficiently , in general 190-F to 210-F . On most carbureted engines , a common thermostat used is a 180-F . <p> You can check the function of your thermostat a number of ways . One method is by letting the engine come up to operating temperature while feeling the upper radiator hose , once the thermostat starts to open , you should feel the hose start to take pressure and get hot . You can also use an infrared heat gun on the thermostat housing to observe the temperature change as the engine warms up . Some may even remove the thermostat and check its function in a pot of hot water with a cooking thermometer . <p> Water Pump and Pulleys <p> If a water pump is leaking it almost always means the pump has failed and needs replaced . Before you install a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spins freely and has minimal end play . If it 's a high performance engine , high flow water pumps have been proven to help with coolant flow . You should always use the correct size pulleys according to what was on the engine from the factory . It 's not recommended to install under-drive pulley kits on street driven vehicles . Undriving the cooling system ( spinning the water pump slower ) can lead to poor cooling performance . If you 're buying an aftermarket water pump be sure to pay attention to the direction of rotation . Some of the later style aluminum water pumps with a serpentine-belt drive system used a reverse rotation pump , which can lead to serious headaches if overlooked . <h> Related Articles <p> Jeff K. does n't just limit his tendencies to the classics .

@@41235731 @1235731/ <h> Mixing Radials and Bias-Ply <p> Everyone has that special voodoo that they do . From those special driving gloves , to making your significant other take off their shoes , to the fuzzy dice handed down from your grandpappy , we all have our little quirks that we think help our vehicles perform better . Sometimes you heard about it from a buddy over cards , sometimes someone at a show told you they heard it from their brothers ' sister 's third cousin twice removed . ( It 's happened . ) We are going to address one of those quirks right now . <p> What 's the big deal with mixing radial tires and bias-ply ? <p> The main difference between radials and bias-ply tires is in the construction . Radials are built with cords basically running at right angles compared to each other when compared to the tread pattern center , and have reinforcing belts of either cording or steel . Bias-ply tires are constructed using overlapping cords placed in a crisscross pattern of 30--40- . <p> Due to the respective construction , the bias @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ radial . The contact patch will be less , and in result you will not be able to transfer as much power to the ground . The tire is also less flexible when mounted , which provides for the major disadvantage of a bias tire , as more feedback is transferred back to the car on rough surfaces . <p> Radial tires will have more sidewall flex , allowing for more efficient transfer of power to the ground . Increased efficiency in power transfer means better fuel economy . Radials also last longer than their bias-ply counterparts , and are more resistant to punctures and tears . You will also reap the major benefit of the radial tire : better steering responsiveness . <p> What this means is that at highway speeds , the bias-ply tire will heat up and actually lose traction . While it is not recommended that you not mix radials and bias-ply tires on the same vehicle , some do in race applications . If you so choose , be certain that the radial tires are placed on the rear axle , and the bias-plys on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the front axle you will experience under-steer . Be aware that the difference in construction will make the tires react very differently , and result in the vehicle being very unstable . <p> In the end , we will leave you with one last bit of advice . Tires of different sizes , constructions , and wear history can and will affect the stability and handling of your vehicle , and potentially endanger you and those around you . We say do n't mix them . <p> Buying a new set of wheels for your car ? We can show you how to correctly measure your wheel bolt pattern and wheel backspacing .

Once the tank is dry , you can knock the surface rust down by using a section of chain and sliding it around inside the tank . Make sure once the chain comes out to rinse the tank clean again . After the tank dries , you can introduce a cleaner and prep agent to seal the remaining rust and also remove the remaining contaminants . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around , then dump that out . Then pour the rest of the bottle in , and spread that around much like you are rinsing the tank out , then dump it and allow the tank to dry for at least an hour before lining . <p> Lining the tank <p> To line the tank , tape over all the holes in the tank , except for the one you will pour the sealer in . Tanks less than 12 gallons can be done with 1 quart , but tanks larger than that will require additional sealer . After pouring in the sealer , tip the tank side to side and back and forth slowly , to ensure an even coating throughout the tank . Excess sealer can then be drained and placed into a container for reuse or disposal . It is recommended that you simply turn the tank to where the excess will drain out of an opening into a pan .

To learn more about Nomex , see DuPont 's video about Nomex Thermal Protection . <p> What is Proban or FRC ? <p> Proban or similar FRC materials are made by chemically treating the fabric to achieve the flame retardant properties . FRC treated fabrics will decompose after being subjected to heat to form a localized insulating char , which acts as a heat barrier to help protect the wearer .

@@41235762 @1235762/ <h> Fiberglass Preparation Tips <p> Congratulations ! You 've found the source for the finest fiberglass auto body parts on the planet ! Our entire line of fiberglass comes with a white gelcoat finish that is ready to scuff , sand , prime , and paint . The best trick to achieve a flawless paint job on any fiberglass panel begins with the prep work . By following a few basic steps , your Speedway fiberglass will fit well , be a snap to paint and last a lifetime . <p> Fitting and Trimming <p> A fiberglass part can take weeks to cure after it 's manufactured . If you follow what some of the experts say , the minimum curing time is usually around 48 hours , while others say fiberglass parts should cure for weeks . If you do n't install the part right away , be sure to clamp the piece to a frame or other rigid structure to avoid any warping or twisting . Do not hang fiberglass parts from the rafters or stack them in the attic . Gravity , excessive heat , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After the curing process is complete , you 'll want to check the body panels , fenders , doors , or any other components for proper fit . Aftermarket fiberglass bodies were never assembled at the factory , so you ca n't just assume the panels will fit perfectly . Sometimes they will need a little help and if you did n't assemble the parts before curing , do so before sanding and priming . Do n't just hang the doors and assume everything else will fit , some parts may simply fit better than others ? <p> Trimming the panels is not difficult and can be done with a grinding disc or cutoff wheel . Be sure to protect yourself , fiberglass is not something you want in or on your body . Wear eye protection and a mask so you do n't inhale the glass dust , and cover your skin with long pants , sleeves , and gloves . You can use shims to properly gap the fenders or fit the doors . Keep in mind that with the flexibility of fiberglass , shimming in one place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Once you 're satisfied with the fit , you 'll need to clean the body thoroughly to remove any surface contaminants like grease or mold releases . A good wax and grease remover or alcohol with clean rags or paper towels should be used initially to clean the panels . One issue with using a Scotchbrite pad with cleaners first , is that it tends to open up the pores in the gel coat and can allow some of the release agent to absorb into the fiberglass . Avoid cleaning like this since it can cause imperfections in the paint down the road . <p> When the panel is scuffed satisfactory , run over it an additional time with wax and grease remover or alcohol and wipe it down with clean paper towels to remove any final residue . Use wet paper towels and wipe the panel down in small sections at a time . Dry thoroughly with clean paper towels and note never to allow the cleaner to air dry as it will leave contaminants on the panel . <p> Sanding <p> Time to get sanding ! Before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supported , otherwise you run the risk of distorting the panel with pressure from the sanding block . One of the great things about fiberglass is the gelcoat finish , which acts like an initial guide coat . You 'll want to sand the part until the gelcoat is slightly dull in order to give it enough tooth to hold the primer . The gelcoat will show off any low spots in the panels by remaining glossy , while the surface around it will look dull . <p> Start by dry sanding with 220-240 grit production paper to thoroughly remove the glossy layer from the gelcoat . Any areas left glossy will not give the primer a tooth to bite into for adhesion . A warning about sanding the gelcoat : use caution to prevent sanding all the way through the gelcoat layer , which can open up pinholes in the fiberglass that can later show through the paint . <p> If the gel coat is sanded through and the strands of the glass show , this needs to be sealed with fiberglass resin or body filler . Corvette panel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Repairs such as these should always be sanded and blocked smooth before laying down your first coat of primer . Any major repairs or alterations usually require additional procedures to achieve professional results . <p> The primer used should be compatible with the top coats that you 're using . If you decide to use today 's modern base or clear coats , urethane primers should be used , which also applies to any single-stage top coats . Remember , you can always follow the recommended procedure from your local auto body supplier . The primer should be wet sanded with 400 grit paper or finer in order to mate with the top coats being used . Be sure to thoroughly dry and wipe down the surface with clean paper towels and do any additional cleaning with a final wash or wax and grease remover . <p> For a look at Speedway Motors ' fiberglass parts and accessoriesclick here . 75701 @qwx485701 <p> Sign me up 75702 @qwx485702 75702 @qwx485702

@@41235823 @1235823/ <h> Hot Rod Air Conditioning <p> Almost all automotive air conditioning systems work in the same way . The basic principle in the refrigeration cycle is known as latent heat vaporization , which is the process of a liquid changing into a vapor . Refrigerant ( Freon ) is circulated through the system by a compressor . For decades , A/C systems used refrigerant called CFC-12 , commonly referred to as R-12 . Then , starting in the early to mid 1990s , vehicle manufacturers all went to the standard HFC-134a ( R-134a ) because it 's less harmful to the atmosphere . Anytime you 're installing or diagnosing an A/C system , it 's very helpful to have a basic understanding of how the system operates . This guide can be used as a general overview on common street rod air conditioning principles . Let 's look at how the A/C system normally operates . <p> Regrigeration Flow <p> Think of the A/C system operating in a continuous loop that is split into a high-pressure side and low-pressure side at the compressor . Once the compressor clutch engages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ low-pressure refrigerant gas into a high-pressure gas . <p> The high-pressure gas flows out of the compressor into the condenser , which is usually located in front of the radiator . The purpose and function of the condenser is similar to the cooling system radiator , which removes heat from the high-pressure gas . <p> Inside the condenser , the high-pressure gas changes ( condenses ) to form a high pressure liquid as the heat from the refrigerant is released to the air . <p> The still-highly-pressurized liquid then flows into the receiver-drier , which contains a filter to remove any debris within the system as well as any moisture or impurities from the refrigerant . Any moisture combined with refrigerant can form a corrosive acid harmful to the system . <p> The purified liquid refrigerant flows through the A/C hoses into the cabin of the car , where it travels through a small orifice called the thermal expansion valve . When the high pressure of the liquid drops , it causes the refrigerant to vaporize . <p> The resulting fine mist is metered by the valve and flows into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The drop in pressure caused by the expansion valve or metering valve causes the refrigerant to vaporize as it moves into the evaporator , which absorbs heat in the process . <p> Air is blown through the evaporator by a blower motor which is also located inside the heater box . The air is then cooled as the heat is removed and transferred to the refrigerant and cool air travels into the passenger compartment . <p> Compressor <p> The basic function of the compressor is to circulate refrigerant throughout the A/C system . Most compressors use a piston-in-cylinder design with intake and discharge strokes that draw in , compress , and discharge refrigerant . The essential part to consider when purchasing a compressor is its capacity in relation to the rest of the system . Bigger is not necessarily better , in many cases running too large of a compressor can result in decreased cooling and component life due to excessive pressure . In almost all applications , an 8 to 9 cubic inch displacement compressor is enough to cool large passenger compartments efficiently . The most commonly used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The efficiency of the condenser is probably one of the most important aspects to the a/c system . Its performance will determine how well the A/C operates . Ideally you should try to use the largest and most efficient condenser that will fit under the hood . With custom applications like street rods , the amount of space will sometimes be limited and vary , so careful measuring is a must . Since space can be a premium on pre-1950s rods , a good high efficiency aluminum condenser can help make up the difference . Airflow is as important as size , you can install the biggest condenser that will fit , but it can only perform as well as the amount of airflow it receives . Always try to mount the condenser in front of the radiator with at least a 1/8-inch gap to prevent heat transfer from the radiator . <p> Receiver-drier <p> The job of the receiver-drier is to filter the refrigerant and remove any moisture or contaminants before it enters the evaporator . This ensures that only liquid refrigerant passes through expansion valve . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absorb moisture , so always be sure to leave the rubber caps installed until it 's ready to be connected . The drier is often mounted near the condenser , but it can be mounted near the firewall or anywhere in the system as long as it 's away from high heat sources . The drier will benefit from a steady supply of fresh air , which ensures that the liquid refrigerant does n't heat up and cause evaporation . The drier is flow sensitive and will always come marked with an inlet and outlet source . It should always be mounted vertically to separate any liquid refrigerant that passes through from the condenser . <p> Safety Switch <p> The function of the safety switch is simple : it works by opening and closing the electrical circuit to the compressor . As long as pressure in the high side line ( between the condenser and evaporator ) is within safe operating range , the safety switch will keep the electrical circuit closed . However , when pressures rise above or fall below safe levels , the switch opens the circuit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ switch is used for any vehicle with a mechanical fan and simply shuts down the compressor , but a trinary switch has an added feature . The trinary switch is used anytime there is an electric fan installed . When pressures start to rise , the trinary switch will engage the fan to bring additional air across the condenser to lower high side pressure . Both the trinary and binary safety switches can be mounted anywhere in the high pressure line between the condenser and the evaporator . Some may choose to mount the safety switch behind the dash near the evaporator to hide it from view for a clean appearance . Speedway also offers receiver-driers with a built in binary switch to make installation easy . <p> Evaporator Unit <p> The evaporator coil looks like a small radiator that 's housed in the heater box located inside the vehicle . It works to transfer heat from the air to the refrigerant flowing through it . Heat from the air causes the low-pressure liquid inside the evaporator to evaporate into a low-pressure gas . It 's often difficult to redesign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the evaporator can come into play when determining which unit to use . There are options available that combine the evaporator and heater core for space savings . There are two basic styles of evaporators : under dash and in-dash , and choosing one is usually less about looks and more about how much space is available . <p> Expansion Valve <p> The expansion valve is attached to the inlet of the evaporator and it controls the amount of refrigerant flow into the evaporator . It does this by controlling the flow of the refrigerant based on the temperature at the outlet of the evaporator , which is measured by a temperature-sensing bulb and tube . When the outlet of the evaporator is warm , the opening allows refrigerant to flow into the evaporator . As the temperature at the outlet of the evaporator decreases , the sensing bulb and tube cause the expansion valve to restrict the flow to the evaporator . <p> The art of selecting a camshaft that performs right in your street rod may become easier with experience , but the choice is less of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , found in this latest article from Speedway . 75701 @qwx485701 <p> Sign me up 75702 @qwx485702 75702 @qwx485702

@@41235836 @1235836/ <h> Brake Line DIY <p> Having solid connections throughout your brake system is important for obvious reasons . Brake lines transfer fluid under a lot of pressure , sometimes 1200-1400psi , and leaking connections will decrease the brake line pressure and allow air into the system , which causes a spongy or low brake pedal . So to begin , we 'll show you some tips on how to plumb your brake system , get familiar with the various types of automotive flares , and look at some of the tools needed to get the job done . <p> Getting Started <p> For those designing the brake system from scratch , there are a few things to consider before getting started : the size and material of the lines , and the fitting style you will use to connect them . To keep your build simple , it 's recommended to use the same size brake lines for both the front and rear brakes . We suggest 3/16-inch line for most applications , although some rodders use 1/4-inch line . Speedway Motors offers 3/16-inch line in both standard steel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To ensure your brake system remains leak-proof , it 's best to choose one type of fitting and use it throughout with the least number of splices and fittings possible . Be sure to ask your Speedway Motors representative if you are unsure of the style of fittings you need with the brake parts you are ordering . <p> When you start designing the layout and determining where to route your lines , most of your bends will come off the master cylinder and around the front and rear axle . To make this step easy , first take a piece of baling wire and bend it to the length and shape you need and then use it as a template to form the brake lines . Doing this step first will save you the time and headache of tedious trial and error work . <p> Common Types of Automotive Flares <p> In the automotive industry there are four main types of tubing flares : 45-degree double flare , 45-degree single flare , 37-degree single flare , and the bubble flare . The most common type of flare you 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ double flare . The double flare is used on high pressure circuits like the brake and clutch system . The tubing is folded over on itself , creating a thicker lip that makes a stronger seat surface for the flare nut to tighten against . A 45-degree single flare has the same 45-degree taper without the folded lip portion and it 's usually used for systems that require less fluid pressure like carbureted fuel lines . <p> A 37-degree single flare is typically used with stainless steel brake lines where AN-type fittings are needed . AN ( Army Navy ) fittings were a military standard and are now used on race cars and many street rods . By design , AN fittings can not be interchangeable with any other type of fitting . The last type of flare is most commonly referred to as the bubble flare , but can be referred to as ISO , DIN , or Metric-style flare . The bubble flare is usually found on European imports , and towards the late 1980 started becoming more popular on domestic applications . <p> Tools of the Trade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first step in making a smooth and even flare . Hack saws or cut off wheels leave burs or uneven edges , which is impossible to mold into a flare that will seal . Tools like Speedway 's tubing cutter are ideal for any brake or aluminum fuel line . <p> One tool you 've probably seen in almost every tool box is the wing nut-style flaring tool . These tools work great , they are compact and get the job done with ease , but if efficiency is something you 're after , you might consider the deluxe flaring tool . The wing nut flaring tools are available in 45-degree double , single , and 37-degree flare . For stainless steel tubing , Speedway offers a 37-degree ratcheting-style flaring tool that is the best we 've found for the money . <p> For the hobbyist or anyone working on the brake system frequently , the deluxe lever action flaring tool is by far the most efficient tool on the market .

Put a dab of oil on your cutting blade , this is a good way to ensure long life with your cutting tool . <p> In this photo , you will notice after making our cut , the tubing has compressed in on itself ( closing the hole ) unevenly which will not allow for an even flare . Before you flare the line , make sure you clean up the edges with a file . <p> You can take a cone file and carefully smooth-out any burs or uneven metal on the inside bore of the brake tubing .

It 's been the most sought-after V-8 engine among hot rodders and racing enthusiast since its debut in 1955 . Chevrolet 's first design started in the early 1950s , and in 1955 , the company released the 265 cubic inch , 162hp V-8 . Soon after , Chevy released the 283 in 1957 , followed by the very popular 327 in 1962 . Then in 1967 , Chevy had a big year with the release of the 302 and 350 engines . The 302 still used a 4-inch bore , but had a shorter 3-inch stroke like the 283 , affording a much higher-winding race engine . The 350 blocks used the same 4-inch bore as the 327s , except they increased the stroke to 3.480-inches . <p> Jumping even later in the 1960s , Chevy made major design changes to the block , crankshaft , and connecting rod areas , including a new large-journal crank with 2.10-inch rods and 2.45-inch mains , compression heights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bore and stroke combinations like the 307 .

@@41235875 @1235875/ <h> Ford And Chevy Options For Solid Axle - Spindle Solutions <p> Street rodders always seem to come back to the basics . After spending several decades adapting a variety of independent front suspensions to pre- ' 48 vehicles , rodders are again embracing solid-axle , buggy-spring front suspensions . The revival of the Gasser look even has straight axles being shoved under many ' 50s- and ' 60s-era street machines . <p> All of this new interest in old suspensions can generate a lot of questions from those just entering the hobby . Heck , it can even be confusing for those who have been around for years . One common conundrum is deciding which spindles to use on your early Ford-style front axle . Today 's rodder can scrounge for one of several styles of original Ford spindles or select from reproduction versions of the same . Another popular option is using reproduction 1949-54 Chevy-style spindles on a tube axle . Given such choices , the selection process can get a little puzzling . <p> We recently consulted the seasoned tech experts at Speedway Motors to help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rodders . Speedway manufactures both Ford- and Chevy-style spindles . Each style is made using a high-quality forging process and high nickel content steel , so they are exceptionally strong and durable . They are also manufactured with updated designs that make them superior to original components . <p> A Little History <p> In the early days of hot rodding , spindle choice was somewhat obvious " you put a Ford spindle on a Ford axle . But even then there was some mixing and matching to be done . One common swap was to use 1937-48 spindles on earlier axles . This allowed rodders to use the much better hydraulic drum brakes rather than mechanical drums . Later on , rodders learned to adapt F-100 truck brakes and larger Buick drum brakes to these spindles . <p> As street rodding evolved in the later- ' 60s and 1970s , a quest for better brakes led some rodders to adapt 1949-54 Chevy passenger car spindles to early Ford axles . The Chevy spindles had the advantage of using hubs that were separate from the brake drums . And since Corvettes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could remove the brake drum assembly from the Chevy hub and slip a Corvette disc brake rotor in its place . Then it was simply a matter of fabricating a caliper bracket out of flat plate and , Voila ! " you had disc brakes on your street rod ! <p> A Stronger Design <p> Chevy spindles offered additional benefits beyond disc brakes . Back in the ' 70s and ' 80s , they were much more plentiful in junkyards than early Ford pieces . And unlike Ford spindles , the Chevy pieces had separate bolt-on steering arms , making it easy to fabricate custom dropped arms for dropped axles . It also made it easier to flip the steering arms around and locate the tie rod in front of the axle , a common practice on T-buckets at the time . In a similar vein , rodders building straight-axle Gasser-style cars could mount the steering arms on the tops of the spindles , making it easier to connect a steering system on these jacked-up rides . <p> The Chevy spindle swap required a bit of work to pull off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out the kingpin boss on the axle to accept the larger Chevy kingpin and machine the ends since the Chevy kingpin was shorter . The Chevy spindles were also designed for a different kingpin inclination than Fords , so it was necessary to heat and bend the axle ends to get proper camber . To help avoid this work , many manufacturers began building tube axles specifically designed to accept Chevy spindles . <p> As time went on , other disc brake choices became available for Chevy spindles . One option employed Volvo parts . Others used later-model GM rotors and calipers , which required some machine work on the spindles . In fact , for many years Speedway Motors offered a machining service for customers who wanted to modify their original Chevy spindles to accept newer disc brakes . <p> Modern Options <p> Today , high-quality forged reproduction spindles like those from Speedway Motors offer rodders plenty of versatility without the need to scrounge for old parts or farm out expensive machine work . So if strength and availability are no longer issues , what criteria should you use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seeking an authentic nostalgic look will naturally gravitate toward Ford-style spindles . Speedway 's reproduction versions are the round-back , 1937-41 style , and are designed to use bolt-on steering arms for more versatility ( Speedway offers six different styles of arms ) . You can use them with drum brakes for a true period appearance , or select from several different styles of disc brake kits for improved modern braking . Ford-style spindles will almost always be your best choice when using an original Ford axle or aftermarket beam axle . <p> Chevy-style spindles are a great choice for a variety of applications using tube axles . A shorter , thicker axle stub makes it a stronger design than the Ford spindle , which is worth considering on larger , heavier street rods . Speedway Motors ' version of the spindle is built to direct mount common GM and Ford disc brake rotors , like part number 91031956 , without machine work or adapters . It also has improved kingpin geometry to work better with modern radial tires . Speedway offers two styles of steering arms for these spindles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as noted earlier , the arms can easily be mounted to the top or bottom of the spindle . This makes them a good choice for Gasser-style straight axle setups. 75701 @qwx485701 <p> Sign me up 75702 @qwx485702 75702 @qwx485702

Valve lash is defined as the mechanical clearance between the tip of the rocker arm and the valve stem tip . If there is too much valve clearance it will decrease the duration of lift , lead to excessive wear on valvetrain , and cause noise in the engine . Too tight and the valves can hang open causing poor performance and excessive wear on valvetrain components . There are several methods to setting valve lash , but if you follow the firing order of the engine , you 'll only need to rotate the cam one full turn ( 2 crankshaft rotations ) to complete this procedure . <p> Valve Lash Procedure <p> To get started , make sure the engine is cold . You can use timing tape on the balancer or very carefully measure and mark the balancer every 90 degrees to double @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apply a generous amount of high quality assembly lube like Isky Rev Lube or Red Line oil on all of the contact surfaces before starting . <p> With the valve covers off and spark plugs removed , rotate your engine to top dead center compression stroke on the number one cylinder . Do this by watching the movement of the lifters or rocker arms " the exhaust will open first , then the intake . As soon as the intake returns to its fully closed position you 've reached the compression stroke . <p> Now you can set the valve lash on both the intake and exhaust valve . Most hydraulic lift camshafts will require zero lash for the proper adjustment . The process will be the same whether you have stamped steel rockers or roller tip rockers . <p> To achieve zero lash , tighten down the rocker as you spin the push rod in your fingers , do this until you notice slight resistance as you spin the pushrod ( this is zero lash ) . You should also no longer have any lateral movement in the pushrod @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , tighten the rocker another 1/2 turn to set the optimum preload on the lifter , pushrod and rocker arm . <p> Move to the number two cylinder in the firing order and the intake valve should already be open . Then rotate the engine over another 90 degrees or 1/4 turn clockwise while watching the lifters to ensure you 're on the base circle of the camshaft lobe and repeat the adjustment procedure . <p> As you move through the firing order the intake valve should be open on each cylinder . Simply follow the procedure on each cylinder and be consistant as you tighten each rocker . <p> The art of selecting a camshaft that performs right in your street rod may become easier with experience , but the choice is less of a guessing game once you have a few of the basics , found in this latest article from Speedway . 75701 @qwx485701 <p> Sign me up 75702 @qwx485702 75702 @qwx485702

Brake lines are no big deal , just bend to fit and you 're good to go . What about all these different valves you hear about though ? There are four main types of valves you will see as you build your braking system . Using each of these valves in the correct manner is vital to the proper operation of your system . <p> Metering Valve <p> You will usually find this type of valve on a disc/drum setup . The way these valves work is by delaying the front calipers until there is between 75-135 psi in the lines , allowing the drums to actuate at roughly the same time . This promotes stability in the rear end and also extends front brake pad life . Metering valves will usually be found inline leading to the disc brakes . <p> Residual Check Valve <p> Just as the name implies , residual pressure valves will retain a small amount of pressure in the lines , usually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a disc brake setup to prevent backflow of the fluid and creating brake drag . The 10 lb. variation is used in drum applications to help counteract return spring tension in a drum style braking system . Click here for an installation diagram or here to shop all residual pressure valves . <p> Proportioning Valve <p> These valves control the actual pressure applied to the rear brakes . Since disc brakes need more hydraulic force to operate , these valves even out the load so that both operate as expected under heavy braking maneuvers . Some proportioning valves are adjustable ( via a knob ) so that the the front/rear pressure bias can be custom tuned to your vehicle , while others have a fixed bias ratio .

@@41235972 @1235972/ <h> Choosing a Camshaft <p> There are many variables that will affect how a camshaft will perform in your engine . Before you even start comparing numbers , it 's important to understand camshaft design at the fundamental level . Once you have a better understanding of how each number affects the performance of your engine , selecting the right camshaft becomes less of a guessing game and more of a knowledge based decision . <p> What kind of performance are you looking for ? <p> There 's no doubt whether it 's daily driven or street and strip , most hot rodders want their street machines to sound the part . Nothing beats the syncopated music of a choppy idle when you 're pulling up to a traffic light . It 's more of a side-effect that race engines sound like this because their needs rely on high rpm operation . To run at higher rpm their camshafts need to be ground with a higher lift and longer duration . More valve lift and duration will obviously increase rpm , but on a street car one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matched for the engine . The art of matching a camshaft may come easier with experience , but it all comes down to finding the right balance between performance and drivability . <p> Things to consider <p> Most street performance cams will range between .450 and .550-inches of lift . But as you climb up to more radical profiles , say .460-inches and up , you should also consider what your budget needs are for the project . To prevent coil bind , changes in clearance , or part failure , high lift camshafts will require an upgrade to the original valve springs , rocker arms and pushrods . If you have power brakes that require vacuum at idle , or a stock transmission and converter , a high lift cam probably wo n't perform the best for you . On a near to stock engine a camshaft around .450-inches of lift , 110 degrees of lobe separation and .218 duration at .050-inch lift should still give you a choppy idle while maintaining strong vacuum at idle . <p> The right camshaft involves much more than just matching valvetrain components @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vehicle is just as important . Most camshaft manufacturers will list the optimum rpm range on each camshaft . But as you 're matching the rpm range you should also consider what your intentions are for the car . The type of transmission and torque converter , the vehicle weight , compression ratio , tire size , and rear-end gear ratio will all affect the rpm characteristics .

It should come as no surprise being one of the most popular options among modern rodders and race enthusiasts to this day . Most of the original GM V-6 and V-8 models used an ignition coil inside the distributor cap , making it a one-piece ready-to-run distributor . HEI ignition systems are very dependable and offer great performance on a number of applications . The heart of any ignition system is the coil , battery voltage is supplied on the positive side , while the negative side is repeatedly pulsed to ground . When the negative lead is grounded , the primary ( low-voltage ) circuit is completed and a magnetic field is generated by the coil windings .

More specifically , heat kills the transmission fluid . <p> Most automatic transmissions will run effectively at a range of 170-175 degrees Fahrenheit . If the temps are maintained at that level , your fluid could last up to 100,000 miles . Unfortunately , if that temp increases by just 10 degrees , your fluid life could decrease by up to 50% . Most stock vehicles have some form or another of a cooler for the transmission fluid . There are several ways you can help this cooling process . <p> First , change the transmission filter . Even a filter that is slightly clogged will reduce the flow of fluid , resulting in higher friction , and friction builds heat . Next , consider changing the smooth transmission pan to a finned product , such as this one from Speedway Motors . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surface area that cool air passes by and in turn increase the cooling capacity of the pan . Derale offers a series of transmission cooling pans that incorporate built-in cooling tubes which flow cool air through the ATF . Combined with their 2-quart increased capacity and heat-dissipating coating , these pans can reduce fluid temperatures 20-50 degrees . Every little bit helps , right ? <p> If those are n't doing the trick to help , an auxiliary cooler may be the next best option . Speedway Motors offers several options for you to choose from , from a single pass inline unit to four pass and even six pass kits like one from Derale that comes complete with cooler , hose , brackets and mounting hardware . <p> If you intend to mount an inline cooler for your transmission , there are a couple things that you need to keep in mind .

Transmission lines are pressure lines , and without that barbed fitting you can blow a line off and drain your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it on the return side , after the factory cooler . This reduces the heat being introduced to the radiator , which is usually where the factory cooler is located . Lastly , location is also important . Please do n't bolt the cooler to your exhaust .

Try and locate the cooler where it will achieve maximum airflow . <p> Auxiliary coolers are usually rated in Gross Vehicle Weight , and this figure can be found on the Vehicle I 'd plate that is mounted to the door-jamb of most American vehicles .

For most carbureted fuel systems ( street/strip ) any off-the-shelf performance mechanical pump will handle an engine rated under 450hp just fine .

We decided that rather than hunt for all the different variables , we would do the work and have the majority of the questions answered for you . <p> Tug Of War <p> First , which is better ; Pusher-style fans or puller fans ? To answer this , it seems like the consensus is in favor of the pull style fans . Independent tests have shown that even with a pusher style fan mounted only 5/8 of an inch away from the face of the radiator , there is still a vast amount of air that escapes from around the skirt between the radiator and the fan blades . Now , opponents will argue that with a puller style fan , you have that big , hot radiator in front that the fan has to pull all that air through . That 's a logical argument , and in response , there is a reason that most of the classic cars of the day had puller style @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ run both a pull and a push fan , utilizing the OEM fan mounted on the water pump , and an auxiliary pusher style on the outside of the radiator .
