Naturally they live in a area that is more hard packed dry ground , than loose sand . So , we do n't suggest making the bedding too deep to limit the amount they might scoop up while chasing insects . You may see your skink sleeping behind a log with just his head buried in the sand and they seem to be fine with this . Give them plenty of hiding spots to choose from so they feel safe . This can be as simple as a piece of driftwood that is raised enough for them to go under or an actual reptile hide like Zillas bark bend . Give them several choices , especially if you keep more than one skink . <p> LIGHTING &amp; TEMPERATURESThese skinks come from a harsh environment and as such are quite hardy creatures .

The rest of the enclosure can be in the 78-82 range . At night , temps can drop to as low as 76 degrees . Use a good quality temperature gauge , like Zoo Meds digital temp gauge or Exo Terras Thermometer . The easiest way to increase the heat in your enclosure is with a Reptile basking bulb and/or an Exo terra or Zoo Med heat pad . <p> In addition to heat , Peter 's Banded Sand Skinks need UVB lighting to help them absorb calcium and to synthesize vitamin D3 .

They are nocturnal and will spend most of the day sleeping on a favorite perch , becoming active and hunting at night . <p> One adult can be housed in a minimum of a 18 " wide and at least 24 " tall glass enclosure . Exo Terra 's 18 " x 18 " x 24 " works well . They do require a lot of ventilation , similar to a chameleon . So you could also use a screened enclosure for this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 18 " x 36 " like Exo Terras sm xtall screen . <p> You will want to have plenty of foliage and vines/branches for your waxy to climb on and hide in . If you want to use live plants , here are some good non-toxic choices ; Ficus , Schefflera , Hibiscus and Pothos . Zoo Med eco earth or Zilla jungle mix work well with some sphagnum moss layered on top for substrate ( bedding ) . LIGHTING &amp; TEMPERATURESWaxy monkeys need a temperature gradient to thermoregulate and control their body temperature . This essentially means you need to provide a hot and a cool side to your enclosure . All the heat elements should be on one side and the other will be the cool side . This way your frog can move back and forth between the different temperatures depending on its needs . When you have a tall enclosure , your temp gradient will usually be top to bottom instead of side to side . <p> A basking area of 80-82 degrees should be provided . The rest of the enclosure can be in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as low as 70 degrees . Use a good quality temperature gauge , like Zoo Meds digital temp gauge or Exo Terras Thermometer to figure out the temperatures in your enclosure . The easiest way to increase the heat is with a Reptile heat bulb . <p> In addition to adding heat , waxy monkey tree frogs also need some UVB lighting to help in their absorption of calcium and synthesis of vitamin D3 . In the wild , much of the UVB lighting is filtered by the tree canopy . So you 'll want to use a 13 watt UVB Exo Terra 100 on top of a screen to help filter those UVB rays . <p> HUMIDITYAlways provide a nice sized water dish with fresh water . Change the water at least once a day . Because these frogs live high in the trees , they are exposed to wind and much drier conditions than you would expect for the rain forest . To prevent dehydration , they spread a waxy secretion all over their bodies . Try to attain a humidity of around 40-60% . Misting the enclosure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough moisture , but a nice humidity gauge can help you in this area . Hand misters are usually sufficient , but if you do n't care to remember to mist the cage , an automatic mister like the Exo Terra monsoon is a nice option . Exo Terra bowls or Flukers rock dish are nice naturalistic non-porous water bowls . Frogs drink by sitting in their water bowls and absorbing it through their skin . DO NOT used distilled water for the water bowl . Distilled water has no salts or minerals in it as such it messes with the frogs ability to regulate the water in it 's cells . A process called , osmotic regulation . Death can result from this as well . <p> FEEDINGFeed your waxy crickets 2-3 times a week . You may be able to get your frog to eat roaches , but many ignore " worm type " feeders . Make sure to supplement your frog 's insects 1-2 times a week with a calcium and vitamins supplement such as Repashy Calcium Plus or Zoo Med Reptivite with D3 . <p> TEMPERAMENTWhile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the day , they still are an impressive frog to keep . Waxy 's will tolerate a little bit of handling . Each individual has its own personality , however , most do not like it all that much . Excessive handling can stress your frog .

Like all reptiles , they are dependent on external thermoregulation to control their body temperature . This essentially means you need to provide a steady daytime temperature in the upper 80s , plus a warmer basking spot that does not exceed 87 degrees .

If things are too wet , your snake could develop skin infections . Live plants can help with humidity too . <p> Keep a non-porous water bowl in with your snake and make sure they always have clean water .

The best way is to look between the eye and the nostril ( the loreal scale ) . If there is one scale , you have a Colombian . If it has two scales , you have an Argentine . <p> HOUSING Tegus in the wild live in a variety of climates ranging from , the tropical rainforest to savannas . Tegus spend most of their time on or near the ground . So floor space is more important than height in your tegus enclosure . Colombian tegus grow fast and get pretty big . We recommend starting out a baby tegu in at least a 36 " x 18 " tank . Exo Terra 's Large or Zilla 's 40 breeder critter cage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can reach an adult size of 3 feet for males and somewhat smaller for females . When your tegu outgrows his baby tank , a zilla 90 gal breeder critter cage would serve nicely for an intermediate enclosure .

Tegus are strong and they like to dig . If you have the room , always go bigger . A good rule of thumb is that an enclosure should be at least 1 1/2 times the length of your tegu , including tail . Tegus are active and smart . Error on the side of more room not less , and then you and your tegu will be much happier . <p> All tegus like to dig so provide a deep loose substrate such as Zillas Jungle Mix .

The best bulbs are the mercury vapors such as Exo Terra 's Solar Glo bulbs , ZooMed 's Powersun , or Solar bright bulbs . These provide heat and UVB all in one bulb . You can also use separate basking ( heat ) bulb and UVB bulbs .

Hand misters can also work , but if you do n't care to remember to mist , an automatic mister like the Exo Terra monsoon is a nice option . <p> FEEDING Tegus are meat eaters but will need some fruits and veggies in their diet as well . Variety is important . Do n't always feed them the same things . Adults can be fed every other day . Young tegus are better fed every day .

You always want part of the tank to be cooler so your gecko can regulate its own body temperature by moving from one area to another . Usually with a tall tank , the hot part is near the top and the cooler section is towards the bottom . It 's OK if the temp drops to the low 70s at night . For adult geckos in the winter , the night temps can drop into the mid 60s . Also , temperatures above 86 degrees are not good for your gargoyle gecko . <p> HUMIDITYMisting the enclosure twice a day will usually provide enough moisture for your gargoyle geckos .

Start slow with a new pet and gradually increase the amount of time you hold it . Babies like to jump and they have little bursts of energy . To help calm a jumpy gargoyle gecko you can use your hands like a treadmill . When your little guy walks or jumps onto your hand , put the other one in front and repeat . The gecko will get tired and should calm down after a few minutes . After you do this a several times , your gargoyle gecko should feel more comfortable being handled .

They are tree dwellers , spending most of their time above ground . They are very well adapted to living in trees and can climb " like monkeys . " <p> They are an intermediate care reptile and will need a very large and tall custom enclosure when they are adults . Young Green Monitors can be kept in something like an Exo terra 18 " x 18 " x 36 " for about the 6 months of their life . <p> Note : You can not keep them from growing by housing them in a small cage .

We do n't recommend screen enclosures for monitors as it is very difficult to keep the humidity right . Adult Green Tree Monitors need an enclosure of no less than 4 ' wide 2 ' deep and 4 ' high . There are many suggestions online for making an enclosure . Green Trees do not understand glass very well and therefore they have a tendency to bang their nose on it and hurt themselves . As long as your enclosure is big enough , they usually stop when they learn the boundaries of the glass . If you have space , bigger is better . Designing an enclosure for your Green Tree Monitor can be fun . Add branches or structures for climbing on . They will also appreciate horizontal shelves or wide logs .

The dimensions for enclosures listed above are based on one animal . If you have two , increase the size . <p> LIGHTING &amp; TEMPERATURESGreen tree Monitors come from a tropical climate . They need a basking area and a cooler section within the enclosure so they can regulate their body temperature . All the heat elements should be located on one side and the other will be the cooler side . <p> A basking area of 95-100 degrees should be provided .

They need the whole environment to be warm , not just a small area like a hot rock . Green trees are especially adapted to basking , getting heat from above . <p> HUMIDITYAlways provide a nice sized water dish with fresh water . Remember to change the water once a day , especially since your monitor may use it as a bathroom spot . Also scrub the bowl at least once a week to keep bacteria slime from building up . <p> Maintain humidity around 80% .

Let it watch you put food in the enclosure . Talk to your pet , let it hear your voice . You can change the water , spot clean the enclosure , do busy work near the monitor . Read , work on computer , etc. , but do not pick it up or try to touch it at this time . Why ?

Captive bred chameleons are much better adapted to life with us humans . <p> In the wild , most veiled chameleons live in coastal mountain vegetation . Screened enclosures work best for veils as they need a lot of airflow . Stagnant air can lead to upper respiratory infections . Glass tanks can be used , but you need to go big and make sure there is plenty of airflow inside . One adult can be housed in a minimum of a 24 " wide and 36 " tall glass enclosure . Exo Terra 's 24 " x 18 " x 36 " works well . The smallest screened enclosure for an adult would be 18 " x 18 " x 36 " like Exo Terras sm xtall screened enclosure .

@@50772852 @4272852/ <h> HERMANN 'S TORTOISE - Caresheet 156953 @qwx566953 <p> The ideal pet enclosure is an outdoor pen ( during the warmer months ) with well-drained soil . The larger the area the better , with a minimum size of approximately 4'x 4 ' for an adult . <p> They love to climb and burrow , so the enclosure should be sturdy enough to keep the tortoise in . You want the walls a minimum of 18 " high and constructed from concrete , cinder blocks , wood , or other solid building material . You do n't want to allow the tortoises to see through the wall , otherwise they will continually try to escape . The wall should also be buried 10 " to 12 " below ground . Setting up the interior of the pen with mounds , rocks , logs , and other items can help not only provide shelter , but also keep it more interesting for your tortoise . If you live in an area with raccoons and other predators , the enclosure should be covered with some sort of frame and hardware cloth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enclosure with lots of space and ventilation . Most inside enclosures will be too small on their own . Tortoises love to roam . So make sure you take your Hermann out to walk in the yard or around your house . If using a glass enclosure , for an adult Hermann , make it as big as possible . A Zoo Med lowboy tank is a decent size for an adult . Allow the tortoise as much space and open air as you can . Custom built enclosures like Tortoise Tables are popular . At the very least , use a 50 gallon ( or preferably larger ) rubbermaid-type plastic tub or plastic kid pool ( as long as it is tall enough for him not to climb out ) . For a baby tortoise you can start with a Exo Terra 18 " x 18 " x 12 " enclosure . They will out grow this usually by the time they are a year old . <p> Because they like to burrow , a good substrate mixture of Zoo Med eco earth and Exo Terra sand is recommended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adults . Keep it clean and a little moist . Take care that it 's not so wet that if you take a handful of substrate and squeeze it water comes out . Hermann Tortoises are susceptible to respiratory and other disorders if they 're kept in damp environments . As with outdoor enclosures , your indoor pet will appreciate rocks , branches , plants and other structures to hide behind and keep their interest . <p> Since even smaller tortoises roam large amounts of land , they always like to be busy and explore . Whether you keep them in glass or something they ca n't see out of they will still go into the corner of the enclosure and dig . <p> LIGHTING &amp; TEMPERATURESFor adults , you 'll want to keep your enclosure temperature in the mid 70s with night time temperatures can go down to 65 degrees .

Use a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gauge or Exo Terras Thermometer to figure out the temperatures in your enclosure . They will need a UVB light to help properly process calcium and to synthesize vitamin D3 . Since they are not out in natural sunlight in our homes , we must provide UVB light in the form of a special fluorescent bulb designed to produce UVB rays . The best bulbs are the mercury vapors such as Exo Terra 's Solar Glo bulbs , ZooMed 's Powersun , or Solar bright bulbs . These bulbs provide heat and UVB all in one bulb . You can also use separate basking ( heat ) bulb and UVB bulbs . If you use these , you will want the Zoo Med 10.0 or Exo Terra UVB 150 variety . ( If you do n't have a screen over your tank ( and it is not a really tall tank ) , you can use a 5.0 bulb instead . <p> HUMIDITYAlthough the Hermann 's Tortoise comes from an semi-arid region , they still need clean water daily .

Exo Terra bowls or Flukers rock dish are nice naturalistic non-porous water bowls . Babies need higher moisture . If you start with a baby , mist the bedding once a day . So they can get some moisture when they burrow and sleep . We also suggest soaking your baby tortoise a couple times a day in a shallow bowl of lukewarm water . Water depth should be just up to their knees for approx. 15 mins . to help them stay hydrated . You can also provide a humid hide . Just put a hide on the cool side with some damp sphagnum moss in it . <p> FEEDINGHermann 's Tortoises are herbivores and require a plant-based , calcium-rich diet .

They can be burned badly on a heat rock because they do n't realize it 's too hot until too late . <p> HUMIDITY Always provide a nice sized water dish with fresh water .

Do n't freak out . Water dragons have been known to hold their breath for up to 25 minutes . Remember to change the water once a day , especially since your dragon may use it as a bathroom spot . Also scrub the bowl at least once a week to keep bacteria slime from building up . <p> Maintain humidity around 80% . Unless you are in a very dry area , misting the enclosure a few times a day will usually provide enough moisture . A nice humidity gauge can help you in this area . Hand misters are usually sufficient , but if you do n't want to hand mist , an automatic mister like the Exo Terra monsoon or Zoo meds reptifogger are a nice options .

Most dragons really like the water . <p> FEEDINGWater dragons are mostly insectivores and should eat everyday . If your adult has good body weight , you can possibly feed every other day . Variety is important . Do n't feed them the same things each day . They can get bored and picky if you do . Mix it up . They can eat crickets , dubia roaches , mealworms , hornworms , and other bugs . They will also eat fish and rodents ( not more than once a week for these ) . Some will also eat some greens and fruits . <p> TEMPERAMENTWater dragons are intelligent , and can make great pets . However , they are not for everyone . Baby water dragons usually do not bite , but excessive handling should be avoided until your dragon gets used to you . Your first impulse will be to hold your new dragon and pet it . We strongly suggest you do not do this . It takes time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be patient and proceed slowly . <p> HOW TO TRAIN YOUR DRAGONPlace your dragons enclosure in an area where it can see you moving about . Let it watch you put food in the enclosure . Talk to your dragon , let it hear your voice . You can change the water , spot clean the enclosure , do busy work near the dragon . Read , work on computer , etc. , but do not pick it up or try to touch it at this time . Why ? You are letting the dragon get used to you , your movements and your voice in a nonthreatening manner . Water dragons are curious animals , and once they get used to you , they will start staying out rather than hiding when you are around . That 's the first step . <p> Water dragons are very food oriented , and if they see you as the food giver , they will start to trust you sooner . Once they get over their nervousness , they will be bolder and soon will start to come to you when you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your hand or arm when you are reaching in the enclosure to do something . Success ! Now is the time to start interacting more with it . Let it stay on your arm , talk to it , gently try to pet it on the back or side . Remember , let your lizard come to you . Eventually , your dragon will trust you and coming running when you approach to the enclosure . This is the time when you can finally start holding your pet . <p> Have patience . In some cases , this taming process can take months . Remember , your dragon can live 10-15 years so this part is truly worth the effort . You will be so happy when you are walking around the house with a happy and trusting water dragon riding your shoulder or on top of your head . Think of your adult dragon coming over to you for some petting time . It 's up to you to help make this happen . They take some work and are not immediately tame like a bearded dragon , but they are worth the extra effort .

@@50772993 @4272993/ <h> GREEN TREE PYTHON Caresheet <p> You will find many ways on the internet , on " how to " take care of this animal . This care sheet is showing the way we found works best for us from our many years of experience of caring for this species . <p> Green tree pythons may be referred to , by enthusiasts , as " chondros , " which comes from their former genus name , Chondropython . Green trees start off life as yellow and red and gradually change to green . Some will keep their yellow juvenile colors . Captive bred green trees are readily available and are a better choice than wild caught . They are generally healthier and have not gone through the stress of being shipped across the globe . <p> HOUSINGThe nice thing about green trees pythons is that they do n't feel the need to hide . As the name suggests , they 're arboreal . The enclosure should contain sturdy branches and/or perches set at different heights to provide an enriching environment for your python . The snake will rest coiled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cage at night . Babies can start out in cubes as small as 1 foot , like Exo terras 12 " x 12 " x 12 " . As adults , they will need a enclosure at least 24 " x 18 " x 24 " or larger . They do n't require tall cages . A 2 foot high enclosure will work fine , but it should be 2 or 3 feet wide because in the wild , they like to move horizontally through the trees . <p> LIGHTING AND HEATGreen trees originate from the rainforest , and they need it fairly humid . Like all reptiles , they are dependent on external thermoregulation to control their body temperature . This essentially means you need to provide a hot and a cool side to your enclosure . All the heat elements should be on one side and the other will then be the cool side . This way your green tree can move back and forth between the different temperatures depending on its needs . <p> The hot side basking spot should be at 86-88 degrees . The cool @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it can drop down to 72 ambient temperature . The basking light should be housed in a good quality light dome like Exo Terra and Flukers that has a ceramic housing to tolerate high heat and an on/off switch . <p> Use a good quality temperature gauge too , like Zoo Meds digital temp gauge or Exo Terras Thermometer . Do n't guess at it . You can also use a rheostat and/or timers to control your heat source . We do not recommend the use of hot rocks . They have a tendency to heat unevenly over too small an area and can cause serious burns . <p> HUMIDITYGreen tree pythons have a tendency to get dehydrated , but the environment should not be constantly wet . Keep a non-porous water bowl in with your snakes and make sure it always has clean water . Exo Terras water bowls or Flukers water bowls are good decorative choices or a good ceramic crock dish . Scrub the bowl at least once a week to keep bacteria slime from building up . If you maintain humidity levels of 40-70% , your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hand misters are usually sufficient , but if you do n't want to hand mist , an automatic mister like the Exo Terra monsoon or the Reptile foggerare nice options . <p> FEEDINGDo not handle your green tree for several hours before you are going to feed it . They are generally not picky eaters and will usually take frozen thawed or live mice/rats . Be careful not overfeed your python . They are naturally slender snakes . <p> Hatchlings to 2 years1 rodent of appropriate size once a week . This means the girth of the rodent should not exceed the girth of the snake ( at it 's biggest point , not his neck size ) . You do not want to feed your green tree to large a meal . They sometimes can have problems with regurgitating meals if given food that is to large ( or too often ) . Do not handle your snake for at least 24 hours after it has eaten . <p> Adults You can cut back to 1 rodent every 2 weeks if you want . If you do this make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skimp . Another option is to continue on the once a week regime with a slightly smaller meal than if you are feeding every two weeks . <p> Snakes in general tend not to eat when they are in shed . Just wait to feed until your python sheds . <p> Babies usually will eat through the winter as long as they are warm enough . Some adults however , will go off food during this time . If your green tree wants to skip some meals in winter , just keep an eye on the snake 's overall condition and body weight . Typically with a healthy green tree python , this is nothing to worry about . If your snake is healthy and your husbandry and temperatures and good , then offer your python food every two weeks or so until it starts eating again . <p> TEMPERAMENTGreen tree pythons have gotten a bad rap over the years . They have a reputation of being aggressive . The best thing to do if you want to handle a your snake is to have a removable perch . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it from its resting place . If you then want to hold your snake , approach it from below , which is far less threatening than from above . Try not to pull the snake off of its perch . Gently lift the snake 's coils and offer your arm as another perch . Most green trees will tolerate limited handling . Some more than others . The Biak locality is known to be more temperamental.
