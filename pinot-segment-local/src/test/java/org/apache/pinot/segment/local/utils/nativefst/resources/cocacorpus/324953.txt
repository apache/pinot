@@101010236 @5210236/ <h> The Definitive Guide to Planning a New Content Initiative <h> The Definitive Guide to Planning a New Content Initiative <p> For most people , the start of a new year is a busy time. - Many of us spend time reflecting back on our accomplishments from the previous year . We also look forward and plan for the year to come . Marketing departments across the globe are no different . Many marketers are- evaluating the performance of 2015 campaigns and content initiatives , and- in content planning mode- for- new corporate objectives and a slew of new- tactical initiatives . <p> Sound familiar ? <p> With Divvys heavy focus on content strategy and planning , we work closely with many of our customer to help them think through the editorial strategy for each initiative , and the realities of what it will take for them- to execute- successfully and sustainably . To help the broader marketing community , we 've developed a comprehensive ebook- that asks the 10 most vital questions- that should be answered ( before you start executing anything ) to ensure the success of each- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Before you and your team get too deep into the weeds of execution , ask yourself these 10- questions . <p> 1 . What is the primary purpose or mission of this content initiative ? - <p> Seems obvious , eh ? In reality , I 'm no longer surprised when marketers have a hard time articulating the purpose of their various initiatives . Theres way too many shotguns at this party . And answers like " building brand awareness " or " to generate more leads " is n't good enough . You need to dig deeper . You need to create a purpose that delivers a specific value for not only your business , but the targeted recipient of this content . <p> 2 . Who is the target for this initiative ? <p> Notice I said target ( singular ) . If you 're producing content for everyone , you 're producing for no one . Countless content marketing research- reports ( like this one , slide 9 ) reinforce that- audience relevance is the largest contributor to effectiveness . All too often , new Divvy customers struggle to fill in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of target buyer profiles or personas . And I get that personas are often hard to nail down ( although platforms like Akoonu- and Cintell- are making it easier ) , but not defining a specific , single target audience for an initiative is just setting yourself up for failure . <p> 3 . How long are we planning to keep this initiative going ? <p> Is this just a short term experiment , or is your executive team expecting this to be a never-ending channel ? Certainly the type of content or medium often dictates this answer , but if you 're starting something like a new email initiative , social channel or website property , its pretty important that you think this through . If the initiative fails , do you have an exit strategy ? If it starts blowing out the top of your funnel ( see next question ) . <p> 4 . Have we chosen a content topic or area of focus that we can sustain ? In other words , might we run out of content ideas ? <p> This is certainly an area where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in. - Your subject matter experts get tapped out . You 've grown tired of writing about the same ol ' topic and hounding people for new ideas . On the surface , you may think of these as resources or process issues . In actuality , these are symptoms of a larger problem. - Check out the ebook for some exercises that will ensure you never run out of high-quality content . <p> 5 . Have we chosen a publishing frequency that we can sustain with high-quality , relevant content ? <p> The content quality vs. quantity debate has been going on for almost a decade now , and in my opinion , quality wins everytime . No matter which side of the argument you lean towards , we discuss- some harsh realities of which marketers need to be aware . And at the end of the day , you should pick a publishing frequency that you can sustain with good stuff . Start slow . You can always increase your frequency as your processes get better , you start seeing success , and you can dedicate more resources @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people and processes in place to sustain- this initiative ? <p> We see this everywhere , and guilty of it ourselves You start strong , but over time other responsibilities start to take priority , or passion fades , writers block creeps in and frequency sputters . The best way to combat this is to have dedicated resources ( people ) , documented processes ( regular content planning , production workflows ) , good tools built for this process , and accountability in place to turn your team- into a well-oiled content machine ( a.k.a. a publisher ) . Sustainability tips and best practices incoming ! <p> 7 . How will we know if/when this initiative has been a success ? <p> What does success look like for this initiative ? If you defined a specific purpose , how will you know when that- purpose has been achieved ? Or are you at least gaining traction ? Are there specific metrics or key performance indicators that can be monitored ? Try your best to specify some measurable , time-bound milestones in the future and document them so that your team @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 8 . Do we have the right tracking and reporting mechanisms in place to know when we get there ? <p> With metrics or KPIs identified in the previous step , its obviously important to build or connect the appropriate tracking mechanisms for capturing and reporting on this data . Sometimes that 's as simple as inserting some Google Analytics tracking code . Sometimes its a multi-pronged tracking and reporting methodology that might take some time to set up . Bottom line , - figure it out before you start . <p> 9 . Do we have a solid distribution or promotion strategy that will ensure we get enough eyeballs on this to- reach our goals ? <p> If your new content initiative will be targeted at a group of people with whom you already have a relationship ( ex : a customer list or subscriber list ) , then perhaps you do n't  need to worry about this question as much . But if you 're starting something from scratch and trying to reach new eyeballs , you have your work cut out for you in todays noisy environment. - " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obviously a- ridiculous- assumption. - Let us set proper expectations for which distribution and promotional strategies may be needed when trying to reach- owned vs. earned vs. paid audiences . <p> 10. - Which content planning , production and workflow tools are you going to need to execute your new initiative ? <p> Every day , more and more companies are realizing that their current system of endless spreadsheets , status meetings , and emails is way more painful than it should be .

These are full-fledged content items that are displayed alongside all other content in your DivvyHQ account ( your- dashboard , editorial calendar , etc. ) - <p> Publishing &amp; Promoting Other Content via Social - In this case , the content item you are working with is some other form of content ( ex : a blog post ) and you will be using DivvyHQ 's promotion tab to launch various social posts that promote this content item . These social posts are not the same as those in scenario #1 . They are stored differently in our system and- are not displayed on your dashboard or editorial calendar . However , you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Scheduled Posts tab on the Content interface ( more details below ) . <p> We want to make this distinction because Divvy 's social publishing features cover both cases , but your interaction with and usage of these features might be a little different for each scenario . <h> Scenario 1 - Planning , - Creating &amp; Publishing a- Social Post <p> The DivvyHQ Sandbox acts as a- container for all of the details associated with an individual content item , including- things like deadlines , workflow , team members , attachments , AND the actual content. - <p> Near the top of- the Details Tab , you 'll notice the " Summary / Description / Social Post " field , which plays a dual role . It can be used to store a general summary for a longer-form piece of content , or it can store the actual- text of your social post. - <p> As you interact with the social posting functionality , any text that is stored within that field will automatically populate the text area of your social posts. - <p> Once you've- established a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now see a " Post to Social " button within- the Details , Content , and Promotion tabs- of the Divvy Sandbox . Clicking this button in any of those views will trigger- the social post overlay ( form ) and , as mentioned previously , your social post text will populate the overlay 's text area . <p> Within the Social Post- overlay , you 'll see- the following elements : <p> Select channels - You can post to one or multiple channels at the same time . <p> Post text area - Edit your post text if needed . <p> Link Preview - If a link is included in your social post text , a link preview will be displayed . <p> Image Gallery - Select the attached image you want to accompany your post ( this will override any social post preview ) . <p> Enable scheduling -- Set a future date and time to publish the post . <p> Action button - Either " Post Now " or " Schedule Post " . <p> IMPORTANT NOTE : If you plan to post an image along with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an attachment on your- content item . To do this , open the attachments tab- and upload your image . You 'll then be able to select this image in the social post image gallery when setting up your social post . <h> Scenario 2 - Promoting Other Content <p> The Promotion tab can also be used to set up a schedule of social promotion for- other types of content ( ex : web content or blog posts ) . After the main web content is published , you can create multiple posts for various social channels and schedule them to publish on a desired schedule or frequency. - <p> Most of the instructions mentioned in Scenario #1 are still applicable , but you 'll likely need to craft your social posts ( text ) from scratch .

@@101010242 @5210242/ <p> Over the last decade , you have probably played a big role in transitioning one or multiple organizations from traditional marketing to our new content-centric , digital marketing world . From my experience , very few of these transitions have been easy . Roles have to change . New people often have to be hired . As Robert Rose , Lead Strategist for the Content Marketing Institute , puts it , using content to engage potential customers is " a new muscle " and new internal processes have to be built that support a more publisher-like structure . More on this from Robert here ( video ) . <h> Regular Content Planning Is a Big Chunk of That New Muscle <p> As companies start making this transition , I commonly hear such concerns as , " Brody , I just do n't  think were going to be able to come up with enough interesting or valuable content on a regular basis . " <p> Well , after an in-depth content strategy effort that digs in deep to the needs , pain and buying/selling cycles of your buyers and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ direction and a focus on your ideal content path . You have your roadmap . Now you just need to follow it and make sure you keep enough fuel ( content ) in the tank to get you to your destination . The best way to do this is with regular , strategic content planning . <h> Now picture this . <p> Your content team sits down around your conference table . Each team member has a blank notepad and pen ready to go . You kick things off " SoDoes anyone have any good content ideas ? " <p> This scenario is probably a little extreme , but perhaps you 've been there . You need something to warm up the room . You need something to get the creative juices flowing . <p> here 's a tip Create an agenda that not only helps facilitate brainstorming , but also helps team members prepare for each content planning meeting . <p> Instead of your team sitting down with blank notepads , help your team understand the components of your agenda and set the expectation that they need to bring ideas to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ newspaper context . You are the managing editor and every day you sit down with your team of section editors and reporters . Everyone knows their " beat " and they come ready to pitch their story ideas every day . What 's stopping you from executing this type of editorial planning effort ? Maybe you just need a step-by-step . Here it is . <h> Step 1 : Create Your Agenda <p> Here are several categories of conversation starters that really get the ball rolling <p> Recent customer stories or questions At last years Content Marketing Retreat , I listened to Rod Brooks , CMO of Pemco Insurance , share some great advice regarding how his team has created and leveraged remarkable content to become the top insurance company in Washington ( video here , well worth the 30 minutes ) . Rod has helped Pemco transform their internal culture to be great listeners and allow their customers to become the content . It really hit home when he mentioned that at every marketing team meeting , they start the meeting by someone telling a great story that they heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If your team is expected to bring a customer story or question to the table , good listening habits start to form . And with fresh stories and questions on the table , discuss how to turn them into good content ! <p> Data Review Hits &amp; misses from the previous month , quarter or campaign The data geek in me loves this one . When working with agency clients , we would sit down once per month and walk through our analytics dashboards to identify what worked and what did n't  from the previous months content marketing and social engagement efforts . We would also look at the effectiveness of the previous years campaigns to guide editorial decisions for upcoming **27;0;TOOLONG . The key questionHow can we improve our content ( quality , packaging , etc. ) to get more views , clicks , likes , shares , comments and most importantlyconversions ? <p> Buyer Profiles/Personas What new content can we create for each persona ? Occasionally , its a good idea to review the personas you 've developed with your team and focus your brainstorming on the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their needs or pain points ? Have you acknowledged your buyers skepticisms and created content that builds confidence in your solution ? Have you identified each of their " trigger events " ( physical events in their world that trigger a search for a solution related to your offerings ) and created content that introduces/teases your solution ? Has your product/service offering changed recently and it now solves new problems ? Is your content too heavily weighted towards one particular persona ? Should you beef up your content offering on other buyer segments that have been under-served ? <p> Buying Cycles What new content can we create that addresses each personas buying cycle/stages ? Along the same lines as the previous point , each type of buyer probably has a unique buying cycle . As part of your content strategy effort , you should be defining the buying stages for each influencer and decision maker that may play a role in moving your solution through their buying process . Basic buying cycles consist of several stages , including : awareness of the problem , research/discovery of possible solutions , validation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marketers break down these stages for each buyer target and determine ways in which specific content assets , delivered at the right time , can push buyers through to the next stage . For more on this , Digital Body Language by Steven Woods ( co-founder of Eloqua ) is a must-read . <p> Review Your Ideal Content Categories/Themes When you 've completed a thorough content strategy process , you likely have a clear understanding of the specific categories , sub-categories or content themes that will both meet your buyers needs and help you achieve your organizations goals and objectives . Review your list of categories/themes regularly and set the expectation that your team needs to continually try to add new content ideas to each bucket . <p> The Latest Industry Buzz What 's trending ? In the past , Ive written about the importance of having a Chief Listening Officer that acts as the air traffic controller for your company . Whether its this person , or your entire team keeping their ears to the ground , content teams need to stay on top of what 's trending inside and outside of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in which you can introduce something valuable or insightful into the conversation . DO NOT just butt in and try to sell something . Now flip the coin . Are there any general trending topics/events around the world that you can tie into your content ? Are there any " newsjacking " opportunities staring you in the face ? If/when opportunities like this arise , do not wait until your next planning meeting . Call an emergency meeting and get moving ! <p> Seasonal Opportunities In the B2C world , seasonality drives a good portion of marketing . In the B2B world , each industry is unique and its important to identify seasonal trends and buying patterns that may play a big role in the timing of your content marketing efforts . In your planning meetings , your team needs to be aware of that schedule and be proactive in your content/campaign planning . Any sales person will tell you that timing is everything . With Google playing a big role in everyones research toolkit , your content needs to be a few steps ahead . <p> Competitor Content Analysis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Strategy group member , for this great tip . Which topics are your competitors covering with their content ? Do you have more to offer on those topics ? Is there an opportunity to take something good of theirs and package it better ? What are they not covering that leaves a door open for you ? <h> Step 2 : Delegation , Expectations &amp; Accountability <p> When you 've nailed down your ideal agenda , think about how best to divvy ( BAM ! ) the prep work among your team members . Does your org chart lend itself to having each department head , product manager or SME cover his/her own beat ? Who are the most likely , customer-facing team members that can bring good customer stories and questions to the table ? Who is responsible for collecting/analyzing your content effectiveness data and preparing actionable insights ? What interesting nuggets should your chief listening officer have ready to present ? ( All this should provide a full Parking Lot ; o ) <p> Be very clear regarding who should be thinking about/covering what . Then based on your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be flushed out by the end of your meeting . Now , this is just one approach . It will probably take some trial and error to figure out the best approach for you and your team . The key is good communication , clear expectations and ACCOUNTABILITY . <h> Step 3 : Nail Down Your Meeting Schedule &amp; Stick to It <p> I cant tell you how many times Ive seen organizations start strong with a new content planning routine , but they cant sustain it . This comes back to the publishing mentality and structures that need to be implemented within organizations . Larger companies are going to do better at this since they can hire staff whose sole responsibility is to feed the content beast . For smaller companies , each team member needs to truly grasp the importance and value of content as a long-term asset for the organization . <p> Andrew Charlesworth , another one of my fellow Content Strategy group members , recently stated in a post , " It 's a difficult path to take when the finance or marketing director wants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are some enlightened companies who want to associate themselves with good content and are prepared to invest in the long-term benefits .

@@101010247 @5210247/ <h> What Are You Trying to Achieve With a Content Marketing Platform ? <p> If you 're in the early stages of evaluating a content marketing platform , its probably easy to articulate such things as the features that you feel you need , or the painful situations that keep popping up in and amongst your team . But I 'd like to challenge that level of thinking . <h> Are you thinking too small ? <p> Back in the late 90s during a summer break of college , I landed a job working for a telecommunications company in outside sales . The first week of that job was an intense sales training and I was introduced to the exercise of doing a needs analysis with prospects . My sales trainer laid out the theoretical conversation like this <p> This framework has served me well over the years , but the needs analysis conversation can be very different depending on the role and perspective of the prospect that I 'm talking to at the time . For example , an end user can easily speak to functional needs since they feel the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maker is more apt to care about higher-level business value . More often than not , we , the vendor , are helping prospects connect the dots between features , benefits and business value . <p> In this post , I 'd like to explore bigger outcomes that can be realized with content marketing platforms like Divvy . And bigger yet , I 'd like to help you connect those outcomes to the larger business implications that can result . Sound interesting ? <h> What are the outcomes you 're trying to achieve by implementing a content marketing platform ? <p> Review the list below . Heck , print this list and highlight the outcomes that relate to your situation . Narrowing in on your primary goals is a great starting point for your evaluation process . <p> 1 . Be more organized and proactive in your content planning Too many marketing and communications teams work in " reactive shotgun mode " every day . There is little-to-no strategic guidance , they are n't  planning far enough out , and they 're just publishing whatever is top-of-mind , hopeful that something gets clicks . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solid ( documented ) strategy and good planning processes/tools are consistently executing , capturing more eyeballs and moving needles . <p> 2 . Be more consistent with your content creation and publishing frequencies Consistent publishing frequency is one of the key attributes for a successful content marketing program . If consistency is lacking , youd better be prepared for lackluster results . In a recent eBook , we dedicated an entire chapter to this topic : The Five Realities of Publishing Frequency That May Keep You Up at Night . <p> 3 . Increase the efficiency of ( streamline ) your content marketing process Most of the time , inefficiencies within a content marketing process are a result of using the wrong tools . The " Big Three " ( spreadsheets , email collaboration and general project management systems ) are efficiency killers because of the extra time and effort that quietly creep into your process . <p> Has this ever happened ? You 're looking for an image that your designer optimized for an upcoming blog post . You spend the next 10 minutes scouring your inbox and file server @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get them on chat or the phone to send you another copy of the image . Thats 20 minutes that could have been spent on something more productive . Those lost minutes add up , especially when you multiply that by a large team of producers using the same inefficient methods . <p> 4 . Improve visibility and collaboration across multiple content teams or producers As we 've always said , silos are for storing grain , not content . Perhaps youve run into issues with confused customers because your messaging , voice or tone is completely different across channels . Or you 're hemorrhaging budget because one team is duplicating the efforts of another . These issues can be significantly minimized when collaboration and sharing are introduced through a content marketing platform . <p> 5 . Increase the volume of content you 're creating Depending on your industry , market or competitive landscape , perhaps you need to be producing a lot more content than you are currently . If you 're in the process of scaling up your output , then having a centralized hub to manage the planning , production @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quality of content you 're creating Perhaps youve just finished a content audit or were forced to have a come-to-Jesus meeting with your team where the message was loud and clearour content is not good enough . While this realization may be hard to swallow , at least you 're addressing it . What follows could be a more targeted content strategy and more resources being thrown at higher quality creative . A content marketing platform should play a key role in this evolution and help you stay aligned with your strategy . <p> 7 . Analyze how our content output aligns with/supports our strategy and business objectives One of the unique aspects of content marketing platforms is having the ability to analyze the performance of your content teams and auditing for gaps in the content they are producing . If your content strategy dictates a specific cadence of content for a certain audience , topic or stage in a buying cycle , content marketing platforms can help you execute on that goal . <h> Now Grab Your Crystal Ball <p> You 're reflecting on a successful year with your chosen content marketing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your team dove in and embraced a new way of working . You are now more organized and more proactive than you 've ever been . Youve been able to increase the quantity and quality of content you 're publishing , and your entire department is efficiently collaborating to plan and execute multiple integrated marketing programs simultaneously . Your strategy has matured and you 're now covering the entire customer journey with amazing content experiences , from the initial awareness stage through long-term customer advocacy . <h> Cost Savings <p> Waste reduction Youre able to minimize meetings , duplication of effort and be more efficient with outside vendor collaboration <p> Reduce turnover and burnout Your entire department is happier when they are organized and firing on all cylinders . <h> Happy Customers <p> I 'm sure I missed a few things in this post , but let 's not forget the most important thing that drives business growthhappy customers . Obviously your product/service offering plays a large roll in that , but do n't  underestimate the power of content to shape a customers experience with your brand .

I can quickly find out if something has been posted , scheduled or assigned . " <h> Spreadsheet Shortcomings <p> Like many marketing teams , UL used Google Sheets prior to DivvyHQ , but the spreadsheets were one-dimensional and did little to enhance efficiency and productivity . <p> " Spreadsheets were helpful enough to see what 's coming up , but they really do n't  track statuses very well . Everything was n't in one place , so you could n't assign things and notify someone that the ball is in their court , for example .

There is no limitation on the number of files that can be stored within a content item . The only limitation is the 50mb file size limit per uploaded file . There is no file-size limitation when files are attached from cloud storage platforms. - <p> Clicking the list view option in the Attachments Tab will provide you with : <p> The file type/format <p> Upload timestamp <p> The user who added the attachment <p> The file size <h> Inserting/Embedding Images within the DivvyHQ WYSIWYG <p> If you are wanting to insert an image within the body of your content , please note that there are differences between Divvy 's WYSIWYG ( What You See Is What You Get ) editor and other CMS editors that are built for presenting a public web page ( Ex : Wordpress ) . For starters , DivvyHQ and Wordpress- actually use the same editor called TinyMCE . TinyMCE is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HTML ( behind the scenes ) . The difference comes with how and where your images are stored and referenced within the HTML code. - <p> Sticking with the Wordpress example ... When you insert an image into your content with Wordpress ' WYSIWYG , Wordpress is doing a few things : <p> Saving a copy of that image file to your website 's server in a public folder ( Wordpress is managing the " hosting " of your image file and other media ) <p> Creating a public URL for that image that anyone can- access <p> Referencing that public URL with HTML code that embeds the image into your web page content <p> Displaying the image on your screen , positioned where you intended it to go . - <p> When you publish that web page , all your content is there and when the browser comes across the URL for the image , it knows to go fetch it on your web server and present it to the viewer. - <p> Now ... Here 's how and why DivvyHQ is different . <p> Even though you might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our platform , Divvy is designed to be a secure platform for producing and routing content for approval , not final presentation . You may need to create multiple versions of an image before it is ready for the public . This is why we have our " Attachments " feature ( discussed above ) so you can attach images/files/media to your content item and route them through any required review or approval steps. - <p> If you still want to embed an image into the content , you can , but your image needs to be hosted on a public web server and the " Source " would be the URL of it 's location on the web ( not your computer 's file system ) . <p> So if you want to embed an image into- your content on DivvyHQ , you have two options : <p> 1 . Upload your image- to a publicly hosted server ( ex : the Wordpress media library ) , - copy the URL , go back to your content item in Divvy , click the insert-image button and then copy/paste this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ image to your DivvyHQ content item , copy the url from the preview image after attaching it , click the insert-image button and the copy/paste the into the Source field . <p> Here 's a quick Pro Tip Video that demonstrates this second option . <h> Our Suggestion <p> Assuming you still want to communicate your desire to insert an image in a certain location , without inserting the image source code , we suggest just including a little reference snippet ( like below ) within your content. - <p> ( insert filename.png here ) <p> Then make sure you 've uploaded that file within Divvy 's Attachments panel . This will save you time and allow your website designer/CMS manager to handle the image storage and HTML code components , which is probably what they 're employed to do in the first place ... ; )

With only 30 minutes to present , I did n't  get a chance to dig into some of the custom Google Analytics reports that I use to measure content effectiveness and efficiency . One such report , created by Mr. Google Analytics himself , Avinash Kaushik , can provide amazing insights into the effectiveness of your individual website pages and blog posts . So I thought I 'd dig into that a little more here and show you how to download it so that you can start leveraging it within your own analytics account . <h> Which Content Pieces are Moving the Needle ? <p> Avinashs Content Efficiency Report is a huge time saver , because it gives you one report with data that you would normally have to view within several , standard GA reports . here 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought process when reading it . <p> Page Title Whether you 're evaluating the effectiveness of a static web page , blog post or download , this report lists each page and helps you understand how site visitors are interacting with it . <p> Entrances Its great to find out which pages are acting as your sites front door ( vs. your homepage ) . Comparing this metric to your bounces can help you determine how well these entrance pages are doing to get visitors engaged in your site . <p> Bounces When a user enters your site , only views one page and then leaves , that 's a bounce . Most would think that pages or posts with high bounce rates are a bad sign , but its not that simple . Consider a blog post that you have promoted via Twitter . An interested visitor sees your tweet and rolls into read it . Its the best post he s read in a long time , so he leaves your site and proceeds to retweet your post within his Twitter client . This situation is still a bounce , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It does tell us , though , that we probably need to think about incorporating better calls-to-action and/or internal links that entice visitors to want to dig deeper into our site . <p> Unique Visitors , Pageviews &amp; Avg . Time on Page I included these three together because combined , they do a good job of helping us understand how each page was consumed by the reader . In the screenshot above , our Blog Post Promotional Checklist was viewed by 3,914 unique people , but it was viewed 4,665 times , so many of those folks must have viewed it more than once . And then the Avg . Time on Page shows us how long they spent with it . Great to see people spending more than 17 minutes with that single piece of content . <h> Do You Smell Bacon ? <p> The final two metrics in this report , Per Visit Goal Value and Goal Completions are the two that really help you understand which pieces of content are bringing home the bacon . But if you do n't  have an actual goal set up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place , then these columns are going to be blank . If you have n't done that , watch this and get it done . With your goals and goal value set up , you should see values in these two columns . <p> Per Visit Goal Value This metric does some fancy math behind the scenes , but its basically an indicator of " visitor quality " . If you look at the screenshot above and compare the two pages , our checklist post pulled in a much lower quality of visitors based on the ratio of visitors to goal completions . When we do the math , that checklist post made us $39.14 . Now compare that to the " 7 Reasons " post . With only 228 visitors , it made us $100.32 . Quality makes a HUGE difference . <p> Goal Completions Fancy math aside , its good to see which how many actual conversions are happening as a result of each piece of content .

@@101010305 @5210305/ <p> One of the biggest challenges we 've grappled with at DivvyHQ is the reality that content marketing , as a practice , is a wholesale shift in the way companies approach marketing . Not only does content marketing require a mindset shift for corporate communications teams , but the process of creating customer-centric content and delivering it via multiple channels consistently requires many other flavors of creative change , including a strategic shift , process changes and people . <p> Our particular struggle , as a content marketing platform , revolves around our reliance on our customers to not only adopt our product , but to fully adopt and commit to the practice of content marketing . If they 've ramped up several new content marketing initiatives and brought on DivvyHQ to help them manage the process , they may realize several months in that they suck at this content thing , it does n't  seem to be working , and quit . " Well , I guess we do n't  need Divvy anymore . " <p> Internally , we often liken this situation to someone wanting to get healthy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a nice gym . They get a few free weeks with a personal trainer . Theyve started off strong , but theyve neglected to make some lifestyle changes ( eating better , getting more sleep ) and gradually fade in their commitment when results do n't  come fast enough . They stop getting out of bed early to go to the gym and eventually decide to cancel their gym membership . Its pretty obvious to point out where the failure happened . It was n't the gym . <p> Based on our reliance on our customers to commit to content marketing , we have a vested interest in doing everything we can to help customers facilitate internal change , make the commitment , and adopt a product that may smooth the waters of their transition . Many of the prospective customers who walk through our door every day are often neck deep in organizational change . In some cases , we can easily detect that their efforts to get internal commitment is on shaky ground . Their core team is on board , but the larger marketing organization is still stuck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This Book <p> Let me start by saying that this book was not an easy read for me . I found it very academic and packed with research findings that left my head spinning at times . That said , the concepts of creativity , innovation and managing change are big , nuanced topics to unpack , and Mueller does a nice job of putting forth the premise that people actually both love and hate creativity in certain circumstances . <p> Executives <p> It was fascinating to hear several examples of business leaders who create wide-scale innovation programs and pride themselves on fostering innovation within their companies , but are quick to shoot down a creative idea that just has too many unknowns . Our human brain is not a fan of uncertainty , and there can be multiple layers of bias that , in some circumstances , prompt a knee-jerk reaction that shuts down an idea right out of the shoot . <p> Mueller talked a lot about mindset throughout the book and explained that business leaders often approach decisions with a " how/best " mindset , meaning they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tendency for these leaders to pass on creative ideas that have too much uncertainty , and prioritize ideas that are only incremental improvements to the existing , comfortable status quo . The scary part about this is that for many companies , both past , present and future , this mindset only sends companies into a downward spiral to irrelevance . <p> Muellers research , along with other studies cited in the book , find that truly innovative companies tend to be led by people who naturally have a " why/potential " mindset , which evokes a tolerance for creative ideas . Its not a stretch to put such leaders as Mark Zuckerberg and Elon Musk in this category . <p> Tesla Engineer : " Hey Elonwere doing all this cool stuff with car batteries , right ? What if we put these in homes and slap a solar roof on the house ? " <p> Elon : " Sure , that sounds cool . Let 's do it ! " <p> Ok , ok Probably a stretch , but now just think about the engineers at Kodak that brought digital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how that ended up . <p> Bottom line , decision makers should understand the psychological forces that are at play and recognize when their own internal biases and fear of uncertainty could be severely limiting their companys ability to evolve and be innovative . Executives should read this book . <p> Creatives &amp; Innovators <p> On the other side of the creative coin , creatives and innovators come up with creative ideas every day . Many work in the very same companies who encourage creativity and innovation , only to have ideas shot down , one after the other . And then business leaders wonder why their rockstars leave . <p> Mueller stresses the importance of not only understanding the psychological barriers of decision makers that may stand in the way of implementing a creative idea , but also provides guidance on how innovators should frame and market ideas within the organization . <p> She introduces a variety of frameworks and best practices that can be employed when pitching creative ideas and when trying to implement new products or processes . I personally love a particular framework that Mueller created @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is designed to help innovators sell their creative ideas internally . <p> Fit Help others see how the creative idea will be a good fit within their current reality . When there 's a fit , people will feel safe . When there 's a mis-fit , they do n't  feel safe . They feel that something is wrong . <p> Aha When pitching ideas , its helpful to use an analogy ( ex : my gym membership metaphor above ) or some sort of comparison between two existing , well-known things . We see this all the time in the startup world . A fellow Kansas City startup called Bungii has always sold themselves as Uber for Trucks . Need to move something big , but have a small car ? The Bungii app is your friend with a truck . <p> Broaden These strategies revolve around getting people to broaden their mindsets away from the status quo , and start to want the new thing . One of the best tactics here is an exercise Mueller calls the " feedback pitch " where you present the idea in a way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . With the decision makers involvement in working through any concerns and crafting the final solution , they ultimately have more ownership in the idea ( a.k.a . " Make it their idea " ) . <h> The Most Frustrating Insight <p> This book is packed with intriguing insights , but the most jarring to me revolved around the difficult process of cultivating change in an organization . As much as wed like to , you ca n't strong-arm creative change in most organizations . The more you try to force creative change on people that are comfortable with the status quo , the more they may rebel and do the opposite . <p> People will only accept creative change when they realize that their current status quo is blocking them from achieving what they want . Something has to fail or a pain threshold has to be crossed . Mueller writes : <p> " People will only change if they feel something . They change when they feel embarrassed , frustrated or ashamed of the status quo . I believe that effectively pitching a creative idea , and communicating it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difficult as generating a terrific invention . " <h> Putting This Into Practice <p> When it comes to cultivating change at the organizational level , this book did provide my team with several strategies for helping our customers introduce a better approach , cultivate change and facilitate adoption of content marketing best practices , processes and tools . Perhaps it can help you and your leadership do the same . 50881 @qwx910881

And getting it " done " probably is n't even the last step in " the process " . DivvyHQ includes a variety of workflow tools to allow teams to either keep things simple , or get very specific ... whichever each situation ( or each team ) requires. - <p> For starters , DivvyHQ has a basic workflow baked into the application . Each content item has a " Content Status " field that includes the states shown below . Each content item can be moved through this workflow by updating the status field within each content item . <h> Task Management <p> DivvyHQ also includes a task management layer that sits underneath each content item .

For example , producing a blog post might consistently require- the following steps : first draft , source a photo , initial review/editing , final review , post to Wordpress. - <p> Building this workflow template automates the process of creating individual tasks for each content item ( a big time saver ) . Additionally , specifying " average duration " automates deadline scheduling for each task , so you 'll actually have a better chance of completing your content on time ! <p> To create a custom workflow for an individual calendar , follow the steps below . <p> You can add and edit as many production steps as you wish between the ' In Production ' and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ click the green Add New Step button .

The actual creation and editing of real content is only a subset of what this interface does . So we kicked off a naming exercise and landed on a name that encompasses more of its value . <p> We think of a sandbox as a safe environment ( you are n't  going to break anything ) where you can be creative , collaborate , iterate and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it going into a live production environment ( i.e. a public website , blog , etc . ) . This name fits nicely in our book . <h> A Quick Walkthrough <h> Design &amp; UX Considerations <p> Within any content marketing software application , the content production and collaboration area is always going to be the most complex . It has to house and present every content detail and facilitate a creative process that is rarely consistent . Content comes in all shapes , content teams come in all sizes , and everyone uses the application differently . At the end of the day , our goal has always been to help you get a content project from idea to published as efficiently as possible . <p> Feeling Cramped With our 3.0 Sandbox now live , I can say that we always felt cramped with our 2.0 Content Editor .

As you navigate the new Sandbox , you 'll notice how we 've revamped how team members are assigned ( shown below ) and content strategy lists are presented and used . <p> Locked for Editing Although we previously provided a warning notification to users when they opened a content item that was currently being editing by another team member , overwriting content and details was still possible . The new " edit states " for the Details tab and Content tab provides a much more secure environment that should eliminate any potential issue of team members editing the same piece of content simultaneously . <h> Other Slick Improvements <p> Alongside the big , noticeable changes , we implemented a variety of smaller quality-of-life improvements , many of which were requested by customers over the years .

The default screen will provide a history of content imports that have already been completed . From this interface , you can view the content associated with past imports or undo previous imports. - <p> To start a new import , click the New Import button and then walk through our 5-step import wizard. - <p> For Step 1 , select the calendar to which you want to import content . Due to DivvyHQ 's calendar architecture , which ensures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't see , it 's important that you choose which calendar your imported content will belong to . So if your calendar structure is separated by channel , you 'll want to create a separate CSV file for each channel. - <p> Step 2 " Format your spreadsheet " It 's important that we try to map your spreadsheet data to the available fields within Divvy . So doing some formatting of your existing spreadsheet will save you some time later on . To speed up the process , we 've provided you with a CSV template that spells out the available fields within Divvy . <p> I have the template pulled up here , so let 's walk through a few things . The first things to note are the column headers . Your spreadsheet does n't have to match this perfectly , but these columns represent the fields that we currently support . If your spreadsheet has additional fields , those can also be imported during the field mapping process. - <p> Another thing to note is the importance of matching the data values of various fields like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the data that you include in your Content Type column should ideally match the content types that you 've specified within your Divvy account . If they do n't match , our system will assume that you want to create new custom content types . This scenario also applies for each content strategy field . This extra step will ensure that your data is clean when imported . <p> Step 4 allows you to map your spreadsheet 's fields to DivvyHQ 's content fields . The field mapper displays your column headers at the top , and a single row of your data . All you need to do from here is select the matching Divvy field for each column . I 'll run through this quickly so you can see how it works . <p> For Step 5 , give your import session a name so you can find it later in your import history . <p> To complete the process , click Start Import .

You 're busier than all heck , you cant find the time to collaborate , and youre struggling to keep up with the breakneck pace of content production . <p> In our research , we uncovered common challenges , bottlenecks , tactics , and most importantly the " habits " of the most successful content professionals . The following 7 stood out as the most likely to help you improve your content planning , content strategy , and overall content production efforts . <h> Habit #1 : Combine Proven and Emerging Tactics <p> As marketers , content professionals , or social media practitioners , we tend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continues to rapidly evolve , chasing the next silver bullet tactic is a draw few can resist . And why wouldnt we ? Its harder than ever to get in front of customers , so bring on the silver bullets ! <p> The truth is , there 's merit to leveraging tried and true tactics and channels for reaching customers , as long as they still work . In our research , we asked marketers to list their top content marketing tactics , and they said : <p> 89% still leverage email <p> 88% write blog articles <p> 80% include video <p> This is no surprise . Email , blogs , and video are all wonderful methods for reaching your target audience , and you should not abandon these tactics . But the smartest marketers balance tried-and-true tactics with emerging methods for engagement . <p> We dug a layer deeper into our data and found that those who report having the most success with their content planning also plan to use the following tactics in the coming months : <h> Habit #2 : Plan 1+ Months in Advance <p> Advanced planning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In our research , we found that 73% of the most successful content practitioners plan content 1 month , or several months in advance . <p> When it comes to content planning , you 'll want to strike a balance between advanced topical planning , and creating newsworthy content in real-time . While it may feel daunting to develop a content calendar more than a month in advance , its truly well within your reach . Agree on a weekly cadence , get ahead on your calendar , and focus on execution . <h> Habit #3 : Meet Weekly as a Team <p> Conducting productive team meetings takes great skill and coordination . If all else fails , resort to donuts . While many of the more introverted content professionals would prefer to avoid meetings , getting together to discuss content is imperative to success . <p> In our research , we discovered that the most effective marketers meet daily , weekly , or monthly , depending on the complexity of their content programs . We also discovered that marketers who reported ineffective programs meet less regularly than their successful counterparts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ report being extremely or somewhat effective meet weekly , or monthly <p> 67% of those that meet weekly , or daily report meeting most or all of their content planning objectives . <p> Its obvious that meeting on the regular to discuss objectives , performance , cadence , and concepts is a key habit among highly effective marketers . <h> Habit #4 : Collaborate for Improved Performance <p> In our research , we discovered that a full 59% of marketers say they are " too busy " to collaborate . In our experience , collaboration is key to content planning , and creating incredible content . As more content professionals wade into developing interactive , visual , and video content , collaboration will be a linchpin for successful teams . <p> We also found that a full 80% of marketers plan to create video content in the coming months .

In their 2017 study , they reported that just 37% of B2B and 40% of B2C marketers have a documented content strategy .

@@101010349 @5210349/ <h> The No-Bullshit Guide to Evaluating Content Marketing Platforms <p> With a few years in sales at DivvyHQ under my belt , it does n't  take much to spot an informed , organized buyer from the impulse buyer who is in the middle of a content shit show , and has n't  spent time thinking about what they really need . Truth be told , I much prefer the former , despite the fact that the informed buyer will probably scrutinize me and our content marketing platform much more thoroughly . <p> But why do I prefer the harder sale ? The answer is simple . <p> If they put that much time and effort into researching and finding the right solution , they will likely put the same or more effort into making sure their chosen solution is a success . As you may know , I 'm a big fan of that . <p> So without mincing any more words , here are 8 tips and considerations that I wish every content marketing platform buyer would think about before engaging with me. <h> 1 . Create a Problems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ software tools , its really easy to start immediately comparing features . But let me save you some time right now by saying this : apples-to-apples comparisons do n't  exist for content marketing platforms . Each solution has a specific focus , unique functional offerings and a unique user experience . A feature checklist , although useful , will not paint an accurate picture of a platforms value or its likelihood of actually being adopted by your team . <p> Instead , create a " problems list " that verbalizes the major pain points for which you are trying to solve . Each platform may have a different way of solving that pain , and the only way you 'll see it is by discussing your list with each vendor , and letting them demonstrate the solution . If you can easily see how the features and experience would solve each problem , then move to the next step in your evaluation . <h> 2 . Limit the Number of Tools You Evaluate <p> Its not uncommon to hear that a prospect has just signed up for 8 content marketing platforms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . How can you expect to properly evaluate 8 platforms in 4 weeks , let alone 4 hours ? Will you even remember which one is which ? Sure , you might have found 8 platforms that look like they might fit the bill , but you 'll quickly get overwhelmed and suffer from paralysis by analysis . <p> My advice : Pick a max of 2-3 platforms whose websites/content/videos speak directly to the major problems on your list . Engage with their sales/demo process and focus your Q &amp; A on the top 2-3 items on your problems list . If one or more of these platforms are n't  hitting the mark , then you can quickly move on and expand your shortlist . <h> 3 . Be Prepared for Your Trial Period(s) <p> I hear this all the time " I started our 14-day trial , but then I realized I should get some of my team on boardand we thought we should have a meeting to talk about the platformand then something came up.and now were ready , but our trial has expired . " <p> Before starting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stakeholders should be included in your " trial team " and get them together to craft a plan . Review the problems list with them so they have the proper context and expectations . If possible , pick some REAL content projects that you could manage in the platform from start to finish . Ask the trial team to record any likes or dislikes with the platforms functionality and user experience . Focus on one trial at a time , then gather as a group , compare notes and determine which content marketing platforms delivers the most value . <h> 4 . Be a Straight Shooter <p> Ive been in sales a long time , and at times people can be hesitant to share information with us early on when they 're just kicking the tires . I get it . Just know that we can move the conversation along much faster and be more helpful if you just tell me , honestly , two things : <p> Where you are in your evaluation process Are you just kicking tires to see what its all about ? That 's perfectly fine ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yesterday ? That 's great ! <p> Which other tools you 're evaluating Im going be a straight shooter , too . We know what our competitors offer and I 'm going to tell you when another platform would actually serve your needs better than Divvy . <p> By expressing this up front , I can better deliver the information that would be most helpful for your current stage . You will get exactly what you ask for . If you do n't  get what you ask for , this could be a great way to shuffle the cards and weed out some content marketing platforms who are n't  listening to you ! <h> 5 . Be Open &amp; Ready for Change <p> Change management is one of the biggest challenges in adopting new software . In the content marketing context , most companies are coming from a chaotic environment of spreadsheets , emails , meetings and stress . Something has to change or else your team will continue to be stuck in an inefficient and frustrating rut for who knows how long . <p> Be open to seeing the possibilities of how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free yourself from the shackles of spreadsheets . Getting comfortable with these changes can take time and that 's ok ! For some , the change is so necessary , its like a duck to water from day one . Every team is different ! <h> 6 . All Aboard ! <p> Talk with each vendor about their onboarding process and services . Yes , there may be an additional cost for this service , but onboarding is an absolutely critical piece of the content marketing platform implementation process . Not completing a proper onboarding process with your team is setting yourself up for low adoption . Over time , the chaotic world you were trying to get out of leaks back in . And like the drip of a leaky pipe , you are once again flooded with inefficiency because you were just trying to avoid the extra onboarding fee . <h> 7 . Test Their Support Responsiveness ( Very Important ! ) <p> With any software product , there will be bumps in the road and you will find yourself in need of some roadside assistance . Perhaps you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and you need to talk through a new situation . THIS IS COMMON with content marketing platforms ! The last thing that you want to learn is that you 've just invested time , money and effort into a new platform , only to find that the vendors support stinks . <p> During your trial , even if you just have a minor question , engage with the vendors support channels . Check out their knowledgebase and evaluate its quality . Submit a support ticket and note their responsiveness . Shoot them a note on social and see how long it takes for them to engage . Do n't  underestimate the importance of support as part of your evaluation and overall success with a new platform . <h> 8 . Think Annually or Longer <p> Not only does an annual or multi-year contract immediately secure the best possible up-front cost , it gives all parties the time needed to properly mold a content marketing platform to the needs , organization and workflows of your team . By making a year commitment , you 're telling your team ( and the software vendor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your biggest content marketing challenges . <p> Jenni is a Regional Account Manager for DivvyHQ .

Fun Fact : We launched DivvyHQ at the first ever Content Marketing World ( CMW ) in September of 2011 . <p> This is our 6th CMW and each year this conference is packed with amazing presentations by the industrys smartest and most creative content marketing practitioners in the world . There 's no shortage of ideas and inspiration that flows from this show and we leverage these ideas in many ways throughout the year . <p> Note that I did n't  say , " We do a conference recap blog post . " There is certainly value in publishing a thoughtful recap immediately after the show is over ( social shares , backlinks , etc. ) , but that juice wont have a long shelf life . Think about it this way How often do you have the opportunity to have this many industry innovators and thought leaders in the same building at the same time ? These are golden opportunities to not only learn , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ audience . <p> So I ask you Do you have similar conferences in your industry ? Are you just there to support sales ( get new leads ) or do you attend the educational sessions ? If you are n't  inspired by the conferences you attend for your industry , perhaps you 're going to the wrong conferences . Or , you 're not doing it right . <h> Squeezing Content Marketing Value from Tradeshows/Conferences <p> here 's a simple way to use industry conferences to fill up your bank of content ideas .

Pick the Best Sessions &amp; Assign a Reporter <p> Of course this assumes that you 're not attending this conference by yourself . If you are rolling solo , that 's fine ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a team , make sure each staff member has their agenda nailed down . <h> 3 . Prepare for each session <p> These days , most conferences have a conference website and each educational session has a synopsis of some sort . Review each of your sessions descriptions and devise 1-3 questions that you feel should be answered during the presentation . If your questions do n't  get answered , ask them in the Q&amp;A at the end . <h> 4 . During the Session : Put Your Reporter Hat On <p> The best reporters are those who can craft a compelling story from just about any type of event , even the most mundane . Throughout the presentation , do n't  just take notes that mirror the presentation slides . Listen for interesting nuggets , stats or stories that provide compelling answers to the questions you jotted down before the session . Type fast . <h> 5 . Put Your Photographer Hat On <p> Depending on the layout of the room , and perhaps where you sit , try to snap a few photos with your phone to capture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compelling presentation visuals/slides. <h> 6 . Get a selfie with the presenter ! <p> This one is optional , but fun . If time and/or the speaker permits , be quick and try to catch the speaker before they leave . Thank them for the great presentation , tell them that you 're writing an article on this topic and ask if they would mind taking a quick picture with you . Most speakers will be flattered and happy to oblige . <h> 7 . The Next 48 Hours <p> Its unfortunate , but the inspiration and excitement that you feel from a new content idea can wane after a few days . As soon as you can , after each conference session you attend , find a quiet place and review your notes . Complete important thoughts and sentences , fill in holes and try to create a solid outline for your content piece . How should this story be packaged ? Blog post ? Social post ? Email ? Something bigger ? The more thought you put into it now , the better the chance this idea actually gets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ juicy details that gave the idea nice flavor in the moment . <h> One Last Idea <p> For a big , inspiring conference like Content Marketing World , one person could probably create 10-20 new pieces of content .

This allows you to set an appointment with your audience and focus on the highest quality content but also on a regular schedule . " <p> Michael Brenner , Founder , Marketing Insider Group <p> While you should be feeding ideas into your content calendar that are SEO-informed , and relevant to your audience , do n't  spend hours coming up with outlines for each piece . Get some solid ideas logged in your calendar , and focus your energy on execution . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need paragraph after paragraph of details in outline form . <h> Idea #2 : Be More Dynamic <p> There are dozens of " best practices " out there for social media , content marketing , and business communications that can be helpful , but at the same time stifling . Do n't  get stuck thinking every blog post you write has to be 1,500 words . Or , that each Tweet needs your hashtag . Or that the video needs to be exactly 2:00 long . <p> Instead , plan a healthy mix of short and long-form content . While habits built around best practices are good , breaking the clutter is better . <h> Idea #3 : Get Obsessed with Your Audience <p> Sometimes coming up with ideas for a content calendar can be as simple as going out and asking your audience what they want to hear about . <p> In our research , we found that a measly 13% of marketers attributed " improved audience targeting " to greater success in content planning . <p> This was surprising , since audience targeting and audience intelligence are essential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recently joined our Board of Directors , weighed in on this just a few weeks ago : <p> " Getting past our organizational priorities to truly examine and know what our audience needs is the only way we can ensure our planning efforts will be more impactful with content . " <p> Robert Rose , Chief Strategy Advisor , Content Marketing Institute <p> Instead of throwing spaghetti at the wall , try to find a handful of people that fit within the general parameters of your target audience . Get to know them , and well . Where do they currently go for content ? What are the challenges they face ? What sort of answers could you deliver about a subject that they cant find elsewhere ? What 's their favorite kind of cookie ? <p> And if your excuse is , " we do n't  have budget for marketing research " then I would challenge you to consider how much money you 're waste creating the wrong content over and over again . Much more than investing in a few simple conversations with your customers up front . <h> Idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it can feel like you need to pull ideas right out of thin air . But starting from scratch is frankly not something you should ever have to do when building out a content calendar . <p> Most organizations ( and likely yours too ) have dozens of assets , interviews , and content waiting to be repurposed . Consider recycling content in the following ways : <p> Identify whitepapers , or technical publications that can be punched up , and broken up into multiple blog posts <p> Conduct professional interviews with internal subject matter experts and leverage the content as podcast material , video , or text-based interview content ( make sure it speaks to what your customers are most passionate about ) <p> Once you start identifying the multi-faceted nature of a single asset , coming up with dozens of ideas to fill your calendar is much less daunting . <h> Idea #5 : Look to Influencers <p> In our research , we found that 81% of marketers who reported being most successful with their content planning also will to use influencer-driven content in the coming months @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter experts with their finger on the pulse of the customer . And they can also stir up some serious attention online . If you 're looking to feed the content cookie monster , theyll know what he s hungry for . <p> Seek to uncover who your audience trusts , and where they currently go to get information . Are there thought leaders , bloggers , small publishers , or up-and-coming innovators that your customers rave about ? Keep tabs on those folks . Track their conversations , posts , and beliefs . This should give you ideas for what you likewise could be publishing . <p> The second step is to nurture them over time . If you play your cards right , they just might want to partner with you on creating some content . <p> " To bring credibility , quality , and the voice of the customer into brand content marketing , I am very keen on the role of working with influencers . Companies have many reasons to create content and engage with the public , and I do n't  know of a more effective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plays an important part .

@@101010365 @5210365/ <h> Articles in this section <h> Content Strategy Tab <h> Overview <p> A guide to implementing and using the content strategy fields in the calendar admin section . 50880 @qwx910880 <h> Content Strategy Fields- - <p> Content strategy is a key , upfront component of any successful content marketing initiative . Typical content strategy exercises include identifying your key audiences ( personas ) , being thoughtful about the content topics they care about , and having a plan for how to produce and deliver that content to them on a consistent basis . <p> With these best practices in mind , DivvyHQ provides several common , content strategy fields that can be preloaded with meta data that you 've identified through your content strategy process . This allows you to mold your content strategy into the application , tag your content appropriately , and use this valuable meta data for various filtering and reporting purposes . <h> Available Fields <p> Content strategy meta data can be added on a per calendar basis or at the Parent and All Calendars level . You can preload the following content strategy fields @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need to reach and resonate ? Keep yourself and your team focused in on those individuals during content production . <p> Buyer Stages- " Have you mapped your buyer 's journey ? Which content types or topics would be most effective at each stage ? Organizations who are thoughtful about this often " win " . <p> Publishing Channels- " To which channels do you publish content ? Preload your publishing channels so your team knows where each piece will ultimately live . <p> Promotional Channels- " Will you be promoting your content after it 's published ?

You have the option to add meta data to single calendars , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Calendars level . There is some data propagation set up behind the scenes , so for example , adding a content topic at the All Calendars level will propagate that topic down ( make it available ) to all parent and child calendars . This may be a big time saver if you have consistent topics or audiences that are applicable to all your calendars . <p> Select how you want to load your content strategy data via the calendar drop down menu in the top blue header . Then simply fill in the corresponding content strategy field and push the green Add button ( see Figure 24 ) . - <p> ( Figure 24 ) <p> Pro Tip : - If you 've added your content strategy meta data at the All Calendars or Parent calendar level , you can adjust which values will be present at the child calendar level using the checkboxes next to each value . <p> Editing or Deleting a Content Strategy Values <p> Next to each content strategy value , you 'll see blue Edit and Delete links .

If you disable a field , that field will not be visible within Divvy 's content editor .

Here are a few that may sound familiar . <p> " Weve had a few situations where different teams are not sharing assets and they 're spending time and money ( with two separate ad agencies ) creating basically the same peice of content . " <p> " I 'm responsible for producing some of my companys content , but my day gets swallowed up by having to make constant updates to our editorial calendar spreadsheet and several hours of email conversations explaining what changed on the spreadsheet . " <p> " Our publishing company is pretty siloed and we 've tried just about everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ managing editors to collaborate better and share content assets . " <p> " Several team members are consistently missing content deadlines and I 'm tired of having to babysit them . " <h> Empathetic Content <p> When companies go through a proper buyer profiling exercise , we typically see a shift from egocentric content to empathetic content . This shift can translate to much more relevant content that resonates immediately with your buyers . If you take each need , each pain point or each trigger event and turn it into a blog post , email campaign or social engagement question , do n't  be surprised when prospects come out of the woodwork with their checkbook in hand . <p> here 's one particular example from our blog that makes me laugh everytime I read it .

@@101010389 @5210389/ <h> 5 Tips to Perfect Your Longform Storytelling <p> Content has been king among marketing strategies for several years now , and it 's evolved rapidly during that time . We 've seen content influence everything from social media to the way we think about thought leadership , and now a new trend is on the rise . Longform storytelling is the future of content marketing . <p> Deeply researched , eloquently written narratives have long been the gold standard of great journalism . So it 's no surprise that longform storytelling has made its way into the marketing world , since the lines between traditional media and branded content become blurrier all the time . <h> The Logic Of Longform <p> Its easy to see why content marketing is headed in the longform direction . Such packages often have a longer shelf life than more timely articles , and they allow brands to explore diverse topics in depth . If you 're working on a financial brand , you can create blog posts or ebooks that delve into such dense subjects as day trading versus investing in annuities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your brand 's personality throughout the writing and build trust through the engaging content . <p> A compelling , humorous , or otherwise evocative piece of writing initiates a different kind of customer relationship than a quick hit " X Tips to Financial Success " blog post . The latter is emotionless and easily forgotten ; the former stays with readers . Longform features present great opportunities to take external audiences behind the curtain . People do business with other people , and great narratives humanize even the biggest corporations . <p> That 's why the American Express piece was such a hit . It was thoughtful and unexpected , and it showed another side of the company 's interests . When you connect consumers with the actual people who make your company move , the more loyalty theyll have for your brand . <h> How To Tell Great Stories <p> You do n't have to be a powerhouse publisher to create quality longform content . The opportunities to share your brand 's narrative are limitless if you know where to look . About Us pages are a fantastic place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first places new customers go to learn about who they will be doing business with . You can also weave your story through social media and blog content , then expand on your values in longer articles . Use the following strategies to up your narrative offerings in the new year . <p> 1 . Educate your content producers on storytelling basics . <p> Even if they 've studied writing in college or grad school , it never hurts to take a refresher course and learn new strategies . There are lots of great books , courses , and blog posts that will help your team members take their storytelling games to the next level . <p> 2 . Create a storytelling culture . <p> One-on-one customer conversations make great narrative fodder , which is why PemCo Insurance CMO Rod Brooks starts his meetings by asking everyone to share a customer story from the previous week . This habit inspires people to pay more attention to potential content opportunities and look for ways to turn customer conversations into great anecdotes . <p> Keep an eye out for team members who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great turn of phrase or share the most unique customer details . These people are goldmines for generating interesting , engaging longform projects . <p> 3 . Implement strategies to capture customer feedback . <p> Testimonials provide a wealth of content talking points if you leverage them effectively . Sean D'Souza of Psycho Tactics recommends doing a Brain Audit to get inside your customers ' minds so you can tailor your marketing to them . <p> Copyblogger takes it a step further with probing questions about why customers bought certain products , what obstacles might have prevented them from buying , and what other uses they suggest for it . Such queries will give you rich , colorful details that are perfect for longform storytelling . <p> 4 . Formalize your process . <p> Once you have staff members looking for story ideas , you need a workflow for turning those tidbits into articles , blog posts , ebooks , and other materials . Establish a system for submitting and approving ideas , and have a clear breakdown of who is responsible for editing and publishing the content . BTW @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Be realistic and consistent . <p> If you 're a small startup with a limited marketing department , do n't commit to doing multi-faceted monthly features that you ca n't actually produce . Create content as often as you can while still maintaining the highest quality possible . This is where customer testimonials and anecdotes will come in handy , because your team can write great blog posts off of those in between larger releases . <h> Is Longform Storytelling Right for Your Business ? <p> Longform storytelling is n't just a must-have in your branding strategy . It 's also an incredible opportunity to take your tribe behind the scenes , showing them who you and your team really are . The time and energy it takes to build compelling stories and unique content experience pays off many times over , because people buy from brands they love . And the first step towards them falling in love is letting them get to know you . 50881 @qwx910881

" convey just how rapidly our digital landscape will soon change , and serve as a call-to-action for leaders within organizations to either shape up or ship out . Infused with humor , fascinating case studies , and personal anecdotes from Wright and Snook , Digital Sense is a compulsively readable tome encouraging readers to make use of their Experience Marketing Framework ( EMF ) by blending customer experience , social business strategy , and marketing technology . <h> The Four Personas <p> Since its always good to start a book with some character development , Digital Sense first introduces four typical personas that live within any organization : <p> Influencers : Dubbed " the masters of human persuasion " , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3% of the population falls into this category , and they command the energy in every room they 're in . <p> Amplifiers : These innately ambitious folks ( 10% of the population ) have what it takes to become Influencers , but they tend to be short-sighted and get frustrated . <p> Motivatables : The largest persona of the four ( 60% of humanity ) , these are the tried-and-true people pleasers , and are happy just blending in and staying in their comfort zone . <p> Zombies : 27% of the population , " combining Debby Downer with Negative Nancy " , these are the gossip-mongers and the poisonous leeches who will destroy your organization given the chance . Do n't  be offended by the name-calling , because if you 're reading this blog post , you 're definitely not a Zombie . <h> The Experience Marketing Framework <p> Once readers are armed with this segmentation , Wright and Snook walk through their Experience Marketing Framework , which is reasonably complex , but aims to help organizations deliver exceptional customer experience in a digital world . here 's a quick breakdown , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ piece of the framework probes you to take a closer look at your organization via many different exercises : persona mapping , understanding your competitive landscape via the BCG Matrix or Gartner Magic Quadrant , a market trend questionnaire , and more .

Conducting these exercises will get you to a place where you have the decisions made to put a plan in place . <p> Success ( Execution ) layer : This layer gives you the tools ( performance media tactics , audience/intelligence systems ) to implement the processes you need to meet those business objectives you stated in the Vision Layer on time and within your budget . <p> Next , the book introduces ways to apply their social @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and customer service initiatives , followed by their specific marketing technology ( MarTech ) recommendations . <h> Story Time <p> Digital Sense is at its strongest when it points to specific examples as encouragement to implement their methodologies , like the Mercer CandidateCare and Mercer Match services that emerged out of Mercers Innovation Hub , an initiative across the organization to encourage ideas . This story neatly summarizes how a company that was hardly on the cutting edge was able to innovate brilliantly by keeping customer experience at the forefront . <p> Digital Sense is specifically targeted to the decision makers of companies , but even those lower on their organizational totem pole will undoubtedly enjoy the wry and irreverent tone that Wright and Snook infuse with the clear , keen business sense they 've gleaned from their combined forty years of marketing experience . <p> One of my favorite funny lines was Snooks nickname for all of us in this digital age of opportunity : " ProSumerTribuDucers " .

@@101010422 @5210422/ <p> Let me start this post by stating the obviousthere is no shortage of articles and infographics out there that already present quantitative data on this very topic . But I have two problems with these resources : <p> They 're proclaiming a " best practice " based on general Twitter user data Yes , there is strength in quantitative numbers , but Tom ( your loyal customer who follows you on Twitter ) probably has very different Twitter habits than Dick ( a 40-year-old sports fanatic ) and Harry ( an 18 year-old who 's in love with Miley Cyrus ) . <h> Why not drill into the actual habits of your own following if we have the tools to do so ? <p> In any given week , I 'm advising new clients on how to best leverage social channels for content distribution . It would be easy to just throw out the so-called best practices and send them on their way . But I 'm also the one who analyzes the performance of their social media activities and has to explain why click-throughs are or are n't  coming . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the " social media expert " may come into question . I 'd rather cover my bases and try to at least take the " timing variable " out of the equation . <p> By " timing variable " , I 'm referring to the times in which you would tweet on any given day and the percentage of your following that might actually be online at that time to see it . There 's really no way for us to calculate what that percentage is , but to be conservative , I normally ballpark this at 5% or less . So , if you have 100 followers , only 5 people might actually see it . Now before you get depressed about that impression rate , remember that a tweet is free ( on the surface ) and companies pay millions in traditional advertising to get their message in front of 5% of their customers . <h> Determine Your Own Best Practice <p> Luckily , there are some solid tools out there that allow you to identify the optimal times when the majority of YOUR Twitter following is active , and provide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tweets the best chance of being seen by the largest possible percentage . Ready to create your own " best practice ? " <p> Tweriod is a simple application that will analyze your Twitter account , your tweets , your followers and their tweets to determine the best times for you to tweet . You can log in via your personal or company Twitter account and then Tweriod will initiate their analysis process . It may take a little while ( hours/days ) to get your results . Once received , their report ( shown below ) provides recommendations for when to tweet on weekends , Mondays and weekdays in general . If I were you , I 'd write these times down somewhere ( note my sticky note above ) so you can reference them at any time . <h> Step 2 : Connect to Buffer <p> Buffer has been around for a while , but I really took note when I started prescribing Tweriod for clients . Theyve done a nice job integrating with Tweriod ( green button above ) to create a seamless integration that sends Tweriods suggested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allows you to do two things : <p> Create a schedule of optimal tweet times <p> " Automagically " launch your tweets at those pre-determined times <p> Let me throw out an example that seems to come up a lot . Many companies do n't  have staff members dedicated to managing their social media efforts , so were often working with busy marketers , sales people or even executives who are now responsible for this task . They may only be able to dedicate two hours on Thursday mornings to social , and that day/time combo might not be optimal for when their Twitter following is online . <p> Buffer allows you to add tweets to your Buffer que , which then launches your tweets at your pre-determined times throughout the day or week . So if two hours on Thursday is all you have time for , but you should ideally be tweeting two times per weekday at 10:20 a.m. and 1:05 p.m. , then you can spend your two hours loading up 10 tweets into your Buffer que , which will then take care of your entire week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but its better than the alternative . <p> Technical Note : Buffer has done a nice job of creating plenty of bookmarklets , browser extensions , plugins and email-to-buffer tools , so you can que up tweets whenever and wherever you come across something good . I particularly like being able to email a tweet to my Buffer account when I 'm browsing Flipboard on my iPad at night . <h> A New Arrival <p> If you 're a Hootsuite user , they recently announced the launch of " AutoSchedule " a similar scheduling tool that might give Buffer some competition . <p> Though only available via their Hootlet browser extension ( which I use religiously ) , Hootsuites AutoSchedule utilizes a " smart algorithm " that will suggest and post your tweets at optimal times . On the surface , this looks very much like the Tweriod/Buffer combo , but I have n't seen any details or data to give me confidence in their " smart algorithm " as of yet . Again , I do n't  like having to work within the statistical parameters of the general public . Show me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <h> Fill Your Que with Goodness <p> While timing is an important factor in the Twitter game , the biggest factor is obviously the quality of your tweets . Promotion of great , original content and a targeted dose of content curation , delivered at the optimal time of day , might just be the new best practice to get your followers to start clicking . 50881 @qwx910881

By the end of the convention , revelers were saturated with knowledge , inspiration ( some , a little perspiration ) , and a broader network to help them conquer Higher Ed content strategy and marketing challenges . Here are some highlights from Atlanta . <h> Navigating Blurred Lines <p> From keynote speaker to breakout sessions , the term blurred lines was repeated . I think everyone in the room could relate to this term , and not just from the annoying images of Miley Cyrus grinding on Robin Thicke . No , the blurred lines term spoken about at Confab Higher Ed was a rallying cry everyone could relate to . Blurred lines was a testament to the many hats content marketers wear , the many departments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Blurred lines could be considered another line , a battle line . <p> All the speakers in attendance brought to our attention many ways to help navigate these battle lines . Dan Raoms " The Back of the Napkin : Explaining Complexity With Simple Pictures " painted a very clear picture of the necessity and usefulness of providing simple VISUALS to communicate with both internal stakeholders and external audiences . <p> Karen McGrane conveyed another battle line that content marketers in Higher Ed must face . The struggle to convey the importance of content marketing to school Presidents , Boards and committees is challenging enough for Higher Ed communications teams . Now the battle to get educational institutes to see the importance of mobile adaptation is an additional front . Karens " The Mobile Content Mandate in Higher Ed " reinforced the need for mobile-friendly websites and communications initiatives and gave statistics for Confab Higher Ed attendees to bring back to their schools . <h> Flipping the Bill <p> Helping to unblur the lines ( and sponsor the convention ) within Higher Ed content marketing are CMS providers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ production platforms . Something DivvyHQ took away from this event ourselves was mentioned in John EckmansCMS Myths in Higher Education . The question when exploring SaaS providers , and CMS platforms in particular , should not be what they can do . The questions that should be asked Can the platform match the production processes that our educational institutions already have in place ? Can it mold to our needs ? Not , can we mold to its capabilities . In Johns words , " Try to break it . " With SaaS , you can break and then not buy it . <h> Cats Over Kids <p> A personal observation This is the first convention where people showed me more pictures of their cats then of their kids . Why ? Because this is a content strategy and digital marketing convention and cats own the internet . It also demonstrates the youthfulness of the industry and should be a sign to educational Presidents and Boards . This IS the future . <h> Bill Murray <p> So Bill Murray was there .

What started as a joke picture of Sean Tubridy , Creative Manager of Brain Traffic who was photographing speakers at the event , snowballed into a convention-wide hashtag , that originally Sean was n't in on . I want to thank Sean again for his willingness to play along and to everyone who joined in on the fun . Here are some of our favorite " snaps " . <h> And Finally <p> As the last keynote speaker finished up and the process of cleaning up the DivvyHQ booth started , I took a chance to reflect on Confab Higher Ed 2013 .

" I do believe that content can have an impact on direct sales , but is that really the purpose of content marketing ? Numerous buyer behavior studies have shown us that the reasons people buy things have less to do with analytical , rational reasons and more to do with how the person feels emotionally about the product . How does this impact your content strategy ? <p> I would argue that the purpose of content is to create trust and credibility in a brand ; trust and credibility turn into sales . <p> Conversely , the purpose of advertising is to sell products .

Hurry ! Only a Few Left ! This messaging makes the buyer feel like they must hurry up and make a decision . This can often leave the person with remorse .

I keep wishing that GoDaddy would call me to discuss their content strategy . The half-naked GoDaddy Girls do n't  do them any favors with me and probably most of their female audience agrees . There 's just no reason for your content strategy to include " sexy . " These messages can only leave your audience feeling exploited , offended and just plain uncomfortable . Not the feeling we want our buying audience to have . There is no place for cleavage in content ( unless your Victorias Secret , I suppose ) . <p> What do you think ?

Many organizations may have separate compliance or governance team members that are tasked with ensuring the accuracy of any external content . This particular video post is a good example . I 'm providing a how-to video on the functionality of these key date settings , but this functionality may very well change in the coming months .

We can also jump ahead two months and see our review date . <p> Some of you may be thinking ( because we 've received several user questions about this ) that seeing all three of these instances might be a little confusing , especially for team members who do n't need to see each instance of the content item . Depending on the roles and responsibilities of your individual team members , it might be helpful to customize or remove some of - the dates that display on their individual calendars . <h> My Calendar Settings <p> The display of these key dates can be customized in your My Account settings . Scroll down to " My Calendar Settings " and each team member can adjust which dates are important for them to see . Here are a few examples @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a copywriter that creates blog content for you . They do n't need to see publish dates , promotion dates or review dates .

All they need to see is the promotion dates . They can check that , hit save and then they have a clean calendar view that only shows them what they need to see . <h> Thanks for watching this video and we hope it helps make your content management process , and your life , a little easier . 50881 @qwx910881

Back in late June , we handed one of our developers a large list of new , calendar-related feature requests . Then we locked him in a closet and told him not to come out until he s done . He finally emerged this past week ( looking a little pale ) , so we told him to head to the pool and well take it from here . <p> 2 . Headline Hover Want to see the details of a content item ? Just hover over the headline ! Thanks to customer feedback , this new features eliminates the need to click/view individual content items in order to see key details ( dates , content status , content owner , etc . ) . With the addition of this hover menu , content items can be marked as published right within the calendar view . To edit/view a content item , you can doubleclick the headline or click " Edit Item " from the hover menu . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Item to a Specific Day This is a nice little shortcut for those of you who want to directly input and schedule a content idea for a specific day . <p> 4 .

Toggle publish dates , production deadlines , promotion dates and review dates on or off as needed . No need to make adjustments on your My Account page . <p> If you have specific filters that you want applied each time you view your calendar , you can select them and click the " Set as Default " checkbox . <p> By pulling all existing filters into this new menu , weve uncluttered the header of our editorial calendar interface altogether . <p> 5 .

Any suggestions ? <p> Yeah , change is hard . I should probably write a blog post on this to provide you all with our point of view and what we 've learned from our customers . In the interim , what we 've seen have the most success is just to get started using Divvy with a small team that you manage ( and have some authority over ) .

Youll be more organized . Efficiencies in your production process @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truly like using a tool , they tend to talk about it .

They found us and started using Divvy with a small team of 10 . A month later , they called and wanted to add 20 more users . A month after that , they called again asking for 20 more users . They 're not " pushing " the platform on anyone , theyve just integrated it into their process and let success drive adoption . <p> One other comment I would make is that were working hard to make improvements that address some of these specific obstacles . One of which is a very nice mobile experience . As content producers ourselves , we also want to be able to easily make revisions to content right from our phones .

If you have one , you 're much more likely to be successful . We are 100% in that camp . But we also talk to large organizations every day that are so large , that actually going through a proper , company-wide strategy process is almost unfathomable . Oklets crawl before we walk . <p> A good way to ease into a better strategic position is to leverage a simplified strategic framework ( here 's a great one from Velocity Partners ) that can be used as a template to guide smaller strategy development meetings with individual teams , business units or regions .

Adoption crawls , seniority wins , and your shiny new platform falls by the wayside . You feel beyond frustrated that things will never change . <p> Sound familiar ? <p> I see this scenario on a frequent basis , and I can feel the frustration coming from that deflated champion that worked so hard to get to this point . While adoption of any new platform is going to be challenging for organizations , it sure seems like the adoption of content marketing platforms are a special beast to tame . But this challenge is not insurmountable . Here are some suggestions to keep your team on track to implement your new content marketing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the process early <p> Start by asking yourself this : who are the heavy hitters in your department who A ) have important content programs to manage , and B ) have a lot of influence . Getting these folks on board early in the process can have a HUGE impact on the potential future of a new platform . A conversation with these folks sets the tone that you are trying to find a new platform to help them . You need something better . They need something better . A new platform that meets everyones needs is a WIN ! <p> After having those conversations , you should setup demos for various platforms and invite them . Now here 's where it gets interesting . If they join you on the demos , you can probably conclude that their interesting in finding better solution is genuine . But if they decline the demos , this may be an indication that they were not really interested , which should be a red flag of potential resistance in the future . <h> 2 . Clearly define and communicate the " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is chaos , does n't  mean that everyone elses is too . There are plenty of folks out there who are nice and cozy , wrapped in their spreadsheet security blankets . But you are not one of them . And if a majority of your team ( and/or your managers ) are open to finding a better solution , then you should spend some time to make the case . here 's a good framework : <p> Why do we need this platform ? <p> What current , day-to-day issues are holding us back ? ( missing deadlines , missing opportunities due to reactive production , no visibility into what everyone is doing and progress of various initiatives , cant find anything due to lack of centralized storage , etc. ) <h> 3 . Enlist an executive ally <p> This is when the advantage of having seniority on your side will help . If you already have a senior-level mentor within your organization , enlist that seasoned employee to be your cheerleader throughout the implementation process . Theres strength in numbers , and the more folks you can convince of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you stand against any resistance . <p> I 'm constantly surprised by how many users pay for our Onboarding services and then do n't  use them ! Onboarding is an essential step in any successful SaaS implementation , and content marketing platforms are no exception . This process , often customized , will ensure you have a solid setup that mirrors the organization and current processes your team uses . With your onboarding coach leading your initial " train the trainer " sessions , you should be able to come up with a solid training program for your team members to nail down minimum usage requirements that should achieve those previously-identified benefits . <p> Even after the onboarding cycle is over , you will likely be able to continue to utilize their services to train new additions to your team later on . And , needless to say , make friends with the Support/Customer Success team . They will be your best friends as you work through any support or technical issues your new users will ( inevitably ) face . <h> 5 . Train resistant stakeholders with real content examples @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only so much value in us demonstrating functionality with dummy content . Working with real-world content examples helps producers remember their typical workflow and then helps them visualize and get comfortable with how that workflow will change ( for the better ) . A little hand-holding goes a long way here , and concrete examples will help your resistant team members be better able to visualize real results . <h> 6 . Feedback , Feedback , Feedback ! <p> Your feedback ( reporting issues , new feature suggestions , etc. ) is vital to the success of your implementation , and will only improve your and your team members experience . Constantly engaging with either your account rep or the Customer Success team , and encouraging your fellow team members to do the same , will help solidify your usage of the platform . Hidden perks may also emerge , too , if you set yourself apart as a true " power user " of the platform . We love getting feedback from our users , and take it seriously to improve their experience . <h> I have your back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to implement a new content marketing platform , its important to know that you are n't  alone , and have a whole team ( or several teams ! ) of folks behind you to ensure it happens . Plan on setting a schedule of consistent stakeholder checkins for at least the first 90 days , to ask questions like " How is this implementation process going ? " and " What hoops do we really need to focus on jumping through ?

And HEY LOOK ! There 's a bunch of cool-looking content marketing platforms- out there that will rescue us ! ! ! - Herein lies the problem . <h> What type of content marketing platform- DO- you need ? <p> The short answer is " It depends " . - There are several variables to consider when a company is looking at software to manage their content marketing . Variables may include things like : <p> Size and structure of a content team- Solo-to-small-ish teams may be able to get by with less-sophisticated tools like Excel or Google Drive ( **25;56;TOOLONG ) to manage their process . But as teams grow , these solutions get cumbersome and inefficiencies start to thwart output . We 've outlined the pitfalls of spreadsheet-based solutions here . Large organizations that often have multiple departments/teams contributing to content marketing should look at more robust content marketing platforms ( DivvyHQ , Kapost , others ) that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tools and CMS-backed platforms that become the centralized repository for all content created across an organization . These platforms can significantly increase efficiency and output , as well as improve collaboration and content quality . <p> Volume of Content- Along the same lines as above , lower volumes of content typically equate to smaller levels of " process pain " , so organizations that do n't  create a lot of content can get by with less-sophisticated solutions ( Excel , task management systems ) . As the volume increases , pain levels increase and getting content planned , produced and published efficiently becomes a real challenge . High-volume content teams need well-defined workflow processes and a software tool needs to be customizable and mold to those processes . <p> Types of Content and Distribution Channels- When evaluating software platforms , its important to consider the different types of content that your organization needs to produce and through which channels that content will be published/distributed . For example , B2C organizations may focus heavily on social and visual content , and thus a solution like Percolate may be ideal . B2B @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ebooks , webinars ) , and thus solutions like DivvyHQ or Kapost may be a better fit . And lets- not forget about all the other types of content that are produced inside of your organization .

Feeding intranets and internal social- networks take- just as much planning and process efficiency as external channels . Just imagineexternal comms and internal comms sharing assets and collaborating efficiently ! <h> Beware of- Generals- and Swiss Army Knives <p> A few words of caution as you 're narrowing down your platform options Beware of " generals " , as in general/generic project management systems that are n't  tailored for managing the unique aspects of content strategy and content marketing . They simply do n't  have content-centric workflows and native fields that are vital for managing this very unique process . <p> Also be careful with " swiss army knives " , the platforms that claim they can do EVERYTHING , but do nothing well .

Which parts- of your- process are the most painful ? Where are you really struggling ? - Before you start spending valuable dollars and time on platforms- that may not be the most efficient or effective , take time to consider the above variables- and discuss with your key stakeholders .

I confess I 'm not a big baseball fan , maybe I need better seats . Anyway , I know the All-Start Game was played last night because it was held in our home town of Kansas City , Mo . This town has been All-Star crazy for weeks in anticipation of this game . They even colored the water in all our fountains blue ! <p> In all this frenzy , I 've been forced to think about the make-up of this All-Star roster . As I understand it , fans choose the best of the best players from across all of the major league to fill each of the nine field positions . And , as stated in a Bleacher Report headline , " which team has the most lethal lineup ? " It seems , that in this all-important game , the team with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a mile . <h> What would happen if we approached stacking our editorial team bench with this same philosphy ? <p> When I speak at conferences , I like to pull up a slide that shows audience members ( generally marketers ) what the organizational chart of a real publishing department looks like . What roles they have and the responsibilities of these key players . Then , we go through an excercise of adapting this kind of editorial team structure to audience members organizations . This structure looks a little different depending on the kind of organization you have , i.e. , agency , corporation , small business , etc . This is a really helpful activity for most audience members who have been fed the " we must learn to be publishers now " philosophy , but have really been given no basis for how to actually put this methodology into practice within their four walls . <h> So what does editorial team structure have to do with baseball ? <p> Well , let me ask you a question . Do you have your " field " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organization ? Or are there some significant holes in your lineup ? - I would say your organization has relatively the same goal as the two All-Star teams to beat your competition . You probably also know how well you stack up to your competitors their strengths , weaknesses , advantages , key players , etc . Knowing your opponents can help you put your strongest players on your bench . <h> Here are a few key positions where you need to have your strongest players : <p> Editor ( Your Pitcher ) : A good editor can be the difference between good content and unforgettable content . Find a great editor ( you probably have on on staff ) who will make headlines stronger , stories tighter , angles better and properly manage the game . <p> Proofreader ( Your Catcher ) : These people are like gold in your production process , catching all the mistakes and making little adjustment that make your content better . When you find a good one , hold on to them for dear life . They should ALWAYS be the final step @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Your Heavy Hitters ) : Engineers , Clients , Doctors and Scientists are the ones you need to be bringing to the table when you 're doing your editorial planning . These people hold all the juicy stuff when it comes to valuable content . Make sure they are invited to the brainstorming table and work on pulling out ideas from them about what they 're passionate about and then work them into the production process . <p> C-Suite ( Your General Manager ) : Do n't  let your CEO hide - in the duggout . She knows a lot about the market you 're in , competitive environments , the companys story ( the real one ) , what 's next for your company and your vision . These are all things that great content is made of , especially in our era of complete corporate transparency . Do short interviews to get the info , or better yet , add her to the editorial calendar . She may be surprised and excited about the opportunity . <p> Sales/Field Reps ( Your Infield Players ) : These people are the closest to your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the table to hear stories , experiences and frustrations from your customer base .

If you 've been in the marketing game a while , youve probably stumbled upon plenty of articles from disgruntled marketers proclaiming that physical events just do n't  have as much bang as they used to . Phooey . They 're not doing it right . <p> We love attending and exhibiting at industry conferences and there 's no question that the return outweighs the investment . So in an effort to " drink our own Kool-Aid " ( and give myself a refresher ) , I thought this might be a good opportunity to provide you with some of our personal best practices that we 've used for years to squeeze every last drop of relationship-building goodness out of your tradeshow/conference participation . <h> DivvyHQs 10 Pre-show , On-site and Post-show Promotional Tips <h> Pre-Show <p> 1 . Work the Social Angles Check out the conference website and look for their existing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ properties/communities ( FB page , LinkedIn groups , community forums , etc. ) , look for ways to join in the conversation . Do n't  be scared to " put it out there " that you will be at the show and looking forward to connecting with folks who fit your ( buyer ) profiles . <p> 2. #SocialButterfly Find out the official Twitter/Facebook hashtag for the show . Start monitoring that and contributing to the stream of conversation . Put your social butterfly hat on and meet as many people ( virtually ) as you can before the show . Offer to meet people for coffee , lunch , dinner or an adult beverage after the show . Set up meetings or personal demos if applicable . <p> Important noteSince you might be meeting these people in person , it is best to facilitate this engagement through the personal Twitter/Facebook profile of the staff member(s) that will be attending the event . Do n't  do all this via a generic brand page or Twitter account . But make sure your personal bio ties directly back to your company ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3 . Customer Meetups At a minimum , make sure to tell your customers ( in some fashion ) that you 're going to be attending certain shows . ( Divvy customers , see the bottom of this post ) . Face-time with customers at events can really build loyalty , so make yourselves available and make that time productive ( impromptu focus group , video testimonial ? ) . <p> 4 . Prep &amp; Promote a " Show-Only Deal " If your product or service lends itself , figure out some sort of special offer that will be available only to attendees . Tease the offer in any pre-show promos or sponsor ads that are often included with your exhibitor/sponsor package . <h> During the Show <p> 5 . Tweet Away , Merrill You can hit some serious home runs by using Twitter for real-time engagement at a conference . I typically use a corporate twitter account to tweet interesting insights gleaned from speakers/sessions . Then I use my personal account to retweet and reply to interesting nuggets that others have tweeted . Do n't  forget to use the shows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of high-quality , insightful tweets from both personal and corporate twitter accounts throughout the show , you 'll get a nice bump in both new followers , corporate brand awareness and people wanting to connect with you/your staff physically . <p> 6 . Photos ( and now video ) ! This is definitely the one that our team needs to improve upon . Its never been easier to grab your phone and capture the experience of the show with photos and video via Instagram . Use the show hashtag ( or find out if the show/organization has a specific Instagram hashtag ) and post the photos to both Twitter and to your corporate FB page . All this acts as great , visual , behind-the-scenes content . If you take pictures with other attendees , tag/mention them . <p> 7 . Download " Evernote Hello " App for iPhone/Android If you 're really " working " a show , you 'll inevitably start to amass a large stack of business cards ( badge scanners do n't  count ) . And if you 're not a dedicated sales person , the size of the stack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people . Kinda counterintuitive . Instead , use Evernote Hello , a really cool app that not only allows you to photo scan the cards and capture their contact info , but it also automagically emails that person your contact info and sends them a LinkedIn connection request . Trust meWhen you do this during the show as you 're meeting people , they will remember you and theyll be uber-impressed with your tech-savviness . <h> Post-Show <p> 8 . Follow-Up While Its Fresh Immediately follow up on any noteworthy opportunities as soon as you get back in the office . Go through your list of business cards and connect with anyone ( via social ) that you might have missed . If you use Google Apps/Gmail for email , leverage the Rapportive extension to locate each contacts social accounts simply by entering in their email address . This engages Rapportives API connections , shows you all of their social profiles and you can connect with them right within Gmail . <p> 9 . Post-show Promotions Is there a promotion that you can provide to show connections or attendees ? If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marketing platform and get an email out . Do n't  let too much time pass . Theyll forget about you if you wait too long . <p> 10 . Do a Show Recap Blog Post These days , its pretty common to see companies live-blogging and/or live-tweeting during a conference . If you have the staff that can crank out good play-by-play , by all means , do it . If not , at least try to get a solid blog post up a day or two after the show that recaps key learnings , funny stories or fun photos/videos from the show . Event organizers will often find these posts and give you some love via their social properties , which never hurts ! <h> My Promise 50881 @qwx910881

Some of you may have read that and thought , " Brody , you 're crazy . Were not about to give away the internal , secret sauce that sets us apart from our competitors . " <p> Ok . I get it . Youve been developing and perfecting those processes and technologies for years and you 've always kept your recipe close to the vest . But let me ask a simple questionDo you think Emeril would have ever become a household name if he had n't  given away ( and packaged ) his recipes , expertise and secret sauce ? BAM ! <h> A Personal Experience with Giving Away the Farm <p> Back in my corporate marketing days , I worked for a company that manufactures mini , wastewater treatment plants for single-family homes and communities who have no access to centralized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the internal workings and components of the treatment process , there was always a big fear that competitors would knock off the design of the product . <p> With this fear ever-present , it was challenging for me to create marketing materials for these products , especially considering that we were often selling to engineers who are naturally curious as to how things work . To make it even harder to do business with us , we would force prospects to qualify themselves before we handed over CAD drawings that would allow them to integrate our product into their wastewater system designs . If not for personal relationships and the 40-50 tradeshows at which we exhibited each year , I 'm not sure how we stayed afloat . <p> But the time soon came that we needed to revamp our website . An internal team of sales , marketing and customer service staff ( myself included ) got together and put some major pressure on our executive staff to loosen the vest and allow us to make all our CAD drawings available for download on the new site ( no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same time , we had started to do a lot of business overseas and the language barrier was creating some major obstacles . We pitched the development of 3D animations that would dive deep into the muck and show both foreign and domestic engineers how these products really work . They said yes to that too . Evidently we picked the right day to pitch all that . <h> The Rationale <p> Despite having proprietary , even secretive , processes or technologies , your competition still has to have the resources , time and expertise to knock you off . Most do n't  . And if you 've done a good job of marketing your offering , you 'll likely be so far ahead in the game that a knock-off product or service wont matter . If/when marketed properly , the benefits of sharing your secret sauce almost always outweighs the risks . <h> The Results <p> With the availability of both engineering drawings and great animations that showed all the gooey details , there were no more obstacles in the way of getting our treatment products specified into thousands of wastewater @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2012 ) , my former boss traveled to Washington D.C. to accept the Presidents " E " Award for outstanding achievement in exports from the U.S. Commerce Secretary , John Bryson . They were also featured on the JumboTron at Times Square in NYC . That award is one of the highest recognitions any U.S. entity can receive for exporting . In a nutshell , they 're killing it . <h> My Advice <p> Start by thinking about your buyers and get a clear understanding of how much detail they need to properly understand and evaluate your solution . If you have proprietary processes or technologies , try to find out where that " line " is located that , when crossed , raises red flags . Then create/provide content that walks right up to that line . If prospects are asking for more , they 're probably ready for a personal tour of your farm . <p> Have you fought this internal battle before ? Were you successful ?

This was DivvyHQ 's first Big Omaha , and it was invigorating to spend time with such creative , fearless people . Being the content nerd I am , I could n't help but take notice of the brand messaging and digital content that these smart startups are producing . Here are a few insights that stuck with me . <h> A " Do or Die " Content Strategy ? <p> Content is important and necessary for every size of business , and in every industry . But perhaps there 's no content more important than to a startup organization . If you work for a larger , seasoned company , you can take a few risks with your content , try things and see where it goes . If it does n't work , - scrap it and try something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from scratch and everything you create must be carefully crafted in a way that people will not only take notice , but fall in love with your brand and quickly . You do n't have the time or money to try things that do n't work . Every piece of content you produce tells people who you are and what you 're about , and for startups , you often do n't get a 2nd chance . You could say , the startup organization content strategy is " do well or die . " <p> Wait a minutethats a great content strategy for ANY size company ! What if your organization , large or small , old or new , took a do-or-die approach to your content strategy ? <p> What if every piece of content you produced could make or break your company ? <p> I would bet you would plan your content more thoughtfully , understand your audience more fully and pay more attention to how well each piece is produced . Maybe we should all put ourselves in that mindset , no matter how big , small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Startup <p> 1 . Carefully and Thoughtfully Craft Your Brand Message This is very important , and startup organizations are getting pretty good at this . They sit down and hash out their story , their purpose for existence and the 1-3 things they want their audience to know about them . Then , they meticulously craft every word of their tag lines , news releases and website copy so that every word conveys their brand value . And yes , we once got into it over whether to use the word , " the . " To a startup , the message matters just as much as the product . Get that right , and the rest gets easier . A great example of a thoughtfully crafted brand message is F*** Cancer . I met them at Big Omaha . This non-profit startup from Canada has their brand value and message down patand its a pretty easy message to remember . A great piece of advice from their CEO , Yael Cohen was " keep your message simple and concise . " Yeah , I think she did that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Do n't Worry About Anyone Else When you talk to a startup organization and ask them who they 're targeting , theyll not only know , but they will then talk to you for an hour and and half about them . Startups understand their market , they know what value they hold with their market , and they know what to say to them . You could say that a startup organization is pretty much obsessed with their audience . They survey , research , and in some cases , stalk their audience online . This is a great mentality for every business to have . Another group that we met at Big Omaha was Thrillist Media Group . See if you can tell who their target audience is just by going to the home pagehint its not old ladies . Thrillist definitely knows who they 're targeting , what they want and how to deliver it . <p> 3 . Get Creative and Make it Stand Out from the Noise Startups know that going into it , unless they 're creating a new category , they 're going to be up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Startup organizations understand that they wont be able to compete with budgets , resources and presence , so they compete with different . I cant think of a better example of this than the startup , Dollar Shave Club . The industry is disposable razors . I can think of a few major competitors and a universe of smaller ones . Not really a category that you can just sneak into and hope people notice you . Well that 's not what this company did . They decided to compete based on a clear value proposition and their ability to be different . If you have n't seen their launch video , go watch it now . Youll be inspired to think about ways you can make your content compete by being different , not by being better/bigger . <p> 4 . Listen First , Then Speak Startup organization tend to go into business , not with answers , but armed with a million questions . They question everything . Why this product and not that ? How do you use this product ? What makes you like this over that ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them to listen . I believe that listening to your target audience is what will make or break your company . People will forgive a lot of things if they feel like someone on the other end cares about their needs . Trust us , we know . We have some of the most forgiving users , ever ! Startups know that the more they listen , the better their product/service will be and the more in-tune theyll be with their audience ( see #2 ) . Organizations of all sizes could take a page out of this book . Most companies do the opposite , spending most of their time filling the pipeline with stuff they want to say , as opposed to filling it with stuff their customers want to hear . A great example of a startup doing more listening and less talking are our friends , AgLocal . AgLocal has yet to go live with their application , but theyve spent the past 8 months listening to their potential users and farmers about what they want . Once they do launch , theyll already have the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ build it . Genius . You may already be " built , " but never the less , you can always include more " listening " activities into your content planning . <p> 5 . There 's No Time to Waste on Useless Content . Every Piece Needs to Help Build your Brand This is a big one for the startup crowd . Time is the only thing a lot of these entrepreneurs have to give , so every minute must be spent on activities that will move the business forward . This is a great lesson for organizations of all sizes . Every piece they produce ties in their brand value and main message and is in line with their strategy and voice and targeted to their audience . Imagine what that kind of focus could do for your organizations content . I love everything that this startup gal , Princess Lasertron , does . She knows her brand , loves her brand and lives her brand in every piece of content she writes . Plus , she always has on really cool shoes . 
@@101010538 @5210538/ <p> A few days back , one of our account execs was onboarding a new customer and he was asked about why we do n't  allow a content item to have multiple content types . The short answer isYou shouldnt use the exact same content for multiple channels . So were not going to let you . <h> here 's Why <p> Let 's say you have a great story idea . Once written , this story would be ideally packaged and distributed as a blog post , an email and a press release . If you were to create this piece and publish it word-for-word via all three channels , then you 're not being smart about the differences in those channels , and the audiences who value those channels . Using my example , here are a few typical differences between these three content channels for which I would account : <p> The Blog Post I would start with this as the full content , the full story . I would keyword optimize the headline/title . I would create and include graphics/photos to support the story . I would write @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ audience(s) in mind . I would end the story with a call to action or call for feedback . <p> The Email Using the blog post as a reference , I would summarize the content down to a teaser that only includes one or two main points . My chosen points would be those that are most valuable to my email subscribers ( the list that I will send to ) . If they want more , they need to click a strong call-to-action ( a big button ) . I 'd write an enticing , personalized headline . I would limit photos to only one or two ( a banner ) . <p> The Press Release Again using the blog post as a reference , I would create a more formal , news-oriented headline . I would dial back the conversational tone of the content a bit . I would- make sure the first paragraph summarizes the entire story for industry **26;83;TOOLONG , who may be scanning hundreds of stories that day . I would include backlinks to our website/product/service pages . I would choose the best photo to attach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these three content items would be very different . Marketers need to understand these differences and be thoughtful of not only what they put out , but who is on the other end of that channel . Similar differences could be cited for sharing a status update on Facebook , Twitter and LinkedInvery different audiences . The same 140 characters published on all three wont do you any favors . <h> DivvyHQ Reporting Considerations <p> On the Divvy side specifically , we are working on building out our reporting dashboard that will track the content output for each user , each calendar and certainly each CONTENT TYPE . If you take the shortcut of creating one content item , but publish it to multiple channels , your future output reports wont be accurate . <p> I 'm assuming that you want an accurate picture of how many blog posts , emails and press releases you actually produced and published . Is that a safe assumption ? Hence we 've built a simple " Duplicate " function that allows you to create that base blog post and then duplicate it to tailor each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . <h> Make sense ?

I was a little surprised when one of the ladies said , " I hate PinterestIt makes me feel like a bad mom . " <p> When you consider the crafty , uber-creative and foodielicious folks that contribute much of the content , I guess I can kinda see where she 's coming from . But if you are considering Pinterest as a new channel for your company , its important to get in the heads of your target buyers and make sure your overall strategy compliments your brand , and does n't  come with unintended side effects . <h> What Should Your Pinterest Strategy Look Like ? <p> Most of us are still experimenting with different strategies , and it 's nice to have several different clients that are on board with being our guinea pigs . Here are six different approaches with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One of our clients is a commercial printing company that targets graphic designers and creative directors within marketing/ad agencies . Designers are always looking for inspiration , so they 're creating Pinterest boards based on the different types of print materials ( a brochure board , identity board , etc. ) that they can print . We 're having them not only pin their own portfolio pieces , but also curate unique and innovative pieces that might inspire the designers they 're targeting . <p> Think Outside of Your Products/Services " We 're working with a specialty grocery store that targets foodies . Instead of just focusing on their food products , we 're having them create boards with cool kitchens , innovative cooking tools/utensils , bar accessories , table settings and servingware . <p> Pull Back the Curtain " A customer in the oil/gas industry is shooting and pinning behind-the-scenes photos to show their operation and community involvement .

The online world is already full of " content pollution " and direct promotion of your content via your Pinterest account will probably not result in much action unless you 've already amassed a huge following . For example , I personally pinned our infographic on the " 12 Things to Do After Youve Written a New Blog Post " , but did n't  get squat for repins or referral traffic . We did however get thousands of repins and referral visits based on other people ( with large Pinterest followings ) pinning it .

@@101010561 @5210561/ <p> As a marketer or content practitioner , youve probably been using various types of templates throughout your career . But perhaps you 're trying to learn and tame the new animal that is content marketing , and not aware of how the content marketing process can be successfully templatized . That 's the subject of this series , and if you 're just joining us , you should check out last weeks post ( link below ) where I walked through a myriad of content marketing templates that can be used during the up-front strategy phase of the content marketing process . <h> Part 2 : Templatize Your Processes &amp; Workflows <p> Using templates within any industrial process normally results in speed , quality and efficiency improvements . Three areas where templates can deliver efficiencies in the content marketing process include content ideation , planning and content production workflows ( how individual content items should be produced , edited , approved and published ) . <h> Content Ideation <p> On the ideation side , weve all probably experienced the sometimes-fun , sometimes-dreaded brainstorming meeting . These can be valuable if facilitated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respond to meeting requests . Hence we created the Parking Lot in DivvyHQ that provides a repository for ideas , and ideas can be added whenever inspiration strikes . <p> Its also useful to create or find a tool that enables employees to submit ideas ( or requests ) by filling out a shared form or content brief . This process can be templatized across business units to create an endless flow of new ideas . For a great content brief template , check out this article by our friends at Velocity Partners . <h> Content Planning <p> I realize that the thought of having more meetings is nauseating , but holding a regular editorial planning meeting is critical for content marketing success . Regular ( weekly ? ) content planning meetings ensure that you are proactively looking ahead and maintaining a consistent schedule of new content for your marketing properties/channels . In the traditional publishing world , these meetings often happen daily , but todays marketing departments need to think of themselves as publishers and get on board with a consistent editorial planning schedule . <p> To help facilitate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agenda template that is designed to set expectations for what will be covered in the meeting , what attendees should have prepared for the meeting , and provide some prompts for brainstorming new ideas that align with your content strategy . The downloadable meeting agenda template can be tailored to your specific needs . <h> Production Workflows <p> As marketers and communications teams take on more and more content channels , properties and initiatives , the shear volume of content to produce can get overwhelming quickly . The result ? Missed deadlines and inconsistent publishing frequency . <p> Imagine this You have a favorite magazine that you crave . For years , it has hit your mailbox on the same day every month . You cant wait to get your hands on this months issue and you open your mailbox its not there . WTF ? In the publishing world , that 's unacceptable . We , as content marketers , should have that same mentality . But how do you ensure deadlines do n't  get missed and your publishing schedule is consistent ?

To dig into this more , Robert Mills of GatherContent recently wrote a great post on defining your production workflow for the Content Marketing Institute . <h> Workflow Templates in DivvyHQ <h> Part 3 Preview <p> Next week , well dig into various content marketing template examples for different content formats that you probably produce regularly , like blog posts , case studies or website landing pages .

@@101010562 @5210562/ <h> The Simple Black Dress of Content Marketing <p> When I was 17 , a wonderful mentor who had traveled the globe for the fashion industry gave me two important pieces of advice . First she said that I 'll never go wrong wearing the color black . Then she said , before I leave for any event , I should look in the mirror and remove one or two pieces of jewelry that were the most obvious in order to keep the look simple . Huh ? But why ? I loved that necklace AND those fab earrings AND the coordinating bracelet and I wanted to wear them all together . Her answer was simple <p> " Do n't  wear anything that could take attention away from the important conversations you want to have . Its distracting to you and to the person you 're talking to . " <h> Oh My <p> This rule of thumb has followed me ever since and it has always been the best advice . My wardrobe is nearly entirely black and I 've invested in several high-quality pieces that I can add to as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day or before any event I remove one or two pieces of jewelry that could take away from important conversations I want to have . After all , I do n't  want to waste time discussing where I got my cute earrings , I would rather make the other person the focus so that I can learn a thing or two ! <h> How does this apply to Content Marketing ? <p> Content Marketing is the foundation of modern and important " conversations " that we , as marketers , want to have . By focusing on who we want to have conversations with , and engaging them in a myriad of places , we need to be constantly creating and re-purposing enticing and meaningful content that is pushed where we need it to be with good timing . But how do we do all of this ? How do we cultivate these meaningful , well-timed conversations when our desired audiences are distracted by the blinding crystals emblazoned on our theoretical tiaras ? <p> We cant . <p> Because Content Marketing is n't about us , its about them . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and want answers now . The best we can do is be there to offer help where its needed ( and we can all agree that meaningful help is wanted and is only given by listening to what people need help with and offering it in a timely fashion ) . <p> This is where the polyester hits the road . A thoughtful content marketing strategy , executed by a well-informed creative team ( equipped with the right tools ) , can become that force that attracts meaningful conversations . The right strategy and technology allows us to focus and create quality content for an attentive audience who want to be part of a conversation with us . <p> But we must have a plan that is visible and executable by our team . We need to know who were trying to speak to , and why they would be attracted to us . We need to devise our own best practices by listening to the feedback we receive from those audiences , in the places we are speaking to them . And we need to be consistent in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we reach . <h> Keep it Simple <p> In my experience , the only way this gets done effectively is by keeping things simple and efficient . Complex strategies and processes are like an elaborate outfit that took way too long to assemble , and made you late for the party . And extensive , enterprise software suites with too many accessories often get in the way of the simple conversations that we want to have . <p> I think its safe to say that we cant ever have enough meaningful conversations with those who impact our business . Do n't  get caught up with complexities that may distract you from doing what is most importantcreating meaningful content that starts conversations . That is the simple black dress we all truly crave . <p> Jenni is a Regional Account Manager for DivvyHQ .

The recent launch of CAT ( Content Analysis Tool ) immediately caught our attention , so we wanted to get Paula Land , co-creator of CAT , on here to give you a proper introduction . <h> The New CAT on the Block <p> Whether you are managing your own website or in the business of creating and delivering sites for clients , youve probably conducted a content inventory and audit to assess the current state of your content . And you may have struggled with the available tools and the sheer volume of data associated with even a moderately-sized site . It is typical to spend days and even weeks on the data gathering and organizing process . And that 's before you even begin doing the work of the actual content audit . <p> Although there 's no getting around the fact that inventorying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ built a new tool that helps you accelerate the process of gathering all that information and starting to make sense of it all . <p> The Content Analysis Tool ( CAT ) , from Content Insight , has just launched . CAT is designed to speed up the process of creating inventories and audits and present the data in a way that 's easier to interact with . CAT consists of a crawling engine , accessible from a Job Setup interface , from which you configure your crawl . You can include or exclude patterns of links , which allows for fine-grained control of the results . For example , if your site includes a number of sub-domains , you may want them included along with your base URL so you get the complete picture . On the other hand , if you 're auditing a specific section of the site and want to focus in on just those pages , you can restrict the crawl to that particular section 's URL structure . If you happen to be a whiz with regular expressions , you can get even more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ completed , the results are presented in a Dashboard view ( shown above ) , which provides a summary list of the counts of files , by type , and a complete list of all the files found . You can filter the results by file type or status or sort and view the results by URL , type , level , date , or title . In this view you can export the results ( a . csv file is generated ) or drill down into a detailed view of each page 's data ( shown below ) , including the metadata for the page ( title , description , keywords ) ; lists of all the images , media files , and documents associated with the page ( click to open and view any of the files in the list ) , lists of all the links in and out of each page , and , even a screenshot of the page ( an option that you choose in job setup ) . <h> From Data Analysis to Content Analysis <p> Content inventories are usually considered the quantitative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a list of files , which is then organized and supplemented to create the audit , the qualitative analysis . Using CAT , the line between the quantitative and qualitative starts to blur . It allows you to move more quickly and seamlessly from the data analysis part of the project to the actual content analysis . <p> Among the insights that can be gained about the content using CAT data : URLs and metadata allow you to evaluate whether the site is search engine friendly . Page titles allow you to identify duplicate page titles , which can be a search issue as well as an indication of duplicate content . Links in and out show the connections between content and help surface discoverability issues . Lists of documents help you see if the site relies heavily on non-indexable content , such as PDFs . <p> Using a tool like CAT to automate the inventory not only speeds up the actual data gathering process , but by including information about the pages themselves , it helps you move more quickly into the audit process and on to strategy development @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a migration project , the inventory also plays a key role . Many sites are constructed from a variety of sources " a content management system ( or two ! ) , databases , ecommerce engines , and so on . So the only way to have a complete list of all the pages that are currently served up to end users is to scan the live site . <p> Using a CAT-created inventory , you can track all the pages , as well as all of the images , documents , and media files that need to be migrated , helping ensure that you do n't miss key files during the migration . The lists of links in and out help you track what links may be broken if pages are moved or removed , so you can accurately configure your redirects . <p> CAT also has a job comparison feature , which allows you to rerun and compare two jobs , listing all the files that have been added , deleted , or changed from crawl to crawl .

Certainly names like Seth Godin , Brian Solis and Avinash Kaushik come to mind within the marketing , social and analytics realms ( respectively ) . On the company side of the coin , such organizations as Razorfish , Marketing Profs , Brain Traffic and Eloqua have made significant contributions that are helping to push the marketing industry forward . <p> Now let me ask you a questionDo you think any of these people or organizations are struggling to grow their businesses ? The short answer is no . The medium-sized answer is that they probably have more business and opportunities than they can handle , so they get to pick and choose who they WANT to work with and are in complete control of their growth . I do n't  know about you , but that 's certainly where I want to be . <h> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ step outside of the thick , congested air of the marketing world . Can you name the people or organizations who are leading the charge in your industry or niche ? Think beyond the 800 lb. gorillas . In all reality , many big companies are much more like 800 lb. dinosaurs . Think beyond the trade organizations that house and package the best of your industry . For the purposes of this blog post , they do n't  count . Who within your industry is communicating original thoughts , asking ( and answering ) the tough questions , controlling the conversation online , doing new research and publishing all kinds of original content , all for the betterment of your industry ? When we look at the things that todays emerging thought leaders are doing , these activities show up almost every time .

Secondly , does a thought leadership position jive with the overall goals and objectives of your organization ? If you 're a startup tech company looking to create a product and sell it in 12 months , this strategy is probably not a good fit . Lastly , you need C-level buy-in . This is a big , strategic decision and you 're going to need a variety of resources ( people , time , money ) to get it done . If they do n't  " get it " , then move on . <h> A 7-Step Tactical Model <p> So Ive kept my eye on many of todays emerging thought leaders and it does n't  take a brain surgeon to dissect the tactical activities that have helped these organizations solidify their positions in their respective industries . Outside of writing a book on your industry niche ( also recommended ) , here 's the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Original Research Whether you commission a research project through a research firm , or you do your own internal research project ( customer surveys , focus groups , etc ) , a quality , relevant research project is where it begins .

Look Ahead Good search engine rankings do n't  happen overnight , so its good to start this process by looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Are there seasonal trends to consider ? Do you have new products/services that you 'll be launching ? Do you have specific campaigns that you 're planning ? These considerations should start to frame your SEO strategy and help you determine the specific topics , product/service categories or keyword themes that you need to start researching . <p> 2 . Find the Money Terms/Phrases Once you 've nailed down your categories or themes , plug those general terms or phrases into Googles keyword research tool . In the " Keyword Ideas " section of the report , note the variations of your phrase and the additional words or " qualifiers " that may need to be considered . Note the monthly search volumes and the overall competitiveness of each phrase . Select and export your initial list of phrases and save it for step 3 . <p> 3 .

By looking at your cars dashboard , you can see that you 're going 60 mph , you have plenty of gas , no warning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you roll down your window and you see your competitors flying past you at 100 mph . <p> Establishing your baselines and then evaluating the competitive landscape ( content quality , internal and external links , etc. ) is crucial so you can see the opportunities in front of you , determine how high you need to climb , or realize that you might need to pick a different hill . To get your current ranking for any particular phrase , there 's a nice free ranking checker at SEOCentro.com ( example report below ) . <p> 4 . Plan &amp; Produce Your Content At this point , you have a list of keywords . Youve seen the quality and characteristics of the webpages ahead of you . Time to get planning . Sit down with your team , pick your target keywords and determine how you will create and package content that addresses those topics . Think website content , blog posts , ebooks , infographics , videos , podcasts , press releases and social promotion . Factor in seasonality , new product/service launches or promotional campaigns . Fill up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 5 . Optimize Your Output Another thing that has n't  changed a lot in the last few years are the on-page SEO basics . Naturally work in your target phrases into URLs , page titles , meta descriptions , heading tags , alt tags , anchor text and general page content . <p> 6 . Evaluate Your Progress After a month or two , I 'm always interested to see how the new content has helped elevate our stature . A good way to do this is via Google Analytics . NOTE : In order to generate the report below , you need to make sure you have connected your sites Google Webmaster Tools profile to your sites Google Analytics profile . Once that connection has been made , you should now be able to view your " Queries " report under Traffic Sources &gt; Search Engine Optimization &gt; Queries .

Clicking a content item on the Divvy calendar takes you directly into a CMS-like production environment that allows you to : <p> Move a content item through your unique production workflow and approval process . <p> The Divvy Parking Lot Google @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ area for content ideas that have yet to be scheduled or assigned . The Divvy Parking Lot gives you and your team the ability to capture content ideas when inspiration strikes and store them for review at your next content planning meeting . <p> Campaign Management How in the world would you even start to manage a large , multi-channel content campaign in a generic calendar application ? This is cake with Divvy . Create your campaign , assign the myriad of content assets to it and track the entire campaign all in one place . <p> Reporting Need to pull a report of all the content you created ( across all your content channels ) for a certain target audience ? No problem . Want to do a quick gap analysis regarding how many times you 've covered a certain topic in the last year ? That report is a few clicks away . None of that is possible in Google Calendar or Outlook . <p> The Cost Most of us love and respect Google for the amazing set of free tools that they have produced for the general public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a cost associated with using generic tools that are n't  built for managing specific types of tasks . The same could be said for trying to manage content production with a generic project management tool like Basecamp . You and your team are forced to bastardize these tools and create workarounds that decrease your efficiency , so the cost of time becomes the issue that we all fight with everyday . <p> For content planners and producers , we 've built Divvy to make your workflow more efficient , which gives you more time to do the thing you do bestproduce great content . How much is your time worth ? For about the same cost as you spend on lunch , Divvy will save you time and make your team more effective every day . <p> A Lot More to Come This is probably the biggest key differenceOf course Google will continue to make their calendar the best tool for managing events , but were focused on making Divvy the best tool for managing your content marketing program .

@@101010583 @5210583/ <h> New User Q&amp;A : How Many Divvy Content Calendars Do I Need ? <h> New User Q&amp;A : How Many Divvy Content Calendars Do I Need ? <p> Since launching Divvy back in September of 2011 , we 've had the chance to talk content with hundreds of marketers , content practitioners and media specialists . The only constant that we 've recognized among these conversations is that every organization is unique , especially when it comes to the maturity of their overall content strategy , planning and production processes . <p> On the mature , well-seasoned side of the coin , an organizations " managing editor " or " chief content officer " is typically able to set up a Divvy account and quickly understand/adapt Divvys content calendar structure , workflow and content data management offerings to fit their existing structures and processes . If Divvy fits like a glove , theyll be nice and cozy for the foreseeable future . If the fit needs a little tailoring , then we jump on the phone and talk through it . <p> On the noobie side of the coin , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me loves this part just as much ( if not more ) as talking shop with the pros . Earlier this week , we received an email asking <p> " We are a church . How do you figure out how many calendars you need ? " <p> Most churches probably do n't  have a seasoned publishing veteran at the helm of their communications department . But they have a congregation to serve and lots of programs and activities to promote . How many content calendars DO they need ? <p> Since this is one of the most important decisions that new Divvy customers need to make , I thought I 'd dig into this thought process ( and our methodology ) a bit to help all new Divvy customers determine their ideal calendar setup . <h> Content Strategy Introspection <p> Your Org Chart How is the organization structured ? Are there multiple regions , departments or business units ? Do they each need a separate calendar or a set of calendars ? As much as were not a fan of silos , some organizations are stuck with them . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up a content calendar structure that mirrors your org chart . <p> Primary Content Vehicles / Channels This is probably the most popular ( and recommended ) scenario we see organizations using . If your company has well-established content properties and distribution channels , you can set up individual calendars for each property or channel ( ex : a website content calendar , a blog editorial calendar , an email marketing calendar , a social media calendar , etc . ) . <p> Your Goals &amp; Objectives Occasionally , organizations choose to set up their calendars based on specific business objectives that theyve identified through strategic planning efforts . Examples we 've seen include a New Customer Acquisition calendar , a Customer Retention calendar or a Community Engagement calendar . <p> Your Buyers/Audiences Weve talked a lot about the importance of buyer profiling as part of your organizations ongoing content marketing effort . Some organizations have fully embraced this concept and set up individual calendars for the different buyer/audience segments , profiles or personas for which theyve identified and created content plans . <p> Your Content Topics , Categories , Themes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Divvy customer last week and she was heading down the path of creating individual calendars for each of the major " content pillars " that theyve identified through their content strategy efforts . <p> Frequencies As you think through these different calendar-setup scenarios , keep content production and publishing frequencies in mind . For example , setting up an individual content calendar for an email newsletter that is only produced once per month is probably overkill . But if your organization has multiple business units who are each publishing multiple email marketing campaigns per week , then Divvys multi-calendar architecture and color-coded master calendar will serve you well . <p> Your Team The last piece to consider is your team of contributors that will help you get all this done . You need buy-in and adoption . Which scenario would be an obvious fit that theyll easily understand and adapt to quickly ? <h> Quick Note for Agencies <p> Much of the thought process discussed above is obviously tailored for individual companies . If your agency is looking at setting up Divvy for your customers , you just need to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understand their organizational structure , content strategy and editorial schedule . Use this info to guide the setup and implementation process . <p> At the end of the day , which content calendar setup fits your organizations structure and content strategy the best ? There 's really no right or wrong way . We 've tried our best to architect Divvy to fit all possible scenarios and we hope that this blog post helps you find your ideal approach . 50881 @qwx910881 <p> I 'm on a trial with Divvy at the moment and I 've set up calendars , integrations , teams , etc . I intend to use it for managing multiple content calendars for a single clientone per facebook page or twitter I 'd . However , when I schedule a social post , it does n't  appear on the corresponding calendar . Why ? <p> Hey SavannahThanks so much for your question and for trialling DivvyHQ ! <p> The DivvyHQ calendar currently supports the display of 6 different types of dates . The future publishing date of a social post is not one of those dates at this time . However @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may suffice in the interim . <p> If you do n't  mind , I 'm going to have a member of our support staff reach out to you immediately to walk you through the alternative solutions . Support conversations via blog comments is not the best channel ; ) 
@@101010585 @5210585/ <h> Is there a master calendar available for all users to view ? <h> Answer : <p> The short answer is yes . By default , the DivvyHQ Calendar interface provides an aggregate- view of all your calendars ( a master calendar view ) and their associated content items . This aggregate view is determined by the individual calendars to which- each user has been given access . In other words , if I ( as a user ) have been given a role ( access/permissions ) on 5 calendars , my default calendar view will display all five calendars in aggregate . By default , account admins will see all calendars that have been created . You also have the ability to utilize the calendar filter to drill into specific calendars and adjust your default calendar preferences. - <p> For more information about our Calendar Interface give this- deep-dive article- a read
