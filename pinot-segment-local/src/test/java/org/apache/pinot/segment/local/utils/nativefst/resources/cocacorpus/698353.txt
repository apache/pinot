@@29878738 @3578738/ <h> A Guide : Travelling from Cancun , Mexico to Belize for Many Budgets <p> This is one of my most frequently asked questions and my post on the trip from Belize City to Cancun on the overnight bus is one of my most read.Its just a fact . - Flying into Cancun is usually so much cheaper than flying to Belize City . - There are so many more direct flights , the airport probably has 100x the traffic . <p> If you have time , its a great way to save money on your trip to Belize . - I usually suggest it to someone that is coming to Belize for at least 8 days . - Depending on the times of your flights to and from Cancun , you will - probably have a travel day on either side of your trip . <p> One quick suggestion for saving money : - If you do n't  want to travel to and from Cancun , try booking a " multi-city flight " . - Mix it up . - Flying into Cancun and out of Belize City @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ save a few hundred dollars hat way . <p> Okay . - Let 's break it down by how expensive the option is. - And the more money always means the fastest . <p> MOST EXPENSIVE Supposedly available in the next few weeks , you can fly on the new Tropic Air flight from Cancun directly to Belize International Airport . - The price or schedule for this option has not been announced yet . - Stay tuned . <p> I am not sure what size plane will be making the journey . - But here is one of their planes that flies in Belize . <p> If you are continuing on to San Pedro , the flight is an additional $78 USD . <p> LESS EXPENSIVE : <p> Unless you fly into Cancun early in the morning , your trip down to Belize ( 6.5 to 9 hours in total ) is going to require an overnight stay in Mexico . - I find that the very easiest place to stay the night is Playa Del Carmen , just one hour south of Cancun ( not marked on the map @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . - You can also go to Tulum if you do n't  mind travelling a bit longer ( one more hour ) after your flights . - It is also a great stop and will allow you to see the amazing ruins early the next morning . <p> here 's a map for you . <p> The distance from Cancun to Corozal , Belize ( the closest town to Mexico ) is about 300 miles . <p> When you get off the plane , exit the airport and ask one of the 100s of helpers at the help desk for the ADO bus to Playa Del Carmen . - The bus costs $120 pesos or $10USD and takes you to Playa Del Carmen . - The trip is about 1 hour . <p> Since you are leaving the next morning , its easiest to buy your bus ticket for the next day at the station before you leave . - Check the ADO schedule on-line for all the times . - Your final destination ? - Chetumal. - Also , make sure to ask which bus station you will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Carmen . <p> The town is laid out like a numbered grid . - So its quite easy to find your way around . - 5th Avenue is the pedestrian walkway/heart of Playa . <p> Now you have the afternoon , evening and the morning in Playa. - You can generally find a decent hotel on-line for about $40-60USD. - You can also find cheap hostels or gorgeous expensive boutique hotels . - Up to you . - Enjoytons of eating , drinking , shopping , partying options . - Its quite a big town . <p> Next morning , get on your bus to Chetumal at the correct station ( though they are about 10 minutes walking distance to each other , you certainly do n't  want to be running with all of your luggage if you pick the wrong one . ) <p> The ride is on a comfy , air-conditioned bus and costs just about $200 pesos or $17 USD. - I am a big fan of the front seats though once you pass Tulum , there is VERY little to see other than bugs hitting the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stops in Tulum and Puerto Carillo ( my favorite ) . - A tiny totally non-touristy town where ladies at the bus station serve delicious , cheap tostadas. - Make sure to get plenty of the picked red onions . <p> Chetumal , Mexico is your final stop . - You have a few options from here : <p> More expensive : - You can have a taxi service from Belize pick you up at the bus station . - I like Henry Menzies and crew . - They are always super prompt , have new air-conditioned vans and are very helpful about getting you across the border hassle and worry free . - They also are very quick to answer emails. - Leave over an hour for this transfer . - It costs $30USD no matter how many people you have ( up to 6 or 8 ) . <p> Though the distance is n't far ( its about 15 minutes from the bus station to the border and then another 15-20 minutes on the Belize side to the air strip ) , you want to give yourself time if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should NOT have to pay the exit fee from Mexico if you have been in the country for only one or two days . - They will sometimes try to charge youlet you transfer driver talk to Mexican immigration if this happens . - He can usually fix it ( another perk of paying for this service.that exit fee is about $25USD ) . <p> You final destination is the Corozal air strip ( a few minutes out of town ) and the 20 minute flight on either Tropic Air or Maya Island to San Pedro . - The flight generally costs about $60USD each way . <p> If you have an extra time at the airstrip , check out this bar about 200 feet down the driveway . - Let 's just say there are plenty of interesting characters there to keep you busy . <p> Less expensive : - There is also a bus that can take you from Chetumal to Corozal town and ultimately to Belize City if that is your route . - They are Belizean buses and generally leave from the Market in downtown Chetumal. - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bus . - It is CHEAP and SLOW . - Since the bus is often full , it will insure that you are on a line at the border . <p> Its a retired US school bus like thisbut red . <p> Once in Corozal town , you will need to take a taxi to the air strip if you are continuing on via air . <p> And LASTLY ! - The water taxi from Chetumal to San Pedro and then Caye Caulker , Belize . - Take a taxi from the ADO station in Chetumal to the municipal dock . - ( About $50 pesos/$4US and 15 minutes . ) <p> There are two water taxi companies ( though right now they are only running one boatwhich is a shame since the competition usually gets you lower prices on the fare . ) <p> For the boat , you deal with Mexico immigration and customs on the Chetumal dock and Belize customs and immigration in San Pedro . - Depending on the amount of people on the boat , this can take quite a while . - Make sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prior to departure . <p> If you are earlier , have a Corona at the new little bar set up on the dock . <p> Hmmmmperhaps I have made this more complicated than it needs to be ! - But there are really so many ways to do it . <p> If you have any questions , as always , send me an email at sanpedroscoop.com. - Its really not hard ! - Promise . <p> And if you have the time ( the most crucial part ! ) and can save $250USD or more on the flights ? - I think it is totally worth it . <p> Oh myI shiver remembering that trip . But it does cut out the need for the overnight stay . And that is a huge plus <p> Omaha Dave <p> I always think about this when I hear you talk about any boat trip for a long duration of time , esp . when you suggest having a beer before you leave = what about needing a bathroom while on the boat ? ? ? <p> Hey , has anyone done this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hoping to do this next March/April <p> Maggie <p> Hi , <p> I happened upon your link .

A cut in the reef just minutes away from downtown San Pedro . <p> Keep in mind that Belize is relatively tiny about the size of the state of Massachusetts . - Its just about 170 miles from North to South . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and cons of each spot . - But without moving there and really diving into the waters ( rather than just testing them ) its a tough call . - Both spots are gorgeous . <p> So here are what I think the differences and similarities areand then I 'll show you a few real estate options in both . <p> Hopefully it will help you get an overview . <p> AMBERGRIS CAYE : - is the larger community and growing by leaps and bounds as the road has been paved on the north part of the island ( partially for now ) and larger resorts are in the works . - The population , both expat and local , is larger than that of Placencia. - The most recent census in 2012 says 13,381. - During the winter months ( the " high season " ) , - we could be close to 20,000 . <p> There are more restaurants , bars , hotels and events . - There is a movie theatre , lots of shops and a bustling ( some might used the word crowded ) downtown . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transport is golf carts though cars are coming more and more to the island . <p> The barrier reef is visible from the beach which is generally lined with boat docks , scuba shops and a few over the water bars . <p> For those who want to dive or snorkel every dayor many times a week , who love the idea of owning a boat and just getting in the clear blue waters , Ambergris Caye is a great choice . <p> PLACENCIA PENINSULA : - I love it also . - And while I have never lived there , let me do my best to tell you what I love about this area . - Placencia , is a small SUPER CHARMING village at the tip of the peninsula with an estimated population around 1000 people <p> but there are other communities . - Seine Bight ( about 800 people ) , Maya Beachyou have optionsand each area- has a different feel . - And a small village sense of community . <p> The reef is off shore about 40 minutes to one hour by boat road so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gorgeous snorkeling and beautiful little cayes . <p> The beach is beautiful though the sand is river sand rather than coral a bit darker in color and can really heat up in the bright sunshine . - But during heavy rains , the water- can become a bit murky with local river run off . - Here is a picture of the beach in the Maya Beach area taken this February . <p> Placencia Peninsula is part of the mainland so that many people who move here own a carto travel to the Maya sites , the waterfalls , the hiking trails in the mountains , the neighboring areas and all that the mainland has to offer . <p> I asked Shane McCann of- Belize Sothebys International Real Estate to help me out with some example listings in both areas . - Belize Sothebys has offices in both places Ambergris Caye and Placencia so that if you are unsure , they can help you with both ( and , in fact , the entire country . ) <p> These are some different properties and homes scattered across the price scale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ photos . <p> Ambergris Caye <p> I will start with land . <p> Located 10.5 miles north ( north of El Secreto Resort ) is this small parcel of land . - $65,000USD. - ( I 'm kinda digging this one all I 'd need was a tentohand a boat . ) <p> For more seclusion AND a lower price , 8.5 miles north of town , this beach front home . - $449,000. - Click on the linkthe inside and the location are beautiful . <p> And one more larger home , located in the coveted Tres Cocos neighborhood , JUST north of town . - Villa Adagio. - $1,578,000 . <p> Sigh . <p> Now let 's take a look at a few properties available on the Placencia Peninsula . - Much of the mid-Peninsula is undeveloped or just beginning to be developed so there are some differences that you will see . - Such as planned communities <p> I hope that gives you something to think ( or dream ) about . - There are more listings at all different prices in both places ( and , again , around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? - Though 8 years ago , I picked Ambergris Caye ( without seeing one other spot in Belize ) , - I can easily EASILY see why people are drawn to both spots . <p> Please feel free to ask questions or make comments I know that both Team San Pedro and Team Placencia have very strong opinions . <p> Please note : - I am using the word expat for those who relocate from other parts of the world to live in Belize . - There is much controversy whether I am an immigrant or an expat. - I do n't  mind either word but for this post , I am using the word expat. 137205 @qwx337205 <p> One big difference we looked into when we were deciding between the two spots was amount of rain . There is a significant difference in the rainfall totals for northern vs. southern Belize . Going from memory , seems like it was something like 65 ? of rain yearly for northern versus 160 ? for southern . And when we visited Placencia during dry season ( winter ) , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a couple of days while AC was dry . But both have a lot to offer , as you note . Overall , we actually prefered the quiet of Placencia in many ways . Even during " high " season , it seems so relaxed and quiet compared to the hustle bustle of AC especially as AC is getting busier every year . Great post ! <p> Jim <p> Like Emily about 8 years ago or so I looked at both . We decided on San Pedro because there was a little more activity at the time . Of course the Island has exploded in population and conveniences since then and I have n't been back to Placencia since that visit so I cant compare the two nowadays . Maybe today my choice would have been different if I was starting from nothing , then again maybe not . Over the years you meet people and develop friendships and I would n't want to give them up or the familiarity with the Island .

The car to explore hasgot its appeals . <p> That first one looks perfect ! You may have been joking , but I 'm ready to sell my boat today and move down there . Are you really allowed to live on a tent on the beach down there , even if you own the property ? I know some countries have laws against that . <p> I 'm thinking a beach camping BNB .

@@29878846 @3578846/ <h> My Tour Around the Sanctuary Belize Mega-Project in Southern Belize <p> I 've posted for the past two days about my weekend tour of the absolutely gigantic project , - Sanctuary Belize . - Located between Hopkins and Placencia along the coast , the size in total is about 14,000 acres or 20 plus square miles . - Absolutely gigantic . - They have a super impressive website with the master plan and with all of the informationI am not going to even TRY to describe it all . <p> And before I start , as with any development , particularly one of this unprecedented size in this area , there is lots of information and some controversy out there . - I am in absolutely no position to judge any of it on my website. - This visit , as a guest of Sanctuary , was my very first . - I asked them if I could see the area ( via email ) and they incredibly graciously invited me for two days . - To mix with their potential investors , to meet their sales people , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no ground rules or discussion beforehand . - Just an invite . - They SO did n't  need to do that . - They could have told me that it was for potential investors only and I would have been fine with that . - Its private land after all <p> I am FAR from a real estate expert ( in Belize or anywhere else ) . - So , I think it is best to present to you exactly what I saw . - Youve seen the gorgeous resort Kanantik ( owned by Sanctuary ) where I stayedalong with about 30 potential buyers . <p> I did not ask hard , pressing questions ( though others did ) , I was a guest . - I looked around , I listened and I took about one million pictures . - Here is what I saw on my FULL day trip to Sanctuary Belize . - But first , take a look at the Master Plan on the website. - And remember , that this area is as large as the island of Manhattan . <p> Our group had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sanctuary , the Belizean owner/investor Johnny Usher and some of the many features of the project . - The part that clearly grabbed the most participants was what Sanctuary calls the " 5 Ecosystems " on the land . - From river to tropical savannah to jungle to Caribbean marine to coral reef all on one property . - And how the developers plan to make sure that all of those all kept intact and healthy . <p> Frank Connelly , the Director of Sustainability , really had a great story to tell . - Microclimates , conservation , employment of locals from the six surrounding villages , some of the cleanest drinking water on the planet running off of the savannah and of course , the show stopperSanctuary Caye. - About 18 miles off shore and owned by the Sanctuary owners . <p> After breakfast on Saturday morning , we loaded on a boat to head north from Kanantik to Sanctuary . - It couldnt have been more than a 15 minute ride up the coast . <p> We headed into a small deep water bay and then into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marina that will really be the heart of Sanctuary . - 200 slips that can house boats up to 150 feet in length . <p> Mangroves have been planted all along the banks and they spoke often of the many many more to come . - And how critical mangroves are to maintaining the environment in this area . <p> A fleet of Polarises were waiting for us each equipped with a stocked cooler for the morning ahead . <p> We started by cruising up to the top of a large clay mound fill from the massive amount being dug out for the marina . <p> Area for markets , condos , a hotel , everything this town -with 1800 lots Sanctuary will be one of the bigger villages in this area will need in the future.We headed down the mound and along the canals that are being dugwater front lots , most that are already sold . - A few which are being built on . <p> We stopped at this home . - Wellalmost a home . - Its what they called a " kit home " shipped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entirely from what seems like wicker . <p> The view of what will be the waterway . - Now dug out but waiting for flooding . <p> We loaded back in and drove down the soon to be waterway . <p> We stopped briefly at the lumber mill . - During the clearing of the lots , especially as they get closer to jungle and mountains , large hardwoods are being felled . - They are making every effort to use the wood for construction . <p> You can see a bit of the Mayan Mountains in the background . - I ca n't liethe view over the Savannah to these mountains is incredible . <p> We drove for a bit and stopped at another potential home . - Now a show home and the residence of many of the Sanctuary sales staff . - They called this one " Pod Style " . <p> Each room the bedroom , the kitchen/living area , the guestroom in its own very modern unit . - Almost Bali style . - You can finish one pod at a timeand during the rainy season @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handy . <p> Builders were on hand at many of the housing sites to talk about specifics . - We visited different houses of different styles , sizes and with different views . - This savannah area is going to go almost completely untouched by the project . <p> A very peppy lady showed us around her home . - The first of a few that were occupied . <p> We then stopped at Tom Hershkowitzs home he and his wife live here and he is a partner and part of the Sanctuary sale team . - His house is also pictured in the Wall Street Journal and he has a blog about his move to Sanctuary . <p> This was part of the ride over to see the progress being made on some of the roads by the savannah area . <p> We toured the gorgeous house with a view of the marina and headed over to the new beach club for lunchand some relaxation time in the pool . - I 'll stop with the pictures there for todayI have so many more from the pool area and from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things about the people that I met on my two day visit the potential investors from both Canada and the United States . - I 'd guess that the group was split about 50/50 . <p> A few of the people were definite buyers by the end of our tour . - They love Sanctuary , the story and what it has to offer . - They see the potential . - They know it is going to take time but they are planning for retirement or for their family or for an investment . - They are good hardworking earnest people who are really taken with the entire story particularly the environmental part . - And to me ? - That environmental focus was great news . <p> The other thing - was universal amongst all the participants after this tour and stay , they are totally SOLD ON BELIZE . - Maybe Sanctuary is not what they are looking for but they love Belize . - They want to come back and explore . - A few were thinking seriously about Ambergris Caye . <p> All of them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about cruise ships and that industry in the country . <p> SOfrom an economic perspective , this is a project that I really WANT to work . - And I cant wait to visit it in a year or two to see the progress . - I 'm hoping I am remembered very fondly by the home owners and potential home owners . - I will dream of that private island until I can get back ! <p> Stay tuned for LOTS more pictures tomorrow of the rest of my tour.into much more @qwx337341 137356 @qwx337356 137239 @qwx337239

Offshore oil drilling has been happening safely for decades . Yes , accidents do happened and the BP spill was awful , but striking a correlation between it and the sargasso problem is na+ve . It is easy to point fingers and the energy industry has been the target for pretty much everything these days . How are all those millions of tourists getting over to Belize to pump up the economy ? Jet fuel . With the sargasso problem , we just do n't  yet know for sure so we should withhold broad allegations against any one industry until we have more facts . <p> Perhaps correlation is too strong a word . Rather the connection between fossil fuels and sargasso has been made several times on this blog over the past year . And usually a reference to the oil spill is in there too . So I 'm not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Belize and that 's why I follow this blog . I just get frustrated with this type of one sidedness . The point is we do n't  know what is causing this problem . <p> I 'm not making any correlation between the two other than saying that for a country that depends on the ocean for so many things we should make keeping it healthy a HUGE priority . Oil drilling does n't  seem to push towards that in my book . I have no real clue why the sargasso is so badbut I 'm guessing global warming and fossil fuels are n't  help . But I did n't  mention that in this post . <p> Deanne <p> You did mention it when you referred to drilling in an article about sargasso . <p> blancojoe <p> Correct , Deanne . The global warming business has been shown to be a hoax on so many fronts and by scientists who lied and were totally fraudulent . But did that cause even a hint of a glitch in that GW crowd ? Not a bitthat fraud stuff never seemed to happen . Unfortunately , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a science , but as a pagan religion . Like a thousand things on that side of the aisle , if you are not " lock step " with the ruling elite , you are the ignorant enemy . Sad . <p> This is just sad . There seems to be no place in this world where you can escape this . I went to a seminar by marine biologist in Key Largo a few years ago . He s traveled all over the world , including many more remote locations , and said he saw garbage everywhere he s been . <p> Australia was the only place where he said there were spots with no litter at all . And that 's only because its so big that you can hike for a few hours into the outback and get to locations where very few humans ever go . <p> Connie <p> Sargasso and Trash two separate issues that have converged into one hot mess . Sargasso , bad as it is , is a natural phenomenon . The totally sad part is seeing the plastics and styrofoam float in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ industry is responsible ( and I 'm not a big fan ) . Agree with Scoop , most labelling that survives on the plastics is in Spanish . Does MX and points north have this Trash issue or is this solely on our coastline ( Belize/Guat/Honduras ) ?

We stayed in the middle of town ( an AirBnB rental ) , so we walked most places . ( I picked a place downtown for that reason . ) We did rent a cart two different days so we could explore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was perfect for us . <p> That sounds idealand i think that 's what many do . Try it out for a few dayssee if you like it = <p> rjhawkins <p> Option No. 4 : Bicycle ! A great way to slow down and actually see something other than the glimpsed blur of coconut trees , beach sand and blue-green sea . Fresh air ! Sunshine ! Exercise ! Decent roads ! Bike racks ! Less traffic ! Given the choice , I take my bicycle out every time . Life is slower , more people smile at you and say hello , and it is easier to find a parking space . <p> Heidi Strub Nelson <p> Yeah , we would have preferred bikes , but we could n't find any to rent . Definitely would have been preferable ! <p> There is a rental shop right across from Tropic Air these daysthey have really cute bikes . <p> jack g . <p> Oh yeah ! ! , Bicycle every time there is more that meets the eye when on a bicycle , than riding around on a cart ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that delicious breakfast from Estels ! ! Go for the gold and bike you will be glad you did ! ! <p> We stayed this past June and we rented a cart for the week . We wanted to be able to go as we pleased . However , know that if you do go bar hopping ( like mentioned in the article above ) AC has a police force that does have mandatory traffic stops/checkpoints every now and again . We encountered one the very first day we drove north towards Captain Morgans Retreat . We had a couple drinks but were by no means drunk . I could see how this would have been a very uncomfortable situation had we been driving intoxicated . It would not have been a good start to our weeklong vacation . However , there is so much to see farther north of town and to experience the true tropical feel of AC we definitely recommend a trip north . You MUST have breakfast at Akbol yoga resort ! We did n't  care too much to go farther north past Captain Morgans since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Same goes for the South side past Victoria House . If they would only pave the road South it is definitely as beautiful as the North . One tip , though , since all the carts seem to look alike . Bring along some sort of Item that can be tied to your cart so that you can easily recognize it . Once you park along front street while enjoying fritters and Belikin at Fidos and come out you 'll know why ! Its an endless sea of carts ! <p> Linda Young <p> We stay up north , and depend on the Water taxis to get us to town and back . Also , we have a nice taxi driver that we call if we want to really explore . Orlando is his name . Their are too many carts , no parking , and too much congestion . I love making friends with locals and the schoolkids on the Water taxi . <p> yes ! i forgot about the kids on the water taxi ! So super cute . I think its what I loved most on my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ live here . I never went back to the all inclusive vacation after that = <p> I was going to post that I could n't believe you overlooked the option of renting bikes but I see some others have already done that for me ! We much preferred biking around the island to taking a golf cart , except for carrying cases of Belikin , that is ! = Bikes are great if you 're staying within 2 miles north or south of town . Any further , and I can definitely see the advantage of a cart ( or the water taxi ) . Is Joes Bike Shop still in business ? He was great for bike rentals , assuming the hotel/resort does n't  have them available or for rent . Bikes all the way ! P.S. If staying north of the bridge , biking to the secret beach is definitely an option too . We used to head that way all the time , back before it @qwx337341 137356 @qwx337356 137239 @qwx337239

This is exactly why I love AC . When you visit , for instance , the Bahamas or the Virgin Islands you are mostly staying in a tourist area such as a large all inclusive resort . Sometimes you never leave that resort . You can do that on AC ( minus the all inclusive part ) but you would be missing one of the best things about a vacation here the local people ! You would never dare to drive a car into the back neighborhoods of Cozumel or Cancun . While on AC you are vacationing right amongst the locals . You give them rides on your golf cart on their way to/from work , you eat next to them at local middle and back street restaurants , you swim with them at the beaches and you get to know them at your favorite restaurant or bar .

The real point of the lagoon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what is on that side and some signage to tell them . Just hoping they will drive down the road all the way back to the lagoon is not really going to happen unless they are very adventurous . The fact is , parts of the lagoon side look a bit sketchy , not that they are unsafe , but if you our your spouse starts feeling uncomfortable , then you 're not going to stay long there or go back , especially at night . Remember most of us tourist are far from home and bit out of our comfort zone as is , so it takes more than one trip and time to become comfortable with all that San Pedro has to offer . That 's my take as a tourist from Canada . 137223 @qwx337223 <p> Thanks guys for your commentsvery cool bar . This new HUGE construction project shouldmaybebring people back .

A weekend in Belize ! <p> Weve heard so much about Belize . It has actually been my wifes dream to go there and dive the Blue Hole .

However , we knew that Ambergris Caye has so much more content , and we are also looking for our next place to relocate to , perhaps to start our own business , so we decided to head to San Pedro . It also helped that we got a gift from our family to upgrade our accommodation to a fancier hotel than we were used to = <p> San Pedro was everything we hoped it would be ! After getting used to the rigidly aligned calles and avenidas of downtown Cozumel , it was a pleasant surprise to encounter the graceful mess of San Pedro . <p> The alleys leading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and of course the charming means of travel around the island funny looking golf carts in all sizes and shapes . <p> We managed to fit quite a lot into this short weekend . We 've explored the island back and forth , dove the Blue Hole , played with curious sharks and an evil-eyed Moray Eel <p> walked around the beautiful Half Moon Caye <p> ate at excellent restaurants <p> a beautiful meal at " Taste of Thailand " <p> rented a golf cart , tried the local Pupusas <p> got an amazing massage , had a beer at the Palapas Bar <p> watched the sunset over the lagoon <p> read a book on the beach and spoke with many locals and expats about daily life on the island . <p> So after barely three days which felt like two weeks , we could definitely say that we will be back , and this time , we probably wont leave so soon = 137205 @qwx337205 <p> So glad you had a great time .

My husband and Inwill be back in our condo in SP at the end of Dec. this trip , we want to spend a couple of days on the mainland , seeing something different . I was thinking San Ignacio or Hopkins . But would 2 nights at the zoo keep us busy ? Our plain does n't  get into Belize City until about 5 pm . How long does it take to get to the zoo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it make more sense to go on the way back , when we could get any early start ? And is there anything else to do around the zoo ? <p> Small World Band <p> Its about 30 miles to the zoo from Belize City . I would suggest getting a private taxi from the airport to the zoo . I 'd estimate this cost at around $50usd . You could stay the first night at the TEC across from the zoo , check out the zoo in the morning too if you so desire , and then head to San Ignacio around noon . For transport from the Belize Zoo to San Ignacio you should be able to catch a local " chicken bus " that will stop somewhere around the Zoo on the highway . The people there will be able to advise you on this , if not a private taxi is also an option . I 'd guess a private taxi from the zoo to San Ignacio to cost around $100usd . Then back from San Ignacio to Belize City you 'll have no problem catching the express bus @qwx337341 137356 @qwx337356 137239 @qwx337239

Bigger PictureBigger PeopleBigger Continent . <p> I do n't  understand your fascination with the Hollywood actor/ singer type people . They are all overpaid glorified jesters , usually with socialist leanings . Most of them are uneducated and only " know " what they know from other leftists . No independent thinking allowed . They want to help the poor , but have no understanding or memory of what its like to be poor . They certainly wont associate with the poor , with a small number of exceptions ( Sean Penn , Brangela ) So , someone has convinced DiCaprio that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the way , we can make millions for him as a consequence .

It showcased researchers who were going against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Theo Colborn , who founded The Endocrine Disruption Exchange ( TEDX ) . She did this on a shoestring , as a modern pioneer in the genre of Rachel Carson . Being in this movie gave her attention she needed at the time , with the exact population she needed to reach . It helped that an elder Episcopalian bishop also appeared in the movie . I think Paul Stamets , the mushroom guru , was in the movie as well . It is likely this movie lost money , although so did Star Trek in the early years I have heard . I am hopeful that this project will add to the heft in Belize of those who want to keep pollution away and support increasing appreciation for the flora and fauna of Belize . Other countries in the more enlightened south are keeping international chemical companies out . Belize has not publicly done this yet . It needs to happen . Maybe Leo will help with this . I guess we will see . <p> Bryan P <p> If you look at a Google Earth photo of Blackadore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , washing away , so to speak . Just below the southern tip you will see acres of sand that comes from Blackadores beaches . It looks serious to me . Thank goodness DiCaprio recognizes this . I Googled the Architect , Jason Mclennan , and he is amazing . His office is in the Worlds Greenest Commercial Building , the 52,000 sq . ft . " Bullitt Center " in downtown Seattle Washinton . They recycle their own waste water and made 60% more electricity than they used last year . <p> No doubt that overfishing has hurt and they are going to build artificial reefs . That 's good . Honestly , it looks like they have the absolutely best people in the world involved in this project , so I think we should all support them in any way we can . They have committed to hiring local contractors and to training locals who can share their newly learned knowledge all over Belize . <p> Of course there are questions and " what ifs " but this sounds great @qwx337341 137356 @qwx337356 137239 @qwx337239

- Maybe . <p> We arrived at about 9:30 its about a 25 minute ride from town . - The day started cloudy but was turning absolutely gorgeous . <p> The caretakers residence . <p> The old dock on the leeward side of the island . - Stunning . <p> Juan and I took a short walk to look at the THICK needled grasses that covered thousands and thousands of crabs the main residents of the island . - Because of the grass , they really have no natural predators . - Land of the crabs crabs that basically eat any seed or seedling or anything they can . <p> Mangrove clay along the shores that are- mostly sick , - small and/or dying trees . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off shore as 300 to 400 feet this clay has been found . <p> Step back a bit and its all grass80% of the island . - Grass hiding crabs and grass that , when a storm passes through , basically just falls into the water . <p> It was time to head up north with the crew to check the wells that had been drilled . - The team is hopeful that there could be a large supply of fresh water under the island and will be working to discover it through some technology that I certainly do n't  understand ( yet ) . <p> Despite the fact that it was about 100 degrees away from the breeze , the views were absolutely amazing . - The shore line is higher than the center of the island and while it is beyond stunninglets pause for a second to gawkI spent about 2 hours doing it . <p> The sea grass has bleached completely white , like coconut , in the salt and sun . <p> And the behind us <p> And the testing areas . - We hit 6 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that was wearing long pantsthis grass is MEAN ! <p> The boat returned to pick us up on the shore line , took us back to camp where we were very well fed by the caretakers family <p> The look north <p> and south . <p> There is a ton of work to do here to make the island more sustainable . - There will be no seawalls they only cause erosion from underneath and erosion of areas near them . - The Blackadore team will be strategically planting mangroves , - filling and raising the entire island with organic manner , - rejuvenating the totally " dead areas " where salinity levels are so high that only algae can bloom and more . <p> This project will employ hundreds of Belizeans and when it comes to the high-tech specialized jobs , they will surely need foreigners , but the team plans to open a training center as well . <p> A new EIA public meeting will be re-scheduled. - And they have already scratched the idea of the over the water building at the protest of the local fly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ willing to work with the public , share their latest scientific knowledge when it comes to conserving our beaches ( WHICH WE NEED ) and want to do this problem right . <p> I say that for a privately owned island ?

5-did they tell you , that they know better than mother nature ? <p> 1 . Fill from , ideally , the agricultural , forestry industries of Belize and , possibly , sargasso ( if that becomes an issue again ) . Composting 2 . The limestone seawalls are temporary and are now JUST at the north end of the island after it was slammed by a storm last October . The water came up a foot to the caretakers house ( a few hundred feet from the tip of the island ) so they are trying to protect that end . 3 . What has been drilled is n't very deep they will be working with a specialized team from Spanish Lookout to do both radar ( ? I think ) and actual drilling for fresh water . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The exact hiring was not discussed since I was not talking to the hiring team . 5 . No , they do not know more than mother nature but they hope that by employing the most up-to-date technology that they can do the best they can to nurture the caye . <p> WHEW ! Those are my answers , not theirsbut I did my best . <p> Tom Vidrine <p> I have been in Belize for 25 years.and to Blackadore several times . The short-sightedness of my countrymen amazes me sometimes . No problem building Reef Villagedredging , filling and cutting mangroves . Now we have an island in the middle of nowhere .. that maybe 10 fishermen use to fish occasionally , we seem to have a problem with its restoration . I was there last week . The job they are doing is incredible . And giving Leonardo hell.why ? Who else would spend money to re-build , create something of beauty and structure that would only provide a haven for wildlife in the middle of an almost barren bay ? <p> DefendBlackadoreCaye <p> 1 . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ associated with it . This project is under scrutiny that all projects on Belizean land should be subject to . This project is under scrutiny because initial plans for overwater structures were clear violations of Belizean laws and of the surrounding marine reserve . This project is under scrutiny because in the Easter Sunday edition of the New York Times , on the front page of the real estate section , that " big name , " and the developers blamed local fishermen for what is actually a naturally occurring process . 2 . I am glad they are being somewhat open . This should n't be something we applaud them for . This should be something that is expected of all developers , regardless of what big names or fancy words they use . 3 . Until we see the new EIA , we cant know for sure what sort of improvements have been made or whether ALL overwater structures have been removed from the plan . 4 . No surprise that there was no mention of whether they plan to respect the marine reserve , the 66-foot Queens Land @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dangerous precedent in Belize if we allowed developers to violate our laws and restrict the access of Belizeans " for our own good . " <p> I agree that all should be open , but they are n't  and around here , they do n't  seem to be required to be . So I am pleased with that . You are rightwe must wait for the EIA . The NY Times article sucked and I told them thatI wrote a post just after it was published . I am cautiously optimistic with thisif they can find research that does save coastline and they can share it with our caye and others , that is a HUGE homerun . <p> DefendBlackadoreCaye <p> By the way , take a look at the Blackadore page on the Restorative Islands LLC website ( Restorative Islands flagship project is Blackadore ) . " Hundreds of jobs for Belizeans will be created , " except on that developers page , the exact number is 150 . Are 150 jobs worth the livelihoods of local fishermen , and the sanctity of our laws and marine reserves ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And though it was just one day that I was there , I did n't  see anyone fishing within sights distance . CLEARLY NOT THE RIGHT SAMPLE ( one day ) but just an observation . Also , I think that other cayes have violated the laws when it comes to Queens Land already . This would not be THE precedent . All that being saidI am again , cautiously optimistic and I think this sort of science based construction is a huge step forward . <p> Rob Franz <p> Would it be too much for Leo " The Magnificent " to raise funds and just help restore the Caye , and not make a buck off it ? As the self proclaimed Environmental Ambassador to the world , would n't that be the RIGHT thing to do ? <p> Its definitely a lot to askdont you think ? And I have no clue what the ownership structure isis he the sole owner ? I think we save " The Magnificent " for his acting abilityand THAT is what I 'm talking about when I say that he is put under tougher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big properties down southON AMBERGRIS CAYE . <p> Susan <p> Great report ! Thank you . <p> Jim <p> Excellent report Rebecca . Hopefully all turns out good on this project . So much bad has happened to AC and surrounding cayes on other projects especially on the lagoon side . If it does and sets a new higher standard for future projects that would be great but I do n't  blame the skeptics because of the history of what has happened in the past . <p> For sure . If Belize does nothing else , it makes you a skeptic of development ! <p> SPmQQse <p> HAHAHAHAHAHHAAA 137250 @qwx337250 <p> Why is the present mangrove sick ? I hope they will be very careful about fill . Mangrove can be poisoned by herbicides . There are people who have deliberately done this in Hawaii . Also , there are successful planting projects in some parts of the world . Also , mangrove has planted itself in parts of Texas , allegedly in response to global climate change , and huge snappers have been appearing in response . Its possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be very careful about bringing in clean biomass . With humans present , there will be compost . Bananas like compost . We need more red bananas in the world , my favorites . They are gorgeous and delicious . <p> The one mangrove is n't sickbut its just one white mangrove . One that is on the very edge of the shore . All the previous mangroves are goneand the island now is n't environment where they can return naturally . Unless something major happens <p> Jim <p> There have been a few small projects to plant mangroves on AC . They have met some success but I think the Sargasso weed of the last several years took its toll on the young plants . At any rate it seems to take a long time to get them to establish themselves and they are very important , I believe to hold the soil in place a make home for the critters . <p> SPmQQse <p> HAHAHAHAHHAAA <p> Laura Balis <p> really beautiful pictures Rebecca 137250 @qwx337250 <p> Thanks for replying to my query .

Those few minutes felt like an hour as we stood waiting to see what was walking through the jungle towards us .

Though English is the national language , most people do n't  speak it at home or with friends- Belize- is a small country and the only one in Central America that is an ex-British colony . - We are bordered by Spanish-speaking Guatemala to the west and south and Mexico to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the predominant language in all schools , at home , almost all Belizeans speak Kriol or Spanish . - Some speak Garifuna or one of the Mayan languages . <p> Shane on Raggamuffin Tours a native Kriol speaker <p> Kriol is a language unto itself and while its often described as a heavily accented , slang English , it has so many- different words and phrases , it can take years for an outsider to pick up on all of its nuances . <p> 2 . Time has a different meaning- " Island time " is real . - And its not carelessness- or lack of respect , its both a " go slow " mentality and an actual system that sometimes everyone seems to know but me. - Get to the bank and there is one teller ( for some reason the other 8 desks are closed ) and 25 people in front of you ? - Get in lineoften you 'll get chatting with- the other people in it . - Invited to a birthday party that starts at 4pm ? - Ask a Belizean for the real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been the one arriving as the balloons are being delivered more than once . <p> 3 . Groceries are expensive- If you want to eat any imported items , its going to cost you . - I think all of us do it when we first arrive . - You try to shop and eat like you did back home$15bzd boxes of cereal , $3bzd apples , $18bzd Doritos. - All those things are delicious . - But , man , there goes your budget . - Learn to eat like a Belizean. - Rice , beans , chicken , flour , sugar , IN SEASON vegetables and fruit , are very reasonably priced . - Or there is some DELICIOUS low priced food out there . - Your pocketbook will thank you . <p> Plus , the food is DELICIOUS . <p> 4 . No one will look at you askance if you are drinking a beer with breakfast This " rule " - is great for some and horrible for others . - If you are the type that just likes a beer with his fry jacks , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business and that 's a nice thing . - BUT if you are the type who came down here because you were drinking too much or sliding down a slippery slope of addiction , the permissive attitude of Belize , especially the more touristy areas , can be dangerous . - Are you moving to Belize because you love it ? - Or are you moving to Belize to escape yourself ? - Choice 2 never seems to work out that well . <p> A Michelada or breakfast beer or hangover cure . Beer with spices and worcestershire . <p> 5 . You Ca n't Always Get What you Want- aka Control Freaks Beware ! - Belize is a different country , a very different culture . - If you want things to operate like they do in the States or if you often find yourself starting a sentence with " Well , in Canada , the city council- does this or that " - You are going to find yourself in a downward spiral of disappointment and frustration . <p> 6. - The check- is n't going to be delivered to your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we usually " dine and dash " . - If your plate is n't cleared as you finish your last mouthful , you may get antsy. - In Belize , there is a much more laid back mentality ( catching a theme here ? ) . - Sure sometimes it may be slow- service , but often , wait staff feels rude giving you the check as if to say GET OUT . - Most of the time , you are going to have to ask for it . <p> 7 . The Internet is getting betterslowly - Belize has long been known for having some of the slowest &amp; most expensive Internet in the Western Hemisphere . - ( They do n't  mention that in the tourist brochuresnow do they ? ) - But it is getting better . - SO much better . - My 4G Mi-Fi is a little gift . - When you move down here , make sure to check out ALL of your options . <p> 8. - It Can Be Really Tough to Make Friends There are lots of different factors at work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a. - Its harder to make friends as you get older - b. - Many of us live in tourist towns that are quite transient - c. - Living in Belize is n't for everyone many people try it for a year or two and its not the right fit . - Volunteering , activities like SUP or Crossfitall good places to meet people . <p> 9. - If you are " city folk " , you learn that cats and dogs have balls ! - Well the male ones do- I 'd honestly never seen them . - Enough said . <p> Puppy Astro on North Ambergris Caye . I do n't  think he has thembut I just like this picture . <p> 10. - The leading question when you meet someone is not " What do you do ? " - When I lived in New York , what you did was who you are . - If that 's the first thing I ask someone here , I almost feel like I 'm attacking themit seems like a very judgemental question . - And one for much later in the conversation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean that you are going to make money ( no matter what the ad says . ) Turn Key ! - Positive cash flow ! - touts BusinessforSale.com. - Where you live , would you just take that at face value ? - Would you buy anything ( for more than about 50 bucks ) sight unseen ? - Would you consult no one but the seller ? - Would you not stake yourself out at the business for a week or two and undercover check it out ? - The same rules exist here ! - Small business is small business . - YOU are not going to revolutionize the bar scene- in San Pedro . - Trust me on this one . <p> And you are going to lose money if you think you are going to just unlock the door and then go lay on the beach . - Small business means hard work anywhere . <p> 12. - Electricity and water are not guarantees- Though what might be guaranteed is that power is going to blow on Christmas Eve , for at least a few hours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Mexicans turn off our power supply on Ambergris Caye , sometimes , the water company is waiting for a part . - It just happens . <p> 13. - Belize has seasons- Belizeahhhh Belize . - You are picturing temperate days- and sunny skies . - And yes , that is true most of the time . - But we do have seasons . - We get some cold spells in the winter with night time temperatures dipping into the high 60s. - Windy springs and HOT summers with rainy nights . <p> 14. - You are probably going to be awed by the view out your window or down your- street every single day and something unspeakable beautiful will hit you about once a weekif not more - This little country is packed with the most amazing beauty from a drive thru the misty Maya Mountains to dolphins swimming by the reef to just the view in Central Park , I 'm still shocked every day . <p> The view from the hilltop at Sleeping Giant Resort.Gorgeous Ranguana Caye off of Placencia . <p> 15. - Its pretty critical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ humor- if you are an immigrant to this country , you havewella bit less pull . - Sure , like everywhere , money talks but you are a visitor here in a different country , a different culture . - You need to go with the flow . - If just that statement " go with the flow " makes you cringe ? - Belize may not be your perfect fit . <p> I could go on . - And I bet those who live here could too ! - Please feel free to comment below and add to the listor let me know what you think of mine . <p> And if you are a Pinner ( one who Pinterests ) Pin away by pressing the button below . = 137205 @qwx337205 <p> I have been following your posts for a few months , and I thank you for this and all the information ! We will be taking our exploratory trip to SP in June . I hope to convince my husband to move there , sooner than later ! Now , about those restaurants in the States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( NC is my current home ) , we do have to ask for the check , and we never feel hurried . = <p> As a single person , it is almost ALWAYS cheaper to eat out . I eat out for luncha HUGE plate of rice and beans and chicken , often at Brianas $9bzdand then kinda nibble for dinner . <p> Michelle Kosin Jesus <p> I always find it interesting when I read other peoples blogs or reviews on trip to San Pedro and they say the food is expensive . Yes it is if you only eat like you did in the US . I understand the craving for something from back " home " but when I am there I always eat like a local because it is so delicious and inexpensive . Nothing beats fry jacks and a Belikin for late b-fast early lunch on a lazy day ! <p> For surebut I think I went thru the culture shock part a bitafter about a year , I would n't even look at rice and beans again . Was off them " for about 2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost every day . <p> emmalewis <p> Many of these things apply to Jamaica ( where I live ) too . But we are trying to change some things abolishing " Jamaican time " for example , and Internet has improved dramatically . <p> Haha ! Maybe that was the wrong word ! ! We are working on making it a thing of the past should I say = <p> FJL <p> I would like to add one more . Bugs , many that bite . For those of us with O+ blood and Mediterranean heritage ( i.e. bug magnets ) , bring some repellent . My great February trip there was only marred by 4 different types of bites , likely including bed bugs ( you get what you pay for ) . <p> Two words : Botlass flies . Not on the Cayes , but on the mainland . My fault for not wearing bug repellent all the time . And yes , fire ants , but being from the southeastern US , those I 'd dealt with before . Never the Botlass ! <p> Miranda <p> Great post @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I just emailed you one . Enjoy . <p> About the bugs : I have n't had too bad of a problem with them . I do n't  use bug spray any more because the scent of it makes me sick to my stomach . This trip , I 'm trying the old tried and true , Avon Skin So Soft oil bath spray . <p> True dat ! I moved to Caye Caulker about 9 months ago living , learning , and loving it ( for the most part ) ! The irony of #1 is when I find myself in one of the grocery stores , owned by the Chinese , trying to read the label on a can of food , which is written in Spanish , while I 'm in an English speaking country ! With #12 , you might add gas to the list . For those cooking with gas , you are most likely to run out at a crucial moment ( house full of guests ) , on a weekend , when you cant get a refill ! But when you look at the view , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thatnow that I have an electric stove ( blech ) , I forgot about propane ! Very good one . <p> Kat <p> We have two small gas cans , so when one always runs out at a critical time , you can just hook the next one in . And then fill the empty one right away ( yeah , right ) . We do the same with 5 gallon water also . <p> Dan <p> Wow , fantastic entry , one of your best that I 've read and I read all of them . Love your blog . Keep up the good work . <p> Love this ! So informative and fun ! What are your top 5 restaurants on the island ? <p> Sandie in Belize <p> Great info , excellent list ! I tell people who are considering moving to SP that you need to possess 2 things to be happy here &amp; call this " home " 1 . Infinite patience &amp; 2 . A great sense of humor . Without those , you might as well not unpack . <p> Robert Harper <p> I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like this on our Caye Caulker blog , talking about what we have learned our first year . Would you tell me about your Mi-Fi ? Who do you use ? <p> Bobby Nuvolini <p> Hello from Portland Oregon ! I am selling my home soon and am looking to relocate to Belize permanently . Very much interested in AC , but my tried and true profession is in the hospitality industry ( 20 years , mostly tending bar ) . Thanks for the heads up on the difficulties of securing such positions . Hoping an extensive resume with stints in Alaska and Hawaii may merit at least some considerations . At any rate , I 'm going for itsee you soon ! <p> last time we visited we rented a house in placencia so we could cook some ourselves and because my son and his wife came with us . We saw " dis be fi wi chicken " on a package of chicken . after some internet research and asking a couple locals we found out that the chicken comes from a kriol farm and it is " for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

But , you did give me a few things I either had n't  thought of or had not yet seen . I puchased some land and will be building my retirement home in the near future . Thankfully , none of what you have presented here do I consider a deal breaker . <p> Just found your blog ! Such great information ! My husband and I are going to San Pedro the first week in September of this year and staying for a week . We are also looking for property to maybe move there or spend winters there for now . Scary for us . We live in rural southern Wisconsin . We are going to have lots of time to explore . Maybe we can visit and meet you while we are there .

On your way ? <p> Lisa Parham <p> Thank you . Yes my plans are for October or November . Do you have any suggestions for a 2bedroom in caye caulker or any where else close to water for reasonable rent ? <p> We cant even count on power that much ! But if you have enough back up systems probably = <p> Tricia Wipfler <p> I want to warn all people who are living or thinking of living in Stan Creek . Shopping at A&amp;DS I is PAINFUL ! I have been here 20 years as an hotel owner . I have spent thousands with Andy Kulyen . They have a no return policy on nothing . Think twice before buying anything that has a no return policy . The sign is huge , rdead it ! Beware that once out of the store no reason matters , no return . I butchered my 660 pound pig , needed a huge freezer . I bought the most expensive , a Frigadair , up right freezer , $1,800 cash . I was told it had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days . On a Friday it started to scream late in the afternoon . I call Andy . He gives me the number of a repairman who does n't  answer . The nightmare begins as my $3,000 worth of frozen food is rapidly defrosting . I was told Andy was gone . I am panicked no repair man , no Andy . I call Saturday morning , no Andy . Told I must call on Monday . I use my friends phone Andy is there , oh my . I speak with him , ask can I get another replacement since my freezer is full of my expensive pig . He lied to me saying he did not have one or the same one or any freezer in his huge store . He promised to send a repair man . Finally Sunday a repairman shows , he does n't  fix the freezer , meats defrosting , still . Monday I am told I must bring the freezer to him . Impossible no one to move it . I ask him to pick up since he said it must go back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ send a repairman ! I am not feeling good about his customer service skills , I asked what do I do with all my meat ? He said give it away . Not at all happy ! ! Andy has committed to picking my freezer up on Monday . I have now rented a freezer . It was finally repaired on Tuesday . He informed me because I had a bad attitude he was not going to help me with my freezer I bought from him it is now Tuesday . A real f you is what he was saying . I am desperate at this point . Truley have a real genuine bad attitude . It is again broken , not freezing not even 90 days , still less than 6 months since purchased . He told me Monday a repairman would come to service my freezer . He never showed , still today a no show or a call back . I have spoke with him twice now with a promise to be called back on the time frame of a service man . I call again not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attitude if no call back and most of all no repairman ! Please understand my frustration . Do not buy at A&amp;DS . I am not a selected few . Ask anyone who shopped or has to shop there how painful it is to be subjected to such indifferent customer service . @qwx337341 137356 @qwx337356 137239 @qwx337239

The G16 will be more forgiviing in low light ( not your favorite shooting mode ) and is better than the G10 137246 @qwx337246 <p> I do know your vote ! But now I 'm swaying towards the Canon SX700 . I 'm not good at decisions ! <p> rw8mdc <p> Having just come home from there I wish I would have seen this place while vacationing in San Pedro because I never saw anything that looked like this .. the town is nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your disposal , getting to the north end of the island where it looks like this is a long long walkthrough a town that during the day has character but at night , a bit seedy . Do n't  be fooled as it does not all look like this . I was greatly disappointed and have been to many places way more beautiful than this . 137246 @qwx337246 <p> Victoria House is just about 1.5 miles south of townand looks exactly like this ! I walk from here to town onceor twice a day . Definitely no trick photography . I 've got lots of pictures of town proper ( though not much at nightIm not really a night person ) throughout my blog . <p> To get to the north end of the islandor over the bridge , you can take the water taxi ( Coastal Express ) so I do n't  think a golf cart is necessary . I havent had one and I 'm doing just fine . <p> I might have to agree with youthere are places prettier but I do n't  think places that have people as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just me ! Sorry you did n't  enjoy your time here <p> curtis <p> I believe the feet along with the blue polish in the foreground far outshine the background scene . just me , what a lovely view . 137246 @qwx337246 <p> Totally just you ! Or perhaps you have a thing for @qwx337341 137356 @qwx337356 137239 @qwx337239
