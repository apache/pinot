( Nyx fan here ) hope ur situation gets better ..@@ <p> FreuFreu <p> 11-09-2015 , 06:32 AM <p> Well you need to get the Nebu/ Penguin set . Ironically , the best way to get this is ANY fish king but not the king itself persee . You need to look for a swarm of players ( or better get a friend/guildie and ask when is his fish ) and kill the penguins which will give you the dagger to exchange for with the fishing association in Navea , near the sky tower . <p> Once you do , find the Vulture Vale fish king and get his set . From there you 're pretty much set up for your dubloons on any fish king before level 70 maps ( Mushroom forest and Emerald Marsh ) <p> For advanced fishing , get the Turtle set from Silent Ice Hill ( Poseidon set ) and lastly Stingray , ( You will want the Raven Spear from Swordfish fish king or be prepared for one hell of a fight ) . While these last 2 are optional , they do make your fishing rates faster and a walk in a park , outside the 4 meta fish kings . Before attempting the Stingray however , raise your fishing rank at least to 6 . <p> The other alternative method is to buy from AH if there are any but you still need to gather the mats anyway so I only take this option if you had n't been lucky with your catches from RNG . <p> Btw , all the aforementioned ( except Raven ) are all-around types . you can tell mostly because their set bonus gives HP . Skill , Str and Spd sets give damage . <p> Cureless <p> 11-09-2015 , 08:54 AM <p> Thanks for the info , i 'm currently working on getting the Wise master fishing set , from VV .

Stay posted ! <p> To clarify on the pictures of my stats in this guide , they were taken with food/drink buff , my class buff , and my 3-star Yarnaros out . So please take this into consideration , as always , use your buffs to " finish " maxing out the stats ( ie 50% speed/75% def ) . <p> Alright , after working with different subclasses , I think it 's time to try ( again ) and write a comprehensive Ravager guide ! <p> This guide is for a PvE-based Ravager , focusing on Zeal procs/Speed/Crit <p> Nazru pistol have a built in lifesteal of 2% . However the ST pistol is arguably better than it since you can put nocturnal in it ( 3% lifesteal ) , this 1% diff is a lot . Also ST pistol grants double damage , which is essential to his build . Nazru pistol gives crit only , which he should have plenty of already .

And to pay the propper tribute to this gorgeous little girl , we have bring to our community a contest of the creative type . <p> Event Details : - Amaterasu is the Goddess of Creation , so there 's no better way to pay tribute to her than a creative-type of contest . And it has been long since our last art project ! More reason to remind you how they work . - You will have to submit one original piece of art , created by you , and inspired by the Eidolon Amaterasu .

Inspired by Amaterasu ( which does n't mean it must be an exact copy of the eidolon ) - You will have time to submit your entry until April 1st , on this thread . - No offtopic , no votes , or comments about other people 's entry . Only contest related doubts and entries on this thread . <p> Judgement Criteria : - We 're looking for original and esthetically beautiful designs , inspired by the eidolon . The creativity invested will be an important part of the judging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outcome , etc . <p> Prizes : - We will select 3 entries and reward the authors with Amaterasu Key of Gaia . <p> A very nice event . Though the deadline given to us is less than a week , I wonder if I can make it . <p> Also , I have some questions ; 1 . So this is n't only limited to a fanart of the new eidolon ( or are we even allowed to draw her at all ? ) and that we should be able to draw anything , and/or anyone as long as it is inspired by the eidolon ? Would appreciate it if you can explain more about this . 2 . What would this contest favor ? A landscape or a portrait work ? 3 . I do n't get this part : <p> 1 .

I do n't get this part : <p> Which existing image are you referring to ? <p> Anyway , good luck to all participants . <p> 1 . As said above , inspired is the key word here . Meaning it can be your own interpretation of the eidolon ; you can draw her of course or a variation of her . As for landscape or portrait work , it depends mostly on your good taste and your own use of resources . You can do both and I wo n't favor any of them , it depends entirely on the outcome . Despite of that , different type of entries can prefer one of another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no necessarily for a wallspaper . As for existing images , it means you do n't have to draw/create everything in the image , but you can use already existing images as resources . For example , you can use screenshots ( of game landscapes or of your character ) , even official images to combine with your artwork . You can even use the image I left in the bottom of the thread of Amaterasu . What you ca n't do is to steal other people 's art without references .

NUFF SAID ! Lel . Tachi is a DPS melee class that can balance out Single Target damage and AoE damage . Though , Tachi is a squishy class BUT , Its main defense is to kill the target before it kills you ... #Intense ! <p> Soulcutter Main Hand Level : 4 Off Hand Level : 43 Buff + Single Target + 15sec Cooldown Increase attack and evasion . Become able to use the ultimate technique " Flowing+Chaotic Tachi " . Decreases 10 points of Soulblade every second and the effect ends when Soulblade reaches 0 . If main hand weapon is tachi , additional effect of damage received -20% , lasts 1 minute . Release the sealed soul within your blade to increase your power and be able to use the unique ultimate technique once within the unleashed state . <p> Iaido Slash Main Hand Level : 13 Off Hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cast + 10sec Cooldown + 27meter Range + 6meter Area Increase damage by 10% . Hold the skills hotkey to charge power and release to unleash the skill . Different additional effects will occur depending on the level of the power gauge : power gauge 50% increases the skills damage by 30% ; power gauge 100% increases the skills damage by 80% and increases the skills critical damage by 30% . Increase Soulblade by 12 points to be used through " Soulcutter " to release immense power . Concentrate your willpower and channel all your strength into your blade . With a single slash and a single breath cut down all those who stand before you . <p> Brilliant Dragon Main Hand Level : 18 Off Hand Level : 49 Attack + 5meter AOE + 6sec Cooldown + 2meter Range Inflicts stun . Increase Soulblade by 10 points to be used through " Soulcutter " to release immense power . With a spiraling leap , take on the form of a fire dragon to slash at enemies and decimate all targets within range and inflict stun . <p> My target @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HP Pool while maxing DEF with 50% EVA . Also , is to have 30% - 50% SPD without investing any offensive stats for it . <p> My goal for this build is to be the worse DPS Tachi ever ( Not really but you will be sacrificing a lot of DPS for better reasons you will experience in game ) and in exchange , is to be able to be a really AMAZING support in dungeon runs . <p> Stats:DMG - Is your main Offensive Stats . Invest every points here . CRIT - This is not our concern but in the envoy path , I 'll be taking the Node that increases 3% CRIT per attack but it resets after CRIT . SPD - Is your secondary Offensive Stats . We do n't have to invest any points here because we 'll be using a lot of SPD gears , buffs , and food buffs . <p> So why is DMG our offensive stats ? Since we 're not gon na be using a DPS gear , going pure DMG would be the best way to give us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amount of SPD will make our DPS even more bigger ! But , our role is n't going to be a DPS here in this build , just a Semi-Support while dealing great damage . <p> HP - Is your main Defensive Stats . Invest every points here . DEF - This is an optional stats . If you are not thinking of fortifying your armours ( I suggest you should though ) , invest SOME points here . If not , then simple fortify your armours and you 'll have enough or even more DEF without investing any points . EVA - This is our secondary Defensive Stats . We do n't have to invest any points here because we 'll be using gears that gives EVA , Envoy path nodes , and Secret Stone Sigils . <p> Full HP is really recommended because we can easily cap our DEF just by refining our gears . EVA will be our secondary defense so it compliment our capped DEF in the future ! Just imagine how tanky 60,000 HP 75% DEF 50% EVA is at Lv60 . It 's beautiful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nocturnal and Shocking for my weapons because of our " Flowing Tachi Skill " . It 's really self explanatory but long story short , 10 attacks per second on a big group of mob ? OP PROC IS OP ! ! ! I chose Imperial as my Crafted Core because I want to maximize our Utility and it 's really useful in dungeons . You 'll see in game ! D : &lt; . I chose the Nazrudin Set as an end-game accessory because of the SPD and EVA . We 're trying to get as much SPD and EVA without investing any stats on our offensive stats and this accessory can help us do it . <p> My reasons are going to be the same as the Lv50 one . Shocking and Nocturnal core will remain the same , Nazrudin set will definitely be there forever , same trophy stats , same cores , and the same armour set except higher level . So you notice I wan na use Titan Set 2 . Everyone hates it cuz of the set bonus . Well , I hate it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stats and the fact the we can put a crafted core in it . <p> Stat Goals &amp; Target <p> At Lv50 following the Lv50 build +0 , I expect to have at least : 20,000 DMG 10% CRIT 30% SPD <p> 30,000 HP 40% DEF 40% EVA <p> At Lv60 following the Lv60 build +0 , I expect to have at least : 30,000 DMG 10% CRIT 35% SPD <p> 40,000 HP 50% DEF 50% EVA <p> At Lv60 following the Lv60 build +0 WITH food buffs and buffs , I expect to have at least : 30,000 DMG 10% CRIT 45% SPD <p> Scenario 1:From Lv1 - Lv55 you 'll be pretty much soloing to get rid of the main quests . From my experience , I did n't have any trouble doing so alone . If you read the skill informations , there 's a skill called " Dark Fang Thrust " . That 's your chasing skill when you 're going offensive or escape skill when you 're going defensive . It works the same as Windfury from Guardians BUT , if you press the skill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forth dealing damage to everything that connects AND applies a really strong DoT ( Damage over time ) that can stack 3 times . I wo n't go detailed on this one because by the time you finished your main quests , you 'll be getting used to the mechanics already ! <p> Scenario 2:Solo Dungeons ! My favorite part ! Now you might be thinking " Oh , I should just go inside this red por- " STOP ! Before you go in ... There 's this thing called the " Soulcutter Bar " or w.e it is but , it looks something like this : . BEFORE you go inside the dungeon , MAKE SURE that this bar is filled up . IF NOT , just spam your skills on the mobs outside the dungeon . <p> Done ? Great . Now go in and do the typical B2B ( Boss to Boss ) run where you just run straight to the boss aggroing a lot of mobs . Right when you 're about to reach the boss , It 's expected already ; P. RELEASE THE SOULCUTTER @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ THE GROUP OF MOOOOOBS ! ! ! @ ! @&amp; ( ! *&amp;#@$@#$ . FRICKIN AWESOME RIGHT ? ! What ? You 're tired of pressing the " Flowing Tachi " skill hotkey 100x per second ? *facepalm* . You do n't have to press the hotkey repeatedly , you can just hold the hotkey and it will slash 10x per sec for you lel . <p> They 're dead fo sho . Now the boss ! It 's solo ... Do n't worry about it . I like to start off with the sexy combo against the boss : Brilliant Dragon &gt; 3x Dark Fang Thrust &gt; Thousand Slash . It 's beautiful : 3 . After doing so , just spam your first 2 skills and when the CD(Cooldown) of the rotation you just did is done , do it again ! It 's fun trust me : 3 . <p> Scenario 3:Party Dungeons ! It 's pretty much the same as the Solo Dungeon one . Make sure your soulcutter bar is filled up before going in . B2B , just run straight to the boss with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did in Solo Dungeon . If the party leader decided to ask the bard/tank to lure , just sit down and wait for your food to come to you and OMG SPAM THAT FLOWING TACHI SHET TO THEM ! ! ! ! GAHH . It will never get old mate . <p> Off to the boss ? Just do those flashy 3-skill rotation on the boss and you 'll do fine lel . <p> Scenario 6:Arena PvP ? Wdf you doing there bro , we 're a PvE character ! STAHP OI . Nah jk . If you decided to go try the Arena with this PvE build , then YOLO ! Just make sure you have Fell weapons ( +15% ACC per weapon ) so you know , you can kill dem full eva fgts . Anyway , your gameplay should be REALLY defensive here ... But it depends on the situation . If you think you have a great team that can carry each other , just dive in and do our rotation listed above . If you see the enemy just diving in going full yolotard , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dw , we 're not that squishy thanks to this build x ) . Even though we 're using PvE gears ... We 'll be fine lol . JUST HAVE FUUUUUN ! <p> Uhm , I therefore conclude that this build is beautiful ... Lel jk . Uh , If you actually read everything from top to bottom , thank you for your time and I promise you , you wo n't regret following this build if you actually did . Overall , do n't stress yourself too much if you think you 're doing bad ? Or something ? Just think that this build is going to be great in end-games . BUT , Do n't forget to have fun ! And omg you 're gon na have fun with Tachi for real ... It 's a really flashy class . x ) . I 'm really bad at outro 's so ... Very guide , such Tachi , so slash , wow . <p> Guide looks great ! ...

This game would n't be the same without the amazing amount of fashion that allows you to customize your character like no other . And since most of us are fashion addicts , we have a slightly different proposal of our usual fashion contests . <p> So what you have to do ? First of all , in order to get this party started , you will actually need a party ! This is a group fashion contest . You will have to team up with -at least- another three players and design the perfect party look . So here 's the other catch ! You need to post one groupal screenshot , and all the members of the party will have to come up with related looks . You can use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as famous TV , games or anime characters . In fact , you can use any type of themed-topic , as long as it 's explained on the entry and the looks are cohersive between each other . <p> Only one of the players will post the screenshot , and only one screenshot is allowed by group . In the entry , you also need to add the " theme " of your entry and the name of all the players involved . The screenshots can not be edited . <p> You will have time until February 16th to post on this thread . The most cohersive and original entries will be selected as our winners .

After all , and if you think carefully of it , Aura Kingdom 's backstory is mainly a love one . Tragic and painful , it ends up in madness and with the evil attempt to conquer the world ... But are n't all love stories a little bit like that ? <p> The honest true is that , after one year of playing together , we still only know a few about Aura Kingdom 's main characters and Belenus nemesis , Reinhardt . We started the game with merely a nightmare and almost no memories of our past life . In all of this time , we have learned about our very own strength and how dangerous our power can be . But about how everything started ... We barely know anything ! So in order to commemorate our Anniversary , I 'm asking our players to actually commemorate the game @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's time to let your imagination fly ! I will ask you to tell us a story of the beginning , far before your first recollection of Azuria . It can be story about Belenus and Reinhardt ; how they dispute started and why it escalated so much . It can be a story about Reinhardt 's younger days in the Templar Knights , his missions , his friendships , how he met Lucfa ... It can be a story of how Lucfa died and what was the mysterious illness that took her from this world . It can be any story you imagine ! <p> You will have time until February 16th to submit or edit your entry , on this section . Here , you must only add the link to your thread .

Basically , you will have to create a trailer for our server , something that captures the spirit of our community . It can involve a story , online chatting , dancing , killing monsters or even -if you are one of those almost extinct species- pvp . It can be emotional or pure action , after all this is also your server and you can choose the best way to portray it . <p> You will also have until February 16th to post or edit your entry , on this thread/COLOR .

There 's no secret about the unlimited amount of cheats your admin has as resource to look like a strong character . You probably have witness the ability to insta-kill large amount of monsters or players , the high HP , DEF , Damage and Evasion ...

On February 14th ( sorry if you have a date , but if you do , why you play in the first place ? ) several monsters will appear in the world of Azuria . Of course , I will still be equipped with my GM gears , but you 'll soon discover how little they do against constant attacks . And since I 'm just like any other mortal , you will have the special task to protect me . Tanks , bards , melees , rangers ... You will all have to work together to kill the bosses and keep me alive .

@@23369996 @3369996/ 21183 @qwx221183 <h> Screenshot Contest Cosplay Party ! <p> A while ago , after receiving other complaints about promotions and pvp , Ema decided to cool off a bit and find something to explore . So she went to Victoria to ask what is this manga she is always talking about . And so Victoria introduces her to world of manga , and oh my , Ema is drowned into that world ! She viciously starts reading it so that she almost forgets about her duties ! But that 's not over ! Vicky took a risk and introduced Ema to the world of cosplay . And now she ca n't stop cosplaying characters or EVEN people from her kingdom . She also tries to cosplay Mia , which is a reason why you see Ema with white hair a lot . But the maddens of cosplay took a whole new level ! She wants to hold a cosplay contest and reveal the best cosplayers of Azuria ! <p> You will need to cosplay a certain character from anime/manga/game/novel and etc . You can even try to cosplay real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you think that we will accept just an ordinary screenshot with cosplay from you ? Nope ! You will need to think of a plot of your screenshot ! Whether it 's a cosplay party or an attempt to cosplay a scene from anime . It can be anything as long as it has a plot ! And do n't forget the description of your screenshot ! Also , you can do a screenshot together with your friends . But the maximum amount of people on the screenshot is 5 . And btw , you are prohibited from editing your entry ! But you still can crop it if you need.Who you ca n't cosplay ? <p> You are a bit limited in cosplaying characters from specific sources . So let 's state who you ca n't cosplay even if you wanted to : <p> 1 . You ca n't cosplay a character that does n't have an official source <p> This basically means you ca n't cosplay any OCs ( original caracters ) , whether they are yours or somebody else 's . Every character , that you cosplay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an anime , a manga or a game . <p> 2 . You ca n't cosplay certain characters due to existence of their costume pieces/sets in our game <p> There might be more characters , but Ema could just forget about them . Just remember , that if a character from a source has set or piece of set in AK , then you ca n't use him/her for cosplaying . <p> 3 . You ca n't cosplay characters in their unofficial outfits <p> Basically , you are prohibited from cosplaying characters in kimonos , school uniforms and swimsuits unless it 's their official outfit . But remember , that the most advantage will be given to players , that will try to cosplay characters in other clothes.Exclusion : Vocaloids , but they should have a song , from which their outfit was taken . <p> 4 . You ca n't cosplay a character , that was already cosplayed in this thread <p> Should I even explain it ? xD <p> What each entry should consist of ? <p> - Screenshot - Description - IGN(s) of participant(s) - Name of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their usual appearance You can see in the first reply of this thread our example of the entry . But you do n't need to strictly follow it , just include 4 main points mentioned above . <p> Deadline : 10/06/2017 , 10:00 pm -server time- <p> There will be 3 winning screenshots. 1 Grand Winner and 2 Honorable Mentions . They ( which means every player , whose IGN you stated ) will receive the same prizes : you can choose 1 of the packs that are mentioned below . As for the Grand Winner , all of them will also receive Demeter 's key of Gaia as an additional prize ! <p> Before this contest , Ema made the whole city cosplay any character , including the templars . Sadly , Andre and Alex were on honeymo ... I mean on duty at the time , with only Anya and Vicky left . At first , Vicky was against it , but then she accepted her fate , unlike Anya . She was fighting with Ema because she did n't want to wear Athena 's horrible clothes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decided to head back to Chapel . She wanted to report to Ema that everything seems to be fine , but then , she saw this scene . Anya lying on the ground with Ema swearing on her . Turns out that Ema finally made Anya cosplay Athena , but that stubborn templar declined to do any work , so she just laid down on the ground , pretending to be dead . Ema , who was shocked by this behavior , started trying to get that girl up and to go do her duties . If only this could end already ... <p> As King Omdoria 's health deteriorates , the contest for the power of the throne escalates . With a war soon to break out in the kingdom of Ivalice between the knights of the Northern Sky led by Duke Larg and knights of Southern Sky led by Duke Goltana , refuge became scarce for Princess Ovelia . Agrias suggests Ovelia be taken to Lionel Castle , where she believes Cardinal Delacroix of the supposedly neutral Church of Glabados could protect her . However , they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against them and have Ovelia executed . During the night they escaped and fled into the thick of the dark forests , facing monstrosities and difficult terrain with Delacroix 's men in pursuit . <p> They move south in hopes to rally with Ramza 's party but alas , somewhere along the way the princess stumbled allowing chance for their pursuers to close the gap . Agrias was more than willing to die in her place if it meant so much to buy her time to escape but Ovelia would have none of it . How could she not ? Unaware to her most devoted servant , Princess Ovelia had learned the truth about herself from her captors in Lionel ; that she is not who she believes herself to be ; the only value in her life was the very veiled deception shrouded around her built by her captors . Now she faces the dilemma of losing the only one true person who would never lie to her , who had shared her isolated life in the church , who would follow her to the ends of the earth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ princess spoken as if they belonged to God . And so , Ovelia used her deception , ordered her servant , her protector , her one true friend ... to leave her and find Ramza . <p> Never in the holy knight 's sworn dutiful life as her guardian did she ever opposed such orders until now but it is met with repeated equal denial and greater urgency . Caught in struggle of tension , time and confusion , Agrias was reluctant to leave , only if it meant to save the princess with Ramza 's help ... unaware that the only person she was actually and truly worth saving was herself . <p> ---Running errands and taking phone calls for Junk Shop Heibon takes a toll on Aobas stamina . After finishing up the last run , he was starting to gain an immense headache . Aoba went home first to drop his bag off , accidentally leaving Ren behind .

In general terms , most of the community here is already familiar with our names , with our style , with our ways to do things , for almost 3 years . To that privileged portion of our population , probably there 's little I have to say about which type of server Twin Saga will be . But in case introductions are actually needed , the most important thing you need to know is that this is n't our first rodeo . <p> Sucessfully managing a private server for almost 3 years and be able to keep a steady and stable community is not a minor achievement .

And if there 's something we can proudly say about Aura Kingdom , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its members . <p> But this also means we have found an important balance : A balance in our economy that allows all players to have access in important objects and yet still make enough to stay open . A balance in our market that allows players to control the game 's economy , the values and transactions . A balance in the game difficulty ; not too easy to be a grinding impossible task , not too hard to consume all of your free time . A balance in how we introduce content : we do n't wait long enough , but we do n't add everything so fast you go through everything new in 1 day . <p> We take every decision we make seriously . We listen to our players , and do our best to introduce their suggestions when they are reasonable . We limit them if they are hurting the server . Its a delicate and important relationship that allowed us to get here . And now , is with great joy that we welcome this new addition to our family !

It was very late in the evening , actually way too late for the little babygirl . She was walking full of energy hand in hand between Fina and Zaro , humming little tunes of her own . Walking right before them was Duet leading the way . Today was a special day , so the children were allowed just this once to stay up late .

@@23370030 @3370030/ 21183 @qwx221183 <h> How To : Fix Your Guild Emblem 's Pink Edges ( with Lots of Pictures ) <p> What are you even talking about ? <p> A quick look through the guild roster shows a trend : FUCHSIA , the color that Aura Kingdom treats as transparency for Guild Emblems , seems to be wrapped around many of the emblems like month-old flatbread . And since FUCHSIA is a particularly clashing color , one can assume that it 's there because the person who made the emblem just could n't get rid of it . In fact , the forces of FUCHSIA could be invading your Guild Emblem this very moment . <p> But that 's what this guide is for : exterminating unwanted FUCHSIA from the edges of your Guild Emblem . I 'll first explain why it happens and how to fix it , and then provide an example piece with a step-by-step process . <p> Why your emblem has edges : <p> So as I said above , there is a very particular shade of pink that Aura Kingdom , when it comes to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as transparent . This is specifically the color #FF00FF in hexadecimal . You might also recognize it as 255,0,255 in RGB . The actual name of this particular shade of pink is , of course , FUCHSIA . <p> THIS BLOCK ON THE LEFT BECOMES THIS BLOCK ON THE RIGHT <p> If you only see one colored square above : that 's good , and what 's supposed to happen to your Guild Emblem 's transparent parts once you load it into the game . Paste an emblem image over that square , load it in , and the square disappears , leaving only the emblem image , looking clean-cut and spiffy . <p> Except for one case , which is : resizing your image . Let 's be honest , most artists do n't operate on a 32x32 pixel canvas , so most Guild Emblems that are n't already pixel art themselves are first reduced in size . Programs like Adobe Photoshop , or its **26;0;TOOLONG counterpart , GIMP , use a resampling algorithm to help make pictures that are reduced in size still look recognizable to what they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means that when you reduce the size of your emblem image , the edges of the smaller image are not actually opaque . <p> Simply looking at the emblem image on top of a FUCHSIA background wo n't reveal the problem ; it 's not until you load the emblem image into Aura Kingdom that the semi-transparent edges of your smaller emblem image , now combined with the FUCHSIA background , create a slightly different shade of pink that the game does n't recognize as being FUCHSIA , and therefore does n't make transparent . <p> This also applies to art that uses semi-transparent border pixels to begin with . <p> The vertical lines are opaque , and BLACK ( #000000 ) . The horizontal lines are 30% opaque , and mix with the background to produce a shade of pink that is not recognized as FUCHSIA . <p> Once you realize the problem , however , you can fix it . The most obvious method would be to go through your emblem image 's semi-transparent edge pixels and paint over them , one by one , with an opaque @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first place , or a border color of your choice , like BLACK , for example . This method is time-consuming , but it 's the best way to preserve the color integrity of the original picture . <p> The simpler method takes much less time . By using a few handy layer mask tools , it 's easy to remove any pixels that are n't 100% solid colors . The drawback ? The total size of your emblem image becomes a bit smaller , and depending on how fine the details of your image are , you might have to put finer touches on the edges to make them look " good " . <p> How to do , CELESTI ? HOW TO DO ? ! <p> For this little tutorial , I 'll be using the emblem image for SUPERBOSS as the example . I also assume you 're using an image-editing program that uses layers and layer masks , so if you 're still using MS Paint , for some bizarre reason , go ahead and click that GIMP link above and get yourself situated with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Photoshop myself . First , I 'll demonstrate the fast method ( using a layer mask ) , and then a brief demonstration of the slow method ( fixing each pixel on its own ) . <p> This is Elizabeth at full-size , a graceful 256x256 pixel portrait . At this image size , she is happiest , but the size has to go down to 32x32 for her to make it into Aura Kingdom as a Guild Emblem . This is the easy part ; all you have to do is adjust the size of the image , from 256x256 , to 32x32 . <p> The options here are n't terribly important ; your default settings should be just fine . <p> The result , zoomed in . We can clearly see the semi-transparent edges that will ruin our Guild Emblem . <p> Elizabeth is not happy with those edges , which will show up as pink dots all around the picture once she 's loaded into Aura Kingdom . To fix this , we create a layer mask that helps us find and remove the semi-transparent pixels . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've created a mask that shows a pixel as either white , or black , depending on whether a pixel " exists " , or does n't , in the picture . What we 'll do next is tell the mask exactly what counts as " existing " by tweaking the threshold value . <p> Once you 've done that , just Left Click on the image in your Layer tray ( left of the Mask that you clicked earlier ) and you 'll have an emblem image free of any semi-transparent edges . All that remains is to add a layer of FUCHSIA behind your emblem image , and save it as a . BMP file . Make sure your emblem is using 24-bit depth when you save it ! <p> Final result , zoomed in . No transparent edges here . <p> Though it looks chunky close-up , at 32x32 , it 's not as bad as you might imagine , and for emblems that are more along the lines of a coat-of-arms , or a shape , rather than a person 's face , this is usually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for you , however , there is a secondary method that relies on your own judgment . It takes a good bit longer than the above method , but if done properly , usually results in a smoother emblem image . Unfortunately , it 's not the sort of method that I can just hold your hand through . The steps themselves are basic , but the final result comes down to your judgment of color . <p> The result , zoomed in . This took a bit of time , but I did n't spend too much time on it . <p> As you can see , despite what seem to be some rough edges in the zoomed version , it comes out looking pretty good at its actual size . And Elizabeth seems a lot happier with it , too . <p> There could be a better way to go about this , certainly . I 'm hardly the authority on Photoshop/image editing . This guide is n't necessarily the definitive model of efficiency , but it 's the way I know . If there 's some combination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ magnificent emblem image without any extra effort on my part , I sure have n't found it . <p> Of course , if anyone has their own method , feel free to contribute ! <p> Also , a quick shout-out to DivineOrder , for letting me use their guild emblem in the opening screenshot.

@@23370036 @3370036/ 21183 @qwx221183 <h> Philae Court/Archeology Dungeon Guide <p> One of the new dungeons introduced to the level 70 content . Unlike your generic run of the mill dungeons , it features more along the lines of puzzle solving and virtually almost no combat so hold off that OP DPS trigger itching finger . For the first timers , while it is relatively easy to follow thru the npc 's instructions , about the same time you are doing so in the quest , the clock is ticking , so in order to save you some hassle or for those simply have never done archeology before , then this guide is here to help . Despite this guide it is only the second run I have done this dungeon , there may still be need confirming such whether Crit or Zeal actually helps in the last challenge event , if there 's any additional info of tips or the guide needs some corrections , feel free the comment them . Okay now on to the juicy stuff . <p> Facts about this dungeon . -You have a 20 minute countdown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( seen as a buff icon ) . Be prepared ! -Fortunately , its actually impossible to die here . -You can talk to Elena the witch to return outside , she 's virtually on every room . -Players who have done archeology minigame will definitely be familiar with the mechanics here . -Despite the minigame suggestion and a convenient npc , you do n't actually need the archeology tools nor the pickaxe . -the dungeon resets every 6:00 ( not sure if am or pm , assume daily reset ) to gain 1 entry -this dungeon is available at Lvl65 <p> Tips : +Movespeed upgrades are recommended . +Have at least 10 free slots in your inventory . +Try to get zeals and crit up as high as you can for the last challenge ( unsure if this actually works ) +Like most dungeons DO NOT EVER RUN THIS ON THE 5:02 +Help yourself to leftovers if you like <p> Note that despite the videos , the challenges are in random order of appearance . Apply the section to what challenge you face . <p> The color code challenge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with 3 different glowing colors . It is irrelevant which color has the emblem , only that it has to match with the color of the tool on your skill bar ie. Red tool for Red glowing items . If you clicked a mismatch , do n't worry nothing bad actually happens other than you may have just been wasting your time . Keep going until you hear the announcement saying you have acquired the last emblem , then go talk to Vera . <p> Tip from eureckou <p> f you have an aoe/range skill , do n't move upon entering the room ( or else your skill bar will change ) , left-click on any glowing object then cast the spell . Repeat to the rest of the glowing objects . This will save you a lot of time . <p> The aura challenge You will need to right click and gather stuff with the green ! sign until you get the aura glow . When you do , go to the statues , 3 times for each statue , to get them fixed . Yep that 's it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carefully for glowing areas , these will be the places you need to dig . Like their World counterparts , these spots move slight away after a few seconds they reveal themselves though given the confined space , its not really difficult . Continue to dig until all crystals are powered . <p> Tip from eureckou : <p> You can actually identify each object you dig just like the normal archeology and you will gain archeology exp . This will also decrease your archeology tool 's durability . <p> However if you are pressed for time , skip identifying and just dig . The items I found identifying are n't much significance unless you really want those heroic emblems . <p> The Hording challenge Not so much really a challenge , it feels more like a bonus game . Due to the untranslated text , the best I can recommend is go after the gold and silver crown treasures above all else before Ishamel swipes them . Do n't try to race him in whatever treasure he picks , he is blazing fast to keep up . <p> The Goblins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an added twist . You will need to use 2 and 3 keys ( trap and net respectively ) to catch the goblins then attack with your pickaxe . The control for the net is similar to the meteor spell you used from the witch in her memories from the Demarech quest storyline , only smaller AoE ; you will really need to manually aim and time the catch . I recommend following this the trap skill to give you more time to strike the goblins when they 're down and it may help give you more damage . Try to get 2 or even all 3 clustered into the AoE net , as you will notice in the vid , your pickaxe seems to have a slight AoE range ( or it could actually be the effect from my envoy or wep spec , am not too sure ) . crit and zeal seems to play a part here or it could be the debuffs related on the goblins as the damage seems to vary . Also , back attacks . <p> Tip from eureckou : <p> You need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ e.g. ravager 's tornado spin ) . After the 3 goblins appeared , position yourself at the center of the 3 goblins . With the right timing , you can kill the goblins right after the challenge starts . You do n't have to chase after them . <p> Tip from AGray : <p> you can also change to necro sub for the goblins and let the pets kill them , main grenadier roboter works too <p> Personal notes:This is the best and fastest source to try and get the other masteries found only in archeology . If luck turns bad , at least you get the mysterious map pieces for them and a hefty amount of tokens as well as leveling your wep spec . <p> For Color Code Challenge : If you have an aoe/range skill , do n't move upon entering the room ( or else your skill bar will change ) , left-click on any glowing object then cast the spell . Repeat to the rest of the glowing objects . This will save you a lot of time . <p> For Goblins Challenge : You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( e.g. ravager 's tornado spin ) . After the 3 goblins appeared , position yourself at the center of the 3 goblins . With the right timing , you can kill the goblins right after the challenge starts . You do n't have to chase after them . <p> For Spotting Challenge : You can actually identify each object you dig just like the normal archeology and you will gain archeology exp . This will also decrease your archeology tool 's durability . <p> At the end of the Philae Court , there 's a violet barrier , and then the guard redirects you to the Star Sand Desert , and that 's the end of the dungeon . <p> That guard talks about the archaeologists that are stuck ( if i understood well ) beside this barrier . That 's why i thought something : What if we could use some kind of seal to release that barrier and see what 's beside it ? ( Sorry , i may do errors as i 'm french ) <p> I 'm still thinking about that barrier as well and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see if I can try to beat the clock of the dungeon on a much shorter time ( maybe less than half the time ? ) , see what happens . Another is maybe there is something more to the dungeon we might have missed among the challenges . <p> Lastly is the most technical , that the Xlegend Devs are still testing it and see how many people will actually run the dungeon . If they deem it a success , then they may update it with more content ( possibly 80+ with Gold masteries now ) . In that case , there 's nothing to do but just wait .

@@23370056 @3370056/ 21183 @qwx221183 <p> Well did n't want to start this thread with a gloom news but its important . Depending how long my mother will be staying at hospital and limited time I have before someone takes my watcher shift , my posts will be slightly delayed for a bit or even longer . <p> I will however take time to read the intro stuff when I have the time so keep posting . <p> On an added side note , depending how frequent or active people are , we may or may not need a posting order to make sure everyone 's not left out . There 's both pros and cons to this , namely between committed posting vs pacing . Well catch ya 'll later . <p> *Edelweiss - was a former small town in the mountains known for its lumber as is Skandia for fishing . The finest boat materials and herbal medicine can be found here . Town was devastated and wiped off the map after the unprovoked attack by Reinhardt 's demon army . Now Skandia carries that burden . <p> Physical Attributes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than age suggests . Very pale complexion . Most distinct appearance is her long braided skyblue hair , bright red eye and an eye patch . As guardian , physical pain is almost irrelevant to her so much she would n't even realize she is hurt until she sees her own blood , even to so much as joint dislocation . She carries a perpetual stern appearance though claims it is more of medical condition resulting to loss of nerve cells and gradually formed that face as a mold mistakenly coming off as intimidating ; she can still feel emotions but has trouble expressing it . In order to avoid too much stress on her remaining eye , she resorts to heightened hearing senses as well . <p> Personality : Freu is mature , understanding and very patient , mostly she has to be or else blood rush to her head sometimes comes off to her lost socket which would really be gross to look at and a drag to clean without the help of a mirror , this also means she can not get too excited either . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ honey badger who does n't give a crap who gets in her way . But this is n't entirely true , Freu does have a motherly side to her and does in fact , have a son to look after . Most could see this as weakness but it is actually her main source of strength ; she gave her other remaining eye so that her son could live to see . It is this same strength that gave her the will to survive after the town 's onslaught and into the wilderness up to Lunarin village and gradually Navea . She had a fondness for stuffed toys or plushies , mostly because of her loss touch of feeling . <p> These combines traits make Freu a sound leader or a second-in-command along with her honest and trustworthy nature , even though she doesn ; t these in herself and wants mostly just a mundane life , which much to her chagrin , is difficult to have for an envoy and thus always prefers the most sentimental of things . <p> Strengths : +Physical strength , both in training and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fom crashing down or ricochet a projectile with only one arm +Endurance - comes with guardian occupation along with shield and armor. +Enhanced hearing +Patience and sound judgement +Resourcefullness +Good siding with the church although not part of templar hierarchy , as such , she possess some holy type magic no average guardian possess . <p> Weaknesses : -Her left side is often her blind spot having a missing eye . -Slowed reflexes , armor does n't help much in speed . -Loved ones -Children -Plushies ; the need to cuddle something -Has not linked with Eidos often and thus has difficulty communicating them outside Alessa , though she can sense their presence as any Envoy would . <p> History : <p> Freu experienced her potential to be envoy as early as 15 but hearing how previous envoys like Sonjuno turned mad to power , she chose to suppress this ability and unfortunately chose to withdraw back from the templar recruit training in order to avoid being discovered , choosing to resign a mundane life . That self-sacrifice cost her the fall of Edelweiss but thankfully , the will of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fight and break through the demon ranks , much even to surprise of Reinhardt but her struggles were only the starting . <p> Surviving the wilderness , she came across a few survivors ; men willing to part some of their rations in exchange to be in their service . When her son recovered , he stumbled upon and witnessed her being molested . Angered , one of the men struck her son with a charred stick from the bonfire . Freu did not had second thoughts to murdering them all and set their camp blazed but in her rampage burned also their means for survival . Struggling , she went on cradling her son in her arms and reached Skandia , who refused fearing because of her bloody appearance and for fear of being the next demon invasion attack , no matter how much she pleaded . Helonia was also the same with the pirate situation . Weeks went on by and she had to resort fighting monsters with no combat experience , resulting into a lot of injury and near death until finally arriving in Lunarin village where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for treatment . <p> In Navea , the remainder of the Edelweiss survivors were also found here , most of them injured orphans . Having no one else to console to , she consented with Alessa , the earliest Eidolon she made contact with and it was decided she had to rejoined the templar ranks in order to keep her son and many others alive . Belenus at this time was present and sensed her eidolon affinity despite how little it was . She agreed under one condition that her son will be treated well . They agreed but there was little they could do for the child 's blindness for his wounds were too long and heavily inflicted , the only choice was a donor , which itself was a tricky process without much compatible individuals--the only person closest and alive to do so was her . <p> And so after medication and recovery , she resumed her training and rose to becoming an envoy , often joining as a mercenary for small time work and eventually rose to being guardian and a Sky Tower runner , most likely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ son and restore their eyesight . The church has taken to a liking to her as well , even Commander Andre despite his repercussion training another envoy . Seeing her fortitude and resolved nature reflected much her profession , it deemed fitting they could trust Freu with some of their holy magic powers in the upcoming battles ahead . <p> Astral blade : Imbues her sword with pure holy energy that can deflect magic attacks , most effective against shadow magic . <p> Light 's blessing : Passive ability to shun shadowy type debuffs but also negates shadow buffs such as boneshield from necromancer <p> Conversion : Secretive church spell that allows to channel one 's zeal ( in this case Freu 's motherly resolve to protect ) . To put simply , this is her version of Slinger 's decoy . Only works on mobs and elites <p> Echoing lament : Aoe spell that channels sweet sorrows . Targets do less damage and gradually lose the will to fight . Does not affect the will of boss but lessens damage . <p> Trivia : -Enjoys insanely spicy food though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason above , she has the bad habit of farting while asleep thus its hard to stay in a room with her . -Has a knack for tailoring and medical purposes . -Like any other housewife , she tends to be organized and loves cleaning around the house--the difference is she does it faster in a blink of an eye . -Always carries a cleaning kit -Enjoys flowers especially the Edelweiss -Can hold on her own against liquor <p> Event updates : <p> As of now she has lost envoy powers and is now unable to commune with eidolons . Her third eye power has grown however and is now capable of recalling even minute details with past events ( aka Third Eye power : Memoria ) . Friends from the Templar have allowed her some place of work , starting with a crestfallen Victoria but has gradually move to temporary Templar commander as well . Has mixed feeling with the assassin , Jack due to seeing him and Reinhardt . <p> Other notes due to lack of envoy powers : <p> -Physically weaker in strength in comparison to other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resistances are lost <p> I believe I already told this to Jack , but might as well post it here too . My main reasons for leaving include several reasons , which I will have to address ( due to seeing the sad sad state you guys think " roleplaying " is . ) <p> I have hinted a lot in the past that roleplaying is NOT similar or equal to making a story . It is quite rare to have a roleplay where each player takes more than 1-2 paragraphs per post , and do you know why ? It is because in roleplaying , YOU ARE ONLY ABLE TO CONTROL YOUR CHARACTER . If you 've actually played on serious roleplaying sites , you 'd know that you can easily be banned by doing that . <p> It is highly frowned upon by fellow roleplayers when your posts include actions that require the other party to respond himself . Each player may or may not be able to control an npc ( sometimes they can control or affect it via dice roll or an agreement that either the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certain characters . ) HOWEVER , using other people 's characters , whether you have permission or not , is ALWAYS WRONG . <p> This is roleplaying . The challenge of roleplaying is to FURTHER your character 's development via actions in a post and to further the plot , while only being limited to your character . <p> It is not the same or similar with writing a story because YOU YOURSELF ARE THE STORY . <p> I 'm sorry , yeah , this thing turned into a rant , but to be honest , I seriously feel justified to tell you that . I do not want people to think roleplaying is like this . Because that is not roleplaying . <p> It 's come to my attention some characters esp , some NPCs maybe more difficult to portray than others so a guideline for them maybe necessary . I 'll work Meleina later . And who knows , they may become an ally/enemy or even a ' boss ' . <p> Name : " Encore " <p> Age : Appears to be 30'sGender : MJob Class : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nationality : Nomadic , though originally hailed from Mushroom Forest village . <p> Physical Attributes : Stands about 6 ' 6 " . Very lean and tall . Has captivating yet shifty eyes and long flowing purple hair . Very effeminate . Comes in all sorts of costumes a collector would envy and at least three reflecting his combat tactics . He is not however the most resilient of fighters but makes up for this with tons of debuffs , evasion , deception and a plethora of magic tricks . Rarely he uses healing skills however and often , as his natural bard upbringing , hardly uses them for himself <p> Personality : Jovial and playful yet a bit of a romanticist , brings about a combination of a very charismatic and effeminate like personality that often draws tons of fangirls . He sounds like the kind of guy who you visit at a beauty salon . Whenever he could , he would love to speak in poetic accent as he is a natural actor . While he can seem friendly enough , make no mistake this can also lead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his master of disguise talent , he can also mimic other people , even women , given enough time observing their mannerisms . He has a habit also of calling special people outside his circus troupe with pet peeve names rather than actual ones , such as Pebble Princess for Freu . Why he does so is a mystery but it usually relates to the people somehow ; one could say he has a special perception or foresight after seeing their persona for awhile . Despite his rather casual and seemingly foolish nature , he does possess some wisdom rivaling those of sages ; bards do after travel far and wide than sages researching on books . Rumors are what bards are notorious for moderating . <p> At his worst , he can be the most dangerous psychopath you can come across , enough to be on par with the masters of Navea . <p> Strengths : +Reflexes and Evasion +Trickery , can even lie well enough to fool interrogators on a wild goose chase +Unpredictable ( for enemies ) +Master of Disguise +Ventriloquist ( watchout for his unique ambient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like an irregular private army . <p> Weaknesses : -Not physically resilient -Difficult to gain his trust -Unpredictable ( for allies ) -His Daughter -Often reckless -Loves to tease people often , especially the most serious ones and does n't recognize too much with authority ; he respects people who have a sense of humor though . <p> History : <p> Not much is known about his childhood past , but it is certain he had discovered the powers of Gaia and became an Envoy at some point . Being of the conjurer locals of the Mushroom village , magic is natural to him except he prefers to use it more as a means of pleasure and fun . Not long after his discovery of being an Envoy , he met and formed a group with unique talents that eventually became the carnival troupe , Soul Parasol . They had been traveling the world , spreading cheers and fascination for any to see and if often commissioned for parades in Navea . Encore during his travels adopted a lost girl named Jessica to be his daughter , who has a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much different level of magic than her father 's . <p> Some point of his career he met Freu who was back then had an early career , most likely as his bodyguard like a bouncer controlling the masses . She was one of the few women not affected by his devilish charms and it became apparent why so , when he learned she too had a child of her own . At that time , Encore was struggling a bit financially since he was just starting his business so he offered instead to help train Freu and is most responsible for her vigilant guard against treachery , acting like a second master . He does love her cooking though ; hardly any of his troupe has good cooking skills apparently , more so , does n't cause fire hazards . <p> Skills : Apart from Bard skills he also has three forms of combat based on his costumes : <p> Jester - Appears as a colorful jester with overtly huge jester hat and sitting on a bouncing ball ; his most physical attack form based on slapstick comedy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He carries a large hammer and approaches opponents on his bouncing ball which also uses as a weapon to hit and knock enemies out followed by the swing of the hammer . If range is preferable , he switches to juggling balls and flicks them in same velocity as pistols ; said balls also are used to intercept projectile shots against him . The juggler balls seem to be infinite . If it comes to slashing , he juggles chainsaws instead . <p> Magician - Gentleman-like attire with top hat and cape , this form focuses more on unpredictability and tactics . The top hat is his main weapon , which acts like a portal of sorts ; the following had been noted to come out from it : Confetti , birds ( that poo on his enemies ) , shotgun bursts , projectiles that were fired at him but got caught in the hat including magic spells , and Beirut ( Bunnyhop Boss ) with minions and a " guest star " appearance . From his sleeves comes handkerchief ropes which he uses to bind targets , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can toss between smoke or explosive bombs . The cape also has special mention ; anyone caught in it and then released will have a doppleganger clone of the target but with a cartoony/silly face . This dopple has just about as the same strengths and weaknesses as the original and it 's skills but is not as durable or lasting . <p> Peacock - Gives him the elegant form of a peacock ; this form focuses on agility and speed , giving him more hit n ' run tactic style but is just as persistently defensive due to the massive fan like tail . The tail actually consists of metal blades and often strikes at different angles , while he smoothly moves and he ALWAYS constantly moves in this form so its almost like an endless rain of knives . Attacking or disarming the tail fan maybe folly as even thick broadswords had been deflected or snapped caught in its wake . The metal also reflects light and is used to blind the opponent . He couples this form with a spear , which resembles strongly like the peacock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has also changed to have metal claws not only as a weapon but gives him grace to climb over walls and ceilings with ease . <p> Other skills that appear regardless of form <p> Cricket drone : More larger AoE type ambient drone that 's the equivalent as a clusterbomb version thanks to his ventriloquism ; can send an entire army confused . <p> Troupe : Depends largely on his forms Jester - clowns that throw banana peels to assist losing targets their balance . Magician - dancing girls/boys in skimpy outfits ; their dances are actually a martial arts of kicks and punches . Peacock - ninjas that deploy caltrops , they also provide reflective light to blind . <p> Fangirl club attack : Signaled by a whistle ; rabid fangirls attack in a zerg rush against his single target . <p> Detachable limbs and mask : Fake extensions in case someone tries to garb him by the limbs or face . Occurs only once around each body part area . <p> Trivia : -is a roleplayer , very much an avid roleplayer. -Has occasionally breaks into song and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . -Loves kids -Loves to make and tell a story , often manipulating others to do so . -Loves sweets and never can seem to get fat because of it . <p> I 've decided to write a new character alongside Astron , since he 's kind of entering his little filler arc . <p> Name : Hanamiya Yume ( chan ) ( As this is a Japanese name , Yume is her first name ) <p> Age : 19 Gender : F Height : 5 ' 6 " Nationality : ? ? ? ? ? ? ? <p> Where she came from : Like Astron , she came from another world and was forced here by the demon . However , due to certain incidents Yume has lost her memory so this section of the description can not be filled , save for the lone fact that unlike Astron , Freu , or Jack , she did not come from the World of Azuria . <p> Personality : Quiet , shy , reserved . Does n't dislike anything , and is the type of person who tries to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of criminals . Gets very excited when people turn the conversation to love , a complete contrast from her normally ( super ) shy behavior . Would rather not fight , but if forced to , then she would n't hesitate to fight for her friends . Curious : She asks a lot of questions , as a side effect of losing her memory in a sense , thus not knowing many things . She is very honest and pure , and would never go against people she trusts . The rest is confidential until she regains her memory . <p> Class : ? <p> Appearance : Like mentioned , height is 5 ' 6 " . Pretty damn kawaii if I may say so , and despite her small and slender figure is actually very bad at being able to keep balance just standing . Often wears a blue ribbon to tie her ponytail . Hair colour is dark brown . Eyes are blue . Wears glasses similar to the Fashion Glasses in-game . Her physique is not meant for combat , and thus she does not have the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Very good at understanding relationships Likeable when she actually is involved in a conversation A surprisingly good lie-detector SUPER **30;28;TOOLONG ! ! ! ! ! ! ! Her friends <p> Weaknesses : No combat abilities Next to no magic abilities Tends not to talk , sub-consciously pushing people away from her Talking to guys ( She gets even more flustered to the point that she ca n't even say proper sentences the first time ) Her friends <p> Abilities : Her only known ability : A unqiue type of magic that can change the mood of a person slightly . <p> At first , she starts off with a simple outfit with the closest resemblance to the Botantist ( F ) Hat and Crystalline Archmage robe ( F ) but with colour changes of white and blue and less reveal , so she actually looks like a wizard ( even though she is n't one . Or is she ? ) <p> Her weapon : Does n't have one . Yet . <p> Anything else : If I had to classify her , she 'd be a Dandere . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a seal on her right shoulder , nearly invisible . What could it seal , I wonder ? Plays the piano ( I had to , I love piano XD ) <p> If I do n't have to do it , I wo n't .

@@23370072 @3370072/ 21183 @qwx221183 <h> The Path Of The Support Bard <p> Hello everyone I am here to show certain players who want to follow my guide of how I build my Bard to due a lot want to know ( Please do not follow this guide if you are going DPS style ) Also this build is Bard with Sub Class Sorcerer I can point out few tips if you are going Wizard Sub if you are still going Support Style . <p> Envoy Path <p> If you look at the path this is the Support way I went to ( If You Are Sorcerer Sub Class ) <p> If you are a Wizard Sub Class feel do not worry instead of " Fire Spirit " &amp; " Song of Winds " get " Harmonic Series " &amp; " Sonic Shield " Those buffs will help a lot in your party but you might lose " Prickliness " and " Efficient Immuse System " if you want those two party buffs but those skills do have a fast cool down even though the buffs do not last long . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for you Main Skill get " Song of the Full Moon " that lowers targets Def -12% , " Callousness " which gives you Crit &amp; Crit Dmg , 4% Dmg Ballad ( THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT SKILL TO GET ) and do not use Def Ballad is very useless because people are already cap Def , " Extreme Speed " if you care about more HP and - DMG Taken get " Courage " other wise its sorta useless unless you want to be very tanky . For Tactical you can use any other the mastery to help you party members . As for Special Skill I am using " Percussive Song " aka " Song of Winds " because it gives good amount of Evasion but also 9% Movement Speed for your party members and to me that is pretty OP , however you can use " Best Defense " ( If you want to if you are not cap defense ) <p> Stat Points <p> ( I am not 90 yet but this is what you need to know so far ) Now I know what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! ? ! Well the reason why is because I went full on Tank Set " Azazel Imperial " Set . The reason why I went this set because I love to have a lot of HP but also a lot of Defense because sometimes I want to hold mobs on certain dungeons but also in ST ( Plus I love to tank ) BUT if you wish not to go this set and want to cap speed better if you can go full " Storm Chaser " that will give you more speed but down side you will lose a little HP &amp; Defense but plus side to this set you get more Healing % unlike the " Azazel Imperial " Set . If you can cap speed then you can pout all points on DMG but for me I had to go half and half which is fine to me but other players I bet hate it . Also putting points on DMG helps you heal better than Crit . As for the Defensive side go 99 on HP and the rest if up to you you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wan na cap both or if you want more HP put points on Def the more Def you have the more HP you get . Now for Accessories the best set for Support Bard get " Collapsed Empire " this set gives you a lot of Def but also HP Recover over time . Trophies well you know what you need do not look at me like that get Healing Trophies ! ! ! The two best healing trophies out there are " Ruth 's Charm " &amp; " Keres ' Wish List " the more Healing % you have the better your Healing Skills give . Next is Gagia Emblem the best one to get is Movement Speed with Heal the one I currently have is 11% Movement Speed with 2% Heal which is very good to me . <p> When you put points into your weapon path the way I did it is to get 15% Movement Speed pronto and get 20 points on to Heal = 20% Healing . Then I went 30 points on HP because you know I love being a super tanky Bard . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dmg Taken from Element Bosses and this helps a lot if you want to take less damage to element bosses . Then the rest is up to you I did Eva because I wanted to cap Eva so badly but you can put points on Speed , Dmg or Def if you want this is totally up to you guys ( Even though I did not level up my Eidolon Prayer ... Sadly LOL ) as for Right Path all i did on points was 30 on DMG , 15 on Movement Speed , &amp; rest on HP &amp; Storm Skill Dmg but you can do whatever you want it is best to max out 50/50 on both paths so you can get the extra points . <p> What Cores Should I Use ? <p> Good question the best cores to use is Full " Imperial " ( 3% Movement Speed ) now as a bard we need to be very fast so we can catch up to players to heal them in battle and also to lure mobs in dungeons and raids . As for weapons both of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this will help you to get more Healing % ( Total 20% from both of your weapons ) <p> What Element I Should Use ? <p> Well you can use Storm or Holy Element for you Harp . If you are DPS best is Storm if Support way build go Holy and as for your Sub Class get Dark for you Sorcerer Book if you are Wizard Sub get Flame . <p> What Stats of a Secret Stone is Good &amp; What Weapon ones to Use ? <p> The ones I am using is Heal with Max Hp now as a Support Bard myself its good to have a lot of HP with good amount of Healing so with your weapon and armor cores try your best to get Heal with Max Hp . Now as for which weapon Secret Stones are best to use as a Support is the one that gives you HP and that is the " Storm Secret Stone " which gives HP 10% &amp; Dmg Taken -2% get that stone on both of your weapons because this will be very helpful if you want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are many ways you can do this here are the following stats you can use : <p> 10% Max Hp 5% Heal 10% Heal <p> 5% Heal 10% Max Hp 20% Max Hp <p> 5% Movement Speed 5% Heal 10% Heal <p> 10% Max Hp 5% Movement Speed 10% Heal <p> 10% Max Hp -5% Dmg Taken -10% Dmg Taken <p> But this is the one I am currently using but like I said best star buffs is Heal , Max Hp , Movement Speed &amp; - Dmg Taken <p> Which Eidolon Should I Use ? <p> To be honest you can use anyone you want to reset the Star Buffs I gave you BUT the best ones for a Support Eidolon ( and this is my opinion you do not need to use these ) is Kotonha , Aelius , Kaiser , Athena , Serena , Diao Chan , Amaterasu , Chronos , Freya , or Medje . <p> Costume Cards <p> For your Hat Costume the Stat you can either get is 2% Heal or 2% Max HP you can pick whatever you feel like but for me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ care that much about having Heal with Max HP , Blue Card for your Hat get " Boss -Dmg Taken . " Facemask has to be both -DMG Taken/-Dmg Taken , Blue Card is " Ballad " Skill . Body Costume again -Dmg Taken/-Dmg Taken , Blue Card it can be either Healing Harmony Skill or Crit Dmg Taken from Bosses -13% ( I went with Bard Skill but it 's your choice ) . The Wings Hp/Hp , Blue Card Movement Speed 5% . As for the Costume Weapon get Dmg/Dmg , Blue Card " Healing Tones " Skill . <p> And that is it of my information about how I build my Support Bard . I did not follow anyone this is my very own build feel free if you want to try my build if not no worries this is just to give ideas out there who ever wants to be a Support Bard in this game

You know , the ones like these : <p> These are used to upgrade your skills ; ie , give them extra effects , bonus damage , etc . As of now , these specific ones can only be found in the level 45-55 zones . You can also buy masteries from your class master in Navea , by the right wing in the Military Hall in exchange for tokens . Lucky packs for non-skill related masteries can also be purchased here . You are also able to buy masteries with dragon coins , and a few dungeons have certain ones as rare drops . <p> If there is anything missing or incorrect , feel free to add on . As a side note , these were directly taken from the mob drops list , and they 're all green masteries . Additional data may be added later . Some item names are n't quite properly translated . <p> Some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name for the mastery . With the encyclopedia it 's a bit more organized since you can check which class and whatnot and it tells exactly the same info that 's posted here in the thread xdxdxd . <p> I totally forgot about that . Nonetheless , it 's a decent guide for those who are lazy to scroll and rather CTRL + F. <p> Mhm . It 's hard to do that though ' cause I do n't think all the skills are translated correctly , so it might be easier for some to check the Encyclopedia . Just wanted to mention it so Marrill could also edit her guide accordingly if she wants to via looking through the Encyclopedia. 
@@23370079 @3370079/ 21183 @qwx221183 <h> View Poll Results : What is the reason why YOU do not like to play PvP ? ( Multiple Choice ) <p> Why do n't you just make a thread " how many ppl are willing to play regularly pvp if something changed " ? If the numbers are good enough , that may please Aura xD As for me , I do n't like pvp in general , but AK pvp is maybe the worst pvp that I 've seen in a mmo . Why ? Because everything in the game is meant for pve . And that 's good ... for pve lovers . If the game was just a little oriented towards pvp it would 've had the simplest pvp modes 1v1 , 2v2 , 3v3 arena - then even if the server had only 2 pvp oriented ppl , they could 've played . Let 's face it . Just the fact that the game has some pvp features to please pvp lovers is good enough . If there are not enough pvp lovers ... well that 's the community 's fault @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ died 10 times in a row , he wo n't be stopped because his gear is still not good , he wo n't be stopped because there are better ppl than him , he wo n't be stopped because he wo n't get a prize from doing pvp . And as Aura said most of the ppl complaining here do n't even try to play pvp . <p> for flamers : i do n't  have idea if lorne now it 's still superubber , but he 's enough strong for lost 1v1. and about prizes , what 's wrong with 3k lp + 2k war coin ? you can use it for card battle and get extra 3k ... <p> @Aura : please stop with the lip service . The fact that pvp threads keep popping out is precisely because the community holds reasonable interest in pvp . Even lorn stopped posting anything , it is precisely because nothing was done to it despite numerous possible solutions . <p> You said no matter how much you update the prize there will always be people whining . But have YOU updated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before , and this fact alone speaks volume about YOUR priorities . <p> The focus of the devs is of course pve , we can see that clearly . It does not stop a private server from adding custom pvp content to keep people 's interest vested . <p> I bet my balls that the ak population in this server now wo n't even measure to 1y ago . This is because people got bored and moved to new games , many reasons but i 'd say the fact that pvp got stagnant is a big one . <p> And do n't say there 's no good suggestions for fixing pvp . There had been many , you are just adamant on your viewpoint about the fact that pvp is just generally unpopular . It is a core feature of the game that keeps people playing . People like meand many others . <p> 1 ) Do some research yourself ; look how massive is the involvement of the community in pvp related threads and how many familiar faces you see involved in this type of threads . Over and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . 2 ) The fact people does n't actually join pvp unless they feel is somehow required to advance in the game is another sign of the community general interest in the topic . 3 ) Ask around , with people outside your inner circle of playing , how many of them would be actually willing to sacrifice time in future content additions to customize pvp . <p> I 've never said I do n't think pvp is relevant , on the very opposite side , I have actively participate in any of these threads that comes out , with my opinion and reading other voices aswell , something I do n't take the time to do with every thread that pop-ups . On the honest side of things , you can not really say we have intentionally neglected this side of the game when everything we have done in at least our last year of work is following TW 's tendency in additions , and not because it was something that particularly made us more excited than the possibility of customizing content , but because it was we felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Our time and resources are limited in comparison with official servers , we can not handle all at the same time . We have been progressively adding content every 15 days - a month since , at least , March 2015 . This will be the first time since we opened , with ST Hell Mode , that we will add to the server a completely customize feature instead of some minor changes in already existing features . And no without case ; first because TW has decreased significantly the amount of introduced content , second because we still believe Sky Tower is one of this game main attractions . I have been very outspoken on our desires for this server in 2016 aswell ; we want to introduce some pve related changes ( starting with ST Hell Mode ) to have actually a justification from the upcoming +30 fortifications . Once both things are added we have mainly two focuses : one related to Envoy Changes , and something to actually put those class changes in practice , which will be pvp related changes . But yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ features and that is not a point of view , is what the majority displays . If you get about 50 people asking you in daily basis about a class that have n't even come out yet in the official server , and the same 10 players making a thread about pvp every 1-2 months , well , you do the maths . <p> Even with this poll , which is not even asking people if they want to pvp but asking why they does n't . In more than a week you only had 66 voters , and almost half does n't want to pvp because they feel you have to put too much effort in it ( Plus , most that has been written so far is more related to game drama than to the topic itself ) . <p> for flamers : i do n't  have idea if lorne now it 's still superubber , but he 's enough strong for lost 1v1. and about prizes , what 's wrong with 3k lp + 2k war coin ? you can use it for card battle and get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fun again , why ? imagine if everyone are using damned set and etc in pvp . Either u get kills or be killed , everything will be about how u play a class and not about the pvp gears . <p> If you cant make pvp gears , why bother joining ? -Some ppl maybe lazy to pvp getting 1 shot everything , and the other are similar to the first answers . ( resulting in less population in pvp ) <p> No hate , but this is just straight up stupid . You accomplish things by putting in effort . You do n't remove a whole system because people are lazy . <p> X-legend is prone to that add in stuff into the game and at the last minute forgets about it . Such as many ideas they originally had planned for Aura Kingdom but got dropped , scrapped , revamped or transition into a new idea completely . If you had noticed many unexplained things appears in any of the maps , before RainMist maps and so on . <p> just add pvp map . that will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just shout " facking noobs ! come to pvp area and i will noob your face ! " hahaha .... and add a little world Msg like " fishking style " when it appears . everytime someone kill someone in pvp map and put a lvl restriction to enter that map like lvl85.

I 'm a lvl 82 Shuriken and everytime I go to SOE on light path I 'm stuck at Sigrun . Do n't know if it has to do with the new class or not but I asked on chat , A player lvl 79 Duel with 450K GS ( I know GS does n't say much but it 's something ) while i have full set +20 except it 's not 5 stars yet only .

When boss HP is around 50% or below she will summon whirlpool and start to cast a shield every once in a while ( notice the casting animation and it 's cooldown and right click/press ESC to stop normal atk ) .

So , I am level 40+ already , but the exclamation mark icon on a scroll for special quests is still there , even when there are no new quests available to me atm .. When I click it it opens the lv 30 quest Power of Gaia , which asks me to go to the scientist at the Temple of Eidolons in Crescent Hill in order to be able to enter the TOE . I already did this at lv 30 but the quest never disappeared even tho I already completed it ... Is this a common problem ? Or just me ? <p> p.s . It happened today , I just started playing ( but came from Aeria so I know how the game works ) but it does bother me =/ <p> If I understand everything of the forum I guess this is directed to Aura , so if this is not the right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I am very happy with this private server , it is more rewarding and so much more fair than aeria , it really let 's me enjoy playing Looking forward to help in the future and will post bugs like these if I encounter them =3

" <p> I had no idea this would be the start of something amazing . <p> Deep in the magical , unknown lands of Poisonous Flower Garden ( Party Mode ) , I sit here alone . Its beautiful , iv never been here before , its so beautiful . Tiny white transparent butterflies flutter around me , as I step closer into this strange new land . The shadows of mountains and trees hang over me , entrapping me , making every small step feel like a mile , as though they are all holding me back , but from what ? The amber and chestnut trees entangle one another , flourishing in the suns basking rays . Below my feet , its like a world of its own . Carnations of PinkBlueOrangePurple , bristling slowly in the faint wind , leaving their light , subtle fragrance floating around me . There 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bees , humming along as they take advantage of the gardens blossomed flowers . Birds , gently tweeting , singing their songs of affection to one another , oh how I envy those birds , to be so free , to be free to roam the mysterious lands of Aetherion with no fear . Stone sculptures are embedded around the edges of this land , engraved with stories of the past . Its said that long ago , the tribes of people that inhabited these lands would sculpt their leaders faces into the rocks , as a sign of loyalty . Over time , the memory of those great leaders has not been forgotten , as even today , their faces remain on the eroded rocks . Ahh , what 's this ? I glance over to my right , to find myself encaptured by some small , vivid orange mushrooms . I 'm not sure if they are edible , but I do n't think I could bring myself to interfere with the serenity of this scene . <p> I move cautiously , further into this wonderland of colours , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and debris . Stepping onto the soft green grass , even in my shoes I can feel the warmth of the terrain beneath me , the scattered clusters of 4 leaf clovers , mixed betwixt the overgrown plantation . <p> Its all so beautiful , its all so wonderful , I- <p> A rustle , I look up to see a scene that , despite the beauty of it , would surely be my downfall . Iv come too far , but its too late to turn back now . I gaze up to see a swarm of bugs charging towards me , with rage in their eyes . I know what this is , this is her doing , Amaris , she 's contaminated their minds with thoughts of revenge for her own selfish wishes , these poor creatures have no control , and so , I have no choice . I Flip back , pulling out my trusty Night Star Dominion Magic Canon , charging its power to unleash upon these creatures . I hate that its come to this , these poor beings have no choice of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ destroyed , but .. My finger twitches on the trigger , as they rush closer and closer to me , huge poisonous bugs of Forest Green and Marigold , with blooming Dahlia 's gracing their foreheads , a mark of their heritage . I ca n't do it , I do n't know but why , I ca n't . My fingers wo n't move , i 'm frozen like an ice statue , awaiting my end . Its over , its too late , I 'm sorr- <p> As their leader , the Bug King , charges at me , leaving a trail of blazing crimson fire behind him , his sharp teeth emerging from underneath his giant evolved Dahlia . That 's when it all happened . <p> ? ( Part 2 ) ? <p> As the leader of this land charges towards me , blood hungry with contaminated thoughts caused by Amaris ' dark powers , I close my eyes , praying for a quick death . <p> But then , for one moment , everything stopped . Time stopped . The breeze that would usually flow between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The buzzing of the bees and songs of the birds fell silent , and in front of me , a darkness , a grey shadow covered my skin . I opened my eyes , sure that it would be the King Bug towering over me , his mouth wide open to devour me in one cruel chomp . But it was n't <p> As I opened my eyes , I saw him .. <p> A mesmerising white fox stood , towering over me , back facing me . His tail was sharp , each puff of fur sticking out like a dagger . The fur on his back , raised as though he was being threatened , as he snarled at the King Bug . I lay on the ground , unable to move , barely able to gasp for breath at such a sight . At that moment , he arched his back , ready to pounce . His sharp claws extended from his delicate white paws , digging into the ground , ready to throw himself at the enemy in front of him . Why , why was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . My mind drowned in a sea of questions , but I was too enthralled by this magical being to even start to comprehend any answers . <p> As the White Fox and The Bug Kingglared at each other , face to face , locking eyes , both determined not to back down , one finally caved . The Bug King , slowly began edging his way back . As the White Fox stood , unwavering in all his might , the Bug King slowly faded into the trees , accompanied by his helpers . I was saved , and we were now alone . <p> As I tried to regain the ability to talk , I reached out to touch his soft fur , I wanted to tell him so badly , how grateful I was . I had so many questions . Who was he , why did he save me , how could I ever repay him ? As my hand gently glided over his glistening white fur , for a moment , it seemed like he enjoyed my touch . But then , I felt him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of something dire . He hunched back suddenly , and flew with a giant leap into the trees , and disappeared into the Garden . <p> " Wait ! Please , wait ! " I cried after him . I stood up and mindlessly chased after him , pushing my way through the hunched tree branches , but it was too late . He was gone . <p> To this day . I do n't know who he was . But I know , I will meet him again some day , and I will repay him for his kindness .

So I demoted myself to spamming corrosive on people to annoy them . The problems come in when anything exists that can just cleanse off these debuffs . But by far , the biggest problem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Light and Dimensional Shot have travel time when they 're fired and thus will miss if the enemy moves at all .

Make sure you cover the entire key . &gt;Empty your wine jug , pouring everything into the bucket , do not waste any of it . Make sure that not a single drop misses the bucket . &gt;Wait until the stars and moon appear , once they do , chant a mantra in the form of your loving desire ( ex : " May love overcome , let see me as a lover .

I was traveling to Helonia and got tired after hours of walking so I sat down under a tree when someone passed by . She asked me where I was heading and I said I 'm looking for a place to stay . She said there are no vacancies in Helonia if I will go there . Many envoys had booked in already . The same with the next town . " There are plenty of rooms in Tomitsa " , she said . " But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foot and you might not make it in time " . <p> Hopeless and did n't know what to do , she offered me a silver plate fox for 1000 gold . It 's fast enough to make it to Tomitsa in time . She said she 'll send me the fox after she pays her father . So I gave her the money ( it was all I 've got from the university ) and she took off . I 've waited for hours and nothing showed up . A sorcerer fishing nearby the lake spoke , " You were scammed my child , I 've been listening to your conversation earlier " . That 's the time I realized I was fooled so I just cried . She held up my face and wiped off my tears , she lend me 600 gold and said to give it back to her as soon as I can earn more gold . She also gave me a scroll and then went off . <p> Curious on what it is , I read it . It 's a recipe on how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... small amount on skin or cloth . <p> Effects : LONG ... person who inhales it 's fragrance will tell only the truth and nothing but the truth . LONG ... scammers LONG ... <p> - One LONG ... Bottled Magic Power , for the Power ( So clever ) . - One LONG ... Willful Soul , for the Will ( Dayum i 'm so good at this ) . - One LONG ... Hero 's Emblem , for the Courage ( Cuz ofc , we need badassery ) . - One LONG ... Zaahir 's Molten Core , for the Wrath . - One LONG ... Nazrundin 's Madlstorm Crystal , for the Wisdom . - One LONG ... Miracle Cube , to contain those powerfull artifacts . <p> Item preparing : 1st Part : <p> - First step : In a melting-pot , heat up to 200C the Nazrundin Crystal using magic speels and maintain the temperature at this point until the third step . - Second step : Cool down the Zaahir Core to -200C using magic speels , and again , maintain it at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Core into the Nazrundin melted crystal ( which is pretty hard because each of them will try do beat the crap out of the other one , so be sure to get a REALLY ( I insist ) strong and sturdy melting-pot , else those troublesome Eidolons will f*cked up all the mixing : mad : . When it 's done , you teached to the " Nectar " how to exchange , even if they are totaly opposite . <p> 2nd Part : <p> - Take the Willful Soul and the Hero 's Emblem , crush them and mix them into the Bottle of Magic Power ( Shaken , not Stirred ) . After shaking the bottle , just simply add it on the the result of the first step . If all has been done correctly , the raw power will disolve the freezedmeltedcore , resulting in a pure Nectar of Gaia magic . Now , the " Nectar " can endure the next step . <p> 3rd and Last part : <p> The only component that can contain the Nectar is a Miracle Cube ( Yeah , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : cool : ) The Cube will drink up the nectar , then you will be able to keep it in your inventory for a while ( 24h , after that , take an other cube , or it will melt in your backpack : o ) <p> Effects : <p> To use this Nectar , you must first call one of your eidolon ( it works with all of them ) for example Vermilion ( The best of all &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 ) Now , we must bind you and the eidolon , it 's the same process as the Polyjuice in Harry Potter , but instead of hair we need keys ! ) So , take a Key fragment of gaia ( bind to the eidolon you called =&gt; Vermilion =&gt; Vermilion Key fragment of gaia , pure logic o ) and open the cube with it . Drink the half of the cube , and give the rest to your eidolon , the empty cube will warp out and go disturb another harmless angler o/ . Once it 's done , face your eidolon and take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and pronounce this : " For the best and the worth , until the time unbind us . " <p> Your soul , Your body , The way you think , Your habits , Your mind , all will fuse ( temporaly ) , and an Avatar will emerge , result of your fusion . All your eidolon stats will be add to yours , giving you your final Avatar stats . Your spells panel will also change , giving you powerfull skill , depending on your main weapon/the eidolon you called . The next part is up to you ( if you watched Soul Eater , or Pacific Rim , you already have a taste of what happen next ; ) ) but here is a few advice , to keep the link high and clear . <p> Side Effects : - Never say " Teemo " while transformed , or else you will have a baaaaaad time o ( juste do n't ask , IT 'S NOPE ! ! ! ! ) - No rice-cake . A single piece will bring the same effect of alcohol ( drunk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that you will see/feel what your partner really think , you 're heart-opened like never before , in the good or in the bad way ... - Don ' try to hide something to your partner , or else it will disrupt the link , and in the most worst way : A forced unfusion will happen , painfull for both linkers ( It could imply death , do n't f*ck with that ) - Drink , and link with the same eidolon too often will bring longer effects , while increasing the difficulty of maintain a clear and high link . <p> Note for the User : The more complete is your key , the more time and power you will get by drinking the Nectar . A fragment will link you for 2 days , a complete key will bring effects for months ... A full key link must be used in the most desesperate situation , and no comebacks are possible ( except the forced unfusion ) , or maybe there is a reverse nectar , but only Gaia know the recipe of it : cool : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was a dragon called " Tyrhung " . It is said that this dragon has immense power , both in terms of physical strength and magical energy . Tyrhung had the ability to manipulate all of the main elemental powers that resides all over the world . Lightning , Fire , Wind , Water , Earth , Light and Darkness . These facts was what gave Tyrhung the title " Supreme Dragon " ... <p> Written in the book called " History of the first Kingdom " ( which can be found inside the Historical Library inside Navea 's Capital ) was the first encounter with Tyrhung . It writes : " On the second day of the black sun , a great being rose from the depths of the brightberg mountain . Its size matched that of the mountain itself . Each step it took shook the earth and gave an unmeasurable presence . The people of the kingdom trembled , wept and fell prey to its death bound stare . As it spreads its massive , frightening wings , it blocked the very presence of the black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only scare a young child . It roared upon the sky which moved the clouds as if they were running away in fear . Evil enveloped the whole kingdom . Fear was felt on every corner of the kingdom , so immense that I felt like i died on that day , on that very moment ... " <p> Also written in the book was a human who sacrificed himself in order to destroy Tyrhung . That person was none other than the King of the First Kingdom , " Lord Demarech " . Demarech was the first king to be appointed in the history of Aura Kingdom . He led his people to great glory by winning against the dark wizards of the void realm that can summons demons and other monstrosity and try to wreck havoc on the lives of the people and everything residing on the world . He used his powerful magic upon the dark wizards and sealed them off from this realm . He was hailed as a hero and a king . <p> Demarech , upon gazing his eyes on the dragon Tyrhung , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human kind an all other race will be in great danger . Demarech knew that the kingdom will not be able to do battle against Tyrhung alone , so he called to the leaders of the different races around the world . He called upon the mighty makars of the plains , the dwarves ( inventors of " machines " ) , the small but powerful grass kingdom from the northern forest and the warrior tribes of the Lizard Men from the south . The world was united with a single purpose , to destroy Tyrhung which threatens the lives of everyone . <p> The battle waged on for weeks , where the united leaders and their armies fight Tyrhung and its summoned minions the argus mages . More days passed , Demarech and the other leaders are winning , they were on the very steps of where tyrhung is residing . They faced the dragon with their weapons and their will for victory . The battle was fought bravely , each of the leaders dealt powerful blow to Tyrhung , they were winning ... or so they thought . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a magical regeneration circle . Demarech and the rest of the leaders know that if the dragon succeeds in regenerating its life , all will be lost . <p> In a last effort to rid the world of Tyrhung , Demarech poured all of what magical power he has left to create a spell that would seal off the powers of Tyrhung . Upon casting the spell a wave of blue energy came pouring down from the top of BrightBerg Mountain . Everything it touched turned to a crystal , the land , the trees , the rocks , even the great lake on top of the mountain where Tyrhung rest . After the wave dissipated , the whole kingdom and the rest of the races present , saw that the mountain turned into ice . The mountain was turned into an Icy prison for those who fought the dragon Tyrhung and its minions . On that very day the dragon was defeated . Sealed in an icy tomb in the great lake on top of the mountain . Along with all those who defended life . <p> A grand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to remember the bravery of the King and of the Leaders of the other races that fought evil ... <p> Stories regarding the dragon Tyrhung vary in different places of the earth and from different races . Some saw the story of Tyrhung as a way to create a false impression on dragons that roamed the earth a long time ago . Some consider the story as truth and have invested their entire life in trying to find a way to resurrect or somehow recreate Tyrhung in another form . <p> Found by the head archeologist of Navea , was a scroll which contains a recipe that somehow resembles an elixir when performed correctly . Though not sure about what it is , She decided to consult with doctor cal from port skandia to help her with the completion of the recipe . Though unsure if it was the right thing to do , Dr. Cal , being a researcher and a scientist , agreed withe helping the archeologist complete the formula . The professor also posted a note on mirabelle 's bulletin board to help gather the ingredients necessary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ professor cal has posted , since there are not much dragons left living on earth , he has recommended that anyone who accepts the request be able to improvise or better , find a real dragon that complies with the request . <p> Step1 ) Get one of the crystal souls , one of the immortal crystal , one from rainbow diamond and one from the powere Ice Crystals . Cast a softening spell over the immortality crystals and the rainbow diamond . Once that is done , slice both of it to small sizes . Once done revert the spell casted upon it to make it hard once again . After that you now need to crush the small crystals into fine dust and after your done with it , mix the two powdered crystals with the powedered Ice Crystal . Perform this procedure on all of the crystal souls . Do n't mix them all into one , separate them . <p> Step2 ) Once all of the ingredients have been turned into fine powder . Put each mix int a separate glass bottle . Go to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One-by-one melt the powedered mixture over the sacred flames of the altar . Together with the magic infused with the flames and the necessary mixtures . Each glass bottle should now contain a concoction known as " Liquified Soul " . The souls of the beings that was melted in the fires of the argus altar retains its power and the essence of the being it came from . <p> Step3 ) Once completed and have 7 liquified souls , you must now pour all of the liquified souls into a single bottle that is enchanted with the resurrection spell . The souls must be poured in this manner : LONG ... so as to not destroy the balance . <p> Final Step ) There are two choices to perform after completion of the formula , choice 1 : Pour the Elixir on the mouth of the frozen dragon that is trapped on the top of Snowy Berg in order to revive the dragon Tyrhung or choice 2 : drink the said elixir to gain the powers of the dragon Tyrhung . <p> The effects are : DMG + 200,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DEF + 100,000 EVA + 100,000 Gives 50% chance to perform triple damage on every attack and can only occur once every 20 seconds . Additional 50% resistance on all elemental types 20% of damage absorbed as HP Anyone who have drank the elixir will be granted the ability to fly rather than glide . Flight last for 25 seconds and has a cooldown of 40 seconds . <p> I did n't mean to do it ! I swear ! I just wanted to help ... But , one thing lead to another and now ... -cry- I guess I should start from the beginning , huh ... <p> Let 's see ... I was running ( more like rolling , really ) around the Kingdom with my pokemon friends ( mainly Eevee and Cupeon ) , as usual . We were just minding our own business , doing stuff , being bored ... when all of a sudden dozens of pokeballs were being thrown at us ! They came from all different directions out of nowhere . We did our best to avoid being captured by dodging , tossing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ battle but when we thought it was all over , someone threw a firestone at Eevee ! He was lucky to avoid being evolved but still ... that was just way too close . That day , I vowed to do my very best to help him stay a shiny Eevee , cause it seemed like his everstone was n't working like it was supposed to . <p> I wandered around the kingdom trying to find a way . It took a while , but a few days ago I found a Giant Dragon 's Secret Book . LONG ... It was old and dusty , the pages yellow and the writing faded , but when I saw the words " prevent " , " capture and evolve " , " Eevees " , I knew that this spell was the one . And , thus I began to gather the ingredients . <p> So , I did what the book told me to starting with finding the " Very Large Arse Cauldron " , whatever that meant . I think I did a good job finding one , though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mountains where no one could hear you scream ... LONG ... LONG ... After that , I took a few days to gather everything and to get everything ready . I started by pouring a whole heck of a lot of bucketfuls of clean water in that cauldron , then I stuffed the wood pile and highly flammable kindling under it and lit it with my match . <p> Whilte the water heated up , I set up my elaborate trap consisting of a trap and a golden radish . It took a few days , but when Eevee finally came , I knocked him out with a syringe before tying him up with some rope and stuffing him in a small bag . <p> The journey up the mountains and down into the valley took a few hours of me rolling his fat fluffy butt everywhere . By the time we reached the cauldron , the water was already hot and ready to be used . <p> I followed the complicated drawing in the book , drawing it on the ground with the charcoal pencil , and then I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each of the points of the pentagon inside of the circle surrounding the cauldron . <p> Then , after smashing the emerald shards , jade from the deep , and jade lazuli into a fine powder , I mixed them together with the rosegold powder , stinky powder , and toxic powder . Most of it got poured onto the lines of the magic circle , which glowed a bright blue before disappearing completely . The rest was tossed into the boiling water . <p> I mixed the strange concoction for a few minutes before throwing in the suspicious soil and the strange beans . The beans quickly grew into a sickly looking plant before shriveling up in the scalding water . <p> The last things to go into the pot were the wing scale dust , the catalyst powder , the bottled purple lotus , the magical energy water , and the murmuring holy water . They turned the water sparkly pink , then deep purple with swirls of glowing green , before changing it to a lava looking mixture . <p> A bit more mixing ... and voila @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole thing but ... -lazy- I just tossed him in and hoped that that was okay ... <p> LONG ... LONG ... Before long , a dark purple cloud engulfed him .... LONG ... LONG ... There was a loud BANG ! An explosion of epic proportions knocked me off my feet and tossed me a few meters away . What I saw when I came to shocked me so bad ... Eevee turned into a Vaporeon ! LONG ... LONG ... <p> Let 's just say that he ... or rather ... she was n't happy with what happened . <p> ( Effect ) : I guess in a way , the spell/potion/whatever the heck its supposed to be actually worked . People stopped throwing firestones and what not at her , but then again ... she 's fully evolved now ...

Though , I knew that finding a guild was the main aspect to get help from people . <p> When I chose guilds , I usually went for a smaller one because I felt like I would n't fit in with the crowd . I mean , they were all so tough and experienced . Whod want a new beginner like me in a good guild ? However , I decided to take my chances and choose random guilds . <p> First one was a dud .

So , going against my brain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wo n't like you ! , I joined a larger guild : <p> Valkyria . <p> This guild .

Either it was teaching me how to play Aura Kingdom correctly , running my first ever Sky Tower with me , helping me get Eidolons , or even just hanging around the Guild Hall after their weekly summonings and talking . <p> When I joined , I was flooded with welcomes from everybody , and I felt so relieved . You know what the first words I said in that guild were ? <p> " Fight me . " <p> Yeah , that 's right . Great conversation starter . They jumped right in , though , and started to talk about how they were actually going to fight me .

Though , the ones Ive connected with the most while I was in Valkyria are these few individuals : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> These four people were , honestly , the ones to break my outer shell and let my true self shine . I had gone through a really rough point of someone I loved a lot leaving this world , and I turned to games and my abrasive side to get through it . <p> However , they stuck with me as I was breaking down my shell . Even if I switched moods from happy to angry on a dime , they still were there for me . <p> And then we hit Raid Call . I was nervous to let them hear my voice because , at the time , I was extremely insecure about my voice . Many people said I sounded like a guy , so it eventually got to me so bad that I would n't talk at all online . <p> Still , they stuck with me and coaxed me out of the shyness and insecurity and led me to talk .

Anything in the world . <p> It does n't  work like that , sadly , but I 'm content with the little memories Ive stored over the months I 've been here in a small file in my heart . <p> Valkyria , you 're the best guild Ive ever been in and will always be .

But Liyrical can not , for the life of her , remember how warm her mother 's hand felt like , or the sound of her father 's supposedly beautiful voice , or so said by the townspeople . <p> They say she looked just liked them , had her mother 's gold eyes , coloured brightly but were shaped like her father 's instead , soft and kind , they tell her . They say she looks just like her mother , but has the soft , silky locks of her father 's pink hair . They say she acts just like him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apparently brash , loud . <p> But they fell in love anyway . <p> ------ <p> Liyrical wonders what they were like . <p> But Liyrical 's not lonely , not really . Sheila is like her mother , or at the very least , her guardian . And Anita 's always kind to her , the plump woman always is , and Corey , occasionally annoying and eccentric he is , is like an older brother . Betsy could be considered her older sister too , Liyrical thinks . <p> But it 's not enough sometimes , and she knows this . Liyrical has caught herself , staring at the way Sheila looks at her own blood children and maybe , just maybe , wishing she was part of the family too . <p> But she is n't . <p> She 's far too distant , and most of Sheila 's children see her not as an older sister , but a friend , young one , of their mother 's . York does n't think of her as a daughter , and Corey , Betsy and Anita all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever will for her . <p> But she takes the feeling , envy , jealousy , anything negative that runs through her , and shoves it down till she can only hear a soft buzz of what the emotions used to be . She ca n't let herself hate , or else <p> She wo n't have anything else left . <p> ------ <p> The ocean breeze blows a chill , crisp air through the town and Liyrical shivers slightly , protected thinly by the simple clergy cloak she wears , gifted to her by Anita on her 18th birthday . <p> It 's January now , however , and the air is cool , and she has n't been sleeping well , not yesterday night either . The dream was strange , even stranger than all the ones before . <p> Because , it seemed real . <p> But then Willie whacks her head and she 's out of her daze , barely listening to Willie , who 's scolding her , but she ca n't hear him clearly , because her head hurts and there 's a ringing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Liyrical takes a deep breath and pinches the space between her eyebrows and the pain and ringing stops . <p> " ... so go ahead and meet with the Chief 's wife and Oi ! Hey , are you even listening ! ? " Willie shouts and Liyrical , too annoyed to care that she 's technically disrespecting her superior , regardless of whether her superior is Willie , waves a hand and sighs . <p> " Yes , yes , I heard you . I 'll go meet up with Sheila , alright ? There 's no need to be so uptight , Willie . " She replies , running her fingers through her straightly-cut across hair , messing it up . <p> Willie sighs and speaks , " Do n't sass me Liri , you 're the one who forgot to give Sheila the merchandise . " <p> Merchandise ? What merchandise ? What is Willie talking about ? Sheila had ordered merchandise ? When did that happen <p> And then Liyrical blinked blankly in realisation , and mumbled a quiet , almost silent , " Oh shit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remarks , voice sing-song and smug upon seeing the expression on her face , and snorted . The sound made Liyrical break out of her thoughts and she glared at him , mouth turning downwards . He simply grinned back at her , and her frown had turned into a scowl within a moment 's time . <p> ------ <p> " I 'm really sorry Sheila , I ca n't believe I forgot about your order . " Liyrical apologies , voice ashamed and embarrassed , but Sheila just smiles back , and waves off whatever more apologies Liyrical was going to spill out of her mouth . <p> " It 's fine , you 're always sincere , and a mistake like this is n't that big either , so it 's fine dear . " Sheila answers . " I 've heard you have n't been sleeping well . Are you alright ? " Sheila asked , tone worried and eyebrows furrowed together , causing the wrinkles on her forehead , a clear sign of her aging body to be even more obvious than before . <p> Liyrical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her eyes . " Hopefully so . " She says , almost a whisper . Sheila is obviously still worried , the lines on her face sinking even deeper , but she let 's the subject drop , Liyrical 's discomfort with the topic obvious . <p> " Well then , you can make up to me by passing these jars of jams that just arrived from port , " Sheila walks over her spot and unpacks one of the cardboard boxes laid untidily around the front lawn , and picks up an average-sized jar of berry jam from the cointainer , and holds it towards Liyrical . " Take these and pass them to the merchants around the village . " Liyrical nods as she picks up a box of the supplies , when Sheila suddenly asks . <p> " Liyrical , have you seen Joel ? I ca n't seem to find him . " Her tone is of irritation , and Liyrical thinks , as hard as she can if she 's seen Joel at all during the past few hours , and shakes her head . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 'm sure he 's fine , probably played out for too long . I 'll ask around and see if anyone has seen him , however . " Liyrical answers , moving her head slightly to brush her long strands of hair off her shoulder . <p> Sheila sighs , and Liyrical can hear the age in her voice , old and tired and far too exhausted . <p> The walk to the town is short , 5 minutes at most , and the jars of jam in her hands are n't that heavy either . She sees Anita and walks to her , and Anita beams when she sees her . <p> " Hello Liri ! " Liyrical rolls her eyes at the nickname , Willie had said it once , saying her name was a mouthful and the nickname had stuck ever since then . Only Sheila does n't use it . <p> " I see you 're helping Sheila in delivering goods , oh , you truly are a garrison member now . " She languishes , as Liyrical passes a few jars of jam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a while . <p> " ... either way , you 're now an adult and maybe you 'll traverse the world and " Anita 's cut off when Liyrical coughs into her fist , and the jolly woman chuckles in embarrassment . <p> " Anita , have you seen Joel ? " Liyrical asks , but is disappointed when all Anita replies with is a shake of her head , " I 'm sorry Liri , I do n't think I have . That itself is odd , he usually drops by here , but I have n't seen him all day . " Liyrical frowns at that , but gives Anita a goodbye wave and makes her way towards Betsy 's stall . <p> The stall itself is small , but filled up with various pieces of armor , some leather , others chainmail . <p> Betsy catches sight of her , and brightens considerably . <p> " Liri ! How have you been ? " She greets , chirpy . <p> " Fine , or at least as good as I can be . Have you seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a jar of jam to Betsy . <p> Betsy picks up the red , coloured by the berries , jar of jam and frowns , as Liyrical remembers that Betsy dislikes sweet jam , preferring it sour and salty , an odd combination , but Liyrical does n't judge . " No , I have n't , but I saw him yesterday . " Betsy adds , as if such information was useful . <p> Slightly frustrated , Liyrical leaves off in a hurry to Corey , desperate to find anymore knowledge of Joel , if anyone has seen him . <p> When Liyrical gets to Corey 's stall , where he 's about to greet her , she slams the last two jars of the jam onto the wooden table , creating a loud , ' thump ' sound , causing Corey to recoil at the force of the sound , and attracting the attention of a few of the elderly . <p> " Have you seen Joel ? " Liyrical says in a rush and Corey shakes his head vigorously , sweating nervously at Liyrical 's glaring . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrong ? " Corey asks , eyes confused and worried . Liyrical props herself up onto the desk of the stall , sighing . " Joel 's been missing all day , no one 's seen him around . " At this , Corey 's eyes widen . <p> " Are you sure ? Maybe he 's around town somewhere ? " Corey asks . Liyrical shakes his head . " Sheila had searched all over town , she did n't find him . " <p> Liyrical crushes it , like the pessimist she is . " Doubt it , Joel never stays out for so long . 2 hours at most , longer than that ? He 'll burst out in tears . And we will be able to hear his obnoxious crying . " Corey looks troubled , but Liyrical thanks him anyway , and she walks back towards Sheila . <p> When she gets back , Sheila looks hopeful , too hopeful but Liyrical is n't a liar , but hates the way Sheila face starts to scrunch up in worry when she says that none have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same moment it appeared and Liyrical has to admire the woman 's strength , as Sheila digs through her hand and pays her 10 silver coins in compensation for her efforts . <p> " I 'm going to look for Joel again , alright ? Please send this , " Sheila hurries off into her home , there 's the sound of shuffling of feet , and Sheila 's back again , this time with a blue cloth-wrapped lunch box , and passes it to Liyrical , " To York . He 's currently at the lighthouse , if I remember his schedule correctly . " Liyrical nods , but before the pink-haired girl can even get a word out , Sheila has already placed a few silver coins into her hands and scurried off , house not even locked . <p> Liyrical sighs . ( She really needs to get a better job . One that does n't involve running errands. )

You do n't need to make something physically impossible to make a rule @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when reported . <p> Coming from a player who recruits for st , one of the main reasons I use trade chat is because of the lack of megaphones . Each week , a single account is given a chance to buy only 50 megaphones with lp . Now try imagining recruiting for st and sf ( a span of 3 days ) with only 50 megaphones . It 's near impossible , and I 've honestly ran out of megaphones in several occasions . <p> If the number of megaphones you could buy with lp was higher or something , I would gladly leave trade chat alone . <p> I think spamming trade chat is invasive as its sole purpose is for buying and selling items , not spamming recruitment . But World Chat is there for the spamming and easy to turn off . <p> Pro tip : also buy the megaphones from the limited section in the AP shop . <p> Protip : I wish I had ap <p> Anyway if it really annoys people , I do n't mind .

" As you all know Skytower-Raid is being held at 8pm servertime . Its been more than an hour of continued spam in the world chats with about 10 guilds trying to lure players into their raids . There is no way to talk using the World-Chat anymore and even the trading-channel is wasted that way i have to switch to other channels to read wispers that are being tossed out of the chats history way to fast due to those spammed invitations . Also several guilds are advertising with nudes of their members which is intended as a joke for sure but leaves a bad taste . Some guilds go as far as using multiple players to advertise the same raid , each with the same or sometimes alternating message . <p> The spamming takes new levels as other players join in spamming " STOP SPAM ! STOP SPAM ! " in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I would like you to consider possible ways of making them calm down before such raids . Thinking about it i got some possible solutions : -Raids are to be advertised within a timeframe of 1hour before the raid . -Invitations should be send at a rate of 1 a minute or lower . Everything else is considered spam . -Trade channel is non-guild area . <p> Possibilitys that need some work : -Creating a additional channel " Raid-Recruiting " " PR-Work " or such . <p> I started writing this after searching for possible rules speaking against such behavior . There is n't any rule disallowing spam . Some of the messages scratched those two though : 1 ) Game and Forums Content must stay all ages-appropiated . The use of sexual explicit content and offensive language may end up with your account being terminated . 2 ) No Discrimination Allowed : Any kind of discrimination remarks will end up with your account being permanently banned . Players must be respected regardless of their nationality , sexual orientation , religious beliefs , etc . <p> Promoting nudes and offering the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like to be made fun of in such a way .

And yeah as said you can have up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can have more efficient chats anyway so your whispers etc important things wont disappear . <p> and at first that would sound awesome to have a st recruit tab too , but " smart " players would still spam on world chat too so it would in the end be useless .

" The guard spat out the word human . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a murr of amusement . <p> " Really ? Well ... We might have something such as that . We have strong healers and a bountiful of herbs in our land . Human ! If you beat me in a battle , then I will let you take as much herbs as you want and possibly let you take one of our healers with you until the job is done ... However , if you loose ... Then you shall walk out of our land empty handed . Strength is everything to us , and if you can not respect our way of how we do things in our land ... " The prince trailed off with a serious look on his face . His dark brown mane bristling as a growl rumbled in his throat . <p> " I accept your duel then ... " Without much choice , I accepted . The Makar prince calmed himself and a smile curled on his feline lips . You felt the cold bar of the guards axe slowly remove and saw as he nodded to you for approval , still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and walked the stares , facing face to face with the young prince . " Show me your strength ! " The prince snarled as he held his large axe , prepared for battle . Feeling a bit uneasy , I sighed . Relaxing , I cleared my mind and charged forward , raising my sword up and slashing it downward only to clash against the prince 's axe . I pressured down my sword with more strength and with a grunt from the prince , I felt him lean back a bit . A split second later I saw claws rushing toward my face and ducked , sliding my sword down with me . As I turn to face the prince , he raised his axe and aimed it at my chest as it came raining down on me . <p> " Hey ... " My whole body felt numb and the only sight I could see was a small twinkle of light . <p> " You might of lost the battle ... But it does n't mean you should give up . Do not blame yourself for not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in might be cruel with its rules and creatures that live in it . However , when you think about it ... It is still quite beautiful . Please , enjoy it while you still have it Rein ... " Lucfa 's sweet voice rang around me , but started to slowly fade away towards the end . <p> " L- Lucfa ... Please , do n't go ! " Suddenly , a faint image of her appeared in front of me . She had on a sad smile before slowly reaching and wrapping her ghostly spirit arms around me . Only a faint , quiet whisper could be heard . <p> " You ar- my pre- -us ... " Hot tears run down my face as the vision of her spirit and voice had slowly faded out of sight and I was left with nothing else but darkness . <p> " Lucfa ... N-No ... LUCIA ! " I silently screamed . <p> You are my precious ... Do n't ever forget who you are ... <p> ( Navea : 535 , 661 ) It was such a happy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... I thought to myself until I could feel a burning sensation all around me . Fire lashed out before my eyes as I saw myself walking toward the front of the Church of Navea and getting an aerial view of what was going on . <p> " You monsters ... You killed her ! You did n't even help me save her ... Why ! ? I did everything for you people and you take my only joy away ! " I could hear the anger and sadness in my voice as I spoke , feeling the rage and heavy load I bared back then . It felt like a choking pain in my chest , as if everything inside of me was scraped out and replaced with nothing but this overwhelming sadness and hatred . <p> " Reinhardt , what are you talking about ? We would never do such a thing ! Why would we even do that ? " It was Andre who had spoken . He was protectively standing in front on Belenus with the other guard next to him . <p> " You ungrateful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you everything you know ! Without me , you are nothing to them . You are just being used like a little dog that knows nothing but a few simple tricks ! " I heard myself spat back in anger . <p> " Enough child !

You wo n't win if you try to fight your way up here ... You our outnumbered ! So turn back and leave , now . " Belenus spoke up in a raspy voice . I saw myself grit my teeth in anger , my eyes reflected nothing but pain and suffering as I turned my back to them in defeat . <p> " I will be back ... Stronger than before and with my own army ... Soon , we will be the ones that outnumber you . I will take back what was once mine whether it 's the last thing I ever do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the raging flames around me and disappearing . Soon , darkness took place again and I could hear a faint voice ringing around me . <p> " I Love You Rein ... Please do n't forget that . " <p> ( Silent Ice Hill : 398 , 236 ) Crunch , Crunch ... Sound of snow crumbling under my feet was heard as I stopped in my tracks and started at the castle-like structure before me . Dark creatures surrounded the bridge leading up to it , guarding the path that lead to the gates . I kneeled down , feeling my silvery long locks brush against my shoulder and cheeks . <p> " I will bring you back Lucfa ... We will be happy again like we were before ... Nothing is going to stop us from being together this time . Just wait my love ... " I whispered to myself . After remembering the past , I felt a new burning passion welling up inside of me . Whether it was out of love or hate , I did n't care ... It gave me the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get her back . I glanced down at the land below the bridge . To one , it would seem like a desolate wasteland , but to me ... Under this castle and past a few chambers was where I had buried her ... To me , this is an important place . If anyone dares to ruin it , I will hunt them down ... <p> " I 'll be back soon my beloved ... I 'm sorry this visit was short , but there are a few things I must first do ... I promise next time I will be here much longer and talk to you more ... " I slowly got up and opened a void of darkness . Walking into the void , I felt a stray tear run down my cheek as I heard a familiar faint , sweet voice ...

( Multiple Choice ) <p> I started creating an alt just for PvP ( costumes , cards , stones , stat , etc . ) . I am too eager to get to level 80 and I farm for VC ( cellar ) and WC ( Ultimate fighting ) everyday with my 3 chars but later on I got bored with the daily grind so I stopped and tried queuing only to find out that nobody plays PvP anymore . Haha .. I should 've listened to FreuFreue before . XD <p> You forgot to mention those players who are PvP-geared but refuse to attack someone on the other team because " b-but they 're my **31;649;TOOLONG . " <p> Reminds me of Hya , Nell and Holycrys , three typical Crusaders from " Legend " . Saw it couple of times already .

That 's a lame excuse tho , some classes are better in pvp , but that does n't mean it 's impossible for any other classes . The biggest problem in my opinion is suitable gear . My gs is around 140k-180k atm at lvl 74 ( I could get it higher if I tried , but not much ) . My gear ca n't keep up with my leveling , so I end up having low leveled gear . I do n't mind getting killed in pvp , I do that pretty much everyday so it 's nothing new . The problem is , however , that I feel like I 'd just slow my team and be a burden if I played . This is the reason why I do n't even try to get any pvp gear . <p> I played in os for about a year ( got stuck at lvl 64 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like to tho , but I always feel like I 'd just be useless . <p> I was going to try to get into PvP seriously , but already the grind to get good gear is starting to get old . But what really discourages me is the fact that it seems like you have to be an elitist in order to stand a chance . You have to be really serious about doing this , players with pots , chocolates , sage stones , eido buffs , 5-stars on all their gear , capped eva . Not to mention I 've seen some sorcs and katars that are near impossible to take down . And , if the opposing team is like that with a bard , it 's even worse . Albeit , I 'm built for PvE , and I went in there with less than the best PvP gear , but still , it 's disheartening how fast you go down in there .

I think a lot of people just throw themselves in for the LP . <p> 1 .

@@23370158 @3370158/ <p> A lot of people , including me , obsesses about eidolons with +25% atk spd 1* buff because it is very useful . The down side of it though is that it limits you so much on choosing your eidolon . Well , not anymore ! This item really helped me spice up my subclass choosing more for I do n't have to be forced to use a subclass that has spd buff like gunslinger or warbow to hit my Katar 's max atk spd . <p> ( I use it everytime against bosses ) <p> Let 's face it guys . A lot of us have been ignoring these items and now I decided to share it with you on how useful it is , and quite simple to make . <p> **TIP : You do n't literally have to use it all the time . There are times that your party will be very strong that everything dies so quickly . It 's best to stack them just in-case you 're a person like me who likes to tryhard and carry lil puggies in dungeons . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It would be a waste to put all these effort for a very easy dungeon unless you can craft a lot of these . <p> **And if you did change your build cuz of these items and you 're like " wat 's the point if I wo n't use them that much anyway ? " , well no worries . PvE is ezpz . With a decent build , party , brain , and nocturnal , everything is a-ok . <p> Kitero <p> 02-02-2015 , 10:49 PM <p> Omg .

I 'm not exactly sure how you can use one every time you fight a boss or lure mobs , but you 're eventually going to run out of tokens to buy fragments with unless you love questing . <p> Hmm , I guess I overstated " very simple to make " because in my case , I had a bunch of Tokens by doing vp and sb dailies and still a bunch of ' em on mi alts . And in overall game time a day , I think I only run 4 hours of dungeons or 2 sets of 3x + 1x tr/cs/fh pt and hell . <p> But if we were to look at semi-new players , I guess it would be quite difficult for them .. Gon na edit the post to look less exaggerated . <p> Oh well . It was a mere tip that was pretty effective for me . I hope it helped some others too . <p> ElynaRose <p> 02-03-2015 , 06:05 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ using it ( - ' ' - ) I mean why would use it if only 1 minute ? Or is there any upgraded version ? <p> Or use it like trump card when facing deadly bosses ? Just like what some heroes do to power up in the middle of boss fight <p> wo <p> 02-03-2015 , 06:26 AM <p> do n't get addicted ! <p> Shiohara <p> 02-03-2015 , 06:36 AM <p> No . By the same logic you could also spend extra time to always have someone with gunslinger buff in your party but you do n't bank on that because it 's highly unreliable , the same applies to these potions hence why no one bothers using them . The eidolons that do give 25% a.speed are simply better not only because of the 25% buff but look at Eligos with his -1,3k skill and 16% dmg bonus or yarnaros 16% and great offensive stats with S+ in dmg and A or A+ in the rest of the offensive stats or Bel Chadra with 15% flat crit and the best party buff in the game . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dmg 25% a.speed AND a 20% movement speed buff which applies to the entire pt . When there is a better and more viable option , I do n't see the reason to use the attack speed potion where I can only have optimal dps out in certain situation , what will you do in ST ? Although using 3 star sabertooth tigerus with the potion is legit because Tigerus is love . <p> Chiriko <p> 02-03-2015 , 10:46 AM <p> Meh no , this item is situational and have very limited supply . It need effort to make : gathering + questing . 1m is very short , especially for those who do dungeon . This item is intended for supplement only and not permanent solution . But yeah , ca n't be hurt to craft those , especially in emergency , those item can saves your life when doing centu or killing reinhardt . <p> Teatime <p> 02-03-2015 , 10:57 AM <p> Did u have try make rank A and see if get orange recipe ? <p> futugawu <p> 02-03-2015 , 11:31 AM <p> noooooo ! ! ! daily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Shibi <p> 02-03-2015 , 11:37 AM <p> -snip- <p> Did u have try make rank A and see if get orange recipe ? <p> Yeah but no there 's no orange recipe for these sadly xD . Would be op tho if ever oO . <p> FreuFreu <p> 02-03-2015 , 02:01 PM <p> I see the two items mostly as convenient purposes at best . Imperials will still dominate for ... well being always in effect . We do n't really need a movespeed higher than 300% though unless you have a super processing computer .. I mean just try a mount in flight and you will notice a drop in FPS is huge . <p> For most dungeons , we probably just need movespeed to rush or at least catch up to the ones who do . At best , you will need them to dodge red carpets becuase your HP pool is just too low even with enough def . <p> Fast atk speed potion might had been viable if it could had lessen cooldowns . Or at least make both potions last 5 minutes . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given so far by Serena ( +heal% and one that makes you invisible for a certain until 6 minutes or when you atk. ) but they have no recipe and may only be exclusive to Serena box . <p> Still , I think , like the stat potions before sage stones came , these potions are just the prelude for something better--it just does n't have extra game content to traverse them from lame 1 minute situational items they are now . 
@@23370159 @3370159/ 21183 @qwx221183 <h> PvE Aceline 's life of a support Bard/Sorc <p> I. Introduction <p> Hello , it 's me Ade ... I mean Aceline . I 'm well aware of the fact that DPS bard is more effective in our current meta . However , I still want to share this guide to the people who want to stick with the support life for whatever personal reason , so please refrain from commenting something along the line of " support sux go dps " kk C : <p> II . Pros and Cons of this build <p> Pros - - Can act as a soft tank . - Utility from sorc sub . <p> Cons - Low dmg output comparing to dps bard . - Not an immortal tank god . - Can be discriminated against in some cases because it 's out of meta . <p> III . How to roll <p> Here is an overview of what my build looks like <p> A. Stats <p> Offensive DMG : Put all point to DMG because the more damage you have , the more you can heal . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better crit heal . Ideally , you should aim for 50%+ CRIT . SPD : No point in speed since you can cap speed alone with gear and eido prayer . If your prayer is low , you can consider other outside buff such as food/drink , party buff ( not very reliable since you do n't always have spd buff in a party ) . If you ca n't still cap speed then take some points off DMG or CRIT . <p> To sum it up : Cap SPD . Get 50%+ CRIT . The rest goes into DMG . <p> Defensive HP : All point in HP because this is the proof of your tankiness ( lol ) . DEF : The rest of points goes here . EVA : No point in EVA since you can cap it easily thanks to Keres trophy . <p> B. Envoy <p> My current envoy path <p> Crit and Crit DMG tiles are for the purpose of crit healing . <p> I do n't take Efficient Immune System because it requires you to get hit in order to proc , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't get hit that often . Besides , you already have a cleanse from sorc sub , so the envoy tile is n't that necessary . <p> As for Fire Spirit , I simply do n't find it useful enough to take . <p> C. Masteries <p> Song of the Full Moon -12% DEF . Adding up with Storm Song Mastery from envoy , you can now constantly debuff your enemies in a wide area . <p> My point allocation serves the purpose of increasing healing capacity . <p> E. What to do with Sorc sub <p> - Cleanse party members with Mantra as often as possible . - Controling mobs with Totem . Do n't take on too many mobs more than your party can handle . - Boost party 's move speed with Percussive Song . - Void Mantra cleanses 2 debuffs at a time , gives more Heal-Over-Time than normal Mantra , and also provides +6% DMG . Use it wisely . <p> No matter which weapon you pick for your end-game setting , a 5-star main weap is a must . Go big or go home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Restorer core for extra heal % , and Protector core for ... well , protecting allies . As for elements , storm for harp and dark for book , because any other element is either useless or not very useful . <p> I have n't got my hands on lv85 harp so I ca n't really tell if it 's a must or not . It gives more damage , more HP , more duration on ballad , but you 'll miss out 10% HEAL and -5% dmg taken from bosses and elites . Theorically you gain more than what you lose . However if you decide to stick with lv80 weap , it 's still a good one to go by . <p> As for secret stones , go with Storm Secret Stones with 3% HEAL and either -2% Damage Taken or 6% CRIT DMG . I 'm using Lava Stone in the pic because I have a sorc , and I want to save money wherever I can . <p> About enchantment cards , go with move speed ones . The other stat can be anything because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( Again , I use zeal mspd card on the grimoire because I have a main sorc ) <p> I recommend going with Imperial core . The faster you run , the more time you save when clearing through dungeons . You can mix in some Bestial , depending on whether or not you 're comfortable with your move speed . <p> You can pick whichever enchantment cards that increase the stat you lack . If you 're too low on crit then go with CRIT/CRIT , HP too low because of no 5-star armor then go with HP/HP , etc . I use DMG/DMG since I feel comfortable with my other stats though . <p> For secret stones , try to find the ones that have 3% HEAL and -2% DMG Taken . The important stone parts are : <p> The accessories are where your crit comes from to perform crit healing . War Exemplar set gives DMG and CRIT , while Arcane set gives SPD and slightly more CRIT . <p> I went with War Exemplar because I do n't need Arcane 's bonus SPD to cap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ benefit me as a support bard . <p> As for enchantment cards , just go with whichever stat you need . <p> D. Trophies <p> These are the only viable options for a healer . 35% HEAL ftw ! <p> E. Heraldies <p> I 'm using the above heraldy as my permanent . If you feel too squishy , you can go with one that has -6% DMG Taken . Other option is something with 6% HEAL if your HEAL % is too low ( not sure if I 've ever seen a 10% HEAL ) . <p> F. Eidolons <p> For a more active/offensive situation , use Cesela with her original buffs . She gives 60% Crit DMG and 8% DMG , which adds a lot to your healing . Defensive eidolons include Vermillion , Bealdor , Astraea , Diao Chan with their original buffs . <p> If you want to reroll , try to roll an eidolon with similar stats to those listed above . The eido choices for this option are : <p> - Aelius/Rhodri/Nikki : They offer a cleanse similar to Rejuvenation Mantra. - **26;796;TOOLONG : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skill . - **36;824;TOOLONG : They have a noct skill , which can benefit the party in some cases ( particularly at 1st boss in TJ ) . - Kaiser Zeta/Bahadur : They have a skill that reduces dmg taken for the whole party by 20% . <p> G. Costume Enchantments <p> Go tanky anywhere you can , except for the costume weapon since it does n't have tanky option . <p> V. Let 's play ! <p> I 'll try to include some basic barding stuff that new bards need to know . <p> The Green Notes - Tunes of Harmony . <p> The more green notes you have , the higher heal % you gain . Three green notes give you 24% extra heal % . They also allow you to cast your **29;862;TOOLONG as an AoE . The more notes , the bigger the AoE . At 3 stacks , you can easily heal half of the entire ST floor with one single Holy Notes . So remember to attack repeatedly to gain 3 green notes before casting a Holy Notes or Healing Harmony . <p> Speaking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be as big as Holy Notes , but its benefit is too hard to ignore . It gives an extra 5% detail dmg to whoever received the heal for 10s , i.e. the people who are within range when you cast the AoE Healing Harmony . <p> Ballad <p> Being a bard is n't limited to only spamming ballad . It 's true that you need to keep up the 3 stacks , but spamming it non-stop only proves how bad and clueless you are . You just need to refresh the stack every 10s . Use the time in-between to apply Storm Song on boss/mobs or look out for party member with low health . <p> When to use what skill <p> - Holy Notes is an insta-cast emergency heal . You should use it when a party member is extremely low and at risk of dying in the next few seconds . - Healing Harmony has highest heal amount but has a channeling time , unlike Holy Notes . You should use it after casting Holy Notes to restore a person to max health . - Healing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can use this skill to heal your whole party when they get hit but nobody is in danger of dying . I also use this skill to heal myself ( I have enabled the Self-Cast option in Settings &gt; Functions ) when I 'm busy focusing on someone else . <p> VI . Ending <p> I may forget to include some information here and there . If I do miss something , please feel free to let me know . <p> Also , thanks to my fellow Hyperion gang for some " in-depth " discussion about the topic of barding ( ? ? ? ? )

But a brave young noble risked life and limb so that the silent gunsmith would hear of their predicament . <p> The noble youth , however , fell for the fallen knight 's trap , and suffered a fatal wound . But he pressed on , and delivered the message , before his life ended . <p> The silent gunsmith rushed towards the school , his guns in his holster , his thoughts filled with sorrow and pity . Shooting down the barricades that the fallen knight had built , the knight 's henchmen were killed of in a single blast , and he turned to face the fallen knight in mortal combat . It was then that the silent gunsmith held him at gunpoint , the silence of his anger quelling the rage of the fallen knight . <p> With his artistry and flair , he rallied the man , brought him back to the right path , and protected his honor as one of the school 's greatest of warriors . Having vowed to never let an incident @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the silent gunsmith threw away his guns , and vowed to only fight with his fists , until he believes he is ready to wield a weapon once again and is now known as the raging fist of the angry waves . <p> Love and War Arc After the establishment of the school council , numerous envoys sought refuge of the school 's unique system . It was then that one of the core members brought one man often called the pinnacle of strength . He was the lover of the idol of the school . Bringing with him great wealth and power , he pushed the school to it 's limits and greatly improved the students ' combat capabilities . He soon became a proud member of the 2nd council of Crescent Hill . <p> During their many combat training regiments , the guild encountered the rumored fair maiden of the east . The fair maiden of the east was enamored by the sight of the raging fist of the angry waves , and she vowed her fealty to him through the sacred kiss of oaths , a magical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other . <p> However , such oaths were always full of temptations . The school idol and the pinnacle of strength had numerous breakdowns . The school idol went to the raging fist of the angry waves for comfort , and a forbidden love formed between the two . <p> Upon hearing this , the pinnacle of strength exploded with anger , and challenged the raging fist of the angry waves against a duel for the school idol . The two faced in battle , fist against fist , their souls against the other . <p> The sounds of their fists exchanging could be heard for miles and miles around . Mountains were blown away with each fatal strike and the earth was torn from their immense strength . The duel lasted for one week until the two fell down , weary from the battle . Though tired and wounded , their hearts were still filled with bloodlust . It was then that the school idol made her ultimate sacrifice , and threw herself inside the infernal abyss and locked herself forever in the burning halls of inferno . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of strength bid farewell to the school , and the fair maiden of the east nursing the raging fist of the angry waves ' wounds . The fair maiden of the east heard of the raging fist of the angry waves ' betrayal but she let it go , and held the wounded man in her arms , and loved him nonetheless . As such the fair maiden of the east was named the head of the 2nd council of crescent hill . <p> Invasion Arc A few days passed after the fearsome battle between the raging fist of the angry waves and the pinnacle of strength . The raging fist now turned his attention on the new students . <p> With the influx of new students and incredibly high attendance rate , everything seemed to be in order . That was until he took a look at the students ' performances . With the distressing news of the student body 's general average , the raging fist dedicated himself to teaching each and every student the fine art of combat . He brought the fresh students to numerous battles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ potential magical energy in the environment through manipulation of entropy and magical dynamics using the expansion principle of sub particles ( SP ) . <p> After a week 's worth of grueling training , the raging fist took a look at the student body 's general average only to see no change at all . Weeks past and the students have barely moved 3 levels from where they were during the start of the training . Because of this , the school heard the 1st School wide assembly , where the student body and student council sat in an open forum to discuss the basic guidelines , future rules and regiments all aimed towards the benefit of both the school and the students . <p> The meeting lasted for several days , with the different factions such as the Organization of Casual Envoys , Society of Dedicated Fighters , and the Independent Brigade of Helonia Island taking the reigns of the discussion . Numerous rarely seen officials such as the fierce rifleman from the southeast and the hidden warrior of deadly fang to name a few also attended this assembly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unknown to the assembly , an evil force was already lurking in the shadows . <p> The assembly finally ended with the fair maiden 's silver tongue and guile and the school established the transitory committee , a committee dedicated to helping the school cope with the changes from the establishment of the sacred laws of the 1st assembly . After weeks of the implementation of the sacred laws of the 1st assembly , the raging fist expected a significant improvement to the school 's performance . Shocked was he when he saw the unchanged student body average . <p> Nothing had changed . <p> It was then that the ice princess of the northern cold brought up a grand idea . <p> She proposed the first ever school festival , a contest wherein people would be motivated to work hard for something of value . The raging fist announced the school festival and the student body 's weary and tired faces finally turned to smiles . For the first time in weeks , the student body stopped being lazy and had finally increased their performance . <p> Amidst the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blackness materialized in the skies . A loud booming voice filled the skies , the voice full of malice and evil . " Weak " it called the school and blackness was suddenly sucked from the student body . " I have been observing you with my collective consciousness .... I have attempted to crush your school 's morale with my pure negative thoughts ... But it seems you have fought back with your unity ... Pathetic ... We will crush your puny school with our might " and the blackness vanished . <p> Puzzled as to what happened , the 2nd council of Crescent Hill and the raging fist began to take vigilance . A mysterious force was out there , with bad intentions spewing forth from their defiled bodies . The school , was only able to repel the first of many waves coming . <p> Harem Arc Part 1 Days after the encounter with the black spirit of the void ( name subject to change ) , the school is once again at peace . But with the threat of new powers rising , the school can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gods , news arrived at the school regarding a cursed artifact hidden deep in the Oblitius Woods . Knowing of the perils of journeying to this far off land , the raging fist asked the 2nd council of Crescent Hill to party with him in search for this cursed artifact . However , the fierce rifleman from the southeast and the hidden warrior of deadly fang declined as the former had suffered a serious injury after journeying forth in the lands of the Arcadia and the latter due to a distress call from his destined partner , the water nymph of the endless swamp . And thus , the raging fist set forth with the fair maiden of the east , ice princess of the northern cold , and the glass blades of the endless sky . <p> After days of searching , the group finally found the lost tomb of the cursed overlord . Foolishly , the raging fist took hold of the ancient artifact , an ominous looking katana . As the raging fist 's hand touched the katana , a heavy pressure fell upon the party . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knees as magical energy swirled around him . The voices of those cursed by the blade rang out on the barren wasteland . As fast as it arrived , the heavy pressure resided , and the raging fisT fell face down . <p> The party brought the unconscious envoy to the nearest village in order to heal him . The local healer tried his best , but the curse was far too strong . The blade had become latched on to his arm , and no one could remove it . Days after , the raging fist woke up , and denying his party 's request to stay in bed , the raging fist began training the use of his new acquired weapon . From that day on , he was then called as the lethal blade of the burning soul . <p> However , unknown to anyone , the curse did not only involve the weapon latching itself to one 's arm . A dark and sinister event was about to befall the school . <p> *Other Arcs have been postponed but here 's a preview of the Arrival @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Arrival ArcThe Mighty Wall of the Northern Mountains stumbled on the strange new world .

There is also something just so basic that anyone could tell you that ... the " Mysterious armor Emblem " boxes it says 1 to 10 and i 've opened 1k boxes on OS and i have never ... NEVER see a single 10 at most super rarely a 5 . Is that just a translation error on the OS or is it just impossible to obtain ?

The stuff in eidp chron is ok , you can get at one if you saved your eido chron tokens from rank 1-30 or if you 're still unlucky , you 'll still be able to farm them rather quick because the tokens are really easy to farm .

I ca n't say that 's good or bad , but it is possible to get the recipe if people run the dungeons . <p> Other than that , You can get up to 200gold minimal for running the Lvl70 dungeons for at least 2 hours a day . I 've gotten roughly over 7000+gold the past 2 weeks . All you need is the time to work on whatever you 're aiming for . If all you do is AFK fish ingame , you 're demotivating yourself from even playing this game , not to mention how much longer it 's taking just for you to get partway to your goal . <p> I might just be lucky with the RNG , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I do n't  see it reasonable for people to whine about something , then claim they do n't  run dungeons that much , or use AFK fish as the only method of getting cash . <p> lanaraya <p> 05-19-2015 , 10:55 PM <p> Your post gave me cancer . If everyone had such mentality soon noone would be running any TR/CF dungeon anymore . And good luck finding a recipe then . Afk fishing should never be the main income / requirement to get the only viable gear for current content . <p> Why run those dungeons if you only get gold , but not a recipe out of it ? Why would you get motivated to play a game where you ca n't get a good drop ever ? Everyone who needs those recipes is n't even capable of running TR/CF pt/hell or OW pt/hell with their bad equip unless they got a carry who kills everything before they can hit it . <p> People complain because the rates OBVIOUSLY got nerfed . There is no reason at all to not change them back . Why should newer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as older player ? <p> the main reason for my post is some ppl have luck some not but you still can get what you want see with one char i got nothing for weeks with another char 2 in 1 day <p> edoardus91 <p> 05-20-2015 , 01:52 AM <p> Your post gave me cancer .

( level 70 set ) My friend ( level 70++ ) got kicked from party because he did n't use sniper set and his HP only 60K . I 've tried any treasure charm ( normal - intermediate - advanced ) when killing bosses but no recipe drop ( TR , CF , OW CC , OW DC ) <p> Deuce <p> 05-20-2015 , 02:06 AM <p> You only need to take a look at prices of sniper recipes to see that something might be wrong . Even when the level 70 recipes first came out , they did n't cost this much , since they dropped fairly often . I run TR/CF/CC/DC at least once a day ( party/hell ) with 2 character . Thats 196 runs a week and no recipe .. hell , not even an enchatment card , lol . That may not be a lot compared to some people . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sniper set in 3 days by only running solo modes . I 'd say drop rate got ninja nerfed . <p> Just to correct this before newer players misunderstand .. when Lv 70 first came out they cost ..... <p> http : **25;920;TOOLONG <p> http : **25;947;TOOLONG <p> http : **25;974;TOOLONG <p> http : **25;1001;TOOLONG <p> http : **25;1028;TOOLONG <p> My friend ( level 70++ ) got kicked from party because he did n't use sniper set and his HP only 60K . <p> How did your friend manage to get to Lv 70 + with whatever gears he is wearing ?

The Official Servers are clearly thousands of times more stable then the pServer , as shown by the severe lags , the thousands of times people lose connection . the typical incentives to play on a pServer are : increased exp and drop rates aswell as a more user friendly cash shop . the latter is easily noticable , but the drop rates are still identical to official servers , atleast for 70s gears . <p> i keep my stand , increase the rates . <p> Spctr <p> 05-20-2015 , 06:12 AM <p> first of all , in case you did n't  notice : there are 75s gears now , so 70s is already no longer the highest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year ago , its old , its dated and since then there have been tons of updates . so its not new content at all . <p> and to " This sort of mentality is pure crap .

Majority of my guildmates are getting monarch majority of the time .. if not monarch , those def acc sets . <p> Belias <p> 05-20-2015 , 06:18 AM <p> but the 70 recipes are better than 75 armors ... unless i am mistaken .

Even if this situation was the players ' fault , recipe drop rates should be increased until prices balance out , because as it stands , it 's the new players that suffer the most . They have to spend upwards of 10,000g for recipes that 'll be considered end-game for what , another 2-3 months ? Ironically , it 's cheaper to buy and craft Snipers on Aeria 's servers ( after adjusting inflation ) than on this private server . <p> first of all , in case you did n't  notice : there are 75s gears now , so 70s is already no longer the highest possible gear . 70s recipes were implemented more than 1 year ago , its old , its dated and since then there have been tons of updates . so its not new content at all . Name 1 good DPS on this server that uses a full set of lv75 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " the vast majority of players would n't be using the set .

Putting that aside , it still does n't change the fact that it 's easier to obtain the recipes before .

Either way , Good point . <p> Physis <p> 05-20-2015 , 11:37 AM <p> I agree , nothing should be too easy in this game , but like I said , with effort put into it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . Continuously running dungeons does earn you gold , but it is a bit peculiar for me to run dungeons for 3-4 hours daily ( I do n't have a life right now ) and sometimes more , and the formulas barely drop , and when they do ; hello Monarch ! : rolleyes : <p> Newer players need gold for a lot of things . It 's not like once they get sniper it 's done and diddo . Hooray . I 'm not saying they should get things at a snap either . But at the rate things are going , not only is it uneventful to run the same dungeons for multiple hours on days , weeks and months , but it is not even as rewarding anymore . If I ran dungeons for more than 4 hours a day , I would be more than happy to even get 1 Lvl 70 Mysterious formula , but that has n't happened for a while . How much do snipers sell nowadays ? 1.2k Minimum ? Accessories sell for maybe a minimum of 500g a piece . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subjected to just to get 1 recipe ? <p> For players who ca n't find the time of day to play , they ca n't complain . You are rewarded for the amount of time you put into this , like everything else . <p> And as far as being lazy goes , I think people are actually running dungeons . There 's a not a day where I do n't see guild members or PUGs trying to run dungeons ( CC/DC/TR/CS ) . I 've realized that people are requesting this small adjustment ( OP asked for a ' little bit ' increase in the drop rate ) because it feels like you 're not getting anywhere even after playing for more than 20 hours a week ( 4 times a day on the weekdays ) . <p> If it so happens that we are just unlucky and no such ninja nerf ever took place , and Aura does n't agree with an increase in drop rate then people will just have to suck it up and move on ; unfortunately . ; ) <p> MrMischievous <p> 05-20-2015 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your point of calling that lazy and then you 're going on and assume people do n't run dungeons or farm for gears anymore nor do I know where did you get the information that people nowadays ( at the least , you meant to say majority of them ) just gambling on paragon , ST and AFK fishing . <p> Close enough . Putting that aside , it still does n't change the fact that it 's easier to obtain the recipes before . And it is expected for newer players ( who do n't get served first ) to come and to have at least something to say about this and people do n't normally just slam " lazy " on them for that . Either way , Good point . <p> in all honesty i 'm jealous of u newer players ... i have been on this game off n on for over a year+ now n i 'm some what bored of it ( sorry Aura not ur fault ) ... but i am ... n now i see all these new things coming out from TW , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , easier ways to get LP , better ToE , SoE , not to mention getting better chances to get gold ... back in the day i had to BUY AP ... just to get gold cuz the dungeons did n't give 1gold n 10lp per boss ... it was alot less then that ... so if anything the older players should be the one complaining i think lol <p> Nias <p> 05-20-2015 , 11:53 AM <p> I ca n't comment on TR/CS since I never run those but the rates should probably be increased for Otherworld DC/CC .

Increased drop rate , this is the easiest method . We already have level 60 recipes that do this , why not 70 ? Keep in mind 70 craftables also now have accessories to craft so that 's alot more pieces to collect than 60 gears . <p> 2 . Make them available on DC Encyclopedia . Will probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after at least level 80 gears have arrived . <p> 3 . Lessen DPS - not everyone 's favorite but I think one good reason the shortage of availability is because of crusader class hype that even flocking newbies from OS want to try out and as a result , the demand of more DPS increases in an already DPS metagaming . <p> 4 . Limit laments - yet another reason , this is simply a divergent solution ; if we limit laments to per day , people would turn their attention more for the level 70 dungeons for exp , and consequently , this should increase farmers for the recipes . On the other hand , this causes secret stones to be extremely pricey as well so we basically traded one item shortage for another . <p> FoxyAellin <p> 05-24-2015 , 04:52 PM <p> Hi there ! <p> I droped my first level 70 recipe yesterday . It was the sniper chest . After i spend weeks of effort i have to ask myself " use it or level an other character " . Well . My bard just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can level a bard/tank to level 70 and buy a full set of recipes , with the money made while leveling , in the same timespan it would take to drop a single recipe yourself , let alone a part of the sniper-set . I guess i will let the sniper-recipe root in the bank until i reach level 70 with the bard . Then i will decide wheter to use it for myself or give up on playing dds forever ( or until a new solution comes up ) . <p> Maybe the decrease in drop-rate is a ninja-way to increase the numbers of bards and tanks . : 3 <p> -Linn <p> RazorBlade007 <p> 05-24-2015 , 06:15 PM <p> 2 .

@@23370182 @3370182/ 21183 @qwx221183 <h> How To Star Your Gear <p> As of November 24 , we have received a new update called " Star Ore System . " This update allows you to upgrade your gear for added stats . <p> For Weapons , only the Damage is increased . <p> For Armors , only the HP is increased . <p> Note : Armor does not require base HP to get HP . The increase is labeled in orange . <p> Each Star upgrade is at a fixed amount based on the Weapon/Armor 's level . It does not matter what the Bonus % is . <p> The maximum amount of Stars per gear is 5 ( highlighted in the red box ) and takes a total of 32 gears to max . <p> Using Transfer Scroll will remove the Star if upgraded to a new gear . <p> Example : You have a level 65 Gold +20 5-Star weapon and wish to transfer to a level 70 Orange +0 0-Star weapon . The end result will become a level 70 +20 0-Star weapon . <p> Using a 5-Star Green @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To start the process , you must enter Navea and find Analisa . Talk to her and select " I want to magnitude evolution . " <p> The Weapon/Armor you wish to upgrade will go in the top slot . For my example , it is this 120% Lightning Harp . <p> The fodder will go in the bottom slot . As you can see , nothing matches ( element/weapon percent ) . The requirements are that they must be the same gear and color rank . Note : The fodder will disappear so be careful . <p> Click on the " Evolution " button and it will be upgraded into a One Star gear . <p> As you can see by the image above , all matching Harps have become grayed out . That is because you must also match the Star rank ( as shown below with a new fodder ) . <p> Click on the " Evolution " button and it now it will be upgraded into a Two Star gear . <p> After that , you repeat the steps above by matching the Gear , Color @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

@@23370183 @3370183/ 21183 @qwx221183 <h> Some question about the mechanic of the game . <p> Hi everyone , I have a few stupid question I wan na ask here : <p> 1/ What is the initial delay ( cool down ) between 2 normal attack ? 2/ Is the delay different from each class ? If so , can you show me in detail ? 3/ What is the max cap for normal attack speed ( minimum delay ) ? I ask this because I see the SPD stats end at 50% but there are many buff for it too . 4/ I used to play EVA build and reach max cap of 95% but I feel like it is 5% EVA == " . Why ? Because I tested it on a beautiful day . My level was 60 and I went to Cackatara Forest to test my EVA ( Because I have continuos dead in dungeons by one hit due to " Low DEF + HP " ) . And what I got there ? 5 minutes of combo of hits ( no miss ) . I tested 2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 47/50 no EVA ) - Was I in a really bad luck or the EVA mechanic had a problem ? <p> 4 .

It 's even worse if you do n't have HP/Defense to support yourself if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mobs , you really should n't have any issues but it can still be dangerous . RNG related stuff in this game can be very wonky at times . <p> ? It all comes down to the last person you think of at night . That 's where your heart is ? <p> This game has been built in a way that ( althought not useless ) makes EVA the less essential stats of them all . Because of how the game is balanced , there 's no such thing as a " 100% miss " , which sadly I 've witness in other games and makes them completely unplayable . Of course , evasion is more important in pvp than in pve , but even then its not as crutial if you 're used to other games . <p> 1/ What is the initial delay ( cool down ) between 2 normal attack ? 2/ Is the delay different from each class ? If so , can you show me in detail ? 3/ What is the max cap for normal attack speed ( minimum delay ) ?

I tested 2 times after that and the result was ( 48/50 - 47/50 no EVA ) - Was I in a really bad luck or the EVA mechanic had a problem ? <p> Thanks for helping me <p> Regarding your last question , you will only see the significant of the eva stat when there are a lot of mobs around also eva does not allow you to dodge red lines , you still have to doge them <p> I really appreciate for all of you question &gt;. &lt; They 're all very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I 'm thinking about normal attack strategy . I 'm calculating that if I can be more powerful if I have max atk speed . <p> As it happens , the universal cap for all classes is 0.5sec per AA . This means your stream of auto attacks can go at a maximum speed of 2 per second , but it depends on your class weapon speed what aspd% you need to hit that . <p> 2.6 * ( 1 - x ) = 0.5 2.6 - 2.6x = 0.5 2.6x = 2.1 x = 0.807 <p> We can deduce that axe weapon needs 81% aspd ( rounded from 80.7% for convenience ) to cap at 0.5sec per AA . So if you want to cap your aspd , 81% is the mark you need to hit on ravager . <p> Now , some people will tell you that you do n't need to hit the cap exactly , just get close and call it good . Some people also do n't like to do calculations and testing . You can use whatever aspd% you want to , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way to the cap , especially if you use high GCD skills at all frequently . <p> Ideally , you want to hit the cap to achieve 2 AA per second . The moment you start getting lower Speed is the moment it your AA starts going down in increments . <p> From Desparae <p> It 's a bit of math required but it 's all algebra so should be simple to follow . <p> I understood now Then my dmg for now is 70k , if I use my max DMG skill is aimed shot which cause 140k dmg with 0.9s cd + ? ? ? s for animation if max SPD , then I can do more DMG if I use normal attack with max atk speed @. @ <p> But some how it 's only effect if the target is single and not moving . Sonic Bomb can do better in PVE too . <p> I do n't think it would work on a Gunslinger since that class has naturally low base damage compared to a Grenadier , who can benefit from just using auto-attacks . Even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't be much . The purpose is to jump cast your skills so that AA 's happen between rotations . By jump casting , you 'd potentially be increasing your DPS by 60% ( random number since I ca n't find the original thread that did the calculations ) compared to if you just stood in place and used skills or AA 'd the whole time . <p> As a Gunslinger , you 'd hit way past the 67% Attack Speed needed . By level 70+ , using Sniper Set + Gunslinger buff and you should easily have 50% Speed ( without any stat investment ) . Combined with the ever popular Eidolons Eligos or Yarnaros , you 're at 75% Attack Speed . As long as you 're jump casting , you 're going to be doing better damage output than others who just stand still ( except Warbows . They 're stuck on the ground to charge but they hit like a truck from charging if built right ) . <p> ? It all comes down to the last person you think of at night . That 's where your heart is ?

And his combo skill also , I do n't know is bug or not , but when you mount him , he turn into original form . <p> I think it is a bug , like Aelius . Vayu being in his 3rd form was not something announced in the patch notes , so its possible that Vayu suffered the same fate . <p> Originally Posted by Aura <p> On a side note , I heard issues about evolving Aelius to his third form , and the eidolon not working anymore after this . The problem is related to the fact the 3rd. evolution for Aelius is not actually release yet ( as it have n't been added in the patch notes ) but some of the things we 're working on got leaked to the client . For future references , always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ content related stuff that have n't been announced , be sure to consult a staff member to check if it 's sure to do so . The fix for the eidolon will have to wait until next Wednesday . <p> Maybe , but Aelius was brought up about the same time as well . Point is , that up until now he did n't have 3rd form in this server . Buts that 's just my guess , I am pretty sure he did n't have a 3rd form here until the latest update ( I know since I myself was leveling him lately to lvl 60 for achievements ) . In my opinion until Aura does n't announce so herself here nothing else should count . We get our updates by the order Aura and her team decides and so we should follow their notes and not something we read in other places . <p> On side note , if he disturbs your game-play util he will be fixed I would recommend replacing him by other eidolon for the time being .

But since you 're very patient and nice to me , I 'd give you a discount . You can buy it for 10,000 gold . Sounds fair enough ? " She gave the mount a speculate look . <p> " So 10,000 gold huh ? Let 's see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mount ? " The Housekeeper looks like she wants to see the best of it . <p> " Ah sure . " I handed her the crystal and she resummoned the mount .

However , the pony keeps on standing as if it does n't want to follow orders . The pony just neighed in a lethargic way .

In my last resort , I took out a well polished box and showed it to her . <p> " I still have ... this . " I opened the box , I can say that the expression while I opened the box was rays of light comes out of the box .

I am very frustrated that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money I need . <p> The crowd obviously giving me a weird stare .

I just gave her my pleading eyes trying to convince her , out of pity this time . <p> After a while , she just gave me a soft look and said . <p> " Gee ... Mister , if you just need money , just ask me for it . Here , take my 10 gold . Just stop selling me your stuff anymore . " She sighed . The housekeeper grabbed my hand as she hand down the 10 pieces of gold . She immediately walked away . <p> And the Gigas Key of Gaia was totally ignored . But who cares ?

The ramifications of those involved changes in the long therm are very hard to determine , but they could mess-up greatly the game play and game balance if they are n't thoughtful and exhaustively tested .

Yee who have bound thyself between both Church and Pandemonium . Yee who have pledged undying loyalty . Fight now to fulfill your oaths ! <p> This guide of sorts is far less about gear and far more about how to play a successful necromancer . It will include more thorough skill descriptions along with how best to take advantage of them . It will take a look at the tools unique to the class and find their most effective use . By some " necromancer " has been labeled a more advanced class , and in a few ways it is . It 's important to know how skills actually work and not simply roll your face across the keyboard . This is true for all classes , but more so for necromancer . <p> The Layout- <p> Skill NameElement - Amplifier/Duration - Cool DownEffect Strategy <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secEffect : Reduces damage by 4% . Stacks 3 times . Lasts 10 secondsUse : With the Dark Purple secret stone this is your monster grabbing tool . You can also use it to make particularly difficult fights a bit easier . This is not a priority move as the amplifier is quite low . However , there is a mastery for it which increases the damage for all necromancer skills by 5-9% depending on mastery level . It will not work if the skill outright kills the enemy , but if not , even if you kill the enemy early , it will last for 10 sec . <p> Black Flame RaidFire Amp : 100% CD : 6 secEffect : Straight line aoe . Debuffs with the following : for 20 seconds or the next 10 attacks , whichever comes first , you will deal a fixed amount of bonus damage for each attack . Effected by +% damage against boss/player and +crit damage but not by your damage stat or the enemy 's defense . ( Not sure about damage reduction , but seems likely this could effect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The debuff icon will disappear once it no longer effect the target . However , if using the mastery for it the debuff will stay on the full 20 seconds.Use : This is your first move for single target damage and your filler skill elsewhere . ( Second if you took soul bullet mastery . ) Its amplifier is only 100% , but the effect makes up for that if you have time to lay into a target . Remember to refresh it once it wears off . Build attack speed and jump-cast to activate the debuff faster . <p> Frozen Hell ( Yes , it finally froze over ) Ice Amp : 80% CD : 6 secEffect : 5 meter aoe root.Use : Grab the Indigo secret stone to turn this into a monstrous 10 meter aoe root . Remember to use it correctly with your totems . Freeze foes into snake totem DoT and use sleep to gather foes before freezing . It 's also the best skill to set up for Demon Bats . <p> Bone ShieldAoE buff Duration : 25 sec CD : 40 secEffect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with 20% reduction . Once the bubble receives more damage than it takes , it 's gone , though the buff icon will not disappear . It does not work on auto-attack damage and will negate effects of attacks along with the damage it takes . This includes stuns.Use : It 's not a terribly high amount for a health bubble , but if it were , the ability to block most debuffs would make it ridiculously op . Spam it if the fight is at all difficult . <p> Demon BatsPhysical Amp : 85% CD : 8 secEffect : A channeled ablity made of 4 sections . Each section adds a DoT stackable 4 times . The ability is in a large line , quite a respectable aoe . It 's also flashy as hell , quite literally.Use : This ability roots you to one spot and for the durations prevents jump-casting . Still , it is a rather wide aoe . The DoT helps even the deal out a bit more . Best to save it for large groups and possibly on bosses to keep up the DoT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alone , be sure to freeze before using to keep everything in place . <p> Ghost SummoningDark Amp : 130% 12sec Cooldown Effect : 6 meter target centered aoe with the best damage amplifier necromancer has on a skill . Oh , it also raises your summons ' attack 15% . Use : Spam it . Grab everything that lowers the cool down ( azure ss , envoy , your choice of points in speed ) and spam this thing . It is your meteor . You are simply a tanky wizard with cute summons . <p> Strength of the FiendParty Buff 20meter AOE 4sec Cooldown Increase party members attack and speed , lasts 30 minutes . Note : Currently the buff only shows the damage increase . However , a look at stats shows the speed boost as well.Use : First off , you can chuck your sorc party buff off the skill bars unless another necromancer is using the buff . This thing provides more damage and a speed boost . You can build around the speed boost , giving more room to place stat points elsewhere . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fight beside you in pursuit of the promised payment . What ? Surely you remember what claims they have in your oath ? CD : 60 sec . Does not decrease with speed . Summons 3 of 6 possible companions . Necro main gets added bonuses to their stats/abilities for each companion . The summons will also have 25% of the necro 's health and 5% of his damage . Each summon has 2 skills and an bonus in the envoy . <p> Luluse ( melee ) : ( A consumer grab at all lovers of pokemon and cute things in general ) Main Class Bonus : Increase speed , and increase movement speed +5%Envoy : 20% chance to cast Black Soul Storm , an aoe.Skill 1 : Wind Biting No effectSkill 2 : Shadow Wirlwind Reduce all damage to summoner by 4% . Have to check , but believe this effects only the mob attacked.Use : Move speed and speed stat , this guy is a keeper if going for a speed build . As a bonus , who does n't  like foxes ? <p> Sakar ( melee ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all that metal . ) Main Class Bonus : Increase HPEnvoy : +25% health , +25% damageSkill 1 : Inflamation Wrath Reduces damage by 4% for 10 seconds.Skill 2 : Flames Assault Gap closer ... Use : Not as good as Aaliya , but this is your other survival summon . Should give you a tiny bit more health as well if the spirit bond envoy triggers and you got Laputins minus all stat envoy ( which also boosts Sakars health and damage . ) <p> Death Shadow ( ranged ) : ( A shout out to all the ladies standing up for their rights to cute guys in games . ) Main Class Bonus : deals additional damage . Seems to be a small fixed amount with each of your attacks.Envoy : ( +200% attack speed , +20% crit ) Skill 1 : Cold Style Boosts damage 15% and attack speed 150%Skill 2 : Ice Blasting Shot slows move speed by 20% for 10 secondsUse : This is your damage summon . It boosts your damage and has the best dps among the summons , for what little that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well if you 're sure you can survive . <p> Qwest ( ranged ) : ( We do n't really know what this is ... We think a baby alien may have dropped it out the ship when his family was taking a vacation in pandemonium . ) Main Class Bonus : Increase criticalEnvoy : 20% chance to cast Chain Black Lightning , a skill which bounces off multiple enemies.Skill 1 : Dark Thunder Bolt Crit damage received -6% for 8 seconds.Skill 2 : Abyss Lightning No effect.Use : I do n't  , but I guess if you like the extra crit feel free Ranged is nice for grinding field mobs I guess . <p> There are 3 common subs for a main class necromancer , sorcerer , bard , and tachi . Not that there is anything wrong with wanting to use another sub class , but these 3 tend to be chosen more due to what they have to offer . This section is for those who decided to take the sorcerer sub class , as I did for the game play , class concept , and a certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the necromancer class . Is it the best subclass ? Ehh ... though sorc sub is better than most , for the best damage and survivability you will want to go bard . But if you like having all sorts of tricks up your sleeve , necro/sorc the totem master is your class . Now , I 'll give a brief overview of sorc skills as we 've had the class long enough to figure out what they do . Of course , it 's still important to remember and use all skills appropriately . <p> Sorcerer Skills : <p> Soul Draw- A good leech skill . Unless you gear for it , it 's not for damage , though you could stack dark damage and use the right book to make it decent . <p> Demon Seal- Lowers evade and adds a bit of damage to each attack . May as well use this for longer boss battles as you got 4 summons also getting extra damage . Not a priority move ( unless you really need to cut evade ... ) . <p> Shadow Bolt- Single person root @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making it good for nabbing runners , but you would sacrifice stats by not using a better stone . Nice for those on a budget though . Now , why would you use this over frozen hell ? Well , first you might not want to root an entire crowd and give the whole lot of them immunity . Second , unless you 're using a weaker book for nocturnal this should do more damage . Just make sure your book is dark element and consider the dark damage boost trophy . Third and most importantly , the root is a second longer . <p> Blood Seal- The multiplier is n't too great and the health recovered is n't that great either . I would not advise using this much . Rather situational if used at all . <p> Rejuvenation Mantra- Do not spam this . The most important part of this skill is the debuff cleanse . You may use it if having trouble keeping health up , but do not spam this . Also , if in a party make sure you 're close enough to get everyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around the skill , you may as well not use it . If you want to spam Flame Impact , reroll as a main sorcerer . Honestly , it 's just not worth building up the power of a skill that suffers the penalties of a subclass , especially when you got a skill like ghost summoning in your main class . <p> Nightmare Totem- Do not use this against a single opponent if you have your summons out . It can be useful if your summons are busy elsewhere or running and gathering mobs in a dungeon ( summon after all mobs gathered ) . It also counters gap closers . <p> Ultimates- <p> Black Snake Totem- Effect : Free-form ultimate which creates a totem cutting the move speed of all enemies in the area by 40% . Also has a strong DoT . Use : Loads of fun . The mechanics behind it are also quite ... interesting . For instance , it will attack anything that comes into range of the slow debuff . However , it also can attack enemies further away , though it will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these enemies . Do not use the the Crazed Black Snake Totem mastery . It will give your totem a grand crit damage total of 100% . As it does not require a target to use , you can make use of the iframes to avoid large hits . <p> Hell Butterflies - Effect : Free-form 10 meter aoe ultimate . Places a DoT on enemies . Use : Very pretty . Decent damage . Similar to snake totem , you can use this for the iframes to avoid large hits . <p> Ice Storm- Effect : Aoe knocking back opponents 20 meters . Use : Probably want to avoid getting this one . It forces you to grab at least one demon bat envoy which you should not be using too much . It also is n't quite as helpful as the other 2 . <p> Crazed Soul Bullet-5%/7%/ 9% Effect : Soul Bullet increases the damage of all necromancer skills for 10 seconds . Buff is applied to self . No effect if enemy dies when the skill is used , but buff stays if enemy dies after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than " Terrorizing Black Flame Raid " or not . If they are about equal , this would be the best when going it alone as the other benefits from having people around to proc it . However , I suspect this one is better by a larger margin . <p> Abyss Soul Bullet-100 a tick/110 a tick/120 a tick Effect : Adds a 10 second DoT to Soul Bullet . Use : Do n't . It 's actually not as bad as it looks , but the other masteries are better . <p> Magic Core Bone Shield -+10%/+20%/+30% Effect : Increases the amount of damage absorbed by bone shield . Use : This is your defensive mastery choice . Might be a good idea to pair this with a +5 costume card .

Even if you have Discerning Attack proc , it still would n't be much . The purpose is to jump cast your skills so that AA 's happen between rotations . By jump casting , you 'd potentially be increasing your DPS by 60% ( random number since I ca n't find the original thread that did the calculations ) compared to if you just stood in place and used skills or AA 'd the whole time . <p> As a Gunslinger , you 'd hit way past the 67% Attack Speed needed . By level 70+ , using Sniper Set + Gunslinger buff and you should easily have 50% Speed ( without any stat investment ) .

Bosses drop a fixed amount of loot , which is always 3 items . 4 or 5 if you use charms . <p> Even if it did , it would only help you get a 4th item maybe . I do n't have luck gear so I ca n't test it . <p> It has its own place . If a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 50% , the boss should 've dropped 6 items insteadBut it does not <p> Where is the real function then , you must be thinking by now , fortunately guys from AG tested those and its kinda sad on how much gold he has trashed for this <p> I 've tested this on Fredrick . I 've tested this on ET , I 've tested it on elite mob boxes , even elites themselves . I even got a frost witch hat on a random ET run WITHOUT luck gear , most of my rarest loot comes at RANDOM when I do not have luck gear on . <p> I 've tested full luck gear in closed beta at fairies afking . My inventory filled up faster . I even blew my FTS cards on Mysterious protractors trying to make sigruns belt and iron belt drop from treasure chests . I 've even spam runned GG for that with luck gear . <p> 1000 mob kills without luck you will proc between 250-350 drops 1000 mob kills with luck you will proc ( depending on your luck , let 's say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 700 and with the laws of average you will get between 600-800 items from said mob . <p> In those drops 300 VERSUS 700 how many times do you think something rare will pop up ? Yeah , more drops = more chances of rares , but it does NOT make rares drop at ALL . <p> It does not affect static drops at ALL , that 's purely up to the RNG to determine whether you get crap or awesome stuff . How many times do i have to redundantly state this ? Do people really not have the logic to grasp something so simply put and wish to believe hocus pocus abracadabra black cat and voodoo ? <p> Until you start getting custom costumes dropping every few kills , or even recipes for 60 stuff , gold weapons etc -- oh wait , it does n't happen that often does it ? Yeah . <p> Let 's sum the TL ; DR version of this Lucky Gears does not affect Bosses because its static drop , things you really want -- if you want more , use charms , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to boost static drops , the boss drops Lucky cards 10%/20% does not affect bosses too , it has same effect like lucky gears , as you can see in your statsLucky gears does affect normal mobs drops , so they drop often , and in this server they can drop 2 items at once , so easier farming , but not worthwhile since the lucky cards are attainable only through AP means Its up to RNG whether it want you to have nice things or not Maxed out drop rate are 63% plus guild buff It does not affect box rewards <p> So lucky cores , yes or not ? Both yes and no , the no is : -they cost like hell of a fat boy and what it does is only nuke your golds and time -Imagine you use 7-lucky cores , that could be replaced for 7%damage or 7%crits with 7%of defensive stats , Its hella lot and do n't try this in party/hell/lament mode . -Maxing out lucky set to 70% requires 20% loot drop and it costs real money -Have I mentioned Envoy path @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it only boost 6% <p> The questionable for rich guys out there -If you want to have 2 sets of luckys and usefuls , there 's 7 slot of lucky gears , and 7 slot of useful gears , 14 in total , you need at least 10-bag expansion , its kinda useful but too pricey even for richs standards

While some Private Servers offers their gears via ingame currencies . And donation is just optional . ( You can even get free AP from staying up in 3 hours . ) Most private servers are very flexible and open for improvements . While official servers focuses on their " in house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Servers tend to look for an outsource to fix bugs and what not . <p> Specific : Dungeon Resets here are shorter than the official server . Which mean that you can spam dungeons more . You can spawn 4 eidolons in Temple of Eidolons . Instead of the usual 1 in official server . Loyalty Shop Offers you some juicy promos and stuff . : 3 <p> MikuruX <p> 03-07-2014 , 07:45 AM <p> For a solo player mostly like myself , it 's great to be able to enjoy the game on my own without having to bother looking for help from anyone ( at least where I 'm at right now ) . I have a lot of personal space for myself which I like although I do end up trying to talk to people from time to time as well to break the monotony . This was something I could n't really do in the official server . <p> The rates are good to the point that it does n't make me frustrated at the fact that I will never get good drops .

Thank you for proving me wrong that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whatnot . My bad for judging : c . <p> People do have different opinions and mine is that AK is far from p2w .

I 'm currently at level 49 and only have 25 Gold .. <p> Why do I feel like getting gold here is harder than the official server ? I can farm items but it 's so hard to sell them .. No one is buying them .. if there is someone interested .. the price is very LOW compared to official server .. I played private because of high rates .. I really thought my life would be easier here lol and not to mention the number of players is really low <p> Admin wo n't you mind increasing the gold drop a bit ? I need it for hp potions , foods , etc <p> and also I do n't feel the x2 drop in this server in dungeons and instances .. I run demarch mines 2x and never get even one good item to sell .. <p> Have 42 Weapon Fortification Scrolls and only get weapon to +5 fortification rate same as official too ? <p> I had 100ish gold at that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( And is worth investing ) is fishing . Getting at least 1 gold fish covers the first 50 baits or so , and usually luck just rolls right in from there , especially if you get a diamond fish . <p> I must have wasted 500g on random stuff , and now I sit with 179 gold . <p> I am giving you this idea because I want dev 's to work at the projects without too much delay ( Minus resting and breaks , that 's obviously important ) , and I feel as if the idea is n't good to go for right now . <p> From getting the orange fish of the sea ( To give you a chance for getting one , or maybe platinum or EVEN diamond out of the other stuff ) you are fishing . <p> I can give sources , but I will make one on here that skims stuff that you need and not need in time . But if you are starting out , start fishing for chests ASAP for it 's gear . And then after that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Will be hard , but with practice you can get it ) <p> gold rates are fine u can get double rewards on the chests this works specially well on fishing since the give " weapon " chests with gives 2-4 weapons including fishing gear <p> so go get your fishing gear even on afk more fish for 1-2 hrs you can recover what you spend on lure costs &amp; make a profit without the use of the AH <p> here i 'll give you an example i bought 200 bait with cost me around 3.8g afk fished with beginner gear on cartaka forest the lvl 30 map after 1 &amp; half hr i came back clean my inventory from the " trash " loots sold all the weapons i could get from the boxes &amp; came out with 5g+ including 1 costume .

This only applies to Bard since its a healing class . <p> Usually classes that have P-Healing are the ones that rely on Bard 's support for HP sustain . Although having P-Healing activate in your envoy path or not does n't really make a difference at all . It just allow you to receive more HP recovery .

You could consider using a triple cast drink since the float 's def bonus ( although hp bonus is nice ) on anything below lvl 73 when you have 20k base def ( I do n't know if you have your float out ) because def always caps at 75% , regardless if you have more than double the def required to cap at 75% ( else we would be seeing a bunch of stuff hitting for 0 all the time ) . <p> Thanks for the fantastic guide though . I 'm planning on making a rav/bow sometime so this helps a lot ! <p> I still feel like a noob too .

I know he is showing his level 75 stats on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with gold . My rav is only level 50 but it is a fun class to play and round &amp; round is real nice . Thorn and Heca have awesome guides that are easy to follow . <p> How should I go about putting stats if I am just starting as Ravager ? Like how much in DMG , how much in crit and speed ? <p> I ca n't really tell from your description ( Total noob at this game , just started a week ago ) <p> For leveling purposes , it 's better to go full Famage so you can clear things a bit faster . Investing in Critical/Speed at such a low level tends to slow you down since you wo n't notice a huge difference . <p> I usually do full HP but that 's just my preference . Players with lack of gears are usually told to do full Defense first and then focus on HP after . <p> ? It all comes down to the last person you think of at night . That 's where your heart is ?

I am a self taught artist who never got formal training from anyone , though I have been drawing and making art since I was a kid . I used to be a web designer but the long hours of work required really does n't work for me . I am also a painter , but it 's more of a hobby than a source of income . I am a very big fan of people who can draw well digitally , mainly coz I can only draw and sketch using pens/pencils . <p> I accept requests for signatures and avatars mainly , though from time to time I can sink in a request for an FB cover or banners . I do n't stick to a particular style when making siggies , I just sort of doodle away until I find a nice concept that matches the character I am working on for the signatures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I am a working mom , so there would be times that I ca n't complete requests right away .

I accept non-rendered images but I will immediately inform you if the image you provided is very hard to render . 2 .

Small images and low quality images are hard to work on . 4 . Kindly provide me a short background info on the character/image you sent ( I use this info to match the siggy theme too ) . This is helpful but optional . 5 . Preferred color theme and overall siggy theme is still required ( unless you want me to decide on this for you ) . 6 .

Both of you are going off topic by posting screenshots of your PVP scores and whatnot , you can do so privately or in the correct section . Also please do relax , just because other people are playing a certain class does n't mean they 're copying " your build " or " your class " because from my observations there were many strong grenadiers in the server since the start , for example ZhaoWei I 've seen in the PVP board for a long time , it does n't mean every grenadier after is " copying him " .

This would induce fairness and a sense of goal setting on those players who want these Eidolons .

This would also let players go back to each dungeon in hopes in finding that certain Eidolon . <p> Another suggestion would be putting them in Eidolon Temple/Guild Hall Spawns and such .

But each Eidolon is unique on it 's own way , and there is no possible way for us to code the battle if it does n't exists in the files already . With Endora and Serena there might be an exception ; but its not the case of Tsubaki neither Vermillion ( at least , not for the moment ) . <p> It will be consider , but yet I ca n't assure you it 's possible until a dev. looks upon it .

But with being a city this great , it was bound to hold elusive secrets even within its majestic walls . <p> I saw a figure that I am familiar with . I focused my gaze , only to find that it was Reindhart , the former Templar commander , in fast pace that seems to be heading towards the grand gates of Navea . It was not the warm summer breeze going into my humble cabin that woke me up that day , but the inaudible chatters outside . I was trying to think about what I had just dreamt and wondering the reasons why I often dream about the Templar commander more and more often than usual .

The downside was that she does n't  know who I am . For her I am just another face in the sea of crowd . She started to ask if there was anything that the army wanted ; but I just stood there . I picked up my jaw from the floor , shook my head and run like hell . I once again tried to steal a second look at her only to see a glimpse of smile and quickly turning her head to her next urgent customer . <p> I can feel my hot sweat running down my cheeks as I sprint towards the stairs at the front of the Military Hall . I can already see Andre standing in front of his platoon . You can feel the authoritarian presence from the Templar commander . His lean built and stance displayed no weakness , if it werent for his eyebrows that showed weariness and surprisingly maybe a hint of fear , u might think he could be the perfect soldier . I had only seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Reindhart , Andres predecessor and friend , left and never to return again for the reasons only Reindhart can answer . With his powerful voice that roared around the field of the Military Hall . Andre announced that some of us will be dispatched to Candeo Marsh in order to pursue and defend the city from an upcoming conflict . He have yet to say what it was while Alex and Anya were going to be waiting for us in Candetonn and they were going to brief to us everything that we needed to know once we arrived there . For someone being so meticulous and prepared , it seemed that there was something bothering him that day . I can only guess and speculate what he was thinking since our Templar Commanders mind was wandering off and seemed to be unease . <p> It was an uneventful day as it passed by . I did my regular work in the Military Hall , trained and share thoughts a bit with the other soldiers and knights . Each platoon had been assigned to their proper destinations and will be heading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reminded me that I need to go home and prepare my things for my travel . I head towards the Trade District to meet with Analisa like always do whenever I head home . Analisa was smiling when I was walking towards her . She seemed happy and excited like I have never seen her before . Beside her , was about a foot and half thing wrapped in linen cloth . I asked what it was and she started to unfold the cloth handed it to me . Her expression changed from being excited to being worried . In my surprise , it was a harp . Music was one of the rare things that can calm me like the whole world washes away from me and bringing me to another universe where I feel happy and complete . My music and notes can be as calm as placid water or as savage as the unmerciful waves crashing against the mountain side depending on my mood . The harp was well balanced with my grip ; I was so comfortable holding it that it felt like it was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinking that rare materials were been used to create such alloy to make an outstanding masterpiece , I forgot to ask the reason why she even had this sublime thing . Apparently , she heard about the departure of soldiers and knights tomorrow . It seemed like news travels faster than I can think today . Only few words were exchanged during our conversation but for me it was so meaningful that emotions rushed through me . I headed home thinking that maybe this day was n't that uneventful after all . <p> It was almost noon when we arrived at Candetonn in Candeo Marsh . The scenery was so much different from what I used to from Navea . Unlike Navea , Candeo Marsh was surrounded by these tall trees , plants that were obviously abundant throughout the field and noises from living things- I can only hope- that I had never heard before . This was a new territory for me . And I started to worry not because of my safety but because of the mysterious things around and the events that would be happening after this . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cant put my finger on it yet . The eerie ambiance had made me unsettled and somehow my hands ended up on my back-up . I felt the cold metal of the harp that Analisa gave me and it soothed me a bit , that it helped me fall asleep that night . <p> Being prepared and ready was one of the many things Andre had taught me . I even asked him why he loved the battlefield so much . He only replied that ; if you want peace , you should always be ready for war . I cant help but to stare at the harp Analisa just gave me . As the alloy weapon caught he ray of light coming from the windowsill , it gave me hope that everything will go well in our future endeavors . An hour after breakfast we were called at the meeting hall in order to explain what was actually happening . An elegant yet oddly intimidating knight stood in front of us . She exudes the same confidence and authority that Andre had . With her sure and firm voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watery cave started to come out and were being more aggressive with their actions . They just started to lurk at the outskirts of Candeo but information gathered recently was they were attacking more and more Humans as the time passes by . They seem to think that this new threat will be a problem to safety of the people of Navea . Apparently , we were going to be heading to a place so called- Sarpa Abyss . Even by the sound of its name that it was like place a sane person would not go . I have never seen Sarpas before in real life ; I had only read them in books . Little was to know about them . I read that Sarpas were elusive snake-like creatures who dwell in their caves while avoiding other neighboring races . <p> DashJ <p> 05-02-2014 , 12:27 PM <p> We traveled for hours hoping to get to the Sarpa Lair safely . The massive branches from the tall trees protected us from the heat of the sun . Actually , it was too much cover and protection that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thick roots hindered us a bit but even with all that , clusters of glimmering crystals , chunks of ores , huge variety of wild flowers and a lot more minerals were plentiful in this side of the marsh . I wish Analisa was with me since I know she appreciate these materials than anyone in our platoon . I think no one would have thought that this peculiar marsh holds such rich treasures . As the time passes by , it was starting to get harder and harder to walk . I thought it was only because that we were traveling for hours now but I noticed that the soil became more damp and more of a mud as we pass through . I felt like someone or something was watching us . I try to look around and saw nothing . I saw Alex shifted his body uneasily , he became more vigilant , prepared and it seemed like nothing would get pass his stare . Our feet were becoming heavier as we step into the marsh . The supposed lair of the Sarpa seemed to be deserted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surroundings became quiet , too quiet that even the insect we were hearing before were silent . Alex decided to break the silence and with his deep confident voice , he said that they were going to emerge anytime and we should be prepared for about to happen . Alex was right , the Sarpas started to slither towards us . The three Sarpas that were heading toward us were not in a hurry . It seemed like they were actually waiting for us . Two of the Sarpas were much shorter than the middle one , but they do not fail to be bigger than us . Their violet wet skin was glistening from the moist surrounding inside the cave . Their eyes were as fierce as I recalled from the book I just read . I marveled at the creastures before me . From their fins that served as their hair , their magnificent gold armors that aided them from battles . It was a sight to behold to see such a creature like this . <p> We traveled for hours hoping to get to the Sarpa Lair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us from the heat of the sun .

The Sarpa in the middle , which was obviously higher in position the the other two , tilted its head gently and was staring down on us . The feiry gaze of the creature send a shiver down my spine . Alex was not going anywhere by the way his stood . His unwavering will and bravery was evident on how he never stopped looking at the Sarpas . The voice inside my head was melodic and soothing . Until I finally realized that Sarpa Leader was the one who was talking . <p> " For a long time we 've been oppressed by the humans and can only live in this gloomy cave " <p> But the context of the message did not make any sense to me at all . Oppression and invasion were one of the few words that were ingrained in my head . Are n't  they the ones who were openly attacking humans and being aggressive all of a sudden ? The statement was confusing me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was obvious that they knew about us . The sound coming from the mouth of the Sarpa was like hint of growl and a bit raspy which I was no way near from the sound just heard . I glanced at soliders beside me , it was clear that they were also hearing what they were hearing . <p> " Enough ! Let me show you the power of the Templars ! Everyone , ready to attack ! " <p> The armored knights started to pace forward and then suddenly the ground shook , odd black smoke was between us and the creatures . From it , gargantuan spiders emerged from the earth . The Sarpas obviously prepared for this battle and calculated our moves . Within mere moments , the huge spiders were on a rampage . I managed to repel one of them which leaped towards me . The other soldiers did not have the same luck that I had . Alex killed most of the huge spiders . His anger and wrath was evident from the way he killed his opponents . <p> I had never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew was calm and composed and only acted as necessary . The emotions he was showing was new to me . Blood trickled down his chin . Fortunately , He was not bit by the spider . The blood on his chin was from one of the soldiers that did not make it . The fortunate knights who were still alive were still in the fence . They were poisoned by the spiders . If the lethal bite of their huge fangs wont kill you , it seemed like the venom would . <p> DashJ <p> 05-02-2014 , 12:57 PM <p> We went back to Candetonn , defeated and exhausted . We were lucky enough that Candeo Marsh was abundant with rich wild flowers and herbs that could be used to cure the venom dealt by the huge spiders that day . The brave knights were resting in their rooms trying to regain their strength and would be deported back to Navea for a briefing . I was walking down the stairs when I heard two voices in the front of the Infirmary . They were Alex and Anya . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I took another step , and without skipping a beat . They both looked at me . They were staring at me for a brief moment but it felt like hours from the way that they had gone silent . Anya said that I should help curing the knights instead of just standing where I am . It was not a request , it was an order . I stepped inside the infirmary and saw the unfortunate soldiers that were bit by the spiders . But there were something odd about their expression . The venom was completely washed out from their body but the emotion they were conveying was a bit unsettling to see . It was pain from the injury that was causing such emotion but the shame on what happened that day . The seed of doubt not only snaked into my mind but also to the hearts of every knight in the infirmary . <p> DashJ <p> 05-02-2014 , 01:00 PM <p> Two days had passed since the failure of our mission . Alex and Anya immediately reported to Andre . After they discussed what happened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I did not pass through the trade district this time because I was ashamed to face Aanalisa since we failed our mission . During my way back home , i noticed i stopped at front of the Castle Church , I kept thinking about the two words that I actually understood that I overhead between Anya and Alex , betrayal and church . <p> I kept thinking that we had n't  betrayed the church , we just failed our mission . I knew for fact that Anya has a perfect record on doing her missions but I never knew that she could say those things to Alex . I was about to start to unpack my things inside my cabin while thinking about the things that happened in the past few days when a loud knock caught my attention away from my thoughts . When I opened my door , I was surprised to see Andre . I was afraid that he would scold me since I was at the briefing . He did n't  look angry ; on the contrary , he looked withered and exhausted . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surprised me , it also made me worried <p> " I need your help , We are going to find Reindhart " <p> DashJ <p> 05-11-2014 , 11:41 PM <p> If there is one thing that i believe in , it is " there are no right or wrong choices , just consequences " . The every decision that i made and will be making will affect not just the course of my future but the others as well . 
@@23370250 @3370250/ <p> I wonder if anyone else freeze lags a lot on this game especially when you 're around other players and when you load new areas of the game ( especially going into navea or guild hall ) or just freeze lag a lot in general ? I 've noticed that my hard drive that I have dedicated for the windows paging file is usually running at 100% usage . To confirm this I had opened the Resource Monitor to see what it was doing and game.bin ( which is Aura Kingdom ) is indeed using the paging file . <p> So I ask why does AK rely on it so heavily when the paging file is supposed to be used when i 'm low on RAM ( of which I have 8 gigs of and AK does n't even use 1/4 of it ) .

I just downloaded and logged onto Aeria server just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't delusional or anything and I get a perfect 60 fps and loading screens take like 2 seconds there . However here , I get 10-30 fps constantly due to micro stuttering from the game using my hard drive for RAM instead of my actual RAM . So there 's definitely something wrong with this server 's particular client . And as suspected the paging file is hardly used if ever on the OS <p> In all honesty i think this should be a top priority , and should n't be overlooked . With the way this game handles the paging file it ca n't be too good on the hard drives , I mean the thing is on 100% usage nearly the entire time I 'm online lol <p> Ayasel <p> 01-21-2015 , 04:19 PM <p> So ...

We will crush your puny school with our might " and the blackness vanished . <p> Puzzled as to what happened , the 2nd council of Crescent Hill and the raging fist began to take vigilance . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spewing forth from their defiled bodies . The school , was only able to repel the first of many waves coming . <p> Harem Arc Part 1 Days after the encounter with the black spirit of the void ( name subject to change ) , the school is once again at peace . But with the threat of new powers rising , the school can not remain unvigilant . <p> As if planned by the gods , news arrived at the school regarding a cursed artifact hidden deep in the Oblitius Woods . Knowing of the perils of journeying to this far off land , the raging fist asked the 2nd council of Crescent Hill to party with him in search for this cursed artifact . However , the fierce rifleman from the southeast and the hidden warrior of deadly fang declined as the former had suffered a serious injury after journeying forth in the lands of the Arcadia and the latter due to a distress call from his destined partner , the water nymph of the endless swamp . And thus , the raging fist set forth with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ northern cold , and the glass blades of the endless sky . <p> After days of searching , the group finally found the lost tomb of the cursed overlord . Foolishly , the raging fist took hold of the ancient artifact , an ominous looking katana . As the raging fist 's hand touched the katana , a heavy pressure fell upon the party . The raging fist of the angry waves fell to his knees as magical energy swirled around him . The voices of those cursed by the blade rang out on the barren wasteland . As fast as it arrived , the heavy pressure resided , and the raging fisT fell face down . <p> The party brought the unconscious envoy to the nearest village in order to heal him . The local healer tried his best , but the curse was far too strong . The blade had become latched on to his arm , and no one could remove it . Days after , the raging fist woke up , and denying his party 's request to stay in bed , the raging fist began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that day on , he was then called as the lethal blade of the burning soul . <p> However , unknown to anyone , the curse did not only involve the weapon latching itself to one 's arm . A dark and sinister event was about to befall the school . <p> Spctr <p> 12-25-2014 , 06:47 AM <p> *Other Arcs have been postponed but here 's a preview of the Arrival Arc which took place roughly over a month ago* <p> The Arrival Arc The Mighty Wall of the Northern Mountains stumbled on the strange new world . Somehow it looked exactly like the previous dimension , yet somehow different . Unlike where the Mighty Wall once resided , there were no red haired magically manipulated beings . Beside him , the Elven Trickster of the Wastes and the Young Lady of Immense Beauty were waiting for him . Though the experiment had gone awry , it seems they have discovered a strange new wonderful place . Everything was the same , yet there seemed to be more . Various voices shouting " Free stuff " and selling dragon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three traversed these lands , taking down every detail they could find while the Elven Trickster tried to find a way for them to return . Soon after , more students were accidentally being transported to this dimension . The Elven Trickster finally gave the sad news , there was no way to return . And so the students of 1stHighSchool were now trapped in this new world . And thus MoeMagicHigh was born. * <p> They say there are only two kinds of men in this world , those that talk openly about perverted stuff , and those that hide their perversion . <p> I am the latter part . <p> I am the immortal god of luck and lag , the venerable old pervy cat who 's soul reason for existing is the creation of mankind 's greatest achievement , the creation of a harem that can bring any harem anime/manga/novel to its knees . 2843 <p> Armed with my extensive knowledge of the mundane and the vast pool of collective thoughts from the consciousness of famous actors and actresses in the field of the refined art of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good 8 months that I 've started to be a guild leader from OS until here , ( where majority of the active members followed and joined the guild here making it seem like we did n't  actually move at all ) . Although we merely started around a month go ( as of this post ) here in this server , we are opening our doors to come join the wild conversations and extremely explicit use of double meaning words in our casual everyday talk . <p> Now back to about me . <p> I was once an unnamed figure , lost in the world of Azuria , struggling to raise people 's guilds to become the best , only to have the majority of them fail my expectation . And as such , the concept of MoeMagicHigh ( under the name 1stHighSchool back then ) was born . And since its creation , I am proud to say I regret nothing . <p> This guild has also become the start of my very own harem ( yes , they 're real actual females ) and has grown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their names , i forgot half of them already and only remember them through the nicknames I called them ) . <p> I would love to thank my favorite waifu who let 's me- <p> ( Obscene pictures and content follow here and has been omitted by my conscience ) <p> I need to tell her to slow down . I cant keep up with her these days . <p> So to cut this speech , I would like to thank everyone who took part in this wonderful journey and enticing everyone ( women preferably , below 14 is fine ) to join our grand adventure <p> http : **28;2392;TOOLONG <p> LONG ... <p> Ayasel <p> 12-25-2014 , 09:31 AM <p> Lol 'd ...

A friend of mine added me to MoeMagicHigh . That day I was still not familiar to chat system so maybe I lost lots of Guild chat ( sorry about that ! I did n't mean to ) . I 'm not good at talking so most of the time I just do my stuff and watch the Guild . This is a happy guild . The longer I stay , the more perv @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with it ( I 'm a perv too ... just not speak it out : rolleyes : ) . <p> This guild looks more like a high school than a " normal " guild , there 're perv , hot girls *nosebleed* , the outreach and the silent ones like me . And there is a harem maybe ? ? <p> What I want from a game is to have fun . I think I found it here . The other members answered what they knew when someone asked ; invited to party ; shared things , etc . Days before I wanted to talk to the guild but I did n't know how to make a start : D Many times I was afraid that I might bother them . But in fact they 're very friendly .

For example , framed submatrix theory as an alternative to tiered and adjacent submatrix organization methods , a notation method that works when typed out as opposed to the old Imperial-style diagram notation , purely arcanologistical matrixes that do n't need realspace inputs/outputs , etc . Fun stuff . <p> Spctr <p> 02-11-2015 , 03:09 AM <p> I 'm curious . Is magic engineering like arcane engineering ? If so you might be interested in some of the new stuff I 've been developing .

Arcane engineering controls these flow of energy through the use of matrices to circulate this energy causing a rift in the 3dimensional world , and causing a bisecting line to enter the 2d space caused by the rift . These energies spiral around the 2dimensional line causing a mini black hole similar to the one in the theory of time travel . This enables energy to move from one space to the next in near 0 amount of time , regardless of where it comes from . This energy acquired is then use to " bug " our universe , causing other rifts to appear , making Newton 's Laws ineffective , and then The Law of Dimensional Diffusion takes place . This enables one to be able to perform acts such as scrying , farstrike , etc etc . <p> Magic engineering on the other hand does not require matrices , but codes . Using man 's innate potential to harness the energy ( mana ) around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ magic staffs to a more fundamental and technological level , enabling the old magical instruments of the past to be replaced by normal everyday devices such as cellphones . Magic engineering reduces the time needed to control mana around him , at the cost of reducing the types of spells a magical device has . Think of it as using technology to make fireballs or moving a rock . <p> Spctr <p> 02-13-2015 , 06:01 AM <p> Let 's not forget about another important event this month ! <p> LONG ... <p> Happy Friday the 13th guys ! ! ! <p> LONG ... <p> Sakuro <p> 02-20-2015 , 02:26 AM <p> hey there gin its Sakuro here !

I 'm sure with that unique cut everyone will be trying to look up your skirt , especially when you go on your mount . Ceili : You just brush them off and pretend they are n't  there . If they do catch a glimpse , they usually end up being awestruck and I just move on . Q : Isnt it a bit breezy down there ? Ceili : You get used to it after a while , the skirt area is longer for that reason . Its actually quite comfortable in most places , except for Snowy Berg . Q : So for those who want to have a look at what 's beneath your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ normally ? Ceili : You can find me fishing in Vulture Plateau or in PvP at the allocated times .

Pure pink , huh . Anything special about them ? Ovelia : Thats what you called me here for ? I 'm going to leave now . Q : Just answer a few questions for me . What do your pink panties reveal about you ? Ovelia : The plain light pink reflect my purity . I 've told you enough , have n't I ? Q : You seem to be troubled by this interview , any last words before we send the photos and interview to the publishing office ? Ovelia : I feel so violated .

If anyone else like this Idea.Please support . <p> I 'm being 100% honest I find the spawns pretty frequent in OW dungeons . I have n't run enough of -60 level dungeons to know what the rate is there but in OW dungeons I once had 2 Endora 's in a row and a Serena after then another Endora again . <p> while i would n't mind an increase at all , i think they 're fairly frequent . serena generally spawns about 20% of the time when i run wt and oz with a friend . of course , it depends on how often you run it . i think ive gone maybe 10 or 20 times ? i 'd have to check . you just have to keep trying ! : 0

Stay posted ! <p> To clarify on the pictures of my stats in this guide , they were taken with food/drink buff , my class buff , and my 3-star Yarnaros out . So please take this into consideration , as always , use your buffs to " finish " maxing out the stats ( ie 50% speed/75% def ) . <p> Alright , after working with different subclasses , I think it 's time to try ( again ) and write a comprehensive Ravager guide ! <p> This guide is for a PvE-based Ravager , focusing on Zeal procs/Speed/Crit <p> Nice guide , I will try some items in my personal build spin2win , thx for share : ) <p> KeiSlash <p> 06-17-2014 , 08:10 AM <p> I use Nocturnal core on my pistols <p> I thought you use ST Pistols ? <p> Thorn <p> 06-17-2014 , 10:13 AM <p> I thought you use ST Pistols ? <p> They are from the recipe that drops in ST @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the recipe that drops in ST <p> I meant , how did you put noct core on your ST Pistols o-o I thought nazru is the one that has a built in lifesteal ? : o <p> Myanya <p> 06-17-2014 , 01:02 PM <p> Nazru pistol have a built in lifesteal of 2% . However the ST pistol is arguably better than it since you can put nocturnal in it ( 3% lifesteal ) , this 1% diff is a lot . Also ST pistol grants double damage , which is essential to his build . Nazru pistol gives crit only , which he should have plenty of already . <p> What is that ability , or is it a potion that heals you up when you 're almost dying ? <p> Also can you share a bit about your equipment ? And what to focus on if you 're a new ravager , trying to make your way up . <p> Esper <p> 06-17-2014 , 07:36 PM <p> What is that ability , or is it a potion that heals you up when you 're almost dying ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? And what to focus on if you 're a new ravager , trying to make your way up . You use Nocturnal Cores , which is put into a weapon when you craft them . I do n't know Ravager skills but Round and Round is described as a skill with 1% of damage dealt is recovered as HP . Having those two together almost guarantees enough HP recovered in a huge mob . <p> Thorn gave a rough description of why you would use those gears . For leveling purposes , it does n't matter what gears you use until 60+ because grinding is fast . Just use whatever gear you find from dungeons that provide Damage/Crit/HP . For stats , you 're better off going full Damage/Defense just to get through leveling . Once you reach 65+ and start building similar to Thorn , you can reset your stats around . <p> Naberius <p> 06-17-2014 , 09:08 PM <p> Okay , so I assume that potions are the way to go for surviving the lower dngs for the mean time , until I can afford a Noc @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 09:54 PM <p> Okay , so I assume that potions are the way to go for surviving the lower dngs for the mean time , until I can afford a Noc for a decent weapon .

( Sorry , first time ever playing a melee character ) . <p> Esper <p> 06-17-2014 , 11:19 PM <p> I forgot to mention this . When you get your sub class , you can just visit the weapon NPC and buy a blue weapon and hope it has " 3% damage dealt recovered to HP bonus " on it . It 's helpful since you 'll mostly still be using your main skills so the damage of the weapon wo n't matter much .

You could consider using a triple cast drink since the float 's def bonus ( although hp bonus is nice ) on anything below lvl 73 when you have 20k base def ( I do n't know if you have your float out ) because def always caps at 75% , regardless if you have more than double the def required to cap at 75% ( else we would be seeing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . <p> Thanks for the fantastic guide though .

It 's because multiple hits from RnR triggered zeal-like procs more likely than any other skills . Also , TF lvl 4 makes you can deal bonus damage which the damage is pretty awesome . So , RnR plus TF lvl 4 , will absolutely make all your zeal-like procs active more likely . If you want to test it , try to use RnR with TF lvl 1 then RnR with TF lvl 4 , you 'll notice the difference . <p> FyreFox @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have the nocturnal core on the axe or pistols ? <p> Esper <p> 10-01-2014 , 09:59 PM <p> Would it be better to have the nocturnal core on the axe or pistols ?

A complete Sniper Set practically boosts any class ' Speed to a decent amount without any investment .

Or having an npc to trade one eidolon 's fragments to another one or exp crystals ... <p> I think most people will focus on some eidolon to upgrade than others , it would be nice if we can help each others to get they fragments we want and sell those we do n't need instead of destroying those . <p> PastPain <p> 04-06-2014 , 09:06 PM <p> straight out bad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i expressed just how bad of an idea it is , in my opinion of course . Let me point out a few things . <p> On original server , you got 1 ET run every 6 hours with only a single eidolon . On this server you get ET reset every 3 hours with 4 eidolons . This drastically increases your ability to get fragments . Then you add to it the fact this server allows you to buy fragments with loyalty points and you get even more options . Hell you can buy vayu with loyalty alone in 2 weeks . <p> The main focus and point of this game is to collect eidolons and kick ass through the world according to the storyline . With the server already making that so much easier by offering these new methods it seems ridiculous to think it should become even easier . <p> Ill state again my analogy form earlier for others to see . It 's like you go to shop at a brand name store and the prices are too high so you go to wal-mart instead when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off everything ' card and you hand it back saying " Gim me 75% off " . That is pretty much the same basis as what you are asking for and i feel it would destroy both the game economy and the server itself . <p> Wayne <p> 04-07-2014 , 12:13 AM <p> the game would lose it 's main point if they were tradable. and for large exp crystals ... lol ? you want to see more botters out there ? <p> How so ? Keys are already extremely easy to obtain , sadly they are useless for most people because you get more then what you need , by allowing it to be tradable or " giftable " it would add a new aspect to the game . In one guild hall event I get like 4 full keys and a ton of key fragments . I hate seeing " botters " as an excuse for everything . <p> PastPain <p> 04-07-2014 , 03:36 AM <p> In one guild hall event I get like 4 full keys and a ton of key fragments . <p> i 'd love to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 07:47 AM <p> There is n't a bot for it ...

If I remember correctly , Bosses have 95% Accuracy or something that makes Evasion useless . It 's even worse if you do n't have HP/Defense to support yourself if you get hit . If you max Evasion against normal mobs , you really should n't have any issues but it can still be dangerous . RNG related @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Aura <p> 06-01-2015 , 03:36 PM <p> This game has been built in a way that ( althought not useless ) makes EVA the less essential stats of them all . Because of how the game is balanced , there 's no such thing as a " 100% miss " , which sadly I 've witness in other games and makes them completely unplayable . Of course , evasion is more important in pvp than in pve , but even then its not as crutial if you 're used to other games . <p> 1/ What is the initial delay ( cool down ) between 2 normal attack ? 2/ Is the delay different from each class ? If so , can you show me in detail ? 3/ What is the max cap for normal attack speed ( minimum delay ) ? I ask this because I see the SPD stats end at 50% but there are many buff for it too . 4/ I used to play EVA build and reach max cap of 95% but I feel like it is 5% EVA == " . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . My level was 60 and I went to Cackatara Forest to test my EVA ( Because I have continuos dead in dungeons by one hit due to " Low DEF + HP " ) . And what I got there ? 5 minutes of combo of hits ( no miss ) . I tested 2 times after that and the result was ( 48/50 - 47/50 no EVA ) - Was I in a really bad luck or the EVA mechanic had a problem ? <p> Thanks for helping me <p> Regarding your last question , you will only see the significant of the eva stat when there are a lot of mobs around also eva does not allow you to dodge red lines , you still have to doge them <p> Myanya <p> 06-01-2015 , 05:51 PM <p> Eva is the most helpful stats only if you run stuffs like skandia . Also they are legit useful for speedrunning dungeon ( aka walk directly to boss while incoming horde ) . <p> However high your hp is , some dungeons will punish you for mobbing if your eva @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> I really appreciate for all of you question &gt;. &lt; They 're all very detail and full of enthusiasm : D I 'm currently playing Gunslinger and I 'm thinking about normal attack strategy . I 'm calculating that if I can be more powerful if I have max atk speed . <p> Esper <p> 06-02-2015 , 05:19 PM <p> Ideally , you want to hit the cap to achieve 2 AA per second . The moment you start getting lower Speed is the moment it your AA starts going down in increments . <p> As it happens , the universal cap for all classes is 0.5sec per AA . This means your stream of auto attacks can go at a maximum speed of 2 per second , but it depends on your class weapon speed what aspd% you need to hit that . <p> 2.6 * ( 1 - x ) = 0.5 2.6 - 2.6x = 0.5 2.6x = 2.1 x = 0.807 <p> We can deduce that axe weapon needs 81% aspd ( rounded from 80.7% for convenience ) to cap at 0.5sec per AA . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the mark you need to hit on ravager . <p> Now , some people will tell you that you do n't need to hit the cap exactly , just get close and call it good . Some people also do n't like to do calculations and testing . You can use whatever aspd% you want to , but I 'm going to suggest that you go all the way to the cap , especially if you use high GCD skills at all frequently . <p> If we invert these values to obtain the AA per sec , we can see how drastically this 6% attack speed affected our auto attack stream : <p> 1/.65 = 1.54 AA per sec , whereas 1/.5 = 2 AA per sec It 's a bit of math required but it 's all algebra so should be simple to follow . <p> rbinlost <p> 06-03-2015 , 02:32 AM <p> Ideally , you want to hit the cap to achieve 2 AA per second . The moment you start getting lower Speed is the moment it your AA starts going down in increments . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but it 's all algebra so should be simple to follow . <p> I understood now : cool : Then my dmg for now is 70k , if I use my max DMG skill is aimed shot which cause 140k dmg with 0.9s cd + ? ? ? s for animation if max SPD , then I can do more DMG if I use normal attack with max atk speed @. @ <p> But some how it 's only effect if the target is single and not moving . Sonic Bomb can do better in PVE too . <p> Should I try the atk speed build ? Anyone can Figure it out for me ? : ( <p> Esper <p> 06-03-2015 , 03:48 AM <p> I do n't think it would work on a Gunslinger since that class has naturally low base damage compared to a Grenadier , who can benefit from just using auto-attacks . Even if you have Discerning Attack proc , it still would n't be much . The purpose is to jump cast your skills so that AA 's happen between rotations . By jump casting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( random number since I ca n't find the original thread that did the calculations ) compared to if you just stood in place and used skills or AA 'd the whole time . <p> As a Gunslinger , you 'd hit way past the 67% Attack Speed needed . By level 70+ , using Sniper Set + Gunslinger buff and you should easily have 50% Speed ( without any stat investment ) . Combined with the ever popular Eidolons Eligos or Yarnaros , you 're at 75% Attack Speed . As long as you 're jump casting , you 're going to be doing better damage output than others who just stand still ( except Warbows . They 're stuck on the ground to charge but they hit like a truck from charging if built right ) . <p> rbinlost <p> 06-03-2015 , 08:25 AM <p> I do n't think it would work on a Gunslinger since that class has naturally low base damage compared to a Grenadier , who can benefit from just using auto-attacks .

An example would be when I play Grenadier , which has the skill Plasma Cannon with a super long and slow animation . What I do is Jump &gt; Fire Grenade &gt; AA &gt; Plasma ( animation got canceled ) + AA &gt; AA &gt; Jump &gt; Skill &gt; AA &gt; Plasma ( animation cancelled again ) &gt; and so forth . <p> Since the game registered me as already having released Plasma without the animation , it allows an AA follow it right after and another AA before I land ( or when I do land ) .

SPD - Not much of a help but would help . <p> DEFENSIVE STATS : HP- Have more points here when you get 50% def and after capping 95% EVA . DEF-Get 40-50% or Aim for 75% by fortifying your Armor 's . EVA- Try to cap this at 95% by EVA stones and Devourer Upper Set . <p> EVA - HELPS TANKING NORMAL MOBS .. IT MAKES THEM MISS ALOT .

For health , there is no point in gaining it if he 's getting oneshot left and right . I do n't see that envoy path as being helpful as you suppose it is . Every attack you spend building your chance to crit is an attack you " do n't " crit . If you want a class that does n't need to build crit , go katar . It can get about 50% with zero investment . <p> With health , I think you are rather mistaken . Quite often the best way to give a squishy class a defensive boost is to build up health . If you can last just one more attack you have the chance to kill before killed . With pve it 's even more important . Last just one more attack and you can keep getting healed back to full .

Also , would n't a nocturnal core for the katana work better instead of deadly ? Would that help in keeping you alive ? <p> Great guide ! Could also add a food and Eidolon section ?

Thank you very much . <p> Myanya <p> 04-25-2014 , 02:32 PM <p> I apologize in advance if i 'm a bit critical . Your guide has a lot of errors and bad suggestions . Let me put it in list form : <p> 1 . For 65 weapon the analisa weapon is horrible , you can stick Shocking prefix to it ( chance to stun ) and it still would n't be worth using . The 65 Katana from OW is just way better . <p> 2 . The staff from ST is BAD . That 's why it usually sells low since the one analisa sells is way better . <p> 4 . Using titan top and armor is not good . A better choice would be devourer set which gives you more damage against bosses . That -dmg taken from boss wo n't help your eva build if you get hit by tough bosses anyway , it will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a slow tachi wo n't be able to reposition for proper slashes . <p> 6. -DMG taken wo n't help you at all if your def is not 75% yet . With +9 gears and eva setup and all points to eva your def should be about 40-50% . You will get one hit by most tough bosses . Besides your job is to dps , you wo n't contribute much to the party by being too defensive . Basically only get -dmg taken when you have 75% def already , only then will it be worth it . <p> 7 . I wo n't tell you which one , but there 's a particular envoy you should avoid taking because it is bugged . By bugged i mean it will lower your dps considerably in a ' way ' . Do more research to find out . <p> 8 . Advanced skill iaido slash is useless . Not only that skill has long cooldown , you should n't be using fully charged iaido slash in the first place during combos on most enemies . Other skills will end up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ iaido . Better alternative is the -dmg one , it helps your team ( or you ) survive against hard enemies . <p> 9 . Dmg does not boost your DoT damage iirc . DoT damage only gets boosted by skill level and Crit Damage value . It is the same principle with Ballad . Ballad heals do not get boosted by high damage . <p> 10 . Lastly the worst offender of all , the 32% crit . Do n't expect to dps anything with that amount of crit , in pvp a player which has -25% crit eidolon star buff will nullify your damage completely . You wrote that Tachi has a high dps , but the way you build it does not give it anything but low dps . The 3% crit stack envoy wo n't help at all since it always reset when you finally crit . Meaning you are cycling low dps and higher dps , but overall it will still be low . <p> Basically , pretty much almost everything is not so well-thought . <p> Zylphe <p> 04-25-2014 , 03:17 PM <p> I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea about the other points , but : <p> 9 . Dmg does not boost your DoT damage iirc . DoT damage only gets boosted by skill level and Crit Damage value . It is the same principle with Ballad . Ballad heals do not get boosted by high damage . Actually , DMG added to your stats directly do boost DoT damage . However , any other damage ( e.g. from equips , costumes , etc ) does n't . <p> Myanya <p> 04-25-2014 , 04:13 PM <p> I do n't play Samurai so I do n't have any idea about the other points , but : <p> I did mention having nocturnal core on sub weapon if you have read my guide . <p> 4 . Using titan top and armor is not good . A better choice would be devourer set which gives you more damage against bosses . That -dmg taken from boss wo n't help your eva build if you get hit by tough bosses anyway , it will be 1 hit kill . Core should be Imperial since a slow tachi wo n't be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you cap crt dmg go +2 dmg stones and the -2 dmg taken is kinda my preference .. since capping def would be easy once you go to endgame . <p> 6. -DMG taken wo n't help you at all if your def is not 75% yet . With +9 gears and eva setup and all points to eva your def should be about 40-50% . You will get one hit by most tough bosses . Besides your job is to dps , you wo n't contribute much to the party by being too defensive . Basically only get -dmg taken when you have 75% def already , only then will it be worth it . <p> What would you suggest on this ? <p> 7 . I wo n't tell you which one , but there 's a particular envoy you should avoid taking because it is bugged . By bugged i mean it will lower your dps considerably in a ' way ' . Do more research to find out . May i know the reason why would you not tell me ? <p> 8 . Advanced skill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long cooldown , you should n't be using fully charged iaido slash in the first place during combos on most enemies . Other skills will end up dpsing more than the time it takes to fully charge iaido . Better alternative is the -dmg one , it helps your team ( or you ) survive against hard enemies . <p> Well I like Iado slash 's animation hahaha : ) But what do you suggest ? what skill ? <p> 9 . Dmg does not boost your DoT damage iirc . DoT damage only gets boosted by skill level and Crit Damage value . It is the same principle with Ballad . Ballad heals do not get boosted by high damage . <p> I bet it boost your dot .. try checking on that <p> 10 . Lastly the worst offender of all , the 32% crit . Do n't expect to dps anything with that amount of crit , in pvp a player which has -25% crit eidolon star buff will nullify your damage completely .

@@23370269 @3370269/ 21183 @qwx221183 <p> Solution ? Let the newbies struggle and spend so much time doing those 66 dungeons to get their gear ? ? ? Raise our pride , be stubborn , and not do anything to balance the supply and demand ratio ? ? ? <p> Sorry , but I do n't get your point of calling that lazy and then you 're going on and assume people do n't run dungeons or farm for gears anymore nor do I know where did you get the information that people nowadays ( at the least , you meant to say majority of them ) just gambling on paragon , ST and AFK fishing . <p> Originally Posted by MrMischievous <p> i can understand that a lil bit but one thing u got ta understand 2 is even if we are older players n etc ... most of us grinded the hell out of those maps until we got it ... our mind were n't only thinking oh the drop rate is low i must go get it now before Aura or someone else changes there minds ... we went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n we happen to get it or some bought it from gold they earned by buying n selling items from all the LP they get from those maps n went to gamble on the paragon which gave them gold ... i can say i understand the pov of never having enough gold for urself because of all the demands made just to keep up with the updates of the game n etc but that is the part that keeps this game from getting boring .. at least for me .. i got all my sniper , monarch , new weapons n all upgraded ... n cuz of that i was bored of not having another goal which made grinding dungeons boring ... now with the accessory n trophy been able to be upgraded i can enjoy the game until i get all those +20 that is what its all about ... luck has very lil to do with it imho its just matters how much ur willing to work <p> same concept in real life only diff there u do n't have a weapon u can bash ppl heads in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aside , it still does n't change the fact that it 's easier to obtain the recipes before . And it is expected for newer players ( who do n't get served first ) to come and to have at least something to say about this and people do n't normally just slam " lazy " on them for that . Either way , Good point . <p> I agree , nothing should be too easy in this game , but like I said , with effort put into it , one way or another you should be able to achieve it . Continuously running dungeons does earn you gold , but it is a bit peculiar for me to run dungeons for 3-4 hours daily ( I do n't have a life right now ) and sometimes more , and the formulas barely drop , and when they do ; hello Monarch ! <p> Newer players need gold for a lot of things . It 's not like once they get sniper it 's done and diddo . Hooray . I 'm not saying they should get things at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going , not only is it uneventful to run the same dungeons for multiple hours on days , weeks and months , but it is not even as rewarding anymore . If I ran dungeons for more than 4 hours a day , I would be more than happy to even get 1 Lvl 70 Mysterious formula , but that has n't happened for a while . How much do snipers sell nowadays ? 1.2k Minimum ? Accessories sell for maybe a minimum of 500g a piece . To what extent of a boring grindfest should players be subjected to just to get 1 recipe ? <p> For players who ca n't find the time of day to play , they ca n't complain . You are rewarded for the amount of time you put into this , like everything else . <p> And as far as being lazy goes , I think people are actually running dungeons . There 's a not a day where I do n't see guild members or PUGs trying to run dungeons ( CC/DC/TR/CS ) . I 've realized that people are requesting this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' increase in the drop rate ) because it feels like you 're not getting anywhere even after playing for more than 20 hours a week ( 4 times a day on the weekdays ) . <p> If it so happens that we are just unlucky and no such ninja nerf ever took place , and Aura does n't agree with an increase in drop rate then people will just have to suck it up and move on ; unfortunately . <p> Sorry , but I do n't get your point of calling that lazy and then you 're going on and assume people do n't run dungeons or farm for gears anymore nor do I know where did you get the information that people nowadays ( at the least , you meant to say majority of them ) just gambling on paragon , ST and AFK fishing . <p> Close enough .

@@23370270 @3370270/ 21183 @qwx221183 <h> Path of the Necromancer : Choosing your sub-class <p> First thing first , an Introduction : <p> Greetings , fellow Necromancer . I presume you 're here because you are eager to learn , for whatever reason . <p> In this " guide " I will present before you the mindsets suggested you follow when considering the build of your character . I have noticed there is n't much love for variety in the Necromancer sub-class division . I see it as a shame , since Necromancer has so much to work with . We will review certain mindsets in building a character , as well as possible paths to choose from . I will struggle to keep this practical and to the point , so bear with me here . <p> An Overview of the Necromancer <p> Summoner " Summoners are strong supporters and dexterity based classes . The different summons will enable different combat possibilities and strong combos . " <p> I 'd like to note a few things about the Necromancer class , you may skip onward to the sub-class galore listed below @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jump right in . Before you choose your sub-class , I suggest you consider what the Necromancer has to offer : <p> The Necro 's strong points are its Defense , its AoE , and , believe it or not , its flexibility . Although focused on being a ranged class , it functions perfectly well close range as well , so do not let the ranginess of it limit you in choosing your secondary . You can range it up using your summons as bait , or you can fight alongside them if pleases . <p> One big thing to consider about the Necromancer , it is weak in the heal and stun department . If you 're confident you can avoid red carpets when needed , and make do with potions as well as decent gear , this wo n't be a problem . However , if you get hit a lot , lag , or like being close range , you probably should consider getting a secondary with a heal or two , a DMG to HP leech skill or Ultimate skills for invincibility frames . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Reduces damage by 4% stacking 3 times , Necro has pretty high Def from the get go , and being ranged , taking 12% less damage proves quite useful . <p> Terrorizing Black Flame ( Mastery . CD 3.4s ) - Does 20% more DMG , this skill hits targets for additional DMG , including your Summons . In description it states only up to 10 hits , however as things stand it lasts for the whole 20 secs regardless of hits . <p> Frozen Hell ( CD 3.4s ) - An Immobilize , with AoE properties when mobs are grouped together , great for aggro as well as PvP to keep your Foe out of reach . Lasts for 3 seconds . <p> Before I list various Secondaries I 'd like to just throw this out there - with the right gear , point input , and just your own skill you can pretty much make every sub-class work . Some will be trickier than others , and some may not compliment each other as much , that can not be denied . But , if for say you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sorcerer , then it really does n't matter if everyone else uses sorcerer well . Have fun , and do n't be afraid to mess around , you can start again at 55 anyways . <p> But well , just because there is n't as much risk , does n't mean you cant over think some aspects . The most important thing about your build , is its balance . <p> When you choose your subclass , think of what 's missing . Do you lack a stun ? Need more Damage ? Or perhaps you desperately need some heals . Your Secondary weapon compensates for your Main weaknesses , or enhances their strong points . I present before you pros and cons of the following sub-classes , starting Crowd Favorites : <p> Sorcerer <p> " Few dare to plumb the darker side of magic , but Sorcerers brave its depths with gusto . In the pages of old tomes and grimoires they find runes and sigils that , although forgotten by the world at large , have lost none of their potency . With a host of debilitating spells @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way with words . " <p> With the Sorc as your sub you get ; Three Ultimate skills , and while some may argue that Ultis are n't worth the extra point , they provide you with invincibility frames that in some settings may be the thin line that keep you alive , also they look pretty cool . So with that said - Pros : <p> " Those who wield the tachi have unparalleled Sword skills and observational skills so that they can calmly wait and watch for the enemy 's flaw . It is in that moment , with a single strike that they claim victory . Through clashing blades with opponents , wielders of the Tachi are able to raise their soulblade and then unleash immeasurable power in the midst of battle ; cutting down all obstacles and creating a path to victory . " <p> Tachi is the second sub-class which grants you Ultimate skills . Via Envoy Path , one Ulti , Purgatory Blade requires you use points in Greediness or Exploration passives . It 's to debate whether its worth it . I personally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both are pretty speedy and skills chain easily . Also , an ideal match if you want to cap Evasion. - Pros : <p> Purgatory Blade Essentially a DoT , however with a mastery you can change it to an HP leecher , so you end up having three Heals . <p> - Soul Blade + Soul Storm <p> - Decent party buff <p> - Lotta Evasion <p> Aside that we have the , -Cons : <p> - Squishy <p> - Lower HP <p> Bard <p> " Consummate masters of support , Bards know a song for every situation . Always a hit in parties , their sonic skills are enough to see them through a solo performance . With harp in hand , they can unleash songs to harm , heal , or help , ensuring they 'll always be called on for an encore . " <p> If you hate seeing your life go down , and you do n't like avoiding red carpets , or you just want to be able to heal yourself after a duel , there you have it , Bard sub . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and your heals , also more HP output overall , you might want to stack HP , or Defense . You get no Ultimates , but you have heals and can use the points for passives. - Pros : <p> " The ways of magic are mysterious to many , but Wizards see order amidts the chaos , looking to the forces of nature for their inspiration . Using staves to focus raw mana , they conjure elemental spells that can turn the tides of battle , making them respected and indispensable allies in combat . " <p> With Wizard as Sub you get to use Meteor and Ice Storm which are pretty handy for AoE , You get a Heal / Debuff and a dangerous stun . Wizard is a FULLY ranged class , in order to play a Wizard well you got ta keep as much distant as possible , hence Instant Thunder should only be used as a last resort . If you go Wizard as sub , your Necro is going to be a full time ranged class , and I suggest you gear up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since Necromancer basically starts at level 60 , you 're already at the full party dungeon running stage , picking a sub class because you want a good party buff is not a bad decision , in case you were wondering . <p> - Pros : <p> - AoE <p> - Heal <p> - Stun <p> - Great Party Bonus <p> - Staff Max HP / Speed buffs <p> -Cons : <p> - Squishy <p> - Close range will mark your end <p> - Stun , might mark your end <p> - Slow cooldowns as sub <p> Gunslinger <p> " The quickest draw in the land , Gunslingers pack a punch by peppering foes with magic-laced bullets from their twin pistols . To these hotshots , there 's no such thing as an underhanded move in a fight . To that end , they employ devious traps and special bullets to debilitate enemies before finishing them off . " <p> Much like the Wizard , Gunslinger is mostly a choice for the party buff , also , traps . With Gunslinger you can slow mobs approach towards you , use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , easily . No Ultis , so more points in speed , or anything you lack by putting all Stat points in Speed . - Pros : <p> - Traps <p> - Charm <p> - DoT <p> - Special Bullets <p> - Lots of Speed <p> - Speedy Buff <p> - Cons : <p> - No Heal <p> - No Stun <p> - Relatively low damage <p> - Not much to offer other than Speed and traps , scythe being already sort of speedy though ... <p> Duelist <p> " Speeding like a meteor across the sky , Duelists rush enemies with their razor-sharp dual blades before they have a chance to react . Close-range specialists , these fleet-footed fighters combine acrobatics and a touch of magic to disorient and wear down even the strongest foes . " <p> Not much to say other than Dodge skill , and Evasion , decent defense , and pretty speedy attacks , however close range , all of them . Risking squishy-ness , but still pretty fun to play if you 're geared and buffed up your Def / HP . Party Buff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pros : <p> - Dodge <p> - Single Target DPS <p> - Purple Lightning <p> - Snowflower <p> - Cons ; <p> - No Heal <p> - No Stun <p> - Meh damage <p> - Meh Party Buff <p> Ravager <p> " Each swing of a Ravager 's massive axe delivers a payload of pain , and often collateral damage to any unfortunate enough to be standing too close . With fury burning in their eyes , they will shrug off their own injuries and destroy anything that stands in their way . " <p> Ravager is a heady combination of Ranged and Close-Range , quite like the Necromancer . It offers high DoTs , Stun , HP party buff and spin to win tactics . - Pros : <p> - Two Ranged attacks <p> - Stun <p> - High damage <p> - AoE , wreak havoc everywhere you go <p> - HP buff <p> - Nice Stat boosts <p> - Spinnity Spin <p> - Cons : <p> - No Heal <p> - Cooldowns can get a bit slow if you do n't work on that speed , but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Finally , my personal favorite <p> Grenadier <p> " Grenadiers are known far and wide for the massive cannons they bring into battle . These miraculous feats of engineering are capable of firing missiles , discharging powerful plasma bursts , or launching elementally-charged grenades . With such an arsenal , Grenadiers have a blast demolishing foes from afar . " <p> Oh , Grenadier , where do I begin ? Grenadier is basically an offensive support class , it has some more HP than most classes , and two stuns , one of which is a Mastery convertible and an AoE stun , making it comfy to aggro . Along with that , you have a freeze . You get to choose from a list of varied turrets , which also works as bait , comes in handy at tight spots . And an HP as well as Debuffing Crystal , you can either drop it while you 're fighting , or if you do n't mind taking in the dungeons scenery , just let the crystal heal you over time . Grenadier is a fully ranged class , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ main is very slow , not to mention as sub-class . So either cap that speed , or its a no go . <p> - Pros : <p> - Stun + AoE Stun <p> - Icy Grenade ( Immobilize + DPS ) <p> - turret + crystals <p> - High HP <p> - Cons : <p> - Slow cooldown <p> - Slow movement <p> - No significant buffs for its damage <p> Stats &amp; Envoy Path <p> When choosing how to allocate your points , you got ta think back to balance . I 'll present Necromancer Grenadier to you as an Example , however there are two general options in your build balancing . <p> What you want to do is , either put in Envoy Path what you did n't put in your stats , so they complete each other . Such as , putting your stat points in speed until 50% and your Envoy path points in crit , or on the defensive scale , putting your stat points in DEF , and Envoy path in HP . The Necromancer Envoy Path is pretty much laid out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the easy task to allocate your points . <p> On another note , you can choose to commit to one stat in each scale , Offense and Defense , meaning you put your all , Stat points and Envoy points into capping one specific stat , same with foods and armor , once its capped you may move onto leftovers . <p> This is a basic layout to passives you might consider taking . On the bottom end , HP is right next to DMG and DEF , along with Black Raid flame cooldown reduce and these passives : <p> Possession <p> " They are obedient and quite well-behaved , the biggest advantage is that they never have rest . " ? + 4% HP Increase ? Reduce Damage Taken by 5% <p> Soul Binding <p> " Generate links between you and your Spirits , when you encounter danger the Summons will be devoted to your magic and make you gain Eternal Life . " ? If attacked while HP is less than 30% , your Spirit will lose 80% of it 's own HP but you will recover Health @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Blood Ritual <p> " The So-called Promise , which is Infinite , endless , like my soul Calibur , beheaded in the world capable of all evil , spared . " ? When attacking , 50% chance to decrease all stats of target 's by 2% , can be stacked 5 times , lasts 10 seconds . <p> Gearing up may seem like " no big deal " , especially when everything up until now was so easy . However , you 'd be surprised how much gear really makes a difference , From getting one shot , you can start taking two or three hits , even more as you enhance your equipment , but let 's not push it for now . <p> Wearing appropriate gear is pretty important when running level 60+ party dungeons to advance yourself . It may seem unaffordable , or a pain in the neck to assemble , however getting your gear can be " two bird in one stone " I 'll list several options in scoring some gear : <p> 1 ) Farm them , you can drop the Unidentified @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Solo and Solo challenge , and while you 're at it , you 'll be getting Gold , Loyalty Points , Exp and items . <p> 2 ) Buy them , you can buy the specific recipes you need from players on Trade chat , or on the Auction House . The prices may vary depending on the seller , but usually they go for around 10 - 20G . <p> 3 ) Recipes , get them on Friday . Usually after all the big raids finish their Sky Towers , you 'll find players distributing things they dropped , among them , your recipes . <p> So now that we 've got through how to get them , its time to decide which one to choose . As I 've been repeating all this while , B-A-L-A-N-C-E . You want to choose the Armor set with buffs that suit your build . Either to enhance your current Stats , or compensate for the lack of them . Let 's take a look at the equipment available , Shall we ? <p> Since our Necromancers already start at level 60 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to review the level 50 and 40 crafted armor sets , we 've had time for that before Necro era . <p> Titan Set <p> Titan Warrior Headgear " A blessed heavy helmet ; only the most heroic of warriors can wear it . " <p> Titan Warrior Battle Coat " Emblazoned with meticulous patterns that symbolize the War God , only the most heroic of warriors may don this armor . " <p> With these two pieces , you have completed a bonus set : <p> Titan Warrior Waist Armor " Composed of solid metal plates , the ominous clanking this belt makes , calls upon the powers of the War God . " <p> Titan Warrior Gauntlets " These thick , solid Gauntlets can fend off attacks like a shield . Only a select group of skilled warriors can wear them . " <p> Hood of the Devourer " This hood has been woven with threads formed from the Spirits of soul-devouring demons . The way it shifts in the wind gives the impression that a dark force resides within . " <p> Coat of the Devourer " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Imbued to the wearer to emit an aura to frighten away foes . " <p> Top Bonus Set : <p> Sash of the Devourer " Made from the skin of a soul-devouring demon , This dark-toned belt absorbs the strength of the dead . <p> Wrist Wraps of the Devourer " Upon the back of these Wrist Wraps lies a hook-shaped claw , Taken from the hand of a soul-devouring demon . It is said , that this claws can rip a soul right out of its body . " <p> Boots of the Devourer " Once worn to crush the bones of a defeated soul-devouring demon . These boots no send out muffled cries when foes approach , Filling them with Confusion and Despair . " <p> Bottom Bonus Set : <p> Devourer Set is the cheapest and the less suggested to go with . Mainly focuses on Evasion , would complement Tachi / Duelist since they have higher Evasion at base level than the other classes . <p> Now that we 've reviewed every level 60 set , let 's move onto weapons : <p> Scythe of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> This Scythe is courtsey of Analisa , its recipe can be purchased from her for 120g . Adding you extra HP to aid survive-ability , along with 10% DMG against bosses , to help you in your dungeons and an 8% chance to trigger additional DMG . The Magical Winged Scythe may be cheaper , but buff-wise you 'd be paying for quality . <p> Magical Winged Scythe " With a sharp tin-evil , evil will be the holder into the dream ... " <p> You may craft this Scythe by using the recipe dropped in ST / Bought from players . This Scythe excels in Speed , and Crit . Whether hitting harder each time in face of hitting harder occasionally is up to your preference , and pocket . <p> And to the third weapon on our list , which I recommend fully : <p> Zaahir 's Endless Anger Scythe " Fierce anger of fireworks can be burned like a barrier in front of all things . " <p> Zaahir 's crafted weapons , all of them give you 8% additional HP . I suggest , given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ main , and one for your sub . 30% CRIT DMG to Black Flame Raid . An 8% chance to deal moar DMG , and restoring 30% of DMG dealt as HP . Also it 's a flaming weapon . Seems like a pretty sweet deal to me . <p> Before I start , I 'm going to say this . I know that everyone has their own view point and play style . I 'm posting this because I feel like some of the things mentioned should n't necessarily be listed or is missing ( or something ; ca n't really think of the proper way to say it right now ) . <p> Originally Posted by Matya <p> I have noticed there is n't much love for variety in the Necromancer sub-class division . I see it as a shame , since Necromancer has so much to work with . <p> There is n't much variety because the three main sub-classes provide the biggest potential on Necromancer . Anything else and it 's pretty much down the drain . : x <p> Originally Posted by Matya <p> One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weak in the heal and stun department . <p> Nearly every class is weak in heal . That 's the purpose of using a Nocturnal Sub Weapon , bringing a Bard , or being Bard Sub . <p> Necromancer may not have a stun but they have immobilize ( Frozen Hell ) , which works just as good if we 're talking about clearing mobs . Having 30% Speed already makes Frozen Hell 's CD 4.5 seconds . Combined with +5 range SS and you 're set to stop huge mobs . Against Bosses , that does n't matter because they gain 30 second immunity after being debuffed by it . <p> Originally Posted by Matya <p> Next point for thought , Speed .

If a player has gotten to the point of relying on their sub more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It also does n't help that Sub 's have 3 times longer CD . <p> Originally Posted by Matya <p> Books often give extra evasion , useless if you are n't gon na cap it . <p> Uh what ? The books that we would/should use as Sub gives Crit DMG , not Evasion . <p> Originally Posted by Matya <p> Move speed +5% Party Buff <p> It 's +10% Movement Speed , not +5% . <p> You forgot to mention that Bard 's Class Mechanic gives +12% DMG when fully buffed with Ballad .

The purpose of a range class is to stay out of close situations around the Boss ( or whatever your fighting ) . If anything , it makes it easier to avoid because you tend to be moving around . If a range player ( not counting WB ) is just standing still and casting skills , you pretty much know they are n't fully utilizing their damage output . <p> Originally Posted by Matya <p> Much like the Wizard , Gunslinger is mostly a choice for the party buff , also , traps . <p> Necromancer already has an Attack/Speed buff , which seems better to use in a party . <p> Originally Posted by Matya <p> Ravager is a heady combination of Ranged and Close- Range , quite like the Necromancer . It offers high DoTs , Stun , HP party buff and spin to win tactics . <p> I do n't see that many Ravagers using their HP buff . Majority tend to use their Sub buff unless there 's a main in the party . <p> Originally Posted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ begin ?

Grenadier is a fully ranged class , still you have the AoE stun for luring . Grenadier is naturally very slow , not to mention as sub-class . So either cap that speed , or its a no go . <p> I only see one mastery stun , which is Meteor Cannon .

Anything else and it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if we all gon na stick to the classic , then there is n't really any room for building your own diverse build , and on that note , there would be no need for guides , since everyone will just play the same old thing .

It also does n't help that Sub 's have 3 times longer CD . <p> As I said , that 's one mindset you can go with , but take Bard Sorc for example , while Bard can heal and has high HP and DEF , its damage output is very , very poor . So you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You may argue that Bard serves as full support and has no need to damage , but truthfully , you probably are n't going to run in parties each and every single time .

Having 30% Speed already makes Frozen Hell 's CD 4.5 seconds . Combined with +5 range SS and you 're set to stop huge mobs . Against Bosses , that does n't matter because they gain 30 second immunity after being debuffed by it . <p> You 've got to consider that not everyone can afford a Nocturnal weapon , in the majority of players do not use Nocturnal weapons for whatever reason .

How exactly are you going to have a hard time ? The purpose of a range class is to stay out of close situations around the Boss ( or whatever your fighting ) . If anything , it makes it easier to avoid because you tend to be moving around . If a range player ( not counting WB ) is just standing still and casting skills , you pretty much know they are n't fully utilizing their damage output . <p> Try playing a Necro Wizard with the quest earned gear , seriously squishy . <p> Originally Posted by Esper <p> I only see one mastery stun , which is Meteor Cannon .

@@23370273 @3370273/ <p> Hi there ! I guess everybody had the time he accidently tossed a needed item away while disposing grey items or just selling fish . As far as i know i never dropped a item i could n't regain in a few hours of time . There was one key of gaja one time bit honestly i do n't  even remember anymore which eidolon it belonged to . To get it to the point : <p> There is no good in important items being desposeable just like any other . The game-developers decided themself Beebis1 is to important for new players to be lost my accident . You simply cant get rid of him until he gets upgraded in naveas quest-arch . <p> Being unable to dispose some items can be a huge turndown too . The game is progressing/developing , meaning items once important get " meh .. " . This does n't  count for most of the pets , though . <p> My idea is : Render the most important items undisposeable . Golden Forti , Advanced Forti , Rare Key of Gaja ( Created by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ archelogical items , exp-books etc . I guess every player has his own prioritys on this setup but one is sure : You do n't  want to accidently drop the first four mentioned . There is a simple solution to this : Render them undisposeable by any means , just like Beebis1 . Give them the item-price of 1 **26;3032;TOOLONG . That shop is the one most seldom used for selling crap . This way , the " protect my treasures " -idea can be implemted without a single change in the npc themself . You do n't  need to make a new currency , you do n't  have to waste players inventory by making those items Bebbis1-Like and you do n't  have to spawn a new garbagebag-npc . <p> Other than " Players should just pay attention " and " Thats work ... " i do n't  see anything speaking against this idea . Speaking for this idea , you will find several threads in this forums claiming to have lost their good items by a server-bug etc . I guess most of those bugs would n't happen anymore . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ People losing the items by ' server bug ' are mostly due to crashes , not accidental throws . I 'm whatever about the idea , but I 'd rather have things be disposable . I often just throw them away during dungeons . <p> Sky <p> 09-26-2015 , 08:35 AM <p> As Sera said , most people losing items atm are due to lag or crashes . <p> i 'd say it is also carelessness . there 's even a box that pops up stating the name of the item you want to throw away asking if you want to " OK " it or " Cancel " . i always double check that window whenever i decide to throw something away . it pops up for a reason : p <p> it 's not that bad of an idea ? but it 's not necessary when the root of the problem stems mostly from either : server lag or not paying attention . <p> FoxyAellin <p> 09-26-2015 , 08:40 AM <p> Well . I too tend to toss away random stuff when i am in dungeons . Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same . <p> I never wished for this to go for all items , just for those mentioned . I do n't  really think anybody would just toss away jill and snowchild for those two extra-slots of trash-loot . And yes , you can still get rid of those , using the Couple-Systems trader . <p> Sky <p> 09-26-2015 , 08:46 AM <p> what i 'm trying to say is that when you throw away something , there is a chance to cancel that decision . it really does come down to whether or not the person throwing away xx item is paying attention or not . <p> i am curious , do you know how the coding works in this game ? because i have no idea how it works so i ca n't say whether this would be easy or not to do . the way that you explain it makes it sound easy but are you 100% sure that 's how it 's done ? if it is then excuse me for doubting/questioning but , as you know , it 's up to aura to decide whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see which items should be deemed non-disposable and change them . <p> Spctr <p> 09-26-2015 , 08:49 AM <p> In case you guys forget , there 's a future tw update that has an item lock feature <p> Sky <p> 09-26-2015 , 08:52 AM <p> In case you guys forget , there 's a future tw update that has an item lock feature <p> i have n't looked into tw content so i did n't know , no. if so then this thread should be closed since it will happen eventually . thanks for the info ' v ' <p> item lock sounds much simpler than this suggestion <p> Ayako <p> 09-26-2015 , 08:53 AM <p> I think there is some sort of inventory lock system coming anyways ? http : **25;3060;TOOLONG <p> FoxyAellin <p> 09-26-2015 , 09:29 AM <p> do n't  mind my rambling then . <p> at shy : i do n't  know how aura works , that 's for sure , but its common to have all items in a datasheet in which such changes are made by adding a " x " or " y " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smaller game-servers were those attribute-based datasheets were common practics to work with , knowing new items were created by ourself rather than taken from other existing servers .. i am sure aura kingdom did n't  try to invent a new wheel or something . Changing items or creating new ones ( using existing effects . scripts etc ) is a work of minutes and easily neglaceable compared to other tasks managing a gameserver and -community brings with it . <p> Sorry for cutting my answer like this .

You need lps and stuffs to get fortification scrolls to fort pvp eqs to +20 , so i suggest you to get everything . But prioritize pve equip first since it is your lifeline in farming the all-too-important lps . After you got your pve setup done , then you can start branching to pvp . <p> That makes a lot of sense actually . Thank you very much . I 'll focus on PVE gears first . Is it smart then to just save all LPs I get right now until I 'm 65-70 to get fortify scrolls for gear I 'll actually be wearing a long time ? Cuz right now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 64 wearing full battlefield pvp set and it seems like all I did is waste fortifying scrolls on it lol <p> That makes a lot of sense actually . Thank you very much . I 'll focus on PVE gears first . Is it smart then to just save all LPs I get right now until I 'm 65-70 to get fortify scrolls for gear I 'll actually be wearing a long time ? Cuz right now I 've only been playing a few days I 'm 64 wearing full battlefield pvp set and it seems like all I did is waste fortifying scrolls on it lol <p> If you exchanged for the level 60 PVP set , you pretty much wasted a lot of coins . That set sucks compared to the 70 PVP set . You should always focus on PVE first because that is going to be your main source of LP , Gold , etc . <p> ? It all comes down to the last person you think of at night . That 's where your heart is ?

You can still get a destroyer core on your offhand . Eva core is n't that awful . You 'd only be missing out on 15% cdmg or 2% dmg ( I 'm not entirely sure if that 's 2% detailed dmg or not , if not then it 's even less of a loss ) , both if which you do n't need assuming you capped cdmg for bossing . And I agree with what Dawn said , I do n't see a use for crit+ tool . When you have a lot of crit , any additional points invested into crit will become less impactful . Not to mention Duelist has like the 2nd lowest base dmg on their weapon . So any corner you can cut for more dmg is completely worth it . <p> Myanya <p> 09-11-2015 , 02:46 AM <p> Just use that 130% , just make sure your sub uses your desired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people usually do n't use so it stacks on the bosses ( protector etc ) . <p> @Tojo : I think Barbed ( 2% dmg ) is normal damage . <p> Roltair <p> 09-11-2015 , 03:01 AM <p> Ended up going 130% with destroyer on sub .

Thanks everyone . <p> AGray <p> 09-11-2015 , 03:49 AM <p> Just use that 130% , just make sure your sub uses your desired core . Or if you want go with cores that people usually do n't use so it stacks on the bosses ( protector etc ) .

Not a tech expert but I found some suggestions that players did . Go with the Firewall first before tinkering with files . Also make sure to make a copy of the files that you change and place them somewhere for safety . If these do n't work , then you will have to wait for Ayasel or Saito to come online . <p> First , make sure you 've added Launcher and Launcher to the exception list of your firewall so it can go through the firewall. version.txt is the first file it attempt to download @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ due to the fact that the internet was blocked by the firewall . <p> If that does n't work or does not apply to you , make sure your Antivirus/Firewall allows ' Launcher.exe ' and ' Launcher.exe ' . <p> If that does n't work or does not apply to you , like Heartless.Soul said , visit your installation directory ( usually C : AeriaGamesAuraKingdom ) and open the LauncherMod.ini file . However , the default value for ConnectMode is already to 3 , so change that to 1 . <p> The OPTTIMEOUT value should also be defaulted at 1200 , but does n't relate to your problem since you ca n't even get a connection to the server in the first place . Change that value to a higher one ( &gt; 3000 ) if you were launcher crashes when trying to download a file . <p> Different suggestion . <p> try deleting UpgradeErrorReport.txt at game directory , seems to work <p> Ayasel <p> 06-11-2014 , 06:57 AM <p> I just tried that , thinking it would help and then this happened . http : **29;4053;TOOLONG <p> It then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pop up and starts it all over . <p> what .....

Also windows 7 is old crappy and buggy you might wan na upgrade to Windows 8 or 10 . Not all technical problems are software related you might wan na check your hardware especially ram . Also check if your ISP is capping you . Defragging your HDD is also recommended . Your firewall configuration might also be the problem . Google if you want detailed troubleshooting with screen shots . <p> GekkouNoNetsu <p> 12-07-2014 , 03:39 AM <p> Gekkou , for your problem , I suggest that before clicking " Start Game " you should go in options and see if you can find something related to full screen , maybe it 's disabled . <p> Thank you for suggesting that !

@@23370285 @3370285/ <p> Since i 'm on this server , i guess i have been spending more time digging in the dirt than grinding dungeons . I 'm pretty used to the mechanics of the Archeology-System used in Aura Kingdom becouse of that . Well . It did n't  take me long to get the " color-code " which is used/changed with every day/spot : <p> Now , with each day and spot , two changes are made : Distributing Top-Quality , Well-Preserved and Slightly Damaged Artefacts to one color each ; Setting the spawn-chance of said colors . <p> This means basically Blue could have red drops and appear very often while it could have white drops on other days , which is quite fun as you always search for the best colors to go for . <p> However , going for Blue is never going to be worth the time/money . Even if blue got the red-rarity artefact applied to , said artefact appears very seldom , resulting in a overall drop of Archelogical Tokens ( Archelogy Currency ) per dig . Example : Today , Emerald March Archelogy features red-rarity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ red has white-rarity artefacts . In a test , i couldnt get a better chance than 1 artefact on 30 tries ( 2 map pieces ) , meaning the chance of getting " Wisdom of the Ancients " is that high , i would be even better going for red spawns : <p> Blue gives the lowest rate of tokens no matter which artefacts it drops . <p> Looking at it using treasure map pieces : With good luck , you would be able to get 10 pieces of treasure map fragments , which you could then exchange for a total of 4 treasure maps ( of 2 random areas ) Going for red or yellow , i could use the additional tokens to actually buy treasure maps of my own choice ( p. example catacara forest , which drops bard masterys ) , meaning i would end up with even more treasuremaps if i do n't  dig up blue spawns . <p> What do we need " wisdom of the ancients " for ? Wisdom of the ancients can be used for purchising green mounts ( +60% movementspeed ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he gets them . Demir , a 90% mount is given away for free . There are other mounts that cost less than 100 gold in the auction house , meaning everybody will be able to buy them pretty fast . <p> Looking at all of this , i conclude blue spawns are unbalanced and should be worked on . There are easy and more difficult ways to actually do this : <p> - Remove blue spawns . Kill them . Hang them . Put them on the stakes ! - Change " wisdom of the ancients " dragonpoints to about 100 , giving players a other way of filling their bar . - Decrease rate of " wisdom of the ancients " by at least 20% , allowing more treasure map pieces and artefacts to be dropped . - Change " wisdom of the ancients " to a currency used to buy archeology-themed/based stuff . - Change " wisdom of the ancients " to a bag that contains dragonpoints and has a small chance of dropping other items such as " crest of flame " - Change Identification-Tool to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the players being able to go for whatever they want . <p> I hope you will look into this matter , <p> with best regards <p> Aellin P. <p> edit : 09.10. 11:10 - Added Possible Solution " Change Id.Tool " <p> Dawn1123 <p> 09-10-2015 , 10:40 AM <p> You could just level your archaeology up instead . <p> I 'm level 8 arch and do n't get as many wisdoms compared to other items from blue , blue also gives the most xp out of all as well which is nice . As a perspective , doing 100 normal digs not caring about which colour , I get around 17 map pieces , and 25 wisdoms . <p> I do n't mean to be cruel , just honest , so everything you 've suggested is either a ) a waste of time because only a small minority cares about archaeology and some would require significant changes , b ) not necessary because once you level archaeology that kind of thing stops happening , or c ) completely and utterly unbalanced . <p> I 'm level 6 . Well . To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most exp to the refining-level . Will test that . On the other hand , as i want to believe you , the level 7 buff seems to increase the amount of treasure-maps times 10 . I hope so . <p> eureckou <p> 09-10-2015 , 01:09 PM <p> I think in addition , it would be better if the " relic " drop would also include a rare lv.75 gold accessory/trophy . When you hit Lv. 70 , archeology is relatively useless . Unlike when i was still at Lv60-Lv65 , I do it daily just to get the otto armor and galen helm . Now i only do it for achievement and eidolon prayer .. which is not so exciting at all . <p> FoxyAellin <p> 09-10-2015 , 01:21 PM <p> Tested this at three spots now : Port Skandia , Rainmist Reach , Wild Wind Valley The exp is n't set to a specific color , but to the drop instead :

Hundreds of runs meant to farm recipes ended up getting unwanted stuff ( mats ) and the annoyance getting rid of them . Double disappointments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by materials you mean crafting materials ? you can sell it to other players or do the daily quest in navea for loyalty <p> That 's precisely the point , everyone drops so many mats ( in this case i think mostly 70 mats are meant ) that nobody buys them anymore . and the daily quest is for levels 40,50 and 60 so you ca n't use 70 mats for them . Even if there was a daily quest for 70 mats , if you do 1-2 full runs every day you loot 3-4 stacks of fire meteorite ore and shit-loads of the other mats too . <p> I 've read somewhere that there will be a future " Auto Drop " feature ( Correct me if I 'm wrong ) which automatically discards those types of items . Or was it an " Drop Item based on category " I forgot the exact term . <p> This forces people to make alloys out of these mats , which in turn drains gold from the server .

Rewards are sent out every 14 days ( when majority of promotions are 1 week ) , Ranks 1-3 get Stat bonus , Top 10 get 2k LP . <p> Second option is the same as first option . Impossible to do for time limited Promotions . <p> Third option is if you 're really desperate . <p> They 're okay options for the long run but not short run . Either way , you 'll easily cap LP just by doing what was listed above from casual playing . <p> And why the 10th day log-in pack does n't give 1000LP like the original ? <p> Nessvil <p> 07-11-2014 , 07:39 AM <p> LONG ... 21185 @qwx221185 <p> 07-11-2014 , 11:40 AM <p> here is a way to give u a good boost for getting LP ... u know the lvl 45 weapon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guy in Demarech , and the rest from the masters in Navea . <p> crafting each of those weapons give 250LP . We have 11 classes right now , which means u can get up to 2750 LP by crafting all of them . just farm the mats and u can make them . <p> also , if U can already craft a zaahir weapon , crafting one of each type of weapon gives 500LP . <p> now , there is another thing u can do , if u havent done this yet , u can try to listen to all conversations , each gives a puny 3LP ( or5LP I think ) , but , since there is a whole bunch of them , u can still get some decent LP. oh , and the tiring Oddities too ( although this takes quite some time to finish ) <p> now for the usual LP farming , they already said some of the most effective ways ( ToE , Skandia , Helonia , daily quests ) ... try to do the crafting quest religiously ( at least the lvl 50 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 300LP/day ) . the three daily side quests that give LP/day are .. <p> - Daily Achievements ( Check your Journal , and the easiest ones are your Gathering , Top Kills &amp; Elite Monsters ) , you 'll be required to do like " Gather Red Ore x3 " , Kill Argus ( Party Mode ) , Defeat Bayin etc . Each of these rewards 25 LP . If you do most/all of the ones I listed , you 'll get around 500-550 LPs just for those . Make yourself a daily checklist , organize location for effeciency. - General Achievements Check your Journal ! A great way to get LP is just by doing things you have n't done before . Go out of your way to gather ingredients to cook , or dabble in Alchemy ! Rewards vary , but for first timers you may find you get a decent amount . - Eidolon Temple Boss kills = 40 LP , you 're assured that amount just by doing Temple , though normally with lvl 60 boxes , you 'll be gaining anywhere to 10-150+LPs depending on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to weekends , it 's a great way to earn LP . On the higher floors , chest gives a few 50-100 LP hands out . If it 's your first time doing it , you 'll also get achievement for every floor = 100 LP. - Aura Kingdom Quiz Event This is only select day of the week , but if you 're decent at it you can get 50-100 LPs . Does n't take much time and is relatively fun ! - World Boss While it 's been nerfed , this is still relatively effective and it does n't take much of your time out to do it , if your PC can handle it . - Daily Side Quests Nyx mentioned this already , but the ones I do most days ( depending on resets , some do n't appear everyday ) are Cooking Quest ( Cactakara ) , Doctor , Doctor ( Triato ) , Veggie Tales ( Cresent Hill ) , Drop the Bomb ( Cresent Hill ) , Moonlight Rabbit ( Cresent Hill ) , Turkey Time ( Helonia ) , Messanger of Love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . All of these quests are super easy and not very time consuming . The first 3 are 100% chance for 50 LPs , but the other have boxes normally you 'll get 10-30LP . They 're worth trying just because of how quick and easy they are . - Easy Dungeon Spam One run has 3 bosses , so that 's 30LP . Let 's say you do all your normal solos ? 120 LP , for a super easy dungeon . You can do this every reset ( 1 hr ) , and you can also spam the other easy ones ( GG/MS etc ) . Depending on your lvl ( or if you 're DPS mainly : P ) , you can also solo your PTs etc . And , if I 'm not mistaken the Chest also counts as a boss , so during Solo Challenge , or Hell you 'll get 40 LP . <p> The best part ! If you have multiple characters , you can also do these multiple times . In the morning I run my alts through the Side Quests , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all upon each reset . <p> I do all of these each day , and depending on how lazy I am , can get anywhere between 1k-4k in a single day .

Once again , we will ask for your help in order to test the upcoming content . Our next patch will include the addition of Sky Tower Classic and Sky Tower Hell floors 36-40 . <p> Like many other Closed Betas but mostly in the case of Sky Tower , we need a good number of active players in order to check the content and drops ( mostly for Sky Tower Hell , of course ) . The players will need to be active and have available free time to do run tests with the rest of the group for the following 14 days . <p> We are looking for players between level 85 and 95 to check the content , preferably familiar with Sky Tower Hell mechanics and with decent gears . In order to improve the organization of the following test , we will ask players to sign up in parties for the Beta Test ( between 4 and 5 members ) . <p> Only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the characters in the party . It should include the time of login ( in server time ) usual playing time of the whole party . In case one of the party members ca n't join at one of the testing runs , the team will be able to find/invite a replacement . The party you sign up on this thread will also be the party you will do the runs ingame . <p> You will have time to sign up until next Monday ( March 27 ) when the beta starts . Current Beta Testers will be wiped from the category , so even if you already have the Beta Test Title you still need to sign up if you want to participate . We are looking between 20 and 30 players . <p> We need people to sign up in already made teams , because otherwise it takes more time to organize the parties than the runs themselves . Not everyone has that much available time , reason why we ask players to enter the test server and find their party members to teleport to the floors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ someone is missing ( which happens often ) to ask them to find a replacement . <p> It 's always better , for you and us too , to sign up with people you can contact outside the game .

This is the closest to your desired defensive stats. http : **29;4905;TOOLONG LONG ... Her accessory set is outdated , using the 65 EVA set would be the best substitute as it would allow her to put more points into HP . Downside with this set up is of course the fact that her offensive presence is n't anything to brag about , for a truly DPS tank I 'd replace the bottom set with Lion 's Roar and use Bel Chadra as eidolon . Ofc that random 50 yellow trophy should be replaced too . By doing this you will have a similar set up as that TW Brawler/Tachi but way better offense . <p> Raimoo <p> 06-29-2014 , 03:03 AM <p> ... <p> yeah it 's almost similar to TW Katar/Tachi ( I would want to change that throphies tho ) but with Lv 70 gears new features ( enchanment cards , runes etc ) and new crafting system , i think we should not have any problem .

Atm , my Devourer set is almost +20 ( Just need 1 more pieces to +20 , it 's +18 atm ) and over all , the set is 119% . I 'm at 63% DEF with Green Float , Balls , and Serif Summoned . Once I get my Lv90 Guardian Buff , I should hit about 70% DEF . That 's just devourer set . Once I use the Lv70 Tank Set 1 and DPS Set 2 , No doubt that I 'll cap it alone once +20 'd . <p> And for that picture , it 's decent . But I 'm avoiding yellow gears as much as possible as it is expensive and Imo , not that worth it . Devourer set provides almost the same Defensive stats BUT , also provided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cheap as dirt . Even with my tiny 80k DMG , that extra 30% DMG to bosses from Devourer set is huge and as calculated , it matters a lot . Proven by " utsuhoshi " , the math nerd of OS . <p> Though , I think you 're talkin about me staying with devourer set when you said " Even if all your Devourer pieces were 130%+20 " . I wo n't stay on my devourer lol . I was talkin about me using Lv70 Tank and DPS set like the Lv50 Meta . <p> Raimoo <p> 07-01-2014 , 05:37 AM <p> added Costume and Enchanment cards section , but honestly you can use whatever you want as long as it 's good for your build <p> Do n't worry . I 'll update it soon since we get new content patch later . <p> 1900 . <p> 12-16-2014 , 02:26 PM <p> Okay I am a bit confused now .. Can you eyplain me the difference of Sakura and Blaze build ? <p> Raimoo <p> 12-16-2014 , 05:13 PM <p> Okay I am a bit confused now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Blaze build ? <p> Does n't really matter because we are focusing on %DMG in detail now . In short , Sakura build is for tankiness and getting Midnight Sakura combo , while Blaze build is more for full offensive and getting Flame charge . But now Sakura build is obsolete and not viable to the new content . 
@@23370298 @3370298/ 21183 @qwx221183 <p> Updated with the 70 &gt; 80 gear transition . Will update later with a stat comparison between both sets of gear once I 'm done starring mine , would n't be fair otherwise . <p> Fixed a mistake on War Exemplar . Thanks Shiohara for pointing it out . <p> VII . Level 80 and beyond <p> A. Switching from 70 to 80 gear So you actually made it to Level 80 . The gear upgrade from 70 to 80 is quite easy to understand , despite having 4 sets of armor and 4 sets of accessories , only 1 of them is actually viable for all classes . <p> We 'll be replacing Sniper Set for a similar set , a stronger tier of it you could say . 70/75 weapons will be replaced by 80 crafted , and a new trophy and 4 elemental accessories will be added to our arsenal . <p> B. Main &amp; Sub weaponGhodroon 's Soul-Chaining Harp will be our new main weapon , while Ghodroon 's Blade of Destruction will be our main sub weapon . Craft the Harp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The core is once again up to you as it depends on what your character and playstyle needs . If you 're the type who likes soloing , then a combination of Nocturnal/Destroyer is recommended . Deadly should only be used If you have trouble capping CDMG even with Greatsword party buff . <p> C. Armor Set We 'll be using the Damned Ruler Set . <p> As I said before , this set is pretty much an upgraded Sniper , so you 'll find similar set bonuses and stats on it . Top set has 2% extra detailed damage and bottom set has 5% more CDMG than Sniper set . Remember to use +DMG -DEF tools on all pieces . <p> D. Accessory Set We have two choices here : War Exemplar and Arcane of Permafrost . <p> War Exemplar is a straight Blinding Reflection upgrade , so it is n't really a bad set . Set bonuses give DMG , CRIT and DMG against Elites . The problem here is , the DMG does n't scale with our DMG +x% modifiers , so it 's merely a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but the benefits of using the other set are way better so we decide to not use this one . The damage against elites is nice to have If you 're soloing , but it is n't really needed for everyday use in party . <p> Arcane of Permafrost is the set we must aim to use . Gives SPD , CRIT and CDMG against Elites . Very similar to War Exemplar , but the extra SPD instead of flat DMG makes it better . If you 're already SPD capped , the extra 3k SPD will give you a neat % to proc a new zeal ( more info below ) and If you 're still not capped , this should do the trick unless you 're doing something very wrong . <p> Aim for Arcane of Permafrost , but If you ca n't drop it or is it too expensive to buy , then it 's fine to use War Exemplar instead . There is nothing wrong with it , it 's just not optimal . <p> When you get to Level 85 you 'll be able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of raw damage , your DPS output will be higher with them . They are a must for any decent DPS . Currently only Dark , Holy , Storm and Fire are available . Lightning and Ice will be added later . <p> E. TrophiesLaw of Past and Future . This Trophy has +7% Detailed Damage and a chance to proc +3% to all stats , which can stack up to 3 times . Very useful , but there is no way your DPS output will be higher with it than with elemental trophies against elemental bosses . However the difference is n't gon na be way too big . If your DPS output will be too low or just a bit low with it it will depend on your current amount of both elemental and boss damage , so you should use this calculator to check your DPS output for each element and decide If it is worth to use it . <p> Alternatively , If you only have one set of elemental trophies +20 and your DPS Bard is merely an alt , you could main this trophy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every time you switch characters . <p> F. Food Due to the insane amount of CRIT you get from Damned Ruler and War Exemplar or Arcane of Permafrost you should have more than enough to be able to ditch Condensed Snowdrop Ice Cream and replace it with High-Class Caramel Pudding . Our drink of choice is still the good old Royal Jolly Tea . <p> G. DEF&gt;HP &amp; SPD&gt;Zeal Two new mechanics were added to make the players even more stronger . If you hover over your SPD/DEF stat you 'll see the current bonus you have . <p> For every extra DEF you have after reaching the cap , you will get HP bonus . Best Defense does n't affect this bonus , so this means there is no reason for us to switch to it . We can keep using Deep Blue . <p> For every extra SPD you have after reaching the cap , you will get a chance to proc a new zeal effect . This does n't give your other zeal a higher chance to proc , but instead it gives you a new one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the higher the chance to proc it will be . <p> H. Shield &amp; Piercing Level 80 weapons have a new stat on them : Piercing . What does this mean ? From now on , enemies on Level +75 dungeons will have a new damage reduction shield , which will cut your damage by 50% . This shield is present on Solo Challenge and Hell Modes , as well on Sanctuary of Eidolon - Trials , Sky Tower 31-35 and future Lament-like dungeons . <p> So by using two Level 80 crafted weapons ( 10% each ) , your damage will only be reduced by 30% . At the moment this is the only way to counter this shield , so be sure to use both Level 80 weapons at least for Hell modes . For Party mode you 're free to use your regular elemental sub weapons If you 're into that . <p> VIII . End Notes This covers the upgrade from 70 to 80 gear . Pretty simple , is n't it ? Now you have no excuse to be bad at the game . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mistake with the War Exemplar set . It 's not 20% crit dmg to elites , it 's 20% DMG to elites which is quite significant if you 've ever tried using Shirley . Quite the crucial translation mistake like some other 80 things have . <p> Depends If you are going to use that Harp as a sub weapon for another character or not . <p> Harp has : DMG CRIT SPD HP <p> If you are also going to use that Harp as a sub on another character , then we can discard +DMG since it 'll be useless . +CRIT should n't be needed with 80 gear . +HP is nice for bloating , but not really needed , so that leave us with +SPD . Cool for overcapping and to help a bit If you still do n't cap . -DMG and -SPD are not recommended , we still need them and ca n't afford to lower our rolls . -CRIT or -HP are our choices . I have way too much CRIT so I 'd rather lower it a bit , also -HP makes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use it only on your Bard , then just +DMG -CRIT is fine . <p> Depends If you are going to use that Harp as a sub weapon for another character or not . <p> Harp has : DMG CRIT SPD HP <p> If you are also going to use that Harp as a sub on another character , then we can discard +DMG since it 'll be useless . +CRIT should n't be needed with 80 gear . +HP is nice for bloating , but not really needed , so that leave us with +SPD .

Also how did you get so much raw crit ? I tried to follow your guide but can only reach your crit % with 56 points in crit .. that leaves me with only 50 points in dmg : / <p> Your damage output will be higher with them , but you still lose too much CRIT and SPD . They 're useful , no doubt about it , but they 're not needed unless you 're soloing , and even there I 'd rather use an elemental sub weapon and a +12% Gaia Emblem than lose capped SPD , a good chunk of HP and high CRIT . <p> The difference in damage output would be something like this , assuming you have 0% elemental damage base and 20% from trophy . You 'll deal higher damage with elemental accessories ( right side ) : <p> but If we use elemental sub and elemental emblem ( left side ) , we will yield a higher output and there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And If you decide to use elemental accessories on top of sub and emblem ( right side ) , you will deal higher damage , but the difference is not as big as before it 's not worth the loss of stats : <p> This is however only for 70 gear and below . I do recommend 85 elemental accessories . You still end up losing stats , but it 's not as bad as before since the bonuses from 85 accessories +20 are higher than 80 , and the raw stats from Damned Ruler will make it so you still have capped SPD and decent CRIT . You also have to deal with the Shield on enemies , so elemental subs are off the table where it matters the most . <p> Originally Posted by itsabunny <p> Also how did you get so much raw crit ?

@@23370304 @3370304/ <p> This is a reconstructed version of MIU 's guide which is no longer being updated , but can be found here if you 're interrested : LONG ... <p> Introduction Hi there , my name is TJ or if you prefer you can use my ingame name which is Busujima , busu , jima or whatever . My lovely guildmates in &lt;Wicked&gt; tend to use Jima . ( Not that I think I sound like a Jima but that 's besides the point , let 's not derail from the reasoning behind this post immediately ) <p> When I started playing Aura Kingdom , I did so out of two reasons : 1 . I was bored out of my mind , and needed some form of entertainment that lasts for more than 24hours <p> -What 's better than a " Free-To-Play " anime themed MMORPG ? Not a lot I 'm afraid . 2 . I 've always been a fan of the MMO Genre , so naturally I get attracted to new mmo 's , and I sort of get an urge to just try them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> -This one is quick , addictive and time consuming . It was a perfect match for me ! <p> So without further ado , let 's get down to business with this thing the French might say lack a certain je ne sais quoi ! <p> Eidolons Now why would I start the guide by mentioning Eidolons ? Should n't I focus on explaining the fastest route to max level , easiest way to earn gold like so many other guides do ? The answer is simply no , this is n't a fastest way to anything . It never was intended as such . <p> Eidolons are the astral entities that helps you on your journeys across Azuria , be that by offering you with supporting heals , beneficial buffs or by simply being there for the added damage when needed . ( *cough* or to make you feel less alone and more loved while runing around solo . ) <p> Eidolons come in a lot of different forms and shapes , and not only do each and everyone of them have a unique shape and or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a new look ontop of that . And for someone who 's new to the game , this might be a lot to dig in and understand at the first glance . So let 's take some basic information at first shall we ? <p> How do you get an Eidolon ? You get to select one during character creation , and are n't the options vivid ? One prepubescent boy , someone who looks like tinkerbell without the wings and glitter , a baby version of Toothless , and a miniature Unicorn which might as well be called Rainbowdash because it 's just as arrogant and useless. ( sorry bronies . ) <p> Now after the dissapointment of selecting your first Eidolon you might wonder , what about all these amazing looking ones that people are running around with ? How do I get one of those ? <p> There 's a multitude of ways to get new eidolons , and with this being a private server there are even more ways than on the Official Servers . <p> So let 's go through a few ways you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the game will unlock quests from the eidolons , where the reward is a new Key of Gaia that unlocks one or in this case two new spesific Eidolons . Through just playing the game you will get four new Eidolons . Aelius &amp; Sigrun at level 25 and Uzuriel &amp; Gigas at level 40 . <p> While questing you will come across NPC 's called Traveling Merchant &lt;Random name&gt; , and they sell an item called &lt;Something Something Soul Box&gt; for 2Gold 500Silver . When you Right-Click any of these you will see that they fuse together 30 Ancient Eidolon Fragments to craft one Eidolon Key Fragment . Which fragment is dependant on the Soul Box you bought , and to craft one Key of Gaia for that Eidolon you need 10 Key fragments . So what does all of this mean ? This means that you need 300Ancient Eidolon Fragments , which can be bought from your Master in the Military Hall in Navea . ( Top right corner of the city map . ) One fragment costs 10tokens , you need 30 fragments which means that one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one Key needing 10 key fragments is 3000tokens . You get tokens by just doing repeatable quests , the main story while leveling and a lot of other activities in the game . It 's a tad time consuming , but if you do n't think about it that much , you will have the tokens in no time . <p> If you press ' H ' on your keyboard , a small little screen will popup where you can " link " your Eidolons to Gaia , a network of sort . you send the Eidolon off for a specific time and it can come back with the Same keyfragment as the eidolon you sent away . This has a small chance of happening but it can happen . Just remember to try and always talk to your eidolons in said menu if they have a " chatbubble " looking icon over them , and selecting one out three answers to gain Eidolon energy , or else you wo n't be able to send it away as often . <p> You can also spend real life money to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ points to buy keys , fragments and so on . So there 's numerous ways to get them , and one of the free ways to get them is simply going through The Eidolon Temple outside Navea . You go to the left of the Navea city entrance to get there . This resets every 3hours , and starts at say 12pm server time , can have a 1-2minute delay . ( Say you clear the eidolon temple at 12.01pm , it can then be redone at around 03.00am +- Beyond this there 's also the guild hall where you can use those Eidolon energy Crystals to summon Eidolons for you and your guild to kill , this also spawns eidolon at set times . Just pay attention to the guild chat and such . There 's also events , they spawn randomly in the world , there 's server specific events and so on and so fourth , do n't worry . You 'll get the Eidolon you want eventually . <p> And there 's one last thing you need to remember and this is the big WHY I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ active Eidolon , this will give you 5%-7%-10% of it 's stats to you , meaning that depending on what you picked you will get a certain amount of stats for it , say a class that does n't heal , would n't need stats required for a healer as an example . To be more specific and to clarify , why does it say 5 , 7 and 10% ? The eidolons can be evolved , and whenever you evolve it , the percentage of stat it increases will also increase . Ontop of this , if you press ' N ' where you go to feed the Eidolons you can see " greyed " out stars underneath their 1 , 2 , 3 star in the top left of the Eidolon Avatar window . If you hover over this you can see that each different eidolon can give a passive increase or decrease in certain things . Example : Increased Movement Speed , decreased critt damage taken , increased damage % and so on and so fourth . And then you see below that , there 's numbers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get these passives you need to max out everything in there for each star to get that specific buff , and the way you do this is by using Crest of Thunder , Fire , Lightning and so on . You get these crests by simply sending of your Eidolons whenever possible , and they can bring back such crests for you . But remember , that some , or most Eidolons require a few crests if you want to Evolve them too . Press ' N ' and read everything there , get to know it , learn it and remember it . And you should try to figure out early on which Eidolon you want to set your eyes on , that way you can save up the crests and use it on that eidolon to faster get these passives . <p> This concludes some of the basic information regarding Eidolons for now . &lt;Further detailed guide can be made upon request&gt; <p> JailBaitChan <p> 08-29-2014 , 03:00 PM <p> Level 1-60 This section will include the ways I used to level up from 1-60 , and what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so . The private server sports a few things that makes the leveling a heck of a lot easier and faster too . You get five times more experience from killing mobs and ontop of this you generally get twice the amount of items dropping too . This might not seem like a big deal , but compared to the official servers this is HUGE for us , and in the time we 'll spend levelling compared to that of the official ones . So let 's not drag this out too much . <p> First you create your character , pick whatever usefull or less usefull starting Eidolon you want , and then go through the prologue . You then " wake up " from something that seems like a bad dream of sorts , or perhaps a prophesy ? You 're newly awakened self are now found in Port Skandia , where I presume you were born and raised . You first quest can be found below your map , and if you click the ' Objective ' ( your to do ) below the quest description your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ list . If you 're accustomed to modern day mmo 's , this is a huge difference . No more running around like a headless chicken , or scanning the maps to find out where you 're supposed to be . <p> So where do you go from here ? It 's simple really , use the above technique and do the starting quests , you 'll earn some levels , get some new abilities , enoy path points and so on and so fourth . I wo n't explain your ability points , envoy paths and such because that 's entitled to the class section of the forum found here : LONG ... <p> I will however say that the main story quests are very very straight forward , and does n't require a lot of thinking . You pick up quests marked by Yellow Exclamation marks . ( ! ) Do whatever objective they tell you to do , and then deliver them at the Yellow Question marks ( ? ) to get your reward . Simple right ? <p> That 's as far as normal quests and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Exclamation marks ( ! ) These are called daily quests and can be done every 24hr 's , and they give more XP than normal quests , and give different rewards . Let it be known that these should be done due to both the XP and rewards they give , and on a daily basis too . ( It 's simply to rewarding to skip . ) <p> We 've covered Main quests , side quests and daily quests . But there 's two more options left . Fame Quests or Mirabelles Bulletin Board as it 's called , and daily dungeon quests . You can do five Fame Quests per day , and all of the Unlocked dungeon daily quests . Mirabelles 's Bulletin Boards can be found in pretty much every new zone , and the Dungeon quests are given after you 've followed the Main Zone Story quest to complete a dungeon . And the dungeon dailies are marked by a Blue Question mark ( ! ) <p> But when it 's all said and done , you 're ment to be around level 55 if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quests to a tee . What I tend to do is first scout what server I want , and then throughly check which guilds are there , and then apply to the guild that suits me the best and which seems to have the best community for my own persona . Guilds are a great way to get new friends while still learning the game and simply enjoying it , and perhaps learn a thing or two ? But another good reason to become more social , if you like playing alone is that guilds have different boosts for you , in this aspect AK offers experience boost and loot boost to guild members , up to a total of 5% for a rank 5 guild . ( But do not be mistaken , you should n't join a guild for the boost alone , that 's just wrong , rude and nobody likes people who do that . ) But back to what I do when I level a character is I always do the daily quests each reset and whenever I get a dungeon quest to solo a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and that includes Challenge , and the two or more solo runs I can do . It 's a lot of experience , and it will help you level up a lot faster . Trust me on this , you wo n't regret it in the slightest . Once you 're done with all the main quests , side quests , and so on , you 'll get some quests that require you to be level 60 to continue . And this is where the " grind " starts . You 'll go through The Eidolon Temple each reset for the experience , eidolon fragments , and so on . While waiting for Daily quest resets you will do the Three main dungeons in this level range : Ghostweep Cave , Ozymand Temple and Wrathborne Temple . The Solo challenge resets every hour so going through all the runs will make the reset in orderly fashion and help you level up quickly . And one last tip is to save all the XP Cards you earn on your journey , and only start using them after you run out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a chore while leveling . <p> This concludes my preferred leveling path when I start a new character&lt;Further detailed guide can be made upon request&gt; <p> JailBaitChan <p> 08-29-2014 , 03:00 PM <p> Reserved . <p> JailBaitChan <p> 08-29-2014 , 05:54 PM <p> reserved <p> JailBaitChan <p> 08-29-2014 , 06:01 PM <p> The guide is currently on hold as I 'm looking into aquiring images to use in the guide as to make it easier and more visibly appealing to read . <p> Accepting donation pictures and input for the guide . <p> Currently looking for the following pictures . - Pictures of the four starting Eidolons <p> - Eidolon Temple Coordinates , with a picture of the well and a Map Marker -Cooldown Times also appreciated in said Map picture <p> - 1 Star - 3 Star Uzuriel with a fantasy like background to show the difference in visual appeals .

Either way , I do n't really know how those bonuses works , but IMO : <p> say that you have 130% Base , then 16% and 20% , right ?

@@23370307 @3370307/ <p> Hello everyone , I am new here . I 've been quite an active player in Aeria 's official for about two months , but I just came to notice that their product management is killing me , their mystery boxes and paragon table is nothing but scam , I know we are supposed to gamble in those but it is a scam when you end up getting some HP potions ( that can be bought in IM ) , ESs , Eidolon Crystals ( are you kidding me ? I can spend 2 minutes grinding to get this ) , and many other trashes ( as well as there 's so many other flaws but let 's drop it QQ ) . Sorry for dragging this , let 's not talk about it here . <p> 1 . Firstly I want to ask , what is the main cash currency here ? is it AP ? Do people donate ( purchase points ) to get AP ? How are the price rates in the IM on this server ? Are they the same as Aeria 's official , lower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of getting good items in mystery boxes ( Eidolon essense boxes especially ) ? Higher than Aeria 's ? Like , how much higher ? <p> 3 . What are the chance of getting Eidolon key fragments ( or a full key even ) when fighting them through Dungeons ? <p> 4 . Is it easy to get Eidolons here ? Can I get a Serena or possibly Alucard after spending a week here ? <p> Sorry I have to be so specific . I quit Aeria for the sake of having what I 'd really want with my real money rather than getting trashes . I came across this server because I am really desperate . If it work out well for me , I might as well enjoy my time here for the long run . Thank you . <p> Wis <p> 03-07-2015 , 03:01 AM <p> 1 . Yes , the cash currency is AP , which you can buy via " donating . " I do n't know about Aeria , but a typical costume will cost about 950-1,500 AP here ( roughly 6-10 USD ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here , if you 're referring to the AP ones ; they 're actually considered a waste of AP . Everything is obtainable without paying a cent . <p> 3 . Very low , very low . And do n't expect to ever get a key from a dungeon . <p> There 's no need to be concerned about eidos here . If you 're willing to put effort into the game , you can get anything you want without opening your wallet . Also , do n't expect everything to be instantly available to you -- even if this is a private server , AK is a grind-based game first and foremost . I 'm sure everyone here is aware of this , but they still bitch and moan about not having X. <p> Esper <p> 03-07-2015 , 03:03 AM <p> 1 . Firstly I want to ask , what is the main cash currency here ? is it AP ? Do people donate ( purchase points ) to get AP ? How are the price rates in the IM on this server ? Are they the same as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretty much obtain majority of things through LP Store/Paragon . Our server has edited the Bosses to give 10 LP and x4 Gold amount . There are some items that can only be bought from the AP Store . Of course , you can buy those items off players at a 1:1 rate . Donations are welcomed to support the server though . <p> As for the prices , I believe it 's either the same or lower . I remember Aura did some price adjustments but ca n't remember for what exactly . <p> 2 . What are the chance of getting good items in mystery boxes ( Eidolon essense boxes especially ) ? Higher than Aeria 's ? Like , how much higher ? It 's pointless to spend on those boxes when you can easily gain majority of the Eidolon . Our ToE resets every 3 hours and we have SoE ( Lv70 Eidolon dungeon ; no Light path yet ) for some of the other rare Eidolons . You also have Sky Tower that tends to drop a lot of Hel and Baldur Key Fragments . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weekends in Navea and sells different type of gamble bags for 100G each . There are times we also have Eidolon-based Paragon promotions . <p> 3 . What are the chance of getting Eidolon key fragments ( or a full key even ) when fighting them through Dungeons ? Varies . Some players are lucky while others are n't as lucky . <p> 4 . Is it easy to get Eidolons here ? Can I get a Serena or possibly Alucard after spending a week here ? Pretty much the possible ways were explained in Question #2 . Serena and Bahamut ( I assume Aeria changed his name to Alucard ) are both in SoE . <p> Bank <p> 03-07-2015 , 03:04 AM <p> 1 . you can probably buy ap from players with a 1:1 rate , donations is always there of course.well the items in the ap shop are cheap 2. there are special eidolon bags here that guarantee a gaia key every time you open it and not just a fragment , so yeah you should go for those . 3. pretty slim actually , but you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and toe 4 . Yes , if you are willing to donate you can probably get it in a day but itll take a while if you do n't  spend anything like me:p cheers <p> Myanya <p> 03-07-2015 , 03:04 AM <p> 1 . People can purchase AP using one of the linked methods in the main site . Main currency is still gold , as the gold : ap ratio is still 1 : 1 roughly . <p> 2 . The chance of getting good stuffs in some of the mystery boxes are said to be ' raised ' in one of the past patch notes . As for the real rates , nobody knows for sure ( i heard some people saying it is much better though ) . <p> 3 . Considering you can buy some of those key frags through lp shops , it does n't take long to get certain eidolon . All eidolons from ToE is very easy to get since it is 16x faster compared to os ( resets 3h ea compared to os 6h , each box gives two orbs , each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loots ) . Sometimes there 's certain eidolon promos , one that gives full key in a box . <p> 4 . Not sure what you mean by Alucard . Is he Bahamut ? Certain eidolons are hard to get since you need to wait till the appropriate promo or paragon . <p> I can see that you are MOSTLY centered around eidolons . Most long-time players already have all eidolons , it is n't that difficult per se . <p> aika <p> 03-07-2015 , 03:34 AM <p> Alright , pretty much everything I needed to know .

@@23370317 @3370317/ 21183 @qwx221183 <p> I have to say I 'm on board with modifying stacks as long it does n't affect greatly the game 's economy . My main concern have n't ever been the backpacks sales , because it does n't matter the stacks themselves , people will always need and people will always want more size . My main concern it has been , always , afk fishers . Even if its indeed a game feature , I 'm not up to make the activity easier for anyone since does n't involve actually playing . So as long the suggested items are n't involved in fishing activities and does n't seem to have a negative impact , I will be up for it . <p> First of all , thanks for the reply ! I was n't expecting this much support ( thank you to everyone who has posted ) . <p> And , well I do n't believe there are lv80 weapon box drops from fish so this would n't be an issue at all . I believe they 're still 60 weapon box drops ( yup @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same ) , even from the new maps . I 'm glad you 're on board with it ! I have full 20-slots and I have to clear my inventory after almost 3/4 OW EM run ( single , solo , party ) because I get so many mats/boxes . <p> It would n't have to be too much of a stack increase - gear crafting mats to 500 or 1000 maybe ? They drop *a lot* and you ca n't get them from fishes at all so that would n't be an issue ; weapon/armor boxes stacking to 50 ( or 100 ) would be greatly appreciated from a majority of the community , I would think . Although I would like it if active players would post their recommendation for the number of mats/boxes to stack at . <p> Also it 's great to hear that backpack sales have never been a concern ! I just thought I 'd mention it because it 's definitely a possibility ( from previous pservers I 've played at least . ) <p> My vote is for 1000 per stack of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Badges as well . <p> I honestly think 1000 is a bit much for gear boxes , maybe 500 at the most but 1000 seems a bit much o.o i might be a little biased on that though since I do n't run party/hell a lot . I have bag trouble even just doing solos so maybe ... maybe that 's what 's needed for people who run 24/7 haha . <p> as for badges , i forgot about those . good idea ! no sarcasmbut when i say no sarcasm it seems sarcastic ; - ; i do n't mean it that way tho <p> * remove exp books as reward from the bosses chest ( no point in work 20-40 min doing dungs just to get 3 exp books x.x that 's not a good reward for the hard work ) * raise the amount of imprisoned soulflame and thread of time drop ... <p> Well , I do n't think that those should be changed , I have n't had any issues farming soulflame and threads as long as i had loot cards running . EXP books should stay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ *only* good things in them . But others will disagree . <p> Originally Posted by Merak <p> *as suggestion for bot fishing problem make dung mats(stacks) be sell-able to npcs and and put a value acording to the lvl or quality of the mat or the same as the wpns chest obtained from fishing <p> This would make afk fishing a lot easier and faster , actually , because then people would n't waste time with opening boxes and selling the weapons . <p> Originally Posted by Merak <p> remove the wpns chest from fishing same with fish gems that way will encourage ppl to do more dungs and not see 80% population in server afk fishing ... at least the limited times to do dung would put an obstacle to bots and make it more easy to track them ( ? ) <p> AFK fishing is integral to the game and it 's already been modified to the point where I think it 's somewhat okay .

I have n't ever heard of people botting dungeons so I do n't think that that 's an issue ( ? ) <p> sorry just pointing out some things about your suggestions &gt;. &lt; also just a btw , i was asking for suggestions about stack size . Your post should be a separate suggestion thread . <p> yes to 100 stack 80 boxes and accessoire boxes , yes to 1k stack mats and no to drop rate increase of thread of time , soul flames and willow <p> yeah the post that suggested that derailed the thread a bit . <p> anyone else with suggestions to stack size ? seems like most are leaning toward 100 boxes and 1k mats . <p> the only reason why i 'm not leaning towards 1k boxes is because it seems a bit ... much ? even if someone runs party/hell i do n't believe there was much of a difference ( from what I could see ) that would need boxes being stacked to 1k . Of course 1k is convenient but I 'd be perfectly happy and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agrees with 100 instead of 1k though . <p> * remove exp books as reward from the bosses chest ( no point in work 20-40 min doing dungs just to get 3 exp books x.x that 's not a good reward for the hard work ) * raise the amount of imprisoned soulflame and thread of time drop ... <p> *as suggestion for bot fishing problem make dung mats(stacks) be sell-able to npcs and and put a value acording to the lvl or quality of the mat or the same as the wpns chest obtained from fishing and remove the wpns chest from fishing same with fish gems that way will encourage ppl to do more dungs and not see 80% population in server afk fishing ... at least the limited times to do dung would put an obstacle to bots and make it more easy to track them ( ? ) <p> completely disagree with all your points for reasons already old post have been explained . Please we are talking about stack of boxes not change the subject <p> anyone else with suggestions to stack size ? seems like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> the only reason why i 'm not leaning towards 1k boxes is because it seems a bit ... much ? even if someone runs party/hell i do n't believe there was much of a difference ( from what I could see ) that would need boxes being stacked to 1k .

@@23370321 @3370321/ <p> i understand why is important in a mmo to have bound item but i do n't  see why make costumes bound after the first use . I mean if u have a costume then get another u cant sell the previous nor sell the one u have to get a new one , so i suggest either getting a item to unbound or make the costumes not bound . Its bad to buy them and then only use them with the impossibility to sell them later , this is , of course my , opinion but i think there are pleople who think the same way as me ...

@@23370325 @3370325/ <p> Since we now have the eidolon prayer system which requires us to collect 5 key fragments of each eidolon or 10 hero emblems ( for starter eidolons ) to complete the final quest , there 's now a need of a way to effectively collect key fragments of the rarer eidolons and hero emblems . <p> First let 's discuss what eidolons are " rare " . <p> I would say the rare eidolons have two categories , the first category being eidolons that have no chance of spawning in game and thus the only way to collect key fragments for them is from the linking system or other promotions . The second rare category being eidolons that do have a chance to spawn in game , but still have a very low chance of spawning , and then a low chance on top of that to collect fragments from them . <p> List of rare Eidolons based on those categories ( any eidolons not listed either do n't have quests for prayer system , or are easily obtained ) : <p> *Note : A few of these eidolons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that does n't help new players , or the players who dropped their fragments from that event . <p> The current problem with obtaining these eidolons , is there 's not an effective method of doing it . I say effective because you can obtain them by linking the eidolon or by farming them in dungeons ( the ones in the spawn chance list ) , but it would take you a month to a month and a half of linking 4+ hours a day to obtain 5 key fragments for those eidolons or 10 hero emblems ( also note you can only link 2 eidolons for fragments and 1 for hero emblems at a time ) , and farming where you get an eidolon every 15 runs or worse and then are lucky to get one fragment is not effective . <p> Some suggestions I have to making this easier ... <p> First one and probably best one in my opinion , is to change the linking drop rate back to what it was 10-12 months ago . It 's no secret for players that have been on this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hero emblems and eidolon fragments from linking was ninja nerfed ( likely cause it was on TW ) in a patch a long time ago . <p> Before the nerf you were able to obtain a fragment once or twice everyday or two days if you linked the eidolon for 5 hours or so making it that you could farm a full key in 2 weeks time maximum , same rate with hero emblems linking your starter eidolon . Currently I 've been linking my starter eidolon and one of the rares for a week 4+ hours a day and obtained 1 key fragment and 3 hero emblems , I know some other people who have had the same result . <p> Changing the linking rate would make all eidolon fragments and hero emblems easier to obtain and no other changes would need to happen which is why I feel this would be the best option . <p> Second suggestion is to add fortune bags for every eidolon so they can be obtained via loyalty farming , currently you can do this for Vermillion , Serena , and Endora . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approx 25-35 bags for 5 fragments totalling 15-22k loyalty points . <p> Costs of other eidolon bags if added could be changed in any way . <p> My final suggestion is to make it so we can purchase key fragments for every eidolon from the Encyclopedia for dragon coins , or for dragon coins + previous eidolon key fragments . This could be any amount of coins + fragments , just provides a means to actually farm them rather than complete chance based . <p> Any feedback , or other suggestions are welcome . Everything is just my opinion after all . <p> Wis <p> 03-25-2015 , 07:12 PM <p> Or the temporary and easier solution , slam all the rare key frags + hero emblems on the Paragon . <p> ( please do it Aura ) <p> Dawn1123 <p> 03-25-2015 , 07:39 PM <p> ripp future new players <p> I 'm all for that though . <p> Let 's make sure to include all level 60 pvp weapons in the same paragon . <p> Aura <p> 03-25-2015 , 08:28 PM <p> Let me pretend I have read all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eidolon prayer modifications ( not sure how easy is to do it tho ) but not until -at least- the system is fully translated ( something I 'm working on the moment ) . So I will leave this nice reading for closer in the future , and reserve my opinion for the moment . <p> Dawn1123 <p> 03-25-2015 , 08:50 PM <p> That sounds fair , but I will say my whole post does n't suggest any modifications to the prayer system itself , it suggests a few modifications to the ways we can obtain eidolon fragments and hero emblems which are required for the prayer system .

I can feel his curse , cast on me weaken . I can finally move again ! <p> I draw out my sword and approach . " Reinhardt " I say as I approach . I know this is my only chance to kill him . I can avenge them all and save the world from destruction . Everyones deaths wont be in vain . But I cant . Why ? My instincts tell me not to strike . Am I too scared ? Or am I wary this might be a trap ; that he s toying with me ? " Stay back ! " he shouts as I get nearer . <p> " Tell me , Andre Did she want this ? ! Was I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somewhere in Aura Kingdom , I know she 's waiting for me ! But if I do make it will she be happy ? " Reinhardt tells me . " Ive killed countless people , I burned cities , I ravaged lands , and even corrupted souls . If she was alive , she never would have wanted any of this , let alone , she would have never accepted this . I failed her . My anger at the church clouded my mind ; all my hard work ; paid off for nothing ; corrupted me . I never realized that it was only my broken heart " he continues . <p> He takes a look at the young envoy he has killed and then directs his gaze at me . He stares me directly in the eyes . I look at him in the eyes back . It was not the same eyes of a madman that I had seen countless times . It was the eyes of someone whose heart was broken . I immediately understood why I could n't bear striking him . He was the man I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind man . " Reinhardt What do you . " I ask but he interrupts . <p> " Tell me Andre , this girl , she made me realize my wrong doing . She saved the world in death . She could do so much more alive . She had the power of Aura Kingdom but that alone was not be enough to defeat me " , he said . I did not understand what Reinhardt meant . <p> He stands and draws his sword . I jump back and ready myself for an attack . Reinhardt only smiles and thrusts his sword into the ground . Darkness covers him in a sphere , then light . I can see a blurry clock face appear . I could n't see it clearly but I think its going backwards . I suddenly feel nauseous , my knees tremble yet I feel at ease . <p> Thank you ; those were the last words I could hear before everything turns white . <p> I thought we were able to beat him ! But he reappears and remains unscathed . I was too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in agony as bright red flames wrap around me . I gasp for air as it slowly eats away at my flesh . It hurts ! It hurts ! Someone save me ! The woman in blue armor who was my comrade tries to help but the knight wearing black armor deals the former a powerful blow which stops her . I hear him laugh as my vision darkens . <p> " Gaaaaah ! " I scream as I fall from my bed which wakes me up . My head seem to hurt and a hot feeling occurs . I suddenly remember my dream vividly . I remember the soldiers , the demons , the terrifying knight clad in black armor , even the pain . Everything seemed so real ; I shiver . There was also something else in my dream , someone rather , wearing blue , but it seemed to be the only thing I could not really recall . I try as much as I could and I feel a warm feeling trying to remember who he or she was but I could n't do it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daily morning routine . By the time I finish , I look at the clock . I 'm late ! I needed to meet the mayor 's wife today to run her some errands . I leave my home and rush towards hers . <p> " I leave everything to you . May Aura Kingdom and Pandemonium both guide you " , I hear someone whisper . I look back and see no one . I really need to hurry so I shrug it off and continue on forward .

It would make more sense when a guard can get 0 damage taken while phalanx is up . If it were added first , that means the flat damage reduction of phalanx would have to cover all incoming damage in order to take a hit of 0 . If it did n't cover all , there 's no way to reach 0 from taking the percentage of a number . Of course , I 'm not certain it 's applied after . Just going off remembering how easy it was to get 0 damage taken on a guard . <p> cenweard <p> 11-18-2014 , 12:47 PM <p> Tnx every one for the replies ! Really help me on this one ! !

@@23370340 @3370340/ <p> Well I know that our server is pretty much up to date when it comes to fashion and such however it seems like one costume weapon has been forgotten which is a shame , so I thought I 'd add it as a suggestion , just as a reminder so that we 'll get it eventually . <p> Brawlers currently only have 1 costume weapon if we exclude those girly cat paws , even with them included Brawlers only 4 costume weapons , 3 of which are just reskins of the same costume weapon . <p> Now in the picture below you 'll see some really cool looking katar costume weps , these has been around on the other version for more than 2 months and I 've waited for them ever since , unfortunately they never got added , no one is to blame for that since I am sure many people did n't even know they existed . <p> http : **25;5291;TOOLONG <p> Sorry for the crappy picture but that 's the best I could find outside of videos .

I 've always wondered about the starter costumes and the starter weapons , and what they were , and whether or not they existed outside of the first part of the game . You ca n't exactly find out since you ca n't open your Character Menu in the Tutorial/Dream Sequence/Thing , but at least you can know the weapon since you 're given that one ( and can open your bag/mouse over it ) . I 've managed to find costumes that look similar to the starter costumes , but have n't managed to find weapons that look like the starter weapons . <p> Still , the textures exist in this server 's database , somewhere ( obviously , or they would n't show up during that part of the game ) , so they should be able to provide these items as a costume through some method . <p> BunnyAlice <p> 03-28-2015 , 02:55 AM @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be good ( primary and sub costume weapon ) <p> DarknessZero <p> 03-28-2015 , 03:16 AM <p> I think about +1 slot for costume weapon can be good ( primary and sub costume weapon ) <p> Quite off-topic there , but definitely something I 'd agree with . I 've been hoping for such a thing for a while , but I du n no if X-Legend will ever do such a thing .

I recommend the following : <p> If you got further questions about anything , leave a comment . Basically this , although , it 's true you previously must have a character at Lv60 for being able to unlock the Necromancer . Also , welcome to the true Aura Kingdom . <p> Elpis <p> 03-14-2017 , 07:17 AM <p> At the same time I still recommend starting with the class you truly want to play in the end . It makes things easier overall and you wo n't get distracted . <p> Getting Necro is easy ... do mainquest on someone like Lancer until unlocking Candeo/Triatio , grind CC/DC until 60 , make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ access to farming Devourers . <p> Could n't be easier , tbh . <p> Also ... in terms of gear . <p> If you spec your stat point and weapon spec point as Spd&gt;Crit&gt;Dmg and Def&gt;Hp&gt;Eva , you will have little issues . <p> ( Mvspd for weapon spec first ofc ... critdmg only if your spd is high and you 're working on crit 60%+ ) <p> ------- <p> But anyway , what I dislike and disagree with is not that yes , these 3 classes may or may not be more difficult ( difficulty is always relative , necro was really easy for me to get into , but I digress ) , attempting to rather obviously dissuade people from trying them out for quite a while is not a good thing . <p> People should play what is right for them to play , not what is easy . <p> There 's also that bonus fact that Guardian and Necromancer are two of the best classes for melee/ranged respectively to learn jumpcasting on . <p> ( Highlight below text if you are interested ) <p> First , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not ( except sorc I guess ) . Guardian gets more aggro the more attacks they do once they get Taunt envoy , which includes auto attacks . Necro 's main damage output is auto attacks , and in addition they gain bonus healing when using Alia , which encourages autos for a bit more sustain . <p> Second , they both have extremely smooth rotations . <p> ( Guardian 's dps rotation is sword slash - thundercut repeat , shield bash has an awkward animation and longer GCD and will interrupt your pattern , for aggro it is good though , and if you can fully cancel its animation then you can slip it in ) <p> SS and TC chain perfectly into one another , and they can be repeated infinitely . <p> Focus on getting 2 dark zones as often as possible , filling in 2.3 seconds is n't ideal as the max is 2 skills , but if you jump it properly the autos will make up for it . 0.6 + 0.8 or 0.6 + 0.9 are the best you can do , since SF @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The main deal though is SF chains and almost guarantees a perfect FT , DI , or ST followup with appropriate autos , without the need to jump again , which saves valuable time . <p> -------- <p> At any rate the main point is , do n't make any class out to be unappealing . Making them appealing is of course good , but do n't diss the others . <p> AGray <p> 03-14-2017 , 07:32 AM <p> i suggest not to start with a lancer , even if the the most OP class , everything you need for the class is really expensive ( easily x10 times more than the other classes ) <p> well anything which is expensive like lava stone and masterys is optional stuff and wont change the fact that it deals a retarded amount of dmg paying 3-5k for a lava stone that gives only 7% more base dmg and 2% crit is retarded anyway <p> but dps wise necro , bard , guardian , and even ravager are not really beginner friendly classes imo first 3 are just weak and to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do and if you are not used to jumpcasts and cap atk spd ravager will be a bad option for you it was a great beginner class before the nerf but now you actually need to know how to play it to deal decent dmg <p> most easy class to start with imo is shuriken the nocturnal skill is amazing and the storm deals not only tons of dmg to bosses its also a great aoe to clear any mobs : ) <p> but like people said just try what class you like the most some are just weaker than others because there is no balance in this game but if you get frustrated by a class its prolly better to use one of the stronger classes first to get geared and then you can switch your equip to a class that 's more fun to play for you <p> Nowaki <p> 03-14-2017 , 01:36 PM <p> but if you get frustrated by a class its prolly better to use one of the stronger classes first to get geared and then you can switch your equip to a class that 's more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> 03-14-2017 , 02:55 PM <p> hi kababayaan. still downloading the client . #pinoypride hahaha <p> Nithroel <p> 03-14-2017 , 05:57 PM <p> If you do n't  mind slow movement speed for a while , go with Greatsword . If you do n't  mind being ridiculously OP , go with Shuriken . These are the easiest classes that i 've played in aura kingdom without the need for gear .

First of all , I want to clarify the sense of this thread , since I know it can bring some controversy . I 'm not making this thread to encourage any sort of public shaming , and of course I wo n't tolerate any sort of insults in it ( which will result in the correspondant punitive actions regardless of the reasons ) . The idea of this thread its to encourage a sense of community in which we all respect each other and other people 's efforts . A sort of community-control system for Raidgroups that takes organization , and that could even end up in the encouragement of Open Groups in Sky Tower . <p> Second of all , I want to clarify that reports made on this thread against certain individuals , and mainly because they do n't respect the rules behind the Raid group they joined , wo n't result immediately in a punitive action ingame . There 's no rule against leeching , about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been annoying . We could n't enforce such rule to all players because we can not create a rule enforcing people to be polite or kind . <p> That does n't mean players does n't have the right to warn other players when they willingly invite someone to their Raidgroup and that person decides to behave against the common rules of coexistence . So I basically invite all Raid Groups organizers to post their experiences in this thread , of course without insulting and with the right evidence provided . <p> Players will be able to post here : - In case of leeching during more than 2 floors of a Sky Tower run or a full Sky Fantasy Floor , the name of the character . - In case of name calling during the raid group , insulting players , or intentionally not following directions for a prolongued period of time , the name of the character . - In case of breaking the Treasure Chest before the order is given by the group leader , or intentionally neglecting the order to stop hitting the chest , the name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the recruitment applications about the state of their character and equipment . <p> 1 ) All reports should be made with evidence , which means you 'll have to screenshot or record the situation . No edited or cropped screenshots will be allowed . 2 ) Reports can not be bumped or made in more than one post . 3 ) All reports that does n't meet the requirements will be deleted , and will result on an infraction for the author , that could be as serious as a permanent ban . 4 ) Players are not allowed to reply to reports on this thread , neither to excuse their behavior . If you have a complain about the report , you have to send me a pm to discuss the situation and I will decide if the report must be removed or not . 5 ) All infractions to our rules on this thread will end up in a punitive action ingame . This involves specially insults . 6 ) To break any of the rules on the raid group does n't mean the reported person will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ players can keep track of who they 're inviting to their Raid Groups . If the behavior of the reported person is persistent in time , it could end up in a ban ( if the behavior is persistent starts to count as harrassment ) . 7 ) After a certain period of time , and because we believe players can be teach to modify their behavior , reports will be cleared . ( Of course , as much it has been proven the infraction did n't persisted in time ) . <p> After starting the raid , a group of players started flooding region chat and persisted to do so even after having been asked to stop , since we need to keep track of who is 1 or 2 ( dead and has n't hit chest or has come back and hit ) as well as giving out designations for the different parties . <p> The following players have been banned from our guild raid : <p> The concerned players , collectively , were banned from the guild raid for the following violations : <p> Notes : *Due @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to secure any screenshot. **No screenshot can be provided , we only started to take screenshots on the 27th floor . ***Only to point evidence that the involved person was in fact spinning on the chest . <p> After starting the raid , a group of players from the guild Nightcore and Kurayami started flooding region chat and persisted to do so even after having been asked to stop , since we need to keep track of who is 1 or 2 ( dead and has n't hit chest or has come back and hit ) as well as giving out designations for the different parties . <p> The following players have been banned from our guild raid : <p> The concerned players , collectively , were banned from the guild raid for the following violations : <p> Notes : *Due to this happening too fast , we were not able to secure any screenshot. **No screenshot can be provided , we only started to take screenshots on the 27th floor . <p> If this would be an actual report against any of those players , I would have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take actions .

I can still accept non-rendered images but I will immediately inform you if the image you provided is very hard to render . 2 . PNG images with transparent backgrounds are still the easiest to work on so I prefer if you send images like this . 3 . Images should be of good quality and size . Small images and low quality images are hard to work on . 4 . Kindly provide me a short background info on the character/image you sent ( I use this info to match the siggy theme too ) . This is helpful but optional . 5 . Preferred color theme and overall siggy theme is still required . 6 . Post your requests in this thread so my inbox does n't get full easily . 7 . IMPORTANT : I will only accept a maximum of THREE ( 3 ) requests per week . If you see that 3 requests are full already please post your request the following week . If you need a signature right away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , mainly coz I have a very busy schedule , juggling between taking care of my family and my job . 8 .

@@23370351 @3370351/ <p> Behavior Report Infractors &amp; Infractions List In order to keep both reporters and infractors notified about their case and the rest of the community informed , I 've created this list that will display all future infractors , the reasons behind the punitive action taken , and the punitive actions themselves described . But first of all , a few reminders to all the community . <p> 1 ) Server Rules LONG ... Our server currently has a list of rules that must be follow equally by all of our players . Despite of that , not all of our rules have the same punishment , and each case is corroborated and analyze before a punitive action is taken against the offender . All of our players agreed to follow our rules at the moment of creating an account in our server , if you have read them or not . But we do encourage our players to read our rules , in order to prevent possible punishments . Remember , our most important Rule is still the use of common sense . Just because something is n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In the presence of doubt , always contact a staff member first . <p> 2 ) How to Report a Player LONG ... We do n't only have Rules for players to follow , but to report them in case they do n't . Actions wo n't be taken unless you follow the right reporting procedure . All reports must be submitted with evidence , we only accept clear , non-altered and unedited screenshots and/or videos as evidence . Reports must be submitted with aprox time and the date of the offense . Reports are always anonymous , reason why the name of the offender ca n't be display on the Thread 's Title . Read carefully how to report a player LONG ... before making a report , to prevent you and us waste unnecessary time . <p> 3 ) Procedure Not all infraction calls for the same type of punishment . Our server has the " 3 strikes " policy , in which players are given 2 opportunities to rectify their behavior before losing access to their accounts permanently . On the first infraction , players will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mail . On their second infraction , players will receive a temporal ban . The time of the temporal ban can escalate , from 24 hours to 1 month , regarding the level of infraction they committed . On the third infraction , the account will receive a permanent ban . <p> There are exceptions to this procedure , and it depends on how serious the infraction itself is . In most case scenarios , discriminative comments , attempts of scamm , selling gold or items for real money and bug exploits will receive a permanent ban without warning . Serious offensive language could receive a permanent ban without warning ( mostly when they 're more focused on harrassment of a single player ) . <p> As we ask players to use common sense we also do , reason why the intention behind the infraction ( if proven ) is taken into consideration at the time to decide the punitive action taken against the infractor . <p> 4 ) The List On this thread you will be able to find the name of players that have been already warned , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ players who has been permanently banned . Next to the character 's nickname , a general description of the infraction will be given ( and in case of temporal bans , the time will be also detailed ) . <p> Warnings does n't have a caducation time . So if you appear on the Warned List , keep in mind you already lost one opportunity and next time you commit an infraction , the action taken against you will be far more serious . In case you want more details about why you was added to the List , you will have to contact a Staff Member by Private Message in our forums . <p> - Warned Players - If you appear on this list , it means you have been warned by a staff member ( ingame or in forums ) about a committed infraction . Once you have been already warned , you can receive a temporal or a permanent ban if you commit another infraction , but you wo n't be warned anymore . <p> - Temporal Bans - If you appear on this list , its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serious enough to receive an account suspension . Next to your nickname , the reason behind the temporal ban and the time when it will be lifted will be detailed . On a future infraction , the punishment received will be a permanent ban . <p> - Permanent Bans - If you appear on this list your account has been permanently banned , which means you wo n't be granted with acess to your account anymore . Permanent Bans are n't IP sided , but they are n't lifted under any circumstance . The reasons behind a permanent ban are multiple , a player could have ignore previous warnings , or the offense can be serious enough to be worthy of an account termination . Although the general reasons behind it are described next to your nickname , you can contact a staff member to ask for more information about the reason behind it . Still , the ban wo n't be lifted .

I am wondering if it is worth it to really change the buff of some eido like ... amaterasu , diao-chan and astrea ( or athena ) .. from hp/def to damage type .. <p> As the main post says , you ca n't get the same star buff twice . So yes you can not get DMG 8% on both 1 &amp; 2 Star Buffs , that 'd be a little broken xD . Imo Normal Attack Speed is great cause you can hit between skills more frequently , but you can cap it . So say you already cap normal attack speed with the 25% , if you get the 50% on top of that , it 'd still be the same attack speed/it wont go any faster . <p> I suggest if you 're stuck with which eidolon to reroll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that you 'd prefer . For example , right now I 'm using Quelkulan because his eidolon weapon has a chance to decrease an enemy 's stats by 25% , which is pretty nice . But his skills are so-so for PvE . <p> I did n't know Eidolons could offer Nocturnal/Life steal buffs . If you have a nocturnal weapon , will the eido buff add onto it ? Or will it just not work ? Or ... ? <p> Cardia <p> 11-30-2015 , 05:21 AM <p> I did n't know Eidolons could offer Nocturnal/Life steal buffs . If you have a nocturnal weapon , will the eido buff add onto it ? Or will it just not work ? Or ... ? <p> Cores are a different story . The reason why you ca n't use two Nocturnal cores on your weapon is that two core effects wo n't stack together . However , as proven with Bat Fang , you can combine Nocturnal and another leech effect . <p> Which is why ( in theory only , I have yet to test it out to see if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be really fearsome under the right conditions : Nocturnal , Bat Fang , the " hidden " Nocturnal properties of some gold weapons ( like the 45 Guns ) and +3% leech Eidolon . Enjoy your 11% Nocturnal . Have fun bringing someone who heals for 11% of their damage down to the ground . <p> The nocturnal effects on weapons + eidolons do indeed stack , you can view it in your detailed tab ( Defensive ) . Same as Futu , I do n't know if the duelist noct stacks or not , since its a passive envoy node . <p> But ... it 's a bit of a waste to invest into so much nocturnal , unless you have low damage and need it to survive , then that 's understandable . <p> Code <p> 11-30-2015 , 11:18 PM <p> Eidolon with best skill huh ? hmmmmm so the candidates for pve ( not pvp ) are those that has damage buff ? and stun ? <p> Drake <p> 12-01-2015 , 01:04 AM <p> Eidolon with best skill huh ? hmmmmm so the candidates for pve ( not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stun ? <p> won is the first choice if you want stun , +dmg and - def debuff , hel is the second choice if you want stun , +crit+critdmg and -def debuff <p> aura kingdom already easy enough , just pick eido based with their look imho <p> Winterfurr <p> 12-01-2015 , 01:51 AM <p> Eidolon with best skill huh ? hmmmmm so the candidates for pve ( not pvp ) are those that has damage buff ? and stun ? <p> Usually eidolons with DMG + party buffs and -DEF skills are ideal , imo .

Despite of that , the people who already completed the achievements wo n't be able to get the medals , as we suppose it would happen . Thankfully , there 's a quickly fix for those cases , which I would have to do manually , but that does n't need any type of server restart or maintenance . <p> I 'm unaware of the amount of cases with bugued achievements we have at this moment in the server , reason why I will ask for your patience so I can gradually check each one . <p> What I will need from you , is to add on this thread the following data : - Name of the Character ( spell it if needed ) - Full Name of the Achievement <p> If you have more than one character or more than one achievement with that issue , you can submit them all in the same entry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clarifications : 1 ) There are two type of achievements . Single achievements ( which the requirement is only what expressed on achievements tabs ) and group achievements , in which you need to complete other achievements too in order to unlock them . The currently bug ones are ALL group type of achievements . <p> 2 ) Group achievements can be related between each other , and most of the ones posted here are . So if you post one bugged achievements , is more than likely you will have to post more than one just the next day . In order to save me some work , and not getting further delay , I will ask you to post only when you have those groups COMPLETED . <p> 3 ) The fix only works if the progress is done . So if you miss any of the progress , I wo n't be able to fix it for you . I can only fix completed achievements and the progress can be fully done in all of the reported ones . If you do n't understand the achievement , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in case . <p> 4 ) If you have chanted legends bugged , I ca n't fix it manually . And if its bugged , you can not get Main Quest Strategy or Worlwide Wanderer either . We will have to wait for a server-sided fix . <p> Half solved aswell . I can not fix the " chanted legends " achievement manually , reason why Worlwide Wanderer and Main Quests Strategy can not be completed for the moment . I will have to ask the dev to review such cases in which chanted legends are bug .

Some say they are raccoon 's others say cat 's . Me I say a cross breed of both but its a mystery still the same . <p> Tanukis love to frolic and play in tall grass . They often seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sounds of clicking sounds ( often compared to that of a raccoon ) They love to eat berries and other small fruits . The favorite to them are Rainbow fruit . The color and flavor draw them in . They will travel long distances to get these delicious fruits . They are a non- aggressive creature and will come up to you if you sit still for long periods . Though be warned that if you scare or strike at it , a Tanuki will attack back at you . <p> The purple fur keeps them safe from the elements of nature . Keeping them warm at nights and in the cold seasons . The marking on their eyes help keep the bright light of the sun from hurting them , also making it possible to keep from glaring . Hunters will often hunt them down for their lovely furs and make clothing out of them . <p> They love the tall grasses which are used as away to hide from predators and used to line burrows in which they dwell in . Each burrow can house up to 4 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burrows are made from them digging into the sides of mountains or cliffs . Some even make homes out of the insides of trees similar to that of a squirrel . <p> Its said that at times of mating season Tanukis often use their long tails to attract the mate buy fluffing it out to its fullest and waving it in the air . The female when seeing a male of interest will release a pheromone that will draw his attention . The only problem is that at times two or more males may be drawn in and thus causing a fight . Males will use their back legs and strike up at each other using their nails as sharp weapons . In the end of the battle the winning male is usually chosen and thus mating can begin . <p> When young Tanukis are born they look like little moles with hardly any fur on them their tails have n't fully formed yet as well . It takes about 3 weeks for a baby Tanuki to open their eyes and have a full tail and fur . This is when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when wants them will make a low purring sound followed but a series of small clicks . When hearing this the young Tanukis run up and begin to nurse off her . Male Tanukis though are in there with them , normally do n't  stick around to much to help out . Its been shown at times that while the female goes out to get food , the male of the young will keep a watching eye on the young to keep off predators . <p> Though I have seen Tanukis fight over mating I have even seen them fight over territory of living . These fighting can be more dangerous then observed in mating for they not only will use their back legs to attack and strike . Swift Flicks of their tail will often be used to defend and warn them to back off . If a tail strikes hard enough it can and has made the other one lose balance and fall back , even at times stun them . <p> The most interesting and exciting thing I have seen about the Tanukis is often seen on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is at its highest peek . They have been shown to stand in place with their tails held up high looking up and as the moon light shines on them , they glow and sparkle so bright . They then sing a humming sound so pretty that you are instantly drawn in . As they do this the plant life around them begins to grow more flourish and glow with life . I have to say that this was one of the most breath taking events ever seen by my eyes . <p> In all my observations of these cute creatures . I will say that they are fun and full of life . They if raised with love and care can even be a good pet for the family . Also take note and remember the glorious event in spring time . To let them be with their kind and bask in the moon light . Watch your little Tanuki glow and sparkle like all the others . With love and care they will return to you at home .

@@23370358 @3370358/ <p> Choosing your sub class once you reach level 40 can be a big thing . Making the right choice can either bring up your character to a new level or a bad choice can hinder you . In this guide , we will go over the differences between the main class and subclass , and how you can make the most out of your choices . <p> Please continue to read our Aura Kingdom list of guides for more in game information . <p> Generic Main / Sub Class Differences <p> The most generic between the main and sub class is the following : The cooldown on the sub weapon skills are 3x of the main one . The sub class skills are unlocked at later levels . The secondary class are generally weaker than the primary because the lack of envoy skills . Any DoT skills are overshadowed by the main classes if they are present in your party . <p> ( Food for Thought ) : Because half of the bard that you party with will go with Sorcerer as their sub-class . Thus , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sorcerers damage output comes from its Damage over Time attacks . <p> Based on these explanations of the classes , we have come up with the best combinations of the main and sub classes for you : <p> Main Guardian : Bard for additional Tankiness while alleviating some pressure on the partys main healer or Ravager to be better at Crowd Control . Duelist to keep better Aggro , Main Bard : Sorcerer for Party Play and PvP , Wizard if Solo Often Main Wizard : Grenadier for more AoE attacks or Gunslinger for better single attack . Main Sorcerer : Wizard or Grenadier to take advantage of Blood Seal + AoE attacks . Main Ravager : Duelist for the single target attacks . Main Duelist : Ravager for the AoE crowd control attacks . Main Gunslinger : Wizard or Grenadier for better AoE attacks Main Grenadier : Wizard for more AoE attacks or Gunslinger for better single attack . <p> Sub Guardian <p> Difference between main and sub due to Envoy : HP +20% , DMG Received from Bosses -15% , Sword and Shield Skill Level +3 <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to tank the bosses . In general , you will still need a main Guardian and having a sub class guardian is redundant . The skills that you would have as a sub guardian would also suffer too much from the triple cool down cost . <p> Summary : Guardian is the worst subclass to take no matter what your classes are . Your party should have either a main Guardian or Bard as the tanker and you do not want to draw fire from the enemies . Most of the skills that Guardian has also have high taunt or threat , you will end up pulling the monsters away from your partys main tank . <p> note : That I did n't make this guide credits to that goes to this site LONG ... katar class was not included on making this guide <p> Wayne <p> 03-02-2014 , 11:45 PM <p> Thanks for this it kinda summarizes a lot , however I do think some info is n't 100% correct and can be a bit misleading to new players . For example you mentioned that either bard ( for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) are the best two classes , I agree that bard is good but from actual testing myself and experience playing with a guard / duelist , it really is terrible , I 'd think a ravager or wiz/sorc would be much much better . <p> Incapacity <p> 03-03-2014 , 03:19 PM <p> You should play to your liking , and Guardian is not the worst to subclass , Duelist/Guardian is a beast at pvp , Survival rate is high , Two chasing skills , Decreased on damage via Phalax and return damage . It all depends on how you use things , It 's a matter of PVE or PVP , It 's also a matter of Playstyle. 
@@23370359 @3370359/ <p> Hello ! What I 'm gon na post is something between a helpful resume and a request for help . That 's a list of all the eidolons ( sorry if I missed any ) in aplhabetical order , with the buff they give with each star , the skills that they have that i think could be useful and their main stat . I 'll start with the explanation of my list : <p> COLOURS - ? Colour is for the starting eidolons - The lighter yellow and grey mean nothing , I made the lines of different colours to not get confused between different lines when we get further from the Eidolon name - ? Means we 're talking about holy targets ( if you 're searching for eidolons that give damage against holy , just look for the brighter yellow ) - ? Means we 're talking about dark targets ( if you 're searching for eidolons that give damage against dark , just look for violet ) - ? Means we 're talking about lightning targets ( if you 're searching for eidolons that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) - ? Means we 're talking about flame targets ( if you 're searching for eidolons that give damage against flame , just look for red ) - ? Means we 're talking about ice targets ( if you 're searching for eidolons that give damage against ice , just look for light blue ) - ? Means we 're talking about storm targets ( if you 're searching for eidolons that give damage against storm , just look for green ) <p> SKILL - SKL = Skill - I already said it , i just wrote the skills i think are useful , that does n't mean the eidolons have just those skills . - Explanation of what i wrote : Heal/-Heal = Eidolon is healing you/Eidolon reduce enemy 's heal Cleanse = Debuff Reflect = Part of the damage you take is reflected back at the enemy -DMG = Damage taken OR Reduce the damage of your enemy ( the first is a buff for you , the second is a debuff for the enemy ) -EVA = Enemy loses EVA +DEF/-DEF = You gain defense / @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speed , attack speed or speed , or more than one of them Freeze = The enemy is rooted in place Stun = The enemy is stunned <p> STATS As you can see only one stat ( two at max ) are listed . Those are the eidolon 's higher stats . Eidolons with 1 stat listed get a higher outcome on that stat than eidolons with 2 stats ( EX : Look at Abraxas , Bahadur and Alessa . Abraxas will have a higher crit than Alessa . Bahadur will have a higher eva than Alessa . Alessa will get high eva ( just not as much as Bahadur ) and crit ( just not as much as Abraxas ) ) <p> HELP As you can see there are ? on my list , that means i 'm not sure about what i wrote and i 'd like you to confirm/correct it ( That 's why I said this post is a request for help too ) <p> WHY THIS ?

A brand new mode to everyone 's favourite game dungeon , a brand new story for aurakingdom.to . Our newest addition of Sky Tower Hell Mode is n't coming without some work : players will have to re visit their strategies and practice once again Sky Tower 's floors mechanics . And of course , we do n't expect anyone to clear the dungeon on the first weekend ! <p> But with some luck and much organization , you may be one of those hard-achievers to get really far on the first week . And of course , we want to reward such effort ! So all raids ( guild and public ) are welcomed to participate in this weekend 's event . The rules are pretty simple ! All you have to do is take a screenshot of the Hard Sky Treasure Chest ( the last one you reach , of course ! ) . Once your run is finish ( or at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this thread the screenshot with the name of your character . <p> On Monday morning , I will contact the Leader of the Raid that reached the higher floor and he/she will have to send me a list of the raid 's members .

The LP rewards are still there and are still plenty good , considering how easy is to finish the raid and how little time it actually takes . A dungeon with such weak bosses is suppose to work good for level 65 - 70 gear but not for end-game content . It will still be rewarding for the people in that situation . <p> If you compare Hell Mode and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of " lost " , because it is indeed much more rewarding .

If you get leftovers , sell them to cooking chef npc in Navea . You 'll need tokens for the green version of knives anyway . Also , a guildmate of mine made a mistake of painstakingly making floats/pop rocks at rank 2 only to find he ca n't get arctic knives because of the rank-he could 've sold those same gold pop rocks in ST and make back some gold to buy more ingredients and he was just a starting newb too . <p> Best of luck , getting from rank 4-6 is a real torturing grind since Cooking is all about skill and 0 RNG ( which is also the beauty of this production rank ) <p> If you want faster leveling boosts ( for other ranks too ) do Gathering production first , you need to get ingredients anyway and its the easiest .

@@23370368 @3370368/ <p> Note : whever you see " I " here , it refers to utsuhoshi , the original poster , not me <p> These are the notes that I have gathered regarding the game 's mechanics , and comparisons between them . This is meant to be a discussion thread later on about which stat will have more value over the other in terms of overall effectiveness , but of course depending on your situation and build . <p> I 've already quit the game so I feel urged to post this all , as some of the mechanics to be stated in this are not really well-known for the players . For example , the damage reduction mechanics and the HP stat from stat point allocation are a little different than what people assume . It 's kind of a waste to just erase these all from my folders . <p> These are mostly self-tested , or with ayadreamy , so please do correct if there 's anything wrong with the mechanics . However , for valuing stats themselves , I should say there is no right or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing . <p> I will update this as I translate and clean up more notes and spreadsheets . <p> Damage Reduction Elemental armors reduce incoming damage of the same element by 25% . Base , boss , player and elite damage reduction : These are not additive . Damage is reduced by 100%- ( 100%-base DR ) ( 100%-specific DR ) . <p> Stat Adjustment by Level <p> As the character and target level increases , higher amounts of some stats are needed to achieve the same % values . Crit and Defense are affected by the enemy 's level . Speed and eva are based on the character 's level . If a higher level enemy is attacking you , your defense is significantly reduced but your eva against it will remain the same . <p> " Stat cap " equation : 30*lv2+150 Stat % = ( stat# ) ( 100% ) / ( stat cap ) Of course , this is not the amount to reach the actual stat caps , this is only the theoretical value needed to reach 100% . Speed will cap at 50% of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> This information is n't really significant for speed and eva , as there are stats that you will attempt to cap depending on your level , and should be adjusted with your stat build and stat allocation beforehand . However , since crit and def are dependent on the enemy 's level , the content you tackle should be something to consider . For a quick estimate , multiply your current stat or divide your goal stat by ( your level / enemy level ) 2 to compare . <p> Player Stat Allocation <p> As you level , you gain stat points that you can allocate on your offensive and defensive stats . This is the most flexible stat source that you have , and can be adjusted with just a small amount of gold . Though it 's pointless to try compare offensive and defensive stats from this , as you get separate point pools from them . <p> Offensive stats : 0.35% per point on damage 0.25% per point on crit 0.30% per point on speed Remember that this is adjusted to your level . Speed is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and crit% is dependent on the target 's level . For example , if you 're level 70 , every point you add actually only adds around 0.125% crit rate against level 100 targets . <p> Since speed is highly dependent on build and how certain skill rotations fit , I will not detail when you should pump speed or crit/damage . Most players will be building to aim a certain amount of speed anyway . Just remember that the ratio of speed and crit is 6:5 , so do n't sacrifice 6 speed for 5 crit from equipment if you 're pumping both from stat points . <p> Now , for damage vs crit , it 's a common mistake for most players to fill in a single stat , damage or crit , and not considering hybrid . More often than not , a lv70 player will benefit more from doing hybrid than leaning to a specific stat . <p> Damage and crit both have a linear increase on your overall damage . So the best way to maximize their effect on your stats is not to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that these multipliers will be equal . A simple way to explain this is this simple question : what pair of numbers with a sum of 20 will have the highest product ? Of course , it 's 10x10 . If you favor a single stat , 19x1=19 , 15x5=75 , you just wo n't be able to maximize it . <p> This is not as simple as placing 50/50 on your stat points though . It will max out at the point where 0.35% damage gives as much as 0.25% crit rate on your overall damage ( explanation is too much math ) . <p> Base damage multiplier is a little hard to obtain , but kinda basic : the % of your overall skill damage relative to your base damage . You should take your base damage first . Easiest way do find it is to check how much 1% adds to your damage , then multiply that value by 100 . To find the overall damage , take the skill damage of one of your skills on the tooltip , now with the buffs you usually have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skill damage guide ) . Divide that by your base damage and you 'll get the base damage multiplier with around 120% to 250% . <p> Then to compare it with your base damage multiplier , divide that by : ( crit damage - 100% ) ( 0.25% ) /0.35% If the result is higher than your base damage multiplier , then you need to adjust stats and add more damage . If it 's lower , you need to adjust to add more crit . <p> So what that does mean ? It simply means that ... It 's not worth going through all that math . Really . <p> So just simplify it . At capped crit damage , just aim for : base damage multiplier = crit rate If you 're aiming for content with a higher level than you , multiply crit rate by ( your level/enemy level ) 3.5 This is a good enough estimate , unless if you prefer the equation lasagna above . If you applied this and it still says that you should go pure damage or pure crit , then I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Defensive stats : 0.58% per point on HP 0.20% per point on def 0.40% per point on eva Note that 0.58% HP from this stat is in a different multiplier than the %hp you get from envoys and equipment . Therefore , the effectiveness of player stat point hp% increases when you have more hp% equipment . <p> Def and eva both benefit from increasing returns . ( 1/ ( 1-def-0.20% ) ) overall EHP increase for def , ( 1/ ( 1-eva-0.40% ) ) for eva , both increase sharply as def and eva increase . This becomes significant as you hit near eva cap , where the effectiveness of eva becomes almost 20x compared to adding eva points with low base eva . Because of this , eva is a stat that is usually maxed out , or not taken at all . And because of that , I will not include eva on stat comparison . <p> Def vs HP is a lot easier to compare than crit vs damage . Because of the increasing returns from def , it is really not good to split @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> These would be equal if you have 45.7% def without adding points to it . If you have over 45.7% def , you 'll get more survivability from adding def until you cap it , assuming that you 're doing a dungeon of the same level as you . If you have below 45.7% , it 's better to add HP instead . <p> However , this applies only if you have 99 points available . With a lower point pool , HP is favored more over def , so HP is more effective while you 're leveling your character . Also , against higher level content , HP may be better unless if you attempt to overcap def for your level . <p> To be added : def vs DR vs boss DR , armor cores , and other stuff . <p> Created by utsuhoshi , an ex-player of AK . <p> Shibi <p> 07-01-2014 , 11:46 PM <p> Dat ( ? ? ? ? ) <p> Lunarblue <p> 07-04-2014 , 11:56 AM <p> great info ... +999 for who thinking a whole of this .. as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter .... <p> Slust <p> 07-04-2014 , 12:09 PM <p> was n't def meant to be like this. ? ( this is more of a clarification ) <p> capped def ( i mean just merely capping and not exceeding 75% ) ( what i mean here is raw def. just reaching 75% def. ) at lvl 65 .. when fighting a lvl 70 the defense value of " 75% " does n't  remain to be that way . because of this word " of the same level " unless your fighting with the same level or your higher . ex 60 , your def remains 75% , but for lvl 66+ , its not even 75 anymore . i doubt it . so its better to exceed def values , adjusted w/buffs and foods .. higher than the said 75%. merely capping it makes you really soft when fighting people who has moar levels than you D :

@@23370370 @3370370/ <p> My first post here and it 's going to be about lore ! I got into Aura Kingdom earlier this year and despite the fact that my poor video card ca n't even load instances , I pushed through because the game really pulled me in . Especially it 's lore . I 've played a few generic MMORPGs around the block and this one just stuck out . <p> Anyways , one of my favorite things of the game is it 's lore . You can gather most from playing the game itself and some from websites . But there is certainly more to it than what I see and find . <p> I ended up running Sky Tower recently ( my second time ever ) and one thing I noticed is that at the beginning and end of each floor , there 's a little cutscene that has to do with the past . The farther you go , you start recognizing Eidolons . This always really interested me but I can never stay and watch the cutscenes because as soon as a floor is finished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bothered to watch the end cutscene then the raid group would already be at least three floors ahead . I know that perhaps about 98% of the player base could n't care less about the lore , but I 'm really interested . <p> I 'd like to know more about the Eidolons and their relationships/histories with one another . I 'd like to know more about the stories the Sky Towers tell . <p> I guess this is kind of silly but ... does anyone know of a way I can gain such info ? That I could read in English ? Or watch ? It seems like there 's a lot of info to be had as I 've explored sites from Taiwan that cover some topics ... but ... google translate can only do so much . But I 've discovered things like who they would have voice for each Eidolon ! Interesting videos ! <p> Anyways ... I 've rambled enough . So does anyone know of a source of information that I could go to and understand ? Or perhaps maybe there 's a way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thanks ! ; ) <p> Lyr <p> 01-25-2015 , 07:30 AM <p> Your probably one of the few that really is interested into the Lore of the game , I myself find it very interesting . It is why I hope I can contribute to fix the translation of the ones in Rainmist , Sludgemarsh , and and Silent Ice Hill maps npc languages , as its not translated properly , thus sadly makes us having to guess what happens by our own POV . <p> This might be a spoiler or people might not care but based one the major stories I found interesting are and I will do my best to explain what I think has happened on each floors . <p> Floor 1-2 : Researchers begin to built man made machines to aid them in their research or instruments for war , only to have their plans back fired on them not once but twice , though later on it was rumored it was the work of a abnormal existence . need to review the stories again beens a while <p> Floor 3-4 : Needing to call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken until finally Cyril has challenged the Guardian , known as Fink , after making a bargain , the man later tricked the beast , and striked the guardian , however the guardian decided to test the man first before he follows with the end of the bargain , afterwards , being resealed , that same unusual being watches from afair and disappears Need to review this again <p> Floor 5-6 : A old Scientist created a Creature and cared for it as a child , but others does n't approve of such things and used the creature for their research materials , causing it begin to rebel against the humans , in the end , the scientist calmed the creature despite being injured and let out how much he loves the creature and apologized before passing away , the creature also accepted him and called him ' Father ' before also passing away next to him . <p> Floors 7-8 : To Establish a peaceful truce between the tribes , Prince Gareth decided to challenge the cyclops king , if he were to win , such peace will happen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3 top champions . Once defeated , he moved on to defeat the king himself . After the battle , after such negotiations were met . Incomplete , need to review this next week <p> Floor 9-10 : Leanne 's home was blazed to the grounds leaving her the only survivor until the Adventurers came , and tried to help her find out what exactly happened , later finding a stuffed toy , this triggered Leanne 's memories and caused her to revert to her original form as a Dragon , once defeated , Two large Dragons approaches and asked the Adventurers to call of their attacks , resuming their humanoid appearance , its revealed they are Leanne 's parents and explained they are from a race of Dragons that was living a normal life until something had happened , causing them to be called elsewhere and left Leanne alone , after explaining , they took back Leanne and bid farewell to the humans who returned their daughter to them . <p> --- <p> Floor 11-15 <p> 11 : The Dragon Witch , known as Aveline was visited by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Margaret . After realizing Aveline is Margaret despite she denied being the same woman he loved in the past , he annouces he 'd stay with her and love her forever , but the woman simply turned him down and asked how its possible for a human to love a monster ? And dismisses him although heath would n't leave her , decided to leave temporarily to gain a way to be with Aveline . After making a contract with the voices , he had to overcome a trial , to defeat the 4 Elemental spirits . Once finishing the ordeal , Heath 's body as a human was no more but a large creature , named Vachnam . Then leaves to find Aveline . <p> 12 : Sometime in the past before meeting Heath again , Aveline stumbled upon the Monster hunters , who deemed her as a monster and needed to be taken down , Aveline told them she has no time to play with them and only wanted to take revenge against Tarvana , despite her claims , the captain dismisses her claims and orders his men to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ victorious but not without injuries , the man decided to let her go , and she was left to continue her path again after finding time to heal herself . <p> 13 : Continuing after Floor 11 , Vachnam called out to Aveline and surprises her that , now he is a monster like her , he can stay with her forever and promises to become her guardian , the Guardian of Aveline ! He said thinking it 's a good ring to it , but Aveline could only stare at him , and look away , saying he was foolish and its best he leaves her alone , and is disappointed in him , of how easily he casted his human side away for trival purposes . This however did n't  cause him to run away rather he told her not till she defeats him , after the battle , she insist he leaves since he cant defeat her , so he ended up telling her that , if he defeats Tarvana then Aveline would not have to suffer anymore and goes off to find her , causing Aveline @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> 14 : The beginning of it all . The hometown of the gorgon family was slaughtered , leaving Margaret who was away at the time to come back and find her home and parents in ruins and slained . Devastated of losing her loved ones and home , something begin to call for her . She followed the voice until it reached the unknown location where a sealed Staff was embedded to a rock . Though doubtful of the voice , She could not turn away , she wanted to avenged her loved ones , and slowly pull the staff from the rock , causing her body and mind to shift , and became Aveline the Dragon Witch . Having the lose her humanity , she was still overwhelmed by her new powers , later after the ordeal she finally unleashed her powers and accepted she is not margaret gorgon but a monster . and is on a quest to defeat Tarvana . <p> 15 : Vachnam later caught up to Tarvana who recognized him as of another Family bloodline whom she did n't bother to exterminate as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told her he is here to defeat her to free aveline from her suffering , this made Tarvana amused by his claims , after his failed meager attempts to attack her , she did a devastating blow , to Vachnam , destroying his body into pieces . Aveline had finally caught up only to watch in horror of her beloved 's scattered remains . Tarvana was shocked to known a survivor of gorgon has appeared before and mocked about Vachnam infront of Aveline , only to have Aveline silenced her , and vows to destroy her for taking everything away from her and for Heath , after the battle , Aveline was at a disadvantage until heath 's voice encouraged her , gave little bit of what remains of him to give her the power to slay and destroy Tarvana for good . After the battle . Aveline , stood there , accepting she defeated her enemy , but in the end she looked back what happened . She lost her parents , her home and even her fiancee . She felt alone and looks up into the skies , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continued . <p> -- <p> 16-20 <p> 16 : In a small forest , A Goddess was seen visibly lost and wandering around , known as Hera .

( i 'm weak with this kind of story ) i 'll be eyeing this thread for the 26-30 stories 4736 <p> lilblkrose <p> 05-30-2015 , 05:40 AM <p> I love this thread * * ) Feed me more AK story please 21181 @qwx221181 <p> 05-30-2015 , 09:43 AM <p> I never caught up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot about the Eidolons w I mean heck , if wanted/needed I can post their dialogue , answers and their background XD but let 's see ... <p> Hel : She has three brothers . Fenrir , Gram and Jormungand . ( Which I believe these are all Norse Mythology or something of such ) . <p> Endora : She pretty much gets jealous really easily and tries to impress Serif a lot and it seems like Merrilee is a bit close to Serif ( I guess as friends ) which is a reason why Endora is pretty jealous of her ... <p> Cynthia : Whether Twin or Alter-Ego , Cynthia talks about Serena sometimes and she seems to like Aelius a lot more then Cynthia seems to be . Of course being a eidolon of the night , she especially prefers night time more then day time . <p> Kusanagi : She is a Sword Spirit and a creation of the eidolon Amaterasu . Its said that Amaterasu had sent Kusanagi to Terra in order to help/aid those who want to save the world . <p> Baldur/Bealdor : He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little and had neglected any form of worldly affairs . Apparently this offended Hel and she soon started to resent him . Baldur 's mother also had asked all creatures to not harm Baldur which they agreed to do . This is why Baldur did n't fear any fight that he faced and soon was able to stand at the front lines for war/battle . <p> Tigerius Caesar : Emperor/Lord of beasts . His soul was preserved in a everlasting body and basically does as he pleases whenever he wants to . <p> Cleopawtra : Supposedly the last of the feline queens . She has quite a temper and believes women can do things just as well as guys ( if not better ) and seems to have a relation/connection/fond side to Tigerius Caesar . <p> Lyr <p> 05-30-2015 , 12:12 PM <p> Ah so this is where the thread went . I have to update the Lore of the Story sometime today or tomorrow , for Floor 26-30 , 21184 @qwx221184 <p> 05-30-2015 , 12:44 PM <p> I hope that once we get Fenrir , her ( ? ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her ( ? ) <p> Exrael <p> 05-30-2015 , 01:34 PM <p> the thing with Endora 's jealousy is a bit more complicated , if you know the original names of the chibi trio Merrilee is Eve , Serif is Adam , and Endora is Lilith Lilith was , supposedly , the first woman created , but she went to the dark side ( she refused to be submissive to Adam , stating that they are equal , because they were both created from clay ) so Eve was created afterwards from Adam 's rib I guess she was jealous of Eve for having Adam 's love <p> idk every eidolon has something to do with mythology <p> Alkurem <p> 05-30-2015 , 04:11 PM <p> All dis from OS forums <p> For those of you who are curious and interested , all the eidolons have a different name in the original Taiwan server . All of them are named after some sort of popular figure , being god , warrior , etc . <p> Here is a list of our eidolon name vs original names , as well as where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so feel free to correct me , or add anymore information <p> With this list in mind , you can soon realize that Athena , Serena , and Aelius are siblings ; Amaterasu ( a loli ) seems to be the owner of Kusanagi . There 's many more relationship you can find between each eidolons lol , it can be quiet interesting . <p> Oh here are some funny/interesting relationship of each Eidolon in the game taken from their conversations . Source : LONG ... <p> Diao Chan and Athena are frenamies , they often fight each other to test out their skills Diao Chan is a yaoi fan Athena sometimes wishes to fight Alucard to test her skills Hel really likes Bealdor , but after what happened she does n't know what to do Yanaros had 3 best friends , and are named after each of its Eidolon combo attacks Uriel , Uzuriel , Serif , and Merillee are all from an " organization " Uriel seems to have a thing with guys ( nosebleed ) Uriel seemed to had a band together with Hansel , Gretal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stage and was kicked out . Now he is replaced by Giga Uriel seemed to had a thing with Uzuriel , it was extremely complicated . This made Uzuriel not able to face Uriel directly ( probably because Uriel is in le closet ) Gigas and Quelkulan are archenemies ( since they are Hercules and Hydra from Greek Mythology ) Nazrudin hinted that she knows of Uzuriel 's past , but never told the player Serif likes Merillee , but he is friend zoned by her . He said he does n't know why Merillee LOVES Alessa , because she said Pegasus is every girl 's dream Alessa is extremely afraid of Merillee because of Endora secretly likes Serif Endora and Alessa are good friends because they both view Merillee as a threat ( because of above reasons ) Zaahir secretly like Tsubaki Tsubaki 's cooking skills are extremely " special " , even Zaahir is afraid to try it Tsubaki cares a lot about her thighs . Never mention that she has big thighs around her Kotonoha likes inari sushi and soy tofu Athena knows of Serena 's dark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Athena will give you the wtf expression When Alucard was younger , he was pretty wild . He seemed to have destroyed couple dozen worlds Beadler have very little friends . He stated that other than his family members , his only friend is the huge sword on his back ( it has a name too ! ) Sigrun sometimes chat about the whole cut scene u see at Helonia Kusanagi do n't like it when you tell her that she looks like Kaiser Kusanagi 's dad is Orochimon ( the eight headed snake ) . Since Amaterasu killed Orochimon , Kusanagi now takes form of Amaterasu 's liking . ( that is just wrong , since you know , Amaterasu is a loli ) Tigerius and Cleopawtra ... well DUH Vermillion is an orphan ( but she is a Phoenix .. wha .. ? ) , her clothing is what her parents left for her Zaahir is n't a dragon , he does n't even know what he is <p> I 'm sure there 's a lot more for u guys to discover ! ! 21184 @qwx221184 <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> After reading this .....

After the battle ceased , Shirley and Elias were missing , causing the survivors to look for them , finding Elias who managed to survive but unconscious and severely injured , with no signs of Shirley anywhere . A Few hours later the Army Officer and Commanding Officer reported to Elias who awoken and demanded to know where Shirley is at , Both of them unable to give him proper responses or news , Elias begin to get enraged , asking them why are they giving up on the search for her ? He did so much for them only for them not to accomplish a single search for her . Soon he demanded them to leave him alone , forcing the Two to do what he requested for . Leaving him alone to quell in anger and depression . <p> 27 : Shirley went missing , Elias was wounded and sent back to the infirmary , he protested to go out as a Soldier should be , forcing his Commanding officer to let him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a suspicious Scientist came , and offered him to see Shirley if he comes with him . So they come to a place where the Scientist offers Elias to aid him in controlling a madmade machine , Elias was suspicious as to why he was chosen but when left with a reason to be with Shirley , Elias decided to ride the Robot to proceed to use its newfound power . After the phase Test , Elias was called to stop , and was told he is to control the robot for war , Elias aware of this went ahead to take in his role for a goal . <p> 28 : Shirley was actually found and captured by what it appeared to be bandits ? Who tried to decide what to do with her , wanting to try out a new experiment , they forced Shirley who wanted to escape to go back to Elias and the Knights , To Drink a mysterious potion . Shirley groaned , and felt dizzy , soon she screamed , becoming a hideous beast of a monster . The Creature glares down at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . After the battle with the remaining bandits , Shirley , who is now the Crimson Shadow , begin to she 'd tear for what she done but same time begin to laugh , thanking to herself that , Elias wasn ; t here to be part of the slaughter , as she felt her soul is slowly slipping away until she heard a voice calling out to her , unsure why but she begin to follow the voice , while everyone else chased after her . <p> 29 : Elias was resting after the previous battle and taking on the Machine of War . He could n't rest like this he needed to find Shirley , Even if his body is taking its toll on his body he does n't  care if he will die by the time he finds her , as long she is safe . Hearing about the Devil is coming , he begin to take plan of action and took control of the Machine and went to the frontlines , to confront the Devil , he soon noticed something but went back to take out the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new enemy , but instantly , despite the new appearance , he can tell that was shirley , as he cried out to her , causing Shirley who was slowly merging herself with the carnage of insanity , begin to flee after realizing Elias figured her out , as Elias chased after her , as the rest of the knights . <p> 30 : Elias chased after the Creature , who has a familiar feeling to Shirley , with the Knights closely behind him and puzzled , they shouted to him to fall back or seize the creature , but Elias was no fool , the Creature was Shirley , his shirley . Refusing to harm , her , he turned his backs against the knights declaring that Creature is Shirley , the knights begin to become confused and unconvinced that the fact the creature they been pursuing was Shirley . The Commanding officer , soon deemed Elias as unstabled and ordered the knights to attack the Duo , causing Elias to fight together with shirley to protect her . In the end , both Duo were severely injured , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not harm Shirley , until everyone realized he was telling the truth , Russel rushed out , and ordered everyone to attack them both , at first no one wanted to , because Elias an Shirley was their friends and of importance , even the officer could n't raise his blade to them . Russel then threatened all of them that if they do not kill them , everyone will be sentenced to Treason . Elias argued back and realized what Russel 's real scheme was , but knew full well his comrades are unable to go against Russel 's official orders , as everyone looks sadly to the Two apologizing , before they raised their weapons and charged at the Two . Before their final moments , Shirley told Elias she is happy she can be with him til the end , as Elias responded , they will now forever be together and never to be separated ever again before their Fate came before them 21181 @qwx221181 <p> 06-07-2015 , 07:37 AM <p> Fenrir : Child of Loki and Sister ( Really It 's Brother Of ) Hel . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her prey .

@@23370372 @3370372/ <p> When to chose between these two ? friend been asking me a lot about it and to be honest I have both on analysis . So let 's Disccuss about it and allow the community to get a general idea eh ? <p> Example let 's see this person is using the double damage bottom set has maybe 160000damage stats vs a person who is using full crit damage ( 300cap ) and about 120000 damage , Which should use what ( zeal or divine power ) <p> And give the specifics reason why Zeal would be used over divine power and vice versa thank you <p> Myanya <p> 06-20-2014 , 12:08 PM <p> I do n't quite understand the maths . Eventho 10% of 90% is supposed to be 9% and divine power is 9% ( they should be equal ) . But somehow zeal is WAY BETTER . I bought the divine power with 70k dc just to test this . Your dps potential is greatly lowered when you use divine power over zeal . Again that 's just how i feel , 90% damage proc from zeal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing 100k damage normally . You hit the target 10 times . Each target has 10% chance to proc Zeal , adding 90% of your damage , meaning you hit the target for 190k . Meanwhile , Divine Power adds 9% ( so 9k damage with 100k base ) to each of your attacks , meaning you 'll do additional 90k damage with 10 attacks . Since you see both masteries add 90k , you might wonder what the difference is - it 's the fact Zeal is RNG-based , meaning it might not proc at all , but if you 're lucky it 'll proc twice , thrice , 5 times or even all 10 times if you roll that ( highly improbable but yeah , it IS possible because it 's RNG ) . And even if you proc it just twice out of 10 times , it 's already higher DPS than Divine Power would produce . Now imagine it at higher number of attacks ... <p> Genny <p> 06-20-2014 , 12:49 PM <p> Divine Power is an additive bonus to your damage and does not stack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does n't affect the base damage of your skills . <p> Zeal is a bonus to your total damage output ( not including DoT ) . <p> However , certain classes can gain extra benefits from having higher damage stat ( Such as Grenadier 's envoy passive which turns damage into HP ) . <p> Sera <p> 06-20-2014 , 12:51 PM <p> That 's even more reason to use Zeal over DP . <p> Heca <p> 06-20-2014 , 12:52 PM <p> sad part is I still do n't notice such a huge difference in a dugeon as I have use both but can put a video that shows the same result ( that would be misleading if someone found zeal better than divine ) <p> Genny <p> 06-20-2014 , 12:53 PM <p> That 's even more reason to use Zeal over DP . <p> Shhhhh .

Though yes , unless if you can craft 127%+ of this staff , Dark Wraith Wand is better , but expensive . <p> For accessories , use the flame accessory set : Sloar 's , Varis ' , Wade 's .

There are other options which I will explain later . <p> 1st . You are a GS . At lvl 75 you will have a speed buff of 3.5k . You need a mental focus +3 accessory set ( for +9 total ) , a back ornament with the +5 green card ( slotted w/ orange card ofc ) and a full set of orange-in-green carded costume to achieve the highest possible speed buff . So at lvl 75 , you will need 10.5k + 3.5k speed buff to achieve cap speed . Do n't forget your eidolon which at lvl 70 3star @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a toast food item from star sand when you ca n't use an eidolon e.g. Sky Tower ) . <p> 2nd . The staff .... is complicated haha . In basic terms , the more zeal-like procs you have , the higher the likelihood that the lvl 65 wraith wand will be better . Generally speaking , the Staff of Stars is a perfectly good alternative ( if not better in some cases ) and about 1/10 the cost . Use a destroying core for -10% def , protector core for -15% dmg . Nocturnal belongs on your secondary weapon , not your primary ( it simply is too expensive to try to craft multiples times with a nocturnal ) . You would n't need a fell in PvE as your passive accuracy is more than sufficient to hit all PvE monsters and bosses . Deadly may or may not be handy for you , as it is pretty easy to cap crit dmg without it . <p> 3rd . Accessories : The IA set is the 1# cheap man 's alternative for wizards . It is very comparable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skill dmg bonus ( and very good for IA with the set bonus of 30% to flame targets ) . Flokja is a rich man 's accessory set that will grant you almost 4k speed ( of the 10.5k you need at lvl 75 , much less at lvl 65 ) . This allows you to shift 45-50 offensive points out of speed and into dmg or crit . Also , the proc on flokja is 16% on crit to deal 70% bonus damage . <p> 5th . Top Set : Consider either the Baphomet set ( for the speed ) or you can consider using a titan/beleth for tankiness . <p> 6th . Eidolon : Zaahir if you are using Lion 's Roar , Uzuriel if you are using Lethal Beast . <p> 7th . Secret Stones : 6% crit dmg , 2% dmg reduction for tankiness , otherwise you can sub for 2% dmg in your stones if you are n't so concerned about living or if you have capped crit dmg . I would recommend using thunderous stones for your weapons as the HP bonus is pretty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( level 75 ) . It has a storm mastery because I alternate storm curse and meteor casts at 45% speed instead of meteor spam at 50% speed . There are alternate builds besides the meteor - auto attack - meteor - 2x auto attack builds out there . You will have to experiment and decide for yourself what you want to do . <p> http : **29;7149;TOOLONG <p> 9th . Movespeed : Movespeed is life . It let 's you dungeon faster , dodge AoEs better , and overall survive . I run with 125-131% movespeed before a bard buff when I am actually serious about things , but increase to 144+ when I 'm just solo farming or speed farming with others . The analysis of extreme speed ( defensive mastery ) is handy in most cases , but when you really need to live , switch to to courage or something more tanky . <p> Note : I 've mentioned a lot about bonus damage have n't I ? Bonus damage is the trigger of some special skills or items to deal extra damage based upon the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a 100k hit pre-crit . If I had 50% bonus damage on this hit , it would deal 150k . Now , if that 100k hit critted instead for 300k ( at 300% crit damage ) , the 50% bonus damage would instead hit for 450k , reflecting the increased damage of the hit that triggered it . There are many things ingame that will bonus damage to trigger , a list is below : <p> Yep , you can disregard my suggestion for Noct main weap if you do n't wan na take the risk : ) But I suggested Fell for some reasons : <p> 1 . Easy 40% Accuracy , 15% from main weap , 15% on PvP Weap , 10% Base accuracy on envoy , excluding armor and main weapon fortifications , if you feel like PvPing that is . You know what I mean . Since you said that you mainly focus on PvE , but you did n't mention about doing PvP from time to time : 3 <p> 2 . You can use all Crit DMG/-DMG Taken secret stones in all your gears. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you do -DMG Taken or DMG +2% in costumes is up to you , but you can attain 22% By all Damage Reduction stat . <p> But , if you really do not PvP , Protector and Destroying cores are best especially on boss fights . <p> redtand <p> 08-16-2014 , 03:48 PM <p> Hi !

Warning : It 's very long . If you have played for a while , you probaly know this already . This guide is mostly for new players . I also did n't noticed someone else posted it before , you can read it at LONG ... Sorry &gt;. &lt; <p> --- Balancing your DPS : Damage sources and tradeoffs <p> The focus of this guide will be to talk about the major damage sources in AK . Some are more important than others , but most of them are quite influential . A basic list : <p> Before explaining all these , some terms you should become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increases . I use these a lot when talking about or explaining tradeoffs , so it would be beneficial to understand them . <p> Multiplicative increase generally refers to how much your damage will literally be increased overall by adding to these basic damage sources . As a simple example , consider a player with 0% elemental damage , and then going to 20% element damage by using a trophy . They will gain 20% additive elemental damage , and 20% multiplicative damage , because their overall damage was increased literally by 20% . <p> Now consider a player with 20% elemental trophy that is adding 30% from an elemental accessory set . They are gaining 30% additive elemental damage , and 25% multiplicative damage . That is , their overall damage is increased literally by 25% . <p> How did I arrive at this ? Well , I 'll use some basic numbers to model the concept . We will assume their attack does 100k damage before the addition of any elemental damage . <p> So yeah , as you add more of a damage source , the multiplicative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This is an important tool when you are considering tradeoffs for what items or stats to aim for . --- <p> Detail dmg% : <p> Detail dmg% is an important stat in the Offensive section of the Detailed List , which is found at the bottom right corner of your Character Window . When this stat was first understood , the DPS landscape of this game was shifted quite significantly . The basic idea is that dungeons have a certain damage reduction value ( I will call it DR% ) which cut your expected damage by a certain percentage . For example , dragons and most heII modes have 90% reduction , which means your damage is reduced by 90% . The good thing for us is that we can counter that reduction by using detail dmg% . <p> An example of why detail dmg% is very powerful can be seen as follows : <p> As you can see from this example , adding the first 10% detail dmg gives you twice as much dmg as before , or in more technical words , a 100% multiplicative damage increase . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though , as the multiplicative damage returns will decrease as you pump more of the stat ( like elemental dmg and all the other dmg sources ) so you have to balance it wisely . Do the math for each % increase to see if your tradeoffs are actually worth it or not . <p> There are three types we will be concerned with in PvE-- general , elite , and boss dmg% . General affects all mob types in dungeons , elites affects only elite mobs , and boss affects only bosses . The most important one to focus on will obviously be boss dmg% , since most of the time is spent killing them , and more often than not you can just kill general/elites at the boss anyway . It does n't hurt to carry a costume swap for elite dmg% though , since some elites can give you more trouble . <p> As a melee , you 'll ideally want to have around 70% boss damage on elemental bosses and 80% boss damage on non-elemental bosses . As a ranged class , boss damage is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ranged classes work well with bard sub for an extra 12% if you want to go that route . The common sources are as follows : <p> So as melee with full sniper and deep blue , you would run around 69% detail on element bosses and 79% on violent . Ambusher + sniper bottom would have 77% on element and 87% on violent , but at the cost of a lot of good stats . For that reason , ambusher is only recommended if using lion 's bottom because it helps make up for the lost detail dmg and you do n't need the speed from sniper top to get high attack speed . <p> As a ranged class , your detail dmg would of course be 15% lower compared to a melee , so you need to make up for it somehow . As I mentioned earlier , the easiest way is to just slap on bard sub , and it generally pairs well with them anyway . You could also try using an orange main weapon if you like , but generally I think 65 weapon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about what works for you ; we have some other damage sources to cover . --- Elemental dmg % : <p> Elemental dmg is somewhat similar to detail dmg , just that there is no DR% for elemental . So your elemental damage is not affected by the dungeon in any way , apart from which element the bosses are . As shown in an earlier example , having 20% total elemental damage will literally give you a 20% multiplicative damage increase , having 50% total will give you 50% , etc . <p> Most of the time you will have around 87 or 94% , depending on if you swap armor elements or not . The common sources are as follows : <p> When you combine detail dmg% with element dmg% , you will really see your dps start to climb . <p> Imagine you have 100k expected dmg in a 90% DR dungeon and you have 70% boss dmg + 90% ele dmg ( just isolate these stats for this case ) <p> 100k * ( 1-0.2 ) * 1.9 = 152k Your 10k dmg would go to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dmg . That 's like fifteen times the amount you would do with neither invested at all . <p> Anyway , if you already figured out detail dmg% , element dmg% is pretty easy to understand . it 's just the same thing but without being reduced by dungeons . Main thing is knowing the main sources and carrying it all around with you for dungeons . <p> -My edit : Elemental armor reduces the amount with a % of how much damage you take from a monster/elite/boss . I suggest having from each element a piece of gear , could be usefull in dungeons . <p> ShadowLeaf <p> 07-31-2015 , 04:43 PM <p> Attack speed % : And jumpcasting <p> Along with detail and element dmg , this is one of the damage sources less commonly understood by the general public . Most people think of speed stat as just a way to let you spam skills faster , such as wizard and meteor . Well , that 's really just a side effect of the main thing you should use it for : attack speed . <p> Jumpcasting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but far fewer actually understand . The basic idea is that it stops you from being locked in place on the ground when using a skill . But when it comes to DPSing , there is also the benefit of extra auto attacks . You will get auto attacks if your character lands on the ground during a skill after you canceled the animation using jumpcasting . The best way to make use of this is by casting skills towards the end of your jump arc-- especially the ones that have longer animation times . It 's not as important for short skills , but very important if you plan on using skills with a long GCD ( global cooldown/animation time ) . Generally I consider .5.7 seconds short , .81.1 medium , and anything 1.2+ long . Master the technique of jumpcasting if you want to be a good DPS ; it 's important . <p> In tandem with jumpcasting , attack speed is extremely important for maximizing your DPS . When you jumpcast your skills properly , your auto attacks ( will refer to as AAs sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actually makes up more of your damage than your skills do . <p> So you understand that auto attacks are important , but what can you do about it ? Well , you hit your benchmark . ( There is thread here that has a list of the wepspeeds and aspd caps for all classes if you are lazy to follow the math ) <p> As an example , for ravager , with axe wepspeed of 2.6 : 2.6 * ( 1 - aspd% ) = seconds per AA <p> As it happens , the universal cap for all classes is 0.5sec per AA . This means your stream of auto attacks can go at a maximum speed of 2 per second , but it depends on your class weapon speed what aspd% you need to hit that . By using a little algebra <p> 2.6 * ( 1 - x ) = 0.5 2.6 - 2.6x = 0.5 2.6x = 2.1 x = 0.807 <p> we can deduce that axe weapon needs 81% aspd ( rounded from 80.7% for convenience ) to cap at 0.5sec per AA . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mark you need to hit on ravager . <p> Unfortunately , there are not a lot of ways to do this . The main sources are as follows : <p> So the two main ways to cap aspd are either use lion 's roar bottom or a combination of aspd secret stones with x% speed stat ( x% being the amount you need to cap after yarnaros + secret stones ) . For example , if I have 8% from secret stones , and 25% from yarnaros , I need 48% speed stat to cap aspd on ravager because I need 81% . <p> Now , some people will tell you that you do n't need to hit the cap exactly , just get close and call it good . Some people also do n't like to do calculations and testing . You can use whatever aspd% you want to , but I 'm going to suggest that you go all the way to the cap , especially if you use high GCD skills at all frequently . <p> As you may have guessed , this is literally the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Since there 's not a huge explanation I need to do for this , I 'm just going to show the main sources of character damage : <p> The way AK calculates your character damage is by taking your weapon damage plus gear damage , multiplying it by all your additive damage sources , and then adding on all your flat damage at the end . So probably the easiest way to increase character damage is by having a good % weapon at +20 , sniper set with dmg enchants also at +20 , and that 's about it . <p> Additive dmg% comes from a lot of places , but I urge you not to go too crazy with your stat points . Your stat points will mainly be used to hit your speed and crit benchmarks first , and then anything leftover will go to dmg . We already know why speed is important from last section , and I 'll be explaining crit soon as well . <p> Be careful not to think of additive dmg% ( like the 24% dmg from yarnaros ) as multiplicative damage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you might have around 200k damage with yarnaros buff , and 190k without . That 's barely a 5% increase in your damage , not to mention that your skill 's actual damage is calculated from both character damage and skill damage . <p> What you should do in regards to additive dmg% , though , is take it on all costumes and enchant cards that you can . The 2% dmg is worth a bit more than 1% crit in terms of stat points , so it is more efficient to get 2% dmg stuff and use the stat points for crit . <p> That 's all there is to it , really ... most of your character damage comes from a good +20 weapon . When star fusion comes out , there will also be that , too . ( -My edit : Star fusion is already out , also use it for your gear since it wo n't hurt at all ) ----- <p> Crit rate and crit dmg : <p> I think most people have a fairly good grasp of crit , or at least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crit dmg at 300% . What I want to do here is sort of illustrate how an increase in crit% can translate to a pseudo ( not exact , because of RNG and stuff , but close ) multiplicative damage boost . <p> Now this mechanism is great and all , but there 's some things that will affect this . First of all , our level relative to the mobs we are attacking . For every 1 level above the target , you will have 1% more crit against it . For example , a level 75 player attacking a level 67 monster would have their crit raised from 70% to 78% because they are 8 levels higher . <p> The next thing is ice trap . Ice trap increases crit rate greatly on the target for 6 seconds if does n't have immobilize immunity . So basically , when ice trap is active , any extra crit you may have will become somewhat wasted . This is something you have to consider as a gunslinger or gunslinger sub , or if you run with gunslingers a lot ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the boss die in 6 seconds ? If so , maybe do n't aim for as high of crit% . <p> The last thing is RNG , which is out of your control unless you hit close to 100% crit rate . It 's like landing a Focus Blast or Stone Edge ; sometimes you miss 5 in a row , sometimes you hit like half of them , sometimes you hit all of them . It 's just random . For this reason , it can be quite beneficial to actually hit values even as high as 90% crit ( on your target mob , of course ) if you want to guarantee consistant damage . This might be a good idea for high GCD skill users especially . <p> Main sources of crit rate are as follows : <p> -Gear crit stat ( for example , the crit on sniper set or your weapon ) -Flat crit% ( like from +20 weapon bonus , .25 times stat points , or envoy ) -Additive crit% ( admittedly rare , but is in some places like 1% all stat on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effects <p> My personal preference is to hang around 80% crit on the targets that I 'm mainly facing , such as in TR/CF dungeons . A bit lower when running gunslinger sub . <p> Capping crit dmg at 300% is easy , considering you will be using either lion 's roar bottom or sniper , so I 'm not going to cover that here . -My edit : For some classes this may be hard , try aiming at 200%-250% otherwise . <p> ShadowLeaf <p> 07-31-2015 , 04:44 PM <p> Main weapon envoy dmg % : <p> Probably the most self-explanatory damage source you could imagine , this is simply the 12% damage available to your main weapon on envoy path . It 's a 12% multiplicative damage boost , it just literally boosts your damage by 12% . That 's it . <p> Take them . Backstrikes : <p> This is probably one of the least-utilized but most powerful damage sources in the game . <p> The concept of backstrike is simple and easy enough to understand ; if you strike a target from behind , then you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understand elemental damage , then you can understand that a free 50% multiplicative damage boost is ridiculously good . <p> Mainly you will be looking to do this on bosses . Things like stun or a guardian with aggro can make the amount of backstrikes you do increase significantly , as well as practice and experience with repositioning . Anticipate when bosses are going to turn around , and time your movements accordingly . It becomes mechanical once you do it enough . <p> Of course , this is fairly easy for melees , but ranged players who are used to kiting around and evading will probably find it a lot harder . If you want that damage boost , you have to be within melee range of the boss or have someone tanking it in another direction . If you are the highest DPS in the party , you might be out of luck in harder dungeons . <p> But yeah , backstrikes are important , so do them when you can . -My edit : Let the one with the aggro face the boss one side , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Defense reduction is fairly simple . There are two types-- percentage-based reduction and flat reduction . <p> Percentage-based reduction is fairly easy to get in a party depending on the classes , and it caps out at 50% in PvE . ( My edit : Personal damage reduction can be higher ) <p> Flat reduction is a bit trickier , and there 's no way for you to really stack a bunch if you do n't have the right class skills . <p> Common sources are as follows : <p> -Eidolon skill effects ( Eligos , for example ) -Various trophy procs ( such as space time key .. this is a stretch , I know ) -Skills of certain classes , like swift strike from katar or slash cut duelist <p> As you can see , it basically boils down to whether your class has a flat reduction skill or not . If it does , your party DPS would probably benefit a fair amount from you adding it sooner in your rotation rather than later . <p> I do n't have any flashy numbers to throw out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the effect is fairly drastic . For example , a wizard throwing 5 stacks of their ice debuff improves my damage by a good chunk . The exception to this ( as well as percentage-based reduction ) is that dragon dungeons are not affected by it because their defense values are too high . After applying the reduction they are still at capped defense . ----- Movespeed : <p> Wow , I finally understand how sonic does anything in SSB . Speed = damage ? ! ? ! <p> Jokes aside , I 'm including this here because it 's important for reducing dungeon clear times . <p> Movespeed can be thought of as a mechanism for reducing your travel time by a certain percentage . This is important because , while you spend a decent amount of time fighting bosses , by far the most time you will spend in most dungeons is traveling from point A to B. I can vaguely illustrate this with an example : <p> Imagine you are doing Cadilla Felwood party mode , and your clear time with 100 movespeed is around 3.5 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and maybe 5 seconds for first boss spawn , 15 seconds for second boss , and maybe 20 for last boss . Overall , let 's estimate the total time spent killing and waiting for bosses to be around 1 minute . <p> So we have 2.5 minutes of travel time , or 150 seconds . <p> Adding 50% movespeed means you are going 1.5 times as fast , so your new travel time will take 66.7% ( 1/1.5 ) of your original travel time . Thus , <p> The original clear time was 3.5 minutes ( or 210 seconds ) and the new clear time is 50 seconds faster ( 160 seconds ) . So the improvement can be seen as <p> 180/230 = .783 or 78.3% of the original time . <p> While this is n't exact or a perfect example by any means , you can see the basic idea . Once you kill bosses under a certain amount of time , it becomes very beneficial for overall clear times to start stacking up movespeed . <p> As a general rule , I would suggest aiming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you find it hard to reach this , an easy way is to swap out your eidolon emblem and top trophy slot to movespeed emblem and noripan trophy when running to bosses . Having them hotkeyed makes this a lot easier , and becomes mechanical after a while . -My edit : If you have trouble surviving , go for a other core than inperial . A dead DPS=No DMG . <p> Note This guide is PvE based , Pvp is simple : wear purple armors+weapons and get at least 50% accuracy to deal with EVA builds . If any questions are left I will do my best to answer them .

There are already a lot of different kinds of transformation tools and I do n't see why they should n't stack to 100 , especially with how many you can get from salvaging gear from fishing/king fish . <p> Tab <p> 04-14-2014 , 11:47 AM <p> +1 for a crafting revamp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this idea <p> Jico <p> 05-14-2014 , 05:01 AM <p> Although the % result in crafting is really random even if you have a grade E in crafting you can still get a 130% craft , I still support this suggestion . +1 to this . <p> Plutso <p> 05-14-2014 , 09:33 AM <p> +1 to this i spend like 500g to not even get my staff grade up from E &gt;. &gt; its 75% orso <p> Heca <p> 05-14-2014 , 05:26 PM <p> I agree but sadly many of these things usually never comes to past , ( I quit crafting and got lvl 65 yellow instead with the exception of titan ( sucky % ) true story ) . they want people to craft more so they probably wont implement anything of such sort . would be nice tho if they do . the craft is way to random . example http : **25;7236;TOOLONG &lt;--- yeah first time I though this server is crafting =130%auto. was proven wrong hueee <p> The way people make money ( while doing the forging mater for the number 1 prize ) is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more matz to make more to sell more <p> ( 1+ on the bar per crafting progression increase ) <p> obnoxious <p> 05-14-2014 , 05:48 PM <p> that last patch messed up the market , i mean gratz for making the illusion of a lower market prices but what really happening is with this new method low price recipes but high price materials is messed up . there 's a reason why recipes are limited and the materials are cheap . thanks for those players who qq 'd about the recipe prices . now the materials went x10 to it 's original price lol. 50g for a stack of purple gold ore ? no thanks . <p> i believe the players suggested to make these recipes available for everyone but why change the material drop rate ? it 's like okay i 'll grant your wish .. ill give you a brand new arms but i will take your legs . i dun geddit . <p> so now tell me .. what happened to those ppl who claims to be concern with the server economy ? you always harass us " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these kind of problems ? you do n't want to feel aura 's wrath ? ohh i know your kind . lol . <p> +1 well even i feel that way , it 's ridicilous too see the price skyrocketing : / <p> Aura <p> 05-15-2014 , 02:03 AM <p> that last patch messed up the market , i mean gratz for making the illusion of a lower market prices but what really happening is with this new method low price recipes but high price materials is messed up . there 's a reason why recipes are limited and the materials are cheap . thanks for those players who qq 'd about the recipe prices . now the materials went x10 to it 's original price lol. 50g for a stack of purple gold ore ? no thanks . <p> i believe the players suggested to make these recipes available for everyone but why change the material drop rate ? it 's like okay i 'll grant your wish .. ill give you a brand new arms but i will take your legs . i dun geddit . <p> so now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be concern with the server economy ? you always harass us " becoz were destroying the economy " but did n't mention these kind of problems ? you do n't want to feel aura 's wrath ? ohh i know your kind . lol . <p> I think you do n't have your facts completely straight . First of all , there are no custom rates regarding neither the drop rate for recipes or for materials . Although we do have a x2 custom drop in items , the reason of the change in the drop rate is related to the fact that we changed the server version . Before , the server was stated as in the NA version of the game , in which materials had a high drop rate but recipes we 're almost impossible to get . After the tachi class , since most of the features were changed on how the TW version is designed , the relationship end up been basically the inverse . <p> There is also another factor to take in consideration , and its how the higher drop rate of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Those are simple maths , the more recipes people gets the more items they make , therefor material becomes more rare . Plus , crafted gear has become a more popular problem for the single fact more people is actually crafting . Before , and due to the amount of recipes obtain and in the market , most people did n't dream to recraft an item for an attempt of a bigger bonus , another situation that have changed . One month ago only , people was clearly under-equipped and players have difficulties even to get at the 10th floor of SkyTower ( other situation that have also progress a lot ) . <p> On my personal opinion , I still believe its better to have a higher drop rate on recipes than on material themselves . Because although there is a limited amount of places where you can actually get the recipes you need , materials can be farmed at different places and at different levels , giving everyone the possibility to have an income . Regardless , I do have observed how the prices of materials and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the community lately . I think it would be wise to address this issue but with enough precaution . Something you certainly do n't want to see it 's crafted gears with extra bonus rates become TOO easy , that has the potential to kill both the economy and the game itself . <p> Genny <p> 05-15-2014 , 12:43 PM <p> The materials drop rate is fine the way it is currently and you will only run into trouble if you were trying to buy from the AH . You can go blame the people who used fishbot gold to climb the forging ranking board . <p> Heca <p> 05-15-2014 , 02:15 PM <p> I already know how to solve this problem for me im already working on it hah , took me a bit <p> Aidos <p> 05-15-2014 , 02:49 PM <p> I do like the idea on increasing the faster grade level however I disagree with the stated opinion about the market being messed up , I think Aura explained it perfectly , referring to the correlation between " what 's in demand " , more recipes = more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> 05-15-2014 , 03:52 PM <p> well I think we can grind dungeons to get the mats if we do n't  wan na buy OP priced ones . less people grinding for the items , the higher their price becomes , yet there are already a lot of people who has lvl 60 mats , but only a few find enuf time to grind for the needed mats . Maybe most people are getting more occupied about other things in game than actually grinding for mats they need for crafting . Just my opinion . I see people camping for WB , people grinding for LP , people fishing . I think setting priorities would help . If you wan na focus crafting , then you have to grind the dungeons for the mats . If everything is served to us on a silver platter , then things would be too easy for this game . <p> Still , the idea about the rate of how the crafting grade increases faster is a good idea , but not gon na complain if it is n't implemented .

@@23370383 @3370383/ <p> Gunslinger is a DPS class that shoots away your enemy with high burst damage from a distance ( Well , of course. ) , but unlike other classes , our skills have much much faster cooldown , and the animation of the skills are faster too , and prefer kiting . <p> Why choose Gunslinger ? Nope , I wo n't say anything like " it 's an easy and a beginner friendly class ! " . Yep , absolutely not . But I can say that , it 's fun to play and it 's challenging to play as one too . If you 're not a fan of luring or killing a school of mobs , then this class is suited for you . That 's it . Boring right ? <p> http : **39;7263;TOOLONG - Splash Damage skill . This one shoots your enemy with a barrage of bullets , hitting it and the enemies around it . If ever you have lured a little few mobs , this will be your friend . <p> LONG ...

Frost Trap - Immobilizes any enemy who steps on it , taking Damage per second and increasing their critical hits received . <p> http : **28;7304;TOOLONG Dark Flare Trap - Dealing continuous damage to any enemy who 're in its range , reducing their received healing . <p> LONG ... Decoy - Charms an enemy ( monsters only ) around a certain level , making them your ally for a few seconds . <p> LONG ... Mental Focus - Increases SPD of you and your party members . <p> Stat Point Allocation And Gears(70+) <p> Before anything else , I bet some people will think " Oh , it 's a long range DPS , an Eva-type build is great " because of the 5% passive eva on envoy . But it 's not the case anymore ! Get as much Eva as you want , and you still wo n't be able to dodge that much on bosses especially in sky tower ! So in this guide , we 're gon na focus on how to maximize our Defense and HP @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ using green gears is enough to survive given that you can allocate your stat points to your needs until level 60 . And by the time you hit level 60 , you might be tempted to use Devourer set as it has a good stats , which is Crit/Hp/Eva . Which is I wo n't forbid you too , besides , I would suggest to use the set while you 're at it , but the top ones only , because of the +set effect . Then use Revelation Set on your bottoms . <p> These will be your accessories until you get the preferred level 65 accessories , which you will see below . If you find it hard to craft or buy it , you can settle for the Comets accessories , they 're cheap and has good stats too . <p> The reason I picked this set over Lethal beast is that , one thing is the HP stat . Well , we 're focusing on Def HP again , and using Lethal Beast is a great loss of HP , but in exchange for DPS . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it was my first set to be honest . But it was back when I was using Uzuriel as my Eidolon , but I sucked at PvP . Because my DMG was a little low and cruel rush rarely procs on players . <p> Suggested Envoy Path at 75 . I took two ultimates for dire situations . ( LOL ) <p> Red , Yellow and Orange Colors are top priority in getting first at early levels . The two ultimates and the aimed shot mastery is up to you if you will take it or leave it . They 're open for changes , for you : ) <p> This is the best pistol you can see in the game as main hand IMO . I wo n't recommend the 75 gun unless you 5-star it .

XD <p> First , I still prefer Lethal Beast over Lion 's Roar , reasons being Gunslingers have fast enough cooldown to spam their skill rotations to proc food , Orange Zeal , Discerning Attack envoy and Cruel Rush , Gunslingers can deal tons of damage to a single target . It 's also easier to cap CRIT DMG as compared to just increasing CRIT , since Lethal Beast gives flat +11% CRIT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good for lower budgeted players because of the HP stat , but reaching 90k HP as a Gunslinger with Katar sub can be reached with two Thunderous secret stones and Float . <p> For the trophies , I agree that Teda 's is a really good choice for gunslingers . Toto 's Shard is still decent , but I recommend replacing it with Nirvana if you have the budget or DC to buy it . Taking Otto 's into account , Yarnaros , as well as pumping a lot of DMG points , the DMG to HP conversion is pretty huge in terms of our survivability . <p> Lastly , for Tactical Spec , since everyone seems to be using Organized Sabotage and Break Defense , I think that Orange Crippling mastery is best . It synergizes well with Gunslingers because along with Aimed Shot , it becomes much easier to kite . <p> Nice guide by the way .

Both set are good anyways depending on what Eidolon you will use . Like when I used Lethal Beast + Uzuriel Eidolon . But at most , I can only have around 60k HP in PvP , since I use one Zephyr stone . Getting Crit DMG cap is easy with Uzuriel Eidolon but with Yarnaros , it 's impossible . The Cruel Rush is good , especially in PvE , but it can be used rarely in PvP 's . <p> I have the DC for Nirvana but since I have 78k-80k HP in PvE 's , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) I rarely play anyways . Still doing tests on how far the Crit DMG of Gunslingers will go with Lion 's Roar set + Yarnaros Eidolon then I 'll decide if Toto is worth replacing for Nirvana in PvP 's . <p> Anyways , Your tip is great . : ) <p> Eraviel <p> 09-27-2014 , 12:52 AM <p> -removed as guide is updated- <p> PowPow <p> 09-28-2014 , 08:02 AM <p> Nice stats : ) <p> Eraviel <p> 10-08-2014 , 08:23 AM <p> -removed as guide is updated- <p> Sera <p> 10-09-2014 , 08:29 AM <p> No boss damage other than sub weapon ?

Actually what food and drink buff suit well for gunslinger ? <p> I 'm using Sniper Set right now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For food , I use The Bak Kut drink ( +HP , +DEF , -CRIT DMG Taken ) and Chicken Cake Food ( +Def , +Eva , -DMG Taken ) , as using the new foods like +CRIT/+DMG , +SPD , Move SPD does n't help me as you see in the SS I 've posted , I got 60%+ Crit , 30% SPD with my Buffs ( I think around 18% without it ) and 135% Move SPD without taking any Move SPD on envoy path . <p> Actually , the drinks and foods depends on your play style . You can use the Double/Triple DMG foods if you want to but basing on my experience , I do not recommend it . While yes , Gunslinger 's skill rotation is very fast , suitable for those procs , but since we do Jump Casts as what other Long-Ranged DPS classes ( If you 're not doing it , well ... ) the food mostly procs on the normal attacks . So using that 5% chance food does n't really help much , but the 10% is a different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Foods and Drinks is so that I could put all my def points to HP . Having 82k - 84k HP while the set does n't give HP is really great , judging how Gunslingers have lower base HP . I 'm not lowering my HP below 80k because it 's pretty dangerous . <p> Eraviel <p> 11-29-2014 , 01:15 PM <p> Guide updated as of the current content .

But if I were to pick in the choices , I 'd go for Brawler . Duelist is kinda good as a Tanky-DPS , same with Brawler . <p> Kure <p> 11-28-2014 , 04:51 AM <p> First , are you after an assassin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ton of dps ? If it 's an assassin class feeling I 'd recommend brawler due to the weapon appearance and the gameplay . Blitz , the stun dash , is very assassin like and lotus strike gives brawler probably the largest non ultimate burst in the game . Though it 's not as good as other classes at keeping a steady stream of damage , the whole idea of burst is very " assassin " like . <p> As for tons of damage , it somewhat depends as the biggest factor to your dps is your gear . My advice if you 're new is to first find the class you think you 'll like , then learn to make it hit hard . <p> Aidos <p> 11-28-2014 , 04:56 AM <p> Katar does seem to suit the " assassin " theme but really if you 're looking for a hella high burst class definitely Ravager . However since you mentioned you also want a Eva build then probably your best option wold be katar since it 's pretty easy to build evasion on it . <p> Kure <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never played ravager .

The problem is that Brawler 's damage output can be a bit low since they have a built-in tankiness to them ( like Myanya said ) . Just play whatever fits your style . <p> Just curious as I 've never played ravager . Just not a fan of axes I guess . What makes it " bursty ? " From what I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ class , especially before the nerf to rage bar . Once we get class specialization paths the fireball skill is supposedly gon na be pretty strong . Or do you just mean it hits like a truck in general ? I think it 's because of how RnR works that players consider it burst . RnR has 10 separate hits and each one can still proc Zeal + nocturnal . Before the nerf , it was even crazier because TF4 's extra damage made it 20 chances to proc Zeal + Nocturnal in 1 cast . All that damage flying so fast . It 's just guesses since I do n't play Ravager either . Majority went Fire weapon for Flame Slash 's path but then I heard that TW nerfed Ravagers again a while after . <p> Kure <p> 11-28-2014 , 08:30 AM <p> Thanks Esper . Figured that was the case .

Rav is just " too bursty " before the nerf arrive , especially when using Lv 70 weapons . <p> As for assassin themed class , it 's either duelist or brawler , but if you want bursty Brawler would be the choice . Then again , if you just want high damage , go for Rav or wait for Greatsword to be release . <p> Shiohara <p> 11-28-2014 , 05:48 PM <p> I will just say this TrickerXz15 , if you only focus on your skill damage you will be crippling your potential DPS output like the majority of the players in-game , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then you can tell me if you can find a Ronin in-game that can outdps you . <p> I have n't seen many good Ronins in-game , the best I 've seen is Myanya 's and last time we checked both his boss damage was lower ( He was using bard sub without the proper sub weapon for PvE and I am just assuming he was focusing on PvP which would explain that ) and his speed stat was not at the desirable level to get maximum DPS output . It would 've been fun to see whose DPS output would be higher with the latest update . <p> Ronins main benefit in PvE is this , they have high base damage on their weapons meanwhile Brawlers get a 34% damage boost in total when they are in combat ( when your buffs are all stacked up , does n't take long to get them going but it takes time ) . <p> In my opinion you should go Ronin/Brawler , fun combination and you 'll still get to use all the assassin like skills from Brawlers rooster but Ronins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one last tip , EVA is a luxury stat please do everyone a favor and do n't build EVA when you have pitiful defense and hp . <p> Shibi <p> 11-29-2014 , 11:21 AM <p> I 'd suggest Brawler since it 's the class that 's very close to an " assassin " that deals great dps . Semi-comparible to Ravager ( The god class ) . <p> Mind you , it 's difficult to build eva without sacrificing too much dmg . So choose one . Either to deal tons of dmg , or deal mediocre dmg in exchange to have eva . <p> Another suggestion tho , I 'd suggest just to build full dd since this game does n't really need too much survivability . EVA is just a luxurious stat like Shio stated . <p> Kure <p> 12-01-2014 , 06:10 PM <p> I would somewhat disagree on evade being a luxury stat in brawler 's case , simply because the class makes better use of evade and gets it easier than any other class . It 's still a choice between going straight up dps and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the free 10% evade from water rune makes it a good deal easier to build . Also , at least at lvl 60 , you 'll make great use of devourer set and murfeo acc set . It 's even a good deal cheaper since you will likely use the ruth 's fragrance accessory set at 65 instead of the exorbitantly priced flokja set . Then again , I use brawler/guard so I 'm a bit more defense focussed to begin with . <p> Shibi <p> 12-01-2014 , 06:48 PM <p> I would somewhat disagree on evade being a luxury stat in brawler 's case , simply because the class makes better use of evade and gets it easier than any other class .

Also , at least at lvl 60 , you 'll make great use of devourer set and murfeo acc set . It 's even a good deal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accessory set at 65 instead of the exorbitantly priced flokja set . Then again , I use brawler/guard so I 'm a bit more defense focussed to begin with . <p> I 've been in love about mixing defensive stats in this game , til I realized that we can survive Sky Tower 1-25 with 70k hp lol . <p> Survivability in this game means nocturnal core , and having a lot of dps to compliment the pace of this game in pve . <p> Point is that this game does n't really need " tankiness " . It 's too fast paced and building tanky will only slow your pace down . PvE perspective . <p> Although I ca n't speak for myself ... I still did n't give up on EVA even with full dps set lel . ( Semi-Full Combat stats with bard dmg ballad . 95% eva with bard/sorc ulti ) ( http : **29;7518;TOOLONG ) <p> Myanya <p> 12-01-2014 , 08:35 PM <p> You can be tanky without sacrificing any dps , if built right and have a lot of funds . <p> NoxIgnis <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Having 95% eva with 0 point allocated is very easy to reach in this content , ofc without losing too much dps. ( as a brawler .. ) <p> Raimoo <p> 12-02-2014 , 02:35 AM <p> You can be tanky without sacrificing any dps , if built right and have a lot of funds . <p> True . you just need to add some oil on your brain to think properly . If you always run on low funds , you 'll never be able to make a proper DPS tank . This is why EVA is a luxury stat despite certain classes have huge advantage on it . 
@@23370391 @3370391/ <p> So I 've been playing my PvE brawler/ravager for a while now and one thing I noticed is that there are n't any brawlers at all . Sure , I 've seen maybe one or two , but could someone tell me why there are n't any ? I was also considering just moving over to a ravager instead , since I heard it was much better to do . I do n't mind playing ravager or even my necromancer that I have right now but I do n't know which one to do ... Thanks and cheers . <p> Esper <p> 09-19-2014 , 05:27 AM <p> I think we have a decent amount of Katar players . I just mostly see them in Cent/Arena though . Ravager will always have the bigger population because of Rage bar and their huge damage . Ca n't compare anything to that . <p> Raimoo <p> 09-19-2014 , 05:36 AM <p> I 'm a Katar myself o.o Yeah we have a decent amount of Katar players anyways .

@@23370392 @3370392/ <p> Server Maintenance and other News . Hello envoys ! We will be doing our weekly maintenance this Thursday , July 24th instead of our usual schedule . The maintenance will take place between 20 and 21 hours server time , and it 's duration will be of aprox. 1 hour as usual . The reason behind the delay is the need to fix some current bugs , that we would like to include in this week patch . <p> The patch itself will include new items to the client , but it 's mostly targeted to a change on our Paragon Table and new promotions . So in case some of you are wondering , there will be no new content included this week . Although I do n't want to spoil the surprise completely I can share with all of you that we will have two categories ( Heaven and Hell ) in this Paragon with new items , and some old ones that will be bring back . <p> Our AP Store will be also updated with some old promotions , that mostly our new players @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also include the Upgrade Pack , a special bundle of advanced fortification scrolls with an important discount , and chances to get Endora , Shirayuki , Kaiser Zeta and some special backpacks . Both new costumes , Midnight Coat and Serena 's Moonlight Set will be added , but not on the Paragon Table or in a fortune bag as most expected . These new items will be a part of a 2 weeks Loyalty Promotion , in the Costumes Category . <p> On other news ; as some of you may have realized three of our Game Sages are n't a part of our staff anymore ( Ayasel , Aidos and Lokito ) . Contrary of what some people is speculating , they have leave the staff by own choice and did n't had any relationship with their perfomance . We are thankful of everything they 've done so far for us and the community , and we hope they will remain charish and active members of our server but from a new perspective . <p> Of course , the server still needs an active staff to take care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the search of new replacements and they will be announced very soon . <p> Finally , as some of you may have heard rumors about it too , we 're currently working on adding two new maps to the game . These maps are known as " Color Mushroom Forest " and " Green Water Wetlands " , and includes new cities , field maps , instances , gears drops and even level 70 recipes . The maps are still in development state , and we expect to add them very soon . Since the amount of new items and monsters needs more than a pair of eyes to check it , it 's very possible we engage ourselves in a quick closed beta test of the content before it 's official release . <p> With that in mind , we will proceed in similar fashion than we did last time , making an open recruitment for testers and raffling the available slots between the people who is willing to help us try it . We will have more information about it this next Monday , and if everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we will post the recruitment thread . <p> Hope the information have n't been confussing , but feel free to post any doubt you have about it . And once again , thank you all for the given support . <p> Lighttaker <p> 07-23-2014 , 09:29 PM <p> : D nice *first post* <p> Esper <p> 07-23-2014 , 09:31 PM <p> Mhm ...

Although I ca n't give you any ETA when it take place , I 'm hoping it will be between this Thursday and Friday and will have no impact on this weekend activities . As for the reason behind the delay , we 're still looking and working for a solution to the animation related issues on male characters , which is the most crucial matter at the moment . As soon the solution is found the server restart will take place , in order to add the other fixes planned for this week schedule maintenance . <p> On a related but different note , the Paragon Table will STILL change today as promised . Two new Paragon Tables will be added , Music and Magic Editions . Both of them will only be available for 1 week , since next week both Paragons will update once more time with completely different items . As for lst week 's limited promotions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gaia in AP ) they will remain in shop until the maintenance takes place . <p> Please stay tuned for more info , since the maintenance could begin at any non-specific time . Of course we will keep you updated , here and ingame . As for more detailed info , I will include here the future patch notes for the planned maintenance with everything else that will contain : <p> And also , keep in mind our next week maintenance will take place as scheduled , on June 3rd DESPITE of today 's delay . Next week will include several things , like two new Paragon Tables with two new brand costumes , the update of the Bonus Mall with new items , new promotions in both LP and AP store , update of the item mall , and of course the awaited addition of Fenrir 's Key of Gaia in the Adventurer Encyclopedia Rewards as June prize .

@@23370396 @3370396/ <p> I notice that lately almost all DPS are using Yarnaros because of his amazing 3 star 16% DMG buff , on top of that he has 10% stat conversion making him easily the best DPS eidolon . Even worse is Serif who gives 30% HP buff but is unavailable to those who did not choose him at the beginning , which is pretty unfair especially for tanks . <p> The issue here in my opinion is that some eidolons can be 3 stared and others can not . I know that most 3 star evolutions have not been released yet but I was wondering if its possible to allow eidolons to go to 3 star but their appearance not change , allowing everyone to use the eidolon of their choice and not have to sacrifice large amounts of stats . <p> I feel like this is especially important because new and exciting eidolons like Bahamut , Zeta , Shirayuki , Baldur , Hera , etc are n't as appealing because they are not as viable as others , even though people may want to use them instead . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3 star evolution released and it 's very discouraging . <p> With this change I feel like it would allow people more freedom in how they build their character stat wise and appearance wise which would increase quality of life in game . <p> Eidolons are one of the largest features of this game so it makes no sense to me there are so few viable choices , hopefully this can be changed and people can use the eidolon they love instead of the best one at the moment . <p> Tab <p> 05-25-2014 , 05:00 PM <p> This would be nice , but is there anything in the database of the game that could let us know the proper 3-star/4-star bonuses of each eidolon ? Remember that right now , eidolons are showing certain bonuses for 3-star evolutions that are n't the ones we expected from places like www.reyva.com and this does n't mean Reyva has the wrong information , but that the bonuses we have in the server are different due to the custom client itself . <p> So if there 's a change in the 3/4-star bonuses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ merged into the client we use ( like TW , or even French -winks at Aura , saw the screenshots in-game- ) , that could mean there 's 3 possibilities to what those extra bonuses would be ( NA , TW , FR ) . And I 'm only assuming for those last evolutions , since we 've seen the same 1/2-star bonuses in the other versions . <p> If Aura and her team could make this happen , that would be AWESOME ( even though I love Zaahir 's buffs : o ) <p> Plutso <p> 06-03-2014 , 09:52 AM <p> that would be nice : P but i do n't  have the crests anyways to make another eidolon 3 stars xD tsubaki 2 star maxed and my merrilee still 0 star but nearly second star evrything completed expect hp and eva : / <p> Heca <p> 06-03-2014 , 11:14 AM <p> your right until know with the bottom set crit damage and the stone converting to crit damage again , its obvous for me to switch to yanaros. that is until the new set come out and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I switch back to ulzuriel .. but you rright I rather play with yanaros than anyone else ( everything else its just for looks ) until endora 4star comes out than Shidazzel just got real in here <p> Ayasel <p> 06-03-2014 , 11:20 AM <p> I pretty much support this suggestion , however we do n't have 3 star eidolon appearance changes at all ( except those few ) .

Remember that right now , eidolons are showing certain bonuses for 3-star evolutions that are n't the ones we expected from places like www.reyva.com and this does n't mean Reyva has the wrong information , but that the bonuses we have in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> So if there 's a change in the 3/4-star bonuses of eidolons from any of the server versions that were merged into the client we use ( like TW , or even French -winks at Aura , saw the screenshots in-game- ) , that could mean there 's 3 possibilities to what those extra bonuses would be ( NA , TW , FR ) . And I 'm only assuming for those last evolutions , since we 've seen the same 1/2-star bonuses in the other versions . <p> If Aura and her team could make this happen , that would be AWESOME ( even though I love Zaahir 's buffs : o ) <p> This is one of the issues why this suggestion is n't currently possible . Although you have a " preview " on 3 star buffs , it does n't mean those are the actual stats that would be release at all . The other possible issue is regarding the modeling ; changing eidolons appeareance is not something we can commit to do ourselves for the moment . And if you evolve your eidolons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I can not confirm you what will happen with those already evolved eidolons . <p> xion111 <p> 06-03-2014 , 02:36 PM <p> Yarnaros is crap .

@@23370397 @3370397/ <p> Hello , welcome to Aura 's Kingdom ! This is a newly opened private server , and it has been around for a month . Are you new to the server , or are just seeking answers to most of your questions ? Well , lucky you ! In this guide , I will be teaching you the basics of the server , from quests , to gold , to even dancing ! Also , feedback is suggested . If you have any suggestions , improvements , or have found an error in any piece of information in this guide , post it down below , so this guide can be the best as it can be ! <p> Keys 1-8 : Hotkeys . Once an item or skill has been dragged into a hotkey slot in the UI , it can be used/activated with these keys . <p> Ctrl:Holding Ctrl and pressing one of the hotkeys will trigger an item or skill in a different slot .

In this part of the guide , I 'll be showing you various methods in order to increase your levels . Let 's get started ! <p> Quests <p> Quests are the main way that you should level up . You can accept quests by right clicking on an NPC with a question mark above their head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do for a quest . It will either be to kill something , gather something , go somewhere , talk to another NPC , complete a dungeon , or to defeat a mini-boss . You should have enough quests to last you until you get to about level 60ish , because of the 5x EXP , you will be a higher level then normal . <p> Dungeons <p> Farming dungeons is a great way to get EXP if you 're bored and have nothing to do . You usually get a few levels from farming every dungeon in the game . Soloing dungeons gives you the least amount of EXP . Party-mode dungeons gives you a little more EXP . Hell-mode dungeons give you a ton of EXP , as well as better rewards . <p> Grinding <p> Grinding is another method to level up , however it is not recommended , as normal monsters do n't give a lot of EXP . Farming dungeons and doing quests are better options than grinding , and there are tons of other things to do than grind . <p> Dungeons <p> There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you great EXP , tons of gold , as well as some sweet loot ! <p> Alabastren Temple <p> Alabasten temple is the first dungeon available to players , accessible at level 25 . The dungeon entrance is located in Crescent Hill . <p> Candeo Core is an instance in Candeo Marsh , available to players level 48 or above . <p> Bosses <p> Lestaro - Level 50 <p> Toto - Level 51 <p> Asheara - Level 52 <p> Deep 's Cavern <p> Deep 's Cavern is an instance in Triatio Highlands , available to players level 48 or above . <p> Bosses <p> Zaunna - Level 50 <p> Adracei - Level 51 <p> Argus - Level 52 <p> Wrathborne Temple <p> Wrathborne Temple is an instance in Ventos Prairie , available to players level 53 or above . <p> Bosses <p> Kelosa - Level 56 <p> Saint Hale - Level 57 <p> Frederic - Level 58 <p> Ghostweep Cave <p> Ghostweep Cave is an instance in Oblitus Wood , available to players level 53 or above . <p> Bosses <p> Gekasso - Level 55 <p> Malodnak - Level 56 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Looking for a way to earn some gold fast , or want to earn gold slowly , while you 're afking ? Well , this was made especially for you ! <p> Dungeons <p> Again , stated in this guide many times , Dungeons are a great way to get gold . You will earn a number of silver ( sometimes gold ) for each monster you kill . Farming every dungeon can get you tons of gold every day ! <p> Fishing <p> Fishing is a great way to get gold , you can do it manually for better loot , or you can do it afk if you 're going somewhere or sleeping , etc . However , you need to spend money on bait though , so it depends on how lucky you are . Also , if you want a better profit , fish manually , as you can get fish that you can sell for 1 gold , 5 gold , and 50 gold . <p> Selling Items <p> Selling Items is a great way to earn money . Just look for players who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is " Buy Low , Sell Higher ! " <p> Donating <p> Donating is a great way to earn gold , it benefits the server too . However , it costs real life money . But , with AP , you can buy tons of things in the Item Mall that most people are looking for . <p> Guide to the Eidolons <p> Eidolons are partners/pets that aid you in combat . They can do various amounts of things , such as dealing high damage , tanking , healing you , generating malice , etc . They are really useful , in PvE and in PvP . <p> Some of you probably have a lot of questions about the various classes in-game . From the AP Build , to the Envoy Path build , here are a few guides for ever class that will help you along the way . <p> Credits <p> I could n't have made this thread without the help of other people , and other sources . <p> Thanks to http : **38;7699;TOOLONG for the info on dungeons .

A very special date for all the community is getting closer , and with the server 's first anniversary on February 15th , we want to celebrate in the best way we know how : With friends , of course ! This game would n't be the same without the amazing amount of fashion that allows you to customize your character like no other . And since most of us are fashion addicts , we have a slightly different proposal of our usual fashion contests . <p> So what you have to do ? First of all , in order to get this party started , you will actually need a party ! This is a group fashion contest . You will have to team up with -at least- another three players and design the perfect party look . So here 's the other catch ! You need to post one groupal screenshot , and all the members of the party will have to come up with related looks . You can use any type of celebration as inspiration , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In fact , you can use any type of themed-topic , as long as it 's explained on the entry and the looks are cohersive between each other . <p> Only one of the players will post the screenshot , and only one screenshot is allowed by group .

The screenshots can not be edited . <p> You will have time until February 16th to post on this thread LONG ... The most cohersive and original entries will be selected as our winners . Of course , players can only participate once , so you can post only with one group .

After all , and if you think carefully of it , Aura Kingdom 's backstory is mainly a love one . Tragic and painful , it ends up in madness and with the evil attempt to conquer the world ... But are n't all love stories a little bit like that ? <p> The honest true is that , after one year of playing together , we still only know a few about Aura Kingdom 's main characters and Belenus nemesis , Reinhardt . We started the game with merely a nightmare and almost no memories of our past life . In all of this time , we have learned about our very own strength and how dangerous our power can be . But about how everything started ... We barely know anything ! So in order to commemorate our Anniversary , I 'm asking our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have to do ? It 's time to let your imagination fly ! I will ask you to tell us a story of the beginning , far before your first recollection of Azuria . It can be story about Belenus and Reinhardt ; how they dispute started and why it escalated so much . It can be a story about Reinhardt 's younger days in the Templar Knights , his missions , his friendships , how he met Lucfa ... It can be a story of how Lucfa died and what was the mysterious illness that took her from this world . It can be any story you imagine ! <p> You will have time until February 16th to submit or edit your entry , on this section LONG ... Here , you must only add the link to your thread . We will choose the best three entries based on originilaty and creativity as we always do . In addition , you can add chapters , different fonts and colors , to make the story more pleasant .

Our Anniversary would n't be completed without the talent of those people that , will only some footage , takes us to the things we most enjoy of the game . Video events are n't very often on the server , reason why they 're so much special . And what better way to celebrate our birthday , that with a tribute to the game we love . <p> So What You Have To Do ? Basically , you will have to create a trailer for our server , something that captures the spirit of our community . It can involve a story , online chatting , dancing , killing monsters or even -if you are one of those almost extinct species- pvp . It can be emotional or pure action , after all this is also your server and you can choose the best way to portray it . <p> You will also have until February 16th to post or edit your entry , on this thread/COLOR LONG ... There 's no length limit to the video itself , but keep in mind it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ completely up to you , how many people you choose to show , the scenery , music , etc .

So , after one year of having the players best interests at heart , it has come the time for some retribution . <p> So What You Have to Do ? If my hints have n't been clear enough , this is a summoning event . On February 14th ( sorry if you have a date , but if you do , why you play in the first place ? ) several monsters will appear in the world of Azuria . Of course , I will still be equipped with my GM gears , but you 'll soon discover how little they do against constant attacks . And since I 'm just like any other mortal , you will have the special task to protect me . Tanks , bards , melees , rangers ... You will all have to work together to kill the bosses and keep me alive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the event will last , more monsters will be summon and special drops will be achieved . But as soon I die , the event will be over ! <p> Location , time and channel will be given on the same week of the event .

@@23370404 @3370404/ 21183 @qwx221183 <h> Cutscene Freezing <p> I already know that new maps gives a lot of bug and lags .. but i think this is different issue . I got Cutscene Freeze after defeat the second boss in Ancient Rock Tomb . The cutscene before was actually running smooth ( cutscene that second boss appeared ) , but after i defeat it , it always freezing like this ... 4eb7f1a704.jpg sorry , not a video and just screenshot , but i want you to know that the background still running . this happened every time i 'm playing at rock tomb without exception . the freeze can be 5 minutes to 27 minutes . i already talk to other player and they said it was just lagging ( server lag ) . if its lag , i must be ca n't use any skill , but the fact when i press skill in keyboard , the voice of the skill heard . i try to move the character and i think the character is moving ( i du n no either coz of the freezing cutscene , but it moves .. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like damned marsh dungeon ... just this rock tomb . i trying to find out how to skip the freezing cutscene , and i realize i must open browsing and wait it to respond . after it respond , i close browser. ( again and again as long i playing at rock tomb ) . <p> well , it 's okay thou , but i 'm kinda bothered that i must open browser everytime i defeat the second boss in rock tomb . <p> The problem is actually related to the cutscene itself , since the boss can still attack you while the cutscene is on ( and that 's the reason why you freeze too , more than likely ) . If anything , we will try to disable the cutscene completely to avoid the issues , but I will ask for your patience until our next maint. 
@@23370405 @3370405/ <p> As we all know , doing the questline again and again on alts tp unlock locations is a pain . And as we all know , Aura 's stance : <p> To be completely honest , I though about this before launching the server . My original idea was to remove the quest cap for alt characters , meaning once you already completed the quests you could create a new one without re having to do all the story quests . Yet , the idea was more complicated to implement that it seemed , and end up not being possible . I do not agree to remove the quest cap completely , so I don ' t think we will be able to make this one come through . <p> I 'm not going to say I know what Aura can or ca n't do because I have no programming/developing background , but would it be possible to shorten the quest line instead of outright removing it ? <p> My suggestion Requires : Ability to modify/add main quests , ability to make clearing one quest cancel out another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the day ) , ability to add new items <p> I was thinking , after clearing an area 's quests , add a new reward " Medal of Clearing X Location " which can be shared between characters but is untradable . <p> Then , add an optional quest at the start of each location where you can turn in the Medal on an alt , and it will directly lead to the start of the next location 's quests and nullify the main quests of first location . The optional quest also gets nulled when the main quests are cleared normally . <p> So first time players will have that optional quest but be unable to complete it , and when they clear the main quest line normally , they have the medal which can be given to alts . <p> Alts can then choose to use the medal on the optional quest and skip the location . <p> Like I said , this is all theory and I do n't know if it 's possible , if an idea like this has already been thought of but not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Plutso <p> 04-07-2014 , 07:36 AM <p> No .... Just no . I do n't  want even more items taking up my space &gt;. &gt; <p> Zylphe <p> 04-07-2014 , 10:16 AM <p> Extremely easy fix , medals can be made discardable , since skipping on alts is a choice and not forced , discarding just makes the questline unskippable . That is literally the least of my concerns with this idea , I just wonder if it 's actually possible . <p> Plutso <p> 04-07-2014 , 10:35 AM <p> It shouldent be so hard to be honest just add a item at the last qeust of the map and a new qeust that u can accept at any lvl that checks if you have that coin . <p> Its better if they can change the save data and just add a new line for evry map false or true If true you can skip them If false you have n't done the qeusts yet That 's the best way to go i think <p> Vic <p> 04-14-2014 , 10:07 PM <p> just plain grinding from level one to 55 without doing any quests seems boring to me

Remember the following tips to prevent patching issues : <p> - 1 ) The staff remains active in the shoutbox while the maintenance is on . While the server is offline , content is uploaded to the client and sometimes some of those files needs to be review . So wait until you are notified in the shoutbox that you can patch ; that way you 'll save a few headaches. - 2 ) Once is safe to patch , remember you should always run the Launcher as admin to avoid issues . Simple as right click on the launcher and choose " Run as Administrator " . - 3 ) If your connection is slow , make sure you are n't over-demanding it while patching . Make sure to have other **26;8361;TOOLONG closed . - 4 ) Some versions of some antivirus may give you problems while patching ; it 's safer to have both game.bin and Launcher.exe added to both antivirus and firewall exceptions before starting to patch . - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find a corrupted file , do n't despair neither try to reinstall the game yet . In general , any patching problems can be solved with a restructuring of the packages , but sometimes takes more than 1 attempt to do so . So wait until the patching process is over even if you get errors , once is done close it and open it again . If there has been a download error , the patcher itself should re-download those corrupted files . 21186 @qwx221186 <p> 07-24-2014 , 04:22 PM <p> oooooo Serena dress /o/ <p> kimiross89 <p> 07-24-2014 , 04:30 PM <p> gundam wing ! : rolleyes : <p> MomoDeviluke <p> 07-24-2014 , 04:31 PM <p> Nc : ) Serena costume ! <p> Syntelle <p> 07-24-2014 , 04:33 PM <p> Oh my , lav this new paragon already ! ?

@@23370413 @3370413/ <p> Hey everyone , ever since I hit level ( aprox. ) 48 , I have been leveling extremely slow . It has litteraly taken multiple hours of gameplay and story missions to get up to level 52 ( if I had to guess , i 'd probably say 5-6 hours ) . It 's my first character to reach level 50 and I do n't know if this is normal . Thanks guys ! Enderscraller <p> EDIT : Thanks for pointing things out for me . However , for people who said I was complaining about the speed of leveling up ; there is nowhere in my prior statement that complains about the speed of leveling up . I only said that I was leveling slowly and I asked if it was normal . If you got mad at me for complaining , you can excuse yourselves now . Especially you , Wis . <p> Esper <p> 11-10-2014 , 06:16 AM <p> If you did the Story Quest from beginning to end , it would bring you to level 55 . It 's just as you reach the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spread out due to you leveling faster than the quest level ... so yeah , I would say it does slow down a bit but not drastically . It 's due to all that running around they make you do . Once you hit 55 , all you pretty much do is grind dungeons until 60 &gt; do some new Story Quests &gt; grind dungeons to 62/65 &gt; some more new Story Quests &gt; grind dungeons until 80 . <p> Just wait until you hit 70+ where grinding goes a lot slower if you do n't spend your whole online time grinding Solo/Party/Hell ( assuming you wanted to hit 80 fast ) . <p> Wis <p> 11-10-2014 , 06:25 AM <p> Multiple hours of gameplay for multiple levels is " extremely slow ? " AK may be a casual game , but how can you complain about leveling when the server is on 5x XP ? <p> If you 're bitching about it now , wait until you get to 79 and dungeons give you .09-.13% without other XP modifiers . <p> Myanya <p> 11-10-2014 , 07:24 AM <p> For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 71-75 is harder ( a lot of people make new char at this point ) and 76-80 is hellishly hard . <p> If you are new , you might not know how to level up efficiently . Basically keep doing those dungeon solos and you will level up in no time . But assuming you do all quests chain , it should stop around lvl 57 ( approx. ) and you need to level to 60 through dungeon , which is harder than 60-65 for some reason . <p> Slust <p> 11-10-2014 , 07:50 AM <p> Hey everyone , ever since I hit level ( aprox. ) 48 , I have been leveling extremely slow .

Leveling here is so dam easy that i can level up to Lv 60 in just one week or so ( if play casually ) . Compare to OS where after you 'll done all the quest , you 'll have a hard time leveling up from Lv 55 onwards . <p> Juniper <p> 11-10-2014 , 04:06 PM <p> I just leveled my new bow main to 55 on the OS. 54-55 was a pain in the ass . I already have a 61 character but that 's because I was in a guild that did dungeons on the daily . Bow main @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my skills go off after 3 seconds . Only reason it was easier was because I was using the bronze login gift box XP cards the whole time . If I did n't , I 'd be stuck leveling 49+ through dungeons to finish a level out after main story line for that area . They know I have delay and even more so when their skills go off but they offered to let me sit at the entrance because you still get exp . I do n't like leeching though but solo with +20% XP cards is n't much help either . It is slow as fk . <p> Are you sure you 're not playing aeria and then coming here to remark on it ? It is hella easy to level here . I 'm stuck in Cactakara until my brother does my cut scene robo fight for me . I 'm still leveling and I 'm trying not to ( I see a rare elite I will kill it ) .

Enderscraller on lvl 55 Less , the only thing that slow u down , or speed u up , are the main quest lines , and how fast u finish them , since is the way you get to 55 , it it took u that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you said ) you should be doing main lines extremly down ........... But if u just gave random time , and u said it slowed down compared when you was 20-30 then yes , is much slower since now you 're hight level .... Just take our advice and Do quest lines , once you finish them all ( use to be at lvl 55 if u do nothing else than them ) meaning ventos , oblitus &amp; Desert , you should start spaming solo and solo challenge DNG lvl 55 <p> Kure <p> 11-11-2014 , 01:15 AM <p> @Juniper : A tip for the robot quest . I do n't know about OS , but you can auto attack in it . Took me 2 hits last time to get the kill and just had to get one click on the enemy . <p> aeee98 <p> 11-11-2014 , 05:18 AM <p> I think it is just how slow you take to do quests and dungeons . It seems a little longer , but inexperienced people wo n't be able to hit level 60 in 3 days flat ( It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Aeria 's server ) <p> My guess is your speed in clearing quests are considerably slow ( try using tab + cast to clear mobs much faster ) , and you are n't really experienced in dungeon grinding and quest skipping . This is in fact normal . Or maybe you are just a little more tired . <p> For experience-wise , I have gotten a character in the official server to 69 before and 2 other characters to 60 . Speed leveling is n't a problem even without spending AP . But my first character took me 2 months of gameplay to hit 60 . This is how much experience can change the pace of the game . 
@@23370414 @3370414/ 21183 @qwx221183 <h> Adventure Encyclopedia Eidolon Exchange System Suggestion <p> Well , before i point out why this system will never be used or should n't be used , I 'd like to hope you were not the one that did the math for this system Aura . <p> Anyways , the idea of this exchange system was created because a lot of old players have the keys just sitting around with no use since they are not tradeable . I personally like this system myself because I have a lot of Shirayuki keys . <p> Now , let 's look at the system example for one of the rare keys . <p> Serena : To get one key , you need to have 3 Endora full keys , not frags + 95k DC . The idea to have 95k DC is good and its not really an endless amount since its farmable , but why 3 full keys of other rare eidolons ? <p> Calculation : Let 's just say my goal is to get Serena ( i already got her ready for 3-star if you 're wondering ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needed , and to get to 3 Endora keys , 9 Vermilion keys are needed , AND to get to 9 Vermilion keys , total of 27 Tsubaki keys are needed which turn out to be 135k LP are needed ( if we ignore the time limit of buying it lol ) <p> Conclusion : If a new player looking to get a key that they need through DC system , this is just plain bad . No , do n't tell him/her to go buy the " Harem " bag because its honestly a rip-off to get what you want ( my luck sucks i know ) <p> Suggestion : Keep the system as it is , but lower the amount of keys to " one " instead of " three " full keys . Reason is if they get the key they do n't want or not needed right now , they can just use that key for another key while farming for that 95k DC . <p> Summary : One rare key + 95k DC for another rare key . This is not just for me who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ except Athena but it will work out for everyone including old players .

It does n't makes much sense with your speed to have any lag spikes ; and considering other people doens't seems to have the same problem we should assume the problem is on your side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - Someone 's using your wireless without permission . 2 - Do you have any other PC 's in your house ? Make sure no one is downloading anything , and in case you use torrents , make sure it 's always close and not running in the background . 3 - Check out your antivirus and firewall options , make sure the client is on your antivirus exceptions . Although it has nothing to do , there is a possibility the " lag spikes " are actually game freezes . Which could be , basically , because of an unusual activity of your antivirus trying to block the game because it does n't acknowledge the manufacturer . 4 - Try a game booster , like battle ping . You can use the trial version , which is free , to see if you notice any difference . <p> blynk <p> 04-27-2014 , 10:26 PM <p> Anyone know how to fix this problem ? I 'm having the exact problem .

@@23370417 @3370417/ <p> Heyo , picking up the game , been playing Ronin for a bit , and I 've been looking over the skills and I realized that a lot of Ronin skills have extreme defensive properties to them if you want them to , and I was wondering how viable it would be to make a Ronin Tank ? <p> What Sub weapon would I be picking up at 40 ? Guardian because I 'd be tanking ? Bard for the heals and utility and , awesome ? Something else ? <p> Would I have to develop my masteries and level up stats for it to be entirely viable , or would I still be able to hold my own without entirely focusing on bulk ? Could I be a dodge tank or would I need HP/Def ? <p> Aidos <p> 11-05-2014 , 03:58 AM <p> Well any class can be built as a tank , Tachi included but it depends what you 're looking for cause if you go pure tank you 'll lose a lot of DPS and imo. it would still be weaker then a guardian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the heals , guardian sub has insane long cooldowns though it is still viable I think bard sub is overall better . <p> Also are you building for pvp or pve ? <p> Zsword <p> 11-05-2014 , 04:06 AM <p> Pure PvE , unless PvP has an item that 's good for PvE ( Which it almost never should ) I have no reason to touch PvP . <p> Myanya <p> 11-05-2014 , 04:29 AM <p> Yes and no . <p> My definition of a tank is someone who can keep aggro while surviving . <p> The thing is , if you wear full tank armor you wo n't be able to keep aggro unless the dps in your team really sucks . Of course you 'd have high hp and defense and stuffs , but your dmg will be low . My ronin can reach 170k hp ( no serif ) in full tank set , but all it is good for is surviving some bosses like leanne/tavana/bahamut 2nd form . The most reliable option for tank is still Guardian main , with balanced offense and defense . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Ronin/Tachi skillsets , Tachi is better suitable being mobile rather than tanking , means that you 'd be able to jump in-and-out of battle easier than a Ravager , for example <p> Shibi <p> 11-05-2014 , 05:18 AM <p> It is possible to be an off-tank with any classes . <p> I 'm an off-tank brawler myself and I 'm wearing full dps set ( I fail from time to time but that 's because my weapon is n't +20 yet ) . <p> How to keep the aggro ? <p> -ALWAYS be the first hit and first one to deal the most dmg to the target/boss. -ALWAYS be in the front lines . -Be a man ! <p> Maybe taking Guardian as your subclass and using the skill " Shield Bash " in your rotation would probably help .

That eidolon is very resembles Amaterasu , judging by her clouds , gems her pose . Just for reference I will leave some screenies with her to compare ( screenies of her front and back ) Tho ofc dat 's just my and Pump 's theories .

But there is also another christmas related tradition than some may find uncommon . <p> It 's more than a popular gift , but a forced one , than the older women in the family gives as a present a pair of newly pink panties to other generation of females -the younger ones- . The tradition starts at a very young age ; and I can remember this particular gift with my name on it since I was at least 7-8 years old . <p> So where does this comes from ? Some believe because pink is the color of romance and a sign of fertility ; therefor the new panties are gifted to the single girls on the family as a luck charm to get a suitable partner . Other theories are based on the importance of pink color in Christianity : since pink is a mixture of red ( the color used to designate the Devil ) and white ( the color of God ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christmas is a day of re-birth ; reason why the newly panties ( that must be weared on Christmas Day ) are a symbol of cleanse . <p> Reasons aside -since this is really old tradition- it seems to have survived the effects of time , I can never spend one Christmas without this particular gift from an old aunt . Funny enough than the Santa 's outfit is n't the exception : a pink laced panties with the draw of a mistletoe complete the dress .

First of all , yes , all the cash shop items are available for sale . We have a total of three online stores , in addition to the Paragon Tables . The Paragon Tables are renewed every 7 or 14 days , depending the edition . We often recycle items to the Paragon Table , and newer items are generally first release there besides some exceptions . Items that are n't found in the Paragon Table on a particular date can be found in the Item Mall , with the exception of a few items . Of course , the Paragon Table works as a gambling feature I 'm sure you 're already familiar with . Then we have the AP Store , listed first in the Item Mall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with AP . You 'll find several categories , from fashion items to consumables and upgrading items . The second tab is the Bonus Mall . The Bonus Mall works similar to the tier spender feature in Aeria , with the difference we do not demand a donation in order to make it work ( you can obtain Bonus Points even from the AP you get by login ) . So how to get Bonus Points ? Basically , you get 1 Bonus Point each time you spend 10 AP in the Item Mall . Bonus Mall Items are renewed in monthly basis . In general therms , the items are added there permanently , althought we do about 2 Item Mall Renewal a year in which some of the Bonus Mall items can get changed . The third tab is the Loyalty Store . In the loyalty Store you 'll find everything that can be purchase with Loyalty Points , which you get by leveling/killing monsters/cleaning dungeons or participate in the different game events . Both AP and LP store gets limited promotions from time to time , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Fashion &gt; For Limited Time Only category . Those promotions and durations are always announced at maintenance threads . As for the Dressing Room , it broadcast all the items available in the Item Mall , in the three categories ( AP , BP and LP ) . So if you find an item you like in the Dressing Room , you can then look for it around the Mall . As for eidolons , there are several ways to obtain them . Newer eidolons are generally release in the Paragon Table or in the Adventurer Encyclopedia Rewards ( which you also complete by leveling ) . You can purchase different key of gaia promotions in the Bonus Mall . There are also special fortune bags in the Fortune Bag category of the AP store and the LP store .

It 's just annoyance now because bots are n't as present anymore but remember Aura did n't created the game itself ( otherwise they had a faster and easier time dealing the bugs we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hardcore gamers ; average gamers need to stop by and sell off their boxes and every merchant npc you can sell to , can also fix your gear . <p> ST I can understand because of the length and duration of dungeon itself and the size of the parties . Other instances are n't as much because they 're smaller and yes , there are grocer cards already from the new Production npcs , the gatherer in fact is the easiest to obtain . To be extra cautious , have a back up weapon , even a level 1 would suffice ( and actually has more purpose than you think once you are in a guild ) if only to get yourself out of a bind . Note also that only the durability of the primary weapon is first damaged despite the fact you also use secondary weapons at times .

The reset times are " almost " the same . The reset times for dungeons are half of the time than official ; so for example : <p> - Alabastern Temple attemps resets every hour instead of two , same for similar dungeons as Glyndae. - Temple of Eidolon resets every 3 hours instead of six . At the end , you basically get the double attempts at each dungeon every day ( I 'm not sure if this is what you are asking ) .

@@23370440 @3370440/ <p> Ravagers are known for their take-no-prisoners philosophy . They swing their gigantic axes in arcs so broad , and with impacts so powerful , that many of their strikes damage not only the target but surrounding foes as well . In short they wreck havoc . : cool : Party Role : AOE Damage Dealer . <p> Choosing a subclass for ravagers is quite easy , we just need a decent Range stun and gap closing skills to compensate being a melee , and Ravager party buffs sucks balls , I personally recommend either of these two , Wizard or Brawler . <p> For Starters , put all your Offense Stat on Crit , Defensive Stat on Defense . Ravagers have High Crit Damage so pumping up crit is a good choice . Once u get good gears you can easily reset and put everything on damage / speed ( costs 25g on lvl 69 ) . <p> Damage : Good choice if you have good gears . Crit : Basic Stat , good choice for starters since ravagers have high crit damage . Speed : I personally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cooldown reduction , but it decreased my Damage by 20k , this is recommended for Having Godlike Gear ( +20 Gears ) since Soaring Slash will have a 3 sec CD ( OP ! ) and Round and round having 2 sec CD ( Nerf Please ! ) . <p> Why Extreme Speed over Ironwall/Vigor ? Ironwall is a good choice since we get additional crit based on our defense , it is recommended to use Ironwall at first until you get good gears , switch to Extreme Speed for faster Dungeons clears ( Solos ) and avoiding red carpets ( Party/Hell ) , and chasing players in PVP . <p> You overlooked one of the deadliest rav envoy passive : The deal bonus damage when hitting target below 25% hp ( Finishing Blow ) . This raises your damage considerably , give it a try ( maybe strip one of the max hp above armor of thorn which you can re-add at lvl 72 . Also armor of thorns by itself is mainly useful for pve. the 5% conversion to critical rate is n't as impressive as it seems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ higher ) , it only grants 750 critical rate . My suggestion is just to ditch the right part completely and focus on the left/upper left part for more damage .

@@23370443 @3370443/ <p> As it stands , Vulture Vale and Blizzard Berg missions are mind-numbing , and both maps lean on the side of " empty " , save for the fishing scene . On top of this , any rewards that might require the medals are pretty much not worth the extended effort . <p> My suggestion is to add the Medals to the drop lists of enemies ; Vulture Vale enemies drop Vulture Vale Medals , and Blizzard Berg enemies drop Blizzard Berg Medals . The drop rate does n't have to be crazy high , either , but considering the current loot list for these monsters is " absolutely nothing " , making it possible for players to get their hands on Medal-required prizes in the Encyclopedia a bit sooner than WEEKS of repetitive quest grinding might help players not feel like those rewards are either not worth the effort , or too far off to start collecting for . <p> I ca n't see a change like this disrupting the game 's economy , either , as everything 's bound when it comes from the Encyclopedia . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Vulture Vale/Blizzard Berg Medal prizes to pursue those goals . <p> mihoneko <p> 04-12-2015 , 05:03 AM <p> one sentence : u r lazy bum : ) <p> Wis <p> 04-12-2015 , 05:28 AM <p> Pretty much <p> If the rewards are n't worth your time and effort , do n't do the dailies .

It 's not like you need orange Best Defense to cap nowadays , if that was your goal . <p> Pretty much my opinion . If the rewards are n't worthy , there 's no need to add them in the first place as a special drop . The dailies are actually really fast to finish , so it mainly depends if you 're interested on the rewards or not . <p> CELESTI <p> 04-12-2015 , 02:20 PM <p> I guess it will be something I do when I 'm literally out of things to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was looking more at Gram than anything else . Maybe it 's just me , but those repeatable missions are just the right amount of tedious and uninteresting that I would n't want to do them for 30-60 days , in a row or otherwise . <p> And I 'm not sure how my suggestion makes me a lazy bum , since it would essentially require even more effort just to get more medals a day , and not less , but what do I know , I just got here , right . <p> Sera <p> 04-12-2015 , 02:53 PM <p> Enemies are way easier to farm than those quests , that is all . <p> Myanya <p> 04-12-2015 , 04:01 PM <p> Lazy bum . If you are highly efficient and has good amount of mspd , it is possible to clear all VV quests in 15-20 minutes . You usually get 5-6 per day ( very unlikely to get 8 or more , 7 is lucky enough ) . So it takes about 10-12x questing . Assuming best case scenario it 's 150 minutes time invested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretty good bargain for something that you probably need since some masteries are just too good not to orange . <p> Part of a good mmo is making things not too easy but not too hard , I feel it 's just right in this case . <p> aika <p> 04-12-2015 , 04:48 PM <p> Though I agree with some ( almost all ) statements from responds found on this thread - but " Lazy bum " ? Is that really necessary ? It can be used , yes , but for a much more favorable nature , not this . This is just a suggestion thread , you read and you decide to agree or not , needlessly should you act so tense about it . Way to show a proper netiquette in a community . <p> Since Aura already dropped the bomb on this , any further discussion is entirely hypothetical , but I think the focus of this suggestion got sidetracked by the whole " medal inflation " business . I 'm not trying to get all the scrublords to orange masteries in three days or less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be in Vulture 's Vale and Blizzard Berg , beyond the daily missions . As far as I can tell , these are the only maps in the game where nothing drops from enemies . Compare to running a dungeon ; each dungeon , whether you blast through it with ease or have to take it fight-by-fight , is engaging and rewarding content . You fight a lot of stuff , you get rewarded for doing so . Even the normal maps have this going for them , but not Vulture 's Vale or Blizzard Berg . They 've got a whole lot of enemies ... and that 's it , really . <p> Suggesting that they drop Medals was just a simple method to put some kind of return on being in these maps , beyond the quests . It 's been made pretty apparent that that 's a bit too heavy-handed . I 'd still argue that the principle is n't flawed ; giving the enemies here some kind of drop would make being in these maps feel less like a total waste of time ( if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really worry about being " highly efficient " and stack movement speed to clear the dailies and immediately leave ? ) . Some other suggestions might be Eidolon crests/experience crystals , which are n't super easy to obtain by cracking heads on other maps , do n't turn themselves into masteries or the like through the Encyclopedia , and would be helpful to players who have no real need to raise their own experience points , but very likely still need to progress their Eidolons . <p> But that 's just my perspective , so let me ask : if the monsters in Vulture 's Vale and Blizzard Berg could drop something , something reasonable for the effort being put in , what would you hope to get from them ? <p> Lorn <p> 04-12-2015 , 11:58 PM <p> Nothing because " the effort being put in " is close to zero . It 's simply not something that needs to be fixed . And if you really want to look at it from that perspective , BB and VV already give much better rewards in the form of orange @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crystals , grey items , and green scrolls . <p> " if it was n't a waste of time , would you really worry about being " highly efficient " and stack movement speed to clear the dailies and immediately leave ? " This does n't make any sense whatsoever . If it were a waste of time , people would n't do them at all . Being " highly efficient " simply means expediting something a person wants to do . How you come to the conclusion that accomplishing a task in a " highly efficient " manner actually means " it 's a waste of time " is really beyond me . <p> CELESTI <p> 04-14-2015 , 03:04 AM <p> Because the very definition of efficiency is to avoid wasted effort and resources , which in this instance , includes time . Even if you do n't agree with the basis of the question , that does n't mean it does n't make any sense . <p> I wo n't go out and claim that everyone is trying to raise their movespeed just to clear Vulture 's Vale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people build movespeed for . You 're either dodging red carpets , using no-movement-lock abilities to their maximum potential , or very likely both . Running from place to place just a bit faster is a bonus . <p> I think we have different definitions of " effort " . I see clicking a spot on the map/quest tracker to get a prize as " no effort " . I see fighting things as " some effort " . And to say that these two maps provide better rewards than every other map drops , just because you can eventually get an orange mastery , is funny . Something I only need to get once and ca n't be traded is a better reward than something I will almost always need and can sell if I do n't ?

It becomes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and snowy are n't the only maps that works like that in the game ; two other maps were added later on that did n't had any dungeon on them and that will get added soon here . The fact the medals works as a daily reward is , if anything , a way to extend the use of those maps . What is and what is not tedious is just too much of a subjective thought to go there . For some people the production system is , for others repeadetly farming the same dungeons over and over , heck for some others organizing a group for sky tower is . All I can say is that , despite of subjective thoughts , I believe the system is balanced in this case . Of course , it could become a true bother if you have more than 1 character to farm masteries for , but that 's not to blame on the game design . As for masteries themselves , nothing that can have a direct impact on your stats/skills is never an underworthy reward , is literally the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

Even if you do n't agree with the basis of the question , that does n't mean it does n't make any sense . <p> Of course , Sky Tower must be a waste of time because we try to clear it within a minimal time frame . Every dungeon must also be a waste of time because everyone tries to clear them as fast as possible . Better tell those people who say " Need Carry " in their dungeon recruitment that they are wasting their time . Let 's just not do any of those and spend all of our time afking in Navea because they 're obviously a waste of time . The extension of your logic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waste of time and is not worth doing . <p> All maps become outdated after a certain point until the game devs decide to make them relevant again ( archaeology being a good example , and also applies to the two maps being discussed ) .

I did n't  expect Hera , I went and assumed that Athena would be top tier like other eidolons but I got disappointed when i saw both of them inside a random bag . I do n't wan na see myself getting the same keys like before . Ex . Serena 's promotion , with 4 tries , i got 2 cleos , 1 cross and 1 Serena . They cost 4.5k per chance too ...

If you have the auto-closing issue , you only need to repatch in order to fix . The new patch should be available as soon you run your launcher , but if its not try closing and re-open it again , It may be due to a patcher issue in your zone . Sorry it took so much that expected , we found some unpredicted problems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A little tip for anyone having possible issues with the files . If you seem to get an error while patching , press ok . Once the updating process is over , close your client and open it again . If that do n't seem to work , try a full scan . I had similar issues while patching the first time , and therefor I could n't see all the Paragon items . But after a few attempts , it got fix without any need of reinstall . <p> If you find any problem , please report it to us in the bug section .

@@23370447 @3370447/ <p> This guide will still be delayed a lot as I need to work on the content a bit due to the lv90 not being fully released . <p> Additionally , this guide may receive a drastic change in it 's title + content as I experimented a bit with tanking . <p> I. Introduction <p> Greetings fellow azurians and welcome to my guide on how to become a viable Tank Guardian ! My name is Shironius and I play Aura Kingdom since May 2015 . Ever since then I started maining Tank Guardian until today and I will continue doing so . I have recieved a lot of trashtalk about how Tank Guardian is entirely useless and should be completely replaced by DPS Guardians , but none of this managed to put me off of what I am doing in-game . Also , I found out that people still read ages-old tank guides like from KingTank from the OS ( which is outdated since lv60 era ended ) , therefore I decided to make a fresh Tank Guardian Guide . <p> This guide is probably 75% dedicated to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ build , go check out the old guide from Yuumu . Slightly outdated , but still doing the job --&gt; HERE LONG ... &lt;-- In case some crucial info is lacking , it will be mentioned in this guide for today 's gears and standards . <p> II . Why Tank Guardian ? <p> Either you are or want to become a traditional tank-type player , you are sick of healing but not being able to protect people , DPSing all day becomes boring for you or you are a masochist and enjoy 200 mobs poking you while you stand still , do nothing except raising your Phalanx and basically never die . Ever . Also armors , because you simply ca n't deny how awesome armors are on Guardians . <p> III . Pros and Cons <p> Pros : - Your envoy path greatly benefits from high HP + DEF and rewards you with DMG. - Tank gear is possibly the cheapest gear out there and has an array of good options . - Hands down highest survivability of all classes in the game with various defensive skills . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you play it right . <p> Cons : - You are not dealing significant damage against bosses , so soloing is futile in tank equipment . - Making mistakes is visible to anyone due to the nature of Guards being supposed to stay alive + keep aggro. - People toss defensive gear and enchants a lot of times so you may have a hard time getting the stuff you want . <p> IV . The Build <p> Prologue - Different types of Guardians ( seriously , read it ) <p> Before you go on to the detailed build section , keep in mind that there are various ways to play Guardian as there are different ways of surviving and handling fights . <p> All-Round As an all-round tank , you utilize various methods of survival such as Nocturnal , a medium level of heal procs and heal-over-time effects ( short HoT now ) for sustain and a mixture of decent Damage Reduction and EVA ( both around 60% or higher ) . Overall a balanced variant that puts emphasis on putting up high defensive stats and then follows up with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( or tanks ) . Major Representative : xKari <p> Regeneration-Based This tank stacks various HoT elements like the Lv75 Tank Armor with Ballad and regeneration trophies + enchant cards , uses Revitalizing Wall to receive heals from mobs attempting to hurt him and puts a high emphasis on a very high HP , EVA , HEAL and Damage Reduction . They are almost invincible , but due to their abundance of gear being used on survival they may come short regarding holding aggro unless they have a very high fortification level . Usually seen to use Bard or Crusader sub . Bonus : Does not rely on Nocturnal cores . Major Representative : Gaz <p> Crit-Tank A very special variant that can be considered a " mixed " type , but unlike other mixed builds , there are all five tank armor parts present for the maximum amount of Malice % possible . The main emphasis of this build is CRIT and Damage Reduction . To make this build work , you need at very least 50% CRIT , 200% CRIT DMG , a decent healthpool of 250.000HP or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 60% damage reduction ( with Phalanx applied ) . Usually seen using a CRIT accessory set . Major Representatives : Shironius , Sephimos Origin : Tsunagi <p> DPS Guardian / Mixed One of the most popular choices for DPS players that wish to play Guardian . Again , most if not all of the stuff about this type is covered in Yuumu 's DPS Guardian guide . --&gt; HERE LONG ... &lt;-- Major Representatives : Khai , KimHyuna <p> 1 . Stats <p> Offensive Stats DMG - 99 points here when you finalize your build . It gives so much damage and you can cap or at least get decent stats on the other two with gear . CRIT - I recommend spending the rest of the points here , regardless of your build . If you desperately need the SPD to cap it , put it in SPD instead . SPD - Do n't put points here unless you desperately need SPD for the mainquest ( you pick up things faster for example or to cast Phalanx faster ) . <p> Your best elemental skill that comes with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ applied , such as Weapon Specialization " Storm Warrior " , Envoy Path , using a Lightning weapon or having +x% Lightning Skill DMG . Also has an optional DoT or a multiplicative DEF buff , but I do n't recommend either of those unless you seriously have no mastery that is worth it over these two to begin with . The DoT may be useful for PvP , but I wo n't cover PvP in this guide . <p> Your second skill with an additional Malice effect that also comes with a decent 3-second stun . This skill also has various modifiers that can increase the cone range up to 6 meters , reduce the cooldown to make it semi-spamable and / or increase the stun duration up to 5 seconds . I recommend using at least a green Shield Bash mastery when using the " Divine Shield " path to deal with the large group of mobs that you pulled together with your magnetized Terrifying Roar . <p> Although an elemental skill , it is not recommended to use this as a primary damage skill due to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This skill is best used as a gap closer , to rush through dungeons or to use it as an evasion tool when facing AOE attacks that have an open area behind the boss . The Envoy Path sadly put this skill in a very daring area as the top right corner of the Envoy Path is mainly assisting in PvP and you would need to spend a lot of points to get to the tiles . <p> Your third Malice-based skill , but unlike the previous two , this one does not generate Malice , it resets instead and gives you a small headstart for 4 seconds in the hidden Malice board that this game seriously needs . It also has a very large range and can be upgraded to reduce Move SPD and a magnetizing effect that pulls ( almost ) all non-Boss monsters within proximity to you - this pairs well with any AOE DPS player as you give them an easier time clearing the mobs when they are stacked around you . Refrain from using this skill unless you desperately need to re-take aggro that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) and do not use this skill unless you can survive the horde of mobs or at least be able to actually hold the aggro after using this . <p> The Guardian 's class mechanic . Hold down the skill for a maximum duration of 4 seconds , after this the cooldown hits in . While using this skill , you gain -75% DMG taken and 150% DMG reflection , your party members behind / around you ( needs testing ) will receive an additional shield that will reflect a huge fixed amount of damage when they are hit . Furthermore you can block certain AOE attacks completely ( such as linear AOE from Tavanna or Fenrir ) and you are immune to stuns as long you have the shield up . <p> This is the skill what makes Guardians so much tankier than all the other classes . You receive -30% DMG taken as well as an additional flat -x DMG taken . The -30% DMG taken is only available to main Guardians and the flat -x DMG taken is tripled for main Guardians as well . With the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ party members a shield of 66% of your Phalanx 's -x DMG taken , including yourself . Also has one of the best horde survival masteries in the game , more below in the mastery section . <p> Your passive reflect shield buff . It is lacking use in PvE , cast it anyways though as it has a chance to proc a " Zeal " effect when hit that hits for a certain amount of your primary weapon DMG . More popular in PvP , but PvP gears give reflect effects a hard time due to the insane amount of -x% Player DMG taken . <p> Buffs your party with additional DEF . Usually not that necessary , still not bad as it buffs your DEF and DEF overcap results into a HP boost . Use it unless you have a better party buff on your subclass . <p> Brute Force ( bottom right ) - adds 75% of your DEF to DMG . With +20 armor this is already like 30.000 DMG . No reason not to use it . Shield Punishment ( top left ) - a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against anything and 40% against Bosses and Elites . Malicious Stance ( bottom left , above ) - +50% Malice . Your core stat to make the build work . Taunt ( bottom left , below ) - Once you start attacking anything , you create an invisible area around you that debuffs for -5% DEF and also let 's mobs react to you insanely fast . Good for luring . You also deal " burst malice " which still beats me how it works in detail , but it gives you a huge malice multiplier on all skills ( including subclass ) . Thunder Cut x2 - +16% DMG on your primary malice skill means more malice and more heal from nocturnal effects . Shield Bash x2 - reduces the cooldown of Shield Bash to 2.3s , which allows you to chain Thunder Cut and Shield Bash in a 1-2 fashion . Also 5 seconds stun are hillarious . <p> I did not pick " Intimidating Shout " because with Burning Aircut , Organized Sabotage and a Protector core you are already very close to the DMG shred limit . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ primary weapon even as a non-crit Guardian is that criticals basically are a kind of Zeal for you as you will get at least 10% CRIT somehow . So why not . Also do n't bother with the reflect nodes as they will give very little if anything even in PvP . <p> Shironius <p> 09-19-2016 , 04:28 PM <p> -delayed- http : **25;9846;TOOLONG <p> Shironius <p> 09-20-2016 , 07:34 AM <p> -reserving a 4th one just to be sure ( character limit op ) - <p> Shironius <p> 09-20-2016 , 01:56 PM <p> -reserving the 5th one for maximum security due to the lv90 cbt showing up and therefore more content to be posted in here- <p> chaserblood <p> 09-23-2016 , 03:33 PM <p> -reserving the 5th one for maximum security due to the lv90 cbt showing up and therefore more content to be posted in here- <p> I 'm waiting for this ; ) .

My old guardian is MoRuL. from batch 2014 ppl know me. that my full tank guardian , i was active on PVP too long time ago . especially at centurion and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through all this sweet and bitter experience . until now i am still stay as guardian but still i missed that old time too . I quit as full tank guard have some reason . I go dps guardian have some reason and i have my story too . This AK is not let you tank so long . Bcoz other party will burn all mobs and boss bfore you tank and roar . In era lv65 , full tank is god . Evry ST search this and bard too . For current patch now , evrything ppl need more dps . Is not about full tank is sink , but this game made full tank or full support is sinked . Is not player fault to quit as that role but is xlegend . The reason why i go dps guardian bcoz long time ago ppl look down the guardian , and say guardian is weak and just know to tank or leeching . This sarcasm still on going until now . And i like help ppl to lvling especially with gf or guildies . Sometime i need 2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go Dps guardian and for fun too . About AA spd , i am not no pay attention about that . i know AA spd good for jumpcast But you must know , some guardian 's skill is not work for jumpcast . For me is wasted build like that . I prefer going dealt dmg more instead AA spd . AA spd very suit for range . For melee sometime jumpcast in this server have bugged . This is why i am not going into build AA spd anymore . And i am just do freestyle build . what i mean freestyle is , i like to change sub class following my mood . Not all sub class i tested . And i love freestyle build and not really go serious build . This is how my playstyle as guardian . You du n no how challenging as dps guardian . Let me tell you , not all DPS is same way and simply . Guardian is hard to improve their DMG , is like puzzle . you need to solve that problem . guardian have no special skill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same way their build like other DPS class . they are different . to be dps guardian your brain sometime hard to stop thinking . bcoz you need to balance them offensive and defensive , timing , solving the problem . And i am not modern way or anything . i just slacking way build xD <p> Btw good luck for your guide hope you complete them all .

Before anyone starts flaming , let me say that I 've played every single previous paragon table except the eidolon one in which I had no interest and reached the top tier a few times within 5,000 ruby coins or less and usually would 've won at least something with 10,000 coins so I do know how much it should cost on average to get something . The way this was feeling today , it felt like Aeria all over again . Not only did I fail to reach the tier 1 even once , I only reached tier 2 once and tier 3 maybe 5-10 times or so of which most landed on emerald shards ( this includes using all the emerald shards that I got in between ) , that seems really low from my experience . <p> Ayasel <p> 04-18-2014 , 02:35 AM <p> Well , its just your lack of luck <p> Alice <p> 04-18-2014 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of luck Our rates are suppose to be better .

@@23370453 @3370453/ <p> Well , since I 've seen a lot of people having problems with the launcher I decided to post this . I know that there 's another ways to bypass the launcher but this one was posted by Aura-Sama LONG ... some time ago . <p> This guide will have 2 Steps . If you just want to know how to bypass go to the 2nd step . <p> Step 1 : <p> Just the usual , run your Luncher.exe file as admin an make sure to have your anti-virus off . http : **25;9873;TOOLONG <p> http : **25;9900;TOOLONG After the launcher is patched and ready to go you can close it . <p> Step 2 : <p> Now that your game is updated we can start the launcher bypass . <p> In your Aura folder you will search for the game.bin file . Right click and rename it ( or just select it and press F2 ) . http : **25;9927;TOOLONG <p> Your game.bin should be gone ( do n't panic , its ok xD ) and a file like this should be in its place . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this file and put it wherever you want ( mine is in Desktop ) . http : **25;9981;TOOLONG <p> Now you will open the properties of this shortcut ( Right Click &gt; Properties ) . On the Target box , after the *Aura Folder*client.exe you will add the words EasyFun ( without space ) , it will look like this : http : **25;10008;TOOLONG ( It 's in portuguese , so Destino = Target ) <p> You will run your game through this shortcut now , it will bypass the launcher and save you some time . : D <p> PS : You still need to run the Launcher.exe after every Maintenance/Patch so the game can update ( you will need to redo your client.exe with the new game.bin too ) . Disclaimer : If you are having any other problem with the launcher , like missing files or w/e , or if you get any problem after doing this ITS NOT MY FAULT , I 'm just a player trying to help other players . I can still try to help you if you have any question about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your face after you do this ( some friends had some bugs and we figured out how to solve them ) , it 's not an " OH YEAH M8 , I KNOW HOW TO SOLVE THIS !

@@23370459 @3370459/ 21183 @qwx221183 <h> GUIDEMomo-chan 's Short and Basic Gunslinger Knowledge Updated <p> GUIDE UPDATED AS OF NOV. 28 , 2014 ! <p> Introduction First of all , any subclass will do here . Up to you what to pick . <p> Gunslinger is a DPS class that shoots away your enemy with high burst damage from a distance ( Well , of course. ) , but unlike other classes , our skills have much much faster cooldown , and the animation of the skills are faster too , and prefer kiting . <p> Why choose Gunslinger ? Nope , I wo n't say anything like " it 's an easy and a beginner friendly class ! " . Yep , absolutely not . But I can say that , it 's fun to play and it 's challenging to play as one too . If you 're not a fan of luring or killing a school of mobs , then this class is suited for you . That 's it . Boring right ? <p> Ultraviolet Catastrophe - Front Splash Damage skill . The skill which has the shortest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Frost Trap - Immobilizes any enemy who steps on it , taking Damage per second and increasing their critical hits received . <p> Dark Flare Trap - Dealing continuous damage to any enemy who 're in its range , reducing their received healing . <p> Decoy - Charms an enemy ( monsters only ) around a certain level , making them your ally for a few seconds . <p> Mental Focus - Increases SPD of you and your party members . <p> Stat Point Allocation And Gears(70+) <p> Before anything else , I bet some people will think " Oh , it 's a long range DPS , an Eva-type build is great " because of the 5% passive eva on envoy . But it 's not the case anymore ! Get as much Eva as you want , and you still wo n't be able to dodge that much on bosses especially in sky tower ! So in this guide , we 're gon na focus on how to maximize our Defense and HP and damage output . <p> PvE Stats : ( There 's a visual bug in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right now and gears . I 'm using Sniper Set now . <p> On early levels , just using green gears is enough to survive given that you can allocate your stat points to your needs until level 60 . And by the time you hit level 60 , you might be tempted to use Devourer set as it has a good stats , which is Crit/Hp/Eva . Which is I wo n't forbid you too , besides , I would suggest to use the set while you 're at it , but the top ones only , because of the +set effect . Then use Revelation Set on your bottoms . <p> These will be your accessories until you get the preferred level 65 accessories , which you will see below . If you find it hard to craft or buy it , you can settle for the Comets accessories , they 're cheap and has good stats too . <p> The reason I picked this set over Lethal beast is that , one thing is the HP stat . Well , we 're focusing on Def HP again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HP , but in exchange for DPS . I picked this because I tested Lethal Beast too , and it was my first set to be honest . But it was back when I was using Uzuriel as my Eidolon , but I sucked at PvP . Because my DMG was a little low and cruel rush rarely procs on players . <p> Suggested Envoy Path at 75 . I took two ultimates for dire situations . ( LOL ) <p> Red , Yellow and Orange Colors are top priority in getting first at early levels . The two ultimates and the aimed shot mastery is up to you if you will take it or leave it . They 're open for changes , for you <p> I 'll share my experiences as a gunslinger if you do n't mind ; it might be able to help your guide since I 'm lazy to make one . XD <p> First , I still prefer Lethal Beast over Lion 's Roar , reasons being Gunslingers have fast enough cooldown to spam their skill rotations to proc food , Orange Zeal , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tons of damage to a single target . It 's also easier to cap CRIT DMG as compared to just increasing CRIT , since Lethal Beast gives flat +11% CRIT . I 'd say that Lion 's Roar is still good for lower budgeted players because of the HP stat , but reaching 90k HP as a Gunslinger with Katar sub can be reached with two Thunderous secret stones and Float . <p> For the trophies , I agree that Teda 's is a really good choice for gunslingers . Toto 's Shard is still decent , but I recommend replacing it with Nirvana if you have the budget or DC to buy it . Taking Otto 's into account , Yarnaros , as well as pumping a lot of DMG points , the DMG to HP conversion is pretty huge in terms of our survivability . <p> Lastly , for Tactical Spec , since everyone seems to be using Organized Sabotage and Break Defense , I think that Orange Crippling mastery is best . It synergizes well with Gunslingers because along with Aimed Shot , it becomes much easier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's good to see another gunslinger main since our class seems to be dying lol XD <p> I 'll share my experiences as a gunslinger if you do n't mind ; it might be able to help your guide since I 'm lazy to make one .

Both set are good anyways depending on what Eidolon you will use . Like when I used Lethal Beast + Uzuriel Eidolon . But at most , I can only have around 60k HP in PvP , since I use one Zephyr stone . Getting Crit DMG cap is easy with Uzuriel Eidolon but with Yarnaros , it 's impossible . The Cruel Rush is good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rarely in PvP 's . <p> I have the DC for Nirvana but since I have 78k-80k HP in PvE 's , I decided not to get it , for now . I rarely play anyways . Still doing tests on how far the Crit DMG of Gunslingers will go with Lion 's Roar set + Yarnaros Eidolon then I 'll decide if Toto is worth replacing for Nirvana in PvP's. 
@@23370460 @3370460/ <p> I came here to ask you about some useful tips for my prim . brawler and sec. ronin .

Here 's the change log : <p> Adjusted bouncing mechanic to some skills . Eidolons , Summons , structures in pvp wo n't be counted as bouncing target anymore . This change is a nerf to Holy Sword and a buff to Necro . <p> Ravager : Increase the number of flying axes from upgraded Flame Slash ( left specialization path ) . This is probably bc ppl went for the path just for rage decay , while right path is strong enough to go for , ignoring the left path . <p> Grenadier : more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bard : All bard 's basic healing skills have their healing reduced by 20% in PvP . All bard 's dps skills and the dmg specialization skill dmg increased by 15% in PvP . Needless to say : a direct nerf to Serg , I mean healtanks in pvp , but might benefit some dps bards . Brawler : DMG and healing effect of Lotus Strike and Inner Strength when used with charges increased . More katar buff .... STAHP . <p> Necromancer : - % DMG to convert to the familiars increased ( initial envoy ) , from 10% to 15%. ( was 5% first release , then buffed to 10% , now 15% ) - CD of " Summon Familiar " reduced 30s. ( was 180s first release , then reduced to 60s , now 30s ) - Familiars gain 50% players dmg reduction . Great , really helping the class to get out of the " crap tier mindset " of the community , while benefit experienced players more and more . <p> Holy Sword : - " Thunder God Sky Strike " ( aka the Lightning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now have bouncing effect without the need to Holy break . - " Thunder God Sky Strike " now only bounce to a target once . ( previously it can bounce multiple times , killing the target easily with the burst ) . This is a super nerf to that skill alone in pvp , bring the class down to human level , but still very OP compare to Rav . The nerf is right-on-spot .

@@23370464 @3370464/ <p> Guardian Ruins cellar dungeon guide Also known as the less painless way to get Valor coins daily dungeon , HOORAY ! <p> Despite being a level 80 content , the dungeon itself feels like a Mirabelle daily x Dimension Hall dungeon . I say this because the moment you activate the quest , you 're granted a buff , the same one used in Mirabelle quests , where your character has even more buffed HP so you have lesser chances of dying . DH because you can rinse and repeat this dungeon an infinite number of times ( good for practicing or if you failed the quest to get the daily ) . <p> That being said , the dungeon can get hectic . In fact if you do n't know what you 're doing and though the crystals are very tanky , they 're not invincible and CAN BE DESTROYED resulting into a failure , as you will see hints from the video . <p> The dungeon ( and daily ) can be accessed as early as level 50 ( although you wo n't actually access Starsand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ located easily enough from the teleporter , very hard to miss unless you 're completely oblivious . <p> http : **29;10437;TOOLONG <p> Take your daily and enter the appropriate dungeon for your level . My Gunslinger at the moment has not reach level 70 so you can only see level 60 but despite that , this is actually my 3rd run and have also done 50 's and 70 's ( highest ) . There 's no difference between the mechanics of the dungeon levels other than perhaps the monsters are probably more tanky and the reward better at higher levels . <p> After talking to the npc , you will be granted the buff . They soon do some voodoo or whatever to revive and heal the crystals . Your job is to protect them after they leave and go get a Starsandwich . No you can not have the sandwich as a reward . <p> The attack waves proceed in a clockwise direction starting at 3 ( east ) , which makes the defense of the wind box a top priority and may ultimately decide if you make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other elemental boxes either . <p> In the second phase , the centerpiece box is only thing thing you need to watchout for . Fortunately you can heal it . While the mobs are still present , the boss is rendered invulnerable and he unleashes a charged AoE attack that can cause mass damage and stun , so , simply , avoid . Once the mob is dealt with , the boss can be killed by any means you want . <p> https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=h5jotqkJANs <p> As you noticed in the video , the element boxes can grant you skills relevant to their element . Although you may chose not to take these skills , you will often come to the rescue of the cubes and get these by accident and they will switch again and again whenever you get too close to a different element . This is where it gets hectic and confusing , especially if you are a melee without much ranged AoE skills . <p> For those planning to do take them or reluctant to do so here 's a simple breakdown what they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as soon as this box is completed phase 1 ends and all the mobs die . <p> Recommendation Strategy using the boxes : You can opt to ignore the wind box . The movespeed buff wo n't help much since you wo n't need to run that far off . However , since it is the earliest box to unlock and the Lizardman is a lightning element it may prove useful to some extent , until the fire box is completed . With the firebox , start off immediately with the damage buff . It could take some getting used to with the 2nd skill but the AoE is massive enough that you could opt to stay as fire . Plus the 1st skill of fire is n't too shabby either since the mobs approach in linear waves . <p> Even if you prefer to aim for Dark , I still insist getting fire first and take the fire buff since as you noticed in the video , the buff stays even after I had taken the dark element so not only am I fast skill spammer , I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invulnerable and must avoid stunning AoE until mobs are dealth with , then proceed to kill off the boss . <p> Recommended Best Class for the Dungeon - Wizard , or any ranged class with good AoE skill although it is n't a must as you can see I managed fairly okay with a Gunslinger . <p> Elemental gear and potions may help but it is n't necessary . I did fairly alright without these either . <p> Best Recommended Eidolons are the usual Yam and Eligos . Movespeed Eidos come second . Eidos focused on particular elements ( Ice and Lightning in general ) are also good , especially if these Eidos have AoE of their own but beware , active Eidos are marginal at best since the mobs and especially Reyes have red AoEs that can make short work of them . <p> Overall , I think this dungeon would be more fun with 3 other people , each taking an element . Here 's to hoping Xlegend will make a party version sometime but I doubt it . The dungeon already filled its purpose as a Valor coin outlet . XD

So yes you can not get DMG 8% on both 1 &amp; 2 Star Buffs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Attack Speed is great cause you can hit between skills more frequently , but you can cap it . So say you already cap normal attack speed with the 25% , if you get the 50% on top of that , it 'd still be the same attack speed/it wont go any faster . <p> I suggest if you 're stuck with which eidolon to reroll , go with one that has better eidolon skills/eidolon weap that you 'd prefer . For example , right now I 'm using Quelkulan because his eidolon weapon has a chance to decrease an enemy 's stats by 25% , which is pretty nice . But his skills are so-so for PvE.

For example the exp books you get from fish kings . I usually get 500 of those . <p> If there is already something like this in the game , like feeding 1 whole stack in a single go , then please do teach me . Sorry for the newbie question/suggestion . <p> My personal trick is binding it to two keys , like 1 and 2 for example , then pressing both simultaneously . Weirdly sometimes the book is consumed at a slower rate when I click many buttons at once , 2 is the best for me ( just alternate with middle finger and index finger ) .

@@23370469 @3370469/ <p> Disclaimer : I do n't think my build / setup is perfect nor do I think it 's the best one out there however so far it 's given me amazing rules in pve and slightly decent results in pvp so I decided to share it with you guys , if you have any tips / adjustments which could make it better would love to see them here . I hope the guide is clear and understandable , I tried to make it look appealing though I personally do n't think that matters as much as the content . <p> Why Necromancer ? To begin with it 's the most recent class released and without a doubt one of the most flashy classes to this date ( in terms of the skills ) , the class itself is incredibly fun to play at least I can say from my experience , since I started it at level 55 I stuck through till 65+ without really getting bored because the class is so flexible in the way you can play it . Really until you try the class you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necromancers running those level 55 dungeons I thought " wow that looks like sh*t " because of the low damage and requirement to spam so many skills to kill one monster or a group of them , after actually playing it I found that if built right it really is a fun class to play , the summons , the aoe skills ( 2 major ones ) and natural tankiness that comes with being a necromancer . <p> Subclass I 'll stick to the subclasses I 've tested myself and my personal opinion why or why not they suit a necromancer . <p> Bard - Pros : High self-healing ability ( in both pve and pvp ) through both ballad and healing skills Ballad for the damage increase ( using the damage mastery ) **Stun** The main focus of this guide is using a Sorcerer as your subclass , that being said it has no stuns at it 's disposal , making bard sub possibly enticing to a lot of people . <p> Cons : You wont be using much of your subclass skills offensively as you might with another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Again personally I found it boring to play with , sorcerer was a lot more fun . No ults <p> Sorcerer - Pros : Somewhat of a self-heal ( mantra ) which also cleanses you of negative statuses . Nightmare Totem which is amazing in both pve and pvp . Dots which help in pvp when dealing with bards or really tanky builds , also does help in pve but I 'd say it 's not as useful . <p> Cons : Not as good selfheals as a bard subclass in pvp , really in pve you 'll likely be using a nocturnal weapon so the whole healing skils is n't that needed in that perspective . No stuns <p> Stats / Envoy Path OK , so as a Necromancer what is the most important stat ? Wrong ! There is no one most important stat , in my opinion as a necro you 'll need to balance all your offensive stats to some extent , defensive wise getting capped defense is n't much of an obstacle at all so you can pump all of your defensive stats into HP @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ **NOTE** I " m referring to stats in a more general sense rather then just stat points , it is referring to your overall stats which includes gear , envoys , etc . ) <p> Envoys are honestly basic , if you ca n't figure out which are worth getting I would be suprised to say the least . You get 13% HP , 9% raw damage , 12% damage to primary weapon , any spare points should go towards Hell Buterflies , crit damage envoys , and after that if there 's anything left towards critical damage . Actually I left out a few envoys which I 'll post a picture of below but those are more up to you and related towards your specific version of the build . <p> Pump the rest of your points into your HP , if you still have n't capped defense you can allocate some points towards defense however having a 3* eidolon out + stardust foods / special mastery should cap your defense easily <p> Get critical to a decent rate , my opinion is 50%+ Get your damage to as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because ofcourse a level 55 is n't going to hit 100k+ damage Maintain your speed at around 20% through self-party buff + speed foods Heavenly Vanilla Macaroon LONG ... <p> http : **29;10468;TOOLONG <p> http : **29;10499;TOOLONG <p> As you can see above my stats are n't too impressive , my damage is insanely low because I 'm still pretty new on my necromancer thus my level is low ( 67 ) , my equipment is pretty shotty and I 'm still experimenting with the class however as for the current pve content this damage and crit is perfectly fine for it . The main thing you should keep in mind is maintaining at least 50% critical rate , having around 20% speed ( possible with food+ptbuff ) and the rest into pumping your damage . <p> " Should I get Evasion ? " While it does work in pve I 'd say no . HP is a lot more useful , you 'll be a lot tankier and in pvp eva will only make you tanky vs crappy pvpers who do n't have any acc , you 'll get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important aspect to any guide is the way you play your character , I find it hard to describe my strategy but I will try , likely I 'll post some videos of dungeons on my necro so you can better understand , anyways : <p> 1 . As a necromancer/sorcerer following this guide you should now be tanky enough to be at the front of the party in most dungeons , for this example I 'll use otherworld at/gg/ms hell runs . Basically what I do in solo or in a party is lure all the mobs to the first boss , put the mobs to sleep ( totem ) then proceed to use the Demon Bats skill ( images of skills posted below ) thus hitting the majority of mobs while also using the nocturnal sub weapon to it 's full extent and healing myself , also note our HP should be really high so the mobs will take longer to burn through it . After Demon bats is done I 'd hit Ghost summoning which is our other aoe skill and proceed to kite the mobs with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ damage on ) and auto hits till they are dead , if I get into a situation where I 'm about to die I just hit an ult while jumping to get myself away from the mobs . <p> Items / gear : Given that I went over stats already I wont go into too depth about items , just the core ones you should be using . <p> Bottom set - <p> http : **29;10530;TOOLONG <p> Top set - <p> http : **29;10561;TOOLONG <p> I plan on going full sniper set later for pve , I think the damage/crit/speed increase is PERFECT for necromancers , and you can still maintain a decent amount of HP . <p> Still being worked on / CONTINUED <p> Deucalion <p> 09-26-2014 , 02:16 AM <p> Reserved for updates on the guide <p> Deucalion <p> 09-26-2014 , 02:16 AM <p> -- Reserved for updates on the guide -- <p> Eraviel <p> 09-26-2014 , 02:57 AM <p> I have some serious question regarding the Terrorizing Black Flame Raid skill . <p> Does it increase the skill damage by 20% , like with the Soul Reaver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Because if it is , it 's gon na be OP since the green one is 40% , and the orange will be 60% O.O <p> Or there 's some mistake in here ... ? I was doubting that because of the 10 sec duration in the skill . O.O <p> The black flame raid I wan na say is n't pure dmg boost , but rather the bonus dmg boost . Black flame raid states that it deals bonus dmg , so I think the 20% , 40% , 60% deals more with how much dmg the target receives as a bonus when that mastery is active . Thinking about it kinda like zeal , you deal bonus dmg , based off 50% of your overall dmg , then with the next mastery , you deal 70% as bonus .. ect ect . Could be wrong , their hard to test , especially when flame raid states that its stack-able , which it does n't seem to be . <p> Deucalion <p> 09-26-2014 , 04:35 AM <p> The black flame raid I wan na say is n't pure dmg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flame raid states that it deals bonus dmg , so I think the 20% , 40% , 60% deals more with how much dmg the target receives as a bonus when that mastery is active .

If you 're comparing only Ravager vs Gunslinger , Ravager will win majority of the time . Ravager will obviously clear a huge mob faster since RnR is a radius hit while Gunslinger is either linear or cone ( kinda messy cone though ) . Against single target , I would say that depends on the Ravager and Gunslinger . <p> PVP does n't matter . Majority of Ravagers just do Soaring Slash + RnR ( move around if necessary ) . Majority of Gunslingers will do Aim Shot + Sonic Bomb + Bombardment ( traps on spawn area ) . They both can excel if built and played correctly . <p> Can you give me the pros and cons of both of these two ? Thorn provides a Pro/Con list : Thorns ' Ravager/GS of DOOM ! LONG ...

Can someone link me to a decent DPS Bard guide/build ... I 'm just not good at finding stuff : ( Do n't think I 've seen any guides about DPS Bard . Majority of things , such as stats and envoy , are usually the same as a Support Bard . The only difference is the type of gears you might focus on . You can pretty much learn about Bard 's from this guide : Hime 's Full Support Bard/Sorc Guide *Updated now with PvP* LONG ... You would just need to change things around to be a DPS Bard . <p> Eraviel <p> 08-03-2014 , 11:42 AM <p> So far , GS/Grenadier combination is kinda old right now . Though I 'd give credit to it because of the long range stuns + Aim Shot which is a good combo for it , but you 'll have less mobility . <p> IMO , the good sub for GS right now is Katar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your enemy and pop them with back attack damage . Here 's an example . Note that this has no proc on Discerning attack/food buffs/Zeal or Cruel Rush . Just pure Crit : <p> http : **29;10592;TOOLONG <p> For PvE , Of course , Rav/GS is your wise choice . Because even if you 're a Lvl 75 GS/Grenadier , you can not solo OW Party/Hell excluding the Port Skandia and Helonia coast like the Ravs do . <p> Koocee <p> 08-03-2014 , 02:17 PM <p> Rav/GS is definetly now best for PvE , specially you can easily solo with it all kinds dungeons easily , do n't even have to struggle so much on soloing as GS have to , because of lack AoE . <p> GS/GREN is good for PvP and single target PvE . But GREN turrets is awesome , Flare Turret specially , its AoE stacking DoT one , which actually can tank some mobs from you if your trying to solo PT modes or something tougher , so it will be great assist . And of course GREN is only one with ranged stun , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for PvP katar sub seems better , because of fastest dash to player and stun same time you can easily get traps under it and pretty much dead with next aimed shot . Gunslinger have little hard times sometimes on AoE situations because all are linear AoE 's , but if you want little challenge , you can do it fine with it anyway . Specially while luring all mobs together , you can on way kill them while kiting . Also gunslinger is kinda class , that does n't need from other sub classes that much anything , maybe you could like take Wizard and get some more AoE , but that meteor cooldown will be like 30s , so not that great AoE assistant . Gunslingers anyway mostly just use their own basic skills all the time , after all they are strongest attacks as main class . So you can also try something other subs too , instead gren , like maybe Warbow , great buff for GS but long CD and brings one huge AoE range attack with pretty high dmg too , but its need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ using 99% of my time on combat just gunslinger skills , so sub does n't really that matter , just think what kind utility they could bring you , like : turrets , sorc totem , CC 's , dash skills . Those in mind , pretty much every sub is just fine , not like it will make you any weaker at least because you use GS skills pretty much only to DMG . <p> But Rav/GS definetly for PvE soloing contents and being wanted to every PvE content even . ( Do n't have to suffer from melee discrimination , because they are that OP ) GS is also good against single targets , so good for boss fights like Sky Tower . And of course being ranged brings some advantage for you at PvE content . But if you wan na solo like OW PT/Hell modes , go Ravager and you wo n't regret it . You can also as gunslinger solo them , but will be a lot harder compared to ravas , just spinning around while killing everything . <p> Yakuzaku <p> 08-03-2014 , 07:07 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right now . Though I 'd give credit to it because of the long range stuns + Aim Shot which is a good combo for it , but you 'll have less mobility . <p> IMO , the good sub for GS right now is Katar . Because of the Dash-stun then you can go behind your enemy and pop them with back attack damage . Here 's an example . Note that this has no proc on Discerning attack/food buffs/Zeal or Cruel Rush .

Can someone recommend me fishing gear that will make me capable of catching slightly ' ' stronger ' ' fish that can be worth gold ? <p> Any help is greatly appreciated &lt;3 Thank you in advance <p> Japanime <p> 02-11-2016 , 04:31 PM <p> hiiiiii welcome to ak ps /o/ i 'll try to answer them as best i can ... i may not be 100% accurate though . <p> 1 . yes housing is here ! ! ! i do n't believe the quest to enter my house showed up on my alts till after i finished the level 55 quests. as far as requirements go , you will need to level your house to gain access to different types of furniture annnnnd on top of that you 'll need to level fishing , gathering , archaeology , cooking and stuff to make the high-end stuff . <p> 2. just cuz .. its not hard to get to level 60 these days anyway : d <p> 3. pets give you different boost in stats like hp , dmg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alone .. but i do n't  like being harassed by people either . TT you could always join a relaxed guild ! <p> 5. erm .. is it 90 these days ? highest i have is 83 and i do n't  feel like grinding . but at 80 you 'll have access to all areas ( as far as i know ) <p> 6. i am confused . @. @ <p> 7. i feel your pain completely . i hate fishing ... all i remember is camping vv for the gear there and then doing fish kings . look for a dmg set though ! <p> Spookyy <p> 02-11-2016 , 04:39 PM <p> Can you explain to me how to get to housing system ? If you did n't , cause if you did , I do n't quite get it D : <p> For 6th , I meant something like this . You have gunslinger character , he is level 55 . If I make other character , say , bard , and there was an option to make that bard character level 55 , like your other character @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rise them parallely with your highest level character , and not just level , but all quests should be dragged . That 's something suggested now , it was declined , so I was wondering how can this mechanic be abused by players ? <p> Japanime <p> 02-11-2016 , 04:51 PM <p> if you follow the main quest line all the way through the level 55 map quests , a random quest should pop up taking you to the house npc in navea. there you 'll be able to enter the house ! <p> now i understand lol ! it would be nice to be able to have all my alts automatically be the same level as my main , but i can see why that would cause problems .. most likely with pvp. i do n't pvp at all .. ever .. so i cant give you examples as to why . anyway ... you can reach level 80 in 1 week ( if not 2 weeks ) if you do all of your quests . <p> SweetSlayer <p> 02-11-2016 , 08:10 PM <p> 1 . You need to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ventos and ssd ) and you 'll get pop-up quest to navea <p> 2 . It 's originally that in TW , and basically only because it has it 's own opening storyline <p> 3 . Different pets have different stats but not all have stats ( yet , aura said that you might be able to change the buffs in the future ) <p> 4 . It 's a bad thing only if to you it feels like a bad thing . You usually can solo party and even hell modes if you have decent gear anyway <p> 5 . Lvl cap is 90 and you will be able to access all areas at lvl 75 IF you have done your main quests <p> 6 . Nope , you start over and you have to do all quests again , no way to pass them and there wo n't be a way ( it has been discussed many times ) <p> 7 .

There is still at least however the treasure boxes you can open and sell to npcs but dungeons still earn more . <p> You 're not the first one to ask for gear though , LONG ... <p> Spookyy <p> 02-15-2016 , 06:38 PM <p> Well I hate fishing and I am glad to hear fishing wo n't earn me gold . It 's complicated and I feel completely lost and helpless . So far , dungeons were my source of gold , and always aimed to have them stay like it , I just wanted to see what was I doing wrong because as soon as I 'd come across somewhat stronger fish , I have better chances of surviving nuclear bomb than catching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> FreuFreu <p> 02-15-2016 , 07:05 PM <p> I should probably add this as extra mention though . While you might hate ( and therefore abandon ) fishing , it is however one of the production ranks to do . Besides the fishing gear set adds some stats so it ca n't hurt even if you do n't aim for colossal set . <p> SweetSlayer <p> 02-16-2016 , 11:19 AM <p> I should probably add this as extra mention though .

Thank you all for your responses ! <p> Well many people hated doing fishing , but fishing got few benefits : <p> 1 . The tier 7 fishing dmg set will give your char around 6k++ dmg <p> 2 . With better fishing eqs , it is easier to complete eido prayers ( eido prayers gives you some nice bonus stats as well ) <p> So overall , it does gives you some extra stats : D <p> In the end , of course it is still up to individual preference , some people do n't  do fishing yet they are OP as hell : D <p> Spookyy <p> 02-16-2016 , 05:53 PM <p> Yeah so in other words you " have to " fish if you want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

It says from selling furniture , but I got ta get furniture from somewhere ? <p> You craft furniture then sell the furniture to the npc inside your house . <p> FreuFreu <p> 02-16-2016 , 11:36 PM <p> And if you must inquire further , yes , in a nutshell the entire housing system is one big money sink , more so than pvp ( at least pvp gives 1% stats ) so I would recommend this last and only on meta gaming . On the other hand as what would my friend Sky put it .

With the spirit of finding those individuals , we will look for the best dressed characters to each part : <p> - The Elegant Envy of any party , this person always seems to find the right combination of clothes , accesories , ornaments , and even colors . He or she is always self-aware of his gestures and actions , reason why you will never see this person making an embarrassment of himself . <p> - The Extravagant While some dress to make a good impression , some dress to impress .

How can i see my points and use them ? Thank you for your answers <p> You can open Encyclopedia from one of those icons around minimap . There you have amount and categories , groups , tables of items . Some of them like enchantments costs are quite low like 3.000 but others some crazy amount <p> Yes DC is a way to buy items from the encyclopedia , given you 've earned enough dragon coins . As mentioned above sometimes it may have extra requirements aside from the dragon coins for example the Flojka accessories ( level 65 speed ones ) requires both DC + sky dragon symbols ( earned from the sky dragon lament ) .

Amanthea is one of the new students for Sapphire Class and now this is where her story begins . <p> " Waah I 'm finally admitted in here ... Their requirements are so strict . It took me a month to reach above 60 skill ... " Amanthea muttered while walking towards the Sapphire Class . <p> Amanthea soon reached her class and went inside . She looked around for a vacant seat and saw one beside a black haired young man . " E-Excuse me ... Is someone sitting in here ?

I can do social dancing and so some dinning etiquette . " the young handsome silver haired man told them with a smile . <p> " Kyaaa ! ! He 's so cool !

" she asked . <p> Zaro nodded , " Yes , they are ... But some of them are kind too . " he told her . <p> " Ooh ... I wonder when we 'll get our class badges . I might meet one of their students without knowing that they belong to Ruby Class . " Amanthea said , sighing . <p> " Hm ... I think it would be fine ... You just have to worry if you meet one of their Top Students ... " Zaro told her . <p> They reached the cafeteria and went inside .

" Zaro said as they went out of the cafeteria . <p> Amanthea opened her pack of potato chips and started to eat , " How do I know that it 's him ? " she asked . <p> " He always wears a creepy mask . He 's also purple hair and he laughs like a mad man . " Zaro replied . <p> " Oh ok , noted ! " Amanthea said with a smile . <p> Zaro nodded , " And one more person ... A right , Phoenix .

He is n't badly injured , such a lucky guy . " Zaro chuckled a bit before drinking his water . <p> Amanthea sighed , " I see ... Waahh .. They are so dangerous ....

" <p> While walking , a sudden creepy laugh interrupted their quiet atmosphere . This laugh sent chills on Amanthea 's spine . She looks ahead and saw Janus plus a silver/white haired guy who have menacing crimson eyes . <h> Chapter 2 <p> Zaro went in front of Amanthea and glared at them . Janus just tilted his head and it seems like he is really interested on Amanthea . <p> " Janus and Phoenix , huh ... " Zaro muttered . <p> Amanthea peeked from Zaro 's back to take glimpse of ' Phoenix ' . <p> " Ow come on Why glare like that at us ?

I also want to talk with her We have n't been getting new students lately . " he told him in a disappointed tone . <p> " Heh . Too bad for you then . " Zaro replied with a smirk . <p> Phoenix suddenly appeared behind Amanthea and grabbed a handful of chips , " It 's actually fine . The lesser the noisy people inside , the better . " he said . <p> Amanthea gasped and looked at him but instead of getting scared , " He took a lot ! ( ? ? ? ) " she thought , eyebrow twitching . <p> " Ohoho I can feel a great power inside of you " Janus told Amanthea then his eyes suddenly narrows , " ... but I think I encountered this kind of energy before ... Nahh , maybe I 'm just overthinking Hahaha " he said with a grin . <p> " E-Eh ? ! " Amanthea tried to break free from Janus ' grasp . <p> The sapphire ring on Zaro 's right hand glows then a red spear appeared on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " So your name is Amanthea " <p> Zaro charged at him , " Let go of her ! " <p> Janus pushed Amanthea in front of him with her hand on her back , making her as a shield which made Zaro stop his attack . " Y-You ... " he glared at him , gripping his spear tighter . <p> Amanthea suddenly stomped on Janus ' foot then turns around as soon as he loses his grip on her , " I hate creepy guys ! ( # ) /+ ? " she exclaimed as she kicked him on his heavenly spot and glares at him darkly while gritting her teeth . <p> Zaro looked at her confused , " E-Eh-- Uhm , Amanthea .. ? " he sweatdropped . <p> Amanthea turned to Phoenix as she returned back to her normal personality , " H-Hey-- Wait-- uhm , I did n't  mean it-- QAQ " she said while stepping back . <p> Phoenix finished eating the chips and walks towards them with his serious menacing crimson eyes . <p> Zaro 's eyes widens that he ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned to Amanthea , " Run ! " <p> Amanthea begun to tremble a bit , " I ... " her eyes widens as Phoenix stands in front of her . <p> " You 're trembling . " he grins , " Scared , are n't you ? " he asked her as he extends his hands to her . <p> Amanthea shuts her eyes close but feels nothing but her pack of chips being taken away , " E-Eh ? " she looked at Phoenix . <p> Phoenix took a chip from the pack and ate it , " Chips does n't suit you . " he told Amanthea before walking to Janus and picking him up . " I 'll tell the Superior about what you did . " he told Janus as he walked away . <p> Janus paled , " E-Eh ? Why ? I 'm the one who was hurt ! ! " he told Phoenix then turned to Amanthea , " See you around , Princess " he told her with a smirk . <p> " By yourself ? How brave . " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ safe for now , lil kid . But next time ... Prepare yourself , I wo n't go easy on you especially if we get matched up for the Tournament . " he told her in a serious tone . <p> Amanthea gulped and looked back at him , " He sounds pretty serious about it but ... " she stared at him but then shook away the thought and continued to walk . <p> Later on , Amanthea returned to her class , carrying a pile of papers . She placed it down on Marisa 's table then she went back to her seat . <p> " Phew .. So tiring ... " Amanthea muttered . <p> Zaro took out a candy from his pocket , " Have this " <p> " Oh thanks , Zaro. " she took the candy and ate it . <p> Marisa begun to distribute the papers to them , " Those are the new assigned training rooms for the different Spar Classes . Remember to be there on time " she told them . <p> Amanthea read the schedule and saw the dismissal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ required to have dorms . " <p> " Oh and ... Bad news . The Ruby Class will be sharing rooms with us for Spear and Blades Spar Class for the whole semester . " Marisa told them with a sigh . <p> " W-What ? ! " the students exclaimed then they begun to chatter to each other . <p> Zaro sighed , " That 's for Miss Amaris but ... for her class .. it 's nearly impossible to think that they wont harm us. " he said . <p> " I know ... Do n't worry , the one who would be monitoring you is Sir Samuel . " Marisa said with a smile . <p> " Ah ... That would be fine then ... " Zaro sighed in relief . <p> " This would be a tough semester for us .. " Amanthea said in a whisper-like tone . <p> RUBY CLASS <p> " Ok ? ! Do n't hurt anyone , you can scratch them but not ' kill ' and do not injure any of them . If it 's an accident , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purpose , you 'll be punished by the Head Principal herself ! ! hey ! Janus , Phoenix ! You two ! Hear it well ? ? " Amaris asked the two . <p> Amaris giggles , " Janus , you know that Phoenix was never interested with anyone except that guy who he fought in the Tournament last time He 's only interested in strong people that can match with him " she told Janus . <p> Janus chuckled , " Ehehehe Yeah right But what if that girl matches up with his expectation or ... " he grins , " She 's more powerful than him ? " <p> " Eh ? That 's impossible ! Phoenix is the strongest in this Academy ! Well , the Head Principal is one , but for the students , it 's Phoenix for me " Amaris said gleefully . <p> Phoenix just stayed quiet while Janus is softly laughing . Amaris looked at the time , " Oh , break time You may now all go Remember to be on time for your Spar Classes ! " she told them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Garden Cafe with Ivor and Aryn . Ivor was complimenting the workers because of their excellent preparation , he was pretty amazed with the decorations of the Garden Cafe too . <p> " Kyaa Thank you , Ivor-sama " the workers said as they bow to Ivor . <p> " Now , now , he 's at it again ... " Aryn told them , watching Ivor . <p> Amanthea just sweatdrop then looks around the cafe , " But as Zaro said , this place is good and their snacks are great ! " she told them . <p> Zaro chuckled , " I know you 'll like it . A friend of mine/sister(*) is handling this Garden Cafe " he told her . <p> " Oh I see Ehehehe " Amanthea took a sip of their caramel honey tea , " Hm Sweet " <p> Ivor turned to her and pats her head , " Now , now , do n't get a sweet teeth " he told her . <p> " I wont " she replied . <p> Later on ... Spear and Blades Spar Class <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entered first but soon stopped . Confused , Amanthea peeked inside and saw Janus sitting on a barrel beside Phoenix . Janus noticed their arrival then runs to them , " Oiiii Amanthea " <p> " Eek ! " Amanthea flinched . <p> Zaro immediately brought his spear out and hits Janus on his head by using the handle of his spear . Janus ducks in return and grabs Amanthea 's hands . " Hey Wan na spar with me ? " Janus asked her . Phoenix just glanced at them then looks away . <p> Zaro glared at Janus , " Tsk ... Who would like to have a spar with yo-- " <p> " Yush ! You 'll be my partner for this day " Aryn exclaimed cheerly as he pinched his right ear and drags him away . <p> " Ow ow ow ! ! " Janus yelped while being taken away . <p> Zaro sighed and mutters , " Thanks Aryn , I owe you one . " he looks at Amanthea and asked , " Do you want to be my partner ? " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as she twirled her spear around her left hand . <p> The two went to an open space with their spears and they begun to spar with each other . Phoenix and the others were just watching them then later on , Samuel enters the room . <p> " Ahahaha As energetic as ever , I see Ok , come here ! The Head Principal have me a list of pairs which will be partners for the whole 5 years ! " Samuel told them then some students approached him . <p> When all students ha gathered around Samuel , he begun to tell them the new set of this semester 's partner assignments . <p> " Ok then , what the Head Principal did was ... A student from Sapphire Star will be partnered with a student from the Ruby Star Students . " Samuel told them while scanning the papers he got . <p> The students begun to chatter with each other , " What ? Seriously ? I wish I wont be partnered to either Janus or Phoenix ... " some of the Sapphire Star students muttered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a great idea We 'll take this chance to see their weaknesses so that we 'll have an advantage for the Monthly Tournament ! " they said with excitement . <p> " Do n't worry . The Superiors of each classes will hold responsible of major injuries , even if it 's just accidental . So do n't fight so much " Samuel told them in a serious tone . <p> Janus grinned under his mask , " Heh I wonder who will be my partner Hope it 's not Aryn ... " he said , Aryn just laughed . <p> Samuel cleared his throat , " So then , I 'll now announce who will be partners starting today " he flipped the papers to the first page , " Janus and Aryn . " <p> Aryn looked at Janus , grinning at him . " Say what now ? " he asked him . <p> Janus flinched , " WTH ? ? " <p> " Zaro and ... " Samuel continues to talk . <p> Amanthea waited until her name is called but it seems to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost everyone of them already have their partners , " Aryn and Zaro already have their partners ... " she said softly before sighing . <p> " And the last one ... Amanthea and Phoenix ! " Samuel exclaimed . <p> Zaro 's eyes widens , " W-What ? " <p> " W-With Phoenix ? " Amanthea asked Samuel as she went near him . <p> Zaro followed behind , " Can it be changed ? We can exchange partners ... " <p> Samuel sighed , " Sadly , no. " he told him then looked at Phoenix , " Oi Phoenix ! Be easy on her , ok ? No killing , no major wounds ! " he told him . <p> Phoenix slowly stood up , puts both of his hands on his pocket and grins at them , " I 'll try . " he said . <p> Zaro glared at him , " Tsk . Why does it have to be him of all people ? " he asked . <p> Samuel clapped his hands , getting their attention . " Ok , ok ! For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ An interview ! ! Seat on the bleachers or floor together with your partner ! You 'll do this for an hour or three ! " he said . <p> " Getting to know each other ? ! Is n't that like letting them know our weaknesses ? ? " Zaro told Samuel . <p> Samuel looked at him , " Hm ? If you want to tell them , Ahahaha What I mean by getting to know each other is just like a little self introduction . Ask for their name , age , favorites or anything ! Not really about your skills or abilities but if you want to tell them , why not ? " he explained . <p> Zaro stared at him with his unusual cold eyes , " Is it that important ? " he asked . <p> " Hm Yes ? I think . Since the Head Principal said so . " Samuel replied . <p> " Fine ... " Zaro walked back to Amanthea , " Be careful , ok ? You 'll be fine , I 'll stay near the both of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Amanthea nodded with a smile then goes to the bleacher where Phoenix is . Janus who was talking with Aryn , was also beside him . Amanthea goes to sit ont he same row but one seat away from Phoenix . Zaro was on the second row behind them . Janus looked at Amanthea and smirked . <p> Phoenix just stared at her then sighed , " Really ... ? It must be something important which is why you ca n't tell any of us ... right ? " he asked again , smirking . <p> " I-It 's not like that ... " Amanthea mumbled . <p> " Heh ... Then why wo n't you tell me ? " he asked . <p> Amanthea gulped and sighed , " ... Fine ... I 'll tell you ... " <p> Janus quickly turned to them and said , " Oh , oh ! I wan na know too ! ! " <p> " Hey ! " Aryn sighed . <p> " I ... I want to prove to my sister that a blade can also dance ... d-despite it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accompany you ... anywhere and ... anytime ... " Amanthea told Phoenix while trembling but in a serious tone . <p> The three blinked at her and stayed in an awkward silence . Amanthea looked down , blushing a bit . Phoenix suddenly snickered then looked at her with his curious and he seems fascinated with her answer . <p> " I see ... Show that to me later then . " Phoenix told her . <p> " Oh oh He became interested in you " Janus told Amanthea . <p> Amanthea blushed , " I-Interested ? " <p> Phoenix sighed , " Your power ... It 's seems ' something ' and unique than the other spear users here ... " he replied while looking around . <p> " Oh ... " Amanthea stayed quiet again , but not noticing his glance to her . <h> Chapter 3 ; part 2 <p> part 2 <p> 2nd Periodpoor fighting scenes coming x.x <p> " Yush ! For our second period ... Defense ! The Sapphire Star Students have to attack and the Ruby Star Students have to block . Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it with your weapon , got it ? ? This is to enhance your skill on how you defend yourselves . We will spend an hour for this then another hour for the Sapphire Star Student 's turn to defend . " Samuel told them . " You can start ! " <p> Amanthea charged at Phoenix with her spear ready but as she tries to hit him , Phoenix just blocks her attack with ease . For Janus and Aryn 's side , Aryn was giving his all by slamming his broad sword at Janus . " Hey-- Not so har- WAIT- " Janus said while blocking each of his attacks . Aryn just laughed and continued to give him large slams . <p> " So where 's the dance ? " Phoenix asked Amanthea , smirking . <p> Amanthea just focuses on her attacks but soon her footsteps begun to change but Phoenix can still read her next moves . Zaro had been attacking his partner nonstop then his partner suddenly tripped backwards . <p> " Owh . " He mumbled . <p> Zaro lend out a hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Y-Yeah ... Thanks , Zaro. " he replied then looked at Amanthea and Phoenix'es place . " That new girl ... She have an interesting way of fighting using her spear " he said chuckling . <p> Zaro also watched and smiled , " You 're right ... " <p> Amanthea had been twirling around Phoenix while sending sneaky attacks . Phoenix smirked and continues to defend himself . <p> " So this is what you mean ... " Phoenix said then as he blocked another attack , he purposely threw her spear away . " Oops , reflexes . " <p> " Ehh .. " Amanthea went to pick it up then attacks Phoenix again . <p> Phoenix goes to block it then throws it again . <p> " Hey ! Are you doing that on purpose ? ? " Amanthea asked him , eye-twitching . <p> Phoenix watched her grab the spear , " You better change the way on how you hold your spear or else you wont be able to block my attacks later . " he told her in a serious tone . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " Woah the time seems fast . " Aryn said . <p> Janus chuckled , " I can finally return the attacks you gave me Hehehe " he told Aryn . <p> Zaro stops and looks at Amanthea , his partner stopped too and asked , " Are you worried ? " <p> " AH , yes ... A bit . " Zaro replied . <p> " She 'll be fine , I guess . " he told him with a smile . <p> " I hope so ... Let 's continue . " Zaro said as he turns back to him and continued their fight . <p> The spar between Amanthea and Phoenix continues and he had been throwing her spear several times already . He sighed and grabs her spear as it landed on him . <p> Phoenix speaks in an undertone , " You 're stubborn . I 'm already telling you some tips . " <p> " I ... I do n't have to change what I 've work hard for ! I 'll just have to improve it ! " Amanthea exclaimed as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charged at Amanthea and slammed his spear as hard as he can , she was able to block it but was pushed a bit . Phoenix send out another attack and this time , she was n't able to hold it and got flew off to a wall . <p> Zaro 's eyes widens , " A-Amanthea ! " he exclaimed as he watch her hit the wall . <p> " Oh , I did not expect that . " his partner muttered . <p> Zaro 's call made Amanthea return back to her senses . She grabbed her spear and stabbed it on the ground as she stood up . Samuel goes to approach Phoenix while Zaro rushed to Amanthea . <p> " Hey , did n't I tell you to be easy on her ? She 's also a new student here ! " Samuel told Phoenix . <p> " Are you ok ? Are you inju- " Zaro 's eyes widens as he saw that Amanthea does n't have any injuries , " Huh ... ? You are n't hurt ? " he asked . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hit the wall ... " Amanthea replied . <p> Zaro looked at the wall where the huge crack is , " But that 's too impossible ... And .. Are you sure you did n't hit the wall ? Where is this crack from then ? " he asked her . <p> " Ah ... ahm .. a bit of the force ? Ehehe .. " Amanthea giggled softly , " I 'm fine , ok ? Do n't worry , Zaro. " she told him with a smile . <p> Zaro sighed and smiled , " If you say so ... Be careful ... " he replied . <p> Samuel looked at her , " Great , you 're not injured . Can you still continue ? " he asked , she nodded . <p> Phoenix smirked , " Good , that 's just good . This means I can use my full power without her getting hurt , hm ? " he said . <p> " Oi , oi . That might just be a coincidence or luck ! " Samuel said . <p> Amanthea walked back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told Samuel . <p> " Are you sure ? The next hit might hurt you for real . " Samuel replied in an alarming tone . <p> Amanthea begun to change the way she defends herself . She begun moving around but not avoiding the spear . She 's blocking each attacks and then swings her spear on the sides to bring Phoenix'es spear in a different direction . This movement soon turned so swiftly and smoothly as if she 's dancing with Phoenix . He clicked his tongue and Janus saw it . <p> " Uh-oh Phoenix is annoyed I hope he wont snap like last time ... " Janus said . <p> " What are you talking about ? Come on and be serious , man ! " Aryn told him . <p> Samuel looked at the time , " 10 minutes left . " <p> Phoenix suddenly stopped and withdraws his spear . Amanthea looked at him with a confused look . <p> " Let 's stop for now . " Phoenix told her as he headed for the bleachers and sits . <p> Samuel chuckles , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can go . But expect tomorrow that we 'll have a tough training , ok ? ! That 's up for tonight ! See you tomorrow ! " he told them before leaving . <p> The students cheered and prepared to leave . <p> + " " + ( To be continued ... ) + " " + <p> - * - tbh , I 'm still confirming Eve 's relationship with Zaro . At first , I paired them then a certain friend of mine said that they were siblings =w= <h> Chapter 4 ; part 1 <p> Amanthea walked out of her dorm at early in the morning to jog for awhile . While jogging , she decided to warm up behind the Girl 's Dorm while listening to some music . <p> " One , two . One , two . One , two , three . Up , right , down left . Turn and spin-- " as soon as she spins around , she saw Janus hanging upside down on a branch of a tree . " Eek ? ! " she stumbled backwards and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Good morning How are ya ? " he asked . <p> " I 'm good-- NOT THAT ! Why are you here in the Girl 's Dorm ? ? " Amanthea asked him as she stood . <p> " I 'm not in I 'm outside So it 's fine " Janus told her as he went down and dusts himself . " Never knew you 'll be awake at this kind of time " <p> " Same thing for you ... " she muttered . <p> Janus grins , " Me ? I 'm always early like this " he told her in a playful-like tone , " So how 's your fight-- I mean , defense with Phoenix ? " he asked . <p> Amanthea sighed , " It 's fine and he 's strong too . " <p> " Heh Do you think you can handle him for the whole school semester ? " Janus asked her while looking around on their surrounding . <p> Amanthea stretches her arms upwards and said , " Maybe . I 'll try . " <p> " Not backing up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyebrow , " Is that all you 're here for ? " <p> " Nope " Janus smirks and attacks her . <p> Amanthea quickly dodged and clicked her tongue . She quickly grab her spear and blocked his incoming attack . <p> " I like the fact that fighting here is n't prohibited " Janus said while grinning . <p> He prepares another strong blow to her but Amanthea was able to step back and block him . He quickly draws back and gives out a strong kick on her left , she was able to stop it with her left arm but ... <p> " Ow Was that a crack ? " Janus asked as he walks back , but he was wearing a sinister smile . <p> Amanthea holds his arm then flinches in pain , " H-Hnn ... Sorry ... That was stupid of me ... " <p> Janus chuckles , " I should be the one saying sorry " he told her as he hid his weapon . <p> Amanthea glared at him , " ... What are you really planning ? " <p> Janus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said then he walked away . <p> " H-Hey ! " Amanthea sighed and looks at her left arm . " This is bad ... How can I hide it ... ? " <p> Later on in Marisa 's Class <p> " The training later would be different than yesterday . " Zaro told Amanthea . <p> Ivor was behind Amanthea , fixing her hair . " But being paired up with that Phoenix guy seems like a pain . " <p> Amanthea covered her left arm with a bandage and placed a bit of ointments . She have long sleeves so it 's not so obvious that she hurt her left arm . " Hehehe Well ... As long as I 'll be careful , I 'll be fine right ? " she asked them . <p> " Nah It 's still 5 minutes before class " Aryn replied with a bright smile . <p> Ivor pats Amanthea 's head as he finished fixing her hair , " There . " <p> " Ah , thanks " she smiled . <p> " Ah and one more thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spar Class , would you two join us again ? Fina and those two ... " Zaro looked at Azusa and Sakura , " ... will be coming too . " he told the two guys . <p> " Oh sure " Ivor replied . <p> Aryn chuckled , " I 'll try ! " <p> " Ok , we 'll meet there then " Zaro said with a smile . <p> Aryn soon went back to his seat , same as Ivor . Marisa then arrived and asked them about their first day with the Ruby Students . After getting their answers , she started with a new lesson . <p> Amaris ' Class <p> " Hm hm hm " Janus was just listening to Amaris ' lectures . <p> Phoenix glanced at him , " You seems to be in a good mood . " Janus just gave out a soft giggle . <p> Amaris suddenly threw a chalk on Janus but he caught it with his two fingers , " Stop with your creepy laugh while I 'm discussing ! " <p> " Sorry , sorry " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Amaris sighed and looked at Phoenix , " has he gone mad ? Phoenix , watch over him before he do something crazy . " <p> " He 'll be fine . He 's been like this ever since . " he answered , looking away . <p> Janus glanced at her and grins . Samuel told them to do 10 laps jog and they can either do it outside or inside , 50 counts for sit ups and 30 counts of Jumping Jacks . He also told them that they will be doing this kind of exercise every first period of their class . After some more discussions , Samuel told them to start and just go back when they finished . All of them went with their partners outside to exercise . The ones who were left inside were Aryn and Janus , Zaro and his partner , Phoenix and Amanthea and 2 other pairs . <p> " Hey , hey Let 's all jog together " Aryn told them . <p> " Sure , that would be great . " Zaro looked at his partner , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nodded . <p> " I wont mind " Janus replied in a cheerful tone . <p> Phoenix sighs , " Whatever . " <p> " Ok then , let 's go . " Zaro told them . <p> The six of them begun jogging ; Zaro 's partner , Janus and Phoenix were just behind them . Samuel watches from afar then looks at Amanthea . He scratched his head and sighed . <p> " Seriously ... Not telling me that she 's injured . " Samuel muttered then walked out of the room . He went straight to Magic Class . " Heya girls " <p> Zaro just finished his sit ups with his partner then looks at the trio but could not hear what they were talking about . Samuel examined the wound and found out that it still fresh so he asked where she got the injury . <p> " Sit down for awhile and answer me . " Samuel told her , arms crossed . <p> Amanthea nodded and sat down , Fina took out some ointments and a small wand . She started treating her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .. did someone do this to you ? " Samuel asked when he realized that Amanthea does n't even want to speak about it . <h> Chapter 4 ; part 2 <p> " 30 right ? Let 's continue . " Amanthea said as she sits in front of him . <p> Phoenix looks at her then glances to her injury . <p> " Phoenix ? " she called , blinking . <p> Phoenix closed his eyes , " I did the last 20 by myself . " <p> " Eh ? " <p> He looks at her again , " You took so long , that 's why . The others are already doing their jumping jacks . Hurry and do your sit ups . " <p> " Oh ... Ok . " Amanthea does her sit ups while Phoenix is holding her feet in place , looking away . <p> Later on , Amanthea finished her sit ups then both of them did their 30 jumping jacks . After their exercise , all students returned inside then later on they were dismissed to have their break time . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Garden Cafe . In Amanthea 's surprise , the girl who treated her injury was the friend who Zaro was talking about earlier . <p> " Oh So you are the new student ... I did not notice since I was not present during the first day . Ah ! I 'm Fina by the way . " Fina told Amanthea as she lend her hand for a hand shake . <p> Amanthea smiles and hand shakes with her , " Nice meeting you then , thank you too for earlier . " <p> Zaro looks at Amanthea 's left arm , " That Janus ... Tsk . Why would he do that ? " <p> Sakura fans herself and said to them , " Obviously wanted to see what she can do with a broken arm . " <p> Zaro stared at her , " Really now ... " <p> " But are you ok now ? " Azusa asked Amanthea as she took a sip from her jasmine tea . <p> " Ah yes . It 's all thanks to Fina 's magic and ointments . " Amanthea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Phoenix and Janus were just on the roof top . Phoenix was just lying down , as is napping while Janus was scratching the ground with his dagger and it seems like he is irritated . <p> " Tsk , I did n't realize that Samuel would notice her ... Tsk ... " Janus mumbled then he stabbed the dagger on the ground . <p> " What are you so mad about ? " Phoenix asked , staying in his position . <p> Janus glares at the dagger , " Tsk ... Train her WELL . " he told him . <p> Phoenix sighed " Fine " and thought , " A pissed off Janus again huh ... " <p> Second Period of Spears and Blade Class <p> Samuel waited till all students are in before he start his discussion , " For our second period , our real training will begin . This is also called as Spar Period and by it 's name , I know you guys have the idea of how this period will be done . Since this is the first day for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he glanced at janus and Phoenix , " Specially for the both of you . " <p> Janus smiled carelessly , " Ok " but Phoenix just stayed quiet . <p> " Ok , you can start ! ! " Samuel exclaimed then went to sit beside the door . <p> Amanthea pats her left arm , " Ok ... I can still do this-- " her eyes widens as she felt something coming towards her and moved her spear as an instinct of blocking Phoenix'es attack . " H-Hey ! " <p> Phoenix ignored her remark and continued to hit her again . <p> " Ack- W-Wait ! Can you stop for awhile-- " Amanthea asked while blocking each of his attacks . <p> Phoenix slams his spear against hers and used the chance to throw her spear away before giving out another strong attack . Amanthea was able to dodge it and quickly ran towards her spear to grab it but ... As soon as she reaches for it , Phoenix appears behind her and kicks her out of the way . Zaro heard a bump on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was Amanthea . <p> " Amanthea ! " <p> Samuel heard the commotion and looks at them , he glared at Phoenix , " Hey ! Did n't I warn you before ? ! " he exclaimed as he run towards them but Aryn was suddenly thrown on him . <p> " Huk-- Hey ! " Aryn glared at Janus . <p> " Arg , Janus ! " Samuel pushed Aryn . <p> Janus just snickered , " Ehehehe Sorry " <p> Phoenix looked down at Amanthea and raises his spear to strike an attack to her but before the spear hits Amanthea , Marisa and Amaris appeared and blocked his spear with their staff . Phoenix flinched and stepped away , looking at the two Superiors . <p> Amaris clicked her tongue , " Tsk ... The Head Master was right . Seriously , I 'll be dead if you 'll kill her during the Spar Period SPECIALLY ! For the first day of this period ... " she said with a sigh . <p> Marisa turned to Amanthea , " Are you ok ? Can you stand ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , looking at Phoenix . <p> " Oh good , you 're not injured . Such luck you got there . " Amaris said in a relief . <p> Phoenix was about to speak but before he could , Amaris slapped him . The others were shocked , they know NO ONE can do that to Phoenix . They expected Phoenix to fight back but he did n't . Instead , he felt silent and his face darkens . <p> Amaris gave out a big sigh , " Phoenix , please follow the rules at least once ... " but he just looked away . <p> " Those eyes again ... " Amanthea said to herself while looking at Phoenix'es eyes . <p> " Did ... Janus told you to do this ? " Amaris asked him but he still stayed quiet . Amaris'es eyes twitches , " JANUS ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! " he roared as she turned to where Janus is . <p> Janus sneakily walks away but Amaris threw her staff like a spear and hits Janus in the head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unconscious and mini Amaris circles around his head-- <p> Amaris sighed and looks at Samuel , " I 'll take care of him . " then turned to Phoenix again , " Phoenix ... You do n't have to follow his orders . I 've told you that a lot of times . " then carries Janus and picks up her staff . " I 'm sorry about this ... " She quickly turned to Marisa , pouting , " I-I 'm only doing this for Phoenix , ok ? ! " and walks away carrying Janus . <p> " Ow , what a tsun " Marisa said with a smile then turns to Amanthea , " Let me see ... Hmm ... There ! " she muttered after healing Amanthea 's bruises , " Now as for you , huh- Where did Phoenix go ? " 
@@23370480 @3370480/ 21183 @qwx221183 <h> Eidolon Linking <p> Hi guys , i 'm fairly new to Aura Kingdom and have a few questions about Eidolon Linking that I ca n't seem to figure out for myself . If you have any links to guides that may seem helpful for me then link them please ! : ) <p> My first question is : <p> Do certain eidolons give rarer gifts than others ? <p> For example , let 's say I got a 3-star Serena . Since she 's a higher rank of eidolon does that mean I have a better chance of obtaining rarer items like key frags and evolutionary crytals ? I would also like to know if eidolons drop wearable accessories like costumes or hairs . I wonder this since I see items like Serena 's hair or Kotonoha 's hair band thing . I 'm aware those items are purchasable in the item mall but i 'm curious to know whether or not this is possible . <p> I noticed that my eidolon will take a few points or 10 points ( that 's the max i 've seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Does this effect anything ? And what 's the max amount of points they will take ? Should I have a lot of points saved up for my eidolon before I make these links ? <p> That 's pretty much all I want to know . I could n't find anything on the forums that helped me out with these questions so i 'm hoping the experience players can help me out a bit c ; <p> No , Eidolon will only give you their Key Fragments and EXP Crystals . Costumes are from Paragon , Item Mall , Loyalty Shop , etc . As for whether having a 3-star makes a slight difference , it probably does n't . <p> If you 're talking about the number value that increases when you talk to them , that 's just required for you to link them . If you do n't have any points , you ca n't link ( simple stuff ) . As far as I know , it makes no difference either . You can only store up to 99 points , which makes no difference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a link . <p> ? It all comes down to the last person you think of at night . That 's where your heart is ? <p> I 've tried it both ways , plenty of times , and it does n't seem to impact the odds of getting keys gifted . I 've had about as many keys gifted from linking at 90+ as I have from 20- , so it certainly seems like it 's just plain random . <p> And with the card battle system added , they do occasionally return with a copy of their card battle card , in addition to the fragments , crests , and experience crystals that they 've always given . Some costumes can also come from the special currency NPC shops ( **29;11520;TOOLONG ) , as well as the ones that come for free when you evolve an Eidolon to 3 Stars ( regardless of whether or not you 've unlocked their 3 Star stat bonuses ) . <p> @CELESTI I was wondering what those cards were for when I got two from my Serif ( I got Serif and Alessa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the special NPC shops , i 'll look into that since I do a lot of Archaeology . 
@@23370481 @3370481/ <p> Hiya ! I 'm new to the server . But I could n't find any information about how the server handles the Item Mall .

But yet , I see people on level 20 having a full costume , and I have n't got anything .

The loyalty store generally has most of needed consumables to play available , and a nice variety of fashion items and limited promotions . You can farm Loyalty throught the game .

If you have the trade channel open you will see people often giving stuff away pretty frequently . After that , like everyone has mentioned , if you play a few hours casually daily you 'll get around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tries on the paragon table . If you 're lucky , you can get really valuable stuff and you can sell it for a lot of gold , then buy yourself what strikes your fancy . <p> SukkerroeAya <p> 10-30-2015 , 01:50 PM <p> To your info : The usual rates of exchange are 1 AP = 1 Gold ; 1 BP = 2 Gold . The most expensive costume in the shop is around 1700 gold . Everything on this server is easy to obtain . 1700 gold could be 300 dungeons . Or you use paragon-tables prices of the lowest 3 rows . Sell those for 100-200 gold . That is by far the easiest way to make money .

People check gear not gear score .... well good people anyways . <p> Dawn1123 <p> 06-21-2014 , 11:24 PM <p> To put things in perspective , I +15 'd my level 60 114% crafted sub weap yesterday from +9 and gained 16k GS , when I was +15'ing my armour it was giving me 5k GS just from +14-15 , so getting GS is fairly easy . <p> GS is almost meaningless though , you can have really high GS but not be experienced in anything and still die a tonne ( ST would be a good example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a combination of experience ( or at least ability to learn quickly/dodge things , obviously to get experience you have to run things , so it 's sort of iffy ) and some minimum stats to know that they will be effective .

A skilled player who knows what to do when , could even do the same or better then someone with max GS who just raised his secret stones . <p> Sliko <p> 06-23-2014 , 06:26 PM <p> Does Gear Score Affect ur gamplay ? i mean just the number of your gear score , will it add anything to ur gameplay , of course it does n't  , if there well tell me , cause if it does n't  , that it means its just to show off , i do n't  think people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is like the Rich with bad work , and the poor with better work than the Rich guy

@@23370491 @3370491/ 21183 @qwx221183 <h> General Clarification <p> Since a lot of people has been asking this privately , I decided to make a public thread so you can all know what is going on . Hope it solves everyone 's doubts ! <p> Many people is wondering about the date of our next maintenance , and mostly , if its going to be this week . The answer to that question is NO . There 's no exact date on when the next maintenance will take place , but its very likely it will by next week ( between Thursday and Friday ) . The beta test , that should have started between Wednesday and Friday of past week , actually started this Monday . The reason behind the delayed beginning of the beta test was related to the new client ; although the test server was already working by past Thursday it took a few more days to get the new client up a running . Despite of the started day of the testing process ; it was highly unlikely in any scenario the actual maintenance could have took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing ? We have been , of course , testing the new content and checking everything is working as suppose to . The bright side ? The beta has been smoothly so far , in fact ( and considering the amount of content we are adding ) it has been one of the best-going betas we had . No major or game-breaking bugs were reported . But that does n't mean there have n't been any errors . Some problems can always me expected , and the dev is currently working to fix them all . <p> Not only the client needs to be working and the bugs must be fix , but adding new content also means translating new stuff . Its a process that it also takes time , reason why it would n't have been possible to begin with to add all the content in the time frame of 1 week . So what is missing ? There 's only a few more bugs to fix and a few additions we are missing , like the extra creation slots and the new laments ( something we also want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is done , translations are over , and a final test takes place , we will be ready to have the maintenance . And , repeating myself , is possible it happens between Thursday and Friday of Next Week . <p> So what exactly will be coming ? This is another question people have been asking me often . The two biggest additions of new patch will be the new class ( which we have already resign to name it PersonSword , and will be known very likely as " Crusader " because I wo n't ever hear the end of it from Ayasel if we do n't ) and the weapon specs . Both of them have been tested , and minus some minor fixes , seems to be working just fine . The 4th skill bar will also be a part of the next patch , and there are two new hairstyles for each gender . Several game fixes will also be included with the patch ; some minor as the price of pvp weapons to set an example , some more noticeable . Right now -as said- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oblitus Wood new laments , which will mean new level 75 armors . This have n't been tested just yet . And is in our intentions to also add the extra slots to create characters in your accounts . <p> Now , another question I 've been getting this week ( mostly ) if its we are still going to change the Paragon Table this week , even if we do n't add the content , and of course why we would n't . In order to change the Paragon Table , there are some upcoming new items that also needs to be added to the game . We can not add the items and leave the content out , it would be a messy process and we do n't have the time for it right now , since our dev must focus on getting the content ready first . <p> So Paragon Table will indeed change , more than likely next week . with this patch . The same applies to the Dragon Coins Bar , so if you are waiting to exchange your prices you will have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another burning question ) they will be added gradually to the game . They have n't been tested yet neither I can confirm you they are working , but the plans are to add Uriel with this patch . <p> Hope this have solve some of the questions ; as for any other content that is n't specify in this thread I have n't talk about it because those are things we will be still working on the upcoming weeks , until we finally see most of it . The eidolon Prayer system , is the only thing that will possible be added with the next patch but there 's also a small chance it takes a little longer . <p> Eidolon Prayer is a new way to get permanent stats for your characters ( like Title bonuses , they 're account wide bonuses ) . Basically , you need to complete 6 quest for each Eidolon . In each quest they 're gon na ask you for different items , it could be fishing mats , crafted gear , pvp gear , transformation tools , etc . The stats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it adds up so it becomes an amount that can not be ignored . <p> If you want to prepare for it , save 5 key fragments of each Eidolon you have . Last quest for every Eidolon asks for x100 Eidolon Energy Crystal and x5 key fragments .

I 've wanted the Serena fash since it came out but only recently got it in Auction during the Christmas sales . I was originally going to try to use light blue dye as the main color but I ended up changing it to normal white and red + just some blue . Considering it was Serena , I added the Cynthia moon cause I thought the back needed something cute for the holidays I mainly wanted something Christmassy for that whole time because I was a secret santa for friends plus it was just so adorable I had to : 3 LONG ... <p> On a gloomy mid April day a brave little Fluff rushes to school to learn about Azuria the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what would be a school day without a proper school girl outfit and Fluff knows it , she looks so good in it ! *pose for the camera* Selfie is needed ! <p> http : **25;12276;TOOLONG <p> On the days when Fluff does n't have to study she likes to chill in guild hall .

LONG ... <p> During the month of June , the former guild leader decided to have an eidolon look a like guild event for fun and more screenshots ... hehe XD I became a grown up version of Endora ( I do n't like Endora 's clothing costume so I just recolour my uniform to fit her colour theme ) LONG ... LONG ... <p> Got my new Custom Traditional Summer Kimono on July on auction house before it was put up on LP shop . I liked this kimono over the long version one because its cuter &gt;. &lt; I dyed the summer hair or kotonoha hair crimson red because its more pleasing to my eyes instead of matching it to the kimono . OO LONG ... LONG ... <p> In the course of these months , I started to collect more costumes than I had anticipated @#@ . And so begins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ * dilemma . Starting from here , these outfits are worn during November but I 'll select my favorites XD Weiss Schnee look a like ? no ? okay ...... kinda going for Snow White theme just because IM BORED ! ! LONG ... LONG ... <p> Finally , of all clothes that I have worn only one that is truly my favourite , the Aura Kingdom uniform ! My current look and took this screenshot on 1st January 2015 at 9.03 pm &lt; ... why so specific ? hahahaha ! ; ) Just so u know , I hide face accessories and wings most of the time because it is f***ing distracting me ! : mad : LONG ... LONG ... <p> Kitty <p> 01-02-2015 , 12:36 PM <p> - You can make a new layout to show us the screens , but their quality ca n't be modified or external elements added . <p> Can someone clarify this ? ; n ; Are we allowed to design borders and things or does that fall under external elements ? Or does that mean stuff like no editing lighting and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am sorta confused by Aura 's post and then the varying submissions . &gt;&lt; ; <p> -- <p> MaidKitty 's Style Evolution <p> I know some of these are n't the greatest of quality but there 's some sort of nostalgic feel to see your character grow . n It 's fun looking at all the entries too ! <p> June 13th - One of my first couple of days on Ak.to ! I remember the FIRST thing I did was open the item mall , and then my jaw dropped at the prices xD I joined originally with a friend , but I wanted to try out the server so I created MaidKitty &amp; promptly bought her a matching outfit . hehe . Anxiously waited to find cat ears . http : **25;13311;TOOLONG <p> -- ? -- <p> June 18th - A screenshot of many things to be excited about ! The cat ears were too expensive for me ; n ; but I got the matching headband instead . It was around this time that EcchiCafe was originally formed and I brought a buncha friends over from OS . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> -- ? -- <p> June 28th - I found the fashion contest on the forums around this time . I only had one or two outfits but I loved them so I decided to give it a shot ! I tried many parings but I liked this one the most because of the lighting pose , and how hq it looked to me. nwn http : **25;13365;TOOLONG <p> -- ? -- <p> July 15th - Odd gaps in my timeline , hehe . When I like a certain outfit I tend to stick to it like glue . I took this after finishing a GC run . I wanted to try the location for a the screenshot contest entry . Athena was cheering me on , as I got frustrated from spending hours in the dungeon trying to get the perfect jump timing and align my character with the flashing light . http : **25;13392;TOOLONG <p> -- ? -- <p> August 6th - " Please do n't stare at my pantsu ! " Haha . This was a couples outfit my bf and I did together . http : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! The excitement level is over through the roof ! Won a forum competiton and got the cutest little Santa Outfit . Totally had to dye it and take screenshots ! nwn http : **25;13446;TOOLONG <p> -- ? -- <p> November 11th - Went MIA from the game for awhile because of personal health . ; Came back to a super cute paragon and I HAD to nab this outfit ! I was sad to find it was n't dyeable , but so cute nonetheless . http : **25;13473;TOOLONG <p> I 'm currently recycling old favourite outfits ! ? but 2014 has been so kind to our fashion possibilities . Here 's to another year of creative outfits ! <p> Rivaster <p> 01-02-2015 , 02:54 PM <p> Rivaster 's Style Evolution More like oh boy I have been playing this game for too long and therefore I have worn too many costumes <p> My first style is just me coming from humble beginnings . I 've been here since the start of the server and ... let 's face it . There were not many great style choices back then when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considered the best thing ever back then , but I will always love my first costume here which looked pretty stylish to me . This was back when I had normal short hair too , so there 's that . Bards were also rare gods in the beginning because there were so few , so I had a pretty easy ride when everyone would call upon me for dungeons and whatnot . <p> I just could n't keep to the short hair for long though . After receiving one of those character change items , I messed with it and fell in love with the long ponytail hair . To me it was the coolest thing ever in a world of boy characters trying to look edgy and cool with their short hair . I believe this costume was the first custom costume promotion to appear in the loyalty shop as well , not counting the beginner custom costumes . It looked so cool to me and it gave me a chinese-type feeling . <p> This is when I really started to fall in love with my character . After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few had been allowed a choice of two costume items for participating ! Or , er , one if you just wanted a costume weapon . There was no such thing as costume weapons back then , so some of us made profit on that kind of thing . One of the participants and I instantly asked for a santa suit . We wanted something special that was n't in the server yet after all , and would n't be for a long time . And so , I became some sort of innocent and fragile looking snow demon who flaunted their santa suit daily . <p> Okay I 'll admit it . I might have gone through a phase where everything needed to be dyed pink . EVERYTHING . As soon as a costume came out on the server ? Dyed it coral pink . Always . This is only one example of many where pink was all the rage and people questioned the gender of my character . Needless to say , every single person I met was shocked when I took my top off of my character @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . No matter how many times I change my clothes , santa suit has always called upon me . This was taken when the beautiful harp costume weapon was finally released and I just had to take a screenshot . Oh and blush accessories had come out too . There was a definite need to keep my boy as cute as possible . <p> I decided to try and become a cool male for once and decided that cool shades were in . No one could possibly question the gender of my character then ! I thought I would stick to this set for awhile too and therefor put in a bunch of costume cards into these clothes . But you know ... my style never stays the same for long . <p> Oh lordy I finally won one of those costume contests and I immediately asked for that top and hat piece . There were no custom blue ribbons yet after all and I decided that the color blue needed to be used more often . I 'm pretty sure the body costume was n't released either , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so perfectly with my costume weapon that I immediately fell in love with this new attire . Ca n't forget the blush though . Blush is forever needed . <p> By this time I had sort of been taking a break from the game because I 've kind of been here ... for a good long time . I would only occasionally get on for sky tower or just to hang with friends . Things are becoming tougher in the world and I 've been a lazy butt who 's been stuck at level 66 for some time . But when my friends are all online at the same time and a new costume has come out in paragon ? This had been one of the lesser wanted items on the paragon , but we did n't care . It looked pretty damn fine on us and even better when we dyed it completely white . I 'm the one with the cool hair on the left if you could n't tell . <p> Finally ... I FINALLY decided to change my hair color , if only to match the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if I would change my hair style though . This is my current and final appearance as of this moment and I would like to say I will stick to this style for quite awhile . Hah ... I 'm sure some other costume will catch my attention sooner or later though . <p> aichan <p> 01-03-2015 , 02:51 AM <p> http : **29;13500;TOOLONG <p> Welcome Envoys of Gaia ! Fashion Style is an art of self expression . <p> Hi , I 'm ai of Renaissance . I like to show you one of my favorite fashion collection since I first played Aura Kingdom . <p> LONG ... Presenting to you my masterpiece ... <p> It was Summer Edition on Peragon Table when I got first to play Aura Kingdom . Luckily , I 've got Summer Festival Yukata and Summerly Hairstyle from gambling ( yay ! xD ) . This scenery is one of my favorite places in AK and it is located at Former site of Lunarin Village @ Crescent Hill . Flowers are blooming there ! ? ? ? ? ? ? ? <p> Pink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep up my Loyalty Points is just for the cute costumes . hearts ! Back then , I was spamming dungeons and questing to level up ( The Training Days &gt;. &lt; ) . This was taken in front of Wrathborne Temple in Ventos Prairie . There are huge irregular structures that made the scene looks fantastic . <p> I will let you feel now how magical the aura in Rainmist Reach ! ( stars twinkling ) Cute mushrooms ! I am a Light Fairy Princess who will guide you to your chosen path And as Thinkerbell always says , " All you need is Faith and Thrust and a little bit of Pixie Dust . " <p> Boo ! Beware of an orange spirit who lurks around the Crescent Hill ! ( xD ) No , I 'm not that scary enough . The autumn trees made us feel happy and relaxing . Just remember to smile if you see them on your way to Temple of Eidelons . Do me a favor . : 3 Smile ! <p> LONG ... <p> http : **29;13531;TOOLONG <p> LONG ... . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : . <p> I usually dance when I afk a little bit . xD More often in Navea ! I must say sorry to you in advance if you think I have ignored you D : Back to the topic ! I finally got my Evening Gown ( yay : D ) I love all the dresses . The feeling of being like a princess is ... wonderful ! : D <p> Feel the rage on my arrows ! : p I 'm wearing Sniper 's Suit that drops from Sky Tower . Trying to look like Maleficent : cool : but i fail on horns D : anyway ... Everytime we battle or duel with another person ( must be a friend or frenemies ! ) and then we lost D : ( cries ) It makes us motivated to be stronger than them . So what are you waiting now ? Go and gear up now ! <p> Wow ! Everyone must love this beautiful scenery . It is because you can see the Rainbows , the Waterfalls ( so relaxing ) , and Mountains ! Also , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I just realized the place was just through the fishing area . hahaha xD <p> This is my fashion journey throught my stay here in AKPS . I started playing here around March 2014 ( I started with male toons but I deleted them coz I always dress them like girls , sadly I can not recreate the male toon 's looks anymore coz Ialready have 8 female toons ) , and from that point on I have met a lot of nice people , and of course , a lot of fashionistas . It 's really nice to have them around , especially if you need to consult if a costume looks good on you , or if the colors look alright , or if your wings fit your costume . Lots of people in the game really like dressing up , and I 'm definitely not an exception . <p> Here are some of my most loved costumes from the time I started until now . <p> May 2014 - Bard ( formerly named NyxAnastasis ) LONG ... LONG ... This is the very first costume set I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LP shop during that time and this is one of my most favored costumes of all time . I used it for quite some time . I believe I was playing here for about 1 or 2 months already I think ? This was also the very first entry I made for the Fashiaholic event . <p> June 2014 - Bard ( formerly named NyxAnastasis ) LONG ... LONG ... Afterwards , I went for a more " battle Fairy " look with Thunder Dragon 's Armor ( F ) , one of the best costumes for me . Not too girly , not too " armor-like " . If you have this costume dyed all white and you go to Navea with high brightness , it really really glows and sparkles ! It was my dream costume back in OS . I have 4 of these for different toons . About 6 dyes on it total , 3 of them with full enchant ( orange+green ) . This was the third entry I made for the Fashiaholic event and the first one I won ! <p> July 2014 - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When custom evening gown came out , I really tried my best to get it via LP . I remember a lot of people asking what 's so nice about that big hipped costume , but I loved it ! I also tried this costume with different colors that match different back costumes . This is a screenie I took when the butterfly fairy wings came out . <p> July 2014 - Recreated look LONG ... LONG ... Then came these costumes , totally angelic , and I really wanted to have an angelic feel to my toon , hence , this setup . Originally , these costumes were only available via AP shop , and worse , inside a fortune pack ! I was almost certain during that time that I wont get my hands on these ... Until ... they became available elsewhere ! This is one of the costumes that does n't completely dye in all parts , but it really suits a lot of back costumes well , given you choose the right dyes for it . <p> July 2014 - Sorcerer ( formerly named NyxAmbrosia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ angel look , complete with a matching Dark Fire Fox Mount . I just love how the black and gold matches together , I 'd say these two colors are made to be forever good looking together . The costume btw is Black Dragon Armor ( F ) and Abyss Evil Wings . The evolution to the next look required the same costume , but the look is really different . <p> July 2014 - Sorcerer ( formerly named NyxAmbrosia ) LONG ... LONG ... And like the story of a fallen angel , my toon 's look changed from a dark angel to a succubus with this set of Black Dragon Armor ( F ) and the Wings of Doom . This is perhaps my favorite setup , it 's just so complete ! I submitted this for a fashiaholic event and I was lucky I won since there were a lot of good entries that time too ! It took me A LOT of times taking screenies , and this one I was able to get with the help of Heca . This was the last entry I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again ( mainly coz it 's so tiring to take 300 or more screenies before you can capture a shot you like lol ) . Also , after this , I went on hiatus because I had to start for a new job and was very very busy irl . <p> August 2014 - wizard ( piloted by my cousin andie aka Sadie here in forums ) LONG ... LONG ... Now along came the Queen Fairy Wings , my favorite back costume of all time . The body costume is one of the few " free " costumes I actually really liked , mainly because the way it dyes is perfect for the queen fairy wings . My cousin was piloting the account during the time this screenie was taken , but nevertheless , the concept came from me &gt;. &lt; In fact , I was n't playing during this time but I forced him to wear the costumes that I prefer for each of my toons . He grinded for gold , I forced him to buy the costumes I like . It 's a win-win situation ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ screenshot btw was a screenie he took and submitted for a fashiaholic event . <p> November 2014 - Wizard LONG ... LONG ... And here is my current look . I came back to playing the game around November , coz I finally found some free time to spend . I finally put together a costume set that can make me look a little more like a night goddess ( Nyx ) . I put together my favorite back costume Queen Fairy Wings , the " asuna " costume I dyed black and deep purple , and a matching black head accessory . This is the look I was aiming for for so long , but when the game was just new , there were not much options . Now I finally achieved the look I want , I think I will be having this look for a long time to go ( unless I get my hands on the wedding gown costume which can be dyed all black too ) &gt;. &lt; <p> December 2014 - Bard LONG ... LONG ... And here is the current look of my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first one on this post . : ) <p> Overall , my looks went from light creatures to those of the night . A weird evolution pattern if you ask me , but I simply love all the costumes I had . All my in-game friends know how much I love costumes , spending thousands of gold just to get the ones I need , ending up not having enough gold to buy proper gear , but happy all the same . Afterall , we play the game how we want to play , and how we enjoy playing . <p> Goodluck to all the participants ! <p> Shichi <p> 01-03-2015 , 11:23 PM <p> Shichi 's Style Evolution <p> After the lag and disconnection events I had in AK OS for two months , I was brought here in AKPS . Thanks to my brother , ItlogWithEgg , who never fails to introduce me to new games . I started playing in this server around late March 2014 ( perfect time when school 's about to end. ) but my game activity was on and off ( I got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about private servers are the tons of costumes I can collect although my sense of fashion can never be sated I guess . Over the course of time , I have collected several costumes which I really like despite it means burning gold and LP. *u* <p> I 'm a School Girl ! LONG ... My very first character , Chromosome . I was so eager to play katar being the most recently released class at that time and I am a fan of dual wielders as well . I am forever grateful for my brother who helped me with gold earning . My character finally looks human ! Kotori school uniform was one of the earliest DAL costumes released I think ( as much as I can remember ) . I 'm not really fond of pink but the hair suits the AK uniform very well so just had to bear the pinkkkk . Of course , a school girl outfit would n't be perfect without the Mighty Moe backpack which I got from an event , and the Nummy Chocolate from a daily quest just to have some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... So I created a wizard as second character which eventually became my main instead . Though I am fond of melee classes , I am a fan of the mage class . I had this fashion style for quite a long time . My very first wings to have owned - Dark Night Evil Wings , especially it has a shade of blue ( which is my favorite color ) and it matches well with the Armor of Black Dragon which I bought from the LP store during a promotion . The Dread Wyrm Helmet looks badass as well so the total fashion combo looks amazing ( for my taste as least ) . <p> AMG ! Did someone say big white wings ? LONG ... I had been constantly checking the Endora 's Lair site for unreleased items and found about these BIG WHITE WINGS . I was so hyped that I 've been wishing for this item to be available in this server so soon . Well after several weeks they were finally attainable . The item was pricey and had bought it for 900g . Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fashionista would do almost anything just to complete his/her closet . My most awaited Ballerina tutu was attainable through paragon as well so it made me very happy ' cause it means at a cheaper price . The White Yagi ears are cute and the color matches well with the wings too . &lt;3 So flaunt those wings and sexy back ! <p> Let 's go " Victorian " LONG ... So my character has been showing too much skin . Why not go for longer skirts for a change ? I got this Evening Gown ( it still shows some skin though but at least it got some good rear cover XD ) through the paragon and to match it , I had to buy the Summer Fragrance Hat . My wizard now looks more of a lady although this style was only short-lived after the Maid outfit was on LP promotion . <p> MewMew in Merryland . LONG ... I have always wanted a Maid outfit but buying it for more than 1k gold is too pricey ( yes , I am being cheap ) . Luckily , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than happy even if it means spending LP instead of buying fort scrolls . The Serena Bunny Ears is so cute too and dyeing it " light yellow " complements the Turquoise dyed maid outfit . However , I have to hide the Celestial Wings since it 's quite big and overlaps with the hair.But wait , I did n't know that being an envoy of Gaia would also mean as " Alice in Wonderland " cosplayer ( or sort of ) . XD <p> Nobody 's Bride LONG ... One of my favorite costume types in online games - wedding dress . Though it 's just an introductory release in Bonus Mall , my hands could n't wait to own one so bought it for 2k gold . A gold burn , I know but its elegance is just so captivating . I have my wizard wearing this by the time I started playing again on my katar . <p> Back to Chromosome . ; 3 LONG ... After a month or two of being semi-active , I fully got back to the game last December 2014 but this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was quite bored with my wiz but seriously , I had much more fun with my katar . Anyway , I FINALLY GOT MY SUCCUBUS WINGS ! After months of waiting for it to reappear on paragon I finally bought one . I have n't grown tired with my maid outfit yet plus the Kitty Paws add more kawaii factor to it . But to match the wings , I had to dye the costume into Red Wine ( Bye bye Turquoise you 'll be missed ) . <p> I have other costumes but these are my favorites . Still , I could n't believe my character attended AK University but ended up as a maid kitty . D ; <p> llYumell <p> 01-04-2015 , 12:25 AM <p> My " Dream " Fashion <p> This is Where my " Dream " starts I created a character which I named llYumell ( It 's always been my IGN I choosed for every game I play although I put double small L in front this time ; ) Yume means Dream and this is How Yume 's look at the starting point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; so just simply take picture with them on lol <p> http : **38;13562;TOOLONG <p> The first time I am able to check Auction House , I directly check Costume section as I am madly in love with the costumes in Aura Kingdom xD And I bought some bad ass costumes which I can buy that time &lt;Robes of the Fallen Demon&gt; , I still remember it costs 10g and I still bought it . My friend angry at me and said It was over priced but I do n't care hahaha .... All I want is COSTUME ! ! ? <p> LONG ... <p> My best friend invited me to play in this server as this server is better than the other server . We play daily together and during that time I still do n't know about the Paragon and all . I only checked the costumes in AP , BP , and LP shop and starts making my list of wanted Costumes . That time my aim is only one to get all the costumes in LP shop without realizing Paragon actually can give more attractive costumes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ awesome looking costume that I really like during that time which he got from Paragon &lt;Gothic Lolita Jumperskirt&gt; . Also I bought &lt;Serena 's Bunny Ears&gt; for 600g from Auction House because I like that head accessory a lot and It is Dye-able . <p> LONG ... <p> Then one day I check on Paragon and tried it couple of times which give me &lt;Cherry Kimono Dress&gt; and other costumes . That 's when I started to get addicted into Paragon xD As you can see from the picture , I change Yume 's look to have black curly long hair : 3 <p> LONG ... <p> Another attractive Paragon appeared and I was getting almost all costumes in the paragon even the male costumes that I like xD &lt;Evening Gown&gt; is one of my favorite costume . This is the best screenshot I took out of all ? really love it . Also again I changed Yume 's Hair but this time only the color because I really love Blue color &gt;w&lt; <p> LONG ... <p> Of course I keep buying some costumes in Auction House to complete my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Halloween event .

I remember when I started playing the OS server , and I did n't  know anything about lp shop , paragon ... and I was so excited about those quests where you could choose a costume ! xD Some of them are really cute , tho ! Here 's probably my favourite quest costume ! Since I am a tachi , I choosed the long straight black hairstyle , to be more badass and samurai-looking. http : **29;14226;TOOLONG Ballerina Tutu was one of my 1st costumes won at the paragon ...

I worn the maid costume when doing house chores when I did n't  have any important quests and stuff . P.S. She 's kind of shy . ) http : **28;14348;TOOLONG Aaaand , back to work . This time in more snowy and cold places . http : **28;14378;TOOLONG Thank you for reading the fashion ( and love xD ) story of my character , Webkai ! I wanted to do this entry only about her , because every character is different and important to me !

In this contest , I decided to make three stories with different themes for you to enjoy : ) . With this said , I would like to present you : <p> Silenias Journey <p> Thietmars Story How It All Started Out <p> When I started out , I was amazed by stunning landscapes and wonderful , hospitable villagers . Freshly appointed adventurer , I made sure to help everyone in need , meanwhile admiring every single forests nook . Then , the strange glowing orb started following me everywhere , causing my annoyance . The sphere turned out to be an young Eidolon Daring Dragon . Loner by the nature , I was n't too happy for him to stick with me http : **25;14439;TOOLONG Screenshot1 . You can tell that out beginnings werent exactly the peacest ones Blame my hot-temper . <p> Willy-nilly , we started to understand each other more and cherish our company . I decided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liking to the name really fast : ) . During many predicaments , we learnt to trust and depend on each other . With the time we grew up together , we changed together , we became friends . http : **25;14466;TOOLONG Screenshot2 . There is always time for snack after the day filled with running quests . <p> Andromedes Tale Magical Girls To The Rescue ! <p> During my travels , I have met a little girl on the moon . Literally . Adorable Moonlight Maiden and I became bffs quite quickly . Both sensitive to injustice and common peoples problems present everywhere due to the war , we decided to form up a duo which could help out these who seek aid . Slowly , we gained fame amongst villagers who named us : Magical Girls . Pretty accurate name , is n't it ? http : **25;14493;TOOLONG Screenshot3 . Magical Girls to the rescue ! As you can see that look on Andromedes face , she is n't a fan of me striking poses <p> http : **25;14520;TOOLONG Screenshot4 . Its always good to have double up when first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they get dirty while fighting with various ruffians . <p> http : **25;14547;TOOLONG Screenshot5 . Sometimes running is not enough to get to crime scene in time that is when unicorns come in handy . <p> Al-Jaavedis Saga A Legend Is About To Rise <p> When efreet Al-Jaavedi broke out of his eternal prison , panic and terror spread between people like a fire . Ruthless ambition of Al-Jaavedi had driven him before to reach for power often by force . His instatiate desire was the reason he was imprisoned in first place . People scared of possibility of nightmares return , confined themselves in their homes . Fortunately , a stranger of demon descent appeared out of nowhere and challenged the bloodthirsty efreet to a duel . The course of a duel became a legend on its own . Unknown hero , being victorious , had taken Al-Jaavedi under her control . She decided to teach him how to get powerful without unnecessary hurting others . Al-Jaavedi slowly gained respect towards her and her methods and since then , these two helped out folks all over the world , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over their greatest enemies themselves . It is pretty sure that their adventures will bring many tales to tell http : **25;14574;TOOLONG Screenshot6 . A short break in between trainings there is nothing more refreshing than stroll by the waterfall . 
@@23370505 @3370505/ 21183 @qwx221183 <h> PvE Yuumu 's DPS Guardian Guide <p> I. Introduction <p> Yuumu here . In this guide , I 'll list and explain as much informations as I can to help aspiring Guardians that 's going to try to go the DPS way . As shown on the title , this guide is strictly for PvE only.II . Why a DPS Guardian ? <p> There 's a lot of reasons why one would pick DPS Guardians , whether if you 'd like to try one of the more rare classes , you just like knight-styled DPS classes , you 're a sword and shield maniac , you want that badass athena 's spear weapon costume so that you can pretend you 're a lancer class , or you just enjoy watching your character getting attacked by monsters , they 're all valid reasons , but above all , it 's fun ! <p> Testimony from another Guardian <p> Before you became a DPS guardian , there 's something that you tryhards might want to know , which is : While DPS guardian are pretty viable , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even if you minmax everything , so if you 're here hoping that you 'll become the best DPS in the server , I recommend rerolling into other classes.III . Pros and Cons <p> Pros : -Your base damage are actually pretty high , thanks to the various bonuses from path and envoy -Categorized as a Melee class , Therefore getting the melee bonuses such as 15% detailed damage -Higher survivability than most classes -Level 75 Weapons are inexpensive -IT'SFUN ! albeit in a masochistic way Cons : -Terrible CRIT rate -You can not hide your mistakes , as it 's very apparent if a guardian makes a mistakes such as failing to lure or dying -You 'll sometimes be refused from parties , just because you 're a guardian . Pretty sad , do n't you agree ? <p> IV . The Build <p> An example of a DPS Guardian build <p> A. Stats <p> Offensive DMG : This should be your priority , as this stat will give you the DPS needed to take aggro , or deal damage in general . CRIT : Should be your second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to put into crit if you wanted to , but do n't overdo it . SPD : Do n't put any points on this , as equipments will give you all the speed that you need to do a proper rotation . Getting about 3035% should be enough . <p> Defensive : HP : Put all of your points here , as you will overcap defense easily with equipments and your party buff , and eva is just ... useless . DEF : You can put some points here while you 're leveling , but when you have forted your equipments properly , no points are needed here . EVA : The only times you 're allowed to put points here are when you have some leftovers . <p> The reason why I did n't put most of my points into CRIT and invested into DMG instead is , in most parties , there 'll usually be a Crusader or other classes with CRIT buffs in your party . They will give you all the remaining CRIT that you need . If by some chance there 's none and you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eidos such as Bel-Chandra or Zaahir . You 'll also want as much Boss DMG / Ele DMG as you can get . Also , capped CDMG against bosses ( 300% CDMG total ) is a MUST . <p> B. Skills <p> Sword Slash - 140% DMG <p> Your basic skill . Has a neat but usually forgotten flat damage reduction for 6s . Can also be upgraded with masteries to either reduce enemy DEF or DMG by 12% <p> Shield Bash - 180% DMG <p> One of your highest damaging skill . Long animation time , Stuns . Can also be upgraded with mastery to give it a proper AoE effect that is somewhat useful in doing dungeon runs , since everyone will mob everything and kill them all at once . <p> A run-through skill . Works great as a gap closer and as a dodging utility . <p> Mirrored Shield <p> Damages everyone that attacks you by a fixed amount of damage . Useless in PvE . <p> Thunder Cut - 130% DMG <p> Your bread and butter skill . Use this often , as it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a multitude of things , such as elemental bonus , right path , and envoys . Also upgradable by masteries , but I wo n't recommend any of them . <p> Phalanx <p> Flat DMG reduction buff and 30% damage reduction . This is what gives you the survivability to survives attacks . Use this as often as you can , as it 's simply the best defensive skill in your arsenal . <p> Masteries are easily changeable , so do n't limit yourself to just one setup . But instead , switch masteries depends on the situation . Some of the useful ones that 's not listed above includes , but not limited to : <p> Booming Shield Bash - Gives Shield Bash a neat AoE <p> Pretty useful in runs where you 'll be mobbing a lot of monsters . <p> Courage - Max HP +7% , Damage taken -4% <p> Extra survivability when you find yourself dying too much . <p> Deep blue - +4% Detailed Damage , -11% Malice <p> I 'd probably be viewed as insane for recommending this for use of guardians , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high enough . Just do n't use it when you 're still gearing up . <p> E. Weapon Path <p> Both of guardian 's weapon path are good , but considering the right path gives way more DPS , I 'll be mostly discussing that here . <p> Right weapon path <p> Right Path Bonuses : <p> -God of Thunder : Gives you a gap closer skill with 190% DMG Coefficient . also gives you a +8% DMG buff . Unfortunately , it 's not detailed damage buff , but it 's still neat regardless . <p> -Thunder Concussion : Thunder Cut damage +15% , also gives thunder cut an additional wave in a + like fashion . The additional wave deals roughly 50% of Thunder Cut damage , and is counted as an additional attack . Which means , it can procs zeal as well . <p> As for the points , put maximum amounts into MSPD , CRIT , and feel free to use the rest as you please . I recommend CDMG if you did n't manage to cap , or DMG and HP if you do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Subclasses <p> Before picking your subclasses , keep in mind that subclasses are used to buff your main classes . If you 're thinking of something like using ravager sub so that you can use ravager skills to deal most of your damages , you 're better off picking that other class as your main class instead . <p> I do recommend bard sub , due to : -12% detailed damage from class mechanics -Ballad mastery to fill in the advanced mastery -Additional survivability thanks to the assortment of heals <p> Other choices that might work are Grenadier for its party buffs and multitude of buffs from the turret , Crusader that can also gives a lot of detailed damage and high burst skill , and Warbows , which can gives an extra zeal and movespeed bonus from forted weapons . <p> I will primarily only discuss the endgame weapons here , as for Level 60 and below weapon , you can use whatever green weapon at your level 5 starred . <p> Jade Forest Sword and Shield , Level 70 crafted SnS <p> Crafted weapons are always a good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help you to level to 75 . You may star it if you do n't think you 're going switch to the weapon below very easily , but keep in mind that it 's pretty expensive . Remember to craft it with a Lightning base weapon , as elements carry over from base weapon when crafting . <p> Seraphim Trial Sword and Shield , Level 75 Otherworld SnS <p> OW Candeo Core Drops . Probably the best weapon that you could get as a guardian right now . Switch to this if you can find a 135% and above Lightning elemental one . Keep in mind that you 'll lose 10% detailed boss damage when switching to this sword . Star fodders costs around 150250g at the time of writing this guide , which is pretty cheap for an OW Drop . <p> Lava Secret Stone Sword Slash - DMG+7% CRIT+2% Use Lava for the secret stone , and reroll it until one of the additional stats is DMG+2% . <p> As for the cards , you may use any zeal cards that you have , but the best would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Is n't so expensive anymore ! <p> Yes . Snipers . Not Monarch or ancient observer or whatever . If you 're thinking of using FULL ancient observer set , you 're at the wrong guide . You may mix sets when you have finalized your build , but starting up , it 's probably not a good idea . Use **29;14633;TOOLONG for the core , depending on your budget and what do you want . <p> You might want to use a DMG/DMG Enchantment cards on most , if not all of them . <p> Your go-to accessory set . Gives a lot of crit , 10% crit damage , and best of all , card slots . Use **29;14664;TOOLONG for the core , depending on your budget and what do you want . <p> Shirley Set <p> Shirley did nothing wrong . <p> Optional . These gives a lot of damage , also gives a chance to gives 6% additional damage taken debuff against your target , which is pretty neat . These are pretty expensive , and they 're less useful when there 's more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't stack . These also makes you lost a lot of CRIT , but still neat regardless in some situations . <p> You might want to use a DMG/DMG Enchantment cards on most , if not all of them . Feel free to have both sets , since they 're both useful in different circumstances . <p> D. Trophies <p> Crafted Spangler <p> These gives 11% detailed damage against bosses . This is a MUST HAVE equipment for everyone . Whatever you do , make sure you get this first , as it 's pretty cheap and the bonuses are so huge . Use **29;14695;TOOLONG for the core , depending on your budget and what do you want . <p> For the other trophy , feel free to choose anything that you want depending on your situation , some of the good choices include something such as green spangler for low budget or specific elemental trophies for specific monsters . <p> E. Heraldries <p> Heraldries / Gaia Emblems <p> For your heraldries , you might want to roll two , one with DMG + 6% just like in the picture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ catch up with higher movement speed characters . <p> F. Eidolons <p> For offensive purposes , your best bet are Eligos , Yarnaros or Cleopawtra . They gives +24% damage , which is huge . <p> Other useful choices are Bel-chandra or Zaahir , Which gives +15% CRIT , which you 'll most likely need . <p> For the upcoming one , Endora 3* might be perfect . <p> For defensive purposes , use Vermilion Vermilion gives -15% DMG taken , which is very handy , and since compared to tank guardians , we do n't really have a lot of base HP , so stacking damage taken will work better than stacking hp % . <p> G. Costumes <p> Basic Costume Loadout with Enchantments <p> I rolled DMG at all ( except head , since it does n't have one ) of my costumes . If you want to replace some with Damage Taken for survivability or CRIT , feel free . <p> In this part , I wo n't give a single fixed rotation that you 'll always use , Instead , I 'll give some advices and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with from that . <p> Basic Rotation Advices : <p> -Thunder Cut as the center of your rotation . <p> Thunder cut is undoubtably DPS Guardian 's strongest skill . While the base dmg coefficient is pretty low , the amount of upgrades it can possibly get is a lot . Use it in your rotation often , as not only it was your strongest skill , it also has a low cooldown , good AoE , and generates additional amount of malice . Notes : The bonuses are 20% from Weapon elemental , 16% from envoy , 15% from Right Weapon Path , and the additional waves it generates are another instances of attack dealing roughly 50% of thunder cut 's damage that procs its own zeal . <p> -Why not to spam sword slash <p> You use sword slash for defensive purposes such as applying the -DEF / -DMG debuff to the enemy and for the 6s reduce flat damage taken buff . By the way , sword slash also does n't generate extra malice unlike shield bash and thunder cut , so using this too much will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to time is still fine though . <p> -When to use Roar <p> Roar are a good tool to get aggro if you 're behind , or as an opener so that the monster 's aggro will be instantly on you , but spamming them wo n't do you any good , as they do n't give much continuous aggro and they do n't deal much damage . Against trash mobs though , you can use this as a DPS tool , considering the AoE is pretty huge . <p> VII . Tips and Tricks <p> -Jumpcast Everything ! <p> Jumpcasting is where you jump before you cast your skill , so that your character actually autoattacks and cast the skill at the same time . This increases your DPS a lot , and it also allows you movement while casting the skill . This helps a lot , since Terrifying Roar and Shield Bash has a very long animation time . <p> -Windfury as a dodging tool <p> Most people just uses windfury as a gap closer . It is n't wrong , but there 's another way to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With a skills like windfury , where you 'll run through the enemy if they 're too close , your hitbox instantly moves the moment the skill came out , You can use this to quickly get out of your way out of dangerous red carpets , and get back in position quickly with god of thunder . This trick is especially useful against red carpets where there are empty spots behind the enemy , such as Quelkulan 's or Hel 's dancing wave . <p> Aggro is pretty much the standard that everyone agrees that a guardian must get . And it 's pretty hard to keep track of it , considering there 's stuff like bosses skill targeting random player , mechanics induced aggro such as gunslinger 's charm skill or even a guardian 's roar , and such . Fortunately , there 's actually a pretty handy way to check whether if you 're able to take aggro consistently or not , which is : <p> Taking aggro from a monster that ca n't be debuffed . <p> That means , you can use any of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -Hel at ST Floor 18 -Nightmare Fenrir at ST Floor 22 -World Bosses <p> Of course , those units still have some skill targetting which targets random players , but when they 're done targeting their skill , the aggro will come back to the one holding the most ' continuous ' aggro . While some of can be influenced by differing factors such as different loading time in World Boss or the difference of quality between players on a public RG and organized RG in ST , they 're all generally still a good way to gauge your aggro . <p> VIII . End Notes <p> There 's still a lot of things that I have n't touched such as costume enchantments , I 'll save that for sometimes later . If there 's still a question , feel free to ask me or drop a question in the thread . I 'll try to help and update this guide if I can . If , after reading this guide you 're still feeling like playing a guardian , Have fun !

And awhile ago I also experienced lags when doing a solo dungeon runs and it is because of the server . Judging from the server time , our server is based somewhere in Europe I think ? Which is far from the Philippines resulting in a high ping . Try playing other games that have Asian and Europe based servers and you will see that you have a better ping when playing in an Asian one because it is nearer to our country . So upgrading the server might help reducing lags and high ping . <p> Spade <p> 03-20-2014 , 08:46 AM <p> I like your siggy Aya-san. its fukooooooooo ! <p> Ayasel <p> 03-20-2014 , 08:54 AM <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distance between you and the host will cause delays . that 's pretty much it <p> // .. off-topic <p> I like your siggy Aya-chwan. its fukooooooooo ! confusing when you call both of us as ' Aya-chwan ' . : D and yea lol. she 's high . best character of Clannad series besides Tomoyo <p> Fear <p> 03-20-2014 , 09:12 AM <p> I think it 's normal for us to get these lag spikes during peak hours but I still hope Aura/The staff could do something about this , try playing at night ( 7PM - 12AM PHT ) .

And the " lag spikes " you seems to experience have no relationship with the latest DC 's of today ( a problem we 're working on right now ) . Hopefully , once that is solved the stability will also become higher for most of our asian players . Regardless , the only thing we can not have any influence on is the ping between players and the server . <p> MeguMix <p> 03-21-2014 , 02:19 PM <p> // .. off-topic <p> confusing when you call both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yea lol. she 's high . best character of Clannad series besides Tomoyo

After this happens , there 's no possibility of recover . Because we get a lot of recovering requests aswell , we have set this period to be longer than 30 days , and that 's the reason why you can not re-use the name . Despite the fact I do not do name-swaps anymore , I do allow players to reuse names of characters they have deleted already . All you need to do is to send me a pm with the name of the character , and once I receive the pm , it will become available again after a server 's restart . I do advice to do this privately tho , you do n't want someone else to use the name instead ; ) <p> Akyrrim <p> 09-30-2015 , 11:55 AM <p> Thank you , Rainbowbejeweled and Aura .

I always thought that skill should have base noct on it tbh , it just fits . I wanted to play necro but I like death themed classes to have lifesteal or lots of self heal in general as part of the theme , so I quit it early on ( this was way back in OS , though I tried it again here for maybe 2 hours before quitting due to lack of interest in what should be part of its kit just as part of the theme imo ) <p> Nyuquist also gives 20% critdmg from preupdate as well , unless that got removed .

When a person asking for plvl , do you think they will accept the plvler that has the same lvl as the dungeons ? i doubt it . <p> Free Adv scrolls was never tradeable but it still can be used if you just move your item to that char and fortify from there then move it back to main char . <p> I appreciated that you actually explained the suggestion in details how you wanted to be unlike some people just say suggestions like they 're demanding for it .

This game is already too easy , so having chests instead of questline will make it gamebreaking .

@@23370514 @3370514/ <p> Mr Skeltal : He inflicts multiple debuffs , though they are not really too dangerous and he does n't have much damage other than the curse . Aelius might help here , but not by much . The main danger of this boss is the curse , where multiple skeletons outside will aim AoE 's at you . One option is to start at one side when the curse starts and slowly move to the opposite side while dodging ( streaming , if you 're familiar with the term ) to give you some space . However , this is not good for melees that are dependent on lifesteal . The other way is to run around him in a circle while finding space between the lines . This needs more movespeed and you need to be able to tank more hits , but melees can hit him while doing this . <p> Spider : He 'll just spawn 3 spider types , one just swarms you for damage which is quite easy to deal with using AoE skills , one debuffs some of your stats and one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the damage spiders can be easily dealt with and maybe even ignored , but the blow spider is really dangerous to tank . You should just kite the boss instead while avoiding the spiders , but for melee classes , you might have to dive in to deal some damage . The boss itself does n't deal much damage and is easy to dodge . <p> Or well , you could go full DPS on him without dodging anything , and hope that he just wo n't spawn blow spiders . <p> Gainey : Sorry , but I ca n't think of any way to deal with him without being gren main or sub . Seriously your sub sucks , just reroll it . <p> Upon reaching the area , summon a crystal somewhere that can be seen by the slaves but not within gainey 's aggro range . Then walk past gainey to start the battle , but do NOT hit him yet . Wait until he spawns his slaves . If his slaves start targeting the crystal , then you did it right . Now , while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freely DPS him for 40 seconds or so . <p> If you ca n't kill him within that duration , summon a turret before the crystal runs out to reset the slaves . Move away from it , do n't attack and wait till the slaves start attacking the turret again . Then you can freely attack gainey again . Repeat until he dies . <p> Rock Duke : A small circle AoE that he casts on a target . If you get hit , you will be lifted for 8 seconds and take 1135 DoT . You should always actively move around him because of this dangerous skill , and only move in to go full DPS right after he misses this skill . A straight line AoE that 's not really dangerous . A huge AoE skill with a safe spot near him , and rings outside for ranged players to stay on . This is the safest time to DPS him as long as you stay on a safe spot , but make sure to move immediately after the skill ends as he may cast the lifting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every 20 seconds if you do n't remove it . Red gives him 4% HP regeneration per second . Dark Blue gives him 95% damage reduction . Sky Blue gives him 75% ? damage reduction and some other effect . It 's still pointless to DPS him in this state . <p> So the most dangerous ones are Red and Yellow , so you should try to keep at least three circles each for these all the time . You can simply wait out the blue buffs , so to be safe , just try to replace them with Red and Yellow ones . Try to never ever ever get hit by the lift skill , especially when he has a yellow or red buff up , as this usually means he gets his HP back to full . Luck-based , and it 's highly dependent on your ability to burst him down after removing a buff . <p> Twins : The AoE 's seem to compliment each other , the AoE of one ogre fills up the spaces left by the other .

Just kill it . <p> True form : Summon Guardians : She summons two guardians , kill them while avoiding her attacks before you can damage her again . They 're not too tough . Portal : Summons a portal that spawns charm disciples . Not hard to kill either , and having multiple targets for lifesteal is really helpful . Three line AoE 's and a circle AoE to the front : I do n't really know which one of them inflicts which debuff , but they 're both not too hard to avoid . Always dodge them when you can . Glowing pits : these deal around 10-20k per tick ? Always avoid them . Pull her away to a different spot if the area gets cluttered . Pink hearts : these seem to hurt the most , around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drain your life quickly . Summoning turrets seemed to redirect some of these hearts , and allowed me to survive for longer . I 'm not sure , but maybe this can be done too with an aggro-heavy eidolon . Praise Gigas ! She also teleports around the room quite often , which is actually helpful sometimes when the area gets too cluttered with the glowing pits . <p> So strategy is pretty basic , kite her around , kill summons , and do n't try to tank anything . She has no deadly instant damage skills , but there 's just too much " small " hits that are going on at the same time , so you really need high defensive stats and recovery here . <p> Gearscores while doing both solos are only around 260k-310k . <p> Sera <p> 09-10-2014 , 02:58 PM <p> I 'm interested about how the mechanics actually work for these dungeons .

It really seems luck-based right now . Red seems to be 4% HP regen , dark blue is 95% damage reduction , yellow is some kind of full heal ( full heal if not turned off within 20 seconds ? ) and I do n't know what sky blue does . <p> No other way than hitting him with colors . If wrong colors spawn you need to walk through them , they 'll be replaced by a random one , MAYBE the one you need .

@@23370517 @3370517/ 21183 @qwx221183 <h> ' Nado Nuker Guide <p> Are you a fellow scrub Shuri ' scrubbing around the forums for a guide ? <p> Are you lost with what you could build on your Shuri ' to become broken as fudge ? <p> Are you also completely in love with Shurikens ? <p> Even if you did n't answer yes to all three , you 've probably come to the right place ! <p> 1 . Stats So , let 's start with the basics and go over where you should be putting your Stat Points . <p> DMG = 99 - This one is pretty self-explanatory as to why we put points into damage . CRIT = Place the rest of your points here . This is only if you ca n't reach crit without Weapon Spec , too . Do try to aim for 100% Crit , since this will give you consistent damage.SPD = If you 're able to hit 100% Crit without any hassle , then place the rest of your points into SPD , as this will give you the Zeal-Overcap effect , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or 0.5 ) . <p> As for the Defensive Stats <p> HP = 99 - Another easy one to explain . Prioritise HP over any other defensive stat , since Shuri 's are already squishy enough , and you do n't want to be more squishy ! DEF = Once you 've capped out your HP stats , place whatever points you have left into defense ! Try to overcap for the bonus HP% Bonus ! EVA = Pretend this stat does n't actually exist . Keep placing your points into DEF for the HP overcap , and forget that evasion is even a thing ! <p> 2 . Element Okay so that was the basics , now let 's move onto the more basic basics ! The weapon element that you should be going for in PvE is Storm ! Storm 's the best element on Shuri ' as Tornado is the bread and butter of your DPS , which is why the other skills do less damage than any classes skills compared on average , as they are mostly used for damage amplification and debuffing . The best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use other skills while your strongest skill is constantly active and dealing damage , allowing you to stack extra DPS ontop of your Tornado skill ! Win-Win Situation ! <p> 3 . Weapons , Armour &amp; Accessories Next , we 'll be looking at the types of Accessory and Armour sets that you should be using , as well as the Cores that you should be crafting your gear with ! Although it is looked down upon a lot , I would suggest doing a Hybrid build for a Shuri ' , and this is because Shuri 's already have 10% MSPD built into their envoy , so instead 3 cores can be traded in for bestial , as with higher level items , especially 90 's , the 1% will have a much stronger impact , whereas imperial never changes ( plus it 's nice to have lots of damage and health ) . <p> For the weapons it 's your standard Destroyer ( Main ) and Nocturnal ( Sub ) build as Shuri does not have a built-in nocturnal passive in their envoy . Aim to get 2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reroll them to have DMG 2% , but also aim to get DMG vs . Holy/Lightning elements , as this will greatly boost up your DPS for Sky Tower ! As for the Enchantment Cards you want to be getting a movement speed card with a Zeal effect , as Shuri ' basically relies on Zeal to bolster up their damage to a crazy amount . The perfect combination would be two 7% Movement speed cards , but anything with a zeal effect will do , although you should aim to get a HP% card if you ca n't get MSPD , since HP is the next best stat . <p> I may as well mention Emblems in this section . What you want to be looking for is a 8% or 11% Movement Speed Emblem , and if you can afford one , then go for a 15% Movement Speed Emblem . Although Movement Speed is n't directly related to DPS , it helps out a bunch when clearing dungeons , and more dungeons means more gold , and happy days ! Additionaly , you might also want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which directly increases the amount of damage your Tornado does ! Useful in dungeons if you 're too lazy to switch between elemental emblems , and is sometimes called Violent element as it 's the only emblem effective against monsters and bosses without an Element . <p> Outside of dungeons , especially in Sky Tower , you could also look into investing into " vs . Element " damage emblems . For starters , you can look to get a basic 12% vs. each element type , which are Holy , Dark , Flame , Ice , Storm and Lightning , and if you can afford them , then definitely upgrade to a 18% emblem . <p> 4 . Envoy 's Path <p> Top-Left Silver Block - The first block you will want to take is the 2% Detailed Damage buff , which stacks up to 5 times everytime your Shadow Warrior hits any kind of mob . This is highly useful for both bosses and general monsters , and is a must have for Shuri ' as it 's one of the easiest damage amplifiers to get . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amplifier . This one is a little harder to stack as you ca n't always be sure the flame damage will hit the mobs , especially during boss fights that have more than one mob for the shadow warrior to focus on . However , on one-to-one boss fights , this greatly helps to amp up the damage of your tornado . <p> Right-Bottom Silver Block - NOW , here 's where things get really good . This is one the strongest damage amplifiers that the Shuri ' has in their envoy , especially after it good buffed in a previous patch . Critical strikes have a 20% chance to trigger the buff , which increases all damage by 90% for 1.5 seconds , and can be re-activited after a 7 second cooldown , so in theory it 's only on cooldown for 5.5 Seconds , which is amazing if you have 100% crit as your fifth critical strike should trigger the buff , if it does n't trigger the buff beforehand . <p> The top blocks that I took to get the movement speed ensure you take the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gone straight up from the middle-starting block to get the 10% movement speed blocks . However , starting from the damage blocks allows the Shuri ' to get 3% HP and DEF , and although the DEF blocks may seem useless , they help with the DEF overcap , therefore adding extra value to the HP% overcap . As for the bottom part of the envoy path , I went with the Crit-Damage blocks as I am able to hit 100% crit both outside and inside of combat without any buffs or foods , therefore I personally found the flat Crit blocks to be useless . The main aim of the bottom path is to get the 90% damage increase silver block . Although I could have also gone down the Cooldown and Speed route to get the 90% Block and the Storm Damage blocks , there is no point in overcapping the 50% Cooldown Cap , nor is there any point in overcapping the 77% Attack Speed that Shuri ' requires to Auto Attack twice every second <p> 5 . Left-Path &amp; Right-Path ( Greatsword Sub ) Left-Path Shuri @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a ' Trash ' path , as each one is equally good depending on where you use it . <p> So to begin with , the left path is solely designed to murder bosses . The damage output that left path can provide is able to rival that of a Lancer ( definitely not as OP as a lancer but it feels like it ) ; and this is all because of the 3 Chakra restore from your Left-Path skill . The 3-chakra restore allows the Shuri ' to use up to 3 Tornadoes within a very short time span , which makes their damage go through the roof if executed correctly . <p> As we do n't have a way to instantly activate the shadow warrior , make sure you have Red Chakra before starting the combo shown above , otherwise your damage will be very low . To activate the Red Chakra , use the rotation below : <p> The rotation above ensures you 're starting to apply the defense reduction stacks from Swift Toss , and it 's important that you use Swift Toss after every single @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ short duration and is very powerful , granting you a debuff that shreds away up to 5000 -DEF Points from the boss . As a result , pairing Shuri ' with Greatsword Sub is highly recommended as Greatsword Sub fills the missing roles of the Shuri , which are : Gap-Closing , Very High Range AoE-Attack , Instant DEF Debuff , and Detailed DMG buffs , which come together to amplify the Shuri 's tornado even more . However , the main of appeal of Greatsword Sub is the Dragon Slash skill , which when charged , reduces the targets armor by up to 4600 -DEF Points , reaching up to 10,000 -DEF Points reduction at higher levels which provides a huge increase to the Shuri ' Tornado burst . In order to make the Dragon Slash skill more powerful , buy a secret stone from the Greatsword Class master , which sells a secret stone that increases Dragon Slash duration by 4 seconds , allowing your DPS to be that much greater for an extra 4 seconds . <p> The only downside to the Left-Path class is that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what you will be doing most of the time . Therefore , you 'll mostly find yourself using the Right-Path , which is a super high-burst path that is best used in dungeons and against bosses that you are sure you can One-Shot.

Pretty sure that 'll make up for the +1 to all your skills as well . <p> With the addition of +20% damage to Thunder Cut , that makes the 85 SnS even better . It 's a core skill in your DPS rotation that will already be enhanced by the lightening element of your weapon . 20% more makes it even stronger . <p> You already said everything dies too fast anyway , so losing a core wo n't be too much of a loss , especially if it means your damage will be higher = killing things even faster . <p> Do note though that although the 75 weapons had more damage than the 70 weapons , it was n't anything too major . I 'm not sure how it 'll be with the higher base damage of 80 and 85 weapons and with the higher primary weapon damage , but sticking with 80 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TC is so tempting though and will probably make your DPS higher . <p> From my experiences , 120%/125% scrolls are worth using if you want your weapon to be guaranteed the right element , the core you want , and a higher percent . Of course you could try to get lucky without them . 80 weapons will be easier to 5 star seeing as how you can farm mats/buy mats and you can craft anytime you want . <p> I did n't look up whether or not the info on the 85 SnS is right , so this is assuming that the given bonuses on the 85 SnS is correct . <p> You will lose +10% detailed damage if using lvl 85 weapon and I 'm sure their drop are low , craft lvl 80 SnS and make it 5stars +20 ( with lightning element ) . <p> 8% primary weapon damage is a form of detailed damage . Not only does it affect your damage on bosses , it increases your damage against regular mobs/elites as well . It was the same with the 3%/6% from 75 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weapon damage will make your damage higher than the 80 weapons with 10% boss damage . I do agree with level 80 weapons being enough though . <p> edoardus91 <p> 09-30-2015 , 03:42 AM <p> 8% primary weapon damage is a form of detailed damage .

Now I can start ; <p> 1- For all this time , hundreds of players been botting and injecting the gold earned through botting into the economy we have today . This economy already sucks . Everything is either over priced or nothing that has value over 1kg actually sells . Taking bots out of this game which has fraction of a population of any other MMO is a huge blow to the people who enjoy the game with what they have got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ banning actually bring to the table ?

I really have to wonder , have you played the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ economy is already broken , I 'd guess not . On Aeria 's version , the lion mount for instance - gold one , is 35,000 gold while on here its 300g . I do n't see a broken economy in the fix provided . The mere fact you are calling Aura greedy - at least that 's what I take from that , is quite senseless , being that what she does is to help the game progress and stay around . Why does it seem to rile you up so that she 's taken the step to remove the fish-botters ? Perhaps you are one of those said botters . Not to mention , it amuses me that you see this as a ' p2w ' game , if it was p2w , we would n't have the eidolons we have , I 've collected all but 2 . Nor would we have the hundreds of lovely fashions obtainable via paragon . Just as well , do you think thousands of players would have 20+ gear if this was p2w ? No . As far as new content @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When I checked 2 months ago , they had no new content , here we have new maps , just implemented not that long ago , we 're gaining new floors for ST and soon enough we 'll have more additional new content released if not this month or next month , then in April . I 'd rather spend my time waiting 2-3 months for new content than waiting a year as is the case with Aeria . This server is run as best as possible , Aura does an exceptional job in her work and so do the other admins like Miori , Aya and whoever else . Attacking them for their job and their effort in trying to keep the economy fair as well as remove those players who are greedy or selfish to reap the rewards of the game through unfair and indecent means will do you no good , especially if you are one of those players . <p> So minus what the above has said , keep up the good work you guys , do n't let people like this get you down or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've always got a Teddy on your side And forgive this bear for sounding mean or rude in anyway as was not my intentions -bows respectfully- I just dislike people saying things that they clearly know nothing about and ca n't help the need in my stomach to defend those I find to be justly right . <p> Chiriko <p> 02-09-2015 , 11:22 PM <p> Thank you Aura , my hardworks pay off xD <p> Less cheater more fun : D <p> Chinami <p> 02-09-2015 , 11:24 PM <p> Here comes a reply to what I think is really going on ; <p> Honestly , Aura , I have to be straight up with you .

For all this time , hundreds of players been botting and injecting the gold earned through botting into the economy we have today . This economy already sucks . Everything is either over priced or nothing that has value over 1kg actually sells . Taking bots out of this game which has fraction of a population of any other MMO is a huge blow to the people who enjoy the game with what they have got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ support your claim that " hundreds of players have been botting " and " fraction of a population of any other MMO " . Do you have screenshots of a ton of legit botters ? Do you have the figures to how many players are online ? <p> b ) Maybe nothing that YOU put for 1kg+ . Are you deliberately trying to overprice items ? Apart from very rare clothing and really OP lv75 weapons nothing really goes above the region of 1k . What 's your definition of " value " ? Are you actually checking item prices from the AH or are you just assuming their prices ? What costs 1k to you ? ( and please do n't say one stack of Fire Meteorite Ores ) . Compare with aeria server and you 'll see what " overpriced " actually means . <p> c ) So your argument is that taking out bots would screw the economy over and screw over the game 's population ? Then what was the 4th channel for ? Again , play on aeria and see if you can say that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enjoys watching a ton of bots ? <p> 3 . What kind of consequence does banning actually bring to the table ? Ask yourself before wasting your time taking these people out of the game . People who stopped botting have already decked out their multiple characters .... congratz you banned the new-comer bots into the game while %80 of the people have stopped and reaping their rewards already . #wasteoftime <p> Just because someone has all of their characters " decked out " through botting , does n't mean that they 'll necessarily stop . If they 've been getting away with it for that long , they also have a chance to keep botting . And whoever does that and got found out would be banned . I do see your point with this part of your post but I do n't agree it 's a waste of time . <p> 4 . We all know what truly is going on here . The fact that Aura wastes her time banning some stupid afk botters instead of bringing in content , events , and enriching the game itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this game is being managed by someone who knows that they are doing because the ONLY reason she/he is wasting her time instead of helping the game develop is because of GREED . <p> By taking out bots who actually help the economy develop ( 50 million gold ? okay ... stop b.sing ) , she wants people to spend more time playing the game to earn money ... or .... wait ... what she really wants by taking out the bots is that AP/BP economy will go up . Because this game is driven by real money and is a pay-to-win game for casuals , she does understand that by filtering out the money gain from bots she can easily manipulate the economy and give more incentives on paying real money to get what you want . <p> This looks fun . OK , firstly , how do you even link greed to shifting focus to fish bots instead of new content ? OK everyone wants new content , but they also do n't want fish botters inflating the economy with said " 50 million gold " . Reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or any significant amount ( fyi 50m gold is n't even possible for a whole account given the 8-char 99k-gold cap ) , they can encourage people to sell at high prices because they can afford higher prices . Result ? Economy gets overinflated and messed up like aeria . Next thing there 'll be people sending you daily mails advertising for gold selling sites and ... oh wait , play aeria and you 'll know . And because people wo n't be able to afford recipes and gears and stuff , they 'll actually go to those sites and get scammed or other whatnot . Again , play aeria for reference . So how do bots actually help the economy " develop " ? " Inflating " and " developing " the economy , while it could be hard to believe , is n't the same thing . <p> Now for the second half of that needless text wall . I 'll just put point 5 . <p> 5 . By taking out bots who actually help the economy develop ( 50 million gold ? okay ... stop b.sing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the game to earn money ... or .... wait ... what she really wants by taking out the bots is that AP/BP economy will go up . Because this game is driven by real money and is a pay-to-win game for casuals , she does understand that by filtering out the money gain from bots she can easily manipulate the economy and give more incentives on paying real money to get what you want . <p> Please tell me how the game is driven by real money when 90% of the stuff you can buy with AP are purely cosmetic . Do you see recipes or really OP gear being sold in some magical secret Harry Potter-style hidden section of the AP store which you have to tap the categories in a specific order to make it appear ? Before you say those blue Aura weapons , those only scale up to level 40 which is about 2 hours of content . Try again . <p> I 'm going to define " value " here . What gives an item value ? I would say it 's mostly because of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something is , the more value is assigned to it . Therefore how does taking bots out of the game make people spend more ? The economy 's pretty much balanced as it is and you can get the best gear without even paying anything at all . What will happen if the bots are n't taken out is that the gold to AP/BP ratio will skyrocket because you can get gold so much more easily and therefore the value of gold is automatically reduced because of all the gold that these bots are bringing in . What used to be 1G:1AP ( 2G:1BP ) could rise to 10G:1AP ( 20G:1BP ) . Next thing there 'll be people sending you daily mails advertising for gold selling sites and ... oh wait , play aeria and you 'll know . And you do n't even know if those sites are legit or not , and you 'll be scammed out of your money . Have fun . <p> If I had to estimate an exchange rate for the 1G on this server to 1G on aeria server , it 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's how messed up aeria server 's gotten because of botters and scammers encouraging people to buy at prices which just keep rising and rising . <p> 6 . None of the bullshit that is being explained justifies this games economy . There is a reason why the original server sucks and turned into a complete pay-to-win ... i expect nothing else out of this game either . So keep wasting your time finding out bots instead of fixing up the game and for once improving it ... look how fking behind we are from the original server ... #greed <p> Yes . There is a reason the original server " sucks " and it 's because aeria pretty much made what you posted here happen by ignoring gold botters . If you do n't consider finding bots as fixing up the game and do n't even expect anything out of this anyway , then go back to one of the other games you were playing . Better yet , why not play aeria and go compete with those Gren/Bard Lifebringer bots ? Maybe you 'll see how messed up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

Suck it up or go back to the hell hole known as Aeria . <p> Maybe aeria is sending their lapdogs here to ruin us . IT 'S A CONSPIRACY ! ! ! ! ! <p> 3- We all know what truly is going on here . The fact that Aura wastes her time banning some stupid afk botters instead of bringing in content , events , and enriching the game itself she is busy taking out the bots ? ...... Clearly this game is being managed by someone who knows that they are doing because the ONLY reason she/he is wasting her time instead of helping the game develop is because of GREED . By taking out bots who actually help the economy develop ( 50 million gold ? okay ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time playing the game to earn money ... or .... wait ... what she really wants by taking out the bots is that AP/BP economy will go up . Because this game is driven by real money and is a pay-to-win game for casuals , she does understand that by filtering out the money gain from bots she can easily manipulate the economy and give more incentives on paying real money to get what you want . <p> Oh my , someone needs to relearn basic economics . <p> I 'll put it in the simplest terms as I can , Increase amount of money in circulation&gt;value of money decreases&gt;prices go up because money is now so common , people are more willing to spend&gt;New players , who have almost zero to a few gold will now start to find both legitimate and illegitimate means because necessary goods ( recipes , yellow drops ) are now so expensive&gt;Rate of gold coming in to the game would overpower the rate of gold leaving the game ( crafting , buying stuff from npc , etc ) &gt; Increase amount of money in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> If you 'd like , you can refer to the economy in RO , a classic example of how inflation happens . <p> EDIT : Sorry , was too worked up , and forgot to thank Aura , Ayasel , Delaney , and the other people who went bot busting ( sorrry I 'm erally bad at remembering stuff ) <p> Ephraim <p> 02-10-2015 , 01:50 AM <p> Here comes a reply to what I think is really going on ; <p> Honestly , Aura , I have to be straight up with you . I am not one of the carebear individuals who constantly suck up to you or think that your actions are justifiable . I am an individual with solid experience in the MMO genre , seeing I played WoW for 7 years and I am taking a break to play this game . ( played LOTR online - ultima online - Rift and much more ) . I joined this server as one of my friends told me that it is easier and care-free compared to the original . But at the very least this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ currently exists already . Before I go on with my rant about how banning people for fish botting which is itself is an absurdly imbecile action , I wanted to present myself . Now I can start ; <p> 1- For all this time , hundreds of players been botting and injecting the gold earned through botting into the economy we have today . This economy already sucks . Everything is either over priced or nothing that has value over 1kg actually sells . Taking bots out of this game which has fraction of a population of any other MMO is a huge blow to the people who enjoy the game with what they have got going on . <p> 2- What kind of consequence does banning actually bring to the table ? Ask yourself before wasting your time taking these people out of the game . People who stopped botting have already decked out their multiple characters .... congratz you banned the new-comer bots into the game while %80 of the people have stopped and reaping their rewards already . #wasteoftime <p> 3- We all know what truly is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time banning some stupid afk botters instead of bringing in content , events , and enriching the game itself she is busy taking out the bots ? ...... Clearly this game is being managed by someone who knows that they are doing because the ONLY reason she/he is wasting her time instead of helping the game develop is because of GREED . By taking out bots who actually help the economy develop ( 50 million gold ? okay ... stop b.sing ) , she wants people to spend more time playing the game to earn money ... or .... wait ... what she really wants by taking out the bots is that AP/BP economy will go up . Because this game is driven by real money and is a pay-to-win game for casuals , she does understand that by filtering out the money gain from bots she can easily manipulate the economy and give more incentives on paying real money to get what you want . <p> None of the bullshit that is being explained justifies this games economy . There is a reason why the original server sucks and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of this game either . So keep wasting your time finding out bots instead of fixing up the game and for once improving it ... look how fking behind we are from the original server ... #greed <p> What i read : <p> LONG ... <p> What i think i read : <p> LONG ... <p> What i think about it : <p> LONG ...

" . Granted I have n't been involved , but from what I 've observed bot apologists act like a bunch of children that were caught with their hands in the cookie jar . However , rather than take the fall with dignity and peace , they decide to unload a wave of vitriol . <p> Major respects to Aura and the PS crew for being much more competent and serious than Aeria ever will be with AK . <p> Deathskullz <p> 02-10-2015 , 09:03 AM <p> Urgh ..... reading this is making my braincell deteriorate .

These usually involve ; * @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pm(purple) . If you 're really manually fishing , typing a few letters wo n't be a problem would it ? I 've seen players do this to me when I fish to get baits for king fish . A simple " hi " , " hello " wont even take 10 sec from your activity . I even respond rudely at times ( my apologies to them ) with the occasional GTFO response . * fishing on areas where a character practically hides . These are probably those who knew the difference fishing animations , so to conceal their " activity " , they will look for a spot that is either difficult to access or hides their character completely , making it even more suspicious . <p> - of course admins/mods have more tools at their disposal to check ingame or check reports ( via screenshot or video ) <p> - although I personally do n't approve it , but you can afk fish 24/7 , until you get disconnected , or until your PC explodes . No penalty ingame . Well experienced players wo n't bother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fishing . AFK fishing is an ingame feature built inside the game . Botting is NOT . <p> - I really do n't get it why people would actually manual fish for more than 3 hours . You can get baits for FK from orange fish for much less than that . And if it 's gold , running low level dungeons would be more efficient ( in my opinion of course ) . <p> - But hey , if manual fishing for a long duration is your thing to enjoy the game , as long as you do it within the rules , and take into consideration of bot sweeps from players and mods ( meaning asking for responses to their greeting/question ) , then by all means go for it . <p> - the excuse " i 'm not obligated to answer your chat/pm " , " I did n't see you because hide player is on " and similar to those remarks were tried before ( during the earlier days of the server I think ) . All I can say is ..... nice try ; ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like gon na be a circle , since people that got banned just gon na go and create a new account and have their guild help them lvl and who knows they will do it again , or not LONG ... <p> DoLL <p> 02-10-2015 , 10:55 PM <p> I just wasted 5 minutes of my time reading crazy comments . Go complain more people , one day Aura gets flare up and shut the server and all of you can shut your mouth . Learn to appreciate . <p> Great Job there for finally clearing out the botters , kinda late but its better than never . <p> You guys said when you do n't reply while fishing you get banned ? well when i leave my char with 1000 worms it takes like 3-4hours while I play other games so when i do n't reply to a pm gets me banned ? <p> Answer : <p> - if you really do n't know , it 's the fishing animation and the penguin spawn ( correct me if my info is outdated ) <p> - unfortunately suspected botters and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ players will look for other signs .

No penalty ingame . Well experienced players wo n't bother asking for a response since they know you 're afk fishing . AFK fishing is an ingame feature built inside the game . Botting is NOT . <p> MANUALLY FISHING : - You can catch white , green , and orange fish , as well as miracle cubes . - People CAN HEAR you reeling as well as successfully or unsuccessfully catch a fish . - People CAN SEE you catch fish due to the fishing animation that ONLY APPEAR IF YOU MANUALLY CAUGHT A FISH . I repeat , the fishing animation ONLY APPEARS IF YOU CAUGHT A FISH MANUALLY , It does n't appaer when you AFK fish only when you MANUALLY FISH . <p> Now if I saw the animation of someone fishing that means the following : either you 're not afk and fishing yourself for orange fish OR you 're botting because the animation only appears if you 're MANUALLY FISHING . YOU ARE ACTUALLY THERE FISHING ( unless you 're botting ) . <p> What is fish animation ? PICTURE ( http @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Answer : <p> Holy fuck people are dense nowadays and ca n't tell the difference between afk fishing and bot fishing <p> i got a few questions and inquiries that i would like to ask , feel free to flame because it seems most of you do it anyway . <p> 1 . the screenshots that ive seen in one of threads , how much time was spent asking the " hi , are you there " and " nah ? ok " messages ? was it like 3 second difference then doing screenshots then chaging channels already ? ( some of you might think that " they shoudlve messaged that person within seconds or 5 minutes at most " , can they prove that they the alleged fish botter DID NT respond ? ) <p> 2. as i 've read the thread , people seemed to be botting even before the PURGING began . I have n't checked all of them yet but i havent seen the people who got SS-ed afk fish botting allegedly being banned . I can still seem them being in-game because of an assumption @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WERE ( note the tense ) . Isnt it unfair that they walk scathe free because they stopped before the banning began ? i would like to ask your opinion if it is fair or not to ban the people who got SS-ed afk fish botting ( allegedly ) . To make it short , should Aura ban people who got SS-ed allegedly fish botting before the Purging or not <p> 3. is it allowed to catch orange fishes for a long period of time if you are monitoring your character ( e.g. watching a movie while monitoring your character fishing orange and replying when someone asks ) <p> 4. i noticed that no posts were made by the bot fishers who were trying to explain why they were doing it . ( assume being bashed , hated and burned at the stake alive ) . i personally am curious and interested why they did it however ridiculous the reasons are . <p> 5. a friend of mine was reported afk fishing becuase when my friend was catching orange fishes for creating a fishing set , a " vigilante " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friend if he was online but in that time he was in the middle of reeling in the orange fish which took 10-15 seconds to do . by the time he was about to reply the vigilante presumably changed channel or went off-line that my friend did n't  get a chance to reply . by the time my friend get a hold of the vigilante , that person already said that he already showed the SS to others .

I do n't fish like ... ever ... ? But my daughter loves to do it every once in a while . There are actual legitimate checks that go into identifying bots rather than just expecting people to respond to PM 's , right ? <p> Do n't get me wrong , I 'm totally grooming her to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> 5gPerHeal <p> 02-11-2015 , 03:01 AM <p> 5. a friend of mine was reported afk fishing becuase when my friend was catching orange fishes for creating a fishing set , a " vigilante " ( i use the term loosely ) was pm-ing my friend if he was online but in that time he was in the middle of reeling in the orange fish which took 10-15 seconds to do . by the time he was about to reply the vigilante presumably changed channel or went off-line that my friend did n't  get a chance to reply . by the time my friend get a hold of the vigilante , that person already said that he already showed the SS to others .

I 'm not sure about this but i wonder why do ppl have to answer to strangers too 2 . It seems like aura has no proof for those cases 3 . Botting is literally forbidden , but they can only catch AFK ones , so i assume you would be fine as long as you are not away from keyboard 4 . Apparently for gold 5. same as 1 <p> Luna <p> 02-11-2015 , 03:06 AM <p> 1 . the screenshots that ive seen in one of threads , how much time was spent asking the " hi , are you there " and " nah ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then doing screenshots then chaging channels already ? ( some of you might think that " they shoudlve messaged that person within seconds or 5 minutes at most " , can they prove that they the alleged fish botter DID NT respond ? ) <p> I can assure you that no way in hell would Aura ban with just one screenshot proof in-hand . People who reported the botters had a good proof and have waited AT LEAST 5 mins ( 10 mins max ) before they called the fisher a botter . Do you really need that long to reply ? The screenshots you 've seen from threads are not enough , these people were merely showing examples , they were n't meant to be a valid proof to report botters to Aura . And even so , if Aura considered these screenshots as proof , I 'm pretty sure she got on these accounts and saw the amount of unreasonable gold they have which indicated they have been botting . <p> Aura said it herself here : <p> Manual botting is pretty obvious . Its no the fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cases report they have been waiting over 30 minutes for an answer . But its not only that , their trades and mail , the fact they do n't attack the penguins or get killed by aggro-monsters , and if that is n't enough , the amount of gold they own . Most of the character that were banned today had more than 1kk in their power . Some , even had between 4 and 6 . In total , we have banned about 50 millions of gold from the server just with today 's bans . So as I said this is not a witch hunt , this is people who was trully messing up the game . If you are n't doing anything wrong , there 's nothing to be so worried about . <p> If you wish to report botters you have to submit your proof in Player Discussion &gt; Behavior section where only admins can see .

( some of you might think that " they shoudlve messaged that person within seconds or 5 minutes at most " , can they prove that they the alleged fish botter DID NT respond ? ) <p> 2. as i 've read the thread , people seemed to be botting even before the PURGING began . I have n't checked all of them yet but i havent seen the people who got SS-ed afk fish botting allegedly being banned . I can still seem them being in-game because of an assumption that they stopped botting when it was clear they the WERE ( note the tense ) . Isnt it unfair that they walk scathe free because they stopped before the banning began ? i would like to ask your opinion if it is fair or not to ban the people who got SS-ed afk fish botting ( allegedly ) . To make it short , should Aura ban people who got SS-ed allegedly fish botting before the Purging or not <p> 3. is it allowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you are monitoring your character ( e.g. watching a movie while monitoring your character fishing orange and replying when someone asks ) <p> 4. i noticed that no posts were made by the bot fishers who were trying to explain why they were doing it . ( assume being bashed , hated and burned at the stake alive ) . i personally am curious and interested why they did it however ridiculous the reasons are . <p> 5. a friend of mine was reported afk fishing becuase when my friend was catching orange fishes for creating a fishing set , a " vigilante " ( i use the term loosely ) was pm-ing my friend if he was online but in that time he was in the middle of reeling in the orange fish which took 10-15 seconds to do . by the time he was about to reply the vigilante presumably changed channel or went off-line that my friend did n't  get a chance to reply . by the time my friend get a hold of the vigilante , that person already said that he already showed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to you let 's just say : Schrodinger 's cat ) <p> p.s. i bet people who read this post will assume i bot trying to get an explanation of the event . you are free to your opinion as ive said flamers are welcome <p> 1 . I think that most of the accurate SS that were used to ban these individuals were in the behavior section and they are private , only the reporter and the admin/mod can see the reports . And I believe you do n't get banned by just a couple of SS , admin/mods do cross checks as well . Improper reports are replied and dismissed as well . <p> 2 . It may well be true that they have , and now walking free since they know that bot sweeping is currently happening . Yes I do believe that should be banned as well , if proper evidence is submitted and cross checked . If you have them SS , would you properly submit a report in the correct section ? <p> 3 . If your eyes can cope and endure the stress of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to another ( active game ) , without experiencing any i 'll side effects , and take notice the players around you ( bot sweepers player/mods ) , and still understand the film you 're watching , while pressing/releasing the mouse button and making sure the fish does not leave the blue area on the fishing bar when you manually fish ( not botting ) for a LONG time ...... then I think it 's ok. ( honestly , this situation is rubbish , but that 's just me ) <p> 4 . They probably did already , they just try to either ; 1 . not admit it , or 2. say it 's a friend , girlfriend , boyfriend , sister , brother , mother , father , cousin , ancestor who got caught and then make a somewhat long and deliberately confusing thread/post to justify it . <p> 5 . Being reported and being banned are two separate situations . If your " friend " was actively fishing orange fishes as you said and was reported , he does n't need to worry much does he ? Unfortunately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reasons " . Some do it because they care for the game/server , and some just do it to be a jerk , douche , A@#@hoL3 , etc . Just always remember , " if you 're doing nothing against the games rules , you have nothing to worry about " . In some situations they do allow you to appeal your case , if I 'm right . <p> P.S. the issue at hand and the join date of your forum account is a magnet for assumptions:rolleyes : <p> Azumarion <p> 02-11-2015 , 05:36 AM <p> It 's sad to see that some of those banned were people I knew in-game . But hey , no complaints here . Thanks Aura ! <p> 5gPerHeal <p> 02-11-2015 , 06:00 AM <p> will get banned if get caught ? what if they stopped fish botting before the purge happned , i think its unfair for the new fish botters to get banned when the other players who were CLEARLY fish botting did n't  get banned also . Abusing such system should have not have statute of limitation <p> guess what life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> if you get banned it 's because your stupidity and greed , if someone using bot and never get caught , then there 's nothing can be done . you can either suck it up or just leave . but if they still doing it even now then sooner or later they will get caught . <p> I get a headache every time some troll with terrible grammar calls another person an idiot . I also get a headache every time I see some mmorpg noob bragging about his 7 years on a trash blizzard game . I also get a headache when people are confused about the difference between botting and afk fishing . I also get a headache when I spend too much time reading the most pointless post ever ; aura should have locked this after it was posted . <p> Aura you 're giving me a headache , good job taking out some novice botters though .. The kidsforsale guy does n't even know how to code , he was on some forum begging for people to make him a bot before all of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kingdom.to forums to try to " prove his innocence , " with the SAME NAME he registered to the bot forums with . <p> I would like to state .. the pros who are botting never get caught , this is a fact . However , pros do not bot on mmorpgs ... It is n't profitable , it is n't even a worth while time investment , and most of all it is n't a challenge for the pros . ( it 's very rare a professional goes below their own standards they created . ) <p> So with that said , all of you kids who ca n't speak english worth a crap and think you 're immortal on this video game behind your cheap bots that you do n't have the intelligence to even begin to code , tweak , or understand ; you will be banned meaninglessly when you could have just played a few hours a day for a month and would have had an end game character you could keep by actually playing . Just because you got away with it on aeria does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's safe , or that it is profitable . <p> I know , with such terrible english skills and such puny brains it can be hard to see the difference but .... <p> **26;15706;TOOLONG Aeria =/= Aura **32;15734;TOOLONG provides bots ............ does . Removes botters sells generated gold ... not .. disapproves of RMT ruined their own game equalGives 110% to the game at all times <p> You know it actually makes sense to bot when sniper recipes are 30k each like with aeria ; but here where they 're 500 gold ? Not so much I would say .. you can literally spend one single hour running dungeons or even spend 10 lucky seconds on the paragon and make that gold here , as opposed to spending several months farming 6-8 hours a day for a complete set on aeria . So what is really being accomplished by botting on this server ? In my own personal opinion : You can gain a lot by botting on this server ; you gain an understanding over your mental weakness , you learn how lack of intelligence is equal to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you gain the choice to wake up and move on . 
@@23370526 @3370526/ <p> Patch Notes : - New : " Valley of War " Capture the Flag new PvP Mode . Apparently , the Leonin Tribe has one favorite annual celebration , and of course it includes fighting . To honor and participate in this interesting tradition , players will be able to teleport to a Ventos Prairie inspired battle map during the weekends . In the new pvp mode , up to 50 players in each team can face each other on an strategy competition ( althought , of course , the match can start with 15 members on each team ) . In a total of 20 minutes , each team will have to capture each other 's flag in order to siege and conquer each other 's camps . <p> The new PvP mode will have 3 editions , on saturdays and sundays . You will be able to enter at 6am , 12pm and 6pm ( between sky tower runs ) and it will have a total duration of 30 minutes . In reward for completing the match , players will receive valor coins as prizes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Archeology Dungeon ) . The Court of Philae was thought to be only a myth between collectors , adventurers and archeologists . But latest expeditions into the depth of Star Sand Desert found real evidence of the Ruins of what once was a majectic city hidden underground . Sadly , the ruins are not only filled with treasures but dangerous threats and ancient incantations , reasons why a group of explorers got trapped deep inside Philae 's Court . <p> You can access the new dungeon from Ozymand 's Temple entry , and you will have 20 minutes in total to complete it . Once finish , you wo n't be able to enter until the next day . The dungeon does n't work like a regular one : instead of defeating monsters , you will have to solve several puzzles in order to get to the next room , always related to the archeology system . And in reward , you can get several prizes , including the possibility to exchange the ancient crystals for Fenrir 's key fragments through the Adventurer Encyclopedia . <p> - New : Paragon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tables will be available from today and until August 5th . The new categories will introduce new items and bring back some fan favorites : . The new biker mounts and the neko inspired new fashion will certainly take the spotlight . <p> Bug Fixes : - " Foreign Creature " Fish King in Starstruck Plateau spawn fixed : the fish king should disappear as other fish kings normally do from now on . - Mistery Fish Couple Quest fixed : The unable to complete active mission from the guardian knight system is actually correspondent to Silent Ice Hills area . You should see the full description , and be able to obtain the drop from Silent Ice Hills fishing areas . - Bahamut 's 3* form ultimate skill for necromancer and crusader class fixed : all classes should now see the right skill and dragon form when perfoming the ultimate skill for bahamut 's 3* form . We are aware of the visual glitch and the beginning of the transformation for ALL classes , and still working to fix it . <p> As for the latest launcher problems , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's restart should help everyone 's stability issues . Despite of that , I will need to ask for your patience once again , because this issue is not completely of our control and is directly related to ISP providers in some areas . In case the bypass does n't work for you , a vpn could be helpful to get ingame . <p> As announced , and as long no major bugs comes from today 's maintenance ( which should n't ) next week will be the one for two very important additions to the game , Sky Fantasy and Monster Institute . Since it will be a big patch and we already lost one extra day of work , I can not assure you yet if the maintenance will take place on July 29 or 30 . It will also include some other announced changes . <p> As for what 's left , August 5th should be the final maintenance for level 70 content , adding Ruins Cellar and the Popularity System among other things . Once this content is done , we will start working on new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you will take possible a couple of weeks .

I 'm willing do to everything , even go to hell , just to have her become my lover . And I know a lot of people will agree with me .

@@23370528 @3370528/ 21183 @qwx221183 <h> Before entering Sky Tower <p> I know very little about proper gear , weapons and fortifications it 's really embarassing XD But Sky Tower seems like a challenge I 'd really like to take . Challenge I 'd like to take only if I do n't come as weigh to teammates , so I hope I can once again get help from this community <p> 1 . Is Gunslinger good choice for ST ? I know every class is good here and there , but is it a safe choice for someone who started AK and has no basic knoweldge of how things functionate ? After I already went far with gunslinger , I started reading they are not user friendly for beginners because , altough they deal good damage , they are far squishy , and best advice was to take up Bard or Ranger . Is it best choice for someone as clueless as me ? 2 . Altough I read things about each of ST bosses ( to prevent myself from becoming a Hel maniac ) , I am not pretty confident with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and where ? Do n't mind me for being THIS clueless , but I heard of ( yes heard of ) blue and yellow gear , so I want to ask you how do I recognize such gear and what aparts good gear from gear owned by someone who has n't spent gold on it ? 3 . I read good part of people here are getting ' ' delays ' ' . But sometimes , these delays , for me , can make me think of sudden disconnection . Altough it 's happened to me rarely , I 'd like to know if I can rejoin ST after server has kicked me out ? I highly doubt this is possible , but I just want to make sure before I am eaten by guilt . 4 . Since I am gunslinger , is it smart for me to make other players invisible to prevent chance of getting hell lags ? I am pretty sure my PC will be able to handle it , however in case it does n't , is it smart choice to turn off visibility of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> I know I am clueless and all , but I have to learn somehow . For all those who are entering ST , do n't be frightened as I am not willing to participate in any teamwork activites until I catch the ropes of this game properly . Thanks to all those who help me in advance &lt;3 <p> I would n't worry about your class , gunslinger is fine for ST , so you should be okay as long as you 're familiar with how your skills work and what they can do . And if not , there are probably guides around the forum or internet , as well as probably videos that can help . <p> The gear you should go for is probably the orange level 70 " Sniper " gear , and " Blinding Reflection " Accessory set . It 's the best for DPS classes until you can get the level 80 " Damned " gear . These armor recipes drop from level 70 Otherworld dungeons and Frozenlea Plains ( the dungeon in Silent Ice Field ) , or you can buy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or even from other players . Then you can talk to Analisa in Navea to make the actual armor . It will require a green version of the level 70 armor , and a core ( which you can make by buying the core recipe from Analisa , or buy from AH ) , and cost money to make , but it 's better than blue or yellow gear . Of course after you make the gear you should fortify it , but that works the same way as with any color gear . <p> If you get disconnected during Sky Tower , do n't worry , you can re-enter . You 'll lose a life every time you disconnect , I think , but you do start out with 15 lives . Also , it 's a good idea to hide players inside Sky Tower if you 're worried about lagging or disconnecting because of the delay . Hiding other players really helps reduce lag . <p> I hope this helps , and if I can help in any other way , or left out anything , let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unless the guild runs short on people ( which happens rarely and even so its intentional for speed runs and they only want optimal ppl in those cases. ) , the only thing you need worry about is survival and region chat . <p> Believe me , there 's more OP people who are full of themselves that are likely to mess up and troll floors than there are newbies dying often--yeah DPS hype sickness does that to you , even guards unfortunately . In the end it really comes down to how often you listen to the raid lead , and their party lieutenants . <p> Depending on the floors , you might also have distinct strengths over others ( ie. shooting chest with decoy is good example ) and timing the use of your wep specs are important as every boss has distinct nature , something even the narutarded ninjas have yet to learn ( no offense to the good ninjas I know though ) .

But as I said , its not easy to solve these problems so punishing raid saboteurs will never be so justly as everyone want . <p> I see Thank you everyone so much , once again &lt;3 I have yet to experiment with other weapons but getting over so many quests is such pain in the booty , especially those quests where you take form of someone/something else so I wanted to experience ST a bit quicker XD

@@23370533 @3370533/ <p> First and Foremost , I put this thread in this section because the admins might get some good ideas about this . This ai n't just a suggestion thread , but I want to hear people about how easy or hard to get LP at this rate . <p> Let 's start with my own opinion . <p> 1 . I think , only highbies with so many highbie alts can get a considerable amount of LP . But it also take some amount of effort to do so . <p> 2 . Skandia Solo/Solo Challenge or even Party and Hell have a very ' inconsistent ' drops . You can get as high as 100 LP ( some says 150LP ) and get as low as none . Usually I have seen lots of players who complain about wasting their time doing Skandia Solo/Solo Challenge for nothing . <p> In my case , I usually just rush my way to the boss . And I get around 30-50 LP per run if lucky . <p> 3 . World Bosses , that 's one of the ways to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , world boss is bugged and being ' owned ' by a group of few people who wish to get WB all for themselves . <p> 4 . Eidolon Temples , they pretty much drop inconsistent too . They only get a better chance if you pick the level 60 boxes . <p> 5 . Sky Tower ... Dang ... All I get are craploads of Azurian poop-- I mean crystal . ( Yes , using lucky card and treasure charms will just add azurian crap too . ) <p> Basing on my opinions . There is one thing that is observed . <p> ' Drops of LP is so inconsistent . ' Well , it happens , its as normal as people win some and lose some . But I think , if we at least make the LP drop from bosses a bit more consistent . it will help to boost the players morale for farming . Ya know , the feeling of farming and our efforts actually pay off is already enough to keep us going . <p> ... And yes , less crap stuff like azurian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one point . <p> My suggestion regarding the matter , I think that raising the drop rate for LP will help , drop rate that is enough to at least make a person earn a bit more consistent amount of LP . <p> Feel free to share your ideas . <p> katielin <p> 05-12-2014 , 04:40 AM <p> hi , am not dissing u , but rather providing an alternative view on why lp drop rate is op as it is <p> 1 .

@@23370534 @3370534/ <p> I just started game on server about 4 days ago , decided to pick Tachi and loved it so far . I just have a few questions about what stats I should use and what kind of build I should be using for leveling 40+ and noticed I can use a secondary class but so lost on what to do . My character on game is Genkai if anyone would mind sending me a pm or friend request . I do understand some stuff in the game but still learning as i go , and thank you for any help you throw my way : ) <p> 0maru360 <p> 05-13-2014 , 10:41 PM <p> And i 'll post what i have done so far on my Tachi shown with 2 pictures . I still have n't chosen An envoy path yet and not sure what i should do on this if anyone could help . <p> 1054 <p> 1055 <p> KawaiiDesuPoo <p> 05-13-2014 , 11:36 PM <p> Welcome : 3 Tachis have combo skills with wizard and katars . So if you would like to use combo skills , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ choose whichever class you like . Your stats are not bad . Tachis get crit from their envoys ( Tachi and Blades Technique : Tide ) . Some people say that because of Tide ( CRIT +3% for 120 secs while attacking , stacking up to 20 times . Stacks will disappear once you 've dealt CRIT damage ) you do n't need to stat crit , or just put a little bit of it . You could go a lot of ways with your stats . You could put 30% speed to help with cool downs a bit and then put the rest on crit or damage . You could also drop speed and go for a mix of crit ( 50% crit should suffice ) and damage . <p> Your defensive stats are not bad either . Tachis do n't have a lot of HP compared to other classes , so you do need to put some points into it . However , you can get extra HP if you get the envoy Steel Body . For Steel Body , you need crit . Steel Body adds HP @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ IIRC from game ) . They also do n't get that much defense , so you need to put some points there ( you probably wo n't need to put much points here once you fortify your armor . Do this once you hit 60+ ) . Tachi is an evasive class , so you do need some evasion sooner or later . <p> You can see their envoy path and skills here : LONG ... I suggest you take all Katana Studies ( Reyva : Ronin Studies ) , Blades Techique : Soul ( Reyva : Soul Breaker ) , Swift-Footed Lv1 ( Fleet Footed ) and Charged Jump . The reason you need these is because you need movement speed in order to dodge red carpets from bosses . I also suggest you take Sacred Dragon Slash . If you would like crit , take Blades Technique : Tide ( Reyva : Raging Waves ) . If you 're stacking evasion , Infinity ( Reyva : Infinite Waltz ) and if you would like more HP , Body of Steel ( Reyva : Steel Body ) . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can reset your stats and envoy with gold , so you 're free to experiment with your envoy and stats . Not satisfied ? Change it ! <p> 0maru360 <p> 05-14-2014 , 01:37 AM <p> Still do n't  know what sub class to choose , Ive seen ppl using Wizard with tachi . Is that useful for solo ? <p> Tachi 's are pretty easy to build in my opinion . For now , try focusing on DMG . You 'll need that . A little points on Crit will do , like make it maintain around 45% and your Tide envoy will do the rest . <p> Here 's my Envoy path . Lv 57 <p> http : **28;16080;TOOLONG <p> As you can see , I took all the crit slots . I did n't take the crit rate when you 're wearing Katana so I can put add some more utility slots , like the HP , charged Jump and Fleet Footed . I also did n't take the DMG slots since I 'm Full DMG . <p> Here 's my stat build : <p> http : **29;16110;TOOLONG @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and No eidolon . My set is +9 except the upper which is +7 , so Def is kinda higher than usual . Not recommending this stat build , this is just an experiment build anyways : 3 <p> 0maru360 <p> 05-14-2014 , 04:23 AM <p> Thank you everyone for the help , i got my char all set up and up to level 45 now with Tachi/Katar and loving the class so far . Is the loyalty 7000 shop item that comes with the Eidolon and the 2 costume pieces worth it ? Was thinking of buying some ap points prob after next week . <p> Jico <p> 05-14-2014 , 05:06 AM <p> Is the loyalty 7000 shop item that comes with the Eidolon and the 2 costume pieces worth it ?

Goodluck on Tachi ! : ) <p> Kure <p> 05-14-2014 , 06:10 AM <p> Tide envoy is helpful , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Think on it this way : each time it ups your chance to crit is a hit when you 're " not " critting . The worse you 're doing , the more it 's helping , but you 're still doing worse . My own thoughts on it . It 's annoying though . I 'm fairly sure there 's a mathamatical way to express how much it helps , a way that is at least somewhat understandable to the average gamer , but I just ca n't quite see it ( or bother to see it ... Could be because I personally am not a fan of the glass . Err ... class. )

In addition to the scene so we spent a lot of thought presented to adjust outside source interaction between players and Eidolons we are very focused on the topic . <p> In a recent Aura Kingdom update in addition to dialogue with the players and has unique memories , they can also express their wishes to the players . For example Eve might complain to your recent wet weather , causing her hair is not good , want to maintain her hair . Apollo heard a region or suffer Monster invasion , he hope you went to the crusade against monsters . Through listening to the aspirations of Eidolons and help them to achieve thus enhance the mutual interaction , is the system design philosophy . <p> Card Battle System <p> Card battle system is one of the key updates during the summer . Players can get a card through the game @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other players or play against the games NPC . NPC and Eidolons will have the exclusive card and have the high and or low points . Good luck to collect these cards and enjoy the battle is the biggest feature of this system . <p> Follow the story of the Black Knight <p> Black Knight story line will have further development in the next update , players will once again battle with the Black Knight . In addition to in unexpected developments outside a nasty character by many players there are a lot of movie stars .

@@23370543 @3370543/ 21183 @qwx221183 <h> Starter eidolons and Eidolon Temple Summon Stones <p> Starter Eidolons : Starter eidolons are rather crappy for the most part , and considering they are un-returnable , that 's kind of a let-down , you would think that all eidolons would be equal in power but in different respective areas . I would like to suggest raising either A. the stats that the eidolon gains by evolving , or B. the possible amount of stats they can gain from crests . This would make it so that the eidolon is still not that great in the beginning , but can be on par with other eidolons once evolved , or crested enough . So you would still have to work to make this eidolon a success , but once done it would be as valuable as the others . That is my main suggestion for Eidolons . <p> If this suggestion is not received well enough , and people are thinking , " Do n't make starters OP ! You 'll reduce the importance of getting new ones ! " . This is a somewhat true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other ones that the others are just as important . However , if it is still not really a well liked idea , you could simply make them able to be returned to the list so that no one will ever use them again and just keep them in the Eidolon house thing , lol . <p> Eidolon Temple : K this did n't really bug me until last night where the server crashed while I was in Eidolon Temple fighting eidolons trying to get frags , etc . Then I logged back in after the server issue was supposed to be fixed , ET reset , crashed again . That kind of upset me , and yes I am complaining a bit but that would be expected , and I apologize if it bugs you for me complaining . However , I think this is a good enough idea on it 's own and , as far as I can see , has NO drawbacks or ways to abuse it , so here it is : <p> If possible , please make the summon stones from Eidolon Temple NOT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many ways , and , though if the server crashes while you 're fighting an Eidolon , you may lose one of your precious stones , you at least will still have the others to use on your next ET run . You may not be able to stop the crash from ruining your current ET run , but at least the next time you go in you 'll still have your eidolons from the last one to fight . <p> If neither of these are possible , I am sorry for wasting your time in reading this suggestion , but I think these ideas would be fairly nice if implemented correctly , and in my mind , they do not seem to be over the top if they are possible . I do at least believe changing stats of eidolons IS possible though , but if you do n't want to do that , again , sorry for wasting your time . <p> I do n't want to keep you waiting for a response , since you have clearly put a lot of dedication on writting the suggestion in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have already read what you wrote ; but I can only give you an incomplete answer for the moment . Coding speaking I 'm not sure if what you suggest its even possible . So I have to discuss this with our dev 's team and see if it can be implemented in the first place . In case it can , then we could discuss if it will be a good idea or not , but I do n't want to start a debate without knowing if it 's actually possible or not . <p> Thank you for your quick response . I just wanted to get the ideas up there in a more easy to access area so that they were at least thought about . If they 're not possible , too bad , if they are , hope the discussion goes well ( At least about the summon stones , eidolons not too terribly worried , just upsetting to see Grimm just sit in my list all day long and never be used )

And that 's because something is blocking the manual from completing the process . So a few tips : <p> 1 ) Before starting the converting process , make sure to make a copy of the client . Right click upon AeriaGames &gt; Aura Kingdom , and then just copy it in your desktop . 2 ) Remember , the Aeria 's version must be updated before you start . 3 ) Once you made the copy , rename it . 4 ) Download the manual patch .

Several things could be : firewall , antivirus , or the same windows restrictions you have . In that case , try also running the manual patch as admin , turn off your windows UAC ( go to Control Panel &gt; System and Security &gt; Activity Center &gt; Change User Accounts Settings and place the bar into the minimum ) and add the manual patch and the launcher after you patch to your firewall/antivirus exceptions . <p> Penguin , you have to install your game already , I need you !
