These kids are the most hilarious little humans you will ever meet . They are sassy , sharp and full of love . These are kids who never say " no " to a dance party , whether it be in our living room or in the car . One of my most cherished memories , will be when my 8-year-old little girl , in the middle of helping me clean up in the kitchen said : " Maja , come here " , took my hand , lead me into the living room and invited me to a slow dance . If I could have captured that moment forever , I would have . They are also kids who , when I am having a bad day , recognize that and are there for me . When they see that I am sad , they will automatically argue less when getting dressed or eating their breakfast . When I make a mistake they will tell me that " Its OK , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

From going to church on Sunday mornings to road trips down the East Coast , to family vacations to Marthas Vineyard and Cape Cod with their extended family . <p> The McMorrow family has made Maja feel at home from the moment she walked in the front door . <p> This family is extraordinary , because when you are an au pair in this family , you are loved , not just by them , but by everyone in their extended family .

With a support system like this , how can you not have a wonderful year ? <p> Having a host family that believes in her 100% has made Majas year even better than she could imagine . <p> I simply can not thank them enough for the life I have here . They truly believe in me . They are able to let go and let me do my own thing , which I know can be hard for a lot of people . They trust me completely with a lot of responsibilities at home and with the kids , but more importantly , they trust me to make the best decision in a new situation . They know that I will do my best . They supported any decision I had to make . And I really feel that .

Nati , an au pair for the Cook family in Illinois , has been chosen as Cultural Care Au Pairs 2016 Au Pair of the Year award winner . Says Shannon , " Nati and all of the other au pairs were at a restaurant going over the Household Poisoning Safety Unit as part of our monthly meeting . I sent a quick text message to the host family to let them know when we were done , and they arrived at the restaurant to surprice Natalia . When they walked up to the table and the kids embraced Nati with warm hugs , kisses and flowers , she was surprised and confused to see them . I believe she was even more shocked to hear that she had won and would be receiving an airline voucher so she could return to the U.S. and reunite with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smiling so big and all she could do was thank the family over and over . It was truly a very happy moment . Nati is truly a lovely woman that I am proud to call my friend . " <p> It is our honor to share part of the Cook familys essay nominating Nati for this award ! <p> Nati was shocked to learn she had won Cultural Cares Au Pair of the Year award , including a plane voucher to return to see her host family one day . <p> We have a very busy home with three young children , an unusually needy dog , a mom in school , and a dad mostly working 200 miles away . It has been a year filled with many changes and challenges , and Nati has been integral in holding things together so our family can thrive . When Nati first arrived in late spring , our children were 4 , 2 , and 5 months . In the fall , our oldest started kindergarten , and mom returned to school after taking a year away for the birth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the summer , a change in dads job meant he needed to be in Chicago ( 200 miles north ) four days per week .

She was also adjusting to mom being away from home after being home for the past year , and to dad being away from home for days at a time each week . Nati seemed to intuitively recognize the potential for our middle child to have a difficult time and carefully created a structured day , filled with school-like activities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time for singing , art , reading , games , coloring , snacks , and time for short videos once all was done . <p> The Cook family has been " absolutely blown away " by the love Nati shows for their children . <p> She managed to pull all this off while still providing a loving , safe , and stimulating environment for our youngest . As an infant , that means regular diaper changes , feeding , handling bottles , and naps . She has remained attentive to his gross motor skills development and provided tummy time and helped him first use a walker . And she has been his biggest cheerleader as he has reached each major milestone : eating , crawling , standing , soon walking , and so on . <p> Nati shares her culture with her family in so many ways , including her passion for Colombian futbol . <p> In addition , she took our oldest to and from kindergarten , not an easy task with two younger children in tow ! She remained attentive to our oldests concerns as he began school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each day when he was anxious about walking in himself . Upon picking him up from school , she always made sure his homework was started and kept track of all his school notes and belongings . Many times , she would take all three children on trips to the park , to the ice cream shop , to our neighborhood recreation center . Moreover , she planned many intricate and engaging arts and crafts projects for all three kids to do together ! In addition , she has helped us countless times with preparing meals , keeping the house clean , laundry , home maintenance . Simply put : she is amazing ! <p> Nati helped her middle host child adjust to many changes during her time with the Cook family . <p> Nati has generously shared her traditions around holidays and birthdays . We have also learned about Colombian cuisine . Our family all made arepas and empanadas together from scratch . We have also learned to share her passion for Colombian futbol ( soccer ) .

She has also been genuinely excited to be a part of our traditions . She is eager to try new foods , join in on celebrations and activities , as well as travel with us to meet our extended family . Nati and our family have truly enjoyed our mutual cultural exchange . <p> Nati is an exemplar of being : open-minded , non-judgmental , patient , loving , caring , smart , artistic , creative , organized , responsible , dedicated , hardworking , friendly , curious , and thoughtful . She has been more than an amazing au pair , she has become a beloved family member and role model that we want our children to learn from and strive to be like .

Her host mom says simply , " Frannie is awesome " , and it appears that her host kids feel the same way . Her story in her own words is below . <p> I am Francesca , I am 20 years old and I come from Italy . I live in Manhattan and I take care of four children : 2 1/2- , 4 1/2- , 6- and 7-years-old . They call me Franniethey have always called me that , even before I arrived here ! I came to the U.S. in January 2015 so I 've been here for almost 8 months . I would never regret becoming an au pair , and my host kids are the reason why . These are 10 reasons I love taking care of my host kids . <p> 1 . They care about me , they care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They want to learn Italian words , they asked me to teach them my language . So far they know the numbers , the days of the week and some types of food . Even the little one , and she is just 2-and-a-half ! Every time they see something related to Italy in a movie , in a cartoon or in a book , they call me so excited telling me " Look Frannie , Italy ! " <p> 2 . I am so glad that they consider me as part of their family . Most of the time , when they draw family pictures , there 's a seventh person , and that person is me . Mom and Dad , four children , and me . It makes me feel so blessed to have found them . I do feel so loved . They are my " American family " . <p> 3 . With four kids you are never be boredbeing with them all day long is kind of like being at a party everyday ! We play lots of games together , of every kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always find a way to keep us busy , everybody has a role and we are perfectly organized . For example , sometimes we bake or cook something together and each kid has something different to do . <p> 4 . I like the fact that they are four and they work together as a team . They support and love each other in an amazing way , and they taught me a lot ! Before taking care of them I could n't feel and know the importance of so many little things . <p> 5 . Being surrounded by them makes me feel so loved because they are very loving kids . They hug me , jump on me , climb on me all the time and every night , before going to bed , they come to my room to give me a hug and kiss goodnight , always . <p> 6 . They help and teach each other how to behave and how to be good kids , they explain each other when there 's something wrong without me telling them . They already know what could make me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done . <p> 7 . They know what respect is . I love the fact that they do n't  bear a grudge for something they know its wrong , but they immediately say sorry and ask for forgiveness . When I put them in " time out " they do n't  complain about it , they just understand that this is how it works , they do n't  even dare to resist and not listen to me . They respect me as a person and as their au pair , they know I am here to build a long term relationship and that its not just for " fun " . <p> 8 . Maybe it would sound silly , but I feel so proud when I am at the park or at the playground with the kids and people look at me impressed , because I am young and I take care of four children . Sometimes some people come to me saying " You are brave , you have to be proud of yourself ! " and I actually am ! Taking care of four kids is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! <p> 9 .

Being an au pair of 4 kids , ( or even one or two ) makes you realize what being a mom is like . This experience prepares you for your own future child , and you appreciate your own mom more than ever ! I understood how hard it is , and I will always thank my mom for doing such an amazing job and never complaining about it ! <p> Taking care of my host kids makes me feel stronger and wiser . I 've really grown as a person , and after this year I will certainly look at the world with different eyes . <p> Congratulations to you Frannie for being your host childrens activity coordinator , disciplinarian , playmate and friend every day .

Au pairs can perform household duties related to the children .

We recommend thinking about how much time you 'd like to spend together as a family with your au pair and outline those thoughts with au pair candidates during the matching process . Some au pairs are very family-oriented and want to spend free time with the family . Other au pairs are quite independent and will tend to spend their free time outside the home . Finding the right mix between your au pairs and your desired level of interaction is important .

@@41904104 @1904104/ <h> The truth about nanny shares <p> February 21 , 2014 <p> Trying to find affordable childcare these days is a big challenge for many families . One of the newer trends that has emerged as the cost of childcare continues to rise is the idea of a nanny share . A nanny share is an arrangement where two or more families split the cost of one nanny who either cares for all of the children together or divides her time between the two families . <p> How do you find a nanny share ? <p> Finding a nanny share can be more challenging than simply finding a nanny because of the other parties involved . On top of searching for a nanny , you need to find another family or families who want to share the nanny with you as well . Some people find the nanny first and then look for a family to share with , while others start with another family and then look to hire a nanny together . <p> Either way , you may have to do a lot of searching and interviewing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ share . Your online resources can range from big national nanny finder websites to online neighborhood groups for parents . Do an online search for resources in your area , or ask your neighbors and friends for their recommendations . There are also forums and message boards where nannies or other families may post resumes or nanny job openings . <h> Benefits of a nanny share <p> Cost The main reason people choose a nanny share arrangement is to make having a nanny more affordable . The cost of a nanny share can vary depending on factors like where you live , the number of children the nanny will care for , the total number of hours the nanny will work , the nannys experience , and whether or not you will include benefits like paid vacation , sick days , health insurance , transportation reimbursement , and more . When interviewing nannies for a nanny share , you might encounter applicants who are recent graduates and ask for $12/hour up to career nannies who ask for $25/hour plus benefits . Keep in mind , you will also have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your children A nanny share can be a nice alternative to daycare if socialization is one of your priorities . By having your child or children together with another familys children , they will learn social skills like sharing , imaginative play , compromise and adaptability . Since the nanny share will include less children than the number of children in a daycare , the exposure to illness might be lower and there would be more adult attention available to each child . <p> Convenience of in-home care Some families arrange their nanny share to alternate between the families houses , either on a weekly or monthly basis . Others choose one of the families homes due to the size , location or other factors . Many families like having a nanny in their home , at least part of the time , since it reduces stress around drop-offs and pick-ups . Additionally , you may include some light housework as part of the nannys job responsibilities . <h> What are the challenges of a nanny share ? <p> Finding the right family and nanny A successful nanny share depends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your familys needs . Even if everything about them looks good on paper , a relationship with a minimum of 3 parties requires a significant amount of compromise . Start out on the right foot by drafting a nanny contract that everyone agrees to , and try to outline as many contingencies as you can in advance . At a minimum , you should include : pay rate and timing of payment , description of nannys childcare and household duties , sick policy for the nanny and children , vacation policy , termination policy , qualification requirements such as CPR and First Aid certifications , criminal background check , clean driving record , timing and frequency of regular group meetings and whatever else you feel is important . <p> LogisticsCoordinating childcare with another family and a nanny can be challenging . Discuss in advance your schedule and expectations for work hours and vacation time as well as your expectations for maintaining a safe environment for the children . Here are some important questions to discuss : What happens if one family is running late ? Will both families take vacation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same ? Do you need the nanny to drive the children to and from activities ? How will food and other supplies like diapers be provided and prepared ? What happens when the nanny is sick ? <p> Parenting styles Its important to discuss how you want your child cared for with both the nanny and the other family . For example , you may allow your child to watch TV but the other family does not . You may want to sign your child up for music , art and other educational classes each day , while the other family does n't  want to spend the extra money , or the nanny might not want to schlep the kids all over town each day . <p> Additional children What happens when one or both of the families has another baby ? Is the nanny comfortable with caring for more children ? Can the schedules for the older kids accommodate the baby ? Some families find that they have to give up their nanny share when a new baby arrives because the logistics become too difficult or the responsibilities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ try to discuss this scenario in advance to get a sense of each others comfort levels . <h> The key to success <p> The key to success in a nanny share is ultimately lots of communication and honesty .

Do your research , trust your gut and then communicate as much as possible and hopefully everything will work out for the best . <p> If you feel that organizing a nanny share is too much work or too inconvenient , or you cant seem to find the right family or nanny to do the share with , you might want to consider other alternatives like getting your own nanny , or hosting an au pair .

" Kate , a FTWM turned SAHM with two young children who are watched once a week by her mother or mother-in-law shares , " It is really so comforting to know that my children are with people who love them as much as I do . Also , I never have to worry about whether or not the kids will be welcome if they are sick or grumpy . " Adds Katarina , another mom of two : " It makes me feel slightly less guilty being at work all day since its family helping to raise our children .

But , she says , " Personal family politics got in the way . The short of it is : she does n't  like me and we have a history that isnt so rosy . " She ultimately decided to put her then-13-week-old son into full time family daycare . <p> Danielle , a single mom living in Colorado , admitted that " Although my mom did n't  expect to be paid for taking care of my daughter Maddie , she felt that she because she was doing me such a huge favor she deserved to spend all holidays and free time with us . If Maddie and I went on vacation with friends instead of her , she would actually get passive-aggressive and pouty about it . It got to the point where it was n't worth it anymore . Even though I saved money and my daughter loved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an au pair . It works much better for us . " <p> So , how do you determine whether choosing your family member over another provider will turn out to be a childcare dream or nightmare ? To start , ask yourself the following 5 questions and think carefully about the answers : <p> 1 . Does your relative want the job ? Enlisting the help of a relative to care for your children may sound like a great idea to you but you need to make sure the person you have in mind truly wants to take on such a big responsibility . In the case of all of the moms I spoke to , their relatives were more than happy to care for their children and in some instances , had specifically requested the gig . <p> Says Anna , " In my mother-in-laws Eastern European culture , its what you do . She definitely feels like this is her purpose in life right now , and she 's excited to be able to spend time with her grandkids whenever she can . " Rachel , a mom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WThF , relies on her mother-in-law for coverage on Mondays and Tuesdays . She says her mother-in-law , " put the offer out there originally . The largest driving factor is to spend time with her grandson and that is great . " <p> 2 . Can you tell your relative what to do ? ( And will she listen to you ? ) Giving specific directions to a daycare center , au pair or nanny about how to care for your children is easy . You are paying them for a job so that makes you the boss . Its not so easy with a family member . With a relative , its often harder to give orders and as well as deal with the consequences if she does n't  follow them . <p> Helen says , " I was n't convinced my mother-in-law would do it my way . She was raised in a different time and place . I was n't sure she would follow the latest practices when it comes to raising childrenputting him to sleep on his back , ensuring proper restraints in the high chair/stroller/car , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scoff at these measures , calling them over-protective . Several of my friends who have older family members care for their kids struggle with this issue . " <p> Rachels sentiments are similar . " I can tell her what to dobut its hard . She agrees to do everything the way I want her to do it but she will passively question me . Or quietly do otherwise . For example , she will change Cole because she thinks I dress him in clothes that are too small . Instead of just bringing up with me , she just changes him on her own . I know she 's thinking , I know what I 'm doing , I raised 4 kids. I knew it would be hard . But its harder than I thought it would be . " <p> " There were compromises that were difficult for me in the beginning , " says Kate , another Massachusetts mom with two young children . " We use cloth diapers but my mother-in-law does n't  want to use them at her house , so she uses disposables there . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ car because they wo n't take naps at home if they do , but she sometimes let 's them fall asleep on their way here or there . Overall , though , the pros for us have far out-weighed the cons when it comes to the favor that this super-grandma has extended to us . " <p> Even Anna , the mom who ca n't seem to say enough positive things about her situation says that her mother-in-law let 's her kids eat more candy than they should and does n't  restrict computer screen time like she 's been asked to . " She does n't  want to say no to the kids . She wants to spoil them all the time . " <p> 3 . Is your relative physically capable of caring for your children ? Your childcare provider should be healthy and strong enough not only to keep your children safe and fulfill their basic needs but also to really get down on the ground and play with them and engage them in outdoor activity . This is especially true for babies and toddlers . Sometimes its hard to be an impartial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question carefully and ask for second opinions . If you have any doubts , its a smart idea to set up a trial run before committing to a long-term arrangement . <p> Helen said she felt pretty sure her mother-in-law , in the condition she is in , would just have her son playing inside while she watches TV . On the other hand , Anna was pleasantly surprised to find that her mother-in-laws health actually improved after she started caring for her two children . " I never questioned her physical ability to begin with . And now , she 's younger and in better shape from taking care of our kids . I think its actually been good for her health . " <p> 4 . Is your relative committed to the job ? An unreliable childcare provider is every parents worst nightmare . So make sure your relative recognizes the importance of showing up every day on time so you can get to work . Even if she 's not being paid ( although we recommend otherwise ) , and you do n't  operate under a formal contract ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your children should know that its not ok to bail on their responsibilities if something better comes along . <p> Anna laughs as she admits that , " my mother-in-law lives on the top floor of our house , so its kind of impossible for her to play hookie . " On the other hand , Kate shares , " Now that I am not working and use the childcare coverage as time to get things done around the house , its not uncommon for my mother-in-law to cancel . I cant really say I blame hershe has a life and a home and a job of her own . " <p> 5 . Is your relative willing to respect your familys limits ? When parents arrive home , au pairs and nannies are usually ready to end their shift and get on with their own personal lives . Family members ? Some of them prefer to linger a bit more . If you crave private time at the end of the day with your family , you have to be willing to set limits and be ready to confront @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Anna feels her situation is unique in that , " my mother-in-law lives with us but when I 'm home , I hardly see her . Shes done and she goes and does her own thing . Even if she 's made dinner she disappears . I may see her for two minutes tops . So we definitely get enough privacy . I should also mention that we do n't  speak the same language so in that case , it may be a little easier . " <p> Rachels situation is a little bit different . She explains , " For the first few months , my mother-in-law was watching my son Cole Thursdays and Fridays and staying over on Thursdays . She absolutely loved it . But for me , it was way too much together time . Part of it is that she made it really hard for me to take over . She has a hard time stepping away and letting me care for Cole when I 'm back in the picture . " <p> Danielle had similar challenges when her mom was caring for her daughter Maddie . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weekend if I let her , " she laughs . " My mom also knew there were certain things that I wanted to do with Maddie first . Like take her to see the Nutcracker and buy her the American doll that that she wanted . My mom felt that she had the right to do these things because she did so much for us . Now that she is just a occasional visitor again , my mom does n't  have as much opportunity to hijack the experiences that should be mine . We are all happier for it . " <p> At the end of the day , the mothers I spoke to who use relatives to provide childcare were all extremely grateful that they had family to step in to help . Even those who chose not to use willing relatives recognized that they were lucky enough to count family as an option . However , hiring a relative to care for your kids can be a tricky business .

Making your house rules and regulations known from the start eliminates any confusion and sets expectations for everyone involved . Our Host Family Handbook provides additional insight into how to set household rules . <p> Au Pair Car UseYoull want to think carefully about what your familys guidelines will be regarding car use .

Because your au pair is a " family member , " you should consider what rules you would consider reasonable for your own adult children . While an au pair should recognize that use of a car during her year is a privilege , not a right , giving your au pair access to a car will help her feel less isolated and more independent during the year , especially if you live in an area with limited public transportation . <p> Au Pair Phone UseMost host families agree that providing a cell phone for their au pairs is necessary so they may get in touch with her both while she 's on duty and off .

Most families give their au pairs a curfew based on when and if she will be on duty the next day . An earlier curfew on weeknights is reasonable and ensures your au pair has time to get enough rest so she can fulfill her duties . On weekends , au pairs generally expect to be out later .

According to Cultural Care Au Pairs policy , this includes : <p> Doing the childrens laundry <p> Picking up their rooms <p> Preparing their meals <p> As long as these duties are performed within their 45-hour a week and 10-hour per day limit , they are all reasonable tasks .

" its a question that many families ask us , and with good reason . The trend towards downsizing these days means families are living in less square footage than in years past . Space comes at an even bigger premium in urban areas so this is a particular concern for families living in places like New York City , Boston , San Francisco , Seattle and Washington D.C. <p> In fact , there are no rules governing how big a host familys home must be in order to host an au pair . The U.S. Department of State , which regulates the au pair program , dictates only that an au pair must have her or his own private bedroom . <p> That being said , there are still plenty of parents who express concern over hosting an au pair in a house without loads of extra room . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ au pair wont have enough of her own . <p> When I asked Krista Rietberg , a local childcare coordinator ( LCC ) for Cultural Care Au Pair in Seattle , WA , to speak on this topic , her reply was : " Sure .

" <p> In addition to being an LCC , Krista was also a host mom for 6 years ( she recently retired from the program due to her childrens ages ) . She lives with her three children in a 1,400 square foot house with 4 bedrooms and one bathroom . <p> Says Krista , " Our daughters shared a room on the main floor where the au pairs bedroom also was .

" <p> Jenn Guarracino and her family have hosted 4 au pairs in big homes and in small . <p> Jenn Guarracino is a Cultural Care host mom whose family has lived in both small and large quarters with their four au pairs . Ironically , she says , " When we were living in our 1,250 square foot condo in Boston we probably had the most privacy .

Before our au pairs arrive , we are insistent that on " off hours " they feel comfortable doing whatever they would like to do . We do n't  take " offense " if our au pairs do n't  want to hang out with us and this has worked out well . <p> Bob Mitchell , Senior Director of Placement at Cultural Care Au Pair , says that families should be upfront about their personal needs and expectations during interviews with au pairs to make sure whoever they choose is a good match @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to become an integral part of the family or if they prefer more private time with each other and their children , this should be discussed during the phone interviews .

They want to feel like a family member . My house is small and crazy and my au pairs have loved it . " Jenn Guarracino agrees . " Au pairs might be initially impressed with host family applications that include photos of big , beautiful homes , but they learn that what will really ensure a happy au pair year is a good relationship with their host family .

Recent news headlines have been calling attention to a new Pew Research Center Report showing that the percentage of moms staying at home to raise their children is the highest it has been in two decades at 29%and they are staying home largely due to the high cost of childcare . <p> I remember thinking how much you hear about saving early for your childrens college educations , but the reality is that a year of infant childcare is more expensive than a year of college tuition at a public college in most parts of the country . I felt completely unprepared for the expense of full-time daycare or hiring a nanny , since with childcare , you do n't  have 18 years to plan and save for the costs .

" <p> November 3 , 2015 <p> Congratulations to German au pair Dana Hirsch who just completed the NYC Marathon . The idea to train for and run the marathon popped into her head after she attended a class near the marathon route , and she spent many months afterward training for the run and raising money for her charity . She tells us more about this life-changing experience below . <p> How did you decide to run this marathon ? I am in my second year as an au pair with my wonderful host family and last year I happened to have class in Harlem , right by the marathon route . So I thought : " I could do that , right ? Run the NYC Marathon ? " A few months and lots of research later , I signed up and started training . I like challenges , and this marathonfundraising and training and everything in betweenhas been one of the biggest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever run a marathon before ? No . The longest race Ive run ( competitively ) was a 5K . But you have to start somewhere , right ? <p> What was your training like ? I trained on my own since I had to fit it in with my work schedule . My host family was a big help , making sure I had breaks long enough to go for my run during daylight hours and supporting my plans to run this marathon . The training itself was n't always easy . Motivation was a big issue during the summer since it was always hot and humid , no matter how early or late I ran . Over 1,000 miles , a complete change in my diet , and many pairs of running shoes later I finally felt ready for the marathon . Even though the training was hard and I thought about giving up many times , I never did . And in the end it was all worth it . <p> What organization did you run for and how did you fundraise ? I raised $2,633 for Team @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my parents , who distributed letters about my charity in my hometown . My host parents both made very generous donations . The rest I raised by having lemonade stands , bake sales , and writing lots of essays about all the wonderful programs Team for Kids provides for children in the U.S. I am just so grateful to my family and all my friends , old and new , who donated and supported my effortsI could n't have done it without them . <p> Were you nervous before the race ? I went through phases of terror and excitement . Terror because 26.2 miles is LONG . Not just distancebut also duration-wise . Its a physical challenge as well as a psychological challenge . Excitement because it was the NYC marathon ! I trained for seven months ! I was not going to give up . <p> Who was there to cheer for you ? My host family was there and one of my kids even made a sign for me ( she 's five and the sign absolutely adorable ) . My parents are also currently visiting so they came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it go ? The marathon went great ! My official time was 5:43:44 . My goal was to do it in under 6 hours so that worked out well ! I think the NYC Marathon is a great first marathon for many reasons . For one , its an easy course . Yes , there are some minor hills ( mostly bridges ) but even if it looks bad at first you can honestly barely feel the elevation while running . Another reason is that its the most technologically advanced race worldwide . As soon as you get to the Start Village on Staten Island , you have absolutely nothing to worry about because the staff will get you where you need to go , your bib has a tracker on it to measure your time as you pass through the checkpoints along the course , and countless volunteers provide more Gatorade , water , snacks , and medical help than you could ever need . But the most important reason : its an absolutely beautiful race . Running though all five boroughs gave me a beautiful view of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NYC is truly beautiful . And even though everyone ran their own race , we all fought together that day . When you cross that finish line at the end , all the hard work is suddenly all worth it for that one moment of victory . I 'm going to cross this off my bucket list as one of the biggest achievements in my life so far . <p> Thanks to Dana for sharing her story and inspiring the Cultural Care community to set and achieve goals big and small . If you have an inspiring story to tell , we want to hear about it ! Share your story with us.

Not all au pair agencies are the same , and we hope to help you uncover the main differences between them so that you can choose the best au pair agency for your family . This article will cover differences in au pair agencies costs . Stay tuned for posts on the differences in how au pair agencies recruit au pairs and how au pair agencies work with host families . <p> Au pair agenciesthe basics <p> The U.S. Department of State officially recognizes 14 au pair agencies . According to their website , au pair agencies or sponsors are required to screen host families and au pairs , provide au pairs with training and orientation and ensure that au pairs do not work more than 45 hours a week and 10 hours per day . However , au pair agencies are not all the same . Agencies can vary significantly on many aspects including costs , how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ level of support they provide to host families . <p> Au pair agency costs <p> Au pair agencies charge fees to host families in exchange for recruiting , screening and training au pairs as well as managing the matching process , visa process and travel arrangements for the au pair and host family . Once the au pair arrives to the host family , the au pair agency provides year-round support to the au pair and host family , both locally and from the central office . <p> Au pair agencies do not all cost the same , however . Fees can vary significantly , so it is important to consider all of the costs that the au pair agencies charge , not just the program fee . Some of the fees au pair agencies generally charge are : <p> Application fee : This fee is generally charged by au pair agencies when a family applies to the au pair program . This indicates that you are ready to start interviewing au pairs from that agencys selection of au pair candidates . <p> Selection fee : Many au pair agencies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family has chosen their au pair . This fee indicates that the au pair agency can work with the au pair to start the process of getting their J-1 visa and making travel arrangements to come to the U.S. <p> Program fee : The program fee covers the costs of the services the au pair agencies provide . Here is what Cultural Care Au Pairs program fee includes : <p> Additional au pair agency costs : Some au pair agencies charge extra for different programs . For example , they may charge a higher fee for au pairs who are infant qualified or for au pairs who have professional childcare experience . Other au pair agencies , like Cultural Care Au Pair , do not charge for additional qualifications . Depending on where you live , you may also need to pay a domestic transportation fee to get your au pair to your home town . Cultural Care Au Pairs program fees include round-trip international airfare to fly au pairs to the training school in Oakdale , New York . <p> Other au pair costs : In addition to what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pay a weekly stipend directly to the au pair . This amount is decided by the U.S. Department of State and is the same regardless of which au pair agency you use . Additionally , the U.S. State Department requires host families to contribute up to $500 towards their au pairs educational component . <p> When you compare the au pair agencies on cost , do n't  forget to also consider the timing of the fees . Many au pair agencies have high application fees over $300 . Cultural Care Au Pair has a low application fee of only $75 , so host families can start searching for available au pairs without having to pay much . Application fees are generally not refundable , so remember that this will be a sunk cost if you decide not to go with that au pair agency after you apply . <p> Additionally , au pair agencies may require different portions of the program fee to be paid at different times . Some au pair agencies , like Cultural Care Au Pair may offer extended payment plans , so do n't  forget to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discounts <p> Au pair agencies may have discounts you can qualify for . For example , Cultural Care Au Pair offers the following au pair agency discounts to host families : <p> Military family discount : save $575 <p> Make the Switch : Families who come to Cultural Care from another au pair agency save up to $1,000 ! <p> Pre-arranged match discount : Families who find their own future au pair are entitled to a $300 program fee discount . <p> Host family referral program : earn $250 for every family you refer who welcomes an au pair <p> Of course cost is n't everything when you 're looking for quality childcare .

@@41904129 @1904129/ <h> The challenges of working from home : how au pair childcare can help <p> March 4 , 2013 <p> Whether you work from home because you run your own business or because your employer as well as your role within the company allow you to telecommute , there are several challenges to working from home . Marissa Mayer , Yahoo CEO , recently banned employees from working at home because of some of these challenges saying that it was " critical that we are all present in our offices . " <p> Despite the difficulties , there are plenty of advantages and the number of people working from home is growing . Census data from 2010 shows that 9.5 percent of American workers work full- or part-time from home and the Bureau of Labor Statistics reports that around 25 percent of employed Americans work from home at least some hours each week . <p> We found that working from home is even more prevalent among our host families than the national average . In a recent poll of Cultural Care host families , 26% indicated that they or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said that at least one parent worked from home for a portion of the work week . Why do more parents with au pairs work from home ? Using au pair childcare makes working from home not only possible , but also highly productive by helping to overcome some of the challenges of working from home . <h> Creating a schedule <p> The first suggestion that experienced work-at-home parents offer , even though working from home provides a great deal of flexibility , is to establish a set schedule for the work day . This allows you to remain focused and on task and can start with setting your au pairs schedule . The flexibility of the au pair program permits you to create a schedule that allows for time differences in other countries or parts of the U.S. , busy times in the office and personal peak working hours . <p> And remember , an au pairs work hours do n't  have to correspond to when you are in your home office . You au pair can continue to help once your work day is over . One of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , my au pair is usually scheduled for another hour or two and she helps with baths and preparing lunches for the next day . " Another said , " I do have to go out in the evenings sometimes , so having the flexibility in her schedule is key to our choice for an au pair . " <h> Setting boundaries <p> Another major challenge of working from home is setting boundaries . This means establishing limitations for others children , neighbors , family as to when you are available and when you are working . An au pair can help with this and play the role of gatekeeper . One host mother commented on our work-from-home survey , " When I am working from home , the au pair is in charge and the kids know to go to her and not me . " <p> This can also mean setting boundaries for you , not allowing yourself to work too many hours . Although they can work a flexible schedule , au pairs are only allowed to work up to 10 hours per day . Host parents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during the au pairs working hours , so they can enjoy focused and attentive time with the kids when she is off duty . <h> Face time <p> Lack of " interactions and experiences " , or face time , is one of the reasons Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer is calling for a ban on working from home . Face time can be achieved in a number of ways through on-line meetings , in person meetings , and social interactions . Having an au pair allows you to have some virtual face time and get on teleconference calls without interruption . It also gives you the flexibility to go into the office for an important meeting , a touch-base with your manager or lunch with colleagues . <h> Distractions <p> Working from home , you may find yourself trying to fit " life maintenance " activities into the time that you should be working laundry , cooking , cleaning , and driving kids to activities or appointments . Having an au pair means that you can spend the day in your home office , knowing that the breakfast dishes will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the carpool responsibilities are taken care of and dinner is started . <h> Social isolation <p> According to AllBusiness , feeling isolated and alone can be one of the greatest challenges of working from home . You lose the chance to have connectivity in the office as well as having social interaction throughout the day . Not only can an au pair offer conversation when you take a break and check in with her , but having her there at home means you can go out and meet a friend for breakfast or attend a networking lunch . <h> Schools out for summer <p> Work at home parents without childcare look forward to the last day of school with anxiety . The productive serenity of their home from 8:00 to 2:30 will soon be filled with kids needing attention and rides to camps and activities . An au pair can keep them fully entertained all day throughout the summer months . <h> Unforeseen events <p> Sick child ? Your au pair can provide the extra attention your little one needs while you keep working . Last minute meeting at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Snow day ? You stay productive while your au pair builds snowmen and takes the kids sledding . Your house loses power or internet ? Bringing your laptop to Starbucks to do your work may not be ideal , but it would be impossible with a toddler in tow . <p> Your children may have been a factor in your decision to work from home , but that does n't  necessarily make juggling work and kids any easier . There are unique challenges associated with working from home and , for many parents , having au pair makes work , and life , a whole lot easier .

There are so many different ways to fulfill the education requirement , and our au pairs are experts in making the most of this opportunity . Read more about the kinds of classes au pairs are taking , what schools they have attended and what their advice is for other au pairs ! <p> Julia , au pair from Germany , took a class at the Borough of Manhattan Community College . She had a lot of fun and even traveled to Niagara Falls as a part of her studies . " It was stunning , and I was so happy to experience in person all that we talked about in class .

If they are not interested in taking full-semester classes ( which I encourage them to do , its a great way to meet people and keep busy ) , travel courses are a great way to travel and are very cheap . They are usually 3 credits so you can be done with two travel courses ! <p> Valentina , au pair from Italy , saved some of her own money to attend a class she was really interested in . <p> Valentina Massini , au pair from ItalySchool:Massbay Community College in Wellesley , MassachusettsClass : Journey through North America <p> Class highlights : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 6 Saturdays , and then I could choose from two trips ( my choices were Montreal , Quebec , Philadelphia , DC , Niagara Falls ) <p> Advice to other au pairs : This class was kind of expensive ( my family paid for 500 USD and I contributed an additional 400 USD ! ) So , if you love to travel and want to do a class like this , you should save some of your own money . <p> Thai au pair Pornsawan attended Northern Virginia Community College to take English classes .

Also , be sure to start researching classes well in advance so you can find something you are interested in and that works with your host familys schedule .

" Thank you so much ! I am so excited , " she said of the news . Leonie received a travel voucher and GoPro camera to help make the most of her travel time here in the U.S. The greatest gift she says , however , " is the chance to spend more time in the U.S. with my host family " Leonie and the Thompson family agreed to extend their time together for another 9 months just recently .

He had just spent much of the last year in training for the Coast Guard and would be leaving in June of 2014 for his first overseas mission . Their final match German au pair Leonie Hesse agreed to join their family and take on the responsibility of caring for the three Thompson children knowing Stephen would be away and Amy worked full-time . <p> Just 10 days before Leonie was scheduled to travel to the U.S. , Amy was diagnosed with breast cancer .

" <p> Leonie was shocked to hear about her diagnosis but appreciated Amys openness about the situation . " She shared so much very personal information with me . It made me realize how much she still wanted me to come . " Leonie talked it over with her mom a nurse who was very supportive of her decision either way . " I 've never known anyone with cancer so I did n't  know what to expect . But I decided I would go anyway . " Amy admits , " When Leonie called me back to say , Do n't  worry my bags are packed . I 'm still coming , I just cried . " <p> In her nomination , Amy shared : <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extended family members were not around and provided moral support for me and the children . She found ways to entertain and support the kids when I was not feeling my best . But most importantly , she ensured nothing changed in our kids routines . They have made every one of their soccer games , music lessons , concerts , and riding lessons . Leonie ensured their homework was done every night and helped them to study for exams . In fact , their grades have never been better . She is a pillar of strength and determination with a maturity that no one expected from an 18-year-old au pair . And she has managed all of this with an amazingly cheerful attitude . <p> We would have nominated her to be Au Pair of the Year because of her kindness , dedication and patience ; but she filled a bigger role than just an au pair .

And she 's admired how Amy has handled the cancer diagnosis and treatment . " Amy is so open about everything . She explains all of the treatments to her kids so they 're not scared . She had fun showing them her wig once she lost her hair . She keeps everything normal . " <p> The Thompson family is , of course , keeping their fingers crossed that Leonie decides to extend her year with them this summer . But Amy understands if she decides to go home , too . " We could not have asked for a better person , friend , and now family member to help us make it through this difficult year . "

Alexs host dad , Ed Urbaniak , submitted a nomination that left our many readers here in the Cultural Care Au Pair office in tears . We congratulate Alex for a job well done and invite you to read Eds letter . <p> In February , after several years counting on au pairs for our child care , it was time for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was dealing with some challenges . So , I made sure to take extra care with our selection . Our sons are adopted . Our older son ( Leon ) has a learning disability . Our younger son ( Ilo ) would be starting kindergarten .

With a spouse ill with cancer , I knew how important it was to have a reliable au pair that could be flexible in with our changing needs . <p> When we were introduced to Alex , he had finished a year with another family and was staying with his local coordinator in San Francisco . His previous family and the coordinator recommended him highly , but there is always concern when selecting a new au pair .

He has also pitched in to help in areas that I do n't  consider the duties of an au pair . He took my kids to my Mothers house to give me a much-needed respite from my new duties as single parent .

@@41904148 @1904148/ <h> Au pairs from Argentina react to news of Pope Francis <p> March 15 , 2013 <p> The historic announcement of the election of Pope Francis has the whole world talking . One aspect of cultural exchange programs , like the au pair program , is that it makes the world a little smaller as we get to know people from other countries and learn about their cultures and opinions . We have many au pairs from Argentina here in the U.S. and soon to be coming to American families . We asked some of them about their reaction and thoughts on the first pope from their country . <p> What was your reaction when you heard the news ? <p> Were very exited about the news , it really brings hope here . Bergolio is a strong figure , easily liked , so we all jumped in joy when we heard " habemus papam " followed by the word " Bergolio " . <p> Sofia Jakubowicz from Pilar , Argentina <p> Au pair in Minnesota <p> Well let me tell you that I heard the news by parts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from school one of the children that I take care . Before I went to the school I heard that a new pope was been elected , and as a Catholic I was very happy , when I got back to the house , the grandfather of the children came to me with the news that the new pope was from Argentina . The news shocked me a little , because , I never thought that " a person from the bottom of the world " ( as it is said in Argentinean newspapers ) could be a pope . <p> What was the reaction at home in your family , your town , your church ? <p> My dad was more than proud and all my family and friends are very hopeful about this . All the churches were ringing the bells and some places also turned their sirens on . They said it was all very moving to see the people celebrating on the streets . <p> Maria Mercedes Ossola , from Salta , Argentina <p> Au pair in Seattle , WA <p> I am so excited about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so I can feel the power of this news . When I heard the news I almost cried ! People are very happy here . They write on social webs about how they feel and post photos of Bergoglio . A girl told me she was on the bus and people started to shout and cry ! Of course there are some people who do n't  like this news but a huge percentage is very excited . It is very important for us to have an Argentinean pope , we are having a difficult political and social time and this is a very good news . <p> An Argentinean Pope , big words this mean a lot for Argentina and more in this time that things in Argentina are tough . I am happy that now Argentina can show to the world another side , and the world can see something good , not only the bad things , like the corruption for which is known Argentina . <p> Maria E. Spasiuk <p> At least for me and my friends , this is meaningless , I 'm not into religion . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brazil , Chile or some other countries in South America who are really involved with Catholicismyou know that we are the first country in South America who made same sex marriage possible . Also , many people who knows about history , will know that the role of the church during the military government between 1976 and 1983 , was n't nice . <p> Andrea from Ushuaia , Tierra del Fuego , Argentina <p> Au pair in California <p> I am in the training school in NY , but I contacted my family and they told me that when Bergoglio was elected everybody go out of their houses and prayed for him . Pope Bergoglio is very simple , humble , always helped the poor . Spanish is the first language of the church in the number of the faithful . For the Americas it is important , since we are one of the most important Catholic communities in the world . <p> Valeria Atn from San Juan , Argentina <p> Au pair in California <p> What is it like being away from home when there is such big news for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in such a historical moment . I wish I could have been there and celebrate this moment as its very important for us .

Also here I attend mass and its in Spanish so for sure the priest will talk about this massive event . I go every Sunday with a friend . Were happy because the church its very close from our home and the mass is in Spanish so we can join with other Latin people . <p> Maria B Diaz Regis from Buenos Aires , Argentina <p> Au pair in Maryland <p> I must say that I was divided , for two reasons , one I wanted to be at home celebrating with my family , but for the other side I am here , in the USA having a great experience .

@@41904151 @1904151/ <h> 7 tips for creating a great host family profile <p> August 5 , 2014 <p> When we asked our au pairs on Facebook : " What do you look for in a host familys profile while matching ? " they had lots to say . Some au pairs answered the question generally while some looked for more specific pieces of information . Either way , what you do ( and do n't  ) include in your host family profile will definitely impact whether or not your ideal candidate accepts an invitation to join your family . This is especially true now that au pairs have the opportunity to release host family matches on their own . While you want to " sell " your family to an extentby pointing out what an au pair will love about your family and communityits also in your best interest to paint a realistic picture of what an au pair can expect once she arrives . The following are some tips for creating a profile that will help you attract an au pair that is right for you . <p> 1 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a common thread in au pairs response to our question about what they look for in a host familys profile it was that they appreciate an application that is complete . As one Brazilian au pair in the matching process commented , " We are required to answer all questions in our application and host families often do not fill out even half . " More off-putting than the lack of information is the fact that an incomplete profile indicates that a family does not care enough to take the process seriously . A thorough and sincere profile suggests a family cares about who their au pair is and about her happiness during her year in the U.S. <p> 2 . Be truthful We demand that au pairs be absolutely truthful in their applications and host families should commit to doing the same . Although it might be tempting to glamorize your situation to attract more au pair candidates , its not a good practice in the end . So , as Marfa , an au pair from Mexico , recommends , " Just tell the truth . " If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , house size , lack of au pair car or weekly schedule , better to have her reject your family outright so you can find a candidate whose expectations and values are more in tune with your own . <p> 3 . Upload lots of photos Au pairs want to see photos of your children , of course . But they also want to see photos of their potential future host parents ( that 's you ) , your pets , your home and the au pairs bedroom . Photos that express your personality as a family are great to include . For example , if you are a really sporty family , consider including photos of your annual ski trip or a local bike ride . If you are a goofy family , show your sense of humor through a funny photo of yourselves . The more you can " show " a potential au pair what it will be like to live with your family , the better . <p> 4 . Write a thoughtful letter Your letter is the only section of your profile in which you get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so take full advantage of this opportunity . Describe each family members personality and likes and dislikes as well as why you want to welcome an au pair into your home . Au pairs love to hear about their host parents interests , careers and backgrounds in addition to information about the children so be sure to include details about you and your spouse as well . This is a good place to talk about how you see your au pair fitting into your life ( ie , do you want an au pair who is really going to become a member of the family or do you prefer someone who is a little more independent ? ) <p> 5 . Share some perks you can offer an au pair Offering loads of materialistic benefits upfront ( i.e. , unlimited use of a fancy car , an au pair suite with private entrance and bath , expensive vacations with the family ) can backfire on families who may find that au pairs are drawn to them for the wrong reasons . But pointing out a few unique benefits au pairs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do . For example , if your au pair will not have access to a car off-duty , you can try to offset that perceived disadvantage by disclosing the fact that there are at least a dozen other au pairs in your neighborhood who are potential friends and carpoolers . If you have a beautiful pool in the backyard that you love to use , let her know she 's welcome to use it , too . <p> 6 . Talk up your community Families often get frustrated by au pairs who only seem to want to match with families in southern CA or New York City . But those who take the time to point out all of the great things about their own community find that au pairs are easily swayed to travel elsewhere for the right family in another great location . Use the " Community " section of your profile as well as your letter to let au pairs know what they will appreciate about your area . <p> 7 . Include your familys schedule There is an opportunity in the profile to include your familys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fill this out in terms that are specific as possible . This is especially important if you require your au pair to work more unusual hours such as early mornings , evenings and weekends . Of course , its okay if your needs change somewhat once she arrives but its best to let candidates know what coverage you anticipate needing upfront because some au pairs are more particular about their on-duty schedule . <p> Families , how do you make sure your profile attracts the types of au pairs you are looking for ? What information do you make sure to include ?

" What I did n't  realize about Brazil , " Sharon shares , " is that wedding dresses are over-the-top expensive . And women do n't  always even buy wedding dresses ; they rent them .

So I asked my momwho has only been out of the country twiceto come with me . Initially she said no , but her mom called back the next day and said , I 'm 84 years old . How can I say no ?

But the fact is , an au pair is a lot different from a nanny for many reasons , even if you are considering a live in nanny . In this article , we will explore the differences between an au pair vs. a live in nanny . <p> Live in nannies A nanny can be used to describe any individualwhether professionally trained or notwho cares for children . Professional nannies make a career out of minding kids while other nannies do it for a short while in between school semesters or other jobs . You can hire a live in nanny or a live out nanny depending on whether you want the nanny to live in your home or not . Based on a 2012 salary and benefits survey distributed by the International Nanny Association , nannies salaries average about $705 per week , so in most cases nannies are more expensive than au pairs . With a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room and board , you may pay slightly less than what you would pay a live out nanny . The same survey showed the national average live in nanny cost as $652 per week . However , live in nannies may be more difficult to find , and you may end up paying more for a high quality live in nanny . <p> Unlike au pairs , nannies are often American . If your nanny is not a U.S. citizen , it is your responsibility to ensure she resides and can work legally in the U.S. Also unlike au pairs , nannies are not limited to work a certain number of hours , nor are they limited in what household help they provide . These are all factors you can negotiate on an individual bases . <p> What is an au pair ?

Au pairs can help with household duties related to the childrentheir laundry , food preparation and room pick-upbut can not be asked to provide the same chores for the whole family . Per U.S. State Department guidelines , all au pairs make the same weekly stipend of $195.75 . Families will also pay a program fee to their au pair agency .

Having a live-in nanny or au pair means another person under your roof , caring for your children . In a recent Cultural Care Au Pair poll , we asked host parents if they , or their spouse , had any concerns about having an au pair live in their home and how they overcame these concerns . <p> 1 . The concern : Loss of privacy <p> A recurring theme in the poll answers from host parents was loss of privacy . It is a reality for any type of live-in care . Parents found several ways to overcome this concern . <p> How they overcame it : <p> " We made sure we have an au pair who enjoys being out with other au pairs , seeing the U.S. " <p> " We got over it by just deciding having an au pair had more pros than cons . " <p> " All of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been a problem . " <p> " Gradually , you just get used to it . And find time for date nights . " <p> " We were pleasantly surprised how much our au pair likes to go out on weekends with other au pairs so we get more alone time than we thought ! We love our au pair but it is nice to have family alone time , too . " <p> 2 . The concern : Another person in the house <p> " Just having another body around taking showers using the bathroom , and taking up one of our bedrooms was a concern . " <p> How they overcame it : <p> " The assistance our au pair provides with the dishes and childrens laundry and running errands has certainly made up for any inconvenience . " <p> And from another host parent , " We were worried about having someone else in our house all the time , eating meals with us and sitting with us during down time . However , the moment our first au pair joined us we realized it was like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our meals , down times , and other times even better . " <p> 3 . The concern : Having the au pair feel like a guest <p> " Our concern was just getting past the guest phase to having the au pair feel like another family member . " <p> How they overcame it : <p> " We just decide to act ourselves from the first day to get everyone used to a routine . " Another parent shared , " It can feel weird to have a stranger in your house , but as long as you treat them as a family member , such as a niece or daughter it works . " <p> 4 . The concern : Internet use , guests , car use <p> " We had general concerns about the au pair not being focused on the kids because she is texting or on the internet , not knowing what is safe and what is not safe , not knowing how to react in an emergency , bringing strangers to the house , posting private information on Facebook , drinking and driving , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> How they overcame it : <p> " We have very clear rules about car usage , internet usage and bringing people to the house and well as other things involving the kids safety . The au pair rules are written out and shared with the au pair upon arrival . We always address it immediately if any of the rules are not being followed . " <p> 5 . The concern : Having another woman in the house <p> " I was concerned that I would be uncomfortable about the interaction between my husband and a young beautiful foreign woman . " <p> How they overcame it : <p> It has worked out all right for all the years we 've hosted au pairs I mostly manage them day to day , and there is always the right tone and appropriate balance in their relationship with my husband . <p> 6 . The concern : Not having actually met <p> " We were concerned about having a foreign person who we never met before live with us and care for our children . " <p> How they overcame it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and au pair selection processes were and spoke to our LCC , we felt more confident . The ability to interview prospective au pairs via Skype was also very helpful , and made us comfortable with our decision . " <p> 7 . The concern : Following your rules <p> " We had concerns about the au pair following our wishes with the children when we are not home . " <p> How they overcame it : <p> " We daily review the plans and the expectations because times can change with moods . Also , there are many temptations for all of us , internet , down time , shortcuts , TVall those things that have to be assessed and how they affect the function of the family .

The legend of the poinsettia states that as a little girl was walking to church to see the Nativity she realized she had no gift to bring the Christ child so she gathered up some plain green branches .

@@41904166 @1904166/ <h> 8 tips for helping your au pair or nanny take more initiative <p> July 9 , 2014 <p> This posts advice comes from Julie Dye , a local childcare consultant ( LCC ) and host mom in Boulder , Colorado . As a former exchange student and active traveler , Julie is super passionate about the cultural exchange experience and has enjoyed opening her familys home and lives to 6 au pairs , the last of whom arrived from Switzerland this past January . Julie is well-known and respected for her sage advice in the Cultural Care community , and was happy to share her thoughts on what host families can do if they would like their au pairs to be taking more initiative when on-duty . <p> When I speak with host families , one frustration I sometimes hear is that their au pair does not take initiative . Sometimes even when host parents have repeatedly given their au pair the feedback " We want you to take initiative " they feel their au pair has not made any changes . As I see in nearly every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the outcome . The following are some things families can do to help their au pairs be successful at taking more initiative . <p> 1 . Communicate exactly what " taking the initiative " means and give specific examplesExplain to your au pair that taking initiative means to take action without being asked . Be specific : " By initiative we mean that instead of us asking you to bring out the art supplies and do crafts with the kids this morning , you would think of those projects yourself and do them without us having to tell you . " Clarify that initiative can show not only in how she interacts with your children , but also what she does around the house with child-related tasks . You might not have asked her to organize the bookshelf , but explain how much you appreciate it when she recognizes it needs to be done and does it on her own . Remember that no au pair , no matter how great she is , can read your mind . Recognize the difference between what you want and what you 're communicating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ask for it . <p> 2 . Ask your au pair what initiative she thinks she is already taking Find out what your au pair thinks she is doing that is above and beyond what you ask of her . In many cases , the au pair is doing tasks that you have not noticed . ( If this is true , make sure to acknowledge her efforts . ) If she ca n't think of any examples of taking initiative , it will help her realize there is room for improvement . <p> 3 . Understand the cultural differences the affect initiative Its common in many cultures for an employee to fear criticism from an employer for making a mistake , so rather than take initiative and do something wrong , an au pair might stick to what host parents have told her to do . For example , in parts of the world , it can be considered extremely rude for a younger woman in a household to cook without being askedthough most of us would LOVE if our au pairs took that initiative , would n't we ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with your au pair about what is normal in her family and country . <p> 4 . Role model your valuesand ask the au pair to do the sameThe best leaders do n't  just give orders , they inspireand you can do the same to help your au pair take more initiative . For example , after a meal , you can show your au pair how easy and helpful it is to not only clean up your own dishes , but also help with general dinner clean up . As you are getting the children ready in the morning or for bed show her how taking a couple of minutes to pick up pajamas or clothes before you go helps save time later on . I recommend having your au pair shadow you as you do some of these tasks yourself and talk through your logic out loud . It also helps if you enlist your au pair to serve as a role model for the children " Please clean up after each activity with the children because we want them to understand what they should do . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pairs who feel more comfortable with structure , try setting up a calendar to encourage initiative-taking . For example , each Monday your au pair can search Pinterest for a craft to do with the kids ; on Tuesdays she can clean or organize a different spot in the childrens room or play area ; on Wednesdays , ask her to take the kids on different walk through the neighborhood ; on Thursdays , she can try preparing a different food for the children to try ; and every Friday ask your au pair to teach your kids a new word in her language . <p> 6 . Let your au pair make mistakes Try to look at mistakes as learning opportunities . When your au pairs know that mistakes wo n't lead to retribution , but are instead viewed as a basis for learning for everyone , she will be more willing to take initiative and offer additional suggestions and ideas . <p> 7 . Provide clear and continued feedbackGetting your au pair to take more initiative will require meaningful feedback . Sometimes I have seen host parents try to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feedback , the au pair will walk away feeling praise . Its important to offer feedback , support and encouragement on an ongoing basis , recognizing both your au pairs strengths and the opportunities for improvement . <p> 8 . Keep your expectations realistic Being an au pair is often a very busy and demanding job . Most host parents realize the level of engagement caring for children requires , but sometimes we ask more of our au pairs than even we are capable . When I occasionally come home to a messy house , I have to remind myself that I also have trouble keeping the house clean when watching the kids all day and I should n't expect more of my au pair than I can do . Many au pairs , especially those who work close to the 45 hour a week maximum , find it very difficult to go above and beyond when the expectations for what they do on duty are already very high . I 've heard from host families that their au pair " does exactly what is asked of her ; nothing more . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this can also be a sign of a great au pair ! It means that she is listening to you and following your rules . <p> Host families , do you have any other advice for parents struggling with this issue ? What has worked for you in the past ? We look forward to hearing any additional feedback . 
@@41904167 @1904167/ <h> Au pairs and household help : what and how much is ok ? <p> March 31 , 2014 <p> One great part about the au pair program is that au pairs can help with household duties related to the kids , and as any busy parent knows , even a little bit of help goes a long way . Returning home to a ( relatively ) clean and organized household at the end of the day is hugely satisfying . It also allows you to spend more quality time with your children because you 're not worrying about what to feed them for dinner or trying to get in a load of their laundry before bedtime . <p> Cultural Care Au Pair defines " household duties related to the children " as doing the kids laundry , helping to keep their rooms tidy and preparing their meals . The U.S. Department of State agrees : " While the primary responsibility of the au pair is to care for the children , au pairs can perform some household duties that are child related ( meal preparation , light housekeeping , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you ask your au pair for help with household chores , she must complete them within the 45-hour per week and 10-hour per day work limit . <p> While most families and au pairs figure out a successful balance of childcare and household help on their own , sometimes the lack of specifics leaves parents confused as to what is and what is n't acceptable to ask of an au pair . To get a better idea of how our families interpret the rules on household duties , we polled families on the subject . About 2/3 of host families ask their au pair to perform 1-4 hours of light housekeeping per week while 24% of families require 5-9 hours of household help . 5% of host families ask au pairs to dedicate 10+ hours to household chores while an additional 5% do n't  ask for any household help at all . <p> We asked what kinds of chores au pairs were doing and the responses included : <p> Kids dishes and meals <p> Childrens laundry <p> Running kid-errands like returning their books to the library <p> Preparing the childrens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up after kids <p> Cleaning out the back seat of car about 1x a month <p> Making kids beds and changing their sheets <p> Picking up/organizing toys <p> All things everyone does in our house <p> The results of our informal poll show that most families and au pairs are doing it right when it comes to household chores . The majority of families ask for a reasonable 1-9 hours of help related to the kids and all of the duties listed above are reasonable expectations . <p> If you still wonder if you 're asking too much of your au pair , run the situation by your LCC or program director . They can provide perspective on your to-do list . If you feel your household requests are within the boundaries of the program but your au pair has trouble fulfilling them , aupairmom.com has some great tips for families in this position which include : <p> Provide the au pair with an explicit list of the chores for her children <p> Teach the au pair how to do each of these chores <p> Add these chores to the list @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ au pair a few strategies for mingling interaction with the kids and working on these tasks <p> Discuss with the au pair that this work needs to be done , if the au pair fails to get it done <p> In the end , families should be able to rely on au pairs for household help related to the kids as its one very attractive benefit to the program .

@@41904190 @1904190/ <h> Why host an au pair from Germany ? <p> May 22 , 2013 <p> Why host a Cultural Care au pair from Germany ? <p> The next country in our series of spotlights on Cultural Cares au pair recruitment countries is Germany ! Again , while we always recommend that families be open to hosting the best au pair for their needsregardless of her nationalityit can be helpful to learn about how an au pairs home country can affect her personality and skill sets . Marc Jacshinski , Cultural Cares Recruitment Director for Germany ( pictured below ) , shares why he thinks families should consider an au pair from Germany . <p> GENERAL CHARACTERISTICSGerman au pairs are great because They are very mature and reliable . Germans learn early to stand on their own feet , especially when it comes to fulfilling household duties . They are responsible caretakers with a lot of childcare experience , and also are strong drivers . German au pairs are very open to other cultures and look forward to the opportunity to travel abroad . <p> Cultural differences that are positive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take on household responsibilities and duties . Also , they are independent and mature and have a " get the job done-approach " . Germans tend to perform well in structured and efficient environments . Overall , they are usually well-behaved and have good manners . They appreciate to be seen as a " 3rd parent " and are willing to take on that responsibility . <p> Cultural differences that could prove challenging : <p> German communication is very direct in comparison to the American way of addressing things . Sometimes things come across much more blunt or forward , than we really mean them . <p> German au pairs like to be seen as 3rd parent and are willing to take on that responsibility . Since the German education focuses a lot on being independent and responsible , au pairs may struggle with being " treated like children " . Because Germans have a lot of freedom in terms of curfew times , travelling with friends , etc . German au pairs might find it difficult to adjust to early curfew and other restrictive family rules . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a surrounding that does n't  have a daily schedule , or in an environment with less structure . <p> In all these cases communication is key . If families expect au pairs to follow certain rules/procedures , it will be important to sit down and explain to the au pair why exactly it is important to do so and what exactly the expectations are the family has in reference to the au pairs job . In knowing these expectations in advance , German au pairs can adjust accordingly and adhere to the familys lifestyle and preferences . <p> ENGLISH LANGUAGE SKILLSHow do au pairs from Germany typically learn English , and what are their strengths and weaknesses regarding written and oral mastery of the language ? In Germany every student starts to learn English as one of two mandatory foreign languages at the age of ten , the very latest . In general the standard of English is pretty high , but due to the lack of oral practice and listening comprehension ( movies and TV series are all dubbed in German ) usually the au pairs have small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That being one of the main reasons to spend a year in the U.S. most au pairs pick up quickly and get quite fluent after the first weeks , though . <p> DRIVING SKILLSTypically au pairs start driving around age : 17 <p> Au pairs in your country can obtain a drivers license at the age of : 18 <p> What are the steps involved in obtaining a drivers license ? The process to receive a drivers license is extensive and consists of : <p> A theoretical test with 30 questions randomly picked from a catalog of almost 1,000 total questions . <p> 28 hours of compulsory training for the theoretical part <p> At least 5 weeks of practical training including an average of 20 hours with general practice in addition to 12 hours of special training including driving on highways , autobahn and at nights finalized by a 45 minutes practical test . <p> What types of vehicles and in what conditions do au pairs from Germany have experience driving ? Most families in Germany have at least two cars and many au pairs even buy their own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Germany they are experienced in driving under rainy/icy conditions . <p> Typically , au pairs from Germany have experience:Driving smaller vehicles , driving in the snow , Driving on highways , driving on country roads , driving alone , driving with children <p> Typically , au pairs from Germany do not have much experience:Driving larger vehicles <p> CHILDCARE EXPERIENCEAu pairs from Germany typically get their childcare experience by:Babysitting younger siblings , babysitting extended family members , babysitting children of family friends/neighbors , working in a kindergarten , working in a daycare center , coaching childrens sports teams , working as a camp counselor , or tutoring . <p> EDUCATIONIn Germany , school from the age of 6-15 is required . Students can either attend public or private school . The educational system is divided into three broad levels : primary , secondary and tertiary . Primary and secondary are common throughout the country . Tertiary can consist of technical and further education or university . There are two semesters per academic year , the first starting beginning of October and the second starting in spring . Most young people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gap year after finishing high school , and before they proceed in further education or in finding their first job.FAMILY LIFEThe average German family has 2 children . After leaving school at the age of 18 or 19 , they oftentimes leave their parents for study , apprenticeship or work , so most of our au pairs have not had any experience of living away from parents when they apply to the program . In most families both parents have a job and therefore family time is very limited , but even so much valued . Au pairs are expected to cook for themselves and take on household responsibilities at an early age and are used to contributing to keeping up the household and family routines . <p> DIETThe diet in Germany varies . Some au pairs may be considered vegetarians , though they certainly are comfortable and willing to prepare meat . <p> COMMUNICATIONThe majority of German au pairs have daily use of a computer and have their own cell phone .

Cultural Care Au Pair host parents , Becky and Nick Manicone , recently appeared on CNN and dispelled that myth , explaining that their au pair costs less than other forms of childcare where they live in Virginia . <p> Childcare costs on the rise <p> Its true that childcare costs are soaring . A recent report from ChildCare Aware of America shows that many families are spending more money on childcare than they do on their mortgages . It also shows that the annual cost of childcare in many areas exceeds the cost of college tuition . <p> The sharp increase in the cost of traditional day care centers and nannies is pushing families like the Manicones to consider alternative childcare options . While some families are lucky enough to have family nearby who can help out with the kids , many families have to look for full time childcare so that both parents can work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Manicones were shocked to find that hiring a nanny in their area would cost around $50,000 a year . With nanny costs that high , some families decide that its more cost effective for one parent to stay home with the kids . When they compared the cost of a nanny to the cost of an au pair , they found they would save thousands of dollars , and have more flexible coverage when it comes to setting their au pairs schedule . <p> Au pair cost vs. daycare cost <p> The cost and quality of day care centers varies greatly from place to place , but in Virginia the study showed the average annual cost of having one infant and one 4-year-old child in a day care center was $18,966 . Beyond the high cost of day care , the Manicones also found long waiting lists that basically made it impossible for them to enroll their children . <p> The verdict on au pair cost <p> So how much does an au pair cost ? The average total au pair cost comes to $360 per week for 45 hours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Check out the current au pair cost breakdown from Cultural Care Au Pair . <p> But according to Becky Manicone , more important than the au pair cost is the quality of childcare you get and the relationships you build with your au pairs : <p> " We love our au pairs ! Each one plays a special role in our family . We stay in contact with them after they leave and have even visited them in their home countries . One of our au pairs included our daughters in her wedding in Colombia . Our family was thrilled to visit her country , participate in her wedding and meet her extended family . I cant imagine using any other type of child arrangement for our family . Our au pairs have enriched our lives and give us peace of mind knowing that our children are well cared for and loved , with the added bonus of our children being able to spend their after school hours at home .

Also , as Cuong and Ebba are our best downhill skiers , they share lots of fun moments on the slopes during the winter . <p> Ebba has traveled with her host family within the U.S. and also overseas during her two years with them . <p> Our family has benefited greatly from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from food eaten in Sweden versus the USA , France , Israel , etc. to how the politics of Syrian/Mideast refugees are playing out differently in Sweden , the USA and elsewhere and how these events will impact generations to come . All of our perspectives have expanded due to the insights that Ebba shares . Ebba has experienced our holidays , prepared traditional American dishes , learned U.S. geography , visited American museums , and experienced our elections . Ebba has travelled extensively ( both with our family and friends ) to Canada , France , Israel , Hungary , Austria , Pennsylvania , New York , Florida , California , Louisiana , Massachusetts , North Carolina , Washington , DC , Florida and soon to West Virginia and Hawaii . Together we would always explore the history , food , art , and local customs of each place . <p> In Ebba , Stephanie and Benjamin have found a true friend . <p> In addition to helping our family expand our perspectives , Ebba has used the opportunity with us to expand her own horizons in so many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ highest grades college courses in sociology , interpersonal communications and photography . Especially in her coursework , she demonstrated true initiative and perseverance . For example , when initially denied access to the course she wanted due to space constraints , Ebba approached the director of the program and gave him every reason to physically create a space for her in the course . She successfully convinced him . Ebba has become a model advocate for us all . <p> We have watched Ebba evolve over her time with us . She first came with dreams of being a member of an American family , learning something about the American way of life and culture , enhancing her horizons , and improving her English . She has realized all these dreams and much more . It is with great sadness that we parted with Ebba at the end of January 2016 , but we know that Ebba will return to Sweden as a confident woman who will carve her path with grace and focus . She will undoubtedly help make the world a better place , likely avoiding and reducing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her return will be difficult for us , we will always view Ebbas stay with us as an incredible growing experience for us all and a priceless treasure to be valued forever . We will pore over our thousands of photos and tell countless stories for years to come ! And of course , we look forward to the day that we can visit Ebba in Sweden and see the country that helped create the lovely person who came to us one January day . Thank you , Cultural Care , for giving us the most wonderful gift : time to know Ebba Charlotta Hakansdotter Larsson . <p> Thank you to Lori Rickles for sharing this wonderful story and for nominating Ebba for the prestigious honor of Au Pair of the Year . Stay tuned for more nomination stories in the coming weeks and months !

Young people abroad are lured to the au pair program with promises of parties , boys and lots of travel . <p> August 15 , 2012 <p> There 's a myth out there that au pair agencies promise their applicants a fairytale world full of parties on the beach , boys galore and travel to all the American hotspots as soon as they arrive to the U.S. This belief , in fact , could not be further from the truth . <p> First of all , in many of our au pair recruitment countries , the idea of becoming an au pair is very well-known and young people have most likely heard about the experience from friends who have done it before . In Sweden and Germany , for example , au pairing has been going on for decades , so those who apply will at least have an idea of what to expect . Ida Hargsj , Country Manager for Cultural Care Au Pair in Sweden says , " In Sweden its pretty straightforward that its a serious job caring for children .

" He adds , " I can only tell you from our side that we are very distinct about the fact that our candidates apply for a childcare job throughout the whole application process . " <p> For countries in which becoming an au pair is a bit more novel , educating applicants about the au pair program starts as early as the first phone call . " In the Mexican office , we tell applicants that this is a hard job for the first time by phone when they are just asking for information .

Many former au pairs post their stories and emphasize very clearly the tough part of the program . " <p> Regardless of how much a candidate knows about the program before she applies or where she is from Cultural Care Au Pair has a rigorous and standardized au pair screening process . This process includes multiple steps along the way that give overseas staff an opportunity to share with au pair candidates what to expect during a year with an American host family . <p> And to ensure the highest level of communication and standardization , Cultural Care Au Pairs recruitment process is the only agency designated by the U.S. Department of State to recruit all of our au pairs through staff in our own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This means we have full control and complete transparency into the screening and preparation process in every recruitment country . <p> In every country , an au pair applicant attends a Screening &amp; Orientation ( S&amp;O ) meeting and undergoes a one-on-one interview and English evaluation . During most of the S&amp;O meetings , former au pairs speak about their own personal experiences . " Our former au pairs point out that it can be tough having kids around you the whole day and being the one responsible and this is a major part of the year ! " writes Kajta Richter , Country Manager in Austria . " During personal interviews I think it is something that also passes through in our general speech . We use the terms job and responsibility a lot for instance , " says Elise Fin , Country Manager in France . <p> Our print material is also tightly controlled and structuredwe know exactly what our literature is saying ( with words and pictures ) to our audiences in every part of the world .

She says that , " A lot of the time it is because of the length of time , missing family and friendsor that it looked like too much work . " Helping applicants self-select out of the au pair program is an important part of the process . <p> Even though its easy to tell au pair hopefuls about all the responsibilities they face , " Helping them realize how tough it is in reality is another thing , of course , " admits Elise Fin .

Lhee Wanaleesukson , Cultural Cares Country Program Manager for Thailand ( pictured below ) , shares why she thinks families should consider an au pair from Thailand . <p> GENERAL CHARACTERISTICSThai au pairs are great becauseThey are mature , generous , and open-minded . They likely have completed their degrees , and even have some work experiences . They will thrive if they can take part in your family activities . <p> Top 3 reasons Thai want to become au pairs : <p> To better their English <p> To travel the U.S. <p> To better their job prospects when returning home <p> Cultural differences that are positive : <p> Thais are warm , friendly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that truly want to integrate an au pair into their family and home life .

Keep in mind that they seem shy or might hesitate to tell you if something is bothering them so you may need to probe a bit if you suspect that your au pair is homesick or if they need help resolving an issue . <p> Also , in Thailand , it is uncommon to " help yourself " to food and therefore Thai au pairs may need some time to adjust to American ways of getting food without being offered it . <p> ENGLISH LANGUAGE SKILLSHow do au pairs from Thailand typically learn English , and what are their strengths @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? <p> Thai au pairs learn English starting in primary school . However , English is only the small part in the curriculum and it is normally taught by Thai teachers , who do not have skills like the native speaker . Most of the curriculum emphasizes on grammar . Many Thai children become experts in English grammar , have a big vocabulary , and are able to write in English well , but can not speak English fluently . Au pairs are typically university graduates and have a good basic command of English . As with all au pairs their spoken English improves quickly during the first few weeks in the U.S. <p> DRIVING SKILLS <p> What types of vehicles and in what conditions do au pairs from Thailand have experience driving ? Normally Thai au pairs borrow their parents car but if they live in Bangkok , they do n't  need to drive because of the vast public transportation and also the amount of traffic . <p> Typically , au pairs from Thailand have experience:Driving smaller vehicles , driving on highways , driving in the rain , driving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Typically , au pairs from Thailand do not have much experience:Driving larger vehicles and driving in the snow <p> Babysitting younger siblings , babysitting extended family members , babysitting children of family friends/neighbors , working in a kindergarten , working in a daycare center or tutoring . <p> They usually have gained their childcare hours from working in a day care , and it is also very common for them to have experience taking care of the children under 2 years old . Also , Thais usually have large extended families so it is common that they will help to care for family members such as younger siblings , cousins , nieces and nephews . <p> EDUCATIONThey start to go to pre-school starting at 3-5 years old , and continue on to primary then secondary school .

Our curriculum includes child development , effective communication , behavior management , food and nutrition and , of course , safety and emergency education . Adding CPR and first aid instruction by Red Cross trainers is an excellent enhancement to our comprehensive training program . " <p> Many au pairs have already had similar training , but providing thorough instruction at the Au Pair Training School will ensure that all participants have completed the CPR certification program . Marc Jaschinski , Country Manager for Cultural Care in Germany says , " Although all German au pairs are required to take CPR in order to get their drivers license and therefore come to the U.S. with relevant training , the course at the Au Pair Training School will reinforce the basics of pediatric CPR and serve as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The American Red Cross has been the go-to source for more than a century for information , skills and confidence to act in an emergency .

The Red Cross is looking forward to providing this important training to young people from around the world before they start their year caring for American children . " <p> Our approach to this training is unique in that we are the only organization to provide au pairs training in a formal academic setting .

Qualified , recent training can provide the essential information as well as the confidence to take life saving actions . And , given that 88% of cardiac arrests occur at home , if an au pair is called on to administer CPR in an emergency , the life saved is most likely to be that of a child .

@@41904206 @1904206/ <h> 5 qualifications to look for in a childcare provider <p> May 8 , 2014 <p> When you are looking for quality childcare for your family , some things , like your childs safety , just are n't  negotiable . Unfortunately , different childcare providers offer a wide range of experience and qualifications , and regulations on childcare providers range from non-existent to poorly enforced . So , before you choose a childcare provider , whether its a nanny , an au pair or a daycare , read our list of must-have qualifications and be sure to do your homework on any candidate you consider <p> 1 . Previous experience caring for children <p> There 's nothing like hands-on experience caring for children to prepare someone for the realities of childcare . Whether a person has grown up babysitting for siblings , cousins and neighbors or worked in a professional daycare or school setting , the fact that they have spent time being responsible for the well-being of children the same ages as your kids is probably the most relevant item on their rTsumT . When it comes to au @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pairs are required to have a minimum of 200 hours of previous childcare experience , and many have much more than that . Additionally , for an au pair to be eligible to care for an infant under two years old , they must have had at least 200 hours of experience caring for children under age two . <p> When interviewing a nanny , au pair or even a daycare provider , ask lots of " behavioral interview " style questions . These kinds of questions help you to understand how a candidate has handled situations in the past , and their answers are the best way to gauge how they would handle these issues with your children . For example , " Tell me about a time when you were taking care of a child who was n't following your instructions . What did you do ? <p> 2 . Good references <p> Since your potential childcare provider will have previous experience caring for children , she or he will also have references who can give you another perspective on her strengths and potential pitfalls . If you are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for at least two references from other parents and be sure to call them . <p> If you are considering a Cultural Care au pair , all candidates will have submitted at least three non-relative references , and the references will have been called by someone from the Cultural Care office to verify the information and also to get the references impressions of the candidates . Families are also encouraged to reach out to the au pairs references themselves . <p> 3 . A criminal background check <p> Its a good idea to make sure that the person or people you entrust with your children have a clean criminal record . In the U.S. , be sure that you check your candidates in a national registry , not just a state one . Also , you will need to use a service that is FCRA ( Fair Credit Reporting Act ) compliant if you are doing a background check on a potential employee . If you are evaluating daycares , be sure that all employees of the daycare are subject to national criminal background checks . <p> Since au pairs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. registry . Check with the au pair agency to see what kind of screening they provide . Cultural Care Au Pair requires all au pair candidates to undergo a national criminal background check in their home country . <p> 4 . Pediatric and Adult CPR and First Aid certification <p> Hopefully , your childcare provider will never have to use these skills , but in the case of a medical emergency , you want the peace of mind that she will be prepared . Certifications can be earned through the American Red Cross , and are good for two years , though they also offer online refreshers to help keep skills and knowledge fresh . <p> If you are considering an au pair , Cultural Care includes American Red Cross Pediatric and Adult CPR and First Aid certification as part of the training that is provided to all au pairs the week before they arrive to their host family , so you can be sure their skills and knowledge are up-to-date and in the forefront of their minds . <p> 5 . Training on prevention of disease <p> If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spread and catch germs . Especially if you 're considering daycares , its a good idea to find out what policies are in place to reduce the chances that your kids will come home sick all the time . Proper hand washing , diapering , and food safety practices are among the basics , as well as understanding what kind of restrictions they place on sick children or caregivers . Nannies and au pairs should also have a good understanding of how to prevent illness , even though you can better control how much exposure your kids have to others . Cultural Care au pairs are given specific training on prevention of disease during their time at the Au Pair Training School before joining a family .

A host mom recently reached out to her local childcare consultant ( LCC ) for advice on how to ask their au pair for a little more privacy . She explained : " Overall we are very happy with our au pair . She has bonded with the kids and really become part of the family . We enjoy having her around and we think she likes us too . Maybe too much . We wanted to ask if its normal for an au pair to hang out with the family all the time . Most nights Jana* hangs out with us after we get home from work , which is totally fine , and were actually having a lot more family dinners now . We then take the kids up to bed and when we come down all three of us typically watch TV until we go to bed . Oftentimes , Jana is in the middle of couch with us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Her room has a TV , cable , Netflix , etc so we just wanted to know if this is normal . Again , we like her a lot and overall things are very good .

She talked with au pair about the fact that their family needed some down time by themselves and explained that their previous au pair did get out more and did more Skyping with family in her room . It worked , and the au pair wasnt offended at all . She thought she was supposed to hang out all the time with the host family . <p> Rebecca Cronin , LCC in PA I think the family has to very nicely talk to her about their expectations .

This au pair was not at all upset , told me she understood and backed off right away . <p> Host parents , have you ever had an au pair that acted a little too close for comfort ?

Since 1995 , the Ohl family has hosted 17 au pairs most from Germany or Austria , and one from Poland . Host mother , Katrina , explained that , just as she grew up bi-lingual , " We wanted our children to have the experience of cultural exchange as well as exposure to speaking German , and we needed flexible childcare " and for this , the au pair program was the perfect fit . <p> Kristina created a video with photos of her au pairs through the years to show at her familys au pair reunion last summer . <p> The reunion started off with a picnic and games in the English Garden Park , and then dinner that evening in the Spatenhaus Restaurant in the city center .

They all say that the au pair experience changed their lives . It made them more independent , self-confident and further strengthened their love of travel . They all agreed that it was n't easy work , but it was one of the best experiences they ever had . <p> The Ohl family was thrilled that so many of their former au pairs could join them for this reunion to be remembered . They shared , " We told them how grateful we were that we had their help and how each one of them , with their many different strengths and talents , had added something new and valuable to our childrens upbringing and our familys life . We view them all as extra daughters and part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contact with us and our children . " <p> And this was not the first reunion had by the Ohl family and their au pairs ! The first was in 2005 in Florida , where they celebrated 10 years of hosting au pairs and 7 of their former au pairs were able to join them . During this time , the family and au pairs alike , strengthened their bonds and reminisced of their time together . They all had so much fun during that reunion that the Ohl sisters insisted that they wanted to have another reunion when the family went to Austria this summer , hence the reunion in Munich , Germany . <p> The Ohl family has stayed in touch with their au pairs thanks to social platforms such as Skype and Facebook . Every time Kristina and Lianna post a photo , they get lots of " likes " and comments from their " big sister " au pairs . They love having older sisters that they can get advice from , stay in touch with and continue to visit for years to come .

@@41904237 @1904237/ <h> Fact or fiction ? Transition au pairs are just other host families ' rejects . <p> October 29 , 2012 <p> Before tackling this statement , let me first define transition au pairs for those readers who do n't  know what one is . A transition au pairor in-country au pair ( the terms are used interchangeably ) are au pairs who have matched and started their year with one host family but have to decided to part ways with the family and are currently looking for a new host family to join . <p> When families recognize that transition au pairs are part of Cultural Care Au Pairs pool of available candidates , they often assume that something must be wrong with them . " Why would we want another familys reject ? " is an oft-shared sentiment . What a lot of families do n't  realize is that sometimes transition au pairs can be great candidates to consider , depending on what they are looking for . <p> To understand why , I think its important to share that the reason most families and au pairs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ communication breakdown . " When a host family and au pair are n't  seeing eye-to-eye and do n't  take time to talk about their problems , the relationship can deteriorate pretty quickly , confirms Terry Bell , Cultural Care Au Pairs Director of In-Country Placement . " Most of the transitions that happen are because families and au pairs have given up on fixing their differences and want a fresh start . " <p> Says one anonymous blogger on a popular au pair site : " Some of our best au pairs have been au pairs who were rematches . Two in particular had come from families where there was a personality issue . We had one 2nd year au pair who was also good , but did not want to be a part of the familywe knew this going in and that had been part of the problem with the previous host family . She was on when with the kids , but she had a boyfriend and she wanted independence . We were fine with that . " <p> Jennifer Guarracino , host mom in Ohio actually prefers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ au pair , Ana from Colombia , came from a transition situation . In fact , all three of her subsequent au pairs have also been transition au pairs and all of themMaria from Sweden , Sarah from Austria and Stehfy from Colombiawere in transition due to communication issues and personality conflicts . Jenn says , " In my experience , au pairs are not going to make the same mistakes twice . The same goes for host families . Au pairs and families in transition know now what happens when you do n't  talk about things . Like any relationship , for it to work you have to put in an effort . You get out of it what you put into it . " <p> Two other common reasons transitions occur are due to driving and language abilities , and in a small number of cases , host families release their au pairs due to safety concerns . In all but the last circumstance , au pairs are allowed to re-join the matching pool if their family and/or LCC recommends them for placement ( au pairs who jeopardize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Host mom Jill Janson says of her transition au pair ( pictured above with their daughter ) , " Carolina had two transitions , the first of which happened because of her lack of driving experiencefor us that was actually perfect because we preferred not to have a driver or someone that wanted to drive . " She adds , " The second transition happened because the family was n't totally confident in Carolinas experience caring for two young children under the age of 3 years . I , however , have a totally different experience . She is excellent with my baby and I could n't have more confidence in her . It would have been a tragedy for Carolina to go home because she is incredible . " <p> While transition au pairs are clearly not " other host families rejects " , keep in mind that not every transition au pair will fit a familys needs . Terry Bell recommends that families carefully consider what they are looking for in a candidate and speak with as many of her references as possible before making a decision . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bring to the table . When I asked our two host from above to share some of the advantages of hosting in-country au pairs , they had a lot to say . <p> From Jill Janson : <p> References are easier and you can meet them in person . I loved being able to talk to Carolinas previous host families and LCCs for their perspectives . Because we were in the same time zones and speaking the same language I felt like I could dig deeper and understand more than if I were checking a reference from overseas . We did n't  meet Carolina in person because she was living in a different state but I know a lot of parents who make that a priority when interviewing transition au pairs . <p> They are available right away . In our case , we really wanted to have someone join our household right away . Hosting a transition au pair means the time between interviewing and when she shows up at your doorstep is unbelievably quick . <p> From Jennifer Guarracino : <p> Homesickness is n't an issue . For a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really want to continue her au pair experience . I have found what when our transition au pairs have arrived they are either over that stage of their journey or were the kind of au pairs that never really felt homesick to begin with . <p> Experience driving in the U.S. is a plus . All of our au pairs came with experience driving in the United States . While the road conditions and climate might be different , there is comfort knowing this person drove with another family , in the United States , with our gigantic vehicles on our busy streets . <p> There is little orientation or " ramp up " time . Since theyve already had experience with American family life and culture , transition au pairs do n't  need nearly as much time to adjust . In contrast to my first au pair who came straight from Mexico , our transition au pairs were easily able to jump right into the house , routine , schedule and life . <p> Gratefulness and humility go a long way .

I am still in touch with all of them and we are happy to have helped them re-write their story so it ends on a positive note . <p> To sum up the potential transition au pairs represent , I 'll quote another anonymous blogger from the same popular au pair website : " My BEST three au pairs , hands-down , were all from rematch . They were the most reliable , least entitled , most tolerant , and most just plain fun with my kids . One thing I 've learned : never say never !

National Work and Family Month was designated in 2003 by the U.S. Senate to highlight and communicate work-life initiatives that create healthier and more flexible work environments . A recent study has found that parents choice of child care can have an effect on the work life balance equation . <p> In a closer look at how child care can impact work life balance , Cultural Care Au Pair conducted a study of 2500 working parents who had used more than one form of child care . The survey asked parents about their previous form of child care and how their current child care choice of a live-in au pair or nanny had affected their work life balance . <p> 1 . More quality time <p> Most working parents agree that work life balance has a lot to do with time . More than two thirds of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child care allowed for more quality time with their children and more time with their spouse . Sixty two percent also found they had more time for themselves to do things like exercise and volunteer . <p> 2 . Greater flexibility <p> Flexibility is very important to working families and live-in child care provides parents with more options for scheduling and last-minute coverage . In the Cultural Care survey , 84 percent of respondents reported having more flexibility in their schedule in general . Seventy-eight percent of parents who had previously had their children in daycare centers stated that the more flexible schedule that the au pair program provides allows them to be more flexible with their work hours . <p> 3 . Higher productivity <p> That increased flexibility can translate into productivity . More than two thirds of parents indicated that their child care choice allowed them to be more focused and productive at work and 77 percent said they were less stressed about work as a result of switching to live-in child care . <p> 4 . A stress-free morning routine <p> Do smoother departures affect the feeling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parents with au pairs who had previously had their children in daycare centers reported that the morning routine was easier . Families with live-in child care find that children can take the morning at their own pace rather than be rushed out the door to meet a parents work schedule , providing everyone in the family with a more relaxed start to their day . <p> 5 . Easier after-school and evening transitions <p> Working parents report that transportation to after-school activities , homework help and meal preparation were all part of their au pairs responsibilities and made for more balanced evenings . 74% of parents surveyed agreed that the coming home/dinner time routine is easier with the help of an au pair . <p> 6 . Less time off for sick days <p> What about when the unexpected happens and a child gets sick ? According to a **25;60;TOOLONG , Meeting the Needs of Todays Families , the illness of a child causes a parent to miss between six and 29 days of work annually .

Overall , 90% of the respondents to the Cultural Care Au Pair survey felt that they have better work life balance because they have an au pair , indicating that child care choice , and choosing a flexible , live-in option , may be a factor predictive of work life balance .

Their au pairsfrom Germany , Switzerland , South Africa and Nicaraguahave helped care for their three active boys : Samuel and Dillon ( 5 years ) and Ryan ( 3 years ) . We asked Julie to share a little bit about why her family has hosted au pairs for so many years and this is what she had to say . <p> What other forms of childcare have you used besides au pairs ? We did the traditional day care facility when the twins were 3 months old . <p> Why did you switch ?

One big advantage of having an in-home au pair is the convenience . As the kids get older , they 're starting to have more and more after-school activities . Its nice to know that theyll get to their activity safe and on time . Another advantage is that it is nice to have someone from another culture to educate the kids . Its fun to hear them learn new words in another language . They get very excited as well . The twins will be six in January and we 've been using au pairs since before they were one . Weve made lifelong friends from all over the globe . Also cost . The cost of childcare in America is outrageous .

At first I was concerned about the privacy but in our experiences our au pairs have always made friends fast and were always out going places and enjoying their time in America .

Also , you have to remember that they 're taking care of your children , so if you like things done a certain way , do n't  feel bad about it , just make sure you communicate those details to your au pair . It will make everything easier in the long run to be open and to communicate things clearly . <p> Anything else to add ?

@@41904246 @1904246/ <h> Home daycare vs. au pair childcare <p> February 28 , 2013 <p> When you start researching childcare , you might be surprised to learn there are so many different options to explore . I was surprised to learn that there are several different types of daycare options in my area . Besides the large corporate daycare chains , I discovered that there are many home daycares , where a small number of children are cared for in someones private home . It was helpful for me to go through a list of pros and cons of putting my son in a home daycare versus with an au pair or other forms of childcare . <p> What is Home Daycare ? <p> Home daycare , also known as " in home daycare " or " family day care " are childcare providers who operate out of their home and take care of a limited number of children . Rules and regulations for home daycares vary by state , and some home daycares may not even be properly licensed . Licensed home daycare providers must meet the standards for health @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the states regulators . The number of children allowed in a home daycare also varies by state , but generally one childcare provider can take care of up to 6 children , or up to 10 with the help of a qualified assistant . <p> Benefits of Home Daycare <p> Many families choose home daycare , especially for infants , due to the fact that the children are looked after in a home environment . Some parents feel that being in a home daycare will make the child feel more comfortable and safe than being in a more institutional setting . A study on Child Care and Child Development in 2001 showed that children who were in a home daycare were more compliant and less aggressive than those in a daycare center . Another study showed that small groups and a safe and appropriate environment for children were the highest indicators of quality for home daycares . <p> Another major benefit is that the cost of home daycare is generally more affordable than larger daycare centers or nanny care . However , hours of coverage may be more limited , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ food , cost of transportation to and from the home daycare , etc . <p> Challenges with Home Daycare <p> One of the biggest challenges with home daycare is making sure that the home daycare providers maintain a safe and appropriate environment for the children . Since home daycares generally do n't  have separate areas for infants , toddlers and school age children , you should make sure that the environment is both safe for your childs age , while also being stimulating . It is important to check that the home daycare provider is licensed and in compliance with all state regulations . You should also ask for references from other families who currently use the home daycare and make sure they are happy with the conditions and care the family daycare provides . Child Care Aware published a great guide to evaluating a home daycare provider . <p> Home daycare vs . Au Pair Childcare <p> Au pair childcare is an option that shares many of the benefits of an in home daycare . The biggest advantage is that au pairs provide childcare within your own home , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ age-appropriate stimulation . Having your children cared for in your own home can also limit the number of illnesses they contract compared to children in a daycare environment . You can also designate how much time your child spends doing activities like outdoor play or reading or even attending other educational activities . With an au pair , your child or children are likely to get more 1-on-1 interaction with their caregiver , which has been shown to assist childhood development and foster healthy attachment . <p> In terms of cost , au pairs can be even more affordable than in home daycares in many communities . Averaging just $1,579 per month , an au pair is especially affordable if you have more than one child since the cost of an au pair is per family , and does not scale up with additional children . Sending two or more children to a home daycare can become quite expensive . <p> Hours of coverage are also more flexible with an au pair than with an in home daycare . Home daycare hours and schedules are set by the provider and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parents to get to both drop-off and pick-up on time . With an au pair , you set the hours of childcare you need , up to 45 hours per week . You might need coverage for evenings , early mornings or even on weekends , and an au pair offers that flexibility . Not to mention , you cant beat the fact that you do n't  have to do drop-off or pick-up at all ! Your children can be in their pajamas when you leave the house or can be bathed and ready for bed when you come home . Plus au pairs can help with some household tasks like preparing meals and doing laundry for the kids . <p> Another consideration is that many home day cares have long waiting lists due to the limited number of children they can care for . If you find a home daycare that has the right hours and is in a convenient location , you may need to wait months before they can accept your child(ren) . When you host an au pair , you typically need to select an au @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to begin if they are coming from overseas . Or , you have the option of selecting an au pair who is already in the country and can come to your home almost immediately . <p> Finally , with an au pair , you have the ability to introduce your kids to a new language and culture , or to help deepen roots to a culture that is already part of your heritage . Cultural Care recruits au pairs from over 20 countries , and promotes a cultural exchange experience that benefits both the au pair and the host family . <p> Choosing home daycare vs. au pair childcare <p> So , which option is right for your family ? Only you can decide , and every child and familys needs are different . Do your research , trust your instincts and you will likely make the right decision for your family .

There are so many options out there , and all of them have their pros and cons . One of the main daycare vs. nanny ( or au pair ) debates is about whether its better for kids to be around other kids and learn social skills or to have more individualized care . <p> A number of studies have looked at the effects of daycare and nanny care on childrens academic achievement and behavioral problems . Several of those studies showed that children who spent long hours in daycare centers displayed more behavioral problems , and that these behavioral problems persisted even into adolescence ( Belsky , 2001 ; Lamb &amp; Ahnert , 2006 ; Loeb et al. , 2007 ) . On the other hand , another study showed that a high quality daycare center can have a positive influence on childrens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As a new parent , I researched the daycare centers near my office , but found them to be prohibitively expensive ( more than my mortgage ! ) and a little bit too institutional for my taste .

There was such a wide range of personalities and experience , and it was hard to know who to choose . Plus , I worried my son would be missing out on learning how to share and how to behave around other kids . <p> I 'd love to be able to follow the advice of a scientific study that tells me exactly what to do to ensure that my child grows up to be the smartest , most well-adjusted kid on the block .

Although we luckily did not experience the level of devastation that many in our area suffered , our house was without electricity for over 1 week with freezing temperatures outside days after her arrival .

Grandma was very upset and felt helpless . I saw her anxiety level rise while we were on FaceTime and needed someone to take charge of the situation for me because I was still in Philadelphia with Esther , the day before her discharge . You took control of the situation , because not only was Grandma upset , but Ezra of course was acting like a lunatic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hospital . Only you and Grandma know what it took to console him and get yourselves together to get him out of the house for the repair of his ear , which had been torn in half . This situation showed us your ability to remain calm and collected in an emergency , which is exactly what we were looking for from the very beginning . <p> We are blessed to have received you into our home and our hearts . We see God caring for our kids through your delicate , sweet , loving hands every day . You never complain ( no problema is your favorite phrase ) , and you do your job with elegance and expertise . We love you , our children love you , and we secretly hope that you will not leave us this summer , but only God knows . Thank you for caring for us and allowing us to be a part of your life . We appreciate the sacrifice you have made to be so far away from your family , to open yourself to a new culture , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bless you and grant you much peace as you embark on your wonderful future , hopefully with several kids of your own to be blessed by your loving hands . <p> While Michelle admits she would love for Annie to stay another year with them , " Ultimately I want what 's best for her .

Then shell ask all of you to work on it to improve the situation for a couple of weeks . <p> If after trying to work things out the situation just ca n't be resolved , an exit interview is conducted . At this meeting , everyone comes to an agreement about what will be happening in the coming weeks . The au pair has to stay with the host family for up to two weeks during her replacement .

" <p> The Rosen family with their first Chinese au pair , Hong Wang . <p> Erica and Brad Rosen , host parents in Lincoln , MA , have two boys , ages 5 and 3 years , and they have hosted Chinese au pairs since 2010 . Says Erica , " One of the things that is very important to us is that our children learn a second language as early and as " naturally " as possible . So we expect that their au pair speaks only Chinese with them , at all timesunless English is necessary to briefly deal with a safety concern . " Asher and Brenner are now fluent in Chinesea great advantage for navigating a global workplace later in life . <p> In order to ensure host children become truly bilingual , it does take discipline and effort from both parents and au pairs . Host parents need to commit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world year after year if they want language immersion to continue . They should also be upfront about their wishes when interviewing potential candidates . Says Alyson Rhodes , Sales and Placement Director for Cultural Care Au Pair , " If a host family wants their au pair to be speaking only their native language with the kids , they should mention that during their interview and in their application so au pairs are clued in . One of the reasons au pairs come to the U.S. is to strengthen their English skills , so they will also want to be reassured that theyll be speaking English when the parents are around . " Au pairs also need to be vigilant about speaking only their native language when around the children . Usually this is not a problem and is a welcome break from English . <p> Parents should also factor in how the age of their children will affect their ability to learn a new language from their au pair . According to the American Council on the Teaching of Foreign Languages ( ACTFL ) , " Beginning foreign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advanced levels of proficiencies in one or more languages . In addition , younger learners still possess the capacity to develop near native-like pronunciation and intonation in a new language . " In other words , the younger your children are when first exposed to an au pairs language , the easier it will be for them to become bilingual . <p> The Bauer family has hosted a total of 10 au pairs to help Alex and Elena master the German language . <p> 2 . Families whose children are already learning another languagebut need helpThere are some host families who choose the au pair program at least in part to support language learning that is happening at home or at their childrens immersion schools . So , they 're not relying on their au pairs to teach their children a new language from scratch , but rather to help them master a second language they already use . <p> For Sheila and Andi Bauer , host parents in Boxborough , MA , hosting German au pairs was a way to help their two children learn their dads native language . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has communicated with Elena and Alex in German since they were born . But , it can be hard to for children to become bilingual if they do n't  hear a balance of both languages . According to the Linguistic Society of America , " Children need to hear both languages often and in a variety of circumstances . If they hear one language less than the other it is essential to find other sources of exposure and other ways of creating the sense of need . " <p> The Bauers ten German au pairs helped fill that gap . Says Sheila , " Both of my kids , who are now 10 and 8 , are fluent in German and their au pairs helped make that possible . " <p> Host mom Rosa Hatton , whose family lives in southern FL , says , " We chose Wendi because she is from Mexico and I come from a Mexican-American family . I wanted my daughter Juliana to learn a Mexican dialect of Spanish and also be exposed to the Mexican culture and traditions from someone other than myself . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Juliana can practice her Spanish and continue learning . " One-year-old Juliana is now speaking in both English and Spanish . <p> Anna Greka , a host mom in Milton , MA , has two sons who attend a French immersion program at their school .

" <p> The Matte children are learning some German words and phrases from their German au pair Franziska . <p> 3 . Families who enjoy the cultural exchange but do n't  expect their kids will become bi-lingualMost Cultural Care host families fall under this categorythey appreciate the exposure to foreign languages and are simply happy to hear their children learning and using simple words and songs in their au pairs language . <p> Trieste Matte , whose first au pair Franziska arrived from Germany in June 2012 says , " My children now have a German lullaby at bedtime , they are learning German phrases , and we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , host mom Carrie Williams , says of her Danish au pair Liv , " She has taught us a few Danish words though we seemingly lack the ability to pronounce many of them correctly .

Liv has cooked lots of Danish recipes for us . We 've also learned about some of her holiday traditions and songs .

Advice from the experts <p> March 17 , 2014 <p> We recently asked our host families what advice they would give to someone who is considering au pair childcare . And , the advice ? Its real , honest advice that we will be sharing over the next couple of weeks as it relates to the benefits ( and challenges ) of au pair childcare . <p> Choosing your childcare is one of the biggest decisions you 'll make . There is a lot at stake , and its a personal decisionand can become even more personal when welcoming an au pair to live with you . To families unfamiliar with the program , the thought of having a young adult between the ages of 18 26 years old live with them can be daunting . But , according to our host families , taking that leap of faith with live-in childcare has turned out to be the biggest AND the best decision they 've made . <p> " I can understand a concern in regards to the comfort level of welcoming a stranger into your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ However , we have been nothing be pleased with the au pairs we have welcomed .

With both parents working , and one regularly travelling for work , we needed the assistance . Make sure you are comfortable with someone living in your house , be able to provide them with their own space and be willing to welcome them in as a part of the family . " -Nesbit family , MA <p> " If you are open to having someone love with you it is a wonderful option for high quality care . I needed reliable , high quality , cost effective childcare .

" Murray family , SC <p> " We were intrigued by the idea of cultural exchange and the possibility that our children could be bilingual if we selected au pair with a different native tongue . Being in their 20s , au pairs tend to have a lot of energy which is an ideal quality for the childcare of newborns and toddlers . Initially , we were concerned about the idea of having someone live with us , but we have realized that the advantages definitely outweigh losing access to a bedroom in your home . When our au pair is on vacation or out for the evening , our home seems to be missing something wonderful that is around when she is home . " -Wang family , CA <p> " How does taking care of new-born triplets AND a 2 year old sound ? !

The information she shared about CT was interesting but not nearly as compelling as details about her personal journey to becoming an au pair . She joined the Clark family in March of 2014 and just returned home this past March . Her storyin her own wordsis below . <p> I 'm so thankful that Connecticut chose me , or the other way around . But it was meant to be . Beforehand I have to say , that my past was not that great . Ever since I can remember I was the bullied girl .

I was a target for everyone . <p> This is Svenjaits hard to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Why was I bullied ? I 'm still asking myself the same question . But it was mostly about my appearance . I was a really skinny child , with braces and a " skin disease " called neurodermatitis . That 's enough for becoming a outsider . But I was also interested in different stuff than most other kids my age . I always searched for different things , because I did n't  want to stick to the pattern in our little village . <p> So how do you grow a healthy image of yourself , how do you develop self-confidence and become a lovable person ? I did n't  know . It was always in my head to go away , because everything here seemed negative . I needed a reboot . I gained some confidence by being a cheerleading and through my job and then the biggest reason : I had my best friend Theresa . We always did everything together . <p> Svenja and her " soulmate " Theresa cheering on the Boston Red Sox . <p> My " soulmate " Theresa and I grew up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together to become au pairs and break through and make the last step towards being fully confident . She actually travelled one week later than me to the U.S. Her host family was in MA and mine was in CT . <p> So anyways , Connecticut was the place where I could finally be myself , leave the past behind and just be happy . I would have never dreamed this could happen , but the past year was such a success for my health , and I made connections that will last forever in my heart . I recorded a song , I met musicians , I met my best friend , and I met the most gorgeous host family I could ever wish for . I traveled the U.S. with my best friend , and I lived the way I wanted to live for one year . And everything stared in Connecticut . <p> Her year in America was a chance to build emotional strength and confidence . <p> Earlier this year , my host family and I were having a " Hello-Goodbye " dinner , where we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ welcome her and say goodbye to me . Before that I was searching for a Connecticut state flag and I asked my host dad for advice on where I could find one . His answer was kinda shady , which was weird , because he s a perfectionist and knows almost everything . So I figured , I would just get one online when I moved back to Germany . Meanwhile at the dinner , my host dad was so excited to give me his goodbye gift . He said : " Thank you for the past year , we really enjoyed having you in our family and well miss you , so open it up ! " I did . And there was the CT flag in it , it was so mad cute !

Never ever before , did someone thank me in such kind way . Never ever did someone honor me that much and or just be happy that I was there one year for their family . It was a special moment I 'll never forget my whole life . It tears me up every time I think about it . Life gave me the biggest present I could have ever received : true happiness . Connecticut is my second home and its a place that is like paradise for me because it holds so much good memories in it . <p> Svenjas tattoo of the state of Connecticut is a constant reminder of her time as an au pair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I had an idea . Because I knew , when the day arrived to go back to Germany , there would be rainy days where you just want to go back and be free again .

If there 's a day when Im anxious , not confident about myself or I just lose track I look at my CT tattoo and remind myself of what I 'm able to do in life and where I was the best of myself and happy . It gives me back my strength and the feeling that I 'm great how I am , and that everything will be alright . <p> Now that I 'm home in Germany , I just got my part time job with Cultural Care !

I 'm currently applying for my studies as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ project with a great connection I 've made with a street musician .

To sum up , I can say that I 'm happy for all the experience I 've had even as a child , teenager , etc. but especially for the time I spent as an au pair , because it was worth it . It made me a really kind and sensitive person , who 's able to understand others a lot better and to find out where I belong . <p> To hear some of Svenjas music , watch her YouTube video , recorded with a friend in CT .

@@41904270 @1904270/ <p> You might think once you decide to host an au pair that you need to provide her with all the luxuries some of todays entitled young people demandthings like her own bathroom , car , cell phone , computer , etc . The fact is , what an au pair actually requires is her own bedroom , love and respect from her host family and enough of all that extra stuff to do her job and get to her classes , au pair meetings and social engagements . <p> Au pair requirements <p> The U.S. Department of State stipulates that an au pair needs to have her own bedroom with a doorfor obvious reasons . Au pairs are also entitled to up to a $500 payment towards their educational component , and transportation to and from their classes . That can be in the form of use of the family car , or a fare to take public transit . <p> Au pairs also need love and respect from their host families in order to have a successful yearthis is far more important to them than any material @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other stuff ? Well , here 's what some of our program participants have to say about that : <p> Bathroom Although providing an au pair with her own bathroom is nice , many au pairs share a bathroom with the kids or even the whole family . Portland , OR host mom Krista Reitberg and her family share their homes one bathroom with their au pairs . So , if you have an extra bathroom , its nice for an au pair to have her own , but its certainly not required . <p> Car Depending on where you live and what your schedule is like , you many or may not need your au pair to drive . Since I live in a suburb just outside Boston with good public transportation , our future au pair wont need a carfor her childcare duties or personal engagements . If you need your au pair to drive as part of her childcare responsibilities and to get to classes and meetings , you 'll need to provide her with a car .

If you want to be able to keep in constant contact with her , then yes . But families have come up with several different ways to keep costs down and accountability in check . According to aupairmom.com contributors , one host mom puts everyone in her family on one planthe extra cost for her au pair is only about $10 per month . She says , " A friend of mine uses a strict pay-as-you-go plan . She puts a certain amount she feels is reasonable into the account each month and the au pair pays the rest . " Another mom shares , " Several of my au pairs , including our current au pair , arranged their own cell phone and so I compensated them in other ways ( i.e. Netflix subscription ) .

One piece of the puzzle some parents forget to consider is an au pairs DISC assessment . <p> Cultural Care Au Pair requires all au pairs to take the DISC assessmenta test that measures personality traits and identifies how someone is likely to react in certain situations . The results of this assessment can be found in each au pairs candidates application in the bottom section of the Personal Info tab . <p> The " Drive " scale measures how assertive someone is . <p> The " Influence " scale relates to social situations and communication . <p> The " Steadiness " scale measures an au pairs demeanor and how well she deals with change . <p> Lastly , the " Compliance " scale measures how much structure and organization someone is comfortable with . <p> " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There are no right or wrong answers . If you have the knowledge on how someone best functions , use this to your advantage , " says Sasha Williams , a Cultural Care placement manager . " When looking at an au pairs DISC assessment its most important for parents to consider how the results will affect three big areas : communication style , structure and leadership and independence and time spent with the family . " <p> Communication styleCommunication is the single most important component to a successful au pair year , so its wise to look at an au pairs " I " score to get a sense of her preferred style . One of the host families Sasha was working with in WA lamented that at the end of each day , her au pair would withdraw to her room then head out with friends . The host mom would have preferred her au pair to hang out and chat for five minutes about the day . Lisa Sousa , a host mom in MA , also found that one of her au pairs was more socially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family dynamic . In both cases , their au pairs had lower " I " scores . The mom in WA just matched with her next au pair and specifically chose a candidate with a high " I " or Influence score .

" Lisa also just matched with an au pair with a higher " Influence " score . <p> On the other hand , there are many host parents who crave a bit more privacy and would actually appreciate an au pair who retired to her room each evening . They might not need a high " I " scorer . Its interesting to note that how an au pair communicates with her host parents is every bit as important as how communicates with the kids . <p> Structure and leadershipDo you : <p> Set an agenda on a weekly basis and make consistent use of Cultural Care Au Pairs Communication Log ? <p> Expect your au pair to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just as long as your kids are having fun and feeling loved ? <p> Sasha recommends parents consider a candidates DISC score in relation to how they answer this question . " Under steadiness , you might see a line like You get restless when involved in routine and repetitive work/activities. Families with school-aged kids may worry about how a candidate copes with a daily grind of school , sports , homework , and meal preparation without a lot of variety . " <p> Other families want to see their au pair empowered , and this is especially true with host kids under four . One common refrain I hear is : I want a candidate that has common senseone that knows how to step in , take charge. Lines like " You are willing to take an unconventional approach " in compliance , are something to look for . Under D ( dominance ) you might see lines like individual is goal-oriented and thrives on competition.

" <p> Independence and spending time with the familyWhile some families want their au pair to spend time off with them , others prefer that their au pairs make their own plans with friends , travel and get out and about . Says Sasha , " Under Influence , you might find a candidate is comfortable working alone or in Compliance , willing to try the untried. This person might be more independent . " If this is the case , its also important to be mindful of what opportunities your au pair will have to socialize . Will she have use of the car ? Is there public transportation where you live ? How many other au pairs are in your area ? <p> Sasha shares , " Host families that do n't  mind more of a homebody and want someone who really becomes part of the family might look at the " D " score for comments like " You are easy-going and congenial " and " You tend to be reactive rather than pro-active . " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that look for comments like these because both of them love having essentially an older niece that will spend time with them as a family , going to the movies , yoga , etc . " <p> In the grand scheme of matching , its best to consider the DISC results in combination with all of the other important elements of an au pairs application : her childcare experiences , jobs shes had outside childcare , her schooling and career goals , the relationships she has with her natural family and friends . If all else looks good but something on the DISC assessment does n't  sit right with you , talk it out with your placement manager or au pair to make sure its nothing that will pose a challenge later on . If all seems in tune with your familys dynamic , you can be even more confident an au pair is the right fit for you .

In addition to selecting three finalists to submit to IAPA for this prestigious award , Cultural Care Au Pair selects one outstanding au pair from each state to honor as the Au Pair of the Year . Stefania Gomez Luna of Colombia is recognized as the Au Pair of the Year from Georgia for 2013 . Stefania lives with the Smythe family and cares for their three year old daughter , Mallory . <p> The Smythes first decided on au pair childcare for several reasons . The first was the individualized childcare approach as both parents travel frequently . " It has always been comforting to know that Mallory would be well taken care of at home , especially as a newborn , " says host father , Nicholas . Secondly , they loved the idea of cultural exchange . " Before we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and gained so much from the experience . Having an au pair is another way to pass that experience onto others as well as raise a child that can appreciate a world without borders and an international marketplace . " Finally , the language component of the au pair program played a role in their child care decision . Nicholas says , " To date , the au pair program has exceeded our wildest expectations as our daughter now knows all about Colombia , Spanish , and our au pair is thoroughly ingrained in American Culture . Similarly , my wife and I are sold on our first visit to Colombia in the coming years ! " <p> Following is their nomination essay : <p> " Stefania Gomez Luna is known to my wife and me as Steffie and to our daughter as Fluffy. Steffie came to our family in July of 2011 as a shy , nineteen year old girl from Colombia that knew a fair amount about kids but not a lot about our family . To watch what has happened over the past eighteen months with Steffie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ integrated so well into our family that we cant imagine our family without her . Some au pairs live in the basement or somewhat further away from the hustle and bustle of the household . Our au pair did n't  have that option as her room was across from the master bedroom and just down the hall from our daughter . We plan most evening meals as family meals , so for Steffie there was n't much of a place to hide . The good thing is that she took to our family like a duck takes to water . We taught her about our traditions like eating red beans and rice on Mondays ( a salute to my New Orleans heritage ) or the way we all decorate the house depending on the seasons . Steffie in turn taught us about Colombian cuisine and taught us to cook arepas for breakfast ( a new tradition that will endure well after she leaves ) . I almost laugh as I write that Steffie did n't  really know how to cook when she first got here but learned some Colombian recipes over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Steffie and my wife are baking so many cakes , cupcakes , and cookies together now that its an absolute wonder that I can still fit into my clothes . <p> If you were to meet Steffie , youd notice how small she is , which is made ironic by how big her heart is . She is kind and considerate to a fault always remembering to give birthday cards and write thank you notes for gifts shes received . I remember on my wife and my wedding anniversary how I woke up that morning and found small note outside my bedroom door wishing us a happy day . Another aspect that we love about Steffie is her nurturing and developmental attitude she takes to taking care of our daughter . Mallory just turned three and would n't be the same without Steffie . Not only is Mallory bilingual because of Steffie but she 's far better off in terms of academic and emotional development . Steffie finds so many wonderful activities for Mallory . For instance , one day I came home from work to find Mallory and Steffie just getting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spanish story time . English story time is also a common occurrence . Crafts from Michaels and various art projects just appear on the refrigerator door .

My words do n't  do it justice but it was the loving and tender way that she interacted in this game that made it so memorable . Flashcards , reading , singing , and dancing are all just some of the examples that highlight the fun environment she creates for Mallory . <p> Well be sad to see Steffie go back to Colombia in July of next year . We also know that her time with us has been but a stepping stone in her lifes journey as she goes home to finish her degree and become an industrial engineer .

While we completely understood and supported her , we were left franticly trying to figure out what to do next . The timing was not great to say the least . We were not prepared and about to have a house full of family for the next 10 days . I have to admit I was a bit overwhelmed at the thought of interviewing and training someone new immediately following the holiday rush . Not to mention the emotional toll it was going to take to say goodbye to someone we cared for very much and whom we considered to be our little girls best friend .

But , because we were looking at the in-country pool which is smaller , we knew we had to be open minded on things like , country , age , and departure date .

We had updated our handbook , had a plan in place for the first few days , we knew what to expect this time around and were ready to welcome our new au pair . <p> Saying goodbye was probably the hardest thing to do in the whole experience . I was surprised at how emotional it was to watch our au pair say her goodbyes to our baby . I realized it was probably harder on her than it was on us .

And to our delight she decided to extend with us , so my concerns about her early departure are irrelevant ! <p> Having made it through the experience , I learned that an unexpected change can be positive even when you think the timing couldnt be worse ! It gives you a chance to evaluate what has and has n't  worked ; the chance to revise your household handbook and/or rules ; if you hang onto the resources you have created you do n't  have to recreate the wheel , you can use what you have ; staying open-minded helps you pick the best candidate for your family ; saying goodbye can be super painful but it does n't  mean goodbye @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this next relationship more experienced and better prepared for what to expect .

In this article , we will look at the differences in the matching process once you have decided to host an au pair . Additionally , we will discuss the training that au pairs undergo before they come to start their year as an au pair . <p> How you find an au pair : the matching process <p> Finding the right au pair for your family can be daunting . It is as much an art as it is a science . Like dating in the online era , finding an au pair can be done almost entirely online these days . Most au pair agencies have online databases you can browse to find an au pair for your family , though generally , they only show a limited number of au pair profiles or just a preview of the au pair profiles until you register with the au pair agency . <p> Once you have decided to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an au pair agency , you can start reviewing the full profiles of that agencys au pair candidates . Some of the au pair agencies online databases of au pairs have filters where you can narrow your search of au pairs by the language the au pair speaks and whether they are infant qualified . Cultural Care Au Pair offers a range of filters including au pairs country , gender , age , driving status , age of children cared for , and whether they are OK with pets . You can also exclude older profiles if you just want to see au pairs who have been added to the database recently . <p> These filters can help you narrow your search for an au pair to a more reasonable number of candidates , but you may still feel overwhelmed or not know where to start . If you have narrowed down your candidates based on all of the criteria that are important to your family , be sure to review the au pair profiles carefully .

Your placement manager will review your familys needs and gain an understanding of what you want from your au pair . S/he will then research the database and propose candidates for your review . <p> One important thing to consider is how an au pair agency handles au pairs who are under review by a host family . Some au pair agencies allow multiple host families to review and interview au pair candidates at once . This can lead families to feel that they are competing for the same au pair and that they have to rush through the interview process in order to get an au pair before another family does . <p> Alternatively , Cultural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ families have exclusive rights to review their primary au pair candidate without other host families having access to that au pairs profile .

Make sure you have covered all your important questions and concerns during your au pair interview and do n't  hesitate to talk through any hesitations you have with your au pair agency . <p> Au pair training <p> Once you have selected your au pair , the au pair agency will help the au pair secure her visa and make her travel arrangements .

Victoria Svensson , Cultural Cares Recruitment Director for Sweden ( pictured below ) , shares why she thinks families should consider an au pair from Sweden . <p> GENERAL CHARACTERISTICSSwedish au pairs are great becauseThey speak English very well and although recent high school graduates , they are highly educated and mature for their age . They are responsible , independent and open to different family situations . Also , they are very strong drivers , especially since they are used to driving in winter conditions . <p> Cultural differences that are positive : Swedish au pairs are generally well-behaved and not very confrontational . They avoid conflict and tend to look for solutions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learn a lot about American culture and share their own . Swedes like to be included as family members , but are also very independent and are used to balancing family and their social life . <p> Cultural differences that could prove challenging : Swedes avoid conflict , which sometimes can lead to problems being hidden under the surface . Also , Swedes can be a little more reserved when it comes to sharing emotions with people they do n't  know well , so in order to get an honest answer you might need to ask more than once how they are doing or what 's on their mind . <p> Sometimes its confusing or surprising for a Swede to have rules such as curfews , since an 18-year old is considered an adult in Sweden , and usually lives a very independent life . Its important to take the time to explain why rules and mutual trust is important in a new environment . <p> ENGLISH LANGUAGE SKILLSHow do au pairs from Sweden typically learn English , and what are their strengths and weaknesses regarding written and oral mastery of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a mandatory part of their education and one must be English . English studies start at age 8-9 and we start studying another language at age 12 .

Swedes generally travel a lot , so most Swedes have gotten used to speak English when they travel . <p> DRIVING SKILLSTypically au pairs start driving around age : 16 <p> Au pairs in your country can obtain a drivers license at the age of : 18 <p> What are the steps involved in obtaining a drivers license ? Most Swedes start driving by practicing with their parents . The majority of Swedes also take drivers education classes prior to the driving exam .

In Sweden , most families only have one or two cars available , so typically au pairs borrow the family car , after getting their license . Most Swedes are used to driving on highways , country roads in smaller cities . They are also very used to snowy , rainy and icy conditions . <p> Typically , au pairs from Sweden have experience:Driving smaller vehicles , driving in the snow , driving on highways , driving on country roads , driving alone and driving with children . <p> Typically , au pairs from Sweden do not have much experience:Driving larger vehicles <p> CHILDCARE EXPERIENCEAu pairs from Sweden typically get their childcare experience by:Babysitting younger siblings , babysitting extended family members , babysitting children of family friends/neighbors , working in a kindergarten , working in a daycare center , coaching childrens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tutoring . <p> EDUCATIONIn Sweden , school from the age of 6-15 is required and most students attend public school . The educational system is divided into three broad levels : primary , secondary and " high school " . Primary and secondary are mandatory . During high school you can choose to either study social science or science which prepares you for higher studies . You can also attend a vocational school , where you still get prepared to attend university later in life , while also learning a profession , like nursing , child minder or hairdresser . Most au pairs take this year as a gap year between high school and university.FAMILY LIFEIn Sweden its common to have 2-3 children , so most au pair applicants have siblings . Its not common to have people work in your home . For example , gardeners , cleaners , nannies , etc , are unfamiliar to most Swedes . Instead , there 's always something everyone in the family help out with . Also , its natural to eat together as a family after work/school .

Its important to start talking about the new au pair early and often , so kids can ask questions and voice any concerns . Specific areas you should discuss ( when age appropriate ) include : cultural and language differences and how to work through communication issues , schedule and routine changes , and the role and authority that the new au pair will have .

Having an au pair was by far the most economical choice for at home care . <p> Why does this work better for you ? <p> Inevitably , things come up with having three children in a busy household .

She shares a common love of music , adventure and playfulness . She was also extremely prompt in following up on our interview questions and reaching out to the office in Vienna to share that she would like to be our au pair . Since she has been here , she 's proved every day that she 's the right fit for our kids . <p> What were your concerns about welcoming an au pair ? <p> We were at first concerned with welcoming her because of the size of our home . We live in an area where the homes are not large , so space would be an issue . We found a way around that by bunking our 2 older children and creating a separate play area in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can go outside . Also we chose an au pair who we thought would be pretty independent and want to connect with other au pairs , which meant we very rarely are all home at the same time ! <p> What 's it like actually having an au pair living with you ? <p> An adjustment ! But just because they live with you full time , does n't  mean you will always be in each others space . Our au pair goes out on her time off or travels on long weekends . On the flip side , having her in our home means another adult to keep track of all these kids ! <p> How do you schedule your au pairs 45 hours per week ? <p> Yvonne has a pretty regular schedule . We use roughly 40 hrs a week . She spends a good majority of her time with our youngest , but is working to help me get the older kids off to school in the a.m. and keeps an eye on our youngest while I prep dinner and help the older children with homework . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 5 hours for " date night .

She and her family have given us lovely gifts from their home country including sweets , honey , nuts ( from a tree in her great uncles yard ) . She baked her favorite Christmas cookies with us at Christmas and shared the holiday traditions that her family enjoys in Austria . <p> What advice would you give other families who are considering this type of childcare ? <p> When I first considered au pair childcare , the idea came with the stigma that it was for the " wealthy " and would be very expensive . The more I weighed all of the options that were available to us , I found that au @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needs .

Not only do we get childcare , that is consistent , reliable , loving and tireless , but we get the benefit of a big sister for Norra , exposure for my kids to another culture ( they are learning German with Yvonne ) and a unique opportunity to share our American family ! We look forward to lots of cook outs , fireworks , beach fun and travel with Yvonne this summer , were proud to be able to offer her the American experience she wanted !

My dad still had so much energy which nobody could believe . He clapped everyones hands on the side and was the happiest man on the earth for 4 1/2 hours . That inspired me and made me so happy . I did n't  have as much energy left but we continued without walking and the last two miles felt longer than anything before in my life . But , we sped up every mile , that was so unbelievable .

I talked with them about how parents can make the interview process most successfulhere are some of their best tips for interviewing au pair candidates . <p> 1 . Making an appointment for the first call can be helpfulbut do n't  be afraid to just call and get started Some parents prefer to set up an appointment to chat with an au pair but there 's nothing wrong with simply calling to schedule an interview . We even created a guide to interview questions so you can prepare ! <p> 2 . Limit the first conversation to 1/2 hourSpeaking in a different language to a potential family can be emotionally taxing for au pairs . After about + hour , their energy and capacity for verbal exchange may drop considerably . But if time seems to be flying by and personalities just seem to click , let the conversation take its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ details for your second conversation ; and let them know what you want to cover during that callIf you 've got some tough questions for an au pair , save them for the second call . Same goes for sharing detailed information about schedule , rules , etc . The first phone call is better reserved for introducing your family and community and asking some of the simpler questions on your list . It may even be helpful to provide candidates with a list of topics and questions you plan to cover in any subsequent conversationsthat is up to you . <p> 4 . Consider using SkypeMost of our families use Skype video conferencing to interview au pairs when possible . Families can learn about a candidate just by watching her body language and facial expressions , and au pairs have an easier time understanding the conversation when they can see the person talking . <p> 5 . Ask kids and/or au pair to join in on the 2nd or 3rd callIf you plan on involving your children and/or your au pair in the interview process , ask them to join @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ au pair to too many family members in the beginning can be overwhelming . That being said , do n't  hesitate to allow your children and current au pair to weigh in on potential candidates . Oftentimes their opinions will help solidify a " yes " or " no " very quickly . <p> 6 . Be positiveNo matter what kind of day you 've had , make sure you 've got a smile on your face and keep the conversation positive . <p> 7 . Speak slowly and avoid slangAmericans have a habit of doing everything quicklyso make sure to slow down your conversation and avoid using words au pairs do n't  learn in their English studies back home . <p> 8 . Give au pairs the chance to interview you ! Let potential candidates know they will have a chance to interview you . Not only will they appreciate the opportunity to get their questions answered , but you can gain a lot of insight about a candidate based on what she wants to know . If her first three questions are : " Will I have weekends off ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I use the car ? " you might be tipped off that this is n't the mellow , homebody candidate you were hoping for . <p> 9 . Make sure to have 2-3 conversations with your final matchIt will probably take at least 2-3 conversations to determine whether a candidate is the right fit for you . <p> 10 . Go with your gutIn addition to all of the information you consider from an au pairs profile and during phone and Skype interviews , in the end , making a decision often involves listening to your gut feelings . If an au pair looks perfect " on paper " but the match does n't  feel right , trust your instincts . On the other hand , if there is nothing that stands out in particular about an applicants profile but she has the basic qualifications you are looking for and you get a great feeling about her , do n't  be afraid to extend her an offer to join your family ! <p> Host families : what are your interviewing best practices ?

Read each one out loud to yourself in front of the mirror . This will help you feel more prepared . <p> Have rules for explaining your rules . For example , ask the person who is listening to wait until each one has been read and explained before asking questions . Set a time frame for the rules discussion ( " this meeting will be 30 minutes long so we will not have time to discuss anything else at this time .

Stay firm and clear in your intention , and precise in your preparation and execution . Within the setting of a meeting , refer to your written words . Check in after each point , by welcoming any questions or need for clarification . If you become frustrated reset yourself and continue to move forward .

Gretchen Bonasera is head chef and owner of The Food Smiths , a catering company attached to her family home . Successfully running a small catering business takes much more than great cooking .

" <p> In addition to the flexibility and the ability to see the kids throughout the day , having an au pair also allows home-based business owners to overcome some of the other challenges of working from home . Although many home based business owners find themselves interacting online and on the phone with customers and vendors throughout the day , being in a home office can be socially isolating . Having an au pair provides not only a companion during the day but also allows for the opportunity to meet a friend for lunch or a walk . <p> It is also challenging to ignore the distractions of laundry , cleaning , carpooling and other necessary activities around the house .

" For home-based parents , this can mean plenty of TV-viewing to occupy kids , cookie and candy bribes to gain quiet time , interrupted phone calls and lots of frustration , " says Shellenbarger . Having an au pair eliminates too much TV time and other desperate solutions to keeping kids quiet and entertained . The best part ?

According to the National Summer Learning Association , kids lose an average of 2 months of math skills each summer , and the effects are cumulative over the years , creating a lasting achievement gap . <p> Beyond the events that are taking place around the country this Friday , there are many ways you can help your kids combat summer learning loss at home throughout the summer . <p> Reading : If your children have a summer reading list , encourage them to make progress on it by setting daily goals . If they are too young to read on their own , make sure to read aloud to them daily .

Cooking and baking require measurementsask your child to help you double a recipe , for example . You can also challenge them to plan a garden or build a fort by taking measurements and drawing plans to scale . Ask for their help organizing a yard sale or setting up a lemonade stand , and let them handle the money .

If your kids play any musical instruments , try to maintain a practice schedule throughout the summer or encourage them to form a band with friends if they are older . <p> Physical activity : Adequate exercise is equally important to the developing brains and overall health of children . Go for a family bike ride , spend a day at the community pool or organize some neighborhood games like dodge ball , capture the flag , or one-on-one basketball .

To prepare ourselves and our 3-year-old for this exciting but potentially disruptive new addition to our family , I gathered some great tips from other parents who have already had experience welcoming a new baby , and preparing older siblings for the new addition to the family . If you are facing a similar transition , hopefully this will be a useful reference guide . If you 've already been there and done that , then please share your best tips in the comments below . <p> Give your child time to adjust to the news <p> Children have different levels of understanding depending on their age . Abstract concepts and events that will seemingly happen in the distant future will be hard for younger children to grasp . It may help to give your older child plenty of time to adjust to the news that a new baby will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baby early and often can help . Make sure your tone is positive and comforting , and be sure to talk about what his or her role will be as the older sibling . <p> Give your older child some experience with other babies <p> Before your own baby arrives , try to expose your older child to other babies . Reading books about new babies , visiting friends who have babies and even signing up for an older sibling preparation class can be helpful ways to give your child a chance to understand what it will be like to have a baby in the house . <p> Get your child involved <p> Before the baby comes , discuss ways your older child can be involved with the care of the new baby . Depending on his or her age , the older sibling can help by preparing the nursery , picking out a special gift for the new baby , or just talking to the new baby in mommys tummy . You can also talk about ways to help when the baby arrives , such as bringing the baby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , feeding the baby a bottle , patting the babys back or entertaining the baby by singing or dancing . <p> Set aside special one-on-one time to make your older child feel special <p> Try to arrange to have some extra help on hand so that you can devote some quality time to your older child . If you have family nearby , schedule time for them to visit and specifically ask that they take care of the new baby while you play with your older child . If you have an au pair , you can set aside some time on a daily basis or take advantage of nap times to focus on your older child . While au pairs can not be left alone with infants under 3 months old , they can watch the baby while you are in the house , and can also help with other household tasks related to the children so that you can spend more time playing with your older child . <p> Be realistic <p> A new baby will be a big adjustment for the older sibling , so expect that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children ignore their younger siblings in the beginning , while others will display some aggression . Reinforce good behavior with praise , and be very clear that harming the baby is not allowed and recognize that this behavior is the older child expressing frustration or wanting more attention . <p> And one for you : Be prepared <p> Try to plan in advance as much as possible to make the transition smooth . Talk to your spouse about how you want to introduce the new baby to your older child .

This holiday is celebrated every year on December 13thit is a festival of light that marks the beginning of the Christmas season . The symbol of light is particularly pertinent because Sweden , Norway and Denmark are at their darkest time of the year . The day is also associated with the Italian martyr Santa Lucia who helped the poor and lonely . <p> Traditional Santa Lucia processions are still practiced by these countries today . They take place in popular public places and are led by one child who is chosen as the Lucia . She wears a white gown and candles in her hair and is followed by her posse of " star boys " ( stjSrngossar ) who carry stars on sticks and lanterns and handmaidens who bear candles ( tSrnor ) .

Nannies can be anyone employed to care for a child in its own home . <p> Nannies can work part-time , full-time or even overtime . Au pairs working conditions are regulated by the U.S. Department of State , so there are rules that must be followed . An au pair can work up to ( but no more than ) 45 hours a week , 10 hours per day . <p> Nanny fees vary widely depending on if they are part-time or full-time and where you live . Most resources quote from $400 to $600 per week . Au pairs are paid a set weekly stipend of $195.75 , as dictated by the U.S. Department of State . When an agencys fees are factored in , the total weekly cost is about $350 . <p> Some nannies are professionally trained and are in the field as a career .

Our local representatives are in every community and their role is to support you during your au pair year . <h> Meet Your Local Support in the US <p> Cultural Care Au Pair 's local childcare coordinators are a face-to-face contact for families and other au pairs , creating a nurturing community . They work hard to make the best program experience possible for host families and au pairs . And they do it because they love it . Here is what they have to say . <h> Karen , LCC in Illinois <p> In 2007 Karen organized the first Cultural Care Au Pair Chicago Area Scavenger Hunt in downtown Chicago . This is now an annual event for more than 200 au pairs and 20 LCCs in the Chicago area . <p> Over the last eight years I have worked with over a hundred au pairs , many of whom I still am in contact with via email and Facebook in their home countries in Latin America , South @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My role as a LCC has expanded my view of the world far beyond my expectations . <p> Having lived in my community since 1986 and in Lake County my entire life I know the area very well . I know the best areas to recruit quality new host families . When a family inquires about the au pair program , I know exactly where they live , the school their children attend , what church the family attends , and where the parents work . I can easily relate to their life in Lake County . This and my experience as an LCC help me show the prospective new family the advantages of the au pair program and determine if they would be a suitable host family . <p> My monthly au pair meetings are scheduled well in advance , and I encourage other LCCs in the area to join my meetings . The meetings are fun , interesting , and also include important safety topics . We go bowling , participate in charity events , visit the local fire and police department for safety presentations , host a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , walk in local parades , participate in a women 's self-defense class , attend a baseball-basketball or hockey game , dress in costume for a Halloween party , learn CPR , see the holiday tree lighting at the town square , and sometimes just go for coffee or pizza . Au pairs can expect to enjoy my monthly meeting and make new friends . <p> I have learned so much about the world and many different cultures . I also love to see how the au pairs change during their year in the US . It is so interesting to see how they mature , become more independent , adapt to a different culture , and enjoy themselves . At the end of their year many au pairs tell me how much they have changed in a positive way and how satisfied- they are with their decision to become an au pair and what the experience has meant to them . <h> Maria , LCC in Connecticut <p> Maria , a former au pair herself , is still in touch with her host family twenty five years later ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ au pairs in her group and shares examples of how each one can show how invested they are in the program and their host family . <p> After working as an LCC with Cultural Care Au Pair for the last eight years I have found that I am as passionate for the cultural exchange program as I was when I first came to the U.S. as an au pair in 1986 . The experiences that I work to create as the Local Childcare Coordinator include a successful integration of the au pair into an American family , the American culture , and the creation of lifelong friendships shared between au pairs around the globe . <p> My job as an LCC brings a variety of responsibilities , but my favorite is helping foster strong relationships between my au pairs and their host families .

I also love organizing monthly au pair meetings to add to our au pair 's cultural experience and my group has enjoyed outings such as attending the Yale - Harvard football game , NYC Scavenger hunt , canoeing , Laser Tag , drive-in movies , trips to a Halloween theme parks , to the local fire station , St. Patrick 's Day Parade , and the all-time favorite - our annual Karaoke night ! <p> It is a pleasure to be able to guide our au pairs through what most of them refer to as their best year of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ return to their home country and to hear about how this year abroad has enriched them in more ways than imaginable . <h> Katrina , LCC in Massachusetts <p> In her words , when it comes to an au pair year , the more you are prepared to give , the more you will get back. - Katrina is a mother of teenagers and has hosted au pairs in her own home ; for sixteen years and counting she gives terrific support to her au pairs before , during and after their program year . <p> I am one of the many women and men across the country that will be your local support person .

@@41904410 @1904410/ <h> Host Family Poll : How to welcome a new au pair <p> June 20 , 2014 <p> Welcoming an au pair and bringing a new person into your home is a big change for everyone involved . It is important to take the time to prepare both your home and your family for your new arrival . Our recent Cultural Care Au Pair parent poll asked our panel , " How do you prepare to welcome your au pair ? " <p> Communicate before the new au pair arrives Some parents feel that regular communication between the au pair and the kids once the match is finalized is important . " I have my new au pair Skype with my kids every week once before we match so they can all meet each other , and then every week afterward . One of my kids connects so well with the current au pair that he wont even talk to the new au pair , but he will send little icons and sentences via chat . This made a huge difference with my latest match . We had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave the kids a lot of time to get to know him . We talked often about the au pair and what he had in common with the kids , and how he was different . I also encourage my kids ( who are all school aged ) to email the au pair directly with their questions and to share their adventures , and I ask the au pair to be sure to email back . " <p> Prepare to say good bye to your current au pair One veteran host father said it was important for the kids to understand what their current au pair will be doing after she leaves their family . " We 've had 8 au pairs so far , so in advance we talk to our children about our current au pair and where she is going and what she is going to do when she gets home and we talk about the new girl who is coming .

" <p> Help the kids get to know the new au pair What is the best way for children to get to know their au pair before she arrives ? " We check out library books about the country the au pair is coming from about six weeks before she arrives . We also Skype with her several times with the kids before she arrives so they can start building a relationship . " One host mother said , " I tell them about what I know about her her likes and dislikes , things she has done , etc . I am really excited when I talk to them about her so they get excited , too . We make a sign , get balloons , and all go together to get her at the airport . " <p> Get the au pairs room ready Families had a number of suggestions for preparing the au pairs bedroom for her arrival . One family said , " We buy presents for the au pairs room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , etc. and the kids make welcome cards . " Another family added , " Each year we add something new and unique specific to that au pair . " Cultural Care provides the address of the Au Pair Training School so families can send a gift to their au pair there if they choose . A family who does this told us , " They usually help to prepare the au pairs room and help to shop for gift baskets , one that will be in her room upon arrival and on that shell get when she arrives in New York . They color a picture to put in a basket that we send to the training school . " <p> Make arrival day special After greeting your au pair at the airport or bus stop , its time to introduce her to your home and community . " The day she arrives we let our kids give her a tour of our home , showing her all of their favorite things . We are also home for a week with the au pair before leaving her with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , take trips around the area to let our kids teach her where things are in our town , have our kids show her how to play their favorite games , and show her all of the things they like to do .

During that year I realized that a local childcare consultant can make all the difference in the lives of an au pair . I promised myself that if I ever ended up in the U.S. that I would find a way to help young international adults .

Finding " Thank You " notes in my mailbox or a favorite box of chocolates from an au pair outside my door has made me smile on many occasions and confirmed that I am in the right place . It is such joy when a host family compliments me on how happy they are to have me as their sounding board as they explore the program . I have even had a few flower deliveries to my door after helping families navigate very challenging situations with their au pairs .

I use my compensation to pay for my children 's education and household bills . <p> If you could pick one word to describe what it 's like to be an LCC what would it be ? How about two words ? !
