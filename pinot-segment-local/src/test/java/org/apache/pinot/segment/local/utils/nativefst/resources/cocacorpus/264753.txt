" Players do have to stand out and find ways to get noticed and realize it is not always about them only . We value players that play a team game and have a true love for the game .

@@75571804 @4271804/ <p> Through the years , the North American Hockey League ( NAHL ) has built up a reputation of being one of the best junior hockey leagues in America . <p> Rivaling the likes of the United States Hockey Leagues ( USHL ) , the NAHL has been developing some of the most interesting , raw talent hoping to one day make it to the NHL . One area where they 've excelled is between the pipes . The NAHL has seen four of their goalies drafted by NHL teams over the last three years and there 's no denying the fact that Anthony Stolarz , Connor Hellebuyck , Evan Cowley , and Chase Perry each have an abundant amount of upside and potential . <p> While Stolarz , Hellebuyck , Cowley , and Perry were all selected in the previous three NHL Entry Drafts , the NAHLs up-and-coming goalies are being featured more and more with the publishing of every passing CSS midterm and final rankings . That trend has n't  slowed down whatsoever in 2015 . With only two NAHL netminders on last years CSS midterm rankings and three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the NAHL has been putting in a tremendous amount of work into raising its goalies standing . Five of their armored gladiators appear in CSSs top 21 midterm-ranked North American goalies . <p> Of course , not all of the NAHL goalies listed in Central Scoutings midterm and final rankings will be selected come draft day as Kasimir Kaskisuo and Logan Halladay unfortunately experienced last year but the junior hockey league has certainly set their youngsters up for future success even if they do n't  have the honor of being drafted by an NHL team . Although its hard to forecast which goalies from which league will be taken on draft day , there 's no denying the fact that the NAHL has been vaulting itself up the rankings over the last few years with its diligent developmental process for goalies and the proof is definitely in the pudding . <p> Matej Tomek ( Topeka RoadRunners ) <p> Last year , Kasimir Kaskisuo made the jump from the Finnish developmental leagues straight to North American hockey in the NAHL and his transition was seamless as he posted tremendous numbers ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Percentage ) in his first taste of overseas play with the Minnesota Wilderness . Much in the same light , Matej Tomek has seized a similar opportunity with the Topeka RoadRunners this season after coming over from Slovakia . Playing a combined total of only 41 games between the Slovakia U18 and U20 teams from 2012-2014 , Tomek has posted some of the best numbers of his career while playing in 33 NAHL games this season . Listed at 6 ' 2 ? and 180 lbs. , Tomek has compiled a 24-7-2 record so far this season and has some pretty impressive peripheral totals ( 1.83 GAA , .928 Save Percentage ) to go along with his W-L record . With Kyle Woodlief believing that Tomek could rival the number one ranked goalie ( Mackenzie Blackwood ) on CSSs list come draft day , it has been plain to see that Tomek has the requisite talent to be a high draft pick in Florida this summer . Key amongst all of this has been the NAHL , which has given the young Slovakian goalie an arena to showcase his skills @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ play . Slated to play for the University of North Dakota next season , Tomek will continue his development in the states and will undoubtedly be the NAHLs most highly-regarded prospect in Sunrise , Florida in late June . <p> Ryan Bednard ( Johnstown Tomahawks ) <p> Ranked number 15 overall on CSSs midterm list of draft-eligible North American goalies , Ryan Bednard is the second of five NAHL netminders on the scouting list . So far this season , Bednard has appeared in 37 games for the Johnstown Tomahawks and has compiled a 16-16-5 record while playing to the tune of a 2.66 GAA and .913 Save Percentage . Although Bednards numbers might not drop many jaws , his selection to play in this years CCM/USA Hockey All-American Prospects game for Team Grier spoke for itself . Of course , Bednards draft stock could have been further aided if Johnstown was n't a sub-.500 team in their division , but the goalies consistent level of play this season has not only been a testament to his development in the NAHL , it has spoken volumes of his mental composition and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bowling Green State University next season , Bednard will provide the university with a big body ( 6 ' 3 ? , 179 lbs. ) in net once Tomas Sholl ( another NAHL graduate ) graduates . Bednard compliments his size with good athleticism and will have every chance to grow in the Bowling State program , but he will have to finish off the NAHL season in strong fashion to maintain his positioning in CSSs final rankings . Whether or not Bednard will be drafted this summer is anyones best guess , but the fact that yet another NAHL goalie has been ranked so high in what is considered to be a stocked draft class is evidence enough of the leagues dedication toward quality goaltending work . <p> Jens " Vaughan " Ahrens ( Minnesota Magicians ) <p> Much like Ryan Bednard , Jens " Vaughan " Ahrens has played on a team that has n't  had the best of showings during the 14-15 NAHL season . Despite the fact that the Minnesota Magicians clinched a playoff spot this season , their 21-35-4 record and 46 points is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Even though the Magicians havent had a good record this season , Ahrens has n't  let that stand in his way of his growth . Playing in 29 games so far this season , Ahrens has posted a 3.43 GAA and .905 Save Percentage and while some may not think much of the aforementioned numbers , fans must also remember that Anthony Stolarz ( Philadelphia Flyers ) did n't  have the best peripheral statistics when he was drafted . Though Ahrens ( 6 ' 2 ? , 194 lbs. ) does n't  possess the same size that made Stolarz such an interesting project , he has shown a good amount of composure playing on a sub-.500 team something that has earned the praise of head coach Tom Upton , as the bench boss stated ; " Vaughan was great this weekend and since his return from injury , you can see him getting better by the week . He is an elite goalie and that is why he continues to be someone we will rely on for team success moving forward , " Having made the tenth most saves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four less games than any other goalie in the top 10 in the aforementioned stat category Ahrens has seen a consistent amount of shots this season and would have seen more if not for an injury . Ranked 19th overall on CSSs midterm list , Ahrens has been powering the Magicians with his play and could very well see a bump in CSSs final rankings with a solid finish to the regular season and playoffs . <p> Evan Smith ( Austin Bruins ) <p> Unlike Bednard and Ahrens , Evan Smith has played for one of the top three teams in the NAHL this season , and that has definitely helped him get some added exposure . Standing at least 6 ' 6 ? , Smith is a pretty hard target to miss as he is by far the tallest of the five goalies on CSSs midterm rankings . Off of pure height , Smith can instantly draw comparisons to Anthony Stolarz , but he will have to have a strong performance in the playoffs in order to improve his draft stock . Splitting time between the WHL ( 4 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Smith has compiled a 12-1-2 record with a 1.73 GAA and .923 save percentage for Austin during the regular season , so the playoffs will give an additional measuring stick for a goalie with a relatively small sample size . At 174 lbs. , Smith will need to fill out his frame a bit more , but that will come naturally over the next couple of years as he continues maturing . Considering his height , Smith already has assets that many NHL teams will covet when draft day rolls around . However , it will be up to the goalie ( 18th overall on CSS midterm rankings ) to show that his regular season performance was n't just a one-off as the postseason will surely demand a more challenging level of play for a goalie on a top-three team with high expectations . <p> Matthew Jurusik ( Janesville Jets ) <p> Matthew Jurusik has recorded the best statistics out of the five NAHL netminders on CSSs list , yet he is the lowest ranked netminder ( 21 ) of the group . Being the smallest ( 6 ' 0 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have height on his side , but if the Jets go far in the playoffs he could definitely increase his value for draft day . Playing in 40 of Janesvilles games , Jurusik had a 33-5-0 record with a 1.57 GAA and .939 Save Percentage numbers that were well above those of CSSs number four ranked North American goaltender and fellow NAHLer , Matej Tomek .

Nichols , 19 , posted a 5-1-1 record in seven games played during the month . Nichols ( 511/180 ) also posted three shutouts during the month and stopped 131 of a possible 139 shots , which was good for a 94.2% save percentage and a goals against average of just 1.12 . <p> " I think the backbone to any good team defense is your goaltending , " said Wenatchee head coach John Becanic . " We are fortunate to have two good ones here in Wenatchee and Rob has put together a season that will be remembered for a long time . He simply wants to win and that shows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gotten better as the season has gone along . " <p> Nichols posted three shutouts in a span of five starts . He posted shutouts in back-to-back starts in Dawson Creek back on March 8th and 10th earning him the NAHLs #2 star that week . He then posted a shutout in his final regular season start back on March 30th , a 6-0 win over the Fresno Monsters . Those three shutouts helped Nichols set a new NAHL record for shutouts in a season with 10 . Nichols also posted the lowest goals against average in the 36-year history of the league with a 1.49 GAA . <p> " I think it first starts with the team . Everyone buys into a concept and a plan to make us successful defensively , " said Nichols .

I think it is a great honor to be a part of something historical like that . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and has only had two games all season long in which he allowed four or more goals . It is a big reason why Nichols led the NAHL in both goals against average ( 1.49 ) and save percentage ( 93.8% ) this season . Of Nichols 24 wins this season , 10 have been shutouts and despite splitting time this season with fellow Wild goaltender Greg Lewis ( who won Octobers NAHL goalie of the month ) , Nichols has managed to post an impressive 24-6-4 record this season . <p> Becanic believes that Nichols biggest improvement this season has been his ability to read the game . " You want your goalies to make all the saves , but you also want them to read what is going to happen and predict it so that the saves they are making become more routine . Rob has made his share of big saves this season , but he has put up the numbers he has because he has made it easier on himself to make those saves and not feel pressure all the time . " <p> Nichols agrees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the NAHL . " I think it is important to understand the technical side of the game , so that you are maximizing the work you put in . You do n't  always want to be scrambling to make the saves .

In 2004-05 and again in 2007-08 , he was honored as the NAHL Coach of the Year . <p> In his first three seasons in Texarkana , Coopers teams got better each season . By the time the franchise has moved to St. Louis in 2006-07 , Cooper had developed the Bandits into a Robertson Cup contender .

" <p> Coopers roots and meteoric rise in coaching flourished in the NAHL , as Stu Hackel recounted in a Sports Illustrated article <p> At the time Cooper broke into the league , the Texarkana Bandits played in the arena on the Four States Fairgrounds , a big , metal-sided building with a tin roof that was never intended for hockey . " Barn " is a word that hockey people have long used as slang for their rinks , but this place was far more barn than rink .

" Getting a Suburban , hooking up a trailer , loading the equipment and driving 120 miles one way to practice in Little Rock because that was the closest ice available .

But the unmistakable overall impression Cooper left and still leaves is how much he truly loves hockey and working to get the most out of players . <p> The Texarkana experience taught him a great deal about perseverance and handling adversity , and when the team 's ownership -- which included former St. Louis Blues tough guy Kelly Chase and St. Louis-area businessman Mike Brooks -- moved the Bandits to a modern rink in suburban St. Louis for the 2005-06 campaign , Cooper was glad to have paid those dues . <p> " It was no surprise we won two straight Robertson Cup championships when we went to St. Louis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ won one or two in Texarkana .

" <p> Earlier this week , six NAHL players were listed on the NHL Central Scouting Players to Watch list and there have already been a number of NCAA commitments for the 2012-13 season . That commitment number is certain to skyrocket based upon the players performance and the interest shown by scouts at the NAHL Showcase . It comes on the heels of a season which was a record-breaking year for NCAA commitments for players in the NAHL . Over 190 players that played in the NAHL this past season or were an alumni of the NAHL from last season , committed to an NCAA school . <p> All 24 NAHL teams played four regular-season games at the tournament , which was highlighted by three teams ( Texas Tornado , Kalamazoo Jr .

In total , 80 teams were in action over a five-day span . <p> The most eye-popping number from the event was that a record 324 scouts who attended the Showcase during the five days , shattering the previous high number set last season of 253. 55 NHL scouts attended , which included all but one NHL team and also included members of NHL Central Scouting , a department within the NHL that ranks prospects for the NHL Entry Draft . <p> Having previously attended the NAHL Showcase as a scout @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now works for NHL Central Scouting , was at the event and said that this years NAHL Showcase met every expectation .

" I think for goalies in particular , it is a numbers game , " said Rajanen . " There are only so many spots available at the Junior A levels , but there has always been a lot of buzz surrounding goalies in this league . " <p> The largest representation of scouts came from the NCAA. 153 NCAA scouts were in attendance during the five-day event , including 84 NCAA Division I scouts . Out of the current 59 NCAA Division I programs , all but two were represented at the NAHL Showcase . <p> One of the NCAA Division I teams that have tapped directly into the NAHL pipeline is the Air Force Academy Falcons of the Atlantic Hockey Association ( AHA ) . This past season , head coach Frank Serratore had 19 NAHL alumni on his roster . Serratore said he was impressed with the 2012 NAHL Showcase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of teams . " This years Showcase had the best parity I have seen in years . The expansion teams have caught up and there are no bad teams or bad games . I think the league is deeper from top to bottom than it has ever been , and the gap has narrowed considerably between teams , which make the games fun to watch and is a real positive for the league this season . " With 29 of the 30 NHL teams and 57 of the 59 NCAA Division I teams in attendance , Serratore believes that the NAHL Showcase has to be an annual , mandatory event for any scout . " I think if you are not at the NAHL Showcase as a scout or a coach , you have to ask yourselfare you doing your job ? This is a must-see event for our staff every season because from our perspective you cant leave any stone unturned and the NAHL has a great track record and history producing some very good NCAA talent each season .

They come to us as mature adults , they have n't been pampered , they come in with a great work ethic and they are humble , " said Serratore . They want to get to continue to learn and become better hockey players at the NCAA level and they are appreciative of what we provide . Everyone has to have a primary recruiting ground , or go to league , and for us that league is the NAHL . " <p> Another one of the NCAA Division I scouts in attendance was Gary Shuchuk , an Assistant Coach at the University of Wisconsin of the Western Collegiate Hockey Association ( WCHA ) . " The fact you are able to see so many different levels of hockey and players , makes the NAHL Showcase probably the biggest recruiting event we attend , " said Shuchuk . " It is amazing and is literally one-stop shopping for everyone here . Players and teams are represented from all over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ players , identify those that may be a fit for your program and then follow them through the season . " <p> " I think there is a lot of talent in the NAHL . It is a little bit of an older and more grittier league , but you are going to find players in this league that are college ready , experienced and know what it takes to win , " said Shuchuk . " All players develop at their own pace , some earlier and some later . I like players in the NAHL because they have a strong work ethic and carry a little bit of an edge and a chip on their shoulder . Just because two players are n't  equal in talent at age 16 , does n't  mean they wont be by the time they are ready to play college hockey . The reality is that in todays NCAA , teams are n't  just looking to fill the voids left by seniors because players may leave early , they go the NHL , they transfer , etc so besides looking for the guys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ graduated , we have to be prepared to fill all the voids . We also cant limit ourselves to just players who are college ready , but we have to prepare two , three , four years down the road and that 's where the younger players at an event like this factor into it . " <p> Finally , an event like the NAHL Showcase would not be possible if it werent for the Schwan Super Rink , the largest facility of its kind in the world . From its eight sheets of ice to its experienced staff , no other building matches what the Schwan Super Rink delivers . " For five days in a row , we run games from morning till night and their staff is there and helping every step of the way , " said Frankenfeld . " It is not only a testament to the facility , but to the staff and their professionalism , management and accommodations for the thousands of fans and players that attend on an annual basis .

At 52-18-1-2 ( 107 points ) , the Admirals have won their first division title since 2003 and have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the first time ever . <p> Norfolk , whose top five scorers this season include three rookies and one second-year pro , leads the AHL in offense ( 3.58 goals per game ) and ranks third in defense ( 2.40 goals against per game ) , and under Coopers development watch nine Admirals were called up to play a total of 142 games with the parent Tampa Bay Lightning in the National Hockey League this season . <p> A 44-year-old native of Prince George , B.C. , Cooper joined the Tampa Bay Lightning organization in August 2010 as head coach of their top development affiliate in Norfolk following a prolific career in the U.S. junior ranks . Cooper was a head coach in the CSHL ( now the 3HL ) for the Metro Jets prior to working in the NAHL from 2003-08 for the Texarkana/St . Louis Bandits franchise . <p> While in St. Louis , Cooper led the Bandits to back-to-back Robertson Cup championships in 2007 and 2008 .

He won a USHL championship and was that leagues coach of the year with Green Bay in 2010 . <p> Cooper has also spent time behind the bench internationally for Team USAs U-17 and U-18 teams . A dual citizen of the United States and Canada , Cooper played hockey and lacrosse at Hofstra University and later obtained a law degree from the Thomas M. Cooley Law School . <p> NAHL.com recently had the chance to sit down and catch up with Cooper to discuss several topics including : being named the AHLs most outstanding coach , his teams current 25-game winning streak , his time spent in the NAHL and his desire to coach in the NHL in the future . <p> NAHL.com : Jon , at every level you have been at the last 10 years , including the NAHL , you have somehow managed to be coach of the year in each of the leagues . What does that personally mean to you to have been recognized like that ? <p> Cooper : Its the ultimate team award because when your team has success awards will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is in pro . In junior , a head coach really dictates everything scouting , player personnel , coaches , general management , strategy on the ice , development , etc . I think success in professional hockey is much more of a testament in a management team that believes in you . You do n't  have a lot of say with what kind of players you are getting because other people are making those decisions . However , you have to have the ability to work with the players along with the management to share a philosophy that is going to make your team a success on the ice . Everyone in the Tampa Bay and Norfolk organizations has placed a lot of faith and belief in me , which gives everyone involved the confidence that we are doing things right here and heading in the right direction . The other thing is , the award is voted on by your peers , so its really rewarding to know that the other guys in your business think enough about what you are doing to honor you with something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Is it a neat experience to see some of the guys that played for you and against you in the NAHL , now doing the same in the AHL ? <p> Cooper : For sure . The one thing it makes me remember is how young , raw and eager the players are at the junior level . When they get to the professional level they are men and expected to do a job . Physical maturity is one of the drastic changes you notice right away in the professional game . I also remember the guys that worked really , really hard in junior to separate themselves from the pack are now the guys that are playing in leagues like the AHL . I remember guys like Jeff Dimmen , who played three years in the NAHL , spent some time playing for me in St. Louis and is now playing for me in Norfolk . Those type of players did n't  cheat the system while they were playing junior hockey and it is the main reason that players like that are able to make it to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advice I can offer up to guys playing junior right now is do n't  take the shortcut and work hard . <p> NAHL.com : Do you have any philosophies or methods that you used while coaching in the NAHL that still remain in use and are relevant today in the AHL with Norfolk ? <p> Cooper : Yes . I have always tried to surround myself with good people . That is the one steadfast thing in any organization that I have gone to was always to surround myself with people that put me in a position to be successful . It does n't  guarantee success , but looking back on my time spent at all the levels of hockey , I was surrounded by great people . Whether it was the ownership groups , the management or the staff , I have been very fortunate to work for and be surrounded by unreal people . <p> NAHL.com : Your current win streak with Norfolk is at 25 games , which is not only an AHL record , but the longest streak for any active professional league in North American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the streak and what the Admirals have been able to accomplish during that time ? <p> Cooper : I remember in mid-February we had a team meeting after losing three out of four games during a certain stretch . Then I remember the next stretch of games being six games in the next eight nights , all the while wondering how we were going to hold up and get through it . It turned out that the final game of that six game stretch in which we started the winning streak was our only OT/shootout win during the current winning streak of 25 games . Once we won that game and gutted it out , the guys really had a lot of confidence and momentum . It was that six-game winning streak in eight nights that really started the balling rolling . <p> NAHL.com : When you go in the lockerroom before your games now , what do you say as a coach to a team that has won 25 games in a row ? <p> Cooper : Well , you do n't  have to say much . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own and has become bigger than anything I could have imagined . The one thing it has done is forced our players to understand and appreciate the moment . I think when we get into certain situations when our backs are against the wall and the game is close , our guys have responded each and every time . They know what is at stake , so when I look around the room and see the motivation , I just try and get out of the way . They have a heightened awareness , urgency and passion to make sure they keep winning and keep this thing going . We are getting everyones best shot and have the self-inflicted bulls-eye on our chests , but we have a great group of players and they keep finding a way to win . <p> NAHL.com : Is your ultimate goal to be coaching in the NHL one day ? <p> Cooper : I will tell you , if you would have asked me while I was coaching in the NAHL if I would have gone somewhere else besides St. Louis to coach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happened in Green Bay I thought I was going to stay there for a while . However , I am really enjoying being in Norfolk and in the AHL right now . It goes back to what I alluded to earlier about surrounding yourself with the right people . This whole journey has never been about an NHL or bust mentality . I am elated to be with the Tampa Bay organization and what we have been able to do with their AHL affiliate in Norfolk . I couldnt be happier with the decision I made to decide to coach at the pro level and in the AHL . Now that I am in the AHL , there is a lot to do and still a lot of learning to do on my part . If I was fortunate enough where a situation did open up in the NHL , I would look hard at it because this is the path I have chosen and when I am in that type of environment I would like to get to the top .

The Elkins family is recently newer billet parents who had their first yearlong player , Tobias Kircher , last season . <p> After the player ventured home on Sunday morning , Patty noticed something he had left behind in the spare bedroom . <p> " It was just laying on the bed pillow after he made up the room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a yellow card with " THANK YOU " written in big , colorful letters and font . In the card were a $50 bill and a handwritten note . It said : <p> " Elkins Family , <p> Thank you so much for letting me stay with you this past week . It really means a lot to me that you allowed me to chase my dreams by staying at your house . Its because of families like you that allow kids like me to succeed in hockey . I had an amazing time this week and hope to be back soon and maybe be able to play . <p> Thanks , <p> Justin Meers <p> Go IceRays !

The experience is twofold , both as a way to learn how to improve but also a taste of the North American Hockey League ( NAHL ) lifestyle . <p> With that comes an introduction to new people , new places , and a new home , and Meers is undoubtedly grateful for the last portion . <p> " They gave me a room to stay and helped me chase my dream of playing in the league , " said Meers . " You cant really ask a stranger to do that . They wo n't always offer their house to someone they do n't  know . That alone was enough .

The relationship grows to a point where players become one of the children , and the billet families become an extension of the athletes own family members . Transitioning to a new home can be difficult for anyone from ages 17 to 20 , but the generosity displayed by families like the Elkins goes a long way to making the junior hockey experience easier and more enjoyable . <p> Meers admits the tentativeness on his part during his first couple days that soon disappeared . <p> " At first , it was a little weird because I was in a strangers home , " said Meers . " You do n't  know each other at all . But they were really welcoming and made me feel part of the family . It was easy to adjust to .

It was just something I thought she would like . " <p> Among the impressed in the IceRays organization was Head Coach Brad Flynn , who saw his actions with the team on the ice throughout the week but now sees a different side to the recruit . <p> " Justin is an example of the type of player we look for and what we want on the IceRays , " said IceRays Head Coach Brad Flynn , who worked with Justin during his weeklong stay .

For Meers , the feeling is mutual . <p> " I 'd be happy to go back and stay there . They really did a lot for me , and they made me feel like part of the family . "

It has been updated to reflect the final and record-breaking commitment numbers from the 2015-16 season . <p> As the calendar turns to August , the North American Hockey League ( NAHL ) now resets its NCAA commitments for the upcoming 2016-17 season , which will be the 41st season of NAHL hockey . <p> Back on June 24th , the NAHL announced that it had set a new single-season record for NCAA commitments in one calendar year . Over the course of the summer , that total has steadily increased and the league is now please to announce it record-breaking final totals for the 2015-16 season . <p> During the 2015-16 season , the league had a final total of 253 NCAA commitments . Another astonishing fact was that the NAHL set the record with only 22 teams during the 2015-16 season . <p> Of the 253 NCAA commitments , 177 ( 70% ) of those were to NCAA Division I schools , while 74 were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Interuniversity Sport ( CIS ) schools . Of the 253 NAHL players making NCAA commitments , 28 of those are NAHL alumni who played in the league prior to this season . <p> 2015-16 College Commmitments <p> NCAA Division I : 177 <p> NCAA Division III : 74 <p> CIS : 2 <p> TOTAL : 253 <p> The numbers again do n't  lie . No other junior league in the world saw as many NCAA commitments for their players , while they were actually playing in the league . The NAHL finished second only to the United States Hockey League ( USHL ) in total NCAA commitments this past season . <p> " First and foremost , this is about the players and the quality of hockey currently being played in the NAHL , " said NAHL Commissioner Mark Frankenfeld . " Players are being educated and trained at a higher level , which creates a much greater level of competition across the board . Their development is at an all-time high . The amount of work that goes into player development , which not only includes the on-ice component @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and nutrition , is a big reason why this accomplishment is possible . " <p> With 22 teams and 253 NCAA commitments , each team averaged 11 and a half commitments this past season . One of those teams who has had a recent run of success is the Janesville Jets . Their 16 commitments this season , which includes 12 players who played during the 2015-16 season , was one of the leaders in the league . Janesville Jets Owner and Governor Bill McCoshen , who is also the NAHL Chairman of the Board , echoed Frankenfelds sentiment about player development . <p> " Player advancement has become and continues to be the top priority of all of our member teams . I think everyone would like to win the Robertson Cup , but having a good number of NCAA commitments each season is something that we highlight and focus on as owners , " said McCoshen . " It is one of the primary conversations of every meeting we have . We continue to ask ourselves as owners , how can we keep increasing the opportunity for our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> Frankenfeld said that thanks in large part to the owners in the NAHL , the league has been able to enjoy some steady years of consistency and growth . " Our NAHL owners have continued to invest into their product and teams , which includes their coaches , their staff , their accommodations for the players , their arenas and their fans , " continued Frankenfeld . " The brand equity of being in the NAHL and operating a team has never been this high or this valuable . There is a lot of momentum because of more consistency among the ownership and teams . " <p> One of the big success stories this season was the commitments from the teams in the new East Division , which will be expanding to five teams in 2016-17 with the addition of the Northeast Generals . Between the four East Division teams this season ( Aston Rebels , Johnstown Tomhawks , New Jersey Titans and Wilkes-Barre/Scranton Knights ) there were 51 NCAA commitments alone . <p> The Aston Rebels , who won both the East Division regular season and playoff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Joe Coombs said that the credit is largely to the talent level of both the players and coaches . " I firmly believe that the coaches in our league are some the best young coaches in the country and the quality of player in the league is getting better each season . The ability for us as coaches to communicate with todays players has taken a big step forward . The talent level is better than even just a few years ago , " said Coombs . <p> Coombs continued " What 's important to our organization and probably any NAHL team out there is helping these players grow into more mature men . There is a process and culture that is one of growing and bringing an effort at getting better each day . We believe that if we can follow our process and believe in the positivity of our environment , that the winning will follow , " said Coombs . " Its a deliberate and well thought out process . The sustainability of our league reflects directly back on the leadership of our teams . The NAHL allows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ build the foundations we see today . " <p> The NAHL Coach of the Year , John LaFontaine , guided his Wichita Falls Wildcats to the South Division regular season and playoff titles , as well as , an appearance in the Robertson Cup Championship Game . Not only did LaFontaine enjoy a season of success for his players , but it also led to his promotion as being named the new head coach of the Muskegon Lumberjacks in the USHL on July 13th . <p> LaFontaines coaching background in the league dates all the way back to 2004 when he was with the Bozeman Icedogs . LaFontaine believes that because the league has put a priority on advancing their players , it has made great strides in recent years . <p> " The league has made development , exposure and promotion the highest priority for NAHL players and teams . From writing stories on an individual player basis or promoting stories written by each team 's local media , the league office has done a remarkable job of making our players the focus and marketing them the right way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grow . This momentum has allowed the strong branding of the NAHL into the Tier III junior , as well as , the 18U and 16U levels as well in a well-established ladder of development . " <p> Another big piece of the puzzle for the league is the popularity of the league-wide events , which include the NAHL Showcase , the NAHL Top Prospects Tournament and the NAHL Robertson Cup Championship , which all annually see hundreds of NCAA and NHL scouts at each event during the season . Over half the NCAA commitments made this season came following the NAHL Top Prospects Tournament held in Plymouth , Michigan in late February . <p> " It is very significant that half the commitments come after our Top Prospects event , which goes back to and is a testament of our model . The NAHL Showcase , which has literally become the Greatest Show on Ice , sets everyone up on the grandest stage for an initial evaluation in September . Scouts can see how players develop , make an assessment throughout the season and then follow up with that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the core root of our success , " said Frankenfeld . <p> For only the second time in league history , the Robertson Cup was hosted and run by the NAHL , diverting from the formats in the past , which included a play down , as well as , a team-hosted event similar to the Memorial Cup format , which had a run in the NAHL from 2004-12 . Over 100 NCAA and NHL scouts attended this years Robertson Cup in Edina , Minnesota in the middle of May , which added another positive piece to the NAHLs event component . <p> " Adding the Robertson Cup to our list of events just further reinforced that philosophy , " said Frankenfeld . " While there are only four teams , those teams are playing at a very high level and the scouts not only get another opportunity for evaluation , but also see a player compete when pressure is at its peak . The scouts are getting a look at a player who has evolved , matured and excelled throughout the season . Our events are all taking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same location and I think that consistency has benefitted the scouts the most . " <p> McCoshen agreed with the event set up and its effectiveness . " The NAHL puts on fantastic major scouting events such as the NAHL Showcase , the Top Prospects Tournament and the Robertson Cup Final Four to promote our players . These events are all strategically timed and conveniently located for maximum scouting benefit . " <p> " I have been impressed with the professionalism and attention to detail that our league office has given to our NAHL Showcase , Top Prospects Tournament , Robertson Cup and Annual Coaches Meetings . It makes you proud to be part of this league , " stated LaFontaine . <p> Lastly , the NAHL may be seeing an annual increase in commitment numbers because of its ability to cater to all types of players . In recent years , the league has trended towards adding more younger players to the mix of older , more developed players . The average age of an NAHL player at the start of the season was right around 18 + years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approach that works for all types of players . On the one hand , an older player who develops later in his junior career may pose less of a risk for NCAA teams . They are getting a more mature player , who has been through a season or two of junior hockey and all that it involves , whether that be being away from home , the travel , the competition , the exposure and playing on the road in environments you just cant replicate until you have actually done it , " said Frankenfeld . " At the same time , the NAHL is a more attractive league to play in and attracting the younger players as well because we are keeping our players safe and have placed a premium focus in recent years on player safety . Guys can play faster and harder with the knowledge that we are doing everything we can to keep them safe , which includes our exclusive Department of Player Safety , and keep the focus on skill development . " <p> " I agree that the league has gotten a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something to prove and are very hungry for that opportunity to play a high level of junior hockey . This in turn , this pushes the older players because there are only 23 roster spots , " said Coombs . " Yes , it takes time for the younger players to garner experience , but by Christmas they are up to speed . The colleges are recruiting both the younger player for the future and the older player for more immediate need . What we are seeing is inquiries and interest on both types , so as a coach it is important to have a balance of both younger and older players . " <p> McCoshen agrees that one of the big reasons for the rise in commitments each season is because the league is trending younger . " I think there is significant evidence to support the increase in NCAA commitments , especially Division I commitments , is directly related to the league accepting and developing younger talent . They are showing these scouts that they not only are good hockey players , but can also handle the rigors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are , " stated McCoshen . <p> So , when considering what league may be best for the junior-bound hockey player , consider the sheer evidence that the NAHL continues to prove : A record-breaking season resulting in 253 NCAA commitments and still rising . It also includes committed ownership that is providing players top quality coaching , skill development and community-supported teams in stable markets , and one-of-a-kind events that provide unparalleled exposure with the continued support from the NCAA coaches themselves , who continue to support the numbers that when it comes to earning an NCAA commitment while playing junior hockey , no one does it better than the NAHL . <p> " Heading into our 41st season , the NAHL is in the best position it has ever been in both on and off the ice . That 's a credit to strong leadership from our Commissioner Mark Frankenfeld , our tireless and extremely talented staff and to our Executive Committee and Board of Governors that plans for the future and executes to succeed , " concluded McCoshen.

The native of Arvada , Colorado , played in six of the eight games during the month and recorded 13 points ( 3 goals , 10 assists ) . Poulsen ( 57/150 ) , who is committed to play NCAA Division I hockey for the University of Alabama-Huntsville in the WCHA next season , registered a point in five of his six games during the month and was also a +3 .

He has worked hard to get to the point where is he now and all of the recent success with the appearance in Top Prospects and the NCAA commitment is a result of his dedication to himself and his team , " said Wings head coach Travis Winter . " There is a reason Jake is our captain and he will be an impact player at the next level of hockey in the NCAA .

As a result , I was able to secure that NCAA Division I commitment that has been my dream since arriving in the NAHL , but I do n't  want to let up . I want to get better and I know we have a team that has the capability of accomplishing a lot and hopefully earn the opportunity to play for the Robertson Cup .

You do n't  have a guy for four years like in college hockey , so the turnover rate and rate at which you are searching for new players is pretty high . Any year you come to a tryout camp , it could vary in the positions that are available and what we may be looking for , so that 's why camps are so valuable . It is a reality that sometimes there are veteran guys , tenders and draft picks who do n't  make the team because we have had a particularly good tryout camp . We are trying to build the best roster we can . We want a mix of skilled guys , role players and guys who simply want to win . You never know , you could come and have a great weekend at a tryout camp and the next thing you know , you are playing in the NAHL .

Every part of the country has an established program and players that can play at our level . I think it is impossible for any team in the NAHL to scout and get a look at every prospect during the season and inevitably some will get missed or overlooked , which is why tryout camps are such an important piece of the puzzle . We have to have tryout camps because of the growth of the game , the amount of players out there and to make sure that we do n't  leave any stone unturned when it comes to finding players that can play at this level . " Trevor Stewart , Head Coach , Fairbanks Ice Dogs : " We had eight players that made our team from tryout @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Robertson Cup Tournament this past season . What we are finding out from year to year from our tryout camps is that there may be players that come there and some may perform better than those we have tendered or drafted , so it makes the roster decisions very difficult . Ultimately , that type of competition and parity is exactly what you want to see because it makes us a better team , making tryout camps an extremely important part of the roster selection process . " <p> Jason Spence , Head Coach , Johnstown Tomahawks : " As a new team in a new NAHL market , we wanted to get our name out there , so holding tryout camps in different regions of the country is key because you get a look at different players , with different styles from different areas .

At a tryout camp , you know exactly who is watching and why you are there and players may respond differently to that . I tell the players on Day 1 of tryout camp before they step on the ice that they are there to do their specific job and showcase what they feel they can do best . Do n't  try to go out there and do someone elses job . I want to see what type of players they are because that may be the right fit at the right time . I cant take 30 of the same type of player . You find out real quick at a tryout camp who is for real and who is not , because with the amount of eyes watching them they cant take a shift off . I like the tryout process as a whole because not only do you get to see what type of skills and player has but it tells you a lot about his personality on and off the ice .

It is one of , if not the most important way we evaluate and obtain players who not only are ready to play in the NAHL , but who can take advantage of the 2-3 day opportunity when we are watching them . We like to keep our camps smaller , so we have more opportunity to really evaluate and watch the players . I know a lot of teams are placing an importance of strategically placing the camps across the country , so they provide as many chances as possible for players to get a shot and trying out for an NAHL team because you never know . Our goalie this past season , Anthony Stolarz , is a perfect example . We noticed him at a tryout in New York and the rest became history . Almost half our team last season came out of our main tryout camp .

The 2013-14 is underway and players have now had a couple of months to start and grow their hockey flow .

Obviously , the hockey fans out there have spoken , so the NAHL and Gongshow had to listen . <p> Skoog starts his tangled greatness with a simple style up top , which requires the simple combination of some styling glue/gel and his fingers , which allows the hair on top to be slicked back .

One of the main reasons the hair has to be this way is so the goalie mask fits comfortably over the head . <p> But then comes the prized ending to Skoogs manly mane , and that is the back . Clearly there is a party back there and everyone was invited . Picture a broom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order to sweep up any mess that is exactly what Skoogs hair does in the back . It feathers out and provides a nest of goodness at the end of it that is unrivaled . <p> As for our two fans these two beauties ( Alex and Rhett ) were captured at the NAPHL Showcase in San Jose in October where they were playing on the Pursuit of Excellence 14U team as a part of the Bantam Tournament Series . The names Alec and Rhett are classics , but it does n't  stop there with this duo .
