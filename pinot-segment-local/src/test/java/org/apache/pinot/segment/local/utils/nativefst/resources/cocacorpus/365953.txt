Some barriers to entry are placed by the government , while others could be related to cost . This results in different market structures such as monopolies or oligopolies ( a few firms ) . Telecommunications and international logistics are the two industries with the some of the highest barriers to entry . <h> Types of Barriers to Entry <h> Capital Costs <p> New investments are sometimes required to enter a market . Ex : For new telecom firms to enter the market , they have to lay down all the cable themselves , which is pretty expensive . <p> Competitors cant compete with other firms who have much lower production costs . Ex : Not many firms will be able to enter the soda market and compete against CocaCola . <h> Legal Barriers- To Entry <p> The government creates legal barriers by granting patents , copyrights , and exclusive rights to companies . <p> A copyright gives the creator of an original creative work exclusive rights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Disney has the copyright to Mickie Mouse , which allows it exclusive use . <p> A patent is a limited property right the government gives inventors in exchange for the details of their invention being made public . For example , for patents filed in the US , inventors are protected for twenty years from the filing date . <h> Marketing Barriers <p> Existing firms through high spending help create product uniqueness , advertising and brand image &amp; loyalty , which makes it hard for new firms to establish their similar products . <h> Limited Market <p> like a natural monopoly or small market size . Ex : There are n't  many railway firms in regional sectors , so the government usually controls the railway . <h> Takeover &amp; Merger <p> Mergers and acquisitions can be used to- eliminate- competition . Ex : There was a recent takeover attempt of T-Mobile by AT&amp;T . <h> - Vertical Integration <p> When firms in the market have control over the raw materials for their products , this makes it harder for newer firms to find suppliers . <h> - Predatory Pricing <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a loss to make competition more difficult for new firms that can not suffer such losses. - A large dominant firm with large lines of credit or cash reserves can continue to do this until the entrant runs out of money . 
@@101561508 @5761508/ <p> In general , demand side policies aim to change the aggregate demand in the economy . Aggregate Demand- is made up of Consumer Spending + Government Spending + Investment + Net Exports ( exports imports ) . So anything that effects these factors will affect demand . We tend to use demand side policies- for short term changes if inflation is getting too high , we can increase interest rates to cool the economy down . <p> Demand-side policies may be expansionary or contractionary in nature . Expansionary policies are intended to stimulate spending in a recessionary economy ; contractionary policies intended to reduce spending in an inflationary economy . <p> On the other hand , policymakers also have the option of using Supply Side Policies . These policies are aimed at increasing Aggregate Supply ( AS ) , a shift from left to right . Successful supply side policies lower the natural rate of unemployment . <h> Demand Side Policies : Fiscal Policy <p> In Keynesian economics , the output is determined by the level of Aggregate Demand .

Contractionary policies ( spending cuts or higher taxes ) tend to be politically unpopular and less likely to be used even if required- by economic conditions . <p> Monetary expansions are often less effective and less predictable as compared to monetary contractions . For example , if- the Central Bank- is concerned about weak economic growth or relatively high rates of unemployment . The policy reaction would be to increase bank reserves ( excess reserves ) through open market purchases . Banks would then be expected to convert these excess reserves into loans with their customers .

A more equitable distribution of income may help accelerate growth and promote economic development . Equitable does n't  mean equal distribution of income . It refers- to distribution of income that- is fair , but the concept of fair is subjective . <h> Why Do We Need- Equitable Distribution of Income ? <p> The- propensity- to consume- is- the proportion of income of your income spent on purchases . For example , if you earned $2000 and spend $1800 on all your purchases then your propensity to consume is at 90% . However , if you earned $18000 and still only spent $1800 then your propensity to consume is at 10%. - The poorer have a- higher propensity to consume so the redistribution of income will increase consumption and thus aggregate demand .

No country however rich or large makes everything it needs or has all the resources for its manufacturing industries. - International trade enables countries to have access to products which they are unable to produce or make . Many small countries of the world have become wealthy from their oil deposits . They exchange their oil for the motor cars and airplanes- which are manufactured by countries like the United States , Japan and Germany which have little or no oil deposits- of their own . <p> However , governments are for- trade barriers . They believe that free trade is bad for their economies and hurts growth and employment. - So , what are the arguments used to impose trade barriers ? <h> 5 Reasons Governments Are For Trade Barriers <h> - To protect domestic jobs from " cheap " labor abroad . <p> However , generally wages in industrialized countries are higher because their output per worker is higher . The high wages reflect higher productivity . Otherwise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the owners would- reduce wages to match productivity . <p> For example , the US has sugar import tariffs , making imported sugar more expensive than domestically-grown sugar . Thus , people in the US are going to buy US-grown sugar , which keeps money in the wallets of US sugar producers and farmers . <h> - To improve a trade deficit . <p> Trade barriers make imports more expensive and also decreases demand for imports . However , trade partners can do the same and increase prices for exports . This policy also does n't  necessarily fix the problem , if domestically produced goods are n't  competitive or are- not of good quality . Countries will also spend less on imports if their exports go down . <h> - To protect " infant industries " . <p> Countries want to give newly developing industries ( known as infant industries ) time to grow and become competitive . However , in some cases the government protection never ends and these industries become competitive only because they have been given the benefit of the trade barrier . <h> - Protection from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sold at below average cost of production . It is generally hard to prove and sometimes countries impose anti-dumping duties just to buy more time . <h> - To provide more revenue . <p> Governments gain extra revenue from tariffs ( taxes on imports ) . A- tariff is a tax on imports . The tariff maybe in the form of a specific or ad valorem tax . Tariffs raise the price of the imported good and lowers its consumption .

When the Aggregate Demand curve causes an increase in inflation , its called Demand-Pull Inflation . <p> It involves inflation rising as real Gross Domestic Product rises and unemployment falls , as the economy moves along the Phillips Curve . Demand-Pull Inflation- is commonly described as " too much money chasing too few goods " . More accurately , it should be described as involving " too much money spent chasing too few goods " , since only money that is spent on goods and services can cause inflation . This is not- expected to happen , unless the economy is already at a full employment level. - The term demand-pull inflation is mostly associated with Keynesian economics . <p> Demand-Pull Inflation <p> The effect of inflation will depend on how steep the Aggregate Supply curve is , as in how close it is to full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rise in inflation .

Consumers will buy fewer imports , while exports grow . There will be a rise in- Aggregate Demand . <h> Government Spending <p> An vast increase in government spending will drive up Aggregate Demand . <h> Expectations <p> The expectation that inflation will rise often leads to a rise in inflation . Workers and firms will increase their prices to catch up to inflation . <h> Monetary Growth <p> There is excessive monetary growth when they is too much money in the system chasing too few goods . The price of a good will thus increase . <h> Example of Demand-Pull Inflation <p> We can take an example of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 100 square miles .

However , the- data now suggests- that the country is- falling behind on its growth target . <p> The central bank of Staples- is- eager to maintain the growth rate . The central banks decides to enact an aggressive expansionary monetary policy . It decreased the discount rate to- push interest rates down , purchased government bonds , decreased required reserve ratios and let the commercial banks loosen credit standards . This- resulted in a massive increase in consumption . The countrys demand for cars and refrigerators- increased to- 5,000 cars per month and 3,000 refrigerators per quarter respectively . However , the country- could only produce 2,000 cars per month and 1,500 refrigerators per quarter . <h> The Result ? <p> Staples is now experiencing Demand-Pull inflation. - The decline in growth rate was due to aging- population and decaying- infrastructure . The problem could only be solved by- improving- the skills of the workforce and by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ policy , the excess- money increased demand , without increasing- the- capacity . <h> Countering Demand-Pull Inflation <p> To counter demand-pull inflation , governments and central banks would have to implement tight monetary and fiscal policy like- increasing the interest rate or lowering government spending , or raising taxes. - An increase in the interest rate would make consumers spend less on durable goods and housing. - It would also- investment spending by firms- and businesses. - In demand-pull inflation , Aggregate Demand D is rising too fast , so these contractionary policies would lower the rise , meaning inflation would still occur but at a lower rate . <p> In the diagram above , with a- tight monetary and fiscal policy , Aggregate Demand shifts from AD1 to AD* , instead of AD2 ( a higher rate of inflation ) . This leads to an equilibrium price level of P* and output Y* , instead of P2 and Y2.

Rising prices cause demand for higher wages , which leads to higher production costs and further upward pressure on prices . <h> Example- of Cost-Push Inflation <p> In early 1970s , the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Counties ( OPEC ) took steps to decrease global oil supply in order to boost price levels . This resulted in a supply shock and an- increase in general- prices , since oil is an important component of most production processes . Since there was no increase in demand , this rise in inflation- can be attributed to Cost-Push Inflation . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a shift or decrease in the Aggregate Supply curve from AS1 to AS2 , resulting in a lower Real GDP and higher prices ( from P1 to P2 ) . <h> Causes of Cost-Push Inflation <h> Supply Shock <p> When there is a big increase in prices of critical commodities like oil . This results in higher transport costs and all firms would see a rise in costs . <h> Higher Wages <p> Wages form a large percentage of costs for firms. - Strong- labor unions can influence inflation as they push for higher wages , which will leads to an increase in costs of production for the firm and hence higher priced goods . <h> Imported Inflation <p> A devaluation of the currency would result in- higher prices of imported goods . <h> Higher Taxes <p> An increase in indirect taxation . Higher VAT and Excise duties will increase the prices of goods . <h> Countering Cost-Push Inflation <p> The only counter to cost-push inflation- are supply side policies , but they are often controversial and difficult to implement .

With a contractionary monetary policy , Aggregate Demand shifts from AD- to AD* , the new equilibrium price is P1 and output Y* . This output ( Y* ) is lower than the initial output and Y2 , but its at a lower price level .

Low consumer debt increases consumption and aggregate demand . <h> Wealth <p> Wealth are assets held by a household , such as property or stocks .

The following factors affect Supply and changes in these determinants will shift the SC . <h> - Input Prices <p> If the price of raw materials used in the production of a product goes down , then S- will increase , i.e. shift to the right .

This leads to the very confusion question of when does it make sense to buy and when does it make sense to rent ? Let 's examine the economics of buying vs renting a textbook by first analyzing the unique problem in the textbooks market , touching upon the- failure of ebooks and breaking down a real life- example of a popular economics textbook . <h> Textbooks are Expensive <p> According to a study done by CollegeBoard , a student spends roughly $1,300 a year on textbooks , regardless of whether its a four- year undergraduate program or a two year community college degree . In fact , - the average price of a new textbook increased from $57 in 2007 to $65 in 2010 and to $79 in 2013 .

Since the- professor is not actually making the purchase herself , she is not directly affected by the cost of the book . This gives publishers a free- reign in setting prices as the end buyer of the book is someone who does n't  have- any other option- and is forced to buy at the publishers price . <h> The Failure of eBooks <p> With the rise of ebooks and ebook readers , there are even more- ways to acquire a class textbook . While the marginal cost of producing an additional- physical copy of a book is expensive , people expected ebooks to reduce the cost of books. - Despite these predictions , ebook prices are- generally only a bit lower than a physical book. - This is- despite the marginal cost of selling an extra @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cover the server cost . Where are the $10-25 textbooks ? <h> The Economics of Buying vs Renting a Textbook <p> Let 's take a- look- at an example of a very popular introductory economics book by Professor- Gregory Mankiw , - Principles of Economics- 6th Edition . For book rentals , we will use a four- month time period because a semester generally lasts around four- months . I am also comparing prices on Amazon.com and mostly- from sellers with the Prime shipping option ( since it eliminates shipping costs from our calculations ) . <h> eBook version <p> You can either choose to buy or rent the eBook . I do n't  know of any method to resell the eBook , so I assume its good for just one person . <p> If you trade it back to Amazon at the end of the semester , you can get $3.98 in Amazon Gift Card credit and do not pay for shipping it to Amazon .

Even if your book does not sell , you can trade it to Amazon for $3.98 . <h> Total- Amount Spent : $8.67 to $21.41 <h> Paperback version ( A.K.A.

This is a surprising revelation Amazon is offering more for a paperback than hard book ! <p> OR <p> You can try selling it on Amazon yourself as a marketplace seller . Assuming you can- sell the book- for $19.48 ( the current price of a used paperback and the price you purchased it at ) , after subtracting Amazon fees ( $2.92 or 15% ) and shipping ( USPS Media Mail at $3.57 for under- 3 pounds ) , you 're left with $12.99 . <p> Since you only have one option here , I- assume you buy the used paperback and resell it at the end of the semester . <h> Total Amount Spent : $6.49 to $14.29 <h> Loose Leaf version <p> These are not sold on Amazon Prime , so the buyer pays for shipping $3.99 ( included in the costs below ) .

After subtracting Amazon fees ( $5.70 or 15% ) and shipping ( USPS Media Mail at $4.05 for under 4- pounds ) , you 're left with $28.24 . <p> I- assume you buy the used looseleaf- and resell it at the end of the semester . <h> Total Amount Spent : $9.75 <h> The Overseas Version <p> Many students have figured out that textbooks are generally cheaper overseas , and- Principles of Economics- is no exception . I found the same 6th edition of the book on Amazon India in paperback format for just- G450.00 which is approximately $7 . However , Amazon India does not ship outside India. - Interestingly you could buy dozens of copies of this book in India at $7 and resell them for $25 comfortably , earning you $17.20 per book after fees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> For a textbook that ranges from $19.48 all the way to $268.32 on Amazon.com , these are definitive rankings for each version : <p> Paperback - $6.49 <p> Hardcover - $8.67 <p> Loose Leaf - $9.75 <p> eBook - $70.81 <p> Through this example , it is clear that in the question of buying vs renting a textbook , you 're better off purchasing and reselling . Since this post was written in June , there may be a fall in prices of used textbooks in the Fall as students coming back to class will put their copies- up for sale . I also have not accounted for a new edition being released , which would nearly destroy the used book market for the current edition .

@@101561559 @5761559/ <h> Trade Finance <p> Banks involved in commercial lending provide a wide range of financing packages for international trade , commonly called trade finance . Trade finance not only assists the buyer in financing its purchase but also provides immediate cash to the seller for the sale . This- is profitable for the lending institution . This mechanism is an important financing or credit device , providing the seller and buyer with a mechanism for financing the international sale . <h> The Documentary Draft and the Bank Collection Process <p> A- draft that is to be paid upon presentation or demand is known as a sight draft because it is payable " on sight " . The sight draft is prepared by the seller and is sent to the buyer along with shipping documents . The draft is sent " for collection " , know as a documentary collection . The draft and documents are accompanied by a collection letter that provides instructions from the seller on such matters are who is responsible for bank charges , what to do in the event the buyer dishonors the draft , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seller . <p> Essentially , documentary collections function like a cash-on-delivery transaction . When the sight draft is presented to the buyer at its bank or place of business , it is paid and the payment is remitted to the seller . Only then does the bank turn over the shipping documents with which the buyer can claim its cargo from the carrier . If a sales contract between buyer and seller calls for payment upon presentation of a sight draft , the contract terms commonly call for cash against documents . There is no guarantee the buyer will pay when presented with the documents . <h> The Use of Time Drafts and Acceptances <p> The use of a documentary draft in trade finance works like this : A seller agrees to issue a draft that is due , say , sixty days after shipment of goods . The draft states that it is due in sixty days or on a future date specified on the instrument . A draft due at a future date or after a specified period is known as a time draft . <p> The time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this is typically done by stamping " accepted " across the face of the draft . Under the UCC , the acceptance " may consist of the drawees signature alone " . The buyer has thus created a trade acceptance . The buyers acceptance indicates the buyers unconditional obligation to pay the draft on the date due . <p> A draft payable at " sixty days after date " is payable by the drawee sixty days after the original date of the instrument . <p> A draft payable at " sixty days sight " is payable sixty days after the date of acceptance . <p> As with a sight draft , a seller usually sends the time draft together with the shipping documents to the buyer through banking channels with instructions to the banks that the shipping documents should be handed over to the buyer only upon acceptance of the draft . The sales contract would have indicated the parties agreement to this arrangement by calling for " documents against acceptance " . After acceptance , the draft is returned through banking channels to the seller . The seller can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a discount to a local ban or commercial lending institution for immediate cash . The commercial lender takes the acceptance by negotiation . The greater the creditworthiness of the buyer , the greater the marketability of the trade acceptance . <h> ii . Bankers Acceptances and Acceptance Financing <p> A bankers acceptance is a negotiable instrument and short-term financing device widely used to finance international and domestic sales . The purpose of an acceptance is to substitute a banks credit for that of the buyer in order to finance the sale . It is- a time draft drawn on and accepted by a commercial bank . The bank stamps its name , date and signature on the face of the draft to create the acceptance and thereby becomes obligated to pay the amount stated to the holder of the instrument on the date specified . <p> Importing buyers can use a bankers acceptance for short-term borrowing until they can resell and liquidate the goods being purchased .

Bankers acceptances are generally short-term instruments because they must be for a period of six months or less . <p> An eligible bankers acceptance is one that qualifies for discount at the U.S. Federal Reserve Bank , which will buy it if it is not sold privately . <h> iii . Credit Risk in Trade Finance Programs <p> Institutions prearrange financing terms by agreeing in advance to purchase the trade acceptances of the foreign buyer . This done through an evaluation of the buyers financial position , however to reduce credit risk and lower the cost of trade finance , several government agencies provide credit guarantees to back trade finances . These include Eximbank and the Agency for International Development . <h> iv . Credit Risk in Acceptance Financing Rights of the Holder in Due Course <p> One of the primary reasons for the popularity of the acceptance as a financing device is the protection it provides to the financial institution or other party who purchases it , provided that party is a holder in due course .

The most common type of dispute is a breach of contract . Example : Assume that DownPillow sells pillows to a Japanese buyer and forwards documents and a draft for acceptance . DownPillow discounts the trade acceptance to a U.S. bank , which then discounts the instrument to the credit markets . If the pillows turn out to be moldy and worthless , the Japanese buyer must still honor and pay the acceptance upon presentation in Japan . It may then assert its separate claim for breach of contract against DownPillow .

DownPillow now has its money and the bank is awaiting payment directly from Japan . If a dispute breaks out over the quality of the pillows , the Japanese buyer may legally assert any claims and defenses against the collection by the bank . The buyer can then argue it does n't  have to pay the bank because of breach of warranty by DownPillow .

It is also the slope of the demand curve . The slope is calculated as rise over run . For example , if I increase the price of a phone from $300 to $500 , then how much can I expect my demand to fall by ? This answer will depend on various factors mentioned below that will help the firm calculate its Price Elasticity of Demand . <h> Factors that Affect the Price Elasticity of Demand <p> Price Elasticity of Demand helps producers determine their change in Total Revenue if they have to change the price of the product ( Quantity of goods they sell x the Price its sold at at ) .

Ex : If the price of gasoline goes up , over time people will adjust for the change , i.e. drive less or use public transportation or carpool . <h> Habit <p> Addictive or habitual products are usually inelastic . Ex : If the price for- cigarettes goes up , it will have almost no effect on demand . <h> Uses of Price Elasticity of Demand <p> Allows a firm to predict the change in revenue with the change in price . <p> Firms can charge different prices in different markets if elasticities differ in income groups .

For example , the buyer could prohibit the bank from taking documents showing a partial shipment , or it could require a document that shows a specific method of shipping . However , the buyer must remember that this information is based on the buyers final agreement with the seller . <p> If the bank violates any terms of its contract with the buyer , then the buyer need not take the documents or reimburse the bank . For instance , if the buyers application requests the bank to issue a letter of credit calling for the seller to submit documents showing that it shipped " 1,000 electric toasters " , and the bank , without approval , purchases documents showing that the seller shipped 1,000 toaster ovens , " then the bank is not entitled to reimbursement .

The advising bank is not liable on the credit , it only provides the service of forwarding the letter of credit to the seller and checking the authenticity of the letter of credit . <h> Sellers Compliance with Letter of Credit <p> The letter of credit tells the seller what it must do in order to be paid . It tells him or her what to shop , how to ship , when to ship , and more . It contains specific terms and conditions drawn from the original sales contract and included in the letter of credit , such as the quantity and description of the goods , shipping dates , the type or amount of insurance , and so on . For example : A buyer in California @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strict flammability standards for upholstered furniture . The letter of credit might call for an inspection certificate to show that the chairs passed Californias standards . <p> The seller should inspect the letter of credit to see if it keeps up with the agreement with the buyer in the underlying contract of sale . The seller should examine other conditions of the credit to be certain that they can be met , such as can the seller acquire materials and manufacture on time for the shipment date ? If the seller is unable to comply wight he letter of credit for any reason , the buyer must be contacted and an amended letter of credit can be issued . <h> Complying Presentation <p> A- presentation is the delivery of the sellers documents and drafts to the nominated bank or directly to the issuing bank .

If no bank is nominated , then the letter of credit is said to be " freely available " and can be negotiated through any bank of the sellers choice . <h> Examination of Documents for Discrepancies <p> The UCP permits banks only to examine the documents " on their face " to see whether they comply with the letter of credit or whether there is a discrepancy . Banks may not look to any outside sources or conduct any independent investigation to see if the sellers shipment to the buyer is in good order . For example , a letter of credit calls for the shipment of " 1,000 blood pressure monitoring kits . " The shippers invoice shows the sale and shipment of " 1,000 sphygmomanometers and cuffs .

It need not be signed , notarized , or verified , unless the credit requires . Where a commercial invoice is required , a preliminary " pro forma " invoice will not be accepted . The most important requirement is that the description of the goods in the commercial invoice must correspond to that in the credit . <h> The Ocean Bill of Lading <p> For transactions in which the letter of credit calls for presentment of an " on-board " bill of lading , the seller must present to the issuing bank a bill of lading showing the actual name of the ship , containing the notation " on board " , indicating that the goods have been actually loaded . Where the buyer and seller have agreed , and where it is approved in the letter of credit , it is acceptable for the bill of lading to show that the carrier has received the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Although these certificates are not required for the letter of credit transaction , sellers should ensure that certificates they include with their documents meet all the terms required by the letter of credit . <h> Other Types of Letters of Credit <h> Confirmed Letters of Credit <p> Aconfirmed letter of credit is one which a second bank , usually in the sellers country , has agreed to purchase documents and honor drafts on the same terms as the original issuing bank . A letter of credit confirmed by a bank in the sellers country will ensure prompt payment regardless of financial or political instability in the country where the issuing bank is located . However , a confirmed letter of credit is more expensive than an unconfirmed letter of credit . <h> Standby Letters of Credit <p> Astandby letter of credit is one in which the issuer is obligated to pay a beneficiary upon the presentation of documents indicating a default by the account party in the payment of a debt or the performance of an obligation . A standby letter of credit is a backup payment mechanism that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It can be used to guarantee performance under a service or construction contract , to guarantee repayment of a loan , or as security for almost any other type of contract . <h> Specialized Uses for Letters of Credit <h> Red Clauses in Credits <p> The red clause in credits is a financing tool for smaller sellers who need capital to produce the products to be shipped under a letter of credit . A red clause in a letter of credit is a promise by the issuing bank to reimburse the sellers bank for loans made to the seller . The loan , then , is really advance on the credit . Loans can be used only for purchasing raw materials or for covering the costs of manufacturing or shipping of the goods described in the credit . <h> Revolving and Evergreen Credits <p> When a buyer is planning on purchasing on a regular basis from a foreign seller , a revolving letter of credit may be used .

EXIM bank programs cover both the risk of nonpayment and political risk . <h> Commodity Credit Corporation <p> The U.S. Department of Agricultures Commodity Credit Corporation provides payment assurances to U.S. sellers of surplus agricultural products to approved foreign buyers . Sellers often use standby letters of credit since- they can draw under the credit for invoices that remain unpaid by the overseas buyer . <h> Law Applicable to Letters of Credit <h> The Uniform Customs and Practice for Documentary Credits <p> The Uniform Customs and Practice for Documentary Credits ( UCP ) is set of standardized rules for issuing and handling letters of credit , drafted and published by the International Chamber of Commerce with the assistance of the international banking community .

Because banks were the main drafters of the UCP , its provisions tend to protect their rights in any transaction . The Uniform Commercial Code now defers to the UCP , as a result the UCP has a far greater impact on the law of international letters of credit than does the Uniform Commercial Code . <h> Irrevocability of Letters of Credit <p> Letters of credit issued under UCP 600 are presumed irrevocable unless clear language is used to make them revocable . <h> The Independence Principle of Letters of Credit <p> The independence principle is a general rule of law that states that the letter of credit is independent of the sales contract between buyer and seller . Think of it as though the bank is purchasing documents for its customer . In UCP 600 , Article 5 states " Banks deal with documents and not with goods . " Banks are neither concerned with the quality nor the condition of the goods . <h> The Rule of Strict Compliance <p> According to the rule of strict compliance , the terms of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the requirements of the letter of credit and the UCP . The thrust of the rule is that every provision of the bill of lading , invoice , insurance policy and any other required shipping document must match the letter of credit . Even a small discrepancy can cause the bank to reject the documents . The reason for such a harsh rule is simple ; it relieves bankers from the duty of interpreting the meaning of the discrepancy or its possible impact on their customer , and it relieves them of the liability of interpreting it incorrectly .
