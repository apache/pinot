Over the next 10 years , we will invest $4.9 billion in upgrading and expanding our infrastructure to add capacity for a further 95,000 homes . <p> Currently , there are numerous major projects under way across Auckland . At the Mangere Wastewater Treatment Plant , we are carrying out a $141-million project to increase the biological nutrient removal ( BNR ) capacity . This will enable the plant to treat the wastewater from a further 50,000 people effectively , without compromising the health of the Manukau Harbour .

Since it was commissioned in the early 2000s we have increased its water production per day from 75 million litres to 125 million litres to 150 million litres as the community has grown . A further expansion will be completed by the end of next year .

Therefore , our third step is to calculate the net present value of the depreciation and finance portion of money we will receive from water and wastewater charges over an average asset life . <p> Fourthly , we reduce the total cost of delivering growth-related infrastructure to a property by the net present value of future interest and depreciation payments , paid through ongoing water and wastewater charges . This ensures the developer is not charged twice for the same asset . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cost of growth-related infrastructure rather than the full amount that can be recovered by an IGC . Our intention is to increase our IGC over time to recover more of the cost of growth-related infrastructure from the growth community . We recognise the need to balance our intention to align the costs and benefits of growth-related investment with the broader public good it generates . <p> - You will not be charged an IGC if you have paid a water and wastewater development contribution to council . <p> - <p> IGCs were introduced on 1 July 2011 . If you paid a development contribution to council before then , it may have provided for water and wastewater infrastructure . This means you will not have to pay an IGC unless the scale or intensity has increased since the original contribution was paid . <p> - <p> When you apply for a new connection , let us know if you believe a development contribution has been paid . We will confirm with council whether a development contribution that covers water and wastewater infrastructure has been paid in the past . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provide a connection . However , for developers who are building on a large scale with staged developments we can consider whether staged payments are appropriate . <p> An IGC is not refundable but it does n't disappear either . If you 're redeveloping a site and demolish part or all of the existing buildings , any IGC or Development Contribution for water and wastewater paid previously ( even by the previous land owner ) will be used as a credit towards the redevelopment . <p> The IGC is a one-off charge , unless you intend to use more water or connect more dwellings to our network . <p> For example , if you have a factory and increase your water use , you will need to pay an IGC to cover the increased demand that your factory puts on our infrastructure ( even if you do n't need a new connection ) . <p> If only wastewater services are available on your street and you have to install a rainwater tank , you will be charged half the IGC for connecting to our wastewater network . <p> - <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ street , you will be charged the full IGC regardless of installing a rainwater tank . While you may think a rainwater tank would reduce demand on our network , unfortunately it does not reduce the money we must invest in infrastructure . <p> We have to provide infrastructure to accommodate peak ' demand . Typically , peak ' demand occurs when people 's rainwater tanks are empty and they are relying on our supply " either through their own mains connection or through water tanker operators who source their water from us . <p> If you are a non-domestic customer then your IGC will be calculated based on the volume of water you expect to use . If you are a non-domestic customer then your IGC will be calculated based on the volume of water you expect to use . Therefore , if you install water saving devices that will reduce your water demand , it- will reduce your IGC . <p> Yes , the infrastructure growth charge contributes towards the capital investment of bulk infrastructure. - These are not the assets which are built to reticulate developments or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In November 2010 , the city and district councils across the Auckland region merged into one ; Auckland Council . As part of this amalgamation , Watercare took on the management of water and wastewater services for Auckland . The IGC was introduced in 2011 to replace the charges and rates charged by the former councils or their water suppliers to cover the costs of bulk infrastructure investment . <p> When Watercare took over charging for Auckland 's water and wastewater services in 2010 , we inherited a pricing regime which did not reflect the true costs to cover Auckland 's development and growth . <p> - <p> Watercare 's only funding sources are from customer charges so we must recover all of our costs . The IGC- to connect to our services should reflect the cost incurred by Watercare for providing that service . Since 2010 , we have been progressively shifting the cost of growth to IGC , rather than seeing larger increases in the water and wastewater charges for all of our existing customers .
