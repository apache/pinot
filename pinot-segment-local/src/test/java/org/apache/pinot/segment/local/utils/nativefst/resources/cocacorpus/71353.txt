The company , which makes software to help operators deliver IP-based services like voice , video , and messaging over their LTE networks , is now working on a software-based extensible Radio Access Network ( xRAN ) architecture that could make hardware-based RAN a thing of the past . <p> Mavenir has been in quite a transition lately . The company launched in 2005 , went public in 2013 , and then was purchased by Mitel in 2015 . Mitel then turned around and sold Mavenirs assets to Siris Capital Group , which then merged Mavenir with Xura , which acquired Ranzure Networks on February 1 and then divested Xuras non-core enterprise messaging business . The result is a new Mavenir dedicated to creating a software-based RAN . The company is headed by former Xura CEO Pardeep Kohli and is based in Richardson , Texas . <h> SPONSORED <p> In an interview with SDxCentral , Kohli said the companys business goal is to make the radio piece of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the xRAN Foundation , a consortium formed last year to promote software-based RAN . Deutsche Telekom is a founding member of the xRAN Foundation and other members include AT&amp;T , SK Telecom , and Verizon . <p> The xRAN group set forth some goals to change RAN architecture in the following three areas : <p> Decouple the RAN control plane from the user plane , build a modular eNode B software stack that operates on common-off-the-shelf ( COTS ) hardware , and publish open north- and south-bound interfaces to the industry ; <p> Migrate formerly tightly-bound-to-RAN hardware devices into accessible computing devices to allow the RAN to be more efficiently orchestrated as a logical pool of capacity ; and <p> Standardize north and southbound interfaces with multiple vendor support and interoperability . <p> According to Kohli , Mavenirs technology separates the RAN control plane from the user plane and then uses software that operates on Intel processors . However , it could also use off-the-shelf or general purpose hardware . <p> This in turn allows operators to do things like carrier aggregation without having to switch out hardware . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but every time they add more functionality , they have to switch out hardware on the base station , " Kohli said . <p> Plus , it also allows operators to make better use of their towers , which often sit idle for huge amounts of time . " Basically a huge amount of capacity is sitting idle , " Kohli said . " When it is in the cloud , you can share it . You can share hardware capacity across users . " <p> Kohli said that by sharing hardware capacity across users , the wireless operators can learn from the webscale companies , which are already doing this . " In a small cell siting scenario in your home you have a box with a Qualcomm chip that is hardly ever getting used , " he said . " But if you put that in a data center its shared across users .

This interview has been edited for clarity . <p> What have you seen as some of the more important features of AT&amp;T 's ongoing work in virtualizing network assets as part of its Domain 2.0 program ? <p> Fuetsch : We 've been on this software-defined journey for quite some time now , and there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : virtualization , which is basically virtualizing these network functions ; control , which is what level of SDN control do we have for that function ; and automation , which is how much of that particular function have we automated in terms of the care , feeding , support , and monitoring . <p> The reason our SDN journey is so important is that everything we are doing to virtualize as much of the network as possible is also to control it more efficiently . It 's not a binary yes or no , it 's a wide spectrum . What I mean is you can take an existing network function from the old world and just port it right over and run it on top of a cloud stack , but that gets a low score . To get a high score you need to re-architect that function and make it more cloud native . <p> On the SDN control side it 's also not a binary answer .

As an example , one of our mobile packet cores is a fully virtualized mobile packet core . As we are moving to 5G , it 's a matter of how do you control those assets ? How do you automate those assets ? How do you get the operational efficiencies you want ? How do you get more speed and service delivery ? That 's everything we 've been doing with our program . <p> The big lynchpin that holds this all together is ECOMP , or what is now called ONAP .

We can leverage that as true 5G comes to fruition . <p> As true 5G and standards get codified by the end of the year , and the specifications , the silicon , and the equipment get built we hope to be in a position to start deployments as early as late next year . We are in a pretty unique position because you are going to need these SDN surrounds to support all of this dynamic capability , the real-time control , and the network slicing features . <p> Have you been happy with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in terms of your software migration plans ? <p> Fuetsch : - It 's getting better day-by-day . Certainly it 's not going as fast as we want , and we put a lot of pressure on our supply chain to deliver , but it depends on what particular area . <p> With ECOMP there was nothing off the shelf that we could find at that time to really drive us to this model-driven architecture of automation and orchestration platform that we needed . So we had to go out and just build it ourselves . Then we realized this platform is pretty big , complex , and needs to evolve at a faster rate than we could do ourselves , and that was the impetus behind why we wanted to open source it . <p> If we put enough of a framework out there but not give away our secret sauce , we think it will provide enough value and a standard that the entire industry can coalesce around . And we could all contribute to the platform in a way that would advance the tide that would lift @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as we were the first into production and market . <p> The biggest value for us was to expand the developer pool and community and get more contributions and more commits . And this is not just for us , but also for the whole industry . We are seeing a lot of interaction with the webscale companies through the Linux Foundation with interest in wanting to get involved . <p> Think of the big use cases : AR , VR , and autonomous cars . Think of the webscale companies interested in those . What they are finding out is to make those use cases a reality 5G is going to be real important . Mobile operators are going to be a very important part of the equation . That 's why they want to get involved with what the architecture will look like . <p> We donated a huge code base to the community and obviously we have some influence with it , but it 's really in the community 's control now . <p> How is AT&amp;T progressing on its software migration plans in terms of hitting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? <p> Fuetsch : - Our ambitions are not going to stop at 75 percent . We 're going to go beyond that . When I set that goal three years ago we felt there were network elements that would still be in the network that would not make economic sense to pull out as quickly . But , what we are seeing is that as we are getting closer to 2020 , I predicted that we would actually raise the goal . <p> Now certainly we knew we would not get to 100 percent as there 's always going to be some of those straggler technologies where the economic justification to pull them out of the network would not make sense , but that those would just be a small number . But , I would say for the most part you can expect us to go much further than 75 percent , and at the rate we are going you can expect us to have a good chance to surpass 75 percent before 2020 . <h> SPONSORED <p> Dan Meyer is a Senior Editor at SDxCentral , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ automation and DevOps .

Handling these support tickets for application provisioning typically means that the IT team needs to figure out capacity , network topology , and dependencies with existing apps or tenants . <h> SPONSORED <p> But it is n't all despondency in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which have long been the forte of large cloud providers such as Google , Amazon , and Microsoft are making their way to enterprises . A core guiding principle of these web giants is that they have rejected the " dedicated appliance " mindset and its inherent architectural limitations when it comes to application services . They realize the power of services such as a load balancing implemented in software ( and deployed on general purpose servers ) to provide much more fluid models of application handling . These application delivery architectures are improving how IT handles scalability requirements , deploys applications in cloud environments , and manage new applications such as container-based microservices . In addition to foundational software-defined approaches , let us take a look at the core tenets for this new world of application networking services . <h> Self-Service and Automation <p> DevOps teams love the idea of delivering infrastructure-as-code it frees them from the wait times that are associated with submitting support tickets to network teams that are already stretched thin . It is no surprise that lines of business that are measured by their ability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them to easily deliver associated services . Software-defined load balancing with application program interface ( API ) -driven functionality is bringing these capabilities to data center applications . The added advantage is that app teams can spin up their own load balancers in test environments and carry forward the application to production with a consistent application services architecture . <h> Per-App Services <p> Without the dependency on dedicated hardware for load balancing services and without the constraint of consolidating the services of multiple apps or tenants into appliances , enterprises can deliver unique application services on a per-app basis . This eliminates the need to purchase and configure load balancers based on the neediest application configured on the appliance and the typical cost overruns associated with the approach . Other advantages of the per-app model include natural isolation of applications , better uptime and availability , and scalability . <h> Central Control <p> Load balancers should mimic the dynamic nature of modern applications where servers can be spun up or down and IP addresses are often ephemeral . A central orchestration point with oversight of the distributed load balancing fabric @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fabric , can ensure that load balancers are always configured correctly and new virtual services are easily added where needed . Administrators can get complete visibility to all VIPs configured and other application dependencies . <h> Horizontal Scale <p> For a long time , the needs of traditional applications dictated the approach that enterprises chose for scaling application services . With monolithic or n-tier applications front ended by load balancers , the focus was on scaling up services by upgrading to appliances that could deliver bigger and better throughputs or transactions per second . On the other hand , web-scale architectures enable an approach to elasticity that involves horizontal scale out of services , which is better for cloud-native and microservices-based applications with vast amounts of east-west traffic . Application services can be spun up just-in-time based on real-time traffic patterns and scaled back down when traffic recedes . <h> Multi-Cloud Deployment <p> According to the Rightscale 2017 State of the Cloud Report , 95 percent of enterprises are using the cloud with 67 percent of enterprises investing in hybrid cloud technologies . Increasingly , IT executives want to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Web-scale approaches for application services can drive uniformity of deployment architecture across multiple cloud environments while still delivering centralized management of services . <h> Application Performance and Monitoring <p> One of the biggest benefits that can be gained by web-scale architectures for load balancers is to take full advantage of the important position of load balancers in the network . With a distributed fabric of load balancers that are centrally controlled , it is possible to collect real-time application traffic data using telemetry from each load balancer that can be analyzed and from which application insights can be derived . Such insights including transaction round trip times , security data ( TLS version , ciphers used etc. ) , location and devices of end users , and application data accessed can reduce troubleshooting times for common application failures . <p> The maturing of web-scale capabilities and the corresponding evolution of application architectures represents the best opportunity to provide dynamic and granular application services that match the needs of modern applications . Enterprises would do well to challenge the status quo and risk-aversion tendencies to try out new and better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wave of cloud-native applications . After all , web-scale application service architectures have satisfied the requirements in the toughest proving grounds and now are ready for broader enterprise adoption . 65700 @qwx265700 65704 @qwx265704 65708 @qwx265708 65706 @qwx265706 <p> Ranga is CTO and cofounder at Avi Networks and has been an architect and developer of several high-performance distributed operating systems , as well as networking and storage data center products .

The acceptance came after AT&amp;T told Straight Path it would not make any new bids . <h> SPONSORED <p> The deal values Straight Path stock at $184 per share , and will now see Verizon acquire 868 licenses in the 28 GHz and 39 GHz bands that are viewed as important to the deployment of 5G network technologies . Despite concerns over the ability to monetize mmWave spectrum licenses , the industry is moving aggressively to include bands above 15 GHz for 5Gservices due to the quantity of capacity available compared with traditional cellular license bands . <p> Verizon anticipates closing on the deal within nine months , subject to FCC review .

" Combined with our recent transactions with Corning Incorporated , XO Communications , and Prysmian Group , this is another step to build the next-generation network for our customers . " <p> Verizon recently signed fiber deals with Corning and Prysmian Group valued at more than $1.3 billion , and last year picked up fiber and mmWave spectrum in the 28 GHz band through a $1.8 billion acquisition of XO Communications . <p> Iain Gillott , founder of iGR , said the Straight Path @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any more traditional cellular spectrum , which was highlighted by the carrier emerging empty handed from the FCCs recent 600 MHz incentive auction proceedings . <p> " There is a lot of traditional spectrum out there in the hands of companies like Dish and Sprint , and Verizon did not go aggressively after any 600 MHz spectrum , so Verizon obviously feels like it does n't  need any more , " Gillott said . <p> Analysts also noted the deal showed considerable confidence from Verizon in being able to tap mmWave spectrum for 5G services . <p> " Verizon is not a dumb company , " said Gillott . " They have been running millimeter wave trials for some time now and obviously feel from what they have seen that they can make a business case for deploying services using that spectrum . They do n't  plop down $3 billion on hoping something will work .

" Its one thing to get it into the street , but to get it those last few hundred meters adds significantly to the cost structure . " <p> Madden envisioned Verizon being able to feed fiber into a street-level cell site supporting mmWave spectrum that could then beam a broadband signal into the side of an apartment building or multi-dwelling unit . <p> " This could be set up across the street from a multi-dwelling unit with 50 windows all facing the transmitter , " Madden explained . " Verizon could hit all of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> That model is similar to what Verizon is currently doing in terms of its pre-commercial 5G trials . Those trials are set to begin in 11 markets by the middle of the year , and will include fixed wireless services using several hundred cell sites covering several thousand customer locations . <h> Straight Path Rollercoaster <p> The bidding war was quite the turnaround for Straight Path , which earlier this year agreed to a $100 million settlement with the FCC for failure to deploy wireless services as required by the FCCs licensing policy . As part of that settlement , Straight Path had to surrender 196 of its licenses in the 39 GHz band , sell the remainder of its licenses , and give 20 percent of the proceeds of that sale to the U.S. Treasury Department . <p> Straight Path investors might have mixed feelings on the deal as the companys stock plunged this morning more than 20 percent on the announcement to around $179 per share .

@@21507712 @1507712/ <h> Four Key Challenges of Migrating Data Center Resources to AWS <p> Many enterprises have moved some , if not all , of their data center resources to Amazon Web Services ( AWS ) , while countless others are considering a move . The benefits of doing so are very appealing . AWS offers a vast suite of cloud-computing services that provide large , scalable computing capacity more quickly and affordably than an enterprise can build it themselves . <p> They want to establish a hybrid cloud- to keep their data centers and to augment connectivity or resources by renting public cloud services in order to scale up or down as needed . <p> They want to leverage the global presence of a cloud platform located in all major world geographies . <p> However , moving to AWS presents a number of challenges . <h> 1 . Maintaining User Experience <p> Typically , when data centers connect to AWS they do so through encrypted IP tunnels leveraging IPSec technology . Secure , yes . Efficient , not so much . IPSec tunnels are typically provisioned from centralized data centers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ data center network bandwidth . <p> Application latency rises because an enterprise has to backhaul network traffic . This typically happens from remote locations to centralized data centers through the wide area network and on to IPSec tunnels in order to reach AWS hosted resources . At the same time , data centers must also increase network bandwidth in order to accommodate this additional backhauled traffic . <p> When enterprises move resources to AWS , they must maintain the experience users have come to expect from data center-based applications . <h> 2 . Achieving Resiliency <p> In addition , enterprises must pay special attention to maintaining resiliency and service availability for applications and workloads hosted in AWS . <p> AWS provides two methods for achieving resilient connectivity into customer virtual private clouds ( VPCs ) . One is active/standby secure IPSec tunnels terminating on two redundant AWS virtual private gateways ( VGW ) . The other is a combination of a secure IPSec tunnel into VGW with an AWS Direct Connect service that builds a private circuit from the enterprise network into AWS VPC . <p> Leveraging IPSec tunnels is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the failover times may not be adequate for all enterprises . It also makes it challenging to efficiently utilize all available bandwidth . <p> The combination of IPSec tunnels and AWS Direct Connect offers active connectivity and full bandwidth utilization . However , it complicates routing of traffic across both paths . <h> 3 . Implementing Network Segmentation <p> Implementing security , including network segmentation , when moving resources to AWS , should be a primary concern . <p> Regardless of the kind of network segmentation mechanism being used in a data center " VLANs , VRFs , VXLAN or all of them " extending it to AWS is not easily accomplished . <p> For most enterprises , segmentation is not optional . Especially in industries that are governed by regulatory mandates for segregating sensitive information , such as confidential data , financial transactions , and patient healthcare data from other types of traffic . Migrating applications and data to AWS makes it difficult to maintain segmentation from private on-premises data centers to the cloud . <h> 4 . Centralized Monitoring and Operations <p> A large majority of enterprises rely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ data center elements , such as applications , workloads , networks , storage , etc . <p> While some of these monitoring tools may still be used for keeping tabs on resources in AWS , this approach often results in fragmented visibility between on-premises data centers and AWS environments . Meanwhile , monitoring tools and mechanisms available in AWS do not extend into enterprise environments and wide area networks . <p> To address these and other challenges , enterprises should consider alternatives for integrating AWS cloud data centers into the rest of their environment . This includes paying particular attention to the integration of AWS connectivity into the enterprise wide area network in a robust , secure , and feature-rich manner . <p> This can be accomplished using legacy technologies , but will introduce significant operational complexity . As an alternative , organizations can consider adopting new technologies that offer ready-made solutions for solving cloud migration challenges like software-defined wide area networking ( SD-WAN ) . 65700 @qwx265700 65704 @qwx265704 65708 @qwx265708 65706 @qwx265706 <h> SPONSORED <p> David Klebanov leads technical marketing at Viptela , the Software Defined Wide Area @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years of diverse industry experience architecting and deploying complex network environments .

@@21507715 @1507715/ <p> Apstra entered the enterprise networking scene in June 2016 with its intent-based operating system , which promised an innovative way to improve network agility and availability . <p> Less than a year later Gartner named Apstra a 2017 " cool vendor for enterprise networking . " The report said key benefits from its software include not only improved agility and availability , but also reduced capital expenditure and operating expenditure " through support of mixed-vendor configurations and optional disaggregated , fit-for-purpose switch hardware and software . " <h> SPONSORED <p> The analyst firm forecast that by 2020 more than 1,000 large enterprises will use intent-based networking systems , up from fewer than 25 today . It also said an intent-based networking system can reduce network infrastructure delivery times by 50 percent to 90 percent , while also reducing outages both the number of and duration of by at least 50 percent . <p> Although its a young startup , its founders are all industry veterans : Apstra CEO Mansour Karam worked at Arista and Big Switch , CTO Sasha Ratkovic was an engineer at Juniper Networks , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arista and a first investor in Google and VMware . <p> Earlier this month Apstra updated its flagship product , called the Apstra Operating System ( AOS ) . The new AOS 1.2 allows users to customize every aspect of AOS , including the intent model , tracked telemetry , and vendor-specific device agents . <p> SDxCentral recently caught up with Karam to talk about intent-based networking and the companys plans for the future . This interview has been edited for clarity . <p> What was your vision when you started Apstra ? <p> Karam : With Apstra , the vision we had was to deliver on what we call a self-operating network . In networking , and specifically in the data center , operational aspects havent been addressed to the extent that they need to be . For every dollar spent in capex , companies spend $3 to $5 in opex . Eighty percent of it is spent on manual operations . I like to say wasted on manual operations because everything that could be automated and that were not automating is indeed wasted . <p> With the network @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needs of an organization , we really need to focus on the operational aspect . So this was really the vision of Apstra in that we wanted to deliver an operational model that is fully autonomous . The network configures itself , defends itself , and is also self-compliant , meaning it audits itself . <p> If you look at the evolution of the industry , we believe this is the right time to do this . This problem existed before , but the urgency has n't  been as high as it is today . And because of that , we have an ecosystem today that would support an independent vendor coming in and delivering on a solution for this problem . <p> What is driving that urgency and why is now the right time for intent-based networking ? <p> Karam : If you look at my background , I 've been in data center networking since 2006 when I joined Arista . Even in the very early days of Arista we saw the cloud companies , what we call today the hyperscalers , coming in with new requirements . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ infrastructures that were built before with new requirements on the operational side . We were involved in those , with those customers , and I was intimately aware of those requirements . <p> The hyperscalers pushed the industry toward APIs , we cant just operate our networks , box per box , using the specific CLIs command line interfaces for those devices . In fact , they built their own teams to build out the automation that was required to deliver on those requirements . <p> Fast forward 10 years , these requirements are not only those of the largest hyperscalers , but now are spreading to essentially any organization that wants to participate in todays trends , whether its IoT or machine learning . Data centers require networking like never before and these organizations need to beef up their networking now they have the same requirements that hyperscalers had 10 years ago . This is not only the case for webscales but also large banks , large insurance companies , large retailers , they need to beef up their networking . <p> Customers really compelled the vendors to provide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have indeed opened up their APIs . Theyve published them , so now we have what I like to call a programmable infrastructure across vendors . <p> Now that you have this programmable infrastructure , we now have the conditions that allow for software like AOS or an intent-based networking system to exist , leveraging those APIs and delivering on the vision of a self-operating network . <p> What 's the scope of control of intent-based ? An area , an entire enterprise ? Does a whole network turn over human control to an algorithm ? How far does this extend ? <p> Karam : Intent-based is a notion . Its the notion that the user describes what they want ; they describe the desired outcome . You can apply it to many different use cases . Were starting with networking , and data center networking , so user intent usually can be described in terms of connectivity requirements , in terms of isolation requirements , multi-tenancy requirements . It also can be described in terms of performance requirements . <p> Once we 've built that platform , it is n't only applicable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like compute and storage . It does n't  have to be only applicable to the data center networks , it could be applicable to the campus networks . Its just a matter of adjusting the intent . <p> A lot of the machinery underneath essentially is the same around intent-based , closed-loop , vendor-agnostic automation . <p> Does this work across any sector , say healthcare , hospitals ? <p> Karam : With intent-based networking you get reliability and availability that ca n't be matched using manual systems . A lot of outages or infrastructure connectivity problems are the result of a user making an error . In a lot of cases , humans are causing those errors . Its true with driving on the highway ; its also true with networks and infrastructure . <p> Intent-based networking systems massively improve the reliability of your infrastructure . In fact , Gartner mentioned in their report that an intent-based networking system improves reliability and availability by at least 50 percent and reduces outage durations by at least 50 percent . Especially for mission-critical applications , having an intent-based networking system would dramatically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says , " Apstra faces the difficult task of changing how enterprise network teams think about the build and operation of their data center networks , via the use of algorithms to supplant human insights . " Are network CIOs ready to give up control to a machine ? <p> Karam : To be quite honest , I do n't  see this as giving up control to a machine . Ultimately the engineers and the architects are really in control . They 're the ones that do the engineering work of figuring out what they want from their infrastructure . The intent-based networking system essentially takes care of all of the manual steps , it takes care of automating all of the manual steps . It really allows them to focus on being engineers and architects instead of spending their time doing the mundane manual stuff . Its not that the system is taking control , you 're programming the system . A computer does n't  get tired . It can work 24-7 , so now the system is now taking care of delivering on your design . <p> For example , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this real-time analytics , it ensures that the network is behaving as per your intent . Essentially this is what a network engineer would do to troubleshoot the system . They would have to run all of these tests manually . But an intent-based networking system can run through these tests continuously , 24-7 . When its done with the last test , it starts again with the first test . <p> Having a system take care of those tests really relieves the end user from having to do this themselves . At the same time , they are the one that initially designed those tests . <p> Let 's go back to the use cases . <p> Karam : Today we support use cases around data center networking , leaf-spine network designs , which are typical in the data center today . Customers that are migrating from legacy , three-tier architectures to newer leaf-spine designs can use our products turnkey . Weve programmed in those use cases so that they can be used out of the box . <p> In the context of leaf-spine designs , we have L3 underlays @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within the rack and across racks . <p> We also have a use case that we support around container networking . If you are building a network that supports containers , where containers are the endpoint , and you want to connect these containers using L3 all the way to the container , then through a combination of agents running on the servers themselves and agents running on the switches , AOS ensures that this connectivity across these containers is indeed delivered on . <p> To recap : leaf-spine , both L3 underlay and L3 underlay with L2 servers on top and then container networking . <p> Who are your customers ? <p> Karam : We have a wide range of customers . I like to say that anyone with a data center can take advantage of our technology . But in terms of the customers that have been early adopters for us , there are three categories : the large enterprises large banks , large financial , large insurance companies . We have telcos , but in the context of the data centers they are building . And then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Can you give me any names of customers in these three categories ? <p> Karam : Were not telling names right now . Hopefully well be able to share names soon . <p> You recently spoke at a panel on disaggregating the data center and that is certainly getting a lot of attention . What do you think of disaggregation ? <p> Karam : When I think of disaggregation , I think of going from what traditionally has been vertically integrated architecture to a horizontally layered architecture . Horizontally layered architecture means you have different components , or different software or devices at each of those layers that are interchangeable , and that you have essentially APIs between those different layers . <p> To me , disaggregation is closely related to abstraction , where by having these APIs you 're abstracting the layer underneath to the layer above so now you can interchange between various components . This is a very powerful concept . It allows customers to really adopt a best-of-breed component approach at those various layers . <p> For example , if you want to deploy switches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you 'll be able to do that . And if you need buffers for storage , you can do that as well . You 're not locked into one specific device or one specific architecture that is the power of disaggregation . <p> For us with Apstra , AOS is leveraging this disaggregation and sitting on top of this infrastructure . AOS is interfacing with devices through the networking operating system on those devices , through these published APIs . <p> For Apstra to succeed , does the network layer have to be open ? Can it succeed if incumbents like Cisco dominate the market ? <p> Karam : We support Cisco today , we leverage their published APIs . We work with both established vendors and newer , more recent vendors . For us , if you look at our 1.2 product , we support Cisco , Arista , Juniper , Cumulus and SnapRoute . We also have agents that run on Ubuntu servers . <p> Looking into your crystal ball : 10 years down the road , where is Apstra ? <p> Karam : When I think of where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few years from now is a world where network engineers are no longer using box-by-box CLI to operate their network . Gartner estimated that 85 percent of networking teams today use CLIs , the primary method to operate their system , but they say that by 2020 , that will go down to 30 percent . And that will result in massive untapped value . <p> As I mentioned , 80 percent of operational costs are spent on manual operations . Were going to get massive efficiencies through intent-based that . We can really unleash the power of the infrastructure and support the needs , the requirements of the business . <p> I read somewhere that there are going to be 50 billion devices connected because of IoT in 2020 just consider how much networking is required . And every organization that wants to participate will have to change their operational model . For us we see so much opportunity in the future with Apstra , and were looking forward to solving customer problems and really getting them to this Nirvana . <p> Taking a step back , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ influencing the industry ? <p> Karam : I think were going to continue seeing programmability , were going to continue seeing a focus on operational efficiency . Were going to see customers wanting diversity and the ability to choose between various equipment because every type of equipment delivers on specific needs , whether its lower latency , or deeper buffers to support storage . <p> I think were going to continue seeing a focus on automation to provide more efficient operations and also providing a hardware-agnostic infrastructure so that operational model continues to be agnostic of the hardware choice underneath . <p> Generally , we live in fascinating times . The power of compute is such that there is so much that can be done . Think of IoT , think of machine learning , what Facebook is trying to do with virtual reality to the masses , self-driving transportation . <p> All of these trends require devices to be interconnected . It requires massive amounts of bandwidth interconnecting all of those devices . And any organization that wants to support or participate in those trends will have to build @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of having the right bandwidth , having the right capacity to support those trends , but also having the right operational model so that they can really scale at the speed of their business . <p> Jessica is a Senior Editor , covering next-generation data centers and security , at SDxCentral .

@@21507719 @1507719/ <p> The solution de-couples the network functions from the physical devices , in a way that is analogous to de-coupling virtual servers ( VMs ) from physical servers . In order to de-couple the new virtual network from the traditional physical network , NSX natively re-creates the traditional network constructs in virtual space these constructs include ports , switches , routers , firewalls , etc . <p> In the past , everyone knew what these things were . It was possible to see and touch the switch port that a server connects to , but now , this is n't possible . Fundamentally , these constructs still exist with VMware NSX , but it is no longer possible to touch them .

For example , Juniper Networks has a module called vRouter , which is part of its Contrail product line , which provides IP-based data forwarding . This can be used to create an IP-based tunnel by encapsulating traffic . This is an approach known as " overlay " in SDN . Cisco markets the Cloud Services Router 1000V series , designed for Wide Area Networking ( WAN ) applications .

This might include VPN , traffic engineering , route reflectors , BGP routing , firewalls , and virtual Customer Premises Equipment ( CPE ) for the WAN .

In the past , these WAN connections often used technology that required special proprietary hardware . The SD-WAN movement seeks to move more of the network control is moved into the " cloud , " using a software approach . <p> Software Defined WAN <h> SD-WAN Business Drivers <p> Enterprise customers are demanding more flexible , open , and cloud-based WAN technologies , rather than installing proprietary or specialized WAN technology that often involve expensive , fixed circuits , or proprietary hardware . <p> Many of the new SD-WAN offerings , for example , can be used to improve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more expensive legacy WAN technologies such as T-1 or MPLS . In some cases , SD-WAN technology uses Internet broadband connections to replace more expensive solutions . Virtualization technology can apply security and virtual private networking ( VPN ) technology to broadband Internet connections , making them more secure . <p> SD-WAN also has the advantage of removing potentially expensive routing hardware by provisioning connectivity and services via the cloud . Emerging SD-WAN technology can also be more flexible . For example , because SD-WAN connectivity can be controlled through cloud software , a customer might be able to scale up or " burst " connectivity during times of peak demand . <h> Customer Focus : Cost , Reliability , Security <p> The main goal of SD-WAN technology is to deliver a business-class , secure , and simple cloud-enabled WAN connection with as much open and software-based technology as possible . This can be used to deliver basic WAN connectivity , or it can be used for premium business services such as VPN , WAN optimization , and applications delivery control ( ADC ) . <p> Many new startups are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is likely billions of dollars . Many of these startups have slightly different approaches to the market .

More than $360 million has been invested in SD-WAN startups , according to Rayno Report research . <p> Incumbent WAN technology vendors such as Cisco and Riverbed , which make specialized appliances for WAN connectivity , are now focusing more on cloud-based WAN offerings in response to this new trend . <p> Expect the trend to accelerate over the next few years .

It can accurately simulate thousands of Ver 1.3.4 and Ver 1.0.0 OpenFlow switches . It supports both of the simulation mode and the emulation mode . In the simulation mode , a real-world open source OpenFlow controller such as NOX , POX , Floodlight , OpenDaylight and Ryu controllers can directly run up on a controller node in the simulated network to control these simulated OpenFlow switches without any modification . In the emulation mode , these controller application programs can run up on an external machine that is different from the machine used to simulate OpenFlow switches to control these simulated OpenFlow switches . In additiion , in the emulation mode , if an OpenFlow controller has been implemented as a dedicated hardware device , it can remotely control the simulated OpenFlow switches in EstiNet 9.0 via an Ethernet cable . <p> EstiNet 9.0 OpenFlow network simulator and emulator simulates the interactions between the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ application programs and the simulated OpenFlow switches accurately , quickly , and repeatably . An OpenFlow researcher can easily and efficiently test his own controller application program on an EstiNet simulated OpenFlow network . He can run up his controller application program on an EstiNet simulated OpenFlow network without any modification ! ( This unique capability is due to the innovative " kernel-reentering simulation methodology " used by EstiNet . ) Comparing other existing OpenFlow simulators and emulators , one will find that EstiNet 9.0 OpenFlow network simulator and emulator is the most accurate , fast , scalable , and useful OpenFlow network simulator and emulator in the world . <p> For example , although Mininet OpenFlow emulator can be used as a rapid prototyping for Software-Defined Networking , it has several serious drawbacks and limitations . As said in its own technical paper published in ACM Hotnets 2010 , the most significant limitation of Mininet is its lack of performance fidelity because it provides no guarantee that a host in Mininet that is ready to send a packet will be scheduled promptly to send the packet and it provides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the same rate . The packet forwarding capability of a switch in Mininet is unpredictable as it depends on the numbers of hosts and switches that must be multiplexed over a CPU in Mininet . As a result , Mininet can only be used to test the behavior of a controller application program but can not be used to accurately study network/application performances ( e.g. , end-to-end achieved throughput or experienced delay ) of a data flow in an OpenFlow network controlled by the controller . <p> In contrast , EstiNet 9.0 , when running in the simulation mode , accurately simulates the properties of the links that connect simulated OpenFlow switches . These properties include link bandwidth , link delay , link downtime , and the medium access control ( MAC ) protocol used over the link ( e.g. , IEEE 802.3 or IEEE 802.11 , etc . ) .

@@21507761 @1507761/ <h> What is Cisco OpenFlow ? <p> Cisco OpenFlow is Ciscos implementation of OpenFlow. - OpenFlow is considered the first software-defined networking ( SDN ) standard , as- an open communications protocol in SDNs that enables the SDN Controller to interact with the forwarding plane ( switches , routers , etc. ) and adapt the network to be responsive to real-time traffic and business requirements . <p> Cisco has also introduced an alternative protocol to OpenFlow , called OpFlex , which was announced at the Interop conference in April 2014 . Seeing limitations in OpenFlow 's approach , Cisco created OpFlex as an alternative . <h> Difference in Cisco OpenFlow and OpFlex Control Plane Approaches <p> There are two main approaches to the SDN control plane on the market right now Imperative and Declarative : <p> Imperative describes a centralized SDN Controller that acts as the brains for the SDN environment ; the controller receives requests from applications , via a northbound application program interface ( API ) , and dictates downstream to the forwarding plane how the switches/routers need to be configured to answer the needs of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to become a bottleneck and a single point of failure in the network , which different implementations attempt to address . <p> Declarative describes a model where the SDN Controller declares what the application needs and sends that message to the network fabric for the switches and routers to determine how to meet the application 's requirements . A declarative control plane allows for more distributed intelligence ; it sets a central policy , but gives power to network nodes to make more decisions about how to execute said policies . <p> OpenFlow supports an Imperative control plane , with no control/intelligence embedded in the data path . Instead , the SDN Controller provides all the instructions to the switches/routers and tells them how to move packets. - OpFlex- supports a Declarative control plane , focusing on centralizing the policy and then pushing out some of the intelligence to the data path . Cisco 's Application Centric Infrastructure ( ACI ) and Application Policy Infrastructure Controller ( APIC ) - support this approach . <p> Like OpenFlow , OpFlex is designed for communications between a central controller and network devices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . While OpenFlow centralizes the network control plane on a controller and can push commands down to OpenFlow enabled network devices . OpFlex centralizes policy control and relies on traditional and distributed network control protocols to push commands down . <h> Cisco 's Conflicted View of OpenFlow <p> Cisco has had a back and forth relationship with OpenFlow , in part due to the dynamic SDN environment and the changing needs of users , working to support both OpenFlow and alternatives . <p> However , OpenFlow limits an SDN Controller 's ability to verify that switch flow tables are configured within the expected rules . Because of the centralized nature of OpenFlow , special care must also be taken to avoid denial of service ( DoS ) in applications . <p> OpFlex may reduce the potential for the SDN Controller to become the bottleneck of the network . The idea is that by pushing out some of the intelligence to the devices , the network can sustain itself if something happens to the SDN Controller , supporting greater resiliency , availability , and scalability. 65695 @qwx265695 65696 @qwx265696 65707 @qwx265707

Build the business case <p> First , decide on the objective . Look beyond the buzz , define your business goals and articulate the value proposition . Look into instances where opportunities can be created by connecting the objects , and determine how the machine data harnessed from different sources ( devices and sensors ) can shrink operating expenses , redefine customer experience , improve efficiency and create insights for timely decisions . <p> For instance , telecom operators with high operating costs have to figure out ways to save on energy bills and logistics expenses .

The table below summarizes some of the benefits of the Internet of Things . <p> Financial Benefits <p> Operating Benefits <p> Customer Benefits <p> New revenue opportunities through new products <p> Reduced downtime due to predictive maintenance through remote asset management <h> 2 . Select the right IoT platform and solution provider <p> Beware of the pitfalls of complexity that come with running multiple systems based on multiple point solutions . Experts recommend partnering with an IoT platform vendor that offers a complete , unified framework for all your IoT requirements . <p> Choose the right partner for introducing IoT into your business model . Many midsized-to-large enterprise software vendors have forayed into the IoT market in recent years , offering IoT products , but few are complete IoT platforms that solve IoT objectives . Without a complete platform , one might have to depend on different partners to develop and market breakthrough IoT products and services . This will increase the complexity and cost of system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offer functional point products " to address monitoring , billing , application development or device management functions , for instance " but lack the comprehensive IoT framework of a unified platform . <p> While choosing the right IoT platform , focus on two critical criteria : open APIs that facilitate seamless integration with your existing third-party systems ; and robust developer tools that accelerate application development . <h> 3 . Build and test <p> The IoT value chain is all about integration , from sensors to edge devices , gateways to enterprise systems and beyond . A major challenge to realizing the full promise of IoT applications is that one system must integrate all components of the IoT value chain . But unlocking the potential from tens of thousands of intelligent things is not easy , due to the diverse protocol and communication standards they require . <p> Building IoT applications from scratch requires a considerable amount of time and resources . An IoT architecture with hundreds of APIs would simplify the task of interoperability among heterogeneous objects . APIs are the key to innovation as they enable developers to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of vertical markets can benefit from this proven architecture . <h> 4 . Deploy <p> The core asset of IoT applications is the sensor data . When the sensors are generating huge amounts of data , analyzing and deriving real-time insights from that data is a major challenge . Prepare your business to handle that magnitude and variety of data as the number of device types and devices might scale in the future . <p> From a functional standpoint , complex algorithms are required to transform the sheer volume of data into business intelligence . A powerful data analytics tool is critical to unlock the data value for day-to-day business decisions . A Hadoop-based big data and analytics module enables you to shape huge volumes of unstructured data generated from diverse data sources for a more agile and predictive business environment . So , it is crucial to go with an IoT platform with big data and analytics capabilities to fuel a data-driven business . <h> 5 . Manage and maintain <p> Stay cool !

Similarly , a smartphone with in-built sensors also acts as a connectivity hub with the ability to interact with the environment and paves the way for myriad applications to be developed . An example : Personal healthcare applications can integrate accelerometers , pedometers and gyroscopes .

@@21507771 @1507771/ <h> Reduce Exposure to Vulnerabilities with Self-Driving Security <p> Security incidents involving zero-day vulnerabilities those dreaded flaws for which no fix is yet available are making headline news . Yet the truth is that zero-day exploits account for only a small fraction of the attacks against production systems . More often than not , major breaches are the result of systems not being up to date with security patches . When hackers discover a vulnerability , they 're able to set up systems that automatically attempt to exploit it . Until recently , there was no analogue automated defense system ; with self-driving security , we can equalize that imbalance . <p> This is a problem that needs solving , urgently . Its astonishing that our industry has n't  addressed this critical flaw with our systems . As consumers , we are accustomed to automated updates to our mobile devices OS and to our browsers , but as admins and operations professionals , we still rely largely on an error-prone and often delayed manual process to update our servers . This leaves us open to attack and as more and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Internet at large become truly alarming . 65698 @qwx265698 <h> SPONSORED <p> The Mirai botnet , for example , exploited known vulnerabilities in thousands of home routers and connected devices to launch a series of massive distributed denial-of-service ( DDoS ) attacks against high-profile websites . Its estimated that there are hundreds of thousands of such vulnerable devices out there still and in many cases , their owners 1 ) would n't know when their devices software had an available update , and 2 ) would n't know how to apply a security patch if one were available . <p> Any delay between when a patch is published and when it is put into production represents a window of opportunity for attackers . Reducing this delay is an essential step toward securing the internet , but even enterprises with dedicated , professional IT security teams often are not equipped to immediately respond to the latest vulnerability . One solution which , while unorthodox , is proving to be effective , is to take the matter out of ITs hands and slam the window of opportunity shut by applying patches and software updates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ safe , effective , and efficient automated updates can be . Confronted by a seemingly never-ending stream of web exploits ranging from cross-site scripting to header injection , session hijacking , and beyond Google , Mozilla , and others realized that the only way to keep browser users safe is to make the browser patch itself and lift the burden off of the user . <p> Traditional IT admins may balk at this concept , at least initially . We 've all heard stories of a faulty patch leading to downtime for mission-critical systems . Long-standing practices dictate that no patch can be installed before its thoroughly tested and vetted by the security team . But when implemented in a rational , well-thought-out way , automated updates are really the best way forward in todays IT landscape , for a number of reasons : <p> Automatic updates close a hackers window of opportunity . It ca n't be stressed enough that when it comes to security , time is critical . The moment a vulnerability is identified or when a patch is published , the whole world is effectively made aware that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hackers will leap on that opportunity . With automatic updates your infrastructure is patched as soon as the fix is available , closing the gap of time for a hacker to take advantage of the vulnerability . <p> Automatic updates enable scale . Updating a handful of servers manually may be feasible . But todays IT organizations are increasingly turning to high-volume , scaled-out infrastructure that 's partly modeled after the " hyper-scale " web companies . Even with a patch automation system , rolling out patches to hundreds or thousands of systems from a centralized source can be cumbersome . With automated updates , this process no longer requires manual intervention to successfully complete . <p> Automatic updates are admin-friendly . IT automation is n't about putting people out of work . Its about becoming more efficient , which frees up IT staff to concentrate on projects that create value for the organization rather than focusing on the rote drudgery of systems maintenance . Whether updates are automatically initiated or not , the automation of updates eliminates the technical debt typically associated with the manual process , introducing these efficiencies . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always a possibility , but automatic updating does n't  mean flying blind . In the self-driving security model , as with modern web browsers , multiple release channels give admins time to test patches in beta before deploying them on a large scale . In the worst-case scenario , rollback mechanisms are available to undo a defective patch until a replacement arrives . <p> Automatic updates are critical and are here now . Self-driving security is feasible today because IT infrastructure itself has evolved . Containerization , for example , separates application dependencies from the underlying OS , making it easier to update the OS without disturbing the applications or to update one application without disturbing the others . IT and security teams should embrace these and other modern data center technologies to help reduce the security risks inherent in legacy IT systems and processes . <p> Ultimately , securing the Internet is a responsibility we all share . Operating un-patched , vulnerable systems does n't  just threaten your organizations own security . Your vulnerable systems could also be used to launch an attack against mine , and vice versa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being challenged by attacks of ever-increasing sophistication . The only way to beat this game of whack-a-mole is to swing a faster mallet and that 's how automatic updating reduces exposure to vulnerabilities . <p> Its time to get past the idea that automatic updates are risky , or that they ca n't be applied effectively . With the pace of attacks accelerating , this outmoded way of thinking is fast becoming a non-starter . Its the toughest problems that cry loudest for innovation . Security is a bear of a problem for all of us , and its time for more companies to take up the challenge , and make sure they have the best security practices in place to do their part in securing the Internet overall . 65700 @qwx265700 65704 @qwx265704 65708 @qwx265708 65706 @qwx265706 <p> Alex Polvi is co-founder and CEO of CoreOS , Inc. , the creator of self-driving infrastructure .

However , the Achilles ' heel for these operators is to move from limited trials to full scale operationalization. - One of the major causes for lack of full scale operationalization is the operators shortcoming with their existing network management and siloed operations support systems ( OSS ) , which limits their ability to effectively fulfill and assure services in a hybrid environment .

When the worlds largest public cloud provider literally came crashing down for over six hours in the middle of the workweek , the global tremors are felt far and wide . <p> But the " what " of the S3 outage is old news at this point . The more pressing issue is How ? How does one explain the most connected , sophisticated , and automated software and services engine in the world going down for hours on end ? That question is haunting not only the Azures and Googles of the world but the large private clouds and on-premises enterprise data centers as well . They are asking , " if it could happen to them , why not us ? " But maybe I am reaching . Maybe this was a unique AWS occurrence . Either way , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breathe easy now , right ? Wrong ! 65698 @qwx265698 <h> SPONSORED <p> This is the official explanation from AWS as published in their post-mortem . " An authorized S3 team member using an established playbook executed a command which was intended to remove a small number of servers for one of the S3 subsystems that is used by the S3 billing process . Unfortunately , one of the inputs to the command was entered incorrectly and a larger set of servers was removed than intended " . <p> In other words , instead of removing one server , they removed hundreds of servers . Couldnt this happen anywhere ? Could it not happen to other infrastructure components in data centers , such as virtual machines or containers , as well ? And could it not happen anywhere public cloud , private cloud , and on-premise data centers ? The answer to all of these questions is a resounding yes , and that should scare you . <p> Going forward we will be led to believe that the AWS machine will improve by leaps and bounds and will recover from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every private cloud and enterprise IT data center owner needs to look at this as a wake up call and put into practice some simple yet meaningful mechanisms that would go a long way in preventing similar disasters from befalling them . These are scope , control , and governance model . <p> Scope calls for a realistic guide to what each administrator is capable of doing at all times and ensuring that this is always within the bounds of what is acceptable . In the AWS case for instance , the scope could have been that an administrator can only work on 10 servers at a time . But what if the work legitimately requires work on more than 10 ? That 's where control comes in . <p> Control is the ability to have oversight on critical operations . With the AWS incident , it would require as an example approval from a higher authority if 100 servers needed to be acted upon all at once . In other words , trust but verify. <p> And finally , you need a governance model . This is really the implementation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ above two functions scope overview and control enforcement in a self-driven fashion . In this particular example , the policy would be to ensure that the number of servers an admin can operate remains under 10 ( scope ) , and that any increase in that number automatically requires a managers approval ( control ) . Further sophistication can easily be built in , where the manager could easily be a bot that checks the type of workloads and the load on the system and approves ( or denies ) the request . Bottomline checks and balances . <p> There are a lot of scaremongers out there talking up the S3 outage as the demise of public cloud and a sign of how unreliable AWS is , but do n't  get taken in by that . This can happen anywhere , and to anyone . The biggest takeaway should be ( besides being glad it did n't  happen to your infrastructure ) ways to learn from this event and move forward to live another day . 65700 @qwx265700 65704 @qwx265704 65708 @qwx265708 65706 @qwx265706 <p> Ashwin Krishnan is SVP , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

They include storage units , servers , virtualization monitoring , and networking software . Businesses have greatly benefited from adopting cloud services. - Here are 10 reasons businesses should shift to the cloud . <p> 1 . Cost-efficient:Cloud computing eliminates the high cost of hardware , and you can opt for a subscription-based model that suits your budget . It provides the ability to pay for exactly what you need rather than having to pay for unused services . Setting up the system is also an inexpensive affair . <p> 2 . Increased collaboration:Cloud- allows your business 's team to access , edit , and share documents and data with each other from any location , anytime . Productivity and efficiency drastically improve when the business supports collaboration. - This includes- real-time updates through cloud-based workflow and file-sharing apps . <p> 3 . Seamless integration : There has since been a shift from siloed applications . Businesses prefer an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It offers a common platform for integration such as infrastructure services , data management , and development . <p> 4 . Promotes scalability : Every business will experience changes within itself " it will either expand , cut-down , or witness seasonal changes . Cloud has the ability to accommodate and respond to such changes . This promotes scalability and allows the company to grow as and when it needs . You do n't have to constantly change software whenever you want to scale up or down . <p> 5 . Offers great user-control : Employees can now carry their own devices instead of relying on those provided by the IT department . This offers remarkable user control , at whose heart lies Active Directory , which is the foundation for personalization , - compliance , and security of data. - This empowers users to value and learn from data insights within the business . <p> 6 . Tension-free software maintenance : All your servers will be off-premises , and youll- be working on a virtual infrastructure . Whenever there is a new update of software , cloud service providers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stays upgraded at all times . This makes sure that the system is functioning smoothly without lagging behind . You wo n't have to spend any time and energy on maintaining software " - you can rather spend time on other critical business matters . <p> 7 . Great speed : The time taken to commission , implement , and configure cloud services is just a few hours , whereas the same would have taken a few weeks for similar services that need local servers and equipment to set up . The turnaround time is also quick . Replacing virtual desktops and solving virtualization problems is almost immediate and does n't take weeks , as it normally would . <p> 8 . High flexibility : Cloud offers immense flexibility and enables employees to work from anywhere . They no longer have to be restricted to their workstations to access information and execute tasks . The presence of virtual desktop infrastructure ( VDI ) allows the IT environment to be fluid and respond to changes quickly . Additionally , you can enjoy the ability to make rapid changes to marketing campaigns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enables companies to adapt and deliver the right services to their customers at the right time . <p> 9 . Big data : Big data is obtained by collating multiple strands of information from several sources . This data is then analyzed through the analytical tools of the cloud . This helps business managers in learning and understanding information about their customers . The big data analytical techniques can be used to quickly deliver more detailed data about any business area . <p> 10 . High security : Cloud is generally more secure- than on-premises infrastructure . Cloud makes sure that none of your data is vulnerable to those who are n't authorized and protects it from hackers and similar security threats . You can even remotely wipe data from lost laptops so that important business details do n't fall into the wrong hands . <p> A successful implementation is extremely crucial for realizing the benefits of cloud and its infrastructure .

@@21507797 @1507797/ <p> The onslaught against Intels hegemony in the market for data center servers has begun in earnest , with Microsoft leading the charge . Microsoft is going to start populating its data centers with servers based on Qualcomms new Centriq 2400 processor , Qualcomm and Microsoft announced today . <h> SPONSORED <p> In addition to its announcement with Qualcomm , Microsoft issued joint releases regarding SONiC with a set of other companies , including Cavium , Mellanox , and Centec . <p> Part of the announcement with Qualcomm is that Qualcomm has joined the Open Compute Project ( OCP ) . OCP is the home for the SONiC project . All of these announcements were made at the annual OCP conference being held this week . <p> Qualcomm and Microsoft said their collaboration in data center technology is going to be a long-term relationship . Qualcomm and Microsoft seem to be aligning their orbits with each other . The two said they have been working together on using the ARM architecture for years . <p> In December , the two said they will partner on helping Qualcomms ARM-based Snapdragon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collaboration is basically about enabling mobile devices ( from smartphones to tablets ) to behave more like PCs . <h> Aligned Against Intel <p> The new data center server collaboration is all about grabbing market share from Intel . Intel owns well over 90 percent of the data server market , a dominance based in part on familiarity programmers are thoroughly acquainted with Intel processors based on Intels x86 architecture . Intel solidified its lead in server ICs when it introduced a 48-core version of its x86-based Xeon chips , designed using newer finFET technology and processed at the 14nm node . <p> Power consumption in data centers is enormous , and the management of power is literally critical . The x86 architecture is practically ancient , with roots in the late 70s , a time when power management was a secondary consideration . If Intel has a weakness in the server IC market , it might be that the adaptation of x86 circuitry to applications where power management is paramount has been fitful . That 's the knock on the x86 architecture , anyway . <h> Qualcomm and ARM <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chips for communications products , including smartphones , a low-power application notable for having strict power management requirements . Qualcomm has been basing its communications processors on the ARM architecture ( as have many other suppliers to the smartphone market ) in part because ARM was designed with low-power applications in mind . <p> There are several proposed advantages to using ARM , but Intels would-be competitors have long argued that an ARM-based alternative might thrive in the market for data center server processors in large part because of its inherent facility with power management . <p> For the last year or more , Qualcomm has been explicit about its intention to compete with Intel in the server market , and in December it started sampling its ARM-based Centriq 2400 , also a 48-core processor , also using finFET technology . The unexpected twist was that the Centriq is being fabricated at the 10nm node , the current state of the art . It appears to be the first server processor fabricated at 10nm ( other types of ICs have previously been built at 10nm ) . <p> Traditionally , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a set of performance improvements . An IC fabricated at 10nm might be expected to outperform an IC built at the 14nm node . But as IC manufacturers push the very edge of device physics at these smallest possible design rules 14nm , 10nm , and soon enough 7 nm its not entirely clear that that rule still strictly applies . <p> Microsoft and Qualcomm trumpeted that their server partnership will " accelerate cloudservices " the reference explicitly being Microsofts Azure cloud service . But neither company provided details , including performance details . In fact , Qualcomm is n't going to disclose any performance measures of either the Centriq 2400 or servers based on it until " a later point in the year , " a Qualcomm spokesman told SDxCentral . <p> Until then , there will be no way to tell if an ARM-based processor has any significant performance advantage over an x86 product . But ARM might have another advantage inasmuch as its an open technology . <p> This is an argument that is hard to parse for a lot of reasons , some of which border on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is defeat vendor lock . Anyone can use the basic technology , and anybody can modify it as needs be . By joining the OCP , Qualcomm is making it easier for any OEM to build servers based on the Centriq . That could also serve to widen the market for Centriq-based data center servers . Again , this is in the context of SONiC . <h> More SONiC Support <p> Cavium today said it will support SONiC on its XPliant Ethernet switches ; at the OCP conference . Cavium is demonstrating its switch running on a 100-Gb/s Ethernet network platform built by Edgecore Networks . <p> Centec said it will support SONiC with its 10- Gb/s white box switches . And Mellanox announced its Spectrum switches will support SONiC ; the Spectrum line supports connections at 10-Gb/s , 25-Gb/s , 40-Gb/s , 50-Gb/s and 100-Gb/s . <p> The potential downside of open systems is that since anyone can modify an open system , an open system environment can end up bordering on ( relative ) chaos . That 's the knock on the vast ARM environment anyway . <p> Making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ server IC market , late last year Intel became an ARM licensee . That seems to have been a maneuver mainly to support its contract manufacturing business , but that 's part of the murk . <p> Brian Santo has been writing about science and technology for over 30 years for a number of organizations including EE Times , IEEE Spectrum , SNL Kagan , and Light Reading .

@@21507808 @1507808/ <h> How to Make the Most of SDN <p> When I 've talked with communication service providers about software-defined networking ( SDN ) , most seem well aware of its value to their business . But not everyone recognizes that a new approach to service assurance is crucial for gaining the full advantage of their dynamic new networks . <p> As operators move from trials to broad commercialization of new SDN services , they quickly realize that in addition to the base SDN capabilities marketed by most vendors today , they also need a way to keep their networks and services performing at their best and their customers happy in this new shifting , ever-changing network environment . The solution lies in combining network service assurance with SDN . <h> SPONSORED <p> The first part is relatively straightforward getting the insight you need by ensuring the assurance tools you use today can work over multi-vendor SDN environments . The second part is where the magic happens using this data to drive automatic changes to the network whenever a dynamic response is needed . In other words , the key performance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know and love are used to trigger assurance policies in carrier SDN controllers . These in turn make automatic changes to the network to ensure customer expectations are always met , and the network infrastructure keeps running at peak efficiency . <p> Heres what you need to know as you consider service assurance for your carrier SDN projects : <h> Get Broad Network Visibility In Near Real Time <p> Make sure to leverage telemetry to collect data across the multiple network domains supported by SDN , including IP , optical , virtual , and physical . This broad , real-time visibility into your entire network will allow you to quickly identify potential problems , before they impact services . <h> Ensure Actions Can Be Triggered Automatically <p> Adding service assurance to carrier SDN does more than give operators enhanced insight into whether new SDN services are operating at their best . It also allows assurance capabilities to become a more dynamic , automated part of the service fulfillment process . Make sure assurance data can be used to trigger automated changes to the network through SDN control , so you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assurance . <p> At the services layer , automated actions can be launched to ensure that critical service level agreements ( SLAs ) are met . At the network layer , they can be targeted at making better use of network assets while providing better overall services levels for customers . <p> And finally , make sure that a broad set of automatic network actions are supported . Common actions in your dynamic assurance toolkit should include automatic redirection of traffic flows , the establishment of new IP/optical paths , or the dynamic resizing of existing IP/optical paths . <h> Determine the Pain Points You Want to Address <p> You can leverage integrated service assurance to address a variety of goals and issues . For example , one of our incumbent service provider customers wanted to deliver a premium , on-demand bandwidth service that would place bandwidth wherever it was needed to avoid service degradation . Link utilization KPIs were used to dynamically resize paths at the IP/optical layer to meet changing needs . <p> Another service provider recognized that integrated service assurance could provide highly intelligent and self-tuned load @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public and private data centers . They now track congestion and latency through data center links and peering points and dynamically redirect selected flows to avoid congestion and ensure high customer satisfaction . <h> How to Get Started with Automated Assurance ? <p> Once you have identified the pain point you want to address , begin by studying assurance data to identify events that require operator intervention on a regular basis . You can then write policies to automate these changes , using assurance data as the trigger . Track the policies to ensure they were successful at providing the desired result . <p> Once you start building trust in these new automated assurance processes , I guarantee you will never look back . Youll have fast , economical ways to maintain high performance and efficiency as you roll out new revenue-generating SDN services .

This will give the San Jose , California-based startup its first chance to see if its 1U appliances really work in full-scale production environments . <h> SPONSORED <p> Diamanti is n't a container startup per se ; the D10 is supplied with the Docker container runtime and Kubernetes orchestration .

The transition from traditional network architectures to those built on virtualized network functions and network controllers will be a long journey , but it is one that promises a windfall of benefits for CSPs , MNOs and their customers . 65698 @qwx265698 <h> SPONSORED <p> Despite the appeal of NFV and SDN , their widespread and immediate adoption still face an uphill battle , because network technologies will become increasingly complex and NaaS offers will need a new generation of network architectures and OSS platforms . At the end of the day , even if CSP customers find benefits in new technology , they primarily want reliable services , at the right price , supported by strong SLAs . New technology can not be adopted at the expense of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ partners , and if customers do notice a disruption in service , whether its problems with speed , reliability or lack of agility , they could seek to renegotiate their contracts as soon as possible , or possibly turn to a competitor . <p> To avoid these circumstances , CSPs need to begin preparing now , by taking certain measures and trialing the technology needed to transition to this new virtualized environment . <h> A New Service Environment <p> The first step for innovative CSPs transitioning to an NFV or SDN-enabled environment is to put in place modern service level management ( SLM ) solutions to assure customers service levels . Once these solutions have been adopted and CSPs have adopted a new , future-proofed , unified end-to-end approach to service assurance and network performance , the next era of increasing network agility and configuration automation can begin . <p> With comprehensive performance visibility , CSPs operations teams will be able to monitor , measure , discover , correlate and visualize tomorrows networks in parallel with existing WAN infrastructure . This allows them to deliver high QoS and fulfill customers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> And , despite the difficulty of monitoring dynamic networks that comprise both physical and virtual elements , CSPs have been meeting this service assurance challenge . As the level of network automation continues to increase , CSPs can improve their management processes , smoothly transition to virtualized environments and evolve their network infrastructure by following these five pragmatic steps : <h> 1 . Managing virtualized network functions ( VNFs ) <p> Since virtualization obstructs CSPs network visibility , the only way to see how these functions are actually performing is through performance assurance statistics , made available in VNFs by accessing devices directly or through vendor element management systems ( EMS ) . As VNFs are rolled out , CSPs must add real-time , on-demand performance-monitoring capabilities to their OSS and make sure their operations teams network management toolset is agnostic from the virtualization layers . At the end of the day , SOC and NOC engineers should not be concerned about a network function being virtual or physical . Instead , they should be provided with solutions that allow them to understand the performance of each network function @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CSPs migrate physical network functions to a multitude of distributed and specialized NFVI , engineering teams will need to troubleshoot the underlying telco cloud infrastructure introduced in their networks . And , as with every distributed and multi-vendor environment , this will require a higher level of troubleshooting capabilities . In addition , CSPs should ensure that orchestrators are publishing inventory information about the network functions they are hosting , as well as statistics about the physical architecture that supports those functions . <h> 3 . Scaling VNFs <p> As the number of VNFs grow and network agility increases , capacity reporting and NFV framework capacity management capabilities will become critical . Virtualization places immense stress on the back end of a network infrastructure because , as the network evolves , new and old systems must integrate together seamlessly . The pieces wont always magically fit together they need to be properly monitored and managed as VNFs scale . <h> 4 . Enabling " Networking as a Service " <p> Many network controllers are focusing on automating device configuration , but reliable NaaS will only be made possible when controllers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of their decision-making process . After gaining access to these performance metrics , CSPs can make more informed decisions to ensure that end-to-end service quality is not impacted by configuration changes dictated by siloed and automated optimizations process . <h> 5 . Assuring SDN and WAN infrastructure <p> Today , most management networks are not fully assured that needs to change in order to ensure that the entire telecom infrastructure operates properly . As an example , a network controller requires a control plane to send commands to equipment . By assuring availability of all NaaS technology introduced in their networks , CSPs can ensure that new NaaS architecture and all its components are performing and able to support future service growth . <h> The Path to Success <p> To maintain a consistently high QoS for customers in the face of growing virtualization , unified service performance assurance is critical . While the migration to NFV- and SDN-based services seems daunting , CSPs that take the time to upgrade their service assurance solutions will allow their operation and engineer teams to successfully manage these functions and make the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stages of virtualization through to the management of an entire SDN architecture , service assurance functions are evolving to be part of the strategic arsenal of CSPs. 65700 @qwx265700 65704 @qwx265704 65708 @qwx265708 65706 @qwx265706 <p> Cyril has 17 years of experience in the telecom and financial software industries .

Ideally , this flexibility shouldnt add complexity .

You can find more examples of the types of tools available to help you automate the provisioning and management of your data center in SDxCentrals The Rise of DevOps Report . <p> Security Ensuring effective controls are implemented to protect your resources and support your adherence to appropriate regulations . The solutions should have robust security measures in place ( both physical and virtual , as well as within the hardware and software that make up the solution ) to protect the privacy and integrity of all your communications and data .

It ends up involving " a lot of soft skills , a lot of teamwork , " he said . <h> SPONSORED <p> A serverless function is one that has no permanent home in the cloud . Rather , its called up spontaneously after a trigger event . For example , every time a photo is saved into storage , a serverless function could create a thumbnail version . <p> In each case , you do n't  have prior access to the infrastructure your function will run on .

Can an IWAN customer locked into proprietary hardware integrate this new HW solution to take advantage of virtual spin up of remote branch capabilities ? Or are these two separate offerings and never the two shall meet ? Also , while this new enhancement allows remote branches to spin up routing , Security , WAN optimization , the offerings are limited to Cisco only Im assuming ? That seems very limiting when one considers the true value of open , virtual scenarios.being able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no ? <p> Hi Mike , the virtual ISR , ISRv , contains all of the IWAN functionality that you get with a physical ISR . If you are an existing ISR customer with UCSE blade then you can run our Enterprise NFV software on the UCSE blade and spin up virtual network functions as needed . Cisco plans to announce support for 3rd party VNFs later this year for customers that would like to build a best of breed solution . <p> Hi Mike , This question would be better directed to Cisco than to me . But I did ask Ghodgaonkar about IWAN and Ciscos existing SD-WAN solution , and he said " There 's SD-WAN capabilities there , same that we have . We 're hearing it 's one thing from a connectivity standpoint , but it 's the additional services on top . " So it sounds to me as if branch offices will need the more advanced hardware if they want more services . <p> Cisco 's Secure Agile Exchange ( SAE ) enables enterprises to quickly and securely interconnect users to applications by virtualizing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crossroads of internet traffic . It allows users " employees , customers and partners to reach the desired application whether the application resides in the data center , the public or SaaS cloud while ensuring the best application experience .

@@21507873 @1507873/ <h> What Went Wrong On Our ( Too ) Long Journey to Open Networks ? <p> In 2012 , an executive who worked for one of the largest European service providers shared his dream with the attendees of Layer123s first software-defined networking ( SDN ) &amp; OpenFlow World Congress in Darmstadt , Germany . According to him , the reason for all the misery in carrier-land were not permanent price battles , flat-rates , and cut-through competition ; it was us , the vendors . We were accused of only offering hardware that was too expensive and was n't interoperable forcing carriers to pay much more than necessary . The audience was impressed especially when we were asked to collaborate , define common interfaces , agree on one communication language , and offer open , fully programmable boxes based on standard industry architectures to drive his cost down as much as possible . For the majority of the audience , this might have been the first time when they were confronted with the realities of the new , open world . Since then , the world keeps on changing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) vendors are still alive . But OpenFlow , the savior of that day , is virtually dead . What went wrong ? <p> Well , quite a bit . It took a while , but people close to the matter realized that even after several massive iterations , OpenFlow would never be powerful enough for managing a dense wave division multiplexing ( DWDM ) system , let alone something as complex as a packet-optical transport system ( P-OTS ) or an optical transport network ( OTN ) switch . This did n't  stop some vendors from claiming that their transport solutions are fully compatible with this not so powerful language , so a lot of confusion was injected into our industry , but in reality it never worked . The idea of one powerful controller , to control all network items , only worked in theory since it would hamper operations substantially due to the readily available compute power and lack of common standards . Over time , the dream of one language , one central controller , and flat , programmable networks became a playing field for marketing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new messiah , went down from being the Holy Grail to becoming the next version of network management systems ( NMS ) . Element management systems ( EMSs ) are called Domain Controllers , NMSs are Parent Controllers and Umbrella Network Managements ( remember those ? ) are called orchestrators. 65698 @qwx265698 <h> SPONSORED <p> Meanwhile network functions virtualization ( NFV ) had entered the stage , and with it several competing " open " standards , which ( you 've guessed it ) do n't  interwork . And management and orchestration ( MANO ) was introduced as an alternative sort-of NMS for the NFV world , of course alongside the above mentioned SDN crowd . And even the formerly well-organized and well-tranched operations support systems ( OSS ) /business support systems ( BSS ) layer is whirled around with lifecycle service orchestration ( LSO ) initiatives . The lowest common denominator appears to be YANG and ( not YING ) network configuration protocol ( NETCONF ) . As long as a vendor shows those magic terms in the middle of his overloaded network-diagrams , operators have at least a glimmer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good solution for evolving their networks going forward . So what went wrong ? <p> Well , a bit . The biggest mistake we as an industry made was starting the network-revolution at box level . Remember the structure of networks ? The higher up you go , the more unified they become . That 's what Northbound interfaces are made for , and even 20 years ago , those were sort of standardized . The further down you go , the more proprietary all solutions become . All network vendors are using different languages for communicating with their boxes , and the way packet networks are managed ca n't be applied to transport networks . Maybe someday , but not today . Something like simple network management protocol ( SNMP ) never made it to the optical camp , for the same reason why OpenFlow got stuck physics are complex , and this was ignored completely . <p> So wheres the way out ? We might have already found it , its just not as nice as some people want it to be . Packet networks were always more uniform @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ centers , and some of their nodes actually talk OpenFlow . Optical transport networks can be managed via domain controllers , and YING and YANG will do the rest . Are there real benefits ? Yes , as soon as we manage to bring the right capabilities to the parent controllers , as soon as they will start talking to orchestrators that control data centers as well , innovative end-end services can be defined and turned up faster than ever , networks can be optimized in a way that was never there before , and automation will take control to improve operations .

@@21507892 @1507892/ <h> SD-WAN Needs to Iron Out Some Wrinkles <p> Software-defined wide area networking ( SD-WAN ) took off in 2016 as enterprise IT people realized they could save lots of money using the technology . The math is pretty straightforward : Eliminate some expensive MPLS connections , replace them with cheaper broadband connections , and manage it all with SD-WAN software . <p> It makes for an easy and convincing sales pitch . So , not surprisingly , lots of vendors have materialized to offer SD-WAN . <h> SPONSORED <p> However , some issues have arisen pertaining to the nascent technology . A couple of wrinkles include the complexity of establishing broadband contracts with myriad providers and the need to include the cloud in branch office networking . <h> Contracts With Broadband Providers <p> If a company wants to manage all its branch offices with SD-WAN , it needs to corral all the contracts with the various broadband providers that are supplying the connections to those offices . Then , the SD-WAN can centrally manage the connections . <p> Gary Sevounts , Aryakas chief marketing officer , says , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ providers . They become service providers themselves . " <p> In some cases , traditional service providers such as CenturyLink are creating connectivity agreements with other service providers , saving their customers from having to do this . And that could turn out to be a good thing for CenturyLink , allowing it to expand its footprint beyond its own regions . <p> But for global enterprises wanting to use SD-WAN , or for global service providers offering SD-WAN , that entails a lot of work . <p> John Isch , a practice director at Orange Business Services , says , " Customers are n't  looking to create contractual relationships with ISPs for each of their locations globally . A key element of Oranges hybrid network solutions is our ability to source business-quality local ISP services in over 100 countries globally all on one contract with the customer . " <p> For its part , Aryaka stresses the international aspect of its SD-WAN , which is built on a global private network that the company put together by buying Layer 2 capacity from Tier 1 and Tier 2 service providers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of presence ( PoPs ) across North America . TELoIPs Founder and CTO Pat Saavedras original vision was basically that of a service provider . He wanted to create technology to deliver voice , video , and data over the Internet . " It did n't  take long to recognize we needed multiple and diverse connections , " Saavedra says . The company now sells a multitenant , multi-PoP overlay SD-WAN network . <p> But for those vendors that do n't  have PoPs , they may be sticking their customers with a big task to wrangle all those broadband contracts . <h> Its Getting Cloudy <p> Many of the startups that are peddling SD-WAN created their technologies to help enterprises save money on private branch connections . But now , some vendors are saying its crucial for SD-WAN to connect to the cloud . <p> " Most SD-WAN startups are like-for-like replacements of existing VPNs , " says Nuages founder and CEO , Sunil Khandekar . " But our premise is : the nature of connectivity itself is changing because of the cloud . Do n't  just connect branches together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Nuage ( which is owned by Nokia ) , the key is using a single network policy framework that distributes business policies across both the WAN and the data center . For example , with Nuages SD-WAN , branches can securely connect to workloads in a public cloud such as Amazon Web Services ( AWS ) . And the SD-WAN will enforce the same uniform policies for all branches . <p> CloudGenix also added functionality to its SD-WAN so that remote offices can access applications in the data center . The vendors customers say they want to specify an application policy for performance , security , and compliance . And they want to have it delivered from the data center or the cloud , across the WAN , to the remote office . <p> The vendor 128 Technology does n't  even like the term " WAN .

" <p> By different parties , he s referring to all the different data centers and networks that enterprise application traffic might traverse . The traffic may start in a private network but then travel to a variety of other private and public networks , before terminating in the private network . <p> Even though the company offers a more efficient and economical way for branch offices to connect to each other , it does n't  call its service " SD-WAN . " Its more focused on creating an end-to-end policy control for a service . <p> Juniper Networks also identified the importance of the cloud to branch offices , and was forward-thinking enough to name its SD-WAN technology " Cloud-Enabled Branch ( CEB ) . " CEB manages branch connections securely . And branches can deploy applications and services from the cloud via an open platform for third party services . <p> Any SD-WAN vendors that failed to consider the impact of the cloud may need to do some more engineering in 2017. 65702 @qwx265702 65697 @qwx265697 65699 @qwx265699 65695 @qwx265695 65696 @qwx265696 65707 @qwx265707

@@21507911 @1507911/ <h> Are You Driving Your WAN ? Learn to Embrace SDN <p> IP networks originated as private networks to handle data . IP then migrated to a carrier construct , again specifically for data transmission , often encapsulated within asynchronous transfer mode ( ATM ) . As IP networks expanded , costs were significantly reduced ; to the point that real-time applications including voice and video began moving to IP transport , using proprietary protocols . Standards-based IP protocols for voice over IP ( VoIP ) were then created by the International Engineering Task Force ( IETF ) , International Telecommunication Union ( ITU ) , 3GPP , etc. and IP quickly became the choice for enterprises and carriers ( IP multimedia subsystem ( IMS ) /multimedia domain ( MMD ) ) . <p> In the beginning , the quality of VoIP was akin to poor cellular service . Overlay mechanisms were created to create classes of service to prioritize real-time traffic ( resource reservation protocol ( RSVP ) , IP Precedence , MPLS ) . Other overlay mechanisms were created to add security ( Internet protocol security ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ layer security ( TLS ) ) and extend LAN functionality ( **25;326;TOOLONG wide area networking ( SD-WAN ) to remote locations . More and more overhead to shape traffic ; to make traffic behave within the specification of the applications , with the inevitable outcome of burdening the network and literally ( overall ) slowing things down , and we did n't  include things like load balancers and session border controllers . 65698 @qwx265698 <h> SPONSORED <p> Add more devices , multiplying security threats , huge growth in data , lack of control granularity especially at the edge , multiple systems to coordinate and administer , and the constant user demand for quality of service ( QoS ) regardless of the location and available services . Yet , we have todays network hard to manage , provision , and secure . The idea of throwing bandwidth at everything to solve issues is not efficient or secure and quite often only masks , and sometimes magnifies , the underlying issue(s) . <p> In IP there is also a problem that relates to applications over IP networks being able to handle " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real-time applications like VoIP and video . This is known as the Two Generals problem , a thought experiment meant to illustrate the pitfalls and design challenges of attempting to coordinate an action by communicating over an unreliable link . It further shows that even though transmission control protocol ( TCP ) /IP is a stateful protocol , because of the current underlying network construct , it ca n't guarantee state consistency between endpoints . <p> Within the LAN , enterprises can address these concerns ; enterprises have control and are able to " tune " their LAN to properly handle the applications used . The WAN is another matter ; WANs are typically not controlled by the enterprise and are not specifically tuned for their applications set . This leads to inefficiencies and lack of flexibility . In addition , carriers offer little visibility , especially past carrier meet-point ingress/egress . Security concerns are rampant , and no holistic approach has been offered . Enterprises do not drive the WAN . <p> The amazing news ? We can address these issues without forklift upgrades or massive changes to our current @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ network , i.e. , there are many paths to each destination . Todays routers do not take advantage of this built-in capability . A router today makes a judgment , based on the type of traffic its told its sending , and routes it over the best single-path available at that point in time . Two minutes later , that route may have changed to be the worst possible route , and that session or call may fail or drop completely . So , we need a technology that utilizes the multi-path nature of the fully meshed network . By doing so , we actually address the Two Generals problem mentioned previously ; using a multi-path technology the " state " of the session is constantly refreshed . In addition , with proper multi-path management router failures , slowdowns can be avoided . <p> Second , IP can take many forms : satellite , fiber , cat5 , coax cable , wireless , or dial-up . There is an inherent advantage of having multiple Internet service providers ( ISPs ) ( resiliency and redundancy ) if the solution is implemented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a choice of sending some bits down one path and some down another , or segregating traffic to where some applications always take one route and other applications take the other . Bonding is n't the solution . True aggregation or inverse multiplexing is a much better approach all bandwidth is aggregated into one logical pipe , and if a ISP goes down , the size of the pipe shrinks appropriately . By having multiple ISPs , even with basic broadband connections 5-9s uptime can be achieved . <p> Third , security is now a major concern in IP networks . Every technology in the market today has been hacked , it is only a matter of time . Multi-path technology also addresses security . By using multiple protocols , encrypting each path , continually rolling these paths , adding red herring information , and using byte slicing techniques , a puzzle can be created that is beyond the desire of hackers to penetrate , and they will seek easier targets . <p> What else do software-defined networking ( SDN ) networks offer ? Depending on the market positioning of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the offered solution , and these additional pieces are very key . For example , if a carrier were to deploy SDN , they can include a cloud network element that will manage the multi-path routing through " deflects " and will hide both originating and destination IP addresses . This is a very important security piece ; since the middle of the network is now the entire cloud , and the attack surface has been shifted to the cloud-based deflect elements , distributed denial of service ( DDoS ) , and man-in-the-middle attacks can be basically eliminated . <p> More is needed . No fork-lift upgrades , no more proprietary " boxes . " True SDN will be provided as software running on standard servers or virtualized only . The addition of SDN will be in a non-disruptive manner to allow partners to move as quickly or as slowly as their need determines . All current systems will be unaffected by the additions of SDN . Whether or not all these systems will be needed after implementing SDN , will be a decision that can be made at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well in implementation objectives . Both Layer 2 and layer 3 products should be available to address all possible scenarios and when used in conjunction can address not only major location connectivity , but also connectivity for road-warriors , work-at-home , the Internet of Things ( IoT ) , and supervisory control and data acquisition ( SCADA ) . This ensures a holistic approach the SDN offering must have options for office locations and individual devices . <p> Graphic provided by author <p> Let 's take one more look at some additional benefits SDN can offer : Session performance can now be managed all the way to the edge , even a traveling edge , regardless of carrier meet-point , while maintaining centralized policy and administration . QoS , lower latency and jitter across all applications , and increased throughput and uptime can now be provided to all users regardless of location . 65700 @qwx265700 65704 @qwx265704 65708 @qwx265708 65706 @qwx265706 <p> Mr. Hoefgen has been involved with high-tech and new product introduction over 25 years .

They decided instead to tackle the issue for networks in general . The company has now grown to 22 employees and raised $11.5 million , most of it from a venture funding round in 2014 that includes Andreessen-Horowitz ( but was raised before Casado joined the VC firm ) . <h> One Click Away From Disaster <p> Part of what makes the network so complex is the diversity of devices in it . Every vendor has its own operating system ( " Ciscos got , like , what five ? at this point , " Erickson says ) and network management system . <p> The other problem is the scale of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thousands , of devices not including servers , and any one of those may have half a million rules , " Erickson says . " Youve got this cognitive load that 's being put onto humans . You 're one change away from a major business-affecting outage .

Kazemians research at Stanford involved applying this concept to a network . <p> " He had the worlds first paper on how to precisely model every individual network device in your environment , and on top of that , an algorithm that would trace where every packet could go in your network , " Erickson says . <p> Another startup applying formal verification is Veriflow , which raised $8.2 million in July .

@@21507954 @1507954/ <h> SPONSORED <p> " Its so simple that I 've been asking for months now : Why are we the first ones to do this ? " he says . <p> It turns out Aporeto might not be first with its idea , but it appears to be the first company to put the idea out in open source form a project called Trireme , which the company launched today and the first to try building a business around it . <p> Aporeto takes a white-list approach , which is becoming common in newer security schemes . Traditional security would try to block certain actions or bad actors ; a white list is the opposite strategy , in which the operator specifies which actions are permitted . Anything else gets blocked by default . <p> Trireme , which consists of just 5,000 lines of code , applies that concept by making containers identify themselves to one another . <p> Suppose a service requires Container A to talk to Container B. As Container A gets created , Trireme inserts an encrypted signature in its metadata . When Container B starts receiving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and would validate whether the communication is within policy rules . <p> There 's a bit more to it ( more about that below ) , but conceptually , its that simple . Trireme reduces security to label-matching . <p> Because this is a white list setup , Containers A and B wont talk to anybody else . That theoretically removes either container as an entry point for attackers , because neither container should be willing to communicate with any outsiders . Even if one container is compromised , there 's only one other point in the network that it can talk to . <p> And it does n't  matter if Container A or B moves around in the network ( or , more properly , if they get destroyed and then recreated elsewhere ) . The Trireme scheme only cares about the identities of the containers , not their locations . <p> Aporetos launch today is mostly about Trireme and its integration with Kubernetes and Docker . The startup is n't yet talking about its business plans , which involve more ambitious work around operations-based security , Stiliadis says . <h> Stepping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Stiliadis job at Nuage . The company was early to get into software-defined networking ( SDN ) , but officials were finding that customers werent necessarily interested in network virtualization for its own sake . <p> " The real problem they were trying to solve was an isolation and security problem . They were turning to the network to solve security problems , " Stiliadis says . <p> He left Nuage a year ago , shortly after Nokia announced the acquisition of Nuage parent Alcatel-Lucent . By December , hed started Aporeto with founders Satyam Sinha , vice president of engineering , and Amir Sharif , who 's running the business side . <p> They did n't  have Aporetos technology mapped out at the time . Like many other entrepreneurs , they were playing off of the opportunity to rethink security in the age of cloud-native applications applications that would be segmented into containers rather than presented as one complex mass . <p> Security , until now , has been network based . " They deal with IP addresses , and firewalls try to do things based on this guessing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scale for the new world of all these distributed applications and microservices . " <p> Moreover , container-based applications are easy to shut down and are meant to be easy to move . This means you 've got a lot more endpoints in the network than before , and they 're being created at a faster rate . So , security for the cloud shouldnt depend on infrastructure at all , Stiliadis says . <p> Stiliadis is quick to admit that he comes from that old-school , network-based model of security . " I did that , right ? I 'm contradicting myself because I learned . I 'm getting better as I age , " he says . " The reason I had to leave where I was , was that I could n't hear another conversation about service chaining . " <h> The Less Simple Parts <p> Considering Triremes simplicity , you might wonder if anyone else has come up with the same idea . Stiliadis found an NSA paper from the 1990s describing something similar , using labels in IP packets . But in a more relevant context , Google has dropped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ network , Stiliadis says . <p> What Trireme really does is move the acts of authentication and authorization into the application . In other words , an application no longer contacts the network to verify a partners identity or to get permission to talk to another server . <p> Containers are n't  doing this authentication and authorization all by themselves , though . Trireme instantiates itself as a sort of software gatekeeper in front of each container . So , going back to the example above , what 's really happening is that Container Bs Trireme guard is receiving packets from Container A and , like a nightclub bouncer , is verifying that the incoming packets are " on the list . " <p> The scheme reduces security to label-checking , but how do the labels get onto the containers in the first place ? That 's where the integration with Kubernetes comes in , because the softwares most recent release makes accommodations for network policy . Trireme can insert these labels as Kubernetes places these containers . 65701 @qwx265701 65697 @qwx265697 65699 @qwx265699 65695 @qwx265695 65696 @qwx265696 65707 @qwx265707

@@21507962 @1507962/ <h> What is MANO ? <p> The ETSI NFV ISG defines MANO as management and orchestration . The following is from the ETSI NFV ISG : Architectural Framework : <h> MANO challenge #1 : onboarding VNFs <p> One of the key takeaways from the above definition is the lifecycle management of virtualized network functions ( VNFs ) . As a result , an essential characteristic of orchestrators is the ease with which they can onboard new VNFs . Onboarding consists of : <p> Catalog . The first step is adding the VNF to the orchestrator 's catalog , including the VNF descriptor ( VNFD ) . The VNFD provides information about the requirements of the VNF in terms of virtual CPU cores , memory , storage , and its capabilities regarding networking and elasticity . <p> Initialization . The next step is that the orchestrator must be given information about what is required to instantiate and network the VNF . This could be done through a standard protocol such as CloudInit , or it may require scripting through the virtual console of the VNF . <p> Lifecycle Management . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to monitor its health and apply scaling operations when applicable and recovery operations when required . <p> Making MANO easy requires that the above procedures can be performed by a telco operator through configuration , without the involvement of the supplier of the orchestrator , and without requiring programmatic changes to the orchestrator . <h> MANO challenge #2 : real-world operations <p> NFV is now moving from the RFx and lab stage to field deployments . Doing so means addressing a number of operational questions . Carrier-class orchestrators must have the following characteristics : <p> Scalability . They must be able to support thousands of services , VNFs , and servers . This means being constructed using web-scale techniques of horizontal scalability . <p> Security . The orchestrator must support multi-tenancy to separate operations on different services on behalf of different customers . <p> Upgradability . VNFs will change over time , and an orchestrator must be able to gracefully migrate between versions of a given VNF . <h> MANO challenge #3 : integration with other systems <p> Automation is an essential goal for modern management systems , and this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are required to facilitate automation : <p> APIs . Orchestrators need to talk northbound to OSS/BSS systems , and southbound to controllers . Modern APIs and protocols such as representational state transfer ( REST ) ease the integration of an orchestrator with these external systems . <p> Documented . The APIs should be documented in standard formats such as XML Schema Definition ( XSD ) and YANG to ease the job of integration . <p> Componentized . In addition to the orchestration function proper , the MANO architecture also includes a VNF manager ( VNFM ) function . In general , a generic VNFM can handle the great bulk of VNFs . However , an orchestrator should also include an interface to support an external VNFM when required . <h> Real world experience helps <p> Experience is how we avoid mistakes .

@@21507969 @1507969/ <h> What You Might Not Understand About NFV , But Need to Know <p> Let 's start with what you do know . Enterprise IT embraced virtualization years ago as a vehicle for accelerating application development and deployment , and reducing capital and operational expenses . The advent of network functions virtualization ( NFV ) is now happening among network providers for similar reasons . Providers want to bring new services to market in order to stay competitive , and NFV is helping them do it , while also setting the stage for lower long-term costs . Today , the transition to NFV is beginning at the edges of the network and moving inward , and its happening quickly . The rate of NFV adoption has taken some by surprise , and the industry is experiencing disruption that goes beyond the technology shift itself . <h> The who , what , where , when and why of NFV adoption <p> Much of the angst around NFV stems from unanswered questions about who will ultimately " own " the responsibility for virtualized software appliances that perform the functions formerly carried out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , open-management approach that creates the flexibility providers need in order to respond quickly to customers changing service expectations . However , the open nature of NFV is fundamentally different from the established norms of the long-standing proprietary networking industry . 65698 @qwx265698 <h> SPONSORED <p> Take , for example , a typical upgrade process at a major service provider . In the traditional model , the provider has to have a new version of a hardware device shipped and installed even to test a solution . If multiple vendors are involved , then multiple hardware devices are required . Once a vendor is chosen , providers must spend time physically installing new equipment while simultaneously decommissioning the obsolete hardware . This can take months . The speed with which new features reach end users through application improvements is modest , to say the least . <p> By contrast , a flexible NFV environment let 's the provider download and test software appliances on existing commodity servers , and then do the same tests with a competitive software solution before making a final deployment decision . The underlying infrastructure , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far easier and quicker to make upgrades . The scale and scope of expansion moves from thousands of pieces of equipment deployed via expensive physical man power to tens of thousands of virtual machines ( VMs ) provisioned via a software download . End users get the applications they want more quickly , and the provider retains its competitive edge and financial advantage in the market . <p> However , one anxiety-generating question in shifting models from proprietary equipment to software appliances , is who is responsible for NFV implementation and operational management ? Telecom staff , server administrators , virtualization specialists , networking administrators ? <h> Where will these NFV experts come from ? <p> There is a philosophical divide brewing between switching-oriented staff and IT teams , who already are highly experienced with VM management . Who will drive the planning , deployment , and management of NFV ? Network providers operate complex operations , and many diverse roles will be required to successfully manage the next-generation infrastructure its possible some of these roles have not even been envisioned to date . Like it or not , virtualization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the industrys NFV future , but the transition will inevitably be more evolutionary than revolutionary . <p> After all , there are difficult technical issues to address regarding how the new virtualized networking solutions will work in high-throughput environments , where almost every application is mission-critical and anything short of real-time delivery is unacceptable . Enterprise IT faced a similar evolution in the adoption of server virtualization . Adoption began first in test and development , where missteps would n't interrupt critical operations . Years later , production workloads began moving to virtualized infrastructure ; eventually , it was the norm . The same is holding true for virtualizing network devices . For example , were seeing most current deployments of NFV for capabilities like firewall applications , rather than mission-critical end-user services . Slowly , NFV use will move closer to the core , but providers might never be 100-percent virtualized , just as enterprise IT is n't always 100-percent virtualized . <p> In terms of who will ultimately " own " the future of NFV , the reality is that the industry will see an evolution in roles and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ develop a new personnel model along the way . The pace of NFV market acceptance and implementation will , of course , determine how quickly the lines between enterprise IT and core carrier groups will blur . <h> NFV will break down barriers <p> For the same reasons commodity hardware , virtualized servers , and commercially available management solutions enabled IT to evolve from slow-moving , proprietary data processing shops to a core business asset of most enterprises , NFV has the potential to serve as the backbone of innovation , speed , and agility for service providers . Though still in it its infancy , all NFV practitioners , architects , and executives should look to leverage hard-earned lessons in the transition from proprietary hardware to todays prolific virtualized data center infrastructures .

But it turns out you can stitch together thousands of those free samples to create one big botnet , as two researchers explained Wednesday at the Black Hat conference . <p> Oscar Salazar and Rob Ragan , senior security associates at consulting firm Bishop Fox , said they managed to pool 1,000 free-trial cloud accounts during one weekend . Thats 1,000 free doses of compute and storage that could be used for anything from denial-of-service attacks to Bitcoin mining , as they explained . <h> SPONSORED <p> They tried this as a proof-of-concept exercise , one inspired by the question of whether an online sweepstakes could be rigged . But other people are doing it for serious profit . Toward the end of the presentation , they showed screenshots of various cloud services that had shut down their free trials or shut down completely apparently because of this kind of exploit . One screen even said specifically that the service had been overrun by Bitcoin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If you have to stop your signup process in order to revamp it and add new protections , you 're basically cutting off revenue , " Salazar said . <p> The scheme he and Ragan used was n't even that complicated : The generated lots of fake email addresses to sign up for these free trials . It did n't  even take that long . <p> " We did the majority of this proof-of-concept in one weekend , " Ragan said . " Someone who is a skilled coder could actively do this relatively easily , and that was something we wanted to raise awareness of , because we do think well see more of this type of botnet unless these services take more precautions . " <h> Becoming Human <p> Many services verify signup requests by using email acknowledgments . The service sends you an email , and you have to respond by clicking on a link . That process assumes that you only have one email address and have no way of auto-clicking that link or , at least , that you cant generate email accounts at a rate fast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to block disposable-email services like Mailinator . <p> But this being Black Hat conference , you know how the story ends : The fence is full of holes . <p> First , Ragan and Salazar needed a way to generate random-looking email addresses , as in the word cloud shown above , so the requests would n't trigger any suspicion . Coming up with the local parts of email addresses the part before the " @ " wasnt hard . They just scraped the online dumps of hacked services , a truly realistic source of random-looking identities . " There 's no shortage of online dumps in the news every week , " Ragan said . ( Not coincidentally , Black Hat is where the 1.2 billion-password heist was revealed . ) <p> Getting domain names took a bit of finesse . Ragan and Salazars original plan was to just buy them on the cheap , but instead , they found a free solution at FreeDNS ( freedns.afraid.org ) , which has about 30,000 domains you can freely register subdomains onto . <p> From there , it was a matter of using @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ format and input them into the Google App Engine , where theyd set up an platform to automatically respond to the emails . <p> Once they automated whole process email creation , registration , and replying to the registration email Ragan and Salazar started racking up new cloud accounts , up to their arbitrary goal of 1,000 . " That 's just where we stopped . I could scale up even more , to tens of thousands of bots , " Ragan said . <h> Into the Crypto-Mines <p> Having amassed all this free , untraceable compute power , a hacker could launch any number of projects for good or evil . But hackers whove done this seem to gravitate toward mining Bitcoins and other crypto-currencies . They do n't  have to pay for the requisite server farm , and maybe more importantly , the electricity bills for powering and cooling all that hardware get foisted on the unsuspecting cloud provider . <p> Ragan and Salazar tried it out with Litecoin ( Bitcoins math puzzles have gotten too complex for the cheapo CPUs theyd collected ) and calculated they could generate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whole thing down at that point ; being the good guys , they did n't  want to incur too much cost on their cloud-service victims . Moreover , they found out that Litecoin was sometimes sharing resources between users meaning that their project could have affected the work of some legitimate miner . <p> The point is that $250 per day could be had with just a weekends effort . A hacker more determined and dedicated could make a lot more money , and it does seem to be happening out there . In June , Dell Secureworks researchers found a Dogecoin scam that used similar techniques to exploit a weakness in network-attached storage ( NAS ) . <h> What can be done ? <p> The core lesson here is that email authentication is a flimsy way to block bots from stacking up registrations . This is why the captcha was invented , but let 's face it , everybody hates those . " Everybody feels like their being punished " when captchas appear , Salazar said . <p> The researchers suggestion was to set a threshold to determine if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from one place in one minute , for example , it might be time to activate a test for sentience .

@@21507974 @1507974/ <h> 1 . Does an SDN controller take care of all subdomains of network provisioning ? <p> Answer : No . SDN controller addresses the automation of the access layer . A network service typically spans well beyond the access layer where provisioning needs to extend to data center edge , core , and WAN . An orchestration platform provides a more overarching service view while the SDN controller drives the automation of a subdomain . <p> Answer : No . The SDN controller will not provision anything on the legacy network . An orchestrator will be helpful to create VLANs and/or VXLAN in legacy physical network ( PNFs ) as well as any other configurations required for the service . An orchestrator acts as a bridge between legacy and SDN infrastructure . <h> 3 . Does an SDN controller really avoid all manual configurations ? <p> Answer : In a data center environment , the SDN controller is responsible for deploying the tenant services such as L2/L3 creation , spawning VNFs , service chaining , quality-of-service ( QoS ) , security , and overlay for East-West and North-South @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manually configured to perform the policy enforcement . <p> Typically , SDN controller has a three tier architecture : <p> Service directory ( policy engine ) , where service policy is configured <p> Actual controller <p> Underlay infrastructure , such as hypervisors where service is deployed . <p> Let us consider a simple use-case to create a virtual DC container with a three tier application policy ( Web , App , DB ) with VNFs ( FW and LB ) . The network admin has to manually create service policies in the SDN controller for multiple virtual networks ( one each for Web , App and DB ) , and the VNFs ( LBs , Perimeter FW and Application FW ) . <p> Further , the administrator has to manually configure the traffic redirection policy , security , and QoS policy in the SDN controller service directory ( policy engine ) . When the service is instantiated , the policy engine will communicate the policy to the SDN controller , which will enforce the policy in the data center infrastructure using Open Flow or other protocols . <p> An orchestrator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ multiple workflows and avoid all the manual configurations. <h> 4 . Does an SDN controller take care of service verification and validation ? <p> Service validation " An orchestrator has the accurate view of capacity and mapping between service and resources that are spread across multiple network domains . Based on this information , the orchestrator validates that the service is deployable at any given time and estimates the number of services possible . <h> 5 . Does an SDN controller offer service assurance that involves working with external service assurance platforms ? <p> Answer : No . The service assurance involves modeling key performance indicators ( KPI ) using metrics across various network elements in multiple networking domains . Some of these collectors could be external systems that are specialized to perform a particular role . <p> An orchestrator provides a way to model KPIs that can be described together as part of a state machine to monitor key data points on multiple end points and then take corrective action . Actions themselves can be defined as services that solve a particular SLA/KPI violation. <h> 6 . Does an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as firewalls , load balancers , and WAN Optimizers ? <p> Answer : No , some of the leading SDN controllers have very limited VNF vendor support with limited features . <p> An orchestrator would be effective to provision the VNFs for Day 0 ( during service deployment ) and any Day 1-N configurations for any MAC operations ( such as firewall policy , ACL , and VIP creation in Load Balancer ) . <h> 7 . Does an SDN controller have complete integration with OpenStack where the cloud service is deployed ? <p> Answer : SDN controllers should have complete plug-in support for OpenStack . When policy is provisioned in the SDN controller , it has to be provisioned in OpenStack automatically . But that 's not the case now . Currently , the administrator has to provision few policies in OpenStack manually . For example , creation of networks has to be performed in the SDN service directory as well as in OpenStack .

But the 5G architecture is also introducing a re-architecture of the core , incorporating new technologies and approaches that have emerged in the telco networking industry software-defined networking ( SDN ) , network functions virtualization ( NFV ) , and mobile edge computing ( MEC ) to name a few . In addition , the architecture is required to support sharing infrastructure , providing various levels of " as-a-service " offerings leading to complex architectures . <p> So how should we think about 5G ? Faster speeds and greater density in the access ? A bunch of new technologies that need to be put together ? A network that requires complex architecture integration ? A network that will satisfy an unbelievable range of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these , but we need to step back a bit from the trees to see the forest . Let 's focus on what operators are really trying to do and why . 65698 @qwx265698 <h> SPONSORED <p> Mobile broadband has had a significant impact on human behavior and business opportunity , and has essentially allowed the monetization of the Internet . For operators , the dilemma has been to undertake a succession of infrastructure modernizations to increase the speed and availability of mobile broadband , with the lions share of the resultant subscriber revenue going to an increasingly demanding ecosystem of over the top ( OTT ) providers and vertical industry players , rather than to the operators . <p> The future of network services for the consumer is bound up in economies of scale because only massive economies can hope to sustain service and application prices in a range where the mass market can pay . The future of services for the enterprise is however about new capabilities that require dynamicity , flexibility , and allow enterprises more control over their networks . Carriers will realize the benefits of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experiences for people and organizations that they cant get today , by providing the agile , flexible infrastructure required to sustain these futures . <p> The NFV movement has launched a transformation journey towards cloudification of the telco networks . Mobile broadband and 5G are guiding us on this journey to the cloud but they actually encourage us to go beyond and complete the transformation of operators from being just connectivity providers to becoming digital service providers . <h> Beyond the Cloudified Network to the Digital Service Provider <p> 5G is a trigger for requiring MEC because of the massive amount of data pouring in at the edge , enabled by the new high speed broadband that radio technologies deploy . New services made possible by this data flood can only be realized if timely local decisions can be made for mobile users and local storage buffers are available . This requires shared computing resources at switching centers and base stations . A parallel trend in landline networks , triggered by similar scale requirements , is resulting in plans for placement of compute facilities at the edge of the network @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ addition to the advent of edge computing , there is a surge in the availability of compute and storage facilities further back in the network , where the advent of NFV is bringing data centers to the network . All of this computing , coupled with the associated management and orchestration required to operate it , will result in a distributed , dynamically configurable , compute matrix in the operator infrastructure . <p> 5G creates the need to handle dynamic changes in network connectivity due to mobility at higher speeds and the ability to meet demand spikes that are mobile themselves . This accelerates the drive towards advanced programmability for the underlying networks . Several strata of network connectivity are required in the new software defined networks we can think of overlay connectivity , function chaining , and path topology as a shorthand for understanding these strata . These connectivity strata all require control , in order to dynamically connect the applications , the software functions , and the compute matrix respectively . The control plane needs to be separated from the corresponding data/bearer plane , so that the capacity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the routing can be optimized independently . The control required is typically local but needs to be globally informed and based on service-level policies . Coordination of control across strata is desirable , but the dynamicity at each topology stratum operates at a different time scale . So we require awareness across adjacent strata but not tight coupling . The same is true when we consider control across different parts of the operator network . A distributed and federated control infrastructure is the answer . These strata of network connectivity and the associated federated distributed control , will provide a programmable multi-layer topology in the communication service provider ( CSP ) infrastructure . <p> Finally the need for awareness across control layers plus the need for more granular and timely visibility into the network , fosters the ubiquitous deployment of information gathering and analytics in the network . The analytics required is both reactive and predictive , to be used for service assurance as well as for anticipating user needs . Analytics also provides the means to implement the loose coupling between the control layers mentioned earlier . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ orchestration framework and the judicious use of automation , converts information into decisions and actions . We then have the means for automatically and dynamically responding to changes in infrastructure conditions and user behavior resulting in a pervasive decision fabric in the providers infrastructure . <p> This new infrastructure , composed of a distributed compute matrix , a programmable multi-layer topology , and a pervasive decision fabric , is what a service provider needs to be able to change from being a connectivity provider to a digital service provider . 65700 @qwx265700 65704 @qwx265704 65708 @qwx265708 65706 @qwx265706 <p> Dr. Prodip Sen is currently Director and Chief Technology Officer of Network Functions Virtualization ( NFV ) at HPE , where he is responsible for the technology strategy and industry engagement for the NFV business unit .

@@21508000 @1508000/ <h> How to Be A Continuous Testing Hero <p> As the world continues to spin toward real-time processes , real-time apps , and real-time expectations , its easy to see why the practice of continuous testing is primed to hit mainstream in software development circles . Continuous testing , which came to the forefront with Agile , is the process of ensuring that a new feature is continuously tested at every stage from planning and design throughout the entire software delivery pipeline . <p> Continuous testing ( CT ) is grounded in the practice of continuous delivery ( CD ) , the process of building software so that at any given point in time it can be released into production , as defined by Martin Fowler . In the traditional software development lifecycle , a release might take several weeks or months , or even longer . For many projects and organizations this makes sense and will continue to be the preferred approach for some time . Those organizations that want or need to follow the Agile path of CD , require the ability to deploy working software at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to speak . The big umbrella here , of course , is DevOps , which encompasses CD , continuous integration ( CI ) , and CT . <h> SPONSORED <p> The job of CT is to make sure that at any point in the development lifecycle , the development team has deployable software . Because of this " deploy anywhere , anytime " mentality , traditional testing in longer-running phases wo n't work . <h> Continuous testing in action <p> The foundation of CD is rapid , iterative cycles and incremental development , which leads to incremental testing . In traditional development , testing happens in distinct , isolated phases , such as exploratory , regression , and acceptance testing . With CT , the testing focuses on a small unit of work that can be released to production as soon as its finished : think building blocks . <p> CT incorporates another popular Agile testing method called test-driven development or TDD , which relies on automated testing of features that run in parallel with development . TDD calls for test scenarios to be written before development begins . CT also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it to include manual and exploratory testing . The reality of software development is that automated tests do not always provide full coverage . In CT , those test scenarios may also be used to define manual or exploratory tests . TDD is just one tool in the CT process . <p> By starting with a contract or test case that is well understood to incrementally test a feature requirement , you ensure that as a small iterative unit of work completes , it meets that contract in such a way that it is releasable , deployable software . Exploratory testing tools for new feature development come to play as do coverage tools that send data showing anomalies between releases back to the quality process . Coveralls.io is a great tool that 's easy to configure and has wonderful visualizations for the most popular languages , while Jenkins has a highly customizable dashboard . <h> Tools for continuous testing <p> Some of the tools that teams use for CT are also used for CD and CI , which focuses on automated builds and deployments . These applications include Jenkins , Team @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teams understand status of projects , collaborate and get instant feedback at any point in the software lifecycle , along with automating a lot of the work . <p> Containers and virtualization software have also played a critical role in the adoption of CD and CI on software teams , because this faster , highly iterative process requires ample compute power and storage . With newer infrastructure technologies that also happen to be a lot cheaper , such as the cloud , its much more viable to implement CD in companies . <p> Testers may also use open source tools such as the free-to-use CircleCI and Github Issues ( for tracking ) to integrate a continuous delivery pipeline . <h> Technology Ca n't Solve Everything <p> Technology ca n't solve all problems , however , so developers and testers will need to change some of their workflows to master CT . These concepts are closely linked to the Agile and DevOps practices you are probably already using , so adapting testing in this way should not be a huge shift . <p> Developers should work on feature branches that can isolate the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delivers quick , rapid feedback by running subsets of test cases . Add TDD to this process as you see fit to bring even more efficiencies . <p> Pair developer with testers . This common Agile practice helps with the increased velocity of communications , which is required for CT , and also helps each role to educate and train the other . <p> Adopt the AWS " two pizza teams " concept , which calls for small teams that focus on a single product from development through testing , to deployment . <p> Teams should exercise the " Pull Request " model using automation and gating as much as possible during the process . A typical workflow might look like the following : <p> A developer creates a pull request based upon a feature branch he s been working on . <p> Upon a successful build , the merge is completed into a testing branch . <p> A set of status checks run here , including unit tests with CI , potentially integration checks , and automated deployment to specific environments with tools like Docker Compose and Puppet . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ code is merged into a staging branch and is deployed to have regression/manual checks performed . <p> With tight integrations into your ALM , VCS , and CI systems , its possible to signal to each that this manual/regression testing has passed and failed . <p> Once these checks have passed , CT promotes CD ( the ability to deploy now ) , and a team can move on to practicing CD into their production environment on the schedule they choose . <p> Make metrics your friend , and use visualization . These are commonly called " information radiators . " Ideally , they indicate status of release , alerts for projects , code changes , and more , which leads to shared knowledge across the team to solve problems and keep the wheels churning . <p> DevOps automation , fueled by many different powerful tools , including Chef , Amazon Web Services ( AWS ) Code Deploy , and Docker means that there should be no manual operators deploying software . This automation enables CT as a pipeline of deployment . If code passes automated status checks at stage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different team having to manually intervene and track this process . Testers are notified by software where and when something is ready to test . <p> Break testing tasks down into small , incremental steps at every point in the cycle . Teams run through the development/test/deploy cycles frequently so that testing does not wait until the end stage . <p> CT is the process of ensuring the quality of your software to the point that it is always releasable at a moments notice . If your company is delivering software to consumers , or users that need or expect continual enhancements to a product , CT is the means to get there . Teams practicing CD and CT can be confident that they can deploy to production , potentially several times in a week or even in a day , offering quality and functionality to their customers at a very fast pace . 65700 @qwx265700 65704 @qwx265704 65708 @qwx265708 65706 @qwx265706 <p> Bobby Smith is Director of R&amp;D at QASymphony , specifically over its new product research efforts .

@@21508018 @1508018/ <h> SDN and NFV : Stepping Stones to the Telco Cloud <p> In 2012 , we predicted that Communications Service Providers ( CSPs ) of every size and in every region would embark on a journey to virtualize , and ultimately " cloudify , " their networks . Almost all of them have begun that process in the years since . <p> While that 's a victory for the industry , its also fair to say that most CSPs have n't gone far in their journey . Those that- have are taking the best elements of software-defined networking ( SDN ) and network functions virtualization ( NFV ) to develop the first generation of what we call the " telco cloud . " - - The telco cloud is the internal cloud-based infrastructure that will permeate the entire CSP network , providing a flexible and agile service delivery , operations , and management environment . <h> First Steps Combining SDN and NFV <p> As CSPs virtualize network control and functions , its worth asking if merging or , " cloudifying , " is worth the effort . Most of the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Internet Economy requires operating with speed at scale . And that , in turn , requires a degree of network flexibility that too many CSPs either do n't  have or cant offer at scale . To be clear , the telco cloud is n't an adaptation of existing networks " its a transformation in which network service delivery and operations are made to be cloud-native and operating like any other cloud service . To achieve this , virtualization is not enough . Virtualization is an important first step since it allows infrastructure resource sharing and operational flexibility . However , if the underlying network remains relatively rigid and static , CSPs can not take true advantage of the flexibility that virtualization enables . The key in realizing these benefits is to combine the flexibility introduced by NFV with the network programmability offered by SDN . <p> Let 's take an example of the Gi-LAN in the mobile network that sends flows through various functions , factoring in policies and users . In the past , I 'd manage these requests with physical boxes . Virtualization has helped to accelerate the process to some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for over-provisioning . Worse , once you over-provision you create hardwired connections that are tough to change as circumstances and service demands evolve " and that 's a problem , because changes will always be needed . <p> Yet , it does n't  have to be this way . Working cooperatively , an SDN fabric programmed to follow policy can control and automate functions for the Gi-LAN . Adding new services becomes as simple as programming a new policy . This sort of service agility and flexibility are what you get when you bring SDN together with NFV . SDN with NFV accelerates the " cloudification " journey , with more and more CSPs recognizing how important SDN is to NFV . <h> Open Source " an Enabler <p> At the start of the industry movement on NFV , it was clear to many of us that open development , alongside SDN and NFV , was the third pillar that would accelerate the journey to the telco cloud by providing the necessary innovation and development scale .

That kind of flexibility points the way to the future . <h> The Journey <p> We have not yet achieved the true cloudification of both network control and of network service delivery . This requires exploding the monolithic VNFs of today to extract the common services and move to a service-based ( and eventually a microservice-based ) infrastructure .

The controller normally includes these capabilities : <p> Acting as a repository for configuration of the access nodes <p> Administering the network topology <p> Setting and distributing policies for quality of service ( QoS ) and access <p> Reporting usage and performance <p> A set of access nodes that reside at each enterprise site @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a virtual network function ( VNF ) running on a server .

These are reported to the end user , and may also be used by the hybrid WAN and WAN optimization capabilities listed above . <p> To use SD-WAN for building a network , an enterprise user first configures the desired network and policy using the controller . The enterprise user can then deploy access nodes at each site . When installed and activated , the access nodes contact the central controller for their network and policy configuration . The enterprise user can now dynamically define and implement a VPN using a variety of connection media : broadband cable , xDSL , GPON , LTE wireless , and even existing L3VPNs . Sounds great , right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SD-WAN solutions offer a good solution in many cases , but they also have some drawbacks . <p> SD-WAN is standalone . SD-WAN was designed to provide a simplified networking model , but its self-contained nature means it does not easily integrate with other functions implemented as VNFs . <p> SD-WAN is monolithic . The current offerings tend to be built as an all-in-one solution . They typically include several functional components all delivered as a single appliance or software VNF . Most of these functional components such as routing , firewall , traffic management , DPI , and security are tailored to address the core SD-WAN use cases . However , they typically do not address the full range of enterprise customer requirements for each standalone function . <p> SD-WAN couples service and technology . SD-WAN is optimized to address the specific use case of enterprise VPNs . The technology components would be useful for the delivery of other services , but they are closely coupled to the appliance or VNF , and not extensible to other services . <p> SD-WAN is large . While features may be separately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an appliance approach , this means it is difficult for the supplier to sell features on demand . For a virtualized software implementation , disabling features does not reduce the footprint of the software image or the compute power required . Pay-as-you-go is not easily achieved . <p> SD-WAN is a pure overlay technology . It does not support true peering with an operators MPLS network . This complicates creating an integrated network and limits the visibility into performance information from the underlay network . <p> SD-WAN is user-managed . This can create large hidden operational expenses as the burden of managing the enterprise connectivity solution is now the responsibility of the enterprise itself . <h> Evolution to SD-WAN 2.0 <p> There is a better way . By applying the principles of cloud and virtualization we can improve on todays offerings . At ADVA Optical Networking we refer to this as SD-WAN 2.0 . With SD-WAN 2.0 , we can take the best attributes of SD-WAN and augment them with additional features to address the deficits of current SD-WAN solutions . An example SD-WAN 2.0 network is shown below . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , i.e. , routing , firewall , WAN optimization , hybrid WAN , policy , etc . As with SD-WAN , SD-WAN 2.0 provides the ability to create a private network using standard broadband connections , wireless broadband connections , and private line VPN connections . The differences with SD-WAN are in how it is constructed and how it operates . <p> The first big difference is that SD-WAN 2.0 is implemented as software VNFs hosted on an open platform , possibly working in conjunction with SDN-controlled switches for high-speed forwarding . This architecture allows operators to build sophisticated services from best-of-breed VNF components hosted either at the customer site or in the networks core . Functions might include DPI , security , storage , voice , and others that can be added as needed . An example is shown at Branch 3 and Branch 4 above . <p> The next difference is underlay versus overlay . Unlike SD-WAN , which is a pure overlay , SD-WAN 2.0 can also peer with an operators MPLS network , as shown at the PE router adjacent to Branch 1 in the diagram @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be going backwards to the old high-cost model . Why would you implement peering when it appears to increase costs ? <p> It turns out that much of the cost of a traditional L3VPN is for 24+7 support , which may not be necessary in every business case . SD-WAN 2.0 gives the operator the ability to provide a dynamic private network service with a separate service offering to match the requirements and budget of the end user . SD-WAN 2.0 also offers the ability to support a customer portal , so the end user can customize their network and still have the benefit of a managed offering . <p> Another difference is that SD-WAN 2.0 provides the ability to measure loss and latency that is independent from the networking and WAN optimization components that are monolithically included in standard SD-WAN implementation . These independent measurements can then be used for both dynamic routing and optimization , as well as for SLA assurance . <p> Finally , the components and platform used in SD-WAN 2.0 can also be used for other services , such as hybrid cloud applications . These @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ platform already in use , increasing the speed and reducing the cost of service innovation . <p> The table below summarizes how SD-WAN 2.0 compares to SD-WAN . <p> Characteristic <p> SD-WAN <p> SD-WAN 2.0 <p> Topology <p> Overlay <p> Overlay or peered <p> Ownership and management <p> End-user <p> End user or operator with user portal <p> Construction <p> Monolithic <p> Constructed from micro-services <p> Deployment <p> Tied to service <p> Open platform for service innovation <p> Performance assurance <p> Monolithic <p> Decoupled and available for SLAs <p> Value driver <p> Lowest cost <p> Platform for dynamic and flexible managed services <h> A Good Idea Gets Better <p> SD-WAN provides real value and is a good first step toward creating more dynamic and cost-effective private networks .

Since joining GigaSpaces , he s resigned from his ETSI post while GigaSpaces goes through the process of joining ETSI . <h> SPONSORED <p> In addition to his standards work , he s been involved in open source groups , including Open-O and OPNFV . And he does n't  think that people need to make a choice between working with open source or working with standards groups . <p> " I like to combine the two approaches , " says Brenner , adding that standards groups tend to take the long-term view , while open source groups are focused on more tactical , shorter-term problems . But the work of both groups is complementary to each other . <p> Brenners approach is to look at the bigger picture ; pick a long-term goal to solve a particular problem ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then you iteratively start prototyping certain things , " he says .

Nobody competes on security , " he said . <p> Part of the reward would be time saved : Finding an answer on Google or on Github rather than developing it from scratch , he said .

You 'll also find the term used in semiconductor design , where formal verification " proofreads " the connections among a chips transistors billions of them , in some cases and makes sure the whole thing is actually going to work . <p> Veriflow wants to provide the same kind of proof for the network . <p> " We are mathematically verifying whether network policies are being realized , and we do it by predicting all possible data flows , " Godfrey says . <p> Once the network model is done , Veriflow checks for activity that would create an outage . On the security side , it can highlight vulnerabilities finding out what happens if traffic with a specific , suspicious signature appears , for example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far-fetched to think Veriflow could check every data flow . The number of possible connections is vast , and the variety of traffic flows seems infinite . <p> But those numbers can be culled . For example , Veriflows algorithms arguably its most valuable piece of intellectual property gather different scenarios into equivalence classes . In other words , all packet flows that would have the same fate throughout the network can be treated as just one possibility . <p> Using tricks like that , Veriflow can verify a network at Layers 1-4 in a matter of minutes , Godfrey says . The process is handled by software-based " collectors " residing in virtual machines , and by adding more VMs , it can be scaled up , he says . <p> To explain the process more specifically : Verflow queries all manner of data plane devices not just routers and switches , but the memory tables inside them . It looks into the low-level instructions that tell these devices what to do with packets . So , its view of the network is more complex than just a graph @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the network is described as one enormous system . Its a point of view that 's becoming more common .

AT&amp;T , with its goals of 75 percent virtualization and 105 data centers by years end , is a prime example . But their take on the distributed cloud has some wrinkles that ordinary data centers do n't  face . <p> That was the thesis behind an OpenStack Summit talk on Wednesday by Tobias Ford , AT&amp;Ts assistant vice president of cloud infrastructure , and Marco Rodrigues , a Juniper systems engineer . While telcos are moving functions into software , just like anybody else , theyve got some unique requirements for their virtual network functions ( VNFs ) not all of them driven by the five-nines obsession . <h> SPONSORED <p> The goal is to create a world of cloud-native applications , Ford said . Heres what he meant by that : <p> Scale . " If I 'm getting more load in , the way to scale up is to add more virtual machines or containers , and I can do that infinitely . " Obviously , you cant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gets back to telecoms five-nines ( 99.999 percent uptime ) obsession . Cloud-native applications would run on servers , which are n't  five-nines themselves . ( Ford actually talked about six nines rather than five . ) The way around this is to get resilience by hosting VNFs in multiple places something many of them are n't  built to do , he said . <p> Modularity . Applications have to work " in an API model , where you 're allowing yourself to be just a module in a virtual framework . " That 's a new world , where vendors have to give up some control of the stack as do carriers , because they ca n't control the entire stack any more . <p> Those requirements are common to most applications that are moving to the cloud , even if they do n't  strictly need the five-nines part . But telecom does have a few problems with VNFs that seem unique to the service providers realm , and those made up the bulk of the talk . <p> 1 . Getting performance out of general-purpose chips.Intels x86 processors , in particular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ telcos want to see in virtual form . One ongoing question is whether its sensible to rely on single-root I/O virtualization ( SR-IOV ) , which bypasses the servers x86 and offloads packet processing to a network interface card ( NIC ) . <p> Part of what 's missing is a standardized way to test and benchmark all the variables involved , Ford said . " That 's been a lot harder than you can imagine . " <p> 2 . Getting routers to truly scale out . This is n't just about getting virtual routers to work . " Its a lot about automation and configuration management and maybe not having a command line to log into your router . " <p> Ford and Rodrigues . <p> The cloud might also be a chance to " refactor and simplify " the idea of what a router does , said Ford . " If we take a packet from the virtual machine and send it out of the building , you do n't  want to be opening it up and doing something too many times . Maybe there 's a way to consolidate routing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> 3 . Dealing with brownfield networks . This could be the most obvious of the telcos problems : They cant just unplug the networks that are still serving customers , and those networks do n't  easily " cloudify . " <p> The strategy here is to migrate networks to a virtualized form running on servers rather than specialized networking equipment as smoothly as practical , Rodrigues said . The burden for that rests on the cloud platform . Technologies that a physical network provides , such as a way to ping a function to see how its doing , " are mechanisms that all these VNFs are going to want to be using " and must therefore be supported by the underlying cloud . <p> One thing to note about traditional networking gear is that each box came with its own orchestration tool , Ford said . " How do I take all of those things and transition them to a more common approach ? Its one of the things we 'd like to see the community do more of . " <p> 4 . Telling people what carriers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ group , havent been great at this . OPNFV is meant to amend that , so he gave a quick pitch for the open source project . <p> " I want to sell everyone on the concept of OPNFV . There needs to be someone somewhere who brings it all together , " he said . " Were doing everything we possibly can to document and enumerate what were needing . " <p> Another factor that would help would be to develop APIs and data models that are common across the industry .

That led to the first dose of reality : No vendor could provide everything . <p> " They were good in some areas and had deficiencies in others , or they went for a service-integrator type of model , " he said . In the latter case , the vendor would rely on partners to fill certain gaps partners that were tightly knit into the vendors ecosystem and did n't  necessarily suit XOs needs . <p> But there was a bigger issue . " Its obvious now , but it was n't at the time : The technology was extremely green . " It was too early to expect a production-ready architecture and those vendors that claimed to have it had catered to specific use cases , he said . <p> Bateman drew two conclusions . First , the technology around NFV was changing " almost daily , " as he put it . Second , XO was going to have to be its own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its own lab for its own use cases . <p> Combined , these factors suggested working in an iterative fashion with vendors inside the lab , ironing out NFVs wrinkles along the way . It was going to be a lot like software development . XOs NFV selection process was about to go DevOps . <h> Lab Work <p> XO whittled its vendor list down to seven . Bateman set the ground rules : They each got as much time as they needed to prepare for development that would take place entirely in XOs lab . Then each vendor would get one week in the lab , the vendors staff interacting with XOs , to hammer out software that would specifically work in XOs environment . <p> The idea was to complete as much development as possible in one week , rather than undergoing the usual months-long process of email and document swapping . Any roadblocks were pushed aside , to be worked on later . <p> It was " a very open , very DevOps , agile model , " Bateman said . " I was very surprised how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> This was new for the vendors , too , especially considering they would ultimately have to collaborate with competitors . Questions about intellectual property rights sprang up early in the process . Bateman did n't  detail how that issue was solved , but he noted that all the vendors were willing to cooperate . " That was not a showstopper , and I fully expected it to be . " <p> XO came out of the process with an NFV software stack and then developed an orchestration layer , using the same one-week fire drill of a process . " Within probably the next couple of months , were going to be able to advertise to the world the stack that we settled on . " <p> The story does n't  end there , though . XO has no way of knowing whether this process will work a second time . Vendors might not be so agreeable running through this routine again even though they might have gotten some valuable education out of it , as Bateman believes they did . <p> Moreover , all XO has at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operating this new NFV environment , will the company be able to stick to its newfound non-siloed processes ? <p> " Were starting to talk about what that would look like , but we do n't  really know , " Bateman told me. 65701 @qwx265701 65697 @qwx265697 65699 @qwx265699 65695 @qwx265695 65696 @qwx265696 65707 @qwx265707

" I see the technological change coming , and what I 'm struggling with is : How do we change our business processes to take advantage of it ? " Zabel said . <p> As advanced as DISA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Some requests still have to be generated on paper , for example .

" This also means they need to have a certain degree of visibility and control into what we do , " something that 's not in place yet . <p> The desire for visibility also points to a cultural conflict : People relying on military communications are accustomed to having nailed-down circuits . <p> That 's a telecom phrase meaning every hop in the network is predetermined and guaranteed . Unlike Internet connections , circuits are predictable . But that predictability goes away in a virtualized world , where you might not even know the location of the server you 're using , and where virtualized network connections spring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see a wire , " Zabel said . " They want to see blinking lights , and when they see those blinking lights in sequence , they know that their circuit is up . " <p> Moreover , DoDIN is just plain large , serving as the Internet gateway for the entire Department of Defense . Its continually adopting the fastest pipe speeds 100 Gb/s at the moment but " were finding that as network speeds increase , the computing and processing speeds for network-intelligent activities have n't increased at the same pace . " <p> Thats led to dropped packets and problems with load balancing . " I guess there 's a limited number of folks operating an enterprise where they 're pushing that upper limit . " <p> One option would be for DISA to start developing its own stuff assembling open source hardware and software and running established protocols over it all . That 's not a route for everybody , though . DISA is n't interested in it , Zabel said when an audience member asked , and based on her comment , it seems no one in the organization has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Walk <p> None of this means DISA is standing still . Zabel listed a few of the proofs-of-concept that have been developed for DoDIN , including the use of data center interconnect ( DCI ) to move an entire job to a different physical facility . This could be useful for load balancing or for outfoxing an adversary that 's compromised a particular data center . <p> Possibly the most ambitious PoC has to do with modernizing DoDINs information core . DoDIN does n't  have the luxury of going greenfield , Zabel said . The introduction of an automated network has to be done in slow steps , with the newer , virtualized network coexisting with the current one . <p> As with the circuit issue , the information core project shows that operational realities are an important factor in trying to become a software-defined enterprise .

@@21508083 @1508083/ <h> From PSKs to Blockchain : Ideas for Solving the IoT Security Dilemma <p> Security and data privacy spending for the Internet of Things ( IoT ) will increase this year to $348 million , according to Gartner . Why and how are companies upping their IoT security investments ? here 's a look . <p> As industry interest in IoT grows , there 's no question that security has now become a major part of the IoT conversation . " IoT security has gone from being the No. 2 to the No. 1 barrier to IoT adoption , " says analyst Christian Renaud of 451 Research . <h> SPONSORED <p> One of the biggest issues is that traditional security strategies do n't  necessarily work for IoT devices , due to hardware constraints . For example , as Juniper employee Aditya Chaturvedi explained in a recent blog post , authenticating devices via cryptographic certificates , a technique widely used for applications on the Web , is not feasible for all IoT devices because some lack the storage capacity and power to handle certificates . <p> " Certificates can run thousands of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and require complex cryptographic processing , " Chaturvedi wrote . " IoT devices on a limited power budget , think battery operated sensors , can hardly afford such processing load . " <p> That does n't  mean traditional authentication methods ca n't be adapted to meet the needs of resource-poor IoT hardware , however . Chaturvedi suggested that IoT security solutions might build upon the foundation developed for authentication on cellular networks , which use pre-shared keys ( PSKs ) to authenticate automatically to an operators network , instead of using resource-hungry certificates . But IoT-specific solutions for this task , such as 3GPP specification 33.863 , remain under development . <h> Enter the Blockchain <p> Less orthodox ideas for IoT authentication exist , too . In a report shared with SDxCentral , analysts from 451 Research pointed to the blockchain , the technology behind anonymous payment systems like Bitcoin , as a possible IoT security option . That 's because blockchain systems show that " confidence can be implemented by a virtually open-ended number of participants in a system with little or no reliance on centralized measures , " according @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blockchain can verify transactions between IoT devices by making the transactions public and using the consensus of the network as a whole to determine which transactions are valid . That approach eliminates the need for establishing centralized trust relationships between devices using certificates or other resource-intensive methods . <p> According to an IBM report , projects like Ethereum are already working to leverage the blockchain as a way for devices in the IoT to verify transactions . IBM calls blockchain technology " quite revolutionary " as an IoT security tool . <p> " In our vision of a decentralized IoT , the blockchain is the framework facilitating transaction processing and coordination among interacting devices , " IBM reports . " Each manages its own roles and behavior , resulting in an Internet of Decentralized , Autonomous Things and thus the democratization of the digital world . " <p> Alongside authentication , another major challenge for IoT security derives from the fact that the privacy stakes are often higher , since IoT data can be especially sensitive . For example , a Wind River white paper points out that an Internet-connected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uploads it to a utility companys server , produces data that criminals could seriously abuse . " Information that power usage has dropped could indicate that a home is empty , making it an ideal target for a burglary or worse , " the company warns . <p> Chaturvedi made a similar point using the example of IoT sensors on a dam . " Just consider the criticality of the source and authenticity of water and stress level readings from a river dam , " he wrote . <h> How IoT Can Add Security <p> In the face of data privacy scenarios such as these , the obvious answer may seem to be to minimize the amount of data that organizations place on the IoT in the first place , in order to mitigate risk . Yet companies in certain industries are now taking the opposite approach increasing their reliance on IoT devices in an effort to make data more secure , according to Renaud . <p> Renaud says that IoT adoption can prove especially helpful for businesses in industries like healthcare that seek to monitor data security more effectively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ startup that secured $9 million in funding last year , as an innovation for IoT security in this context . Bastille and similar tools seek to identify anomalies through analysis of IoT network data that could signal security problems , in much the same way that programs such as Snort have done for years on traditional networks . <p> Yet Renaud cautions that this does not mean all types of businesses are equally equipped to handle IoT security challenges . In industries such as retail , where automated sensors and technically skilled employees are less common than in healthcare and utilities , security skills need to grow before visions such as Accentures IoT-powered grocery store become widespread realities . <p> The varying approaches and sophistication of IoT security options within different sectors of the economy drives home another important consideration : IoT is a hugely diverse ecosystem . It has many layers and involves a wide variety of devices and network technologies . As a result , there is no one-size-fits-all solution to IoT security . <p> " Theres no such thing as horizontal IoT security , " Renaud says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remotely operated is very different from securing a traffic light . " <p> But for organizations that currently lack compelling solutions for their IoT security needs , new answers are on the way , as security providers familiar with traditional networking pair their expertise with operations technology companies , which have deep experience in securing physical devices . 65697 @qwx265697 65699 @qwx265699 65695 @qwx265695 65696 @qwx265696 65707 @qwx265707

One of the most popular use cases is to reduce network outages . <p> Two big research outfits , IHS and IDC , have been looking at the SD-WAN market , and they have some statistics that show its growing like crazy . <h> SPONSORED <p> In its first forecast of the SD-WAN market , IDC estimates that worldwide SD-WAN revenues will exceed $6 billion in 2020 with a compound annual growth rate of more than 90 percent over the 2015-to-2020 forecast period . <p> IDCs report says the benefits include cost-effective delivery of business applications , meeting the evolving operational requirements of the modern branch site , and improving IT efficiency through automation .

And by 2018 , 82 percent of respondents expect to be in live production of SD-WAN . <p> IHS analyst Cliff Grossner discussed the findings while moderating a panel at the recent Open Networking Summit ( ONS ) . He said the top driver for SD-WAN is a desire by enterprises to provision new branch sites rapidly . They also want SD-WAN to deliver improved application performance and to layer-in security . In addition , survey respondents say they expect cost savings from the technology . <p> Customers seem most interested in concrete use cases . Recently , Citrix announced its CloudBridge SD-WAN product ; and its first customer , The Watershed , said it uses it to avoid blackouts and brownouts . <p> In Grossners ONS session , entitled " SD-WAN : Early Adopters Share Lessons Learned , " at least one customer that is using the technology had specific , practical reasons for using it . <p> Roger Bravo , VP @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chose Talaris SD-WAN in 2011 because it ensures call quality , which is critical to the companys core business . <p> With 270 call centers in 62 countries , service continuity was a big challenge for Teleperformance .

Corsa is hoping to apply the concept to the WAN and the metro edge . <p> A different approach is needed in those networks because their traffic is more varied than what youd find in the data center , Raab says . The metro network faces a wider variety of protocols and bit rates , and video is a bigger factor there , especially in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SDN in Small Doses <p> Corsa makes a data-plane appliance , the gimmick being that it uses FPGAs to apply any protocols you want .

The smaller format is meant to make it easier to migrate to SDN in small doses . <p> Flexibility in the hardware helps the network adapt to different types of services , according to Corsa . That could be an advantage against the software-based virtualization offered by the likes of Arista and Cisco , where " the physical network is rigid , and it ca n't be changed for what the service wants , " Raab says . <p> Corsa is saying it can provide pools of resources that can be assigned to services in the amounts needed . A service gets associated with , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ units ( for traffic classification ) and memory ( TCAM for lookup tables and DDR for buffering ) . The end-user sees what appears to be a dedicated switch with those resources attached . <p> Conceptually , the idea resembles composable infrastructure , an emerging product category in which applications draw from pools of computing and storage resources at will . But composable infrastructure is meant for the data center , where traffic is traveling rack-to-rack . " Once you hit the metro , you 're dealing with traffic that 's coming from some distance away , " meaning latency becomes a more pressing issue , Raab says . Corsa relies on its FPGA to help maintain a steady line rate . <p> In a sense , its more fitting to compare Corsa to a microcosm of a metro router .

The carrier announced in January that its using UBIqubes MSActivator orchestration framework to turn a managed security offering into a self-service portal . For the last couple of days , UBIqube has had NTT officials at its Mobile World Congress booth periodically to testify on its behalf . <h> Build-Your-Own Models <p> Like Tail-f , UBIqube offers one vehicle for activating and managing equipment from multiple vendors . Lack of a common data model makes this undoable in any one vendors management system . Both startups provide an abstraction layer that this variety of equipment can talk to . <p> But Tail-f is interested in configuring switches* , which means dealing with a smaller set of vendors , Souli says .

Carriers have also been applying MSActivator to virtual customer premises equipment ( vCPE ) , a type of gear that 's become a common network functions virtualization ( NFV ) use case . <p> For NTT , the appeal is that its security service is no longer bound to a particular vendor . Equipment can be swapped out behind the scenes while the end customer continues to use the same self-service interface to call up firewalls and intrusion detection services , says Kiyoshi Suzuki , director of product development for NTT Com Security . <p> All told , UBIqube is being used for configuring " several tens of thousands " of devices , Souli says . <p> here 's another major difference from Tail-f : UBIqube has n't  received venture funding .

In addition , different elements of traditional IT infrastructure are also shifting from physical servers to virtualized and software-defined architectures and cloud-enabled services . <p> DCD Intelligence predicts that the growth of in-house hosted IT facilities is limited to around 1.29 percent CAGR between 2014 and 2020 . For co-location , outsourcing , and shared facilities space , growth is expected at 9 percent CAGR over that time .

Also , within large telco providers there is great interest in implementing these technologies . <p> When looking at- current heterogeneous , in-house data centers , many are not yet on SDN technologies . This is primarily because most data centers are still managed in silos , which means each siloed- team is responsible for a different service as well as the IT infrastructure to support it . <p> This creates challenges and complexity because of the gaps between disparate silos .

While concurrent implementation scenarios exist today ( one part of the data center is working on SDN while the other is operating on old technologies ) , this can lead to a difficult transition phase " because you need a clear and transparent view into your existing physical infrastructure and a direct link to virtualized assets and technology areas . <p> It is necessary to have all detailed data on your physical infrastructure available . Otherwise you will not be able to automate your services , keep your service quality , and manage the capacities you need for the transformation toward a virtualized infrastructure . If the physical infrastructure is well known and well managed , then SDN and NFV technologies will provide huge benefits to data centers and interconnected sites . <p> Both SDN and NFV can increase flexibility and agility for the delivery of services , shorten go-to-market rollouts , help automate many tasks , and provide the right network capacities where needed .

Murphy said that , as standards groups such as the Third Generation Partnership Project ( 3GPP ) begin to write 5G standards , there is an assumption that most of the network applications will be in the cloud .

This years MWC- starts on February 21 . So I ask : What now ? - <p> As you know , we 're all excited about the generational architectural shift to NFV and how it 's going to transform networks by driving interoperability , agility , and new services . But we also know that NFV has advanced in fits and starts , with both setbacks and advances throughout 2015 . I think we 're in for a more muted assessment of NFV as we get back to the reality of this tough technology implementation . <p> I still believe that NFV will be crucial to the transformation of operators , because it enables them to more quickly deliver new services on a more flexible platform . It also involves lots of partnership and collaboration " which may be why NFVs- progress has seemed- rather measured at times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just this . As an example , Ericsson demonstrated an evolved packet core ( EPC ) proof-of concept that included- Red Hat , Cyan , and Connectem . Telef+nica was the carrier sponsor . <p> There were , of course , many more announcements of- trials , proofs of concept , and even the elusive deals in which revenue actually starts flowing . <p> MWC 2016 should provide some guideposts to where we might go in the coming year . Will we see more evidence of NFV being used to launch and monetize new services , whether it be a VPN , IP multimedia subsystem ( IMS ) , or Layer 4-7 security ? Will new partnerships emerge ? Will others dissolve ? <p> Here are some of my top questions about NFV , which I- hope to get answered in Barcelona next week . <h> Cisco and Ericsson on NFV <p> Contrary to reports in some quarters , Cisco is making headway in NFV and has been building out the features of its evolved service platform ( ESP ) . Ive been told of many projects in the works @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a major partnership with Ericsson . It will be interesting to see how Ericsson and Cisco work together on NFV , especially when they have some competing products , notably at the orchestration layer , where Cisco uses Tail-f and Ericsson has Cloud Manager . <p> Cisco and Ericsson say their partnership is- " already sprouting , " - according to my colleague Craig Matsumoto . I 'm sure there are many areas in which they will have joint success . But this is a challenging partnership between two gigantic companies , and they will have to make some tough decisions about overlapping product lines and sales channels . Will we get any clues on how they handle this in Barcelona ? As an analyst , I 'm looking forward to some answers . <h> Are Mobile VNFs Tops ? <p> So far , NFV has drawn interest in pockets of specific virtual network functions ( VNFs ) , especially in mobile applications .

It caught my eye because I am optimistic that SD-WAN and cloud VPN services can drive some of the new cloud-based services that could push the NFV market forward . But Cisco and DT have been mum on what 's happened since . Research indicates that virtual edge and SD-WAN applications such as VPN have drawn a large amount of- attention from both enterprise users and operators .

@@21508128 @1508128/ <h> Napatech Tries an FPGA Approach to NFV Performance <p> Specialty hardware vendor Napatech is working on a network interface card ( NIC ) that it hopes can solidify network functions virtualization ( NFV ) performance . Specifically , the company aims to get one CPU core to handle a full 40-Gb/s payload under any circumstances . <p> The NIC has progressed far enough that Napatech was able to display the hardware at Mobile World Congress last week . Its active ingredient is a line-rate packet-processing pipeline that runs on FPGAs . The idea is to offload processing from the CPU , so that you no longer need multiple cores to get to 40 Gb/s . <h> SPONSORED <p> When it comes to the NICs software , however , Napatech is screening its customers as to which features should be included . The company is moving deliberately , because the NFV NIC represents a new business model : It would be Napatechs first general-purpose product , after more than a decade of producing NICs for specific tasks such as accelerating network management or security . <p> " Were used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you 're talking millions per year , " says Dan Joe Barry , Napatechs vice president of positioning and its chief evangelist . " We want to launch this year . We want to make sure that when we do , we 've reached a consensus on what 's useful . " <p> The plan is to have commercial prototypes ready by April , with general availability sometime this year . <h> NFV in Every Server <p> Based in Denmark , Napatech has been offering acceleration hardware for 13 years . Its customers include appliance vendors that needed to adapt to NFV , and their concerns about the performance of virtualized network functions ( VNFs ) led to the creation of the NFV NIC . <p> Napatech first wanted to build a specialty NIC that would accelerate OVS in particular servers , but the idea sank . Carriers did n't  want a special NFV Zone . They wanted data centers full of uniform , commoditized servers the model of the hyperscale players . <p> " At Mobile World Congress last year , we got a clear message from some of the NFV @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got to be in every server , " says Barry . <p> NFV performance is n't always an issue , but it does tend to arise when dealing with small packet sizes and small packets happen more frequently when voice and video traffic are being processed . In September , Intel released a benchmark report showing that in a worst-case scenario involving 64-byte packets and off-the-shelf NICs , it can take several CPU cores to reach 40-Gb/s . <p> One issue is that most NICs are general-purpose products that are n't  engineered for traffic throughput , Barry says . " You sell millions of those things every year for all sorts of uses , and you do n't  need full capacity in 90 percent of them . " <p> NFV is different its going to be handling functions that do need full line rate . So Napatech built the NFV NIC to be a throughput monster , loaded with high-end FPGAs . Its running a packet-processing pipeline engineered to keep up with line rate . The hope is to offload some of the tasks that eat into CPU cycles . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has open-sourced its Data Plane Developer Kit ( DPDK ) , which companies including 6WIND and Wind River ( an Intel subsidiary ) have taken advantage of . And the crew working on Open vSwitch , an open source project that 's landed under the ownership of VMware , has been working on performance improvements as well . <p> One well accepted approach has been single root I/O virtualization ( SR-IOV ) , which connects VNFs directly to the NIC , bypassing the virtual switch . This can help , because communications between the CPU and virtual switch are one of the reasons NFV performance might suffer . <p> But the price is a loss of mobility , as it would be difficult to migrate a VNF to a different server . " Its not impossible to move these things , but its pretty hard , " says Barry . <p> Because the NFV NIC uses FPGAs , it could be programmable on the fly . That is , the FPGAs could adjust to different types of VNFs that pop into existence . A particular VNF could load look up tables @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ OVS switching throughput even further . <p> Making this work would require more sophisticated management and orchestration . Its something some customers are already talking about doing , but not something Napatech would directly get involved in , according to Barry . 65701 @qwx265701 65697 @qwx265697 65699 @qwx265699 65695 @qwx265695 65696 @qwx265696 65707 @qwx265707

@@21508132 @1508132/ <h> SPONSORED <p> Other efforts are looking at streamlining VMs to better suit containers . Citrix , for instance , gave an OSSV talk about its App Adapter , a software work-in-progress that would run containers directly on the hypervisor . <h> VMs &amp; Containers : Why Both ? <p> A Linux container is a single package for an application and its dependencies , such as libraries . Containers are an old idea , but Docker made them easy to implement and turned them into a hot property . The draw is application portability : A container makes it easy to move an application , intact , to different environments say , from a test network into a production one . <p> But in production environments , some organizations prefer to run containers inside virtual machines . A big reason is security , which came up during one of the OSSV panels . <p> Multiple containers can ride on one host , meaning they 're sharing one Linux kernel . That creates a tempting attack surface , considering how often applications send calls to the kernel . <p> " Magnums @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barrier and do n't  use it as a security barrier , " he said during the OSSV panel . <p> The problem is that VMs are n't  as small or efficient as containers . Groups of containers can squeeze onto one host , which yields better resource utilization than VMs get . That goes not just for CPU cycles but for memory , which is often the largest IT expense aside from people , said Derek Collison , CEO of Apcera ( now majority-owned by Ericsson ) . <p> That efficiency gap leads some to believe the VM-container equation can be improved . <h> OpenStack Without VMs <p> Canonical , for one , sees a path toward eliminating VMs . CEO Shuttleworths OSSV talk was about Canonicals OpenStack work in general and included some live demos of cloud tools such as Landscape ( management ) and MAAS ( bare-metal provisioning ) , but he concluded it with a diagram of a possible all-container OpenStack . <p> That setup would be based on a recent Canonical invention called LXD , pronounced " lexdee . " Its described as a hypervisor for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the kernel . LXD replaces that function , so that applications talk to it , not directly to the host OS . <p> This creates more separation between containers . The containers are n't  all talking to the kernel , so the wide attack surface where a security breach on any container leads to kernel access goes away . <p> Citrix presented an idea along the same lines : App Adapter , software to run containers directly on the hypervisor . <p> The idea is to shrink the needs of containers . Each container runs with an operating system , and that operating system often includes some elements meant to talk to the hardware . <p> " This is where a lot of the operating system overhead comes from , " said Steve Wilson , vice president of Citrixs converged infrastructure group . ( I missed his talk but got a summary from him the next day . ) " If you 're not ever going to have physical hardware underneath , or even simulated physical hardware , you 're not going to need any of that . " <p> App @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to be shared among containers . What 's left on the container is an OS reduced to " basic life support . " <p> Among the advantages would be speed , because containers would n't have to boot up . The boot sequence , in which an OS does things like scout around for available memory , would be inherited from the hypervisor . <h> VMs on a Diet <p> App Adapter seems like it could be another way to remove the VM from the container equation . But its worth noting that Wilsons talk was titled , " It Isnt Containers vs . VMs . It Is About Applications . " <p> And his talk mentioned a couple of other efforts that are built around keeping VMs but streamlining them . That 's the purpose behind Clear Containers , which were first designed for the CoreOS container system known as rkt . Among Intels goals in starting the project was to optimize the use of memory . <p> Another project called Hyper ( the underscore is part of the name ) aims to create a hypervisor-agnostic engine for Docker containers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overhead , and avoid the shared-kernel security issue . <p> here 's the key to all these efforts , something Wilson and Rackspaces Otto both mentioned : Containers werent created to be infrastructure the way that VMs were . Its more accurate to think about containers as a way to package and move an application , Wilson told me . VMs can provide the missing infrastructure piece . <p> " This is really going to accelerate the container value proposition around app packaging , " Wilson said , referring to all the projects mentioned in his talk . " You get the benefit of a decades worth of work that 's gone into these hypervisors . " <p> Does that mean containers eventually win at the expense of VMs ? Maybe it does n't  matter , as Apceras Collison pointed out during the OSSV panel : " I promise you , in five years we wont be talking about containers . Well be talking about the next thing , even more lightweight and with even better security .

@@21508135 @1508135/ <h> Coriant SDN Controller : Lower Layers Say Howdy to Higher Layers <p> According to Coriant , there is a lack of efficient interworking in multivendor transport networks , so the company announced new features to one of its software defined networking ( SDN ) controllers on Thursday to address the problem . <p> Coriants Transcend Transport Controller has been around for about a year now . It spans the optical layer up to Layer 2 switching . ( Coriants other controller reaches up to Layer 3 but does not handle the optical network . ) <h> SPONSORED <p> Coriant is now enabling support for the Restconf interface and YANG data modeling language . These provide an open API framework for synchronization between IP and optical-layer SDN controllers . <p> " This part of the features is key to new service deployment because this interface connects the transport SDN with higher network layers , " says Harald Bock , CTO of technology strategy for Coriant . " Its important because the different layers need to be aware of each other . This is interworking layer 2 to what you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bock says without this upgrade , the higher layer has to find out by itself what connectivity it has , which is not very efficient . It also is n't very resilient because in order to project traffic , it needs to know what connections it has . <p> " The YANG model is really the key enhancement , " he says . <p> Another new feature in the controller assures the best path for network traffic by detecting optical impairments , path restrictions , and specific service-defined constraints such as latency . <p> Finally , the controller now provides enhanced network slicing so users can virtually apportion segments of the network across multiple products and layers to satisfy the requirements of a particular end-user . For example , network slicing can be used to partition services for a retail carrier in a wholesale environment or a large enterprise . <p> The new features of the Transcend Transport Controller are in customer trials . 65702 @qwx265702 65697 @qwx265697 65699 @qwx265699 65695 @qwx265695 65696 @qwx265696 65707 @qwx265707

Some deployments have been ground-up rethinks of network architecture , such as Facebooks Data Center Fabric and Googles Andromeda . Others focus on the use of white-box hardware , such as SDN projects at Goldman Sachs . A third type support more agile processes , like Fidelitys Click2Compute private cloud initiative . Major vendor initiatives such as Cisco ACI have looked to this market and not found much traction yet . In each of these cases , the goals of SDN in the data center have been aligned to lower hardware costs , greater efficiency through automation , and faster network service delivery . <h> Life at the Edge <p> But what about using SDN for optimizing WAN , internetworking and the network edge ? External network connectivity and performance are huge drivers for cost , utilization , resiliency , and overall service delivery . Much of the network cost is connecting data centers , call centers , and branch offices together . 65698 @qwx265698 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the network services budget in an enterprise goes to telecom services vendors . That means that telecom services including WAN , ISP , and telephony is 6 to 7 percent of the IT infrastructure and operations budget , more than three times that of network hardware and software combined . When it comes time to lower costs , WAN and data peering and telephony are the biggest levers . These costs are primarily determined by architectures and policy set at the network edge . Ashton Metzler &amp; Associates finds that WAN budgets were three times more likely to increase than decrease in 2014 . <p> In addition , SaaS , IaaS , sensor data from the IoT , and mobile and home traffic from remote employees will further drive the importance of the network edge as the key determinant of cost and performance for most organizations . Intra- and inter-data center SDN has delivered on some of the above goals , but has yet to be compelling to a broader set of the market . <p> The most ambitious SDN projects to date have often included deployments between data centers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cost and utilization optimization for Web-scale networks . But enterprise deployments in production have been much rarer . So if SDN at the network edge has a reasonable business logic , what is holding back broader implementation ? <h> The Case for SDN at the Edge : SD-WAN <p> Consider some scenarios : <p> How do you detect and respond to an outage in a primary ISP ? <p> What is your response to a major cable cut in your WAN ? <p> How do you determine changes to a route with persistently higher latencies ? <p> How do you dynamically split traffic between providers that charge different rates ? <p> These sorts of situations can benefit from automation and coordinated policies that SDN delivers . SDN at the edge is well placed to improve : <p> Cost economics of bandwidth ( with better control over traffic sent to diverse ISPs ) <p> More flexible overlay networks ( such as a new virtual circuit between branch offices ) <p> Performance of inter-network traffic ( with optimized routing ) <p> Fault-tolerance ( with an ability to reroute traffic when an upstream @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ move in this direction , with some declaring 2015 as the year of the SD-WAN . A crop of vendors has sprouted to make the WAN more programmable : Viptela , CloudGenix , VeloCloud , Silver Peak , Talari and Glue Networks . The vision is to program WAN traffic based on cost , performance , time of day , application , data volumes , etc . But for this vision to come together , you need high-quality , real-time data sources to feed the SD-WAN . <h> Performance Data From Beyond Your Network Edge <p> Many organizations , particularly those considering or deploying SD-WAN , already have their own networks well instrumented for performance data . Technologies such as packet capture , SNMP and NetFlow give insight into device diagnostics and network flows . But these tend to focus on data center and campus networks , rather than performance near or beyond the network edge . <p> So what sort of performance data do you need to make SDN decisions at the network edge ? <p> Routing preferences , as well as reachability and path changes over time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Segment-by-segment performance of upstream networks , including measurements of loss , latency , and bandwidth , gives the SDN controller the performance variables necessary to choose the optimal route for specific traffic flows <p> Application-specific availability , response time , and QoS to understand how SLAs are affected by routing decisions and traffic engineering <p> While much of the SDN action up to now has been within the data center , a huge opportunity exists for SDN at the network edge and across the WAN . From saving money to delivering better SLAs to better handling of faults in external networks , SDN can deliver real advantages to mainstream enterprises . Getting there requires a strategy for collecting and analyzing external network performance data , in addition to existing instrumentation , to drive SDN decisions . 65704 @qwx265704 65708 @qwx265708 65706 @qwx265706 <p> Nick Kephart is excited about how the consumption and delivery of applications is changing the structure and operations of network architectures .

At least , chances in their minds . <p> Not surprisingly , their pain points were a familiar refrain for their type of organization : <p> Deploying new hardware , such as moving from 1 Gig to 10 Gig , and selecting new vendors caused the consistent need for retraining , management and operational framework changes . These disruptions are frequently lead to some customers adopting a one-vendor , end-to-end approach . <p> Higher OpEx than CapEx to the point where 90% of costs are operational .

With the onset of cloud , workload management now requires varying degrees of faster network provisioning , changing the network configuration to accommodate a change in the workload environment . <p> Ironically , I would bet most SDN advocates would say " Hang on , those are benefits SDN should deliver . " And indeed , I am one of those advocates <p> If you have open SDN : <p> You will be abstracting the network operating system from the hardware , and therefore abstract applications from the network . This is common thinking with white box servers , and mirroring this level of abstraction in networking is a key step . Once you have this freedom to leverage a consistent software environment , hardware changes do not drive a ripple of management and operational issues . <p> If your hardware is abstracted , and commoditized , you can now think of new topologies that scale by adding common building blocks both to add horizontal scale the number of racks or servers , and vertical scale , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line rate or near line rate path out of the data center . Building out cloud / compute resources with racks , rows and data centers full of CPUs is indeed the parallel thought that is now widely adopted . <p> You will be able to program the network , without making physical topology changes , again helping to reduce OpEx and unplanned downtime . Programmability based on gold standard policies and scripts is again a common means to automate aspects of server management . Networking can move in this direction through the idea of external programming will help IT teams tackle operation pain both costs and unplanned fat finger downtime . <p> Whether you call these ideas SDN or open networking , it does not matter .

If SDN does make application-network collaboration possible , it might also usher in a new type of user , one that is closer to the app side . And that means that companies ( and quota-carrying sales guys ) might need to think about who they sell to differently .

The business cases for NFV are three-fold : <p> Save money on hardware <p> Save money on operations <p> Drive new revenue faster <p> The first two are quite complicated and still unproven in terms of ROI , but the last one is promising and may become the most important because of the thirst for revenue growth . <p> If you had to choose a technology that could deliver savings on operations and capex or a technology that could deliver revenue faster , its likely that company leadership would favor revenue growth . NFV has to potential to do it all , but proving out its revenue acceleration capabilities will be key to adoption . This was reflected in research @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Edge Report . <p> Revenue acceleration will be crucial in the traditional service provider community , which in recent years has struggled to gain traction with new digital services . They were beaten in the content arena by the over the top ( OTT ) content providers and in the data-center market by the cloud platform providers . With growth in mobile services slowing , the service provider market needs to find a way to introduce new services , or at least improve existing services while lowering operational costs . This is how they expect to " monetize " NFV by demonstrating a clear ROI . Its the only way that the NFV market is going to take off . <p> Because of missed opportunities in OTT and cloud , the best bet for service providers is to go back to their roots in consumer and enterprise connectivity and to deliver services that are layered on top . Software-defined security and software-defined wide-area network ( SD-WAN ) - services seem the most promising . <p> Why WAN and security ? Enterprises have a constant thirst for new connectivity services , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a cloud format at the edge of the network .

These types of services can be offered in the cloud using NFV platforms . <p> Mobile to Cloud : Mobile enterprise connectivity is a huge challenge for enterprise customers . Companies want to manage and secure the way employees connect to corporate applications with mobile devices . In many cases a thin client can be installed on a mobile device , so it can connect securely to the corporate WAN using mobile networks .

Racers can save energy by drafting riding behind someone else . As a result , riders will spend long periods of time voluntarily exchanging the lead . <p> " They realize that it makes more sense to continually collaborate , to help each other , until that final moment when its time to compete .

The province of Quebec has a smart grid running live that uses OpenDaylight to collect sensor data on water and electricity usage . " If we can get data from all of those areas , we can create optimizations not just to save money but to dramatically reduce our energy use , " Jacques said . <p> This " green cloud " is a public/private partnership that 's built on OpenStack with the help of Inocybe , Ericsson , and Quebecs +cole de Technologie SupTrieure ( +TS ) .

While Ericsson is a giant in the service provider market , Vestberg said the companies would also find opportunities in the enterprise sector and the Internet of Things ( IoT ) . <p> The partnership was 13 months in the making , the CEOs said , meaning it predated the April announcement of Nokias deal to buy Alcatel-Lucent .

He said combining Ericssons strength in radio , wireless networks , and mobility with Ciscos IP expertise was a particular strength for the partnership . It also gives Ciscos service capabilities an expanded reach , since Ericsson has 65,000 service professionals to Ciscos 11,000 . <p> Despite Ciscos dominant position in routing , Ericsson will continue to offer its own Router 6000 series . Vestberg defended this by claiming that Ericssons router ambitions have always been limited to the edge router that sits nearest to the radio network . <p> Of course , Cisco has routers that could fill that spot as well , but Vestberg deflected the implication that Ericsson would therefore be a competitor of Ciscos . What 's important , he said , is that Ericsson can now sell Ciscos routers to the rest of the network a breadth " which we never intended to address and we did n't  have the means for .

Different colors and different fonts sure ; yet the messages were the same . It seemed that they all got the images and network diagrams from the same sources too .

VCs were reluctant to fund a company that was depended on selling to the ILECs/RBOCs : too few customers and too long sale cycles . So they found the ideal customer base : competitive local exchange carriers ( CLECs ) . CLECs were not a typical VC investment since they required Hundreds of millions of capital to build out their network to " capture customers . " Hundreds of companies with new piles of money that needed to build networks fast to capture those customers . What a great idea , what a great target customer base . <p> The problem was the CLEC business model was flawed . At the time I read at least a dozen CLEC S1 SEC documents . Akin to the same slides at NGN , these S1s were identical as well . The common @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that are underserved , target medium size business and compete on customer care . Stop laughing it was true . <h> SDN and NFV Today ? <p> How does this apply to the SDN and NFV world today ? First , there are too many companies targeting the same known problem network operators have . Their slides and messaging are identical since they have nearly identical products , they all use the same ETSI diagrams , have overlapping implementations or are solving different problems under the same umbrella . This just confuses the network operators and slows down deployment . <p> Second , companies whose success depends on the deployment of SDN must have tons of cash and patient investors . If the CTO of a major SP said that SDN is the greatest thing in the world and deploys it as fast as possible it would still take 4-6 years to impact the entire operation . This is n't a negative comment about slow moving SPs at all . Its based on the reality of operating a network with tens of millions of fixed end points and hundreds of millions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FCC breathing down your neck , shareholders looking for quarterly results that can not deploy a radical new technology as rapidly as the startups and VCs want them too . <h> What Should SDN and NFV Vendors Do ? <p> Vendors in the SDN and NFV market need to follow some simple rules to increase their chances of being successful . They must sharpen their messaging , acknowledge and embrace the installed base , know exactly where their solutions fit in the end-to-end architecture and know exactly who you are competing with . <p> To separate yourself from the competition your messaging must be impactful , meaningful and terse . To accomplish this you need to create your own " billboard " that clearly differentiates you from your competitors and clearly articulates your value proposition . A good billboard gets your message across in less than a second , generates emotional and intellectual responses and makes the viewer want to learn more . Once accomplished you can now consistently expand your messaging throughout your marketing mix . <p> Vendors must be cognizant and respectful of the installed base . Installed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A " rip &amp; replace " strategy is just not an option . These systems are fully embedded into the SPs culture , organization and network . It does n't  matter that todays solutions are more flexible , more open , easier to use and just better . It is not equivalent to switching out a router or adding an appliance in the next rack . <p> A case in point is the billing mediation system . At the time , the installed base of billing systems were written in software that had n't  been taught in colleges for years . Yet , they rendered billions of call detail records ( CDRs ) and generated ( e.g. , printed ) tens of millions of bills every month . Thus , no one was going to recommend they be replaced . Yet , they were difficult to change and adapt to evolving requirements . The solution was to create the billing mediation system . A new " modern " software solution that on one side was a hand crafted interface to the legacy billing system and on the other side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handle the new requirements . There 's a lesson here ! <p> The lesson here is to acknowledge the installed base and acknowledge that people within the SP have been working with them for years . Telling someone at a large service provider who has spent 10 years of their career implementing IMS that IMS sucks is not a good sales strategy . Therefore , do not ignore and disparage the installed base . Its there so you need to embrace it and enhance it without disturbing it . <p> The move toward SDN and/or NFV is transforming networks into more of an IT domain . Instead of the relatively simple 7-layer OSI model vendors are faced with multiple n-dimensional software stacks with a slew of APIs and " middlewares . " Its challenging to create a two dimensional representation that everyone can agree upon . Hence the widespread use of the ETSI diagrams . If you 're improving part of an existing process or BSS/OSS solution , such as an FCAPs or eTOM , clearly define what you 're focused on and clearly understand the interfaces to the adjacent processes . Solve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and dot all Is . " Do not solve your area 95% and try to solve adjacencies 50% . Meaning , just because it may logically make sense to combine functions , do n't  . <p> A corollary to this is not to try to solve too much too soon . The more you attempt to solve the more jobs you 'll impact which will lengthen the sales cycle . It will also be harder to test , trial and implement your offering . Do n't  fall in to the trap of offering a " single pane of glass " solution . You are not offering a total solution and there is zero chance that a tier one network operator is going to build their network operations center ( NOC ) around your point solution . So if everyone is selling a " single pane of glass " the SP will end up with multiple " single panes of glass " which is where they are now and where they do n't  want to be . The lesson here is to integrate with installed " panes of glass . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operate a carrier scale , network vendors will approach these well known problems differently . As seen with similar messaging it would look like companies are offering the exact same solution to the exact same problem . Upon closer look you 'll find that they are not direct competitors . Vendors need to clearly understand who among the array of startups are actually solving the same problem . Upon taking a closer look you may find that your perceived competitors are not competitors at all or are only addressing part of your solution ( their adjacency ) . <h> Conclusion <p> SDN and NFV are both exciting new technologies that are certainly selling conference attendance and market research reports . They do solve real SP problems and in the long run will enhance their business operations . However , given the hype , noise and confusion around both SDN and NFV , vendors must sharpen their messaging to elevate them from the herd . Let 's learn from history so we do n't  repeat the same mistakes . 65700 @qwx265700 65704 @qwx265704 65708 @qwx265708 65706 @qwx265706 <p> Greg Whelan .

That said , I think that integration with those OSS/BSS systems is the element that does n't  get mentioned here . <p> On the messaging front , I somewhat differ in opinion . Not that what is here is not right but rather I think there are different approaches . During times of technology upheaval , people need a source of truth . Fighting to get your messaging across is counterproductive because no one trusts anyone . If you are honest and educational , even at the expense of not pushing your solution specifically . It will engender you to the customer and allow you to assume a more trusted advisor ( provided you do n't  abuse the position ) . 65697 @qwx265697 65699 @qwx265699 65695 @qwx265695 65696 @qwx265696 65707 @qwx265707

@@21508160 @1508160/ <h> TCAMs and OpenFlow What Every SDN Practitioner Must Know <p> Trying to negotiate SDN-enabled hardware today is not an easy thing to do . This is primarily due to current networking hardware not designed for a decoupled control plane . Yet , the release of the OpenFlow v1.0 Spec coupled with customer demand has driven vendors to provide OpenFlow-networking gear . Using existing off the shelf hardware , manufacturers have taken their network operating systems ( NOS ) and interrupted the normal pipeline processing to fork selected packet flows into the OpenFlow pipeline . In order to achieve this level of flexibility on such refined , purpose-built hardware switches , it requires flexibility and performance in its forwarding tables . The quick fix for the early stages of experimentation and proofing on real world hardware is leveraging Ternary Content Addressable Memory ( TCAM ) . <p> Why have we heard so much about TCAMs lately ? 65698 @qwx265698 <h> SPONSORED <p> Today the supported protocol used to instantiate a flow into vendor switches who support SDN is OpenFlow v1.0 . Some manufacturers have begun supporting v1.1 and greater @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Along that thread , most vendors appear to be skipping v1.1 all together for v1.2 and v1.3 . <p> Generally speaking , we can look at hardware spec sheets with the layers and protocols we have in our industry paradigm today and understand capabilities of hardware and how they are weaved or wedged into our networks . Though we are still left programming essentially firmware on each device it is just the reality of the industry for now . <p> Highlights of the OpenFlow Release Specs <p> Version 1.1 Multi-table pipeline processing , MPLS , QinQ . <p> Version 1.2 IPv6 and additional extensibility . <p> Version 1.3 ( Release Pending ) QOS additions among others . <p> Simply put , the first packet of a flow checks the OpenFlow forwarding tables for a match , if one is not found , it punts to the controller and the controller inserts a flow entry in the switches forwarding table . if match ; then forward via flow table , else ; forward to controller . With OpenFlow v1.0 , early hardware adopters use Ternary Content Addressable Memory ( TCAM ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tables or forwarding information base ( FIB ) for subsequent flow lookups of a flow . That does not give much room for hardware differentiation other than having external TCAM on board for more flow tables in TCAM . <p> Most vendors have TCAM in place for match things such as IP access-lists . That TCAM using software has been modified through either a HAL or some encoder like software algorithm to expand the width of the TCAM for OpenFlow lookups . <p> Figure 1 . 12-Tuples of headers . <p> Content Addressable Memory <p> CAM is a unique memory that can do memory lookups in one clock cycle and in a parallel fashion looking at multiple fields at once in a lookup . This is the most common way to accommodate hardware search ASICs . For programmers , CAM can be described as associative array logic . <p> Binary CAM As the word binary implies , is a binary lookup at returns either a 1 or 0 . As exemplified in Figure 2 , a mac address in an Ethernet frame comes into a switch , the switch looks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ address or does n't  , 1 or 0 . <p> Figure 2 . Binary CAM operation example <p> Ternary CAM TCAM adds a 3rd additional component as the name ternary suggest . TCAM lookups match explicit 1 and 0 but also have a do n't  care bit . You will also hear this referred to with regard to OpenFlow as a wildcard bit often depicted to in diagrams with a * . TCAM can have multiple matches and determine a best match . This is necessary since CIDR lookups need to support a longest prefix match . Example 192.168.1.7/32 would match on 192.168.1.0/24 and 192.168.1.0/25 . The closest match to 192.168.1.7/32 is 192.168.1.0/25 and would be chosen . <p> Figure 3 . Ternary CAM OpenFlow operation example <p> TCAM Limitations <p> TCAM is not the cure all for hardware search lookups . TCAM is power hungry , expensive and takes up quite a bit of silicon space . It would not be unusual for it to be the most expensive component on commodity switches . Many vendors use a blend of BCAM memory , SRAM , NPUs and software algorithms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ EzChip NPUs in ASRs , Trie lookups ) . There are techniques depending on how many explicit matches are made across n-tuples to mask wildcard fields in a TCAM entry . You may hear from vendors that flow table capacity will depend on your desire to match a given number of tuples . If you are looking for exact matches on all tuples in every flow it may affect the total number of supported flows while matching a couple tuples in flows with the ability to mask more fields . That said , there are incredibly clever software algorithms that can even overcome full flow match limitations to some degree . <p> Figure 4 . Example of TCAM compression to preserve TCAM space . <p> Looking Ahead <p> Starting with OpenFlow v1.1 and beyond rather than having one flow table there is a pipeline made up of multiple flow tables . While this does add complexity to the standard it also allows for more flexibility in leveraging different hardware components rather than just raw TCAM to do associative array logic . Brocade has a slick implementation of protected and unprotected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ balance the normal FIB and SDN tables . This is important for my personal use cases in research and education networks , to allow researchers to have research networks consolidated on the same network substrate as traditional production services . <p> Figure 5 . There will be new combinations of hardware and software for SDN lookups coming . <p> Nick McKeown put it quite eloquently in a meeting in February of 2010 in the weekly OpenFlow meeting notes . The topic multiple flow tables was being discussed . " We want to create a dynamic where we have a very good base set of vendor-agnostic instructions . On the other hand , we need to give room for switch/chip vendors to differentiate . " <p> This ability to distinguish hardware platforms may the balancing act to squeeze performance out of the hardware market for the next few generations of network devices as the industry dips its toes into SDN while juggling normal forwarding tables , and even more complicated , interactions between the two pipelines . When choosing hardware for proof of future proof of concepts or reading new spec @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like tuple matching will be relatively important when trying to pre-determine performance and scale . Software will be just as important on the southbound interface as it is on the north , but hopefully over the next few years , we can get back to being blissfully unaware of what is happening below the UI when implementing policy and architectures. 65700 @qwx265700 65704 @qwx265704 65708 @qwx265708 65706 @qwx265706 <h> Comments <p> Greatpost Brent . Youve made the totally abstract completely concrete for folks who are n't  fluent in switch architecture and design . The world needs more of this kind of good , practical advice to enable folks to summon the courage to jump into SDN or at least dip a toe into the pool . <p> However I have to take issue with your last sentence . I do n't  think we 've ever been able to implement policy without understanding everything about the low level plumbing . I guess you mean that previously we did n't  need to understand how the protocols get implemented on the hardware , but I do n't  even want to know what protocols are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us way up the abstraction ladder to where all we need to think about is how the network should behave , not how to hook the plumbing together . You 're probably going to suggest we take this one step at a time , and that 's absolutely the only way well get there . But I do n't  want to lose sight of the summit or we may lose the trail <p> Hi David . You nailed it ! TCAM is thrown around a lot these days and until the past year , I was quite delinquent on some of the hardware nuances until I have been forced to understand . Since the community is debating evolving the construct , it seems to be requiring some re-visiting of the whole stack . <p> I think that abstraction needs to be the end game to start stacking meaningful , Northbound applications on top of one another to integrate network resources as just another resource floating in the pool . It certainly makes the hardcore cringe and I would be lying if I said otherwise at times . There is not much more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ autonomous gear that have zero awareness of one another and making them sing . The problem is doing that to scale efficiently . Urs Hoelzle analysis at the ONF had a great statement when he pointed out that most infrastructure elements , compute , storage etc become cheaper when we grow , but networking seems to keep a linear or even worse in some cases exponential climb in cost . <p> Could not agree with you more in keeping the eye on the end game . I am really getting ancy that we are n't  discussing the Northbound API more , but to your point it is probably being tackled in a sequential layered approach . As a VC where do I put R&amp;D money without an articulate roadmap . <p> We are stuck thinking about the details for a while I reckon , but I imagine it will be more hardware focused than speccing out an x86 server today but much much less than the details to try and figure specs out today ( opening the door for a good bashing ) .

@@21508162 @1508162/ <h> The SDN Gold Rush To The Northbound API <p> The momentum around the Software-Defined Networking ( SDN ) Northbound API keeps growing . When is it going to be standardized ? Who is in charge of standardizing it ? Which implementation is likely to be the most adopted ? <p> Before getting into these questions , let 's first take a closer look at what defines the Northbound API . There are two APIs in the SDN architecture , as shown on Figure 1 below : <p> The Southbound API allows for physical and virtual switches to exchange control information with the SDN controller platform . This API could be proprietary or standard . The only industry standard today is OpenFlow developed by the Open Networking Foundation ( ONF ) . <p> The Northbound API makes the control information of the network available to higher instance abstractions such as applications . They could be traditional network services such as firewalls or load balancers or orchestration across cloud resources ( storage , compute and network ) like OpenStack. 65698 @qwx265698 <h> SPONSORED <p> Figure 1 SDN Architecture Diagram <p> Early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thanks to the growing adoption of OpenFlow by major physical infrastructure vendors ( HP , Brocade , Juniper , Extreme , IBM and soon Cisco ) and the wide availability of virtual switches with interfaces providing network control information . Now that the foundation for SDN-enabled infrastructure is becoming more of a reality , all the attention is turning to the Northbound API . <p> Why so much interest ? SDN disrupts the traditional networking market dynamics and several companies want to seize the opportunity to innovate and capture value . The Northbound API has several attractive characteristics over the Southbound API especially for smaller companies trying to get into the networking market . <p> First the Northbound API is not constrained by hardware innovation cycle time . Looking at Figure 2 , we see that both ends of the Northbound API live in software products . This enables faster development cycles , lower investment costs and easier trial and error approaches compared to the Southbound API . <p> Figure 2 Hardware and Software in an SDN Architecture <p> Contrary to the Northbound API , the Southbound API is tightly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It takes on average two years to build a new switch ( hardware and software ) from scratch , and subsequent hardware refreshes ( reusing the same software ) take 9 months . In addition of long development cycles , these projects require significant upfront investment . Even if newcomers focus on the software end of the Southbound API ( i.e. the control plane ) , they are highly dependent on the innovation pace on the network side of the API . In contrast , developing on top of the Northbound API only requires software investments enabling faster innovation and solution creation . These SDN applications can continuously evolve over time without any deadline or dependence on fixed hardware components . A more agile execution means less risk for companies to get into new markets and a shorter path to revenue generating products . <p> Second most of the SDN value will be created and captured at the application layer on top of the Northbound API . Everything below this API ( i.e. the control and forwarding planes ) still delivers the same traditional networking functionalities . The main @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the entire network instead of distributed across multiple networking devices . The network basically keeps doing the same thing ; what is new is that applications can now access all the network control information via the API . The network can thus be programmed with software applications instead of command line interface ( CLI ) . SDN applications can instantly change network configuration to make it aligned with business objectives such as forwarding packets over the least expensive path , dynamically adapting QoS based on available bandwidth and user subscription , dropping suspicious packets and tracking back their source for containment , etc . Security , traffic engineering , multi-tenancy management , network monitoring and so forth are just a few examples . These applications solve real networking problems and have an ROI easier to justify than the controller or the OpenFlow support on a switch ( the later typically is a free feature ) . Each problem requires a different type of expertise and each application can be tuned for a specific market segment making the realm of possibilities endless in a space used to slower innovation cycles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Northbound API for newcomers since traditional networking vendors have a competitive advantage on the Southbound API . Incumbents already own an installed base of customers and control the pace at which the Southbound API is implemented on their equipment . Most of them are large companies ( such as Cisco , Dell , HP , Juniper , etc. ) with significant resources and strong incentives to maintain high barriers to entry . On the other hand , the Northbound API has less legacy and many more players . The SDN application market is more diversified with smaller and more specialized players leaving room for newcomers to innovate and create new complementary services alongside more traditional vendors . IT departments are craving for more diversity and more openness for their cloud infrastructure . OpenStack , CloudStack and others are great illustrations of this trend in the orchestration market . <p> So with so much value to offer , why is the Northbound API still not standardized ? Well by its very nature , i.e. software , the Northbound API is very different than past networking protocols . Per our point earlier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ components is time consuming and requires significant investments . In the past , organizations like IETF or IEEE took a lot of time upfront defining standards before members agreed that they were stable enough to implement and invest in . One example could be VXLAN , standardized back in mid-2011 and coming out in implementations only now . <p> In software ecosystems , the process is very different . Implementation takes place first and standards emerge later , driven by developer adoption . Different companies offer a variety of APIs and SDKs and the market adoption will then decide which of these APIs/SDKs become the de facto standards . There could be more than one winner . A good illustration would be the mobile application industry where mobile platforms can be compared to networking platforms ( or controllers ) the Northbound API based on . iOS SDK was released in March 2008 and currently has more than 700,000 applications . Android SDK was released in June 2012 and already has more than 600,000 applications . They are the clear de facto standards on which most of the mobile innovation is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Store and Blackberry have failed to impose themselves with less than 30,000 applications for their respective platform . <p> Criteria for a successful standardization for APIs/SDKs are numerous . The most obvious are number of developers familiar with the programming language used , friendliness of the development environment , level of abstraction and quality of the information offered as well as licensing model for monetization and Intellectual Property(IP) protection . <p> As SDN is still an emerging industry it is too early to define all these unknown to properly standardize the Northbound API . Networking was not exposed to too much programing in the past so language and environment are still uncertain ( C has been widely used on switches but most of the current API gravitate around REST and Python ) . None of the SDKs are really friendly at the moment as companies are more focused on defining the abstraction and depth of the network control information provided . Indeed security applications need a different set of parameters than load balancer or orchestration ones . The licensing model is also still evolving but , at the moment , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these reasons , the ONF has concentrated its standardization efforts mainly on OpenFlow and left the Northbound API to individual companies creativity until the market matures and selects the best API implementations as the foundation for standardization effort . This said , while the ONF is not standardizing this API , it still ensures that the underlying architecture will be able to provide the forwarding abstraction and other dependencies the API will rely on . This role is assumed by the newly created Architecture and Framework Working Group . <p> So who will be the winners of this gold rush ? There is a broad variety of strategies being used at the moment . The Northbound API is part of the controller and obviously controller vendors have a strong incentive to have their API and SDK adopted by as many developers as possible . <p> Within the traditional networking vendors , some companies like HP or Cisco provide the whole SDN stack ( existing switches , newly developed controller and existing applications such as network management or orchestration ) with more or less openness on the Southbound API ( HP @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open API for the Northbound ( Cisco names its one PK ) limiting their partnership to the application level . Others like Dell , Extreme or Brocade have decided to focus on their current core competencies ( existing switches and applications ) and partner for the controller platform using either their own Northbound API ( Dell calls it the Dell abstraction layer ) and/or the controller partners one . <p> Newcomers have a different approach altogether . Some like Nicira/VMware or Midokura prefer to control the whole stack ( switch , controller and application ) limiting the scope of their solution by the number of environments supported and the number of applications offered ( in Niciras case network virtualization ) . Others like Big Switch focus on the controller and application layers providing an open Northbound API for application partners to complement their offering . Finally others like Pica8 or Plexxi prefer to control the forwarding plane and deliver switches and controllers with or without an open Northbound API and applications . Most of them are using open source as licensing model either Apache or General Public License ( GPL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only developing SDN applications like vArmour and making a bet on a few vendors Northbound API to define their addressable market . <p> The Northbound API is a new revolutionary concept in the networking industry .

@@21508168 @1508168/ <h> How to Effectively Embed SDN in the Enterprise <p> In my last blog , titled " SDN 2.0 Is Meaningless , " I aimed to counter some of the push in the market to create new acronyms like SDN 2.0 rather than focusing on delivering on the SDN promise . In this article , I would like to focus on some more practical matters of how to embed SDN in the enterprise IT strategy and lay the foundation for a successful implementation . <p> While hyperscale cloud players , service providers driven by the promise of SDN and NFV , and specialized other environments are pushing ahead and benefiting from their ( unique ) SDN investments , most enterprises are left wondering how to reap the benefits of SDN and how to embed it in their enterprise IT strategies . 65698 @qwx265698 <h> SPONSORED <p> For starters , the challenge for most IT infrastructure organizations is that SDN is part of a broader automation push in the data center or even beyond . That push crosses domains and is closely linked to business problems that infrastructure groups are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to overcome is a broader engagement between IT disciplines , and then between the business and IT , without applying the " old " and lengthy , formal processes and instead focusing on innovation and agile development as equals . <p> IT organizations can learn a lot from application developers , who have long been engaged with the business and have applied techniques such as agile development to shorten the development cycles , provide results sooner , and provide better alignment with the business . Application developers have also been successful using ever-improving tools and frameworks for ( automated ) code development and ( automated ) testing to shorten time to market and improve efficiency and quality . <p> As networkers , we have to admit that , generally speaking , we have been slow to adapt and have been stuck in our infrastructure world for too long . Over the past years , driven by a variety of factors , server and storage virtualization has become mainstream and with it , network virtualization a la VMware and others . <p> Physical networks , however , have at large been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nineties that we have continued to expand , sticking workarounds on to our existing constructs . And they have been caught out by virtualization vendors , which have taken it to software with virtual switches and routers , thus creating flexible overlays and abstraction but introducing new complexity by adding yet another layer . <p> These virtual constructs , as brilliant and useful as they are , tend to let us forget the fact that there still is a physical network below this overlay that will ultimately determine the capabilities of the overlay and its reliability as well as carrying the actual traffic and creating the integration with non-virtualized equipment and the wide area . We tend to forget these underlays until things go wrong and we need to troubleshoot or we need to provision a full stack . <p> Automation in general and SDN specifically require programmability . And , as every engineer knows , complexity slows any initiative , and bringing simplicity to something complex is real genius . Looking back at the roots of SDN , it had simplicity in its DNA and for good reason . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ physical protocol stack , box by box and protocol by protocol , to achieve your end-to-end automation goal . Something is bound to go wrong somewhere at some point in time . <p> What is needed is simplicity in the physical enterprise networking stack , and effective virtualization and tenant separation , security , and effective and simple automation inherently supported by the control plane to streamline programmability as well as providing effective integration with ( virtual ) compute , networking , and storage for minimal complexity . Furthermore this foundation needs to provide effective OA&amp;M capabilities , fast restore , and high levels of reliability , something our legacy stacks overlaying one protocol on the other do n't  . At the same time , a single central controller will not provide the flexibility and control needed in todays enterprise networks either . <p> In conclusion , enterprises looking to SDN and wondering how to effectively embed SDN in their IT strategies should first focus on ensuring they have the skills and the organizational capabilities to have a business-led discussion and support more agile developments and deployments . Understanding the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use cases needed for effective automation . Also , enterprises should look at SDN enabling their infrastructure , not by getting the latest overlay management gadget , but by asking themselves and engaging with their vendors to seek simple , effective , and reliable foundation technology solutions that will far simplify and accelerate SDN deployments while lowering operational cost even before the first SDN deployment . 65700 @qwx265700 65704 @qwx265704 65708 @qwx265708 65706 @qwx265706 <p> Andrew J.

The open-source league , which started off as a casual pastime between graduate students and uber-nerds , has become big business played on the worlds biggest stage .

If the defender is " too busy to review , " the back judge may allow him to get away with this contact foul . <h> False Start <p> On this play , the quarterback takes the solution that has already shipped , runs it over to the IETF , creates an " informational RFC , " and uses this to trick the unwitting defense , which becomes victim of the old " high margin play . " Smart defenses will pick up this play by noticing when the IETF informational formation is brought in . For an offense built on misdirection , this play can be very successful . Also known as the old " open-washing " play by savvy defenses . <h> The Chop Block <p> This play can be used by any team and is so diabolical that it bears special mention . For this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ software , with differentiation that commands a commercial premium . They expect to score . The chop block comes when another company announces that its similar software has been open-sourced , thus driving its commercial revenue value rapidly to zero . This is a dirty play , and can end the career of an opposing player . In the NFL , defenders know that this sort of cheap shot to the knees is the only way to stop Rob Gronkowski in the open field . <h> Piling On ( The old " Stack Topper " ) <p> This play is not really sporting , but is allowed under the current rules . Here , one steals the show by climbing over the top of opposing players . If , hypothetically , one team had a control solution that covered the entire network part of the field , the opposing player could jump on the pile , creating a whole new layer of cloud control that subsumes the network control and allows them to gather in all the love from the adoring fans .

Gross violations can also be assessed as embellishment penalties , and in some leagues there 's quite a bit of this sort of " diving . " <h> The Ringer <p> Some teams just do n't  have the level of athleticism that allows the elite players to commit ( the only way to finish a patch play ) . On more than one occasion , a team has been able to " outsource " its commit by sneaking a player who is actually a free agent onto the field wearing the home jersey . There is an entire shadow league , the so-called services league that exists only to supply these " pay to commit " ringers . <p> Great things are coming from the open-source arenas around the network world .

Testing has started on 40 Gb/s , and Paine says its expected to scale to 100 Gb/s . <p> Of course , Saiseis new software is n't the answer to net neutrality , or even to a fair user experience . Todays announcement guarantees the Virtual Box software will give " each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " equal access to the local Wi-Fi network which might be true , but Internet quality is affected by the strength of the signal , not just by divvying up the bandwidth diplomatically .

Rather than wait for years-long standards tracks , the CEF wants to take a software approach of iterative development : Throw something in the pond , and tweak it ( or apply CPR ) if it sinks . <p> Its a very DevOps alternative to the standards process , and the reason for it is obvious : Its the norm for the cloud providers that the CEF purports to serve . <h> SPONSORED <p> Those operators change cycles are quick and fluid . " There is no reason why you could n't do standards in a similar way , " says James Walker , president of the CEF and vice president of managed networked services at service provider Tata Communications . <p> The CEF is n't trying to define the entire cloud ecosystem . Its focusing on the interfaces between networks , the junctures where one provider might have to hand off a service to another provider . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tata , which has a fiber-optic network that literally spans the globe , ca n't be everywhere . To deliver a service , carriers often have to hand off traffic to one another . <p> The CEF has been working on this for about a year . This week , its announcing that a reference architecture for cloud services mapping the different interfaces that need standardizing is just about ready for a formal vote , which should occur in November . Meanwhile , the CEF and the like-minded Metro Ethernet Forum ( MEF ) have created the OpenCloud Project to build a test bed for these standards . <p> Its an ambitious effort , but one that 's missing the three biggest cloud providers . Amazon , Google , and Microsoft are n't  among the 26 CEF members yet . <p> All three were approached last year . " They said , Do you know how many people ask us to join their club every year ? ' " Walker says . The big cloud providers wanted the CEF to show heft and presence . With Cisco having joined two months ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ninety percent of the switching market is now represented in the CEFs member ranks , Walker says . <p> The cloud providers other criterion : The CEF had to match the rapid product cycles of the cloud . Hence , the iterative approach , rather than formal standards . <h> Do n't  Fragment the Cloud <p> The concern of CEF members a group that includes vendors as well as major service providers such as Tata and Verizon is that if none of this work gets done , cloud services will fragment . Its better for the market if all networks know how to handle all cloud services if there 's a common language , in other words , that let 's these services merge onto the same roads . <p> That was the logic behind creating the MEF . Carrier Ethernet services often have to traverse multiple networks to get to their destinations , and service providers had been negotiating agreements for those connections one by one . By standardizing those interfaces and setting definitions for types of Ethernet services , the MEF saved the industry a lot of work and , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ethernet . <p> That 's what the CloudEthernet Forum wants to do with cloud services .

Access network to cloud , enterprise to data center , data center to data center all the combinations you can stand to type . " What were looking to do is standardize and therefore simplify all of these various interfaces , " Walker says . <p> The CEFs work might also make it easier for enterprises to deal with their cloud providers . Enterprises " just want to buy services from us programmatically , " Walker says , in the context of his job at Tata .

" ( Cisco , EMC , and VCE either did n't  comment to CRN or gave them a statement equivalent to a no-comment . ) <p> One reason for the rumors popularity is that people have been predicting VCEs collapse since it started in 2010 , assuming Cisco and EMC/VMware couldnt get along forever .

Most UCS customers prefer to buy the setup with storage included and already configured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and VMware , it would n't be surprising to see Cisco try to line up other storage partners for Vblocks-style bundling . <p> Its tempting to assume VMwares August introduction of EVO might also prompt Cisco to step back from VCE . But EVO is n't a hardware play for VMware ; its a reference architecture for converged computing and storage , and the company plans to license it out . VCE could end up being a licensee , in fact . <p> On EMCs side , the company announced today a plan to launch five federation-wide products , each apparently bundling products from EMC and its subsidiaries . The first of these is the Federation Software-Defined Data Center , combining VMwares hypervisior , network management , and NSX with Pivotals platform-as-a-service ( PaaS ) , all meant to work with EMCs storage and data protection . 65701 @qwx265701 65697 @qwx265697 65699 @qwx265699 65695 @qwx265695 65696 @qwx265696 65707 @qwx265707 
@@21508174 @1508174/ <h> SPONSORED <p> That 's the story told to Mike Genovese , an analyst with MKM Partners . And it could explain why Nokias offer of 15.6 billion ( $16.6 billion ) , announced Wednesday morning , was n't higher . <p> The deal " is about a dollar per share less than what I thought it would go for , " Genovese says . And he s not alone ; Alcatel-Lucent shares tumbled down 87 cents ( 17.7% ) to $4.06 on Wednesday to better match the deal price . ( Reuters reports that the lack of any cash in the all-stock offer disappointed some traders as well . ) <p> What Genovese has heard is that Sprint one of Nokias two big U.S. customers , along with T-Mobile was the catalyst for the deal . The carrier offered to hand future network upgrades to Nokia exclusively , provided the Finnish networking giant could wrangle an acquisition of Alcatel-Lucents wireless business , Genovese says . <p> Alcatel-Lucent CEO Michel Combs has confirmed that Nokia first offered to buy the wireless business as reported by French publication Les Echos reported earlier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Genovese has heard , the French government stepped in possibly this week with an offer : Buy all of AlcaLu , and you 'll get a deal on the price . <p> Alcatel-Lucent officials declined to comment , as did a U.S. Nokia representative . ( A query to Nokia in Finland wasnt returned by press time . ) <p> Sprint is offering no comment beyond a prepared statement : " Both Nokia and ALU Alcatel-Lucent are valuable network infrastructure providers for Sprint and we look forward to learning more about the transaction and working closely with them on any necessary transition once the deal is completed . " <p> Its worth noting that not everybody finds the price so shocking . At 1.2 times AlcaLus revenues for the past four quarters , its not far off the mark from the valuations of Ciena or Ericsson 1.4 times trailing revenues in each case , according to Gartner analyst Frank Marsala . <h> Nokia Joins the Champions League <p> In any event , Nokia is now prepared to swallow all of Alcatel-Lucent , promising limited French layoffs as a concession to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would rival Ericsson and Huawei in sheer size . <p> " Theyre trying to build up a contender for the European Champions League . I guess they want to take on Ericsson in the final , " Genovese says . <p> The deal could kick off other acquisitions , Genovese and other analysts believe . Ericsson , in particular , might suddenly feel exposed in areas such as optical networking and routers . <p> Ericsson does n't  have to match Nokias ante , but given the networking industrys " copycat " tendencies , it would n't be surprising , Genovese says . <p> " My experience with this is that Ericsson is going to buy something , " Genovese says . " I do n't  think Ericsson wants to buy Juniper . I think Ciena makes more sense . " <p> In fact , Ericssons partnership with Ciena might have been the prologue to an Ericsson-Ciena acquisition two or three years from now , Genovese says . If so , the Nokia deal might shrink the timeframe closer to one year , he adds . <p> The Juniper theory is popular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Networks , Junipers router portfolio market share closer to Alcatel-Lucents . <p> Unified communications could be another acquisition target for Ericsson , elevating the company from providing vanilla voice-over-LTE ( VoLTE ) , says Akshay Sharma , an analyst with Gartner . <h> Another Big Merger <p> Alcatel-Lucent is , of course , the product of Alcatel acquiring Lucent in 2006 , a deal that you could say worked out in the end . But it took years of struggling to get there . <p> The Nokia/AlcaLu pairing would be another combination of big companies , but it would n't create the same headaches , Genovese says . <p> " Outside of wireless infrastructure , there is n't any overlap . Everything in routing , optical , and access is incremental to Nokia , " Genovese says . " This is n't as messy . Its not just consolidation , because consolidation is only in the wireless part its building an end-to-end company , " Genovese says . <p> The two vendors do share common customers here and there . Both are being used by Verizon for VoLTE , Sharma points out . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot of business in North America , while Nokia has strongholds in Scandinavia ( duh ) , Latin America , and , through Softbank , Japan . <p> Moreover , Nokia and Alcatel-Lucent both appear to be on the upswing . <p> " The buzz is back at Alcatel-Lucent . You could even argue the buzz is back at Nokia , " Sharma says . " Two or three years ago , it was all about layoffs . Both Rajeev Suri , Nokias CEO and Michel Combs , AlcaLus CEO have done a good job turning the ships around . " <p> " Alcatels got a lot of good stuff going on right now , " Genovese says . That includes an undersea-cabling business that might go public and the router division , which has begun expanding into core networks . <p> " Nuage Networks is awesome . I do think Nuage is kicking Niceras butt , " Genovese says . ( Nicira is owned by VMware . ) <p> " Nuage and Cloudband are some of the crown jewels of the IT division " and would give Nokia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SDN and NFV , Sharma says . <p> Amusingly enough , the acquisition would bring Nokia full circle . Through the Nokia Siemens Networks joint venture , Nokia had owned access-network equipment , which was sold to Adtran , and optical transport equipment , sold to the entity that became Coriant . Both deals closed in 2012 but with AlcaLu , Nokia would get back into both of those businesses . <p> " Before , you had an era of diversification , " Genovese says .

Rather , it is a set of principles by which one architects a network to create a more intelligently connected infrastructure that provides increased agility . Put another way , a more agile network is the result of an SDN architectural approach . <p> Theres been much campaigning about control plane separation and programmability being the critical , key elements for delivering on the SDN vision . Granted , SDN without some form of programmability is impossible . However , its the implementation and integration of said programmability that is what 's really important . An API on its own is as useful as a car with no driverits potential without execution . 65698 @qwx265698 <h> SPONSORED <p> Acknowledging that SDN is a practice and not a result , let 's now consider the many roles and responsibilities of a typical data center network . First , we have connectivity , both physical ( ports , backplanes , throughput ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . These connectivity-focused elements of the data center network are concerned only with ensuring that a packet can reach the next element in a chain . Improving the agility of connectivity alone does n't  create a production-ready environment , and much of the human latency of deployment is still present . <p> Figure 1 . Typical services of a production environment <p> So , the question Im forced to ask is , why limit an SDN project to deliver only part of the solution ? A leading driver of enterprises interest in SDN is reducing time to valuethat is , the time it takes for an asset to be deployed and start generating value to the business . Whether its packaged software like Microsoft SharePoint , for example , or a bespoke solution developed internally , delays in deployment of these assets are frustrating for line-of-business owners and , in many cases , a costly problem . Having an asset that 's known to improve productivity or increase revenue sit in a queue makes little sense to anyone . <p> What does this have to do with partnerships ? Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for each type of servicesecurity , availability , etc . This would require separate controllers from various vendors for each service ( access federation , application firewalls , compliance , etc. ) , which would result in administrative issues and , most dangerously , new administrative silos . Remember , the driver for increasing network agility is reducing time to value , which includes solving the human latency problem . Management silos do not solve this problem ; they simply move the problem elsewhere . Take a look at this piece in Forbes showing us that the problems associated with management silos are not new ; they have been witnessed in business well before becoming a technology problem . <p> We can only reduce human latency through validated vendor partnerships , integration of management tools , and the reduction of ( or , ideally , eradication of ) management silos . Succeeding with your SDN implementation requires one to seek out vendors that have partnerednot just on paper , but in combined visionto decrease administrative time at the keyboard .

@@21508176 @1508176/ <h> Heartbleed is of Consequence to SDN &amp; NFV <p> Heartbleed , the OpenSSL vulnerability discovered last week that allows the exploit of SSL heartbeats , had many IT administrators scrambling to determine the extent to which their infrastructure and apps were at risk . <p> Most stories focused on the potential impact to the Internet , with high estimates claiming more than 65 percent of web servers could be vulnerable . ( If you consider both Apache and nginx use OpenSSL and have a combined active site market share of more than 66 percent , it actually may not be such an outlandish number . ) <h> SPONSORED <p> But more troubling , in my mind , are all the other underlying components of our communications infrastructure that were put at risk and what this means in software-defined networking ( SDN ) and network functions virtualization ( NFV ) environments . It has been widely reported the networking biggies acknowledged their routers and switches were infected . From a SDN and NFV standpoint , the implications could be great and inherently more difficult to identify . <p> For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to secure communications between the switches and routers , many of which are using OpenSSL . In the typical case of using an OpenFlow connected by Open vSwitch , OpenSSL is used . Vendors need to take into account not only which of their solutions use the affected OpenSSL versions ( 1.0.1a through 1.0.2beta ) , but also whether their underlying software environment is at risk . <p> Given the complexity , its not surprising we are still seeing updates on a daily basis since the April 7 exposure of the vulnerability . <p> Cisco has a long list of offerings it is still investigating , including the Cisco OnePK All-in-One VM . Meanwhile , HP issued an advisory ( PDF ) saying " the vast majority of HP networking hardware and software platforms and packages are not vulnerable due to the either using a version of OpenSSL that is not vulnerable or not using OpenSSL .

" <p> It should be noted that NOX uses OpenSSL , as does the Beacon controller Update 11PM PT : Correction Beacon is not impacted , per Dave Erickson in the comments below the post and its subsequent derivatives ( e.g. OpenDayLights controller , Floodlight , etc. ) may run on systems using OpenSSL , which means that these solutions may need to be assessed , potentially patched and then tested . <p> In looking at the implications of Heartbleed , its not merely the security risks the vulnerability poses that should give us pause . Its the ease with which a flaw with far-reaching implications can be introduced to our communications ecosystem . The OpenSSL Project is made up of volunteers , with only one full-time employee , according to the Wall Street Journal . <p> Much of what we have today in the SDN and NFV market gets its roots from open-source software and engineering .

@@21508178 @1508178/ <h> SDN &amp; OpenFlow World Congress : Carriers Plot Their Courses to SDN <p> Tier-1 carrier perspectives provided an early highlight of the SDN &amp; OpenFlow World Congress , held this week in Bad Homburg , Germany . The general message was that the capabilities of software-defined networking ( SDN ) are desired right now , but that the technology has n't  reached a carrier-grade level yet . <p> In the meantime , some carriers are already shaking up their operations to prepare for an SDN future . Possibly the most extreme of these is Deutsche Telekom CTO Axel Clauberg , who gave an opening keynote on Wednesday . <h> SPONSORED <p> Clauberg gave an update on TeraStream a very long-term project , aiming to build the network DT will use at the end of the decade , replacing the old networks ( even the original telephone network , expected to be decommissioned around 2018 ) . <p> This does n't  mean completely cleaning house old OSSs will still linger around the network , for instance . But instead of directly supporting them all , DT expects to use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( presumably , by 2020 ) dying languages . <p> Likewise , the teeming hordes of protocols around the network could be narrowed down to just a handful : IPv6 , DHCP , Ethernet transport ( at 100-Gb/s at first ) , and some kind of tunneling protocol , Clauberg said . <p> The optical network is being reduced to " cheap passive splitters , " with all the intelligence being handled by routers . In Croatia , which is DTs showcase for trying out TeraStreams new ideas , the carrier recently showed interoperability between Alcatel-Lucent and Cisco gear , both vendors working toward this new type of optical network . " It will be cheaper , in the not-too-distant future , to build a 100-Gb/s network than it is today building a 10-Gb/s network , " Clauberg said . <p> This network will be Layer 3 , even in the data center , because the scale of a large carrier calls for routing , he said . " Layer 3 is our paradigm ; that 's the key to our simplicity approach . " <p> OpenFlow is probably going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the protocol to mature , however , DT is using Netconf to configure network equipment . Its also using Yang as the high-level language for defining services . Tail-fs NCS product is helping do all of this and is a bit part of DTs controller , Clauberg said . <p> " There is no carrier-grade SDN today , " Clauberg said . " If you want to run OpenFlow in the wide-area , you have to invest a lot . That 's what Google did . " <h> A Carrier SDN Exploration <p> Colin Bannon , chief architect with BT Global Services , offered what he called an " exploration " not a strategy map , but more a sketch of big-carrier life that hed like vendors to consider . <p> Massive carriers such as BT have some problems that go well beyond what a data-center sees . The speed of light actually matters , for instance , because it messes with the latency requests that come in for around-the-world connections . ( Seriously . Bannon said he sometimes has to gently remind customers about the laws of physics . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ service-level agreements ( SLAs ) . To that end , the feedback loop promised by SDN where network provisioning is informed by current network conditions " is what we want first , " he said . " That 's the game-changer , to allow that feedback loop and allow us to attain not just the SLA but the service experience around the apps . " <p> That 's going to take some time to fully develop . In the meantime , Bannon sees Layer 3 MPLS as a solid stopgap option . <p> " I think MPLS has a lot of life in it , " he said . " We need an option to leverage MPLS that has a service-rich set of functionality whether it be OAM operations , administration , and maintenance , traffic engineering , fast convergence , fast reroute those are all important to us to provide that end-to-end , iron-clad SLA . " <p> ( Like Clauberg , Bannon thinks a carrier is best served by a Layer 3 network . Later , over lunch with SDNCentral and others , he pointed out how this contrasts with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ touting with its NSX product . ) <p> Bannon likes SDN , and he thinks NFV will be huge , but he summed up his talk as a " plea from the trenches to think about this incremental model , " one that takes into account the existing network . Vendors do mention this factor , but it carries more weight coming from a customer , especially one with a network operating at such massive scale .

@@21508179 @1508179/ <p> With the upcoming Mobile World Congress 2013 in Barcelona next week , Juniper today announced two new products in their SDN product suite . First , a Services Activation Director application running within their Junos Space central management framework and second , a virtualized mobile control gateway ( MCG ) playing the role of the SGSN/MME in LTE , 3G and 2G mobile networks running on their JunosV App Engine ( virtual machine orchestrator that supports the KVM hypervisor today ) . <p> The Services Activation Director ( which we will not refer to by its acronym ) provides the ability to provision mobile backhaul networks and works primarily with Junipers MX router and their ACX series routers located at cell-sites . Juniper envisions the Activation Director working in conjunction with existing management systems ( EMS , OSS/BSS ) within service providers as part of an overall orchestration solution through utilization of Junos Space northbound APIs . <h> SPONSORED <p> The MCG solution is primarily Hitachi working with Juniper to port their SGSN/MME ( Serving GPRS Support Node/Mobility Manager Element ) solutions from ATCA hardware over to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ JunosV App Engine ( which Muglia had previously called the worlds dumbest orchestration system ) . The SGSN/MME solution from Hitachi is most likely the former Nortel solution that they acquired a few years back as part of their push to EPC ( Evolved Packet Core ) and LTE solutions . The benefits of running a virtual SGSN/MME on an external x86 system versus on ATCA hardware or on a blade in the router include improved scalability and costs , a reduction deployment time and increase elasticity and flexibility in scaling up and down . The virtual MCG is available this quarter and is the first service to be made commercially available as part of Junipers overall SDN framework . The JunosV App Engine can be controlled either via CLI , or from Junos Space and while it does n't  support high availability or load-balancing today , those are apparently capabilities that Juniper will look at in the future . As well , the APIs and integration framework for JunosV App Engine have not yet been published or made public , and support for other hypervisors have been discussed but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mobile Control Gateway will not be different from existing software pricing and the Activation Director will be priced under their new Software Advantage program as part of Junos Space ( enterprise software-style licensing ) . Overall , this was a reiteration of Junipers recently announced strategy and their attempt at demonstrating progress on the first 2 steps of their multi-step strategy . It also demonstrated Junipers focus on bringing SDN principles to their core strength within the service provider space . <p> SDNCentrals key takeaways from the announcement : <p> Juniper is pushing to remain relevant in the SDN conversation and looking to demonstrate concrete steps based on their recently announced 4-step framework <p> While an interesting first step on the Activation Director and virtualization of the MGC , these can be viewed as relatively low-hanging fruit that help with checking the box on some of the four step SDN framework <p> Nevertheless , virtualization of the MCG does fall under the overall NFV paradigm , and while other vendors are discussing it , Juniper is actually pushing it . Our feeling is that this is a trial balloon to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would make sense running under JunosV App Engine control within hypervisors . <p> Likewise with the Activation Director since it only provisions a limited set of equipment in the overall mobile backhaul framework but does improve automation capabilities for existing customers using the MX and ACX <p> It remains to be seen what Junipers strategy for SDN in the datacenter is , and what they envision for their datacenter switches and the tie-in to QFabric <p> The software and services announced today come on the heels of Junipers introduction of the most comprehensive SDN vision in the industry and follows Junipers roadmap to transition enterprises and service providers from traditional network infrastructures to SDNs . Specifically , with todays announcement , customers can address two of the four steps to SDN : <p> + Step 1 : Centralize network management , analytics and configuration functionality to provide a single master that configures all networking devices : <p> Announced today , Juniper Networks Junos Space Services Activation Director application enables service providers to provision thousands of seamless services , including multiprotocol label switching ( MPLS ) and Carrier Ethernet for mobile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deployment and management , and greater business insight gained from service provider networks . The Services Activation Director , along with other Junos Space applications , is scheduled to be available for purchase in the first half of 2013 , which allows the software to transfer to any network element with which it operates . <p> Also announced today , Juniper Networks Mobile Control Gateway ( virtual MCG ) is now running as a virtualized function on the JunosV App Engine , providing signaling and control ( SGSN/MME ) functions to LTE , 3G and 2G radio access networks . As a virtualized network function , mobile operators can rapidly scale up and down capacity to meet variable demand requirements . Comparing a standalone physical appliances approach to a virtualized approach , mobile operators have the ability to accelerate deployment time by as much as 46 percent and reduce deployment cost by as much as 61 percent , according to ACG Research . Part of Juniper Networks Mobile Packet Core solution , the virtual MCG is co-developed with Hitachi , the first third-party to virtualize a network service on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ JunosV App Engine centralizes the development , provisioning and management of both Juniper Networks and third-party applications on a common platform .

With the right product focus we could see Brocade with a compelling NFV solution that combines MLX with Vyatta software running on servers to deliver virtual L3 L7 services .

@@21508183 @1508183/ <h> From SDN to SDx " How Limitless Is It ? <p> While its concepts are nothing new , software-defined networking ( SDN ) is certainly reborn and is achieving new milestones . Many enterprises and service providers are in various stages of the SDN lifecycle whether researching , planning , designing , implementing or maintaining . <p> This paradigm shift is still in its early years and I do not believe it has finished evolving . Theres been an inception of several derivatives over the past few years , mostly via marketing terms : software-defined storage , software-defined data center , etc . And all deliver different things depending on the vendor . The SDN sky is the limit . Or is it ? <p> In reality , its likely more like the first year of ownership than a casual test drive . Were one of the first end consumers to be this far into deployment . And we 've learned a lot during the last three quarters . FireHost is a real-world user of the SDN model . We 've got a lot to learn , most of which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ date later in the year . <h> 3 Early Tips to NSX Deployment <p> As is typical with vision and innovation , there 's a good amount of marketing hype promoting SDN . To complement , balance or validate that message , we can offer real-world experiences through our lens . For example , consider the following three key points that could define the success of your NSX deployment : architecture , operations and automation . <p> Architecture From the onset , it was clear that architecture would be a critical component . Simply , design with the end in mind . It requires planning , strategy , patience and vision , but can be achieved by setting attainable transition steps to help guide you toward the final goal . <p> Operations Once your new NSX environment is designed , skilled teams will be tasked with managing it . Be aware that there exist many new methods for monitoring , managing and troubleshooting the environment . In fact , some previous tools which you rely on or feel comfortable using may no longer work . <p> Automation This may be the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NSX is tied to automation via APIs . What once took teams weeks to deploy can be properly automated and spun up within an hour . To realize this level of automation , start early . Scope the project appropriately . Get APIs in front of developers early . Then use that planning and diligence to execute . <p> On the whole , the NSX experience has been informative and productive . Like any major shift in architecture , we 've had hiccups ( e.g. , scalability , API integration , kernel functionality ) along the way . During implementation and testing , weve fixed issues and exploited many of the discussed benefits . <p> And many of the SDN promises are as advertised . So far , the transition from the SDN concept to SDx execution is real . <h> From SDN to SDx <p> SDN is just the beginning . From here , SDx will only be limited by our imagination , where new possibilities and innovation will validate the meaning of the term . Compute , storage and network are the hardware pillars of all IT companies , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? <p> As FireHost learns during this company-wide migration , we 've had the opportunity to see what the future may hold . <p> Software-Defined Security From logical to physical security , this will keep us all very busy for many years to come . The solutions available today have only skimmed the surface of addressing the security needs of the multitude . It requires deep vendor integration via APIs . Many security products still have no APIs available . Programmability is key for SDx to become a reality and offer true value to its consumers . <p> Software-Defined Operations All the APIs in the world wont do you a lick of good if you are not devoted to automation , as mentioned . That 's one of the promises of SDx : to have a programmatic interface to push configuration changes into hardware for error-free **28;668;TOOLONG purposes or to respond to a condition in the platform or network resulting in a more favorable quality of service . <p> Software-Defined Management This entity brings it all together into a single pane of glass . This is where so many vendors fall short @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that performs well and is feature-rich , but when that breaks and it will are the necessary tools available to determine the root causes of issues easily and quickly ? <p> The above are obviously broad concepts . The real value lies in the application and implementation of these concepts to real-world use cases . Specific use cases identify pain points that enterprises and service providers feel on a daily basis in their networks . These range from operational to scalability issues . <p> I have no doubt that SDx will continue to evolve at a rapid pace and offer new and exciting solutions . And as FireHost prepares for a 2015 launch , we will see firsthand how ready it is to deliver the promises of scalability , cost-effectiveness , security and performance . 65700 @qwx265700 65704 @qwx265704 65708 @qwx265708 65706 @qwx265706 <p> In his role as Principal Cloud Architect , Jason Rieger is an instrumental leader on Armor 's architecture team , which is responsible for ideating , designing , and testing the company 's industry-leading security products and services .

@@21508187 @1508187/ <p> MPLS made possible a new service : " Provider Provisioned Virtual Private Networks " that shifted the burden of managing a VPN service from enterprises to SPs and thus created a new revenue stream for SPs . <p> MPLS also offered a way to " cap-and-grow " legacy network technology , in particular , Frame Relay , ATM and SONET . This allowed some SPs to upsell an enterprise offering of point-to-point Frame Relay connections to a superior offering of any-to-any IP VPN connectivity with multiple Classes of Service . MPLS also greatly helped with the transition from TDM interfaces to Ethernet for much improved equipment economics . Thus , the driver for the deployment of MPLS was financial as much as technical : the opportunity for new revenue , the potential for cost savings , and the ability to seamlessly cap-and-grow. 65698 @qwx265698 <h> SPONSORED <p> Sixteen years on , MPLS is still an active field of research . The past few years have seen significant innovations such as " Entropy Labels " ( for improved load balancing ) , Ethernet VPNs ( E-VPNs ) , multicast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the problems of scale , availability , and fast recovery from network faults . All Tier 1 , and most Tier 2 , Tier 3 and Tier 4 SPs use MPLS in their backbone , and also use MPLS for VPNs , pseudowires , mobile backhaul and other revenue opportunities . <h> MPLS in the Scale-out , Virtualized Data Center <p> With such success in Wide Area Networks , one might expect that MPLS in the data center would be a shoo-in . First , the virtualization capabilities that MPLS brings with IP VPNs and E-VPNs are much needed in modern data centers . Second , virtualization inside a data center needs to be extended outside the data center , either to another data center , or to a VPN customer in a branch office ; both of these use MPLS . Finally , traffic engineering is often important between data centers , and MPLS helps there too . Yet , so far , MPLS has n't  penetrated the DC to any great extent . The question then is , is there a fundamental reason why not , and can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blog will try to answer these questions . <h> What is MPLS ? <p> MPLS consists of a very simple data plane paradigm : label switching with efficient hierarchy , accompanied by a powerful and extensible control plane . MPLS owes its success to both of these , and to its easy integration with IP in both the control and data planes . Label hierarchy ( or stacking ) allows MPLS to cleanly separate its wide variety of uses . For example , MPLS can simultaneously virtualize networks and create overlays . To do this , MPLS uses a label stack with two labels , one for the virtual network ( VN ) and one for an overlay tunnel , keeping these two functions distinct . <p> Figure 1 shows a simple DC with three servers connected via three MPLS switches . There are three Virtual Networks ( VNs ) : red , with 3 VMs , green , with 2 VMs and purple , with 3 VMs . Two overlay tunnels are shown : from server 1 to server 2 as a solid black line , and from server @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> If the red VM on server 1 sends a packet to the red VM on server 2 ( 1 ? 2 ) , two labels are pushed on the packet : a black ( overlay ) label to put the packet on tunnel 1 to server 2 ( since that 's where the destination VM lives ) , and a red ( VN ) label to indicate that the packet is in the red virtual network . When the packet gets to server 2 , it knows to deliver the packet to the red VM , not any other VM . <p> In Figure 2 , the green VM on server 1 sends a packet to the green VM on server 2 . This packet also gets a black overlay label ( again , to server 2 ) ; additionally , it gets a green label ( belongs to the green virtual network ) . Note that the red 1 ? 2 is very different from the green 1 ? 2 , and these packets must be kept separate . The red and green labels do that . Note further @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ labels , not seen by the infrastructure ( i.e. , the MPLS switches ) , but only by the end systems ( servers 1 , 2 and 3 ) . This is how the physical network is shielded from the virtual , and the two are decoupled . Meanwhile , the purple VM sends a packet to the purple VM on server 3 . This time , the packet gets a grey overlay label ( to server 3 ) , and a purple label ( belongs to the purple VN ) . <p> Simple , huh ? <p> A few more facts about MPLS labels : a label is 20 bits , so it can distinguish a million different things . That means that there can be a million tunnels in the DC network ; that also means that there can be a million virtual networks on a single server . These numbers will hold us for a long , long time and , if we do come close to a million VMs per server , there are simple techniques to get to a trillion VNs = <p> So , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Read on . <h> MPLS is ( Supposedly ) Complex <p> As we just saw , the MPLS data plane is simple yet powerful . However , we did n't  go into how the labels were assigned , that is , how server 1 and server 2 both understood that the " red " label was for the red VN , how tunnel 1 got set up , and how server 1 knew that tunnel 1 went to server 2 , etc . All of these are the purview of control plane protocols . And that 's where the complexity starts . <p> Implementing protocols is generally quite straightforward . The difficulty lies in making the implementation robust , defensive , scalable , highly available and easily extensible . Protocols are by nature distributed , which brings with it another order of complexity . Protocols are multi-vendor , which means dealing with many quite different implementations . Finally , there are a myriad of knobs and whistles that are needed to tweak protocol behavior to suit different network architectures and different design points . <p> The above is implementational complexity , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vendor . However , MPLS is also thought to be hard to configure , manage , debug and troubleshoot because of the flexibility of the underlying protocols and the number of knobs and whistles . Isolating issues can be difficult . Mediating between dueling vendors ( Its her broken code ! No , its his misinterpretation of the standard ! ) adds a non-technical dimension to the problem . <p> Having said all that , control plane protocols are the key to managing large-scale networks . The right control plane should simplify management , provisioning , and troubleshooting . The fact that control planes appear to have the opposite effect is a sad testament to something having gone pear-shaped somewhere along the line . <h> MPLS is ( Supposedly ) Expensive <p> Another gripe about MPLS is that , since MPLS is complex , MPLS must be expensive . However , as we 've seen , the MPLS data plane is quite simple . A typical MPLS " core " operation is to swap a label . At the " edge " , that is , the boundary between IP and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : one has to recognize the virtual network to which a packet belongs , look up IP addresses , deal with Class of Service , queuing and load balancing , apply Access Control Lists and push and/or pop labels . " Edge MPLS " clearly requires more work per packet than " core MPLS " . " Edge MPLS " is primarily about virtualization , and is comparable to " edge VXLAN " , while " core " MPLS is about tunneling . Note that commercial chips have had MPLS features far longer than they have had VXLAN features . <p> So , why is MPLS hardware more expensive than plain Ethernet switches ? In part , because of the flexibility that MPLS demands ; in part , because of the robust control plane that is expected with MPLS hardware ; in part , because of the ( lack of ) economy of scale . More on that later . <h> Enter SDN <p> SDN separates the control and data planes . Perfect ! SDN gives a high-level view of network functions no more twiddling knobs . Yay ! The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ management paradigm . Touchdown ! <p> Yes , that is somewhat simplistic . Let 's break it down : <p> Managing MPLS is hard . So , hide the complexity . <p> The MPLS control plane is expensive . So , separate it from the hardware . <p> " Edge MPLS " is more expensive than " core MPLS " . So , move it to the server . <p> " Core MPLS " is not yet commodity . So , use a different tunneling technology . <h> Networks as Cars <p> To understand this better , let 's take the analogy of a car . <p> Network equipment companies take a lot of ( justifiable ) pride in their control plane implementation . This is what makes a network go . The corollary seems to be to flaunt it . The control plane has to be in your face : in the CLI , in provisioning , in management , in troubleshooting . <p> Car manufacturers take just as much pride in their engine its what makes the car go . However , they do n't  push it in your face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you two ( or three ) pedals , a gearshift and a steering wheel to control it . This is because cars have matured ; gone are the days when you mess with the fuel-air ratios ( remember " chokes " ? ) and pump the brakes to stop safely . ( BTW , anti-lock brakes are a reminder that you do want complex technology , but with a simple UI and , hard as it may seem , this is achievable . ) As a driver , you care about what 's under the hood is it reliable , is it efficient , is it safe ? But you do n't  dwell on it while driving ; you focus on the traffic , road conditions and navigation . You have a set of dials that tell you enough of what the car is doing to help with driving , but no more . You can access a whole lot more information if needed , but that 's typically used only when troubleshooting. <h> 1 . Under the hood <p> For the various reasons mentioned above , you want MPLS under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be possible to have a scalable , robust , highly available technology without making it near impossible to manage OpEx economics demand that , and some company will figure it out . We believe that an SDN system can offer a complex technology with a simple-to-use UI . Moreover , the SDN system can present operational data needed to run the network efficiently in a way that is easy to consume , or even let you build your own dashboard . <h> 2 . Transmission and differential <p> Decoupling the engine from the wheels ( via the transmission ) and left from right ( via the differential ) is crucial to building an efficient and fast car . It is just as crucial to decouple the control plane from the data plane . There are technical reasons for doing so , such as upgradability , availability and such . Equally important are the economic reasons : decoupling the pricing of the control and data planes , and enabling pay-as-you-go and other pricing models which a tightly coupled system inhibits . An SDN system gives you this decoupling. <h> 3 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ valve timing are a marvel of mechanical engineering . However , the advent of electronic timing made the timing more precise over a wider range of speeds , and also simplified manufacturing , and thus reduced cost . Moving " edge MPLS " to the server is analogous : use a quite different technology to perform a task , and one may see dramatic improvements in functionality and/or price . <h> 4 . Whitewall tires or black ? <p> What type of overlay tunnel should you use ? Does it matter that much ? To some , yes . To others , no . MPLS is actually quite amenable to running over IP tunnels , simplifying infrastructure switches . Alternatively , one can use VXLAN or NVGRE tunnels with an MPLS control plane . While there are advantages to each tunnel type , including MPLS tunnels , this is really a relatively minor detail . <p> Note that there is another , simpler solution to ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) providing MPLS features in commodity chips . If chip vendors took the same approach with MPLS that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whole-heartedly embracing virtualization technologies ) , economies of scale would address the cost of MPLS hardware . Till then , though , the above solutions will serve . <h> Conclusion <p> MPLS has several compelling arguments in favor of its use in virtualized data centers . The counter arguments are primarily economics , both CapEx and OpEx . A purpose-built SDN system can address these arguments , by presenting a very different management and monitoring interface to the underlying control plane , by decoupling control and data planes and by moving functionality around . Many find this idea intriguing , and eagerly await the outcome as do I. 65704 @qwx265704 65708 @qwx265708 65706 @qwx265706 <p> Kireeti Kompella , CTO . Prior to Contrail , Kireeti was formerly CTO and Chief Architect , JunOS at Juniper Networks . Dr. Kompella has deep experience in Packet Transport , large-scale MPLS , VPNs , VPLS , and Layer 1-3 networking . He has been very active in the IETF , co-chairing the CCAMP Working Group and authoring several Internet Drafts and RFCs ( including CCAMP , IS-IS , L2VPN , MPLS , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Juniper , Kireeti worked on file systems at NetApp , SGI , and ACSC ( acquired by Veritas ) . Dr. Kompella received his BS EE and MS CS at IIT , Kanpur , and his PhD in Computer Science at USC . <p> I would characterize MPLS and VXLAN as both being virtualization technologies . Picking one over the other is not the point of this blog . <p> MPLS also provides a native tunneling technology . Until this is economically feasible , IP tunnels can be used with both MPLS and VXLAN virtualization . There are cases where MPLS tunnels are better TE , fast reroute , etc. , but one may argue how valuable TE is in a structured DC topology . <p> The last ( and perhaps most important ) thing MPLS has is a control plane . But this is also where some difficulties arise : cost and complexity of management . And that is where I see SDN playing a really valuable role taking us to a higher level of abstraction , decoupling control and data , simplifying management , and improving visibility into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the main point ; thanks for the opportunity to clarify ! <p> If you want to deploy the tunnel technology end-end , this one have to be deployed over the WAN with high transport cost . The tax to pay to transport VxLAN is 30% of unusable bandwidth for your data ( 56 bytes for VxLAN vs 8 bytes for MPLS ) and this to me is is enough to avoid VxLAN as end-end transport technology . <p> Thanks Kireeti for articulating the content very nicely . True , SDN definitely plays a predominant role especially in any distributed protocol by decoupling control plane from the data plane . Just for analogy , In OSPF protocol RFC , most of the content describes about the control plane ( how to manager the stuff and et al. , ) and heart n soul of the protocol ( i.e , Algorithm ) is just described in few pages of it . It may not be a surprise , If SDN eliminates the need for having separate protocol specific distributing intelligence for any future protocols design . <p> The first Juniper innovation was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ central control plane decoupling from switches data plane ) . <p> And i suspect that the second Juniper innovation will be a network virtualization solution based on a proprietary Juniper virtual switch that will use MPLS and MPLS-VPN too . For Juniper hypervisors are MPLS-PE routers . But because it is quite impossible to handle thousans of PE ( = each hypervisors is a PE ) , i suspect them to use a SDN approach for that with a central control plane : i suspect Contrail System to be this SDN controller , and i suspect Juniper to integrate it into their existing QFabric controller so their will use the same controller to handle the physical switches of QFabric and the virtual switches of Contrail System . <p> If they use MPLS and MPLS-VPN inside the datacenter , i bet they will proposed another enhancement : for carriers and service providers it will be easier to interconnect their multi-tenant MPLS-VPN WAN to their multi-tenant MPLS-VPN datacenter ! <p> It will be very intelligent to propose that even if its a totally proprietary Juniper solution , witch is not so good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appreciate this global vision if its what Juniper have in mind . <p> Disclaimer : " The views and opinions expressed on this web site are soley mine and not those of employeer " . <p> This is an excellent post . My question is- without a Route-Reflector , you will need full-mesh of tunnels from a server ( vSwitch ) to every other server . Isnt that inefficient ?

@@21508190 @1508190/ <h> SPONSORED <p> On a more down-to-earth scale , IO Visor could improve the performance of elements such as virtual switches by making it possible to run more of them in the Linux kernel , which has inherently better performance than Linux user space . Its an issue that came up last year at VMwares Open vSwitch Conference , where there was some discussion about whether its better to move some packet processing out of the Linux kernel . ( Intel , for one , was in favor of it . ) <p> PLUMgrid is a key member here , having contributed the code that 's giving IO Visor its start . <h> Opening Up the Stack <p> Compared to OpenStack , which relates to the world at the level of the entire cloud , IO Visor reaches into the depths of Linux , where the kernel acts as a nerve center to connect applications input/output requests to the hardware . <p> " Theres still a lot of code to be written and a lot of innovation to come both within the kernel and on top of the kernel , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Foundation . The vendors involved are " seeking to do this work collectively as opposed to on their own . " <p> As you can see by the IO Visor presentation slide below , other open networking projects work even further down the stack particularly the Open Compute Project , which gets into the hardware itself . But IO Visor is arguably the most esoteric of the bunch . <p> Source : IO Visor <p> At its heart , IO Visor is addressing the fact that the Linux kernel is n't virtualized . Because it talks directly to hardware elements such as memory or the CPU , the kernel can provide faster performance than Linuxs user space . <p> But the fact that its not virtualized means the kernel handles one request at a time . To accommodate a new request a new IO module you have to recompile the kernel . <p> IO Visor wants to let virtual machines be added to kernel space with more sponteneity . It has to do with tweaking a part of the kernel called the Berkeley Packet Filter ( BPF ) , which , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that allows certain types of data through . <p> At a more grand scale , IO Visor could let someone build a complete virtual network spread across multiple compute nodes . The kernel would do all the data-plane processing . <p> The mechanism for doing these things is called an IO Visor engine . The IO Visor project aims to create these engines , attendant plug-ins , and a variety of developer tools . <p> If IO Visor succeeds , it will be interesting to see how many tasks eventually move into kernel space . Applications do get better performance there , but nearly all virtual machines are built to run in user space today . <p> " I 'm sure developers will go through the journey of discovery to see what is possible in user space and what is possible in kernel space , " says Wendy Cartee , PLUMgrid vice president of product management and marketing . " I 'm sure both spaces will be used .

" All traffic has to go through that centralized node . Its not fully distributed . " <p> The phrase you 'll often see for this is tromboning , representing a long path with a 180-degree turn the trail a packet must take when shunted from the virtual switch up to that centralized node and back . " The company was really founded to solve this problem , " Cartee says . <p> In fact , some Linux developers were enticed to join the company specifically because of these ideas and its vision of a programmable data plane , she says . 65701 @qwx265701 65697 @qwx265697 65699 @qwx265699 65695 @qwx265695 65696 @qwx265696 65707 @qwx265707

@@21508195 @1508195/ <h> Open Source : The Biggest Risk to SDN <p> During our day jobs advising large enterprises , services providers , network vendors , and software developers on strategies and execution options for their SDN ambitions , we are routinely asked questions about pursing an open-source business model or participating within an open-source SDN ecosystem. - The right answer is dependent on a combination of factors including the organizations short and long-term goals , position in the market , and strategic importance vs marketing importance of SDN to sustain their long-term business and is different for every organization . <p> We emphasize is that before making an investment decision to pursue ( or not pursue ) an open-source strategy its important to understand the alternative paths and respective pros and cons from a- customer- and partner- value creation perspective.Customer Value Creation : <p> Customer value creation is defined as the place in the ecosystem where value is created for the end customer ( say an , enterprise or service provider ) ; such as delivering a new capability or connecting an open source technology to an existing process or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a large-scale , a project typically needs to posses some combination of attributes including : a ) stability and transparency in the stewardship of open source project ; b ) code to work as advertised ; c ) integration into existing IT environment ; d ) solution support ( i.e. one throat to choke for the entire solution ) , and e ) broad developer community available on the open market ( to avoid lock in and hire to adapt to specific needs ) . <p> Partner Value Creation : <p> Partner value creation is defined as the place in ecosystem where value is created for supporting organizations ( like a software developer , systems integrator , VAR , etc ) of a specific ecosystem ; such as delivering a service or software add-on to the open source project . For partner value to be created , - a project typically posses attributes including : - a ) stability and transparency in the stewardship of open source project ; stable ecosystem ; b ) enough customer momentum so that it attract new users / customers to a partner solution ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large pool of developers available for hire ) ; d ) for developers , the open source software should reduce their internal software development load ; and e ) assurances that- the open source project will not compete with partners who are expected to use the open source software . <p> Types of Open-Source Ecosystems <p> To determine how to create customer value or where to locate opportunity to create partner value in an open source driven ecosystem , first you have to understand the structure of the open source ecosystem. - There is a range of open source ecosystems , which generally can be simplified into three types : <p> Loosely Aligned and Foundation Managed Projects <p> Generally speaking , the most impactful open source projects tend to be Foundation Managed and many of the Foundation Managed open source ecosystems started off as a Loosely Aligned projects . - Loosely Aligned projects often morph into a Foundation Managed model due a strong independent community that grew from the ground up with a- clear- customer value proposition and- transparent- partner rules of engagement ( which defines the boundaries where a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Typically Foundation Managed open source projects can support a number of venture-backed companies that each play a unique role in the ecosystem . <p> Vendor- Dominated- Projects <p> Vendor Dominated open source projects are projects that are dominated by a single ( usually commercial ) organization who directly ( via employees ) or indirectly ( via paid contractors , students whose professor(s) encouraged them to contribute to his/her project , semi-autonomous organizations that are dependent in large party by a vendor for funding , etc ) provide more- than 50% of contributions to an open source project . - Additionally , the vendor who leads an open source project need to find a source of revenue which could be a ) support services ( like Red Hat for Linux ) ; b ) up-selling to a commercial version of the open source software ( Big Switch with the Floodlight Controller ) ; or c ) building apps on top of the open source software ( Big Switch with Firewall or CircuitPusher for Floodlight ) . <p> Few Vendor Dominated open source ecosystems transition to Foundation Managed because the bulk of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the vendor which limits diversity of the development community and opportunity to grow expertise outside of the organization sponsoring the open source project . <p> What does this mean to the SDN Community ? <p> SDN Open Source : - Primarily- Vendor Dominated <p> If we look at the most popular SDN open source projects toady we see that they are primarily vendor dominated , including : <p> For example even though OpenFlow is driven by the Open Networking Foundation ( ONF ) there is n't any software produced or managed from the ONF today making the ONF dependent on Vendor Dominated open source . <p> SDN Open Source : - Potentially Risky Business Proposition&lt; <p> For aspiring SDN start-ups , established networking or virtualization vendors , software developers or even end customers ; these Vendor Dominated open source projects are risky projects to place strategic focus and investments in , due to : <p> Rules of engagements are set by one organization- which can be changed at anytime- with a lack of transparency around how decisions are made about the project or sometime even how or why contributions are accepted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an ecosystem by a less friendly company- puts entire ecosystem at commercial risk- ( ala MySQL via Sun to Oracle ; Java ( again Sun ) to Oracle ; or in the SDN space Open vSwitch from Nicira to VMware ) . - There are plenty of plays the acquiring company can run : - such as changing licensing terms for future versions to slow rolling acceptance of 3rd party contributions or standards . <p> Business model always favors the dominating vendor by definition a vendor dominated project is organized to make the most within the ecosystem for the vendor that dominates it . - They also have the power to change their rules that adversely impact other members of the ecosystem. - This is one reason why it difficult for companies supporting a Vendor Dominated project to raise venture financing meaning what venture investor is going to invest in company that is dependent on another company that may compete with them in an early market ? - One common trick the dominating vendor may play is encourage people to write apps for their project only to write their own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> This risk applies to both customers ( potential lock-in that worst than many commercial licenses ) and partners ( potential future lock-out and uncertainty of financial return ) . - The customer risk is mitigated if the application is a tactical application with many alternatives . - One example , is SNORT which is dominated by SourceFire where IDS is tactical and there are many alternatives ; though has a relatively small partner ecosystem . <p> Partner risk with Vendor Dominated open source is more challenging especially given the lack of transparency in decision-making - process ; lack of external developer community to which to leverage to expand your internal capabilities , and risk the dominating vendor is acquired by a company that is n't friendly to your organization . - Remember MySQL . <p> To demonstrate the above-mentioned points , let 's just pick Floodlight and Indigo as an example ( you could apply this logic to any other Vendor Dominated project ) . Say both become broadly adopted - if I was in Cisco corporate development and realized that a ) Floodlight and Indigo are open source projects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up the most knowledge developers of those projects ; c ) and was convincing Cisco competitors to rely on Floodlight and Indigo for their SDN Strategies ; while d ) being the closest code to an OpenFlow reference implementation that the ONF is largely dependent on today I could easily make a business case to John Chambers to spend $1B to acquire Big Switch ; make it part of onePK.This would likely kill OpenFlow and any other emerging SDN standard as Cisco by marrying the Cisco install base and channel with a path to installed base programmability via control of Floodlight Cisco would over night have a credible SDN story with upgrade path for a large portion of the market . <p> This is why being a customer or partner with Vendor Dominated open source could be hazardous . The same , nice , cool company that you enable and help grow , once acquired by your large supplier or rival , will turn the net positive to either further vendor lock-in , or a dangerous weapon against you . <p> Conclusions : <p> The problem we face in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SDN get started ; maybe the same open source with potential to kill the market opportunity as the more a Vendor Dominated open source project is adopted the more risk it brings for most members of the ecosystem . <p> If you are a customer with a tactical problem working with Vendor Dominated open source is a great solution to get you started and experiment with . - If your problem has the potential to be strategic to your business look at other alternatives that may provide a large , non-vendor dominated base of developers and integrators or price in the risk of vendor lock-in to your long time supplier financial models . <p> If you are a prospective partner for a Vendor Dominated open source project , tactically partner with a vendor who dominates your open source of choice to be **35;698;TOOLONG and use cases . - If customer interest warrants , leverage that partner to provide a stop-gap solution while you buy or build your own . - Realize that if this open source project is successful that your largest competitor may likely acquire the open source ecosystem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you are the ONF create a reference implementation of OpenFlow before its too late see our thoughts for LibOF . <p> If you are Cisco I 'd be surprised if you are not looking at Big Switch already . - If you are a major network or virtualization vendor not named Cisco or VMware the market is early and there are plenty of alternatives ; start identifying and engaging those alternatives before its too late . <p> Lastly , the how and to what level you engage with Vendor Dominated open source may not be a straight line . - Remember that- one size does n't  fit all and what maybe right for you today , may not be right for you tomorrow , or what 's right for your competitors today will be different from tomorrow . - Focus on creating customer value and if you choose to engage with Vendor Dominated open source start working your back up plan . <p> Matt has 20+ years of software-defined networking ( SDN ) , cloud computing , SaaS , &amp; computer networking experience .

You sold one box to many customers , attracting them with varying permutations of features . <p> But hyperscale data centers do n't  want the equipment that 's used in the enterprise data center . High density servers , for example , are crucial in hyperscale circles and exist as a product category solely because of that demand , Weckel said . <p> The key for networking vendors , then , will be to replace Ethernets breadth with specialization .

@@21508198 @1508198/ <h> SDN Does n't  Mean Having to Learn How to Program <p> Just because network operations are moving to a DevOps model does n't  mean everybody has to learn how to program . <p> That was the consensus I was hearing at Interop last week , as I kept trying to stir up conversation about software-defined networking ( SDN ) taking away jobs . Job loss is always a concern when someone starts talking about automating tasks , but some of the people involved in running networks are convinced it wont play out that way . <h> SPONSORED <p> " We already know there are n't  enough people to handle the complexity , " said Rebecca Jacoby , Ciscos CIO , during a media lunch session . Yes , she works for a vendor , but she also runs Ciscos internal networking team , and she thinks SDN is going to increase her staffs importance . " You still need the brainpower to create policy . You elevate the job , and you move resources to do things that are more strategic . " <p> That 's important , because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a job-killer its going to find resistance . " It does n't  matter how great the technology is . Its who 's writing the check and why , " said Christian Renaud , an analyst with 451 Research . <p> Most people seem to believe , though , that networking jobs will move up the ladder , with tedious tasks replaced by more sophisticated work . And it wont necessarily require learning how to program . <h> More Heroes Than Homeless <p> Their view was that engineers will need to broaden their skill sets , rather than focus on getting certified in one vendors technology . ( Cisco CCIE came up repeatedly but just as an example ; as blogger Greg Ferro of Ethereal Mind pointed out , any certification tends to be useful to just one vendors gear . ) <p> Some breadth beyond networking will help , too and yes , that might mean a little bit of programming . Already , human resources departments are looking for skill sets that include some breadth " T-shaped " rather than " I-shaped , " Ferro said . " They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Linux and EngineX , " he said . <p> " Its the return of the generalist , " said Michele Chubirka , a senior security architect who contributes to the Packet Pushers blog and is known to the Internet as Mrs. Y. " It makes the best sense for the business when you can speak the language of each others teams . " <p> Note that the shape Ferro mentioned was a " T , " not a long horizontal bar . Specialties will still exist ; its just that they wont be as rigid . <h> Walking Across the Aisle <p> From that basis , the panel described an organization where different skill sets mingle . Network operators probably wont actually program the network ; that will be more up to server and applications people . But those people will need to tap some knowledge about the network , just as the operations people will need to peek into applications development and the way to do that is to ( hang onto your seat ) actually talk to one another , said Ethan Banks of the Packet Pushers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across the aisle " to those other cubicles , he said . <p> The impediments to this are often organizational . " Senior leadership does n't  always set a good model for their teams to work together , " Chubirka said . <p> From Jacobys perspective , its a matter of moving employees on to the next phase of technology , more than a question of whose job gets automated away . Cisco routinely moves its IT people to other projects anyway , Jacoby says , so no ones unfamiliar with the idea of applying skills to a different job . <p> " You raise the level of what those people are doing , " she said . In particular , automation should reduce the time spent fixing outages that were caused by human error . " That is not work that people enjoy doing , and I think what you do is , you move them to higher-value work . " <p> None of this necessarily means networking skills become devalued . <p> " Network engineers are going to have to change , a little bit , what they 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing the same thing , " said Ivan Pepelnjak , who writes the IP Space blog . He did n't  mean that theyll be doing exactly the same tasks . But when the newly programmable , automated network does something that confounds the applications people , those networking skills will come into play . " That will be one element of our jobs understanding the tools and how to fix them when they break , " Pepelnjak said . 65701 @qwx265701 <p> I think gaining domain knowledge and expertise if way too harder than learning automation scripting or even programming . So , the Network Engineer has nothing to worry about . In fact , I see scenarios where Network Engineers leading DevOps team , so that the junior members of the team can perform the automation scripting tasks . 65697 @qwx265697 65699 @qwx265699 65695 @qwx265695 65696 @qwx265696 65707 @qwx265707

The structure is an open-source foundation , modeled after the Apache and OpenStack Foundations . <h> SPONSORED <p> The foundation ( currently referred to as OpenDaylight ) is expected to be announced around the Open Networking Summit ( ONS ) in April . Daylight has been percolating , according to our sources , for last 4 6 months with final negotiations wrapping up Tuesday at Citrixs Santa Clara headquarters ( which ironically is across the street from the SDNCentral office ) as we broke the story on Daylight . <p> Weve been told the major contributions to the OpenDaylight Controller include : <p> Our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open-sourced under an Apache 2 license and will include critical features such as high-availability and clustering . Weve been told that the initial release is focused on datacenter networks and that control models for other market segments , such as service providers , are futures . <p> Unlike many consortiums , OpenDaylight software development appears to be on the fast-track , as our expectations have been set to see a demo of the Daylights open-source SDN controller at the ONS working with KVM and / or OpenStack and to expect the initial controller to ship by the end of the year . <p> One well placed source has told us that Cisco OnePK is not included though one can expect that Cisco will include the OnePK interfaces and APIs in a future Cisco version of the OpenDaylight Controller . What is also not included in OpenDaylight are any gateways to VXLAN or VMware / Nicira . <p> Independent software vendors : This should reduce the number of SDN platforms / controllers you may have to write to . Very similar to Linux / OpenStack . <p> Losers : <p> Big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , uphill road for Floodlight and the Big Network Controller , meaning its going to be a high bar for customers to justify a purchase of a start-ups controller when a potentially viable open source alternative , supported by major vendors is expected to be less than a year away . As for going forward we should expect to see them focus on SDN apps like Big Tap and Traffic Engineering which solve a real customer need today . Editors Note : Update 2/8/13 : Weve been told by reliable sources that Big Switch is joining the consortium and contributing source code to the effort . Our view is this development is a win for Big Switch to be included with Cisco , IBM , Citrix , HP , etc is a significant milestone . However , based on end customers we 've spoken to , what Daylight means to the standalone controller market and likelihood if customers adopt a controller from a small private company is an open question . <p> VMware : Clearly OpenDaylight was started to build a viable alternative to VMware and specifically the combination of vSphere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the server guys are not going to hand their market to VMware . <p> SDN Start-ups : Unless you have unique product capability and route to market or going after service provider market segments , Daylight has effectively stopped sales cycles until Daylight and its vendor variants arrives in Q4 , 2013 .

What we are consistently hearing is that 2013 will be the year POC , where engineers get their hands dirty with SDN to learn how it can add value to their organization and that they expect 2014 to be a year of limited deployments . We are hearing 2013 SDN budgets are modest $25k $75k .

I again got to chair the closing forward-looking panel , this time with CTOs from Cisco , Brocade and IBM , as well as a couple of CEOs thrown in for good measure . <p> David Ward ( Cisco Engineering CTO ) and I got into an interesting dialog about the interactions of applications and networks . David has been talking a lot about how Ciscos onePK will lead to increased visibility into how applications use networks by leveraging all the data that is available within todays Cisco devices just waiting to be liberated ( I personally believe that data visibility is always unexpectedly valuable ) . 65698 @qwx265698 <h> SPONSORED <p> Davids comments brought to mind a remarkable observation that Peter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Distributed Computing : " ( 1 ) The network is reliable , ( 2 ) latency is zero , ( 3 ) bandwidth is infinite , ( 4 ) the network is secure , ( 5 ) topology does n't  change , ( 6 ) there is one administrator , , and ( 7 ) transport cost is zero . The fact of the matter is almost 20 years later most programmers are just as ignorant about network reality , leading to my question : do you really want such people making meaningful assertions about how the network should operate ? <p> The discussion suggested some useful steps we should take based on increased network visibility that are far simpler and less scary than encouraging programmers to configure the network . In the case of disk drives , programmers understand that data in memory is different from data on a disk , to data retrieved from a complex database system , that data that has to be fetched from somewhere on the internet is different still , and that an application design needs to reflect those differences . I suspect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( or virtual ) networks we can identify a comparably small number of typical network use cases and understand much better how actual network performance also has to be reflected in a program . Perhaps as a result , these different network use categories can be made explicit in modern application design ( or in high level network-utilizing program abstractions ) and the applications needs communicated to the network in that fashion . <p> The next huge " baby " step could be monitor network use by a specific application and build an operating baseline , after which anomalous application behavior or network performance could be flagged . Actual network usage would also give orchestration systems useful information for provisioning and workload movement . <p> Maybe we do n't  really need to program the network ; maybe a little visibility will go a long way especially given where we are coming from . 65700 @qwx265700 65704 @qwx265704 65708 @qwx265708 65706 @qwx265706 <p> Peter is the Research Director of 451 Research 's Networking Practice .

@@21508201 @1508201/ <p> Each time its asked , I realize that its a great question that underscores the confusion that still exists in the marketplace despite our best intentions . The market ( vendors and customers alike ) is still trying to define SDN and gain clarity about how it can help solve significant IT issues . 65698 @qwx265698 <h> SPONSORED <p> SDN is one of the more confusing trends I have personally marketed my way through . It can be fun and invigorating on a good day and frustrating on the days when your conversations are dominated by vernacular and not focused on addressing customer pain . That pain is represented by the manual processes that are fundamental roadblocks to end-to-end , hands-free provisioning . Many of these companies indeed want the network to be part of an orchestration process . They have also maintained that they want to be able to move a virtual machine ( VM ) from one network domain to another . <p> Two different approaches appear to be emerging in addressing these pain points . The under-layer or physical network infrastructure approach is focused solely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solution on a white box or a legacy vendor with your own hardware design ; nonetheless , you care about **28;735;TOOLONG and provisioning the network itself . You might support OpenFlow . And as I noted , these solutions are delivered on a switch . The ASIC in the switch is an integral part of the story . <p> The overlay/virtual network infrastructure approach is focused on building tunnels ( also called overlays ) , and that aspect is called network virtualization . Building virtual network function capability into those tunnels is part of NFV . For example , you may want to connect two isolated domains without changing the underlay and possibly spin up a firewall on that tunnel . These solutions are delivered on an x86 server platform . There are no ASICs , and the rationale is that you can scale here through all of those multicore CPUs . <p> Many prospects are starting to understand the difference and the relevance between under-layer and over-layer segmentation . In some cases , the under-layer focus is what the market is calling SDN . Anything running on a server @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Hey , do n't  blame the messenger ! <p> No matter the approach , network agility is a goal everyone can agree upon . To get there , we must embrace software in networking similarly to how its evolved on the server side . If we all agree on that notion , businesses considering this must ask themselves how they want that spectacular solution served up to them ? <p> Network virtualization and NFV are indeed software-led applications . Having said that , network virtualization and NFV are both delivered to a customer on a server . The association with the network is more in a logical sense only , in that you are controlling or interacting with the flow , or interconnecting logical domains . <p> And networks will always be delivered on a switch . That wo n't change . Switches provide the scale to aggregate all those end devices through protocols that build the fabric that delivers the packets to those end stations . <p> As these software solutions come to market , its important let 's help the market understand if they are switch-based or server-based . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " faster . 65700 @qwx265700 65704 @qwx265704 65708 @qwx265708 65706 @qwx265706 <p> Steve Garrison leads go-to-market , market creation experience and brand development strategies at ZeroStack , and is a seasoned Information Technology executive with nearly 20 years of technology marketing experience .

@@21508206 @1508206/ <h> Look Whos Going to Finish Building the SDN Controller Platform <p> Eighteen months ago , I wrote a guest blog here on SDNCentral where I asked , " Who will finish the SDN controller ? " I was bemoaning the lack of a credible " complete platform " on which to build an SDN software ecosystem , and taking the then-contrarian position that an open-source solution might leapfrog the opportunity to build a big proprietary software business and become the Microsoft of the disaggregated network solution ecosystem . <p> My thesis was that the vision of pioneering SDN gurus like Scott Schenker at Berkeley had not yet been delivered . Go back and listen to his brilliant articulation of the dream , pre-SDN-washing . The barebones research controllers ( NOX , Beacon , Floodlight , POX , Ryu , etc. ) available at that time did not have anything resembling a high-level set of SDN and distributed systems libraries upon which a controller " application " ecosystem could be built . At that time I asked how and when we would finally get a foundation that such an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to supply all of the " me too " bits . 65698 @qwx265698 <h> SPONSORED <p> Since then there have been a number of dramatic changes in the landscape as the ambitious vision and vague definition of SDN have begun to move from slideware to deployable technology . By some definitions , there are 14 or so SDN controller solutions spanning open-source and commercial offerings . Many have made incremental progress towards having a richer , more mature set of services to eliminate much of the low level , error-prone drudgery of building applications and services above the low-level device languages and details . <p> But the emergence of the Open Daylight Project , its community structure and governance , and the contribution of boatloads of near-GA quality source code for diverse controller platform technology have an excellent opportunity to finish building a common platform with the sort of rich APIs and services necessary to appeal to a broader set of network programmers spanning vendors , service providers , and the enterprise . <p> OpenDaylight is an open-source community , hosted by the Linux Foundation , in which anyone is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as in a " we the people in this community " sense , are going to finish the SDN controller . <p> As I write this , developers from dozens of commercial and non-commercial organizations are building and integrating the most comprehensive and programmer-friendly SDN controller platform to date . One can make a strong case that this is the sort of platform originally envisioned . By sharing the core technology platform upon which programmable networks can be built , the vendors have avoided a potential SDK-features arms race that would have nothing to do with their core businesses . In ODP , they each throw a bunch of resources at the open-source platform ( a la corporate Linux development ) , and they all get a higher quality and more widely deployed platform than any of them could build individually . <p> The OpenDaylight Project allows wide latitude in ways to deliver commercial differentiation and value . The net result of building a shared controller platform should be greater innovation and less investment in " me too " for everybody . If all the big vendors getting together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good to be true , you will feel better to know that its in their best interest . <h> Not Your Fathers Open-Source <p> There is no question that this is an atypical open-source community . Back in the day , a bunch of geeks got together and starting building something out of curiosity and common interests , and it evolved into an open community , often lead by a single vision held by a " benevolent dictator " who played the tie-breaker and direction-setter roles . The code grew organically as a community discussion played out about what to build and how to build it . Eventually some of these quirky hobbies became so popular and broadly used that commercial vendors flocked in and built multi-billion dollar businesses . <p> Here , the sequence and roles have been scrambled . The vendors were there at the birth of baby daylight ( artificial insemination as compared to Linux immaculate conception ? ) and huge chunks of functionality were brought to the table largely complete , if not already in beta , leaving little room for the community to discuss design @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Torvalds equivalent in this community who can claim some kind of inherent right to shepherd the flock . <p> As a result of the above dynamics , there is arguably room to question whether the result will be as valuable as , say , Linux has been in the compute world . Obviously there are thousands of servers for every SDN controller , so the total available market is not comparable , but there is hope to get a community-developed SDN platform that is as valuable in that role as Linux has been in the admittedly larger domain . To date , Dave Meyer has been elected head shepherd and is bringing his thoughtful and imminently gentle guidance to the process . While some of the components have been developed outside of the ODP community and imported , they all appear to be well designed by talented and diligent engineers . While the vendors have been involved since the community started , the day-to-day behavior is a pure meritocracy of ideas , with a very simple standard that code trumps debate and whiteboards . Folks are working smoothly to build @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great result . <p> Ignore ODP as a big-vendor trick at your own risk . This is a rare example of realists in the industry risking disrupting themselves to avoid being disrupted by the market shifts that could accompany SDN . It is a sensible move for the incumbents , even if quite unfortunate for at least one of the groups hoping to become the Microsoft of the controller business . It looks like we are going to skip Microsoft and go to Red Hat in the controller business . And Red Hat is has shown up to audition for the role of wait for it Red Hat . <p> Hold onto your seats kids , this ride is going to get even wilder . 65700 @qwx265700 65704 @qwx265704 65708 @qwx265708 65706 @qwx265706 <p> David Lenrow is president and principal consultant at Summit Ridge LLC , currently working with several early stage startups , primarily in the area of software defined infrastructure solutions .

@@21508215 @1508215/ <h> P4 SDN Language Aims to Take SDN Beyond OpenFlow <p> Two pioneers of SDN Jennifer Rexford and Nick McKeown have officially launched a consortium around P4 , a language that allows for programming the data plane . If successful , P4 could widen the scope of the movement that started with OpenFlow . <p> The P4 language has been discussed for more than a year , but it become more " real " on Friday , when the P4 Consortiums plain web site was replaced with a spruced-up version expounding on P4s goals and openness . It also featured a new P4 logo and the obligatory cute mascot a polar bear . <h> SPONSORED <p> Rexford slipped a mention of P4 into her Twitter stream on Friday afternoon . Maybe its coincidence , but by Friday evening , Pacific time , P4.org was temporarily unreachable , as if it had been overwhelmed by traffic . <p> P4 the name comes from the title of a paper : " Programming Protocol-Independent Packet Processors " is noteworthy because of its backers . Rexford is a Princeton University professor who 's been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; she joined the board in October . McKeown , a professor at Stanford University , helped guide the OpenFlow protocol into being , kicking off the current wave of SDN mania . <p> Theyve got equally high aspirations for P4 . " We think its going to change how networking devices are designed forever , " they write in P4s introductory blog entry . <h> An SDN Language <p> P4 is n't a protocol . Its a language for programming the networks data plane , and its used for telling equipment what to do with packets . We described it in March 2014 as a harbinger of what " OpenFlow 2.0 " might look like . <p> That was during the Open Networking Summit , where Rexford gave a talk introducing P4 . ( Her presentation is posted on SlideShare . ) Having witnessed the trajectory of OpenFlow , researchers wanted to intercept some trends that seemed to be approaching the danger zone , such as the rising number of header fields OpenFlow was checking . <p> You could consider P4 the next evolution of OpenFlow . Its certainly got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the chip . <p> Before SDN and OpenFlow , semiconductor design dictated much of what a switch or router could do . It was n't necessarily easy , or even possible , to try out a new packet format or a radical packet-processing method . <p> That left networking at the mercy of the years-long cycle of chip design . These chips are n't  easy , especially at the high end , which is why Cisco , Juniper , and Alcatel-Lucent continue to design ASICs , and why its been so long since Broadcom has had a strong competitor in Ethernet switching chips . <p> OpenFlow began to change that by allowing for arbitrary types of packet processing . These new rules would be fitted into match-action tables : " If the packet matches condition X , then do Y. " <p> P4 broadens that idea by providing an entire language for telling the switch or router what to do . Rather than fill out tables , you would write a P4 program to control the equipment . The program could include add-ons such as analytics . <p> And while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a revolution , Rexford and McKeown point out that chips are already heading in this direction . Theyve become protocol-independent , as far as the hardware goes . And support for OpenFlow has become ubiquitous , meaning the chips are prepared to follow unconventional switching rules . <h> What About Intent <p> Intent the idea of policy-driven networking is getting a lot more of the spotlight than OpenFlow these days , but it looks like P4 can fit into that world . <p> The idea behind intent-driven networks is that an application would state its requirements ( " connect Point A to Point Z and add a firewall " ) , leaving it up to the network equipment to decide how this will get accomplished . <p> You 'll notice a gap there . Somehow , the equipment has to translate this intention into , say , entries in a switching table . P4 could be a language for communicating those changes . The details are still a matter of research , Rexford and McKeown note in their blog entry . <p> P4 also could be considered the conduit for giving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or throttle back to OpenFlow 1.0 , for instance . <h> Keeping P4 Open <p> P4 is just getting off the ground , so the web site is calling for community help to cultivate the new language and investigate its implications . The P4 code is openly available , and the work that goes into developing it will be open as well all available under an Apache license . P4 Consortium membership is free as well . <p> The P4 programs that users write will not be open , however so it will still be possible for vendors or users to amass some intellectual property that does n't  have to be shared . 65701 @qwx265701 <h> Comments <p> Any hardwired packet processing pipeline in an ASIC , no matter how flexible , comes down to a particular architects choice of tables , and choice of the hardware which locks down the number of table accesses done processing a packet , computes the index for each table access starting with bits in the packet , and takes action based on what comes out of each table . ( The more flexible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cores is assigned to actually run code for a given packet . ) <p> My problem with " compiling " a specific set of goals for packet processing , to a very specific hardware pipeline , is that without the person doing the high level programming having a clear understanding of not just the underlying pipeline but the size of each underlying table , is is very easy to write code that " wo n't fit " and very hard to write nontrivial code which does fit . <p> This is true of all abstractions , whether writing Verilog for a very complex function to run in a large FPGA , tuning the kernel ( inner loop ) of a scientific code to run on a particular supercomputer in the 1990s , writing the entire packet processing needs of a nontrivial network in OpenFlow ( as opposed to letting the existing switch code and protocols do their thing and using OpenFlow to override the last few % ) , or now compiling from abstract goals to the contents of the tables in the packet processing pipeline as this article describes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to this problem led to a natural monopoly for x86 ( although those pesky supercomputer inner-loop-kernel writers probably still have to rewrite every time Intel or AMD sneezes ) . My guess is that in hardwired packet processors the same will occur : just as the Stanford paper talks about having to write a different compiler back end for every ASIC ( family ) targeted , that in the end a single packet processing pipeline will have to dominate for this all to work out . I 'm not sure that 's good for customers , or good for our industry . <p> @FStevenChalmers ( speaking for self only ; people at work would argue with me over this ; I happen to work at HP which is in the network business , has done a lot with OpenFlow ; and builds products based on both merchant and our own ASICs ) <p> Thanks for your comment , Steve . Youve got a lot of good points I think one of the underpinnings of P4 would be a more flexible type of chip , maybe even one with tables and a pipeline @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might be working along these lines . 65697 @qwx265697 65699 @qwx265699 65695 @qwx265695 65696 @qwx265696 65707 @qwx265707

So , the vendor is announcing today that its giving away a basic version of ConfD . <p> That version , available now under a perpetual license , uses only the Netconf protocol to configure network equipment . Cisco will continue selling the complete ConfD variety that supports other interfaces including SNMP , JSON , and the Cisco command-line interface ( CLI ) . <p> ConfD had attracted big customers such as AT&amp;T ( which selected Tail-f for its Domain 2.0 program , before the Cisco acquisition ) and Deutsche Telekom , neither of which was particularly happy to see Tail-f lose its independence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equipment providers after June was , We understand the rationale for Cisco to get NCS , but what are they going to do with ConfD ?

NCS has been renamed " Cisco Network Service Orchestration enabled by Tail-f . " ( The renaming happened because Cisco already had a product called " NCS . " For simplicitys sake , this article will continue referring to the Tail-f product as NCS . ) <p> From a business standpoint , giving away Basic ConfD was not so tough a decision . ConfD is an aging product . While customers are creating open source enhancements for it , ConfD itself ( which is not open source ) is not likely to get any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had turned to NCS . <p> Giving away the Netconf version of ConfD has a subtle side effect . Tail-f had hoped to nudge the market toward some standards for network configuration namely , using a YANG data model to describe a configuration , then using the Netconf protocol to deliver instructions to the network equipment . ConfD is the agent that translates between the two . <p> Cisco seems willing to buy into that plan . In other words , the giveaway of Basic ConfD is a vote of confidence in the spread of Netconf . ( An ironic note : Netconfs early champion in the IETF was Cisco rival Juniper Networks . ) <p> And that means Cisco can continue with what had been Tail-fs plan : Use ConfD to get the market accustomed to YANG and Netconf , then let NCS capitalize on a wave of products that can speak Netconf . <p> " What they want to do and what we want to do is move up the stack to orchestration , reaping the benefits of virtualization with automation and self-healing networks , " Lundberg says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ providers , SDN and NFV projects so far have tended to be isolated ; they 're often greenfield offshoots of a network , where they wont affect core operations . NCS would be a way to tie those offshoots back to the older , traditional network , Lundberg says . Network configuration could then be automated so that services could cross the two a service chain in NFV could weave between older , physical equipment and newfangled virtual machines , for instance . <p> NCS will continue to work across vendors , but its also part of Ciscos evolved services platform ( ESP ) . That means Cisco will offer some variations such as pre-integrated versions targeted at particular vertical markets , says Renee Robinson Stromberg , Tail-fs past and current head of marketing . <p> Cisco pledges to support ConfD and NCS as tools that work with multiple vendors equipment .

The companys future path was more likely an acquisition all along , and Cisco is at least pledging to incubate the company and keep supporting it , he says . 65701 @qwx265701 65697 @qwx265697 65699 @qwx265699 65695 @qwx265695 65696 @qwx265696 65707 @qwx265707

Now , cloud providers have made the investment to provide state-of-the-art facilities , experienced staff , and fantastic equipment distributed across the globe . <p> Public cloud offers to lower capital costs and increase on-demand flexibility , but integration across clouds and existing implementations remains a challenge . How can enterprises connect and manage different technologies and systems while simplifying and securing networks spread across both private and public clouds ? 65698 @qwx265698 <h> SPONSORED <p> Overlay-based software defined networking ( SDN ) is proving to be the most reliable way to securely link cloud-based infrastructure with existing data-center networks . In fact , overlay networking uses SDN features to give control over routing , firewalls , and VPN endpoints . This control allows application users to specify addressing , topology , protocols , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> IT teams using overlay networks have the freedom to deploy practically any hybrid cloud resource across hardware vendors or geographic locations . Overlay networks offer security that is fully owned , controlled , and visible , and governed by the enterprise user . Overlay SDN also has advantages of working with existing hardware and software stacks , which preserves investments while offering the security , automation , and control of SDN . <p> Networks , from data-center networks to cloud-based VPNs , can use overlay SDN to disrupt traditional approaches to networking . The InfoPro Wave 5 Cloud Computing Study from 2013 found 38 percent of enterprises surveyed break out cloud computing budgets , while 60 percent include cloud-related spending as part of their enterprise-wide IT budgets . In other words , some firms are testing different cloud strategies and technologies , while others have recognized the need for cloud computing with their production-ready systems . <p> Public cloud infrastructure offers the compute and storage capacity needed to scale up and down and expand the global footprint of the business . IT teams at most companies are also eager @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an ideal playground to test IT teams and business managers concerns . <h> Applying the Overlay SDN <p> Consider a supply-chain-management software vendor based in the U.S. , with customers scattered around the globe . Like most modern IT shops , it wanted to test the public cloud , and specifically the networking capabilities that would connect their existing resources . Starting over in public cloud was not an option , because legacy applications and systems of record tied IT teams and budgets to physical and on-premises hardware . <p> As the business grew , they looked to leverage the scalability of the public cloud but discovered it is still not realistic for most organizations to move enterprise infrastructure to a public cloud . Instead of building a new cloud application and connecting it down to physical IT resources , the team decided to tie production networks and resources together in an overlay network . <p> Furthermore , this network had to scale with the necessary security and connectivity that public cloud providers did not offer as part of their security networking features . To properly link internal infrastructure across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ connectivity and SSL/TLS VPN . <p> Overlay networking allowed this company to construct a joined cloud-based network across public clouds and connect those clouds to existing physical environments . They created a secure , global virtual network for their existing internal IT and customer implementations across the public Internet and provided on-premises solutions for their retail data analysis and management products . <h> How does Overlay SDN work ? <p> Overlay SDN defines the networks in software , meaning designers can operate , control , and configure networks without physical access to the hardware . Effectively , SDN frees the network and applications from underlying hardware . <p> The overlay SDN solution provides Layer 7 control over the Layer 2 and 3 features necessary , such as routers and switches . Overlay SDN users can operate virtualized networks over any type of hardware in any physical location including using overlay networks to unify physical data centers and federate cloud-based applications . Most importantly , overlay networking frees users to deploy practically any hybrid cloud resource across hardware vendors or geographic locations . Overlay networks offer security that is fully owned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ layer where enterprise application owners operate . <p> The costs are less than one might imagine . Traditional networks need a lot of highly specialized resources to carry out configuration and management . The interface to the network had been a trouble-ticket system . Now software defined networks use an API interface , which enterprises can connect into a broader automation and orchestration system . <p> Enterprises are starting to outgrow the pod architectures where they used automated compute within the constraints of statically defined networks ( and storage ) . Automation at greater scale means that everything needs an API , so the time has come for networks ( and storage ) to fit into the software-defined data center ( SDDC ) concept . From a cost perspective , SDN has n't  previously been a premium offering , and might even benefit from greater commoditization in the network equipment space . <p> With overlay SDN , the human skills requirement moves from low-level configuration to higher-level concerns around architecture and integration with adjacent systems .
