Dentists at Aspen Dental practices have been safely and expertly performing root canal procedures for over two decades . <p> Your dentist can help with any concerns , questions , or anxiety you may feel about your upcoming root canal . In addition , here are useful tips for overcoming dental anxiety . <p> According to the American Dental Association : <h> Root Canal Treatment <p> Your teeth are meant to last a lifetime . Years ago , diseased or injured teeth were usually pulled . But today , a tooth can often be saved through root canal ( endodontic ) treatment . <p> Endodontics ( en-do-DON-tics ) is the branch of dentistry that deals with treating diseases or injuries to the dental pulp . An endodontist is a dentist who specializes in root canal and other endodontic treatments . <h> Diagram of a Healthy Tooth <h> What happens if the dental pulp is injured ? <p> The pulp is soft tissue inside the tooth that contains blood vessels and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treatment is needed . The most common causes of pulp inflammation or infection are a cracked or chipped tooth , a deep cavity or filling , or other serious injury to the tooth . All of these can allow bacteria to enter the pulp . <h> Why should the pulp be removed ? <p> If damaged or infected pulp is not removed , the tissues around the root of the tooth can become infected . Pain and swelling often result . Even if there is no pain , bacteria can damage the bone that holds the tooth in the jaw . Without treatment , the tooth may have to be removed . <h> Removing a tooth can create problems <p> When a tooth is removed and not replaced , the teeth around it may shift . This can make biting and chewing difficult and may make it harder to clean your teeth . Areas that are not cleaned well are more likely to get gum disease . <p> Root canal treatment can prevent these problems by saving your natural tooth . Also , root canal treatment is usually less expensive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? <p> Root canal treatment may involve one or more dental visits . Your dentist or endodontist will perform the necessary steps to save your tooth : <p> First , your tooth is numbed for your comfort . A thin sheet of latex rubber is placed over your tooth to keep it dry . An opening is made through the crown of the tooth into the pulp chamber . <p> The tooth 's nerve , or pulp , is removed from the pulp chamber and root canal ( the space inside the root ) . Each root canal is cleaned and shaped so it can be filled . <p> Your dentist may place medicine in the pulp chamber and root canal to help get rid of bacteria . <p> The root canals are usually filled with a rubber-like material to seal them . <p> A temporary filling is then placed in the tooth to prevent contamination of the root canals . You might be given antibiotics if the infection has spread beyond the end of the root(s) . If your dentist prescribes medicine , use it only as directed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your dentist . <p> During the next stage of treatment , the dentist removes the temporary filling and restores the tooth with a crown or a filling to strengthen it and improve the way it looks . If an endodontist performs the root canal treatment , he or she usually recommends that you return to your general dentist for this step . <p> Tooth decay can cause an abscess ( infection ) . <p> The decay is removed and an opening is made through the crown of the tooth into the pulp chamber . <p> The pulp is removed and the root canals are cleaned and shaped . <p> The root canals and pulp chamber are filled . <p> A metal or plastic rod or post may be placed in the root canal to help retain the core ( filling ) material , which supports the restoration ( crown ) . <p> The tooth is then restored with a crown or filling . <h> What materials are used for the crown ? <p> Crowns can be made from several materials . The type chosen depends on where the tooth is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left , your preferences and your dentist 's judgment about what is best for you . <h> How long will the restored tooth last ? <p> When properly restored , a tooth with a root canal filling can last for many years .

Daily cleanings and regular dental exams will help keep your mouth healthy , whether you 've had root canal treatment or not . 12359 @qwx422359 12342 @qwx422342 12350 @qwx422350 12420 @qwx422420

As a veteran myself , this issue is acutely personal , yet it is one that is largely unknown to the general public . <p> While medical benefits are available to all active duty members and veterans through the U.S. Department of Veteran Affairs , dental benefits are not . In fact , veterans do not receive government dental benefits unless they are classified as 100% disabled , have a service-connected dental condition , or have a service-oriented medical condition that is affected by their mouth . These are requirements that many veterans do not meet . <p> In a recent survey , only 44% of Americans were aware of the full criteria that veterans must meet to be eligible for dental benefits through the VA , while two-in-five respondents ( 37% ) believed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to our country . It 's clear that access to dental care is an overlooked issue facing veterans , and the lack of dental benefits can cause them to stay away from the dentist because they ca n't afford it or lack insurance coverage . <p> Only 12% of respondents considered access to dental care to be one of the top three challenges veteran 's face " important issues like readjusting to civilian life ( 63% ) , finding employment ( 61% ) and accessing medical care ( 47% ) ranked at the top . However , what the general public does n't realize is that these other significant challenges are directly tied to oral health . <p> As we all know , the benefits of good oral health are not only physical " as a proper smile can improve self-esteem " they also invoke greater confidence and provide higher employment opportunities , which three-quarters of Americans agree with . <p> It 's clear that our nation 's veterans need help in breaking down barriers to access dental care . It 's why hundreds of my peers and I volunteer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help give several veterans free dental care throughout the year . There was one veteran in particular who truly made an impact on me . After helping to restore his smile , his unbridled enthusiasm was evident , and today he 's helping his fellow veterans with their transition by volunteering at a suicide hotline . <p> The reality is that fixing a mouth can sometimes fix the whole person , giving someone the boost they need to improve other aspects of their lives . Providing them the help they need , specifically dental care , is key in helping veterans transition back into civilian life and continue to serve our communities . <p> Melissa Thompson , DMD , owns Aspen Dental practices in Woburn , Peabody , Medford , and Saugus , Massachusetts .

I have a issue with needles , and the sound of the drill makes me sweat . What is very important to me is people who work in any dental office should be respectful and polite , which I find that this calms me down a bit . I also feel the dentist should be top notch and professional , as well as concern for his patient 's . Aspen Dental , Newburgh , NY has meet all of my expectations , and I highly recommend this place . I got two root canals and caps , and Aspen took care of me and was also concerned . I felt welcomed and part of their team . Thank You ! <p> Everyone is pleasant and professional . The staff makes it a point to explain every thing that is being done in a clear and persice manor . I would recommend Aspen Dental to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! I came in with a broken tooth and extreme dental anxiety . I was treated very well and was n't made to feel bad because of my apprehensions by a single person ... really I visibly shake when it comes to dental work . Going back for my crown in two weeks very willingly . These folks are top notch . <p> I had a horrible experience at the Newburgh location . I came in with tooth pain and left with wallet pain . I was told that the only way to solve my tooth pain was to pay them for services I did n't feel I needed . In true nickel and dime fashion I was told they could help me with financing . I felt like they just cared about the money and not helping me as a patient . I would never recommend anyone to this place . <p> Called due to a discomfort and lump on my gum , which I thought may be abscess . Was given an appointment that day . Had exams , ex-ray . Turns out to be inflammation due to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for thorough cleanup next week . Pleasure so far . Also like that they did n't search for treatment that is n't needed <p> Was my first time at this office . I really do n't like going to the dentist but I had an issue that I had to take care of and I found the people there to be very understanding very cooperative and very upfront . I would recommend Aspen dentist to other people because they treat you like a person not a number . It took me awh ! ile to build up my confidence to go back to the dentist and I 'm glad I did .
