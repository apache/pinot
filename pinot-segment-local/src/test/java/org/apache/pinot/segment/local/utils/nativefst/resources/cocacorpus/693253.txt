But what about the cost to repair your vehicle should you be involved in a collision ? <p> The most expensive cars to repair , according to extensive real insurance claims data collected by the Highway Data Loss Institute , all tend to be high-end luxury and exotic sports car models with six-figure base prices and cutting-edge technology . <p> Here are the top 5 most expensive cars to repair among cars with enough insurance claim data to collect meaningful statistics , according to the HDLI . Keep in mind that these reported crashes run the gamut from the most minor fender-bender to a severe accident resulting in a total loss . <p> 1 . Ferrari California Average Repair Cost : $82,112 <p> In the world of sky-high repair costs , the Ferrari California exotic sports car takes the cake .

Owners , or potential owners , should take some solace in the fact that the California has the second-lowest reported crash frequency of any vehicle on the road . Only the Corvette Z06 is involved in fewer crashes on average . <p> 2 . Porsche 911 Turbo Cabriolet Average Repair Cost : $24,679 <p> Ringing in at second place is the mighty Porsche 911 Turbo Cabriolet , one of the highest-performing convertibles on the market and also exorbitantly expensive in the event of a wreck . It wo n't take much to hit the Turbos approximate $25,000 repair cost , as even a low-speed rear-end collision can cause damage to the cars engine , transmission and other most-expensive components , which are mounted in the back , aft of the rear axle . Like the California , though , 911 Turbo Cabriolet owners tend to baby their cars , with a low claim frequency per year of ownership . <p> 3 .

Its vehicles offer plenty of raw power and visceral driving excitement , sure , but they are better known for their coddling luxury with interiors crafted from the finest materials that money can buy . The $125,000 GranTurismo , a two-seat sport coupe and convertible model , surely has high cost due to factors like Poltrona Frau leather seating and trim : " this superbly finished leather is the result of months of attentive treatment , " Maserati says . <p> 4 . Porsche Panamera Turbo Average Repair Cost : $16,027 <p> Surprise , surprise : another Porsche model makes the top 5 most-expensive vehicles to repair list . The Panamera Turbo , which is the range-topper among Porsches four-door luxury sport sedan lineup , is less expensive to repair per accident compared with the 911 Turbo Cabriolet , though curiously it is involved in twice as many accident claims per car per year . The cars massive size and girth when compared with trimmer exotic sports cars mean more costly raw materials and expensive components needed after the typical wreck . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Rounding out the top five is Nissans GT-R supercar , which while less expensive to repair compared to cars like the 911 Turbo Cabriolet and California , tends to attract drivers who treat public streets as their own personal race track . Not only are claim rates relatively high in frequency , but devastating wrecks resulting in a total loss , or close to it , are more common than with some of the other cars with sky-high repair costs . Coming from Nissan , the cost of individual components will not be as high as from Italian automakers if a major crash can be avoided .

@@10153404 @3353404/ <p> BFGoodrich Tires , the company that created the first all-terrain tire back in 1976 , is about to launch its most capable light truck tire ever this fall The all-new BFGoodrich Tires All-Terrain T/A KO2 . Engineered from BFGoodrich 's championship off-road motorsports racing technology , the KO2 promises to deliver exceptional toughness , durability and traction for traversing harsh conditions , including gravel , dirt , rock , mud and snow . <p> To prove just how capable these new tires are , BFGoodrich could have invited us out to Moab or another off-road destination . But no , instead they brought us down to Northern Baja , where over the course of two days we tackled everything from rocks , dirt , sand and mud as we drove on parts of previous and current SCORE Baja 500 and 1000 courses . Talk about an epic ( and slightly terrifying ) experience ! <p> Now if you follow Baja racing , you know that BFGoodrichs got a rich history with this area , one that started nearly 40 years ago , back in 1975 when their engineers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ radial light truck tire " , a concept that was initially laughed at by die-hard off roaders . The guys from BFG learned a lot during their time in Baja ( like that there was a difference between " laboratory tough " and " Baja tough " ) , so when they debuted the Radial All-Terrain T/A tire the following year , it only made sense to come back down to Baja to prove the durability of this new tire by competing in their first race . The rest is history . <p> So 38 years and 80 Baja wins later , BFGoodrich decided to come full circle by bringing a group of journalists down to Baja to experience the All-Terrain T/A KO2 in its natural habitat . And it makes sense when you think about it .. After all , if the KO2s could handle the grueling landscape of Baja , truly some of the toughest terrain on the planet , they should be able to handle anything you throw its way ! <h> How Does The KO2 Differ From The KO ? <p> Now before we get into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk a little about the tire that we came down here to test . The BFGoodrich All-Terrain T/A KO has defined the all-terrain tire category for decades , so clearly BFG has some pretty big shoes to fill . The KO2s give you what youve come to expect from the KOs , along with better grip on mud and snow , and longer lasting tread life on gravel and asphalt . <p> In developing the KO2 , BFG engineers leveraged the latest off-road racing technology to provide consumers with an advanced tire to meet a range of conditions . KO2 borrows heavily from the BFGoodrich Baja T/A KR2 tire , which was equipped on nine of the top 10 finishers in the 2014 Tecate SCORE Baja 500 . <p> Key features of the KO2 include : <p> 20% Tougher Sidewalls : The KO2 uses CoreGard technology developed in the Baja T/A KR2 for split and bruise-resistant sidewall rubber and a thicker , extended shoulder to prevent sidewall failures . Computer modeling was used to predict object paths and create a sidewall design most likely to deflect protruding objects , reducing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tougher tire as consumers take on trails of various conditions . <p> Longer Treadlife : The KO2 has a new tread design and rubber formulation that helps it last twice as long on gravel and 15% longer on asphalt than the previous tire . The tread rubber has been optimally blended to reduce chips and tears on gravel . A new footprint shape and interlocking tread design provide more uniform wear over the long haul . Special stone ejectors push objects out of the tread to reduce drilling into the tire . <p> Aggressive Traction : The KO2 also has a range of tread features for better mud and snow traction . Side-Biter lugs in the sidewall improve traction in mud , snow and rocks . Raised bars in the shoulder help release compacted mud for better traction in soft soil . 3-D sipes create biting edges for better snow traction . <h> Putting The KO2s To The Test <p> When we landed in San Diego , we were greeted by some BFGoodrich reps who checked us in and gave us some paperwork to go over . Of particular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would provide an airlift back to the States should we need medical treatment . OMG , what did I get myself into ? ! <p> Once everyone had arrived , we boarded a bus and made our way towards Mexico . Two hours later , we finally arrived at Horsepower Ranch in Ensenada , where we had a vehicle introduction and safety session . For the next 2 days , wed be driving Wide Open Baja BC cars and Ford Racing/Miller Motorsports Park Ford Raptors , and they wanted to make sure we knew what we were doing before heading out into the desert . Afterwards , we headed inside for a technical presentation on the KO2s , followed by an authentic Mexican dinner . <p> The following morning , we got our vehicle assignments , donned our helmets ( complete with dust skirts and an air filtration system , since these are open air buggies ) , secured our harnesses , adjusted our seats and mirrors , and got ready to leave Horsepower Ranch . <p> Leaving in groups of five , we headed out of town and onto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1000 , which was a truly exhilarating experience . We covered roughly 200 miles on the first day , experiencing quite a variety of Baja terrain that would have lesser tires begging for mercy . But everyone arrived at Mikes Sky Ranch ( an iconic pit-stop for Baja racers out in the middle of nowhere ) in one piece , though most of us were covered in LOTS of dirt and mud . <p> The following morning , we jumped into our BC cars and left Mikes Sky Ranch by way of Simpson Hill . This was easily one of the toughest trails I 've ever experienced , and it took us nearly an hour to traverse about 10 miles of " road " , if you could call it that . That was pretty gnarly ! <p> Next , we started making our way up to the summit . Now this is the Baja I was expecting , narrow gravel roads with huge drop-offs , and no guard rails to save you if you make a wrong move .

After lunch , we finally got behind the wheels of the Raptors , where we drove along a length of sandy beach , made our way through some local towns , and took on some gravel roads until we reached our final pit stop . While the Raptors were fun , they could n't compare to the BC cars that we had been driving for the past 36 hours , its just a night and day difference . <p> Overall , we were beyond impressed with the performance of the BFGoodrich All-Terrain T/A KO2s , as they handled everything Baja could throw at them with ease . Its clear to see why BFGs motto for the KO2 is " Our Toughest All-Terrain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ T/A KO2 will be released on November 1st , initially in 12 sizes fitting a range of vehicles , including Ford , Chevrolet , GMC , Dodge , Toyota and Nissan pick-up trucks and SUV 's , as well as Plus Fitments for a wide variety of vehicles . <p> The MSRP for the tire starts at $222 .

@@10153406 @3353406/ <h> Review : 2017 Lincoln Continental AWD Reserve <p> For decades , the Lincoln Continental was one of the most desirable and expensive automobiles around , a sign that you had truly made it in the world . But in the late 90s , the Continental started losing ground to the likes of the BMW 7 Series , Mercedes-Benz S-Class , Lexus LS , and after several years of decreasing sales , the iconic luxury car was discontinued in 2002 . <p> But like a phoenix rising from the ashes , the Lincoln Continental is back in showrooms after a 15-year hiatus , and its ready to take on the competition with its stunning good looks , a relatively low price of entry , and that storied nameplate that still holds some value after all these years .. Not to mention , those hilarious Matthew McConaughey commercials that have people talking about ( and buying ) Lincolns once again . <p> When the Lincoln Continental concept debuted at the New York Auto Show in 2015 , it was love at first sight , a sign that Lincoln was back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the production model stayed pretty true to it , save for those awesome rear-hinged suicide doors ( likely due to cost ) . That 's a shame , as that feature is what makes the 60s-era Lincoln Continentals so freaking cool . <p> There 's no question that Lincoln designers had a challenging road ahead of them , taking an iconic car like the Continental and modernizing it for todays consumer while still paying homage to the cars history . But theyve done just that , delivering to us a gorgeous sedan that is distinctive , luxurious , and decidedly American . <p> " Elegant " is the best way to describe the Continentals styling . Its big and imposing ( at 201.4 inches long , its hard to miss ) , but its understated , with just the right amount of chrome accents to make it pop . But the most impressive design feature are those trick door handles that runs along the window sill , as not to disrupt the cars sleek body lines . The handle hosts a small button that unlatches the door electronically . <p> While @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ price tag , those who do n't  need all the bells and whistles can get into a Continental for significantly less money . The base Premiere model starts at just $45,485 . That 's half the cost of a Mercedes S-Class , and comparably priced to a Genesis G80 . Even in top-of-the-line trim , its quite a bit cheaper than a Lexus LS . <p> With three models to choose from ( Premiere , Select , and Reserve ) , there 's a Continental for every budget out there . Our 2017 Lincoln Continental AWD Reserve is the best of the bunch , with every luxury and technology feature you could imagine ( including sumptuous , 30-way adjustable seats ) , plus that glorious 3.0L EcoBoost V6 twin-turbo engine that puts out an impressive 400HP and 400 lb-ft of torque . <p> As you can imagine , this car has plenty of get up and go when you need it .. But do n't  mistake the Continental for a sports car , because that 's not what it aspires to be . This car is all about traveling in quiet luxury , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lose yourself in the music from the 19-speaker Revel Ultima audio system . And it delivers that in spades . <p> The 2017 Continental is just what Lincoln needs to bring the oft-forgotten brand back to relevance , and based on what we experienced during our week with the car ( including random folks coming up to us in parking lots to talk about the car and share fond memories about Continentals from their past ) , they 're off to a good start . <p> We think Lincoln has a hit on their hands with the Continental , bucking the status quo to deliver a truly unique luxury sedan that 's a nice change of pace from the boring sea of Germanic cars on the road today . Its great to see Lincoln step up and deliver that American luxury experience that 's been lacking for so long , and were excited to see what the future holds for them . @qwx142801 @qwx142802

@@10153422 @3353422/ <h> First Drive : 2016 Mazda MX-5 Miata <p> A few weeks ago , Mazda invited me out to Southern California to drive the all-new 2016 Mazda MX-5 Miata , turning me loose on some of the most amazing twisty mountain and coastal roads I 've ever driven . And the fourth-generation Miata did n't  disappoint in the least , handling everything I threw its way with ease . <p> The Miata was originally conceived as a small , lightweight , affordable roadster that is fun to drive , and when it debuted in 1989 , it was wildly successful . But over the years , the Miata seemed to lose its way , getting softer and heavier as it tried to compete with other cars in this segment . The once lightweight car had gained nearly 400 pounds over the years , and drastic measures needed to be taken . <p> So for the new MX-5 , Mazda engineers employed a " smaller , lighter , smarter " methodology , going back to the Miatas roots to build a car that was first and foremost fun to drive . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serious diet , using aluminum panels and lightening components ranging from suspension , front brake rotor , driveshaft , transmission , air conditioning system and seats to she 'd around 150 pounds . <p> But weight reduction is only half the story . Mazdas new high-compression SKYACTIV-G 2.0-liter engine puts out 155HP at 6,000 RPM and 148 lb-ft of torque at 4,600 RPM . The engine also sits lower and farther back in the engine bay for a lower center of gravity and quicker handling response . For those bench racers who are quick to point out that the ND makes slightly less power than the NC , the extra torque and reduced weight of the car more than make up for that fact , with a 0-60 time that 's a full second faster than the third-gen Miata . <p> While the 2016 Miata is slightly smaller on the outside ( it has 45mm shorter overhangs and a 15mm shorter wheelbase ) , its actually bigger on the inside , thanks to some clever packaging . The driver sits 20mm lower , there 's more leg clearance , and high-tension cloth mesh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Its a game of inches for engineers , but for this 62 ? driver , I definitely noticed a difference compared to the 2015 Miata that I drove a few months back . <p> There are three trim levels to choose from for the 2016 MX-5 Miata : Sport , Club , and GT . If you are a driving enthusiast , the Club is the way to go It comes with a limited-slip differential ( on MT ) , Bilstein shocks ( MT ) , shock tower brace ( MT ) , front air dam , rear lip spoiler , and available Brembo brakes/BBS wheels package . These features are n't  available on the GT , which is more focused on luxury and safety features . <p> But enough about the specs , let 's talk about the cars handling characteristics . In a word .. WOW ! <p> We drove the 2016 Mazda MX-5 Miata Club through the foothills and canyons of the Angeles Crest Highway , and the car was unflappable , devouring every corner with aplomb . The Miata is incredibly well balanced , and its REALLY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is dialed in perfectly , giving drivers that nimble handling that they desire without beating them up . <p> Overall , I think Mazda really knocked it out of the park with the 2016 MX-5 Miata .

But do n't  just take my word for it , head on down to your local Mazda dealership and take one out for a test drive one today ! @qwx142801 @qwx142802

The Ford F-450 Super Duty SuperCrew 4+4 now features a maximum gooseneck tow rating of 32,500 pounds , and maximum fifth-wheel towing is increased to 27,500 pounds . Maximum conventional towing is increased to 21,000 pounds and without the need for a weight-distributing hitch . Maximum conventional towing with F-250 , with the all-new trailer tow package , and F-350 single-rear wheel are increased to a class-leading 18,000 pounds . <p> Ford has also equipped the Super Duty with a slew of technology options designed to make life easier for those towing trailers . There 's a center high-mounted stop lamp camera that provides visibility into the cargo box , which is especially helpful when hooking up gooseneck and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four digital , high-definition cameras to give the driver a 360-degree birds-eye view surrounding Super Duty . Trailer Reverse Guidance provides visual cues and tips to help ease backing up a trailer . And an optional trailer camera can be custom-placed on a trailer to improve visibility backing up . <p> Another huge feature that we got to test out was their available adaptive steering system , which reduces the amount of steering input needed at low speeds for easy maneuvering and low-speed agility , and reduces steering sensitivity at highway speeds . The steering ratio continually changes with the vehicle speed , and once you drive a Super Duty with this option , you 'll wonder how you ever lived without it . <p> In addition , trailer towing customers will benefit from a number of driver-assist technologies , including a trailer tire pressure monitoring system , Blind Spot Information System with Trailer Coverage ( checking not only your blind spot , but taking into account the length of your trailer ) , adaptive cruise control that can hold speed even when towing , and lane departure warning . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ covered with their second-generation 6.7-liter Power Stroke V8 turbo diesel engine , which delivers 440 horsepower and a staggering 925 lb-ft of torque . Ford electronically limits the torque in first-third gears to prevent overloading the traction-control system ( or shredding the tires ) , but there 's still plenty of power off the line . We drove an F-350 diesel pulling a 10,000-pound horse trailer as well , and it was so effortless that you almost forgot you were trailering something . <p> We also had a chance to drive a SuperDuty equipped with the standard 6.2-liter V8 engine , which puts out a respectable 385 horsepower and 430 lb-ft of torque , and it was more than capable of handling the off-road course we took it through , powering through whatever we threw its way . <p> If the interior looks familiar , that 's because all three cabs ( regular , SuperCab and Crew Cab ) are shared with the recently redesigned F-150 , giving customers even more room to spread out , along with increased storage space and generous amounts of rear legroom for the backseat passengers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cab models , along with a lockable under-seat storage compartment on Crew Cab models that 's insanely slick . <p> Like the F-150 , the Ford Super Duty is available in a variety of trim levels , from your basic workhorse to ultra-luxurious Platinum and King Ranch models that are clad in leather and have heated , cooled , and massaging seats . A basic , rear-wheel drive , gasoline F-250 starts at $33,730 , while a F-450 diesel Crew Cab 4+4 starts at $55,140 . But as we saw , if go crazy on the options and its possible to get the price up to nearly $90K ! <p> There 's no question that the 2017 F-series Super Duty lives up to its claim of being the " toughest , smartest and most capable Super Duty ever " , edging out their rivals in pretty much every way . If Ram or GM want to stay competitive , theyve clearly got their work cut out for them . @qwx142801 @qwx142802

@@10153440 @3353440/ <h> From Leather to Carbon : A Brief History of Helmet Technology <p> Early motorcycle helmets were more fashion than function . Leather varieties did little more than keep the head warm . Some veterans returning from WWI , and particularly WWII , wore combat helmets . While they may have kept the head warm and proved the outlaw credentials of the rider , they did little to absorb impact . Today , helmets have come a long way in transforming from a mere fashion statement to a true modern marvel . <h> In The Beginning <p> The first crash helmet , introduced in 1914 by Dr. Eric Gardner , was little more than a canvas sheath covered in shellac to handle impacts and , more importantly , to slide along road surfaces . It offered some protection , particularly keeping the flesh from sticking to the pavement , but it did little to absorb impacts . It was n't until 1953 that a true , impact-absorbing protective helmet was patented by Herman Roth and Charles Lombard . While designed for Air Force pilots , the helmet technology was quickly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Common helmets of the 1960s were made of fiberglass and lined with cork to absorb the impact , reports QN Bikes . In the 1970s , face protection and visors were added . Though helmet quality varied , the Snell Memorial Foundation began testing motorcycle helmets and reporting the findings in the late 1950s . And by the early 1970s , nearly all states had motorcycle helmet laws , though some were later repealed , reports the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety . <p> While acceptance from states and riders took decades , modern helmets are comfortable and stylish enough that they are widely used by riders of all types . And with sales projected to reach $851 billion by 2015 , projects Global Industry Analysts , helmet makers are dedicating serious resources to making seriously high-tech gear . <h> Modern Marvels <p> Todays motorcycle helmets may not look like much from the outside , but they 're technological marvels . They have advanced construction to pass and surpass Snell and government standards . The heart of the helmet is the interior absorbing material , usually made of injection-molded polystyrene @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and increase safety and is designed to absorb , rather than deflect , the energy of an impact . <p> While the interior of the helmet is relatively inexpensive to make , the outer shell can utilize advanced designs and materials to improve aerodynamics , decrease weight and bring a fair amount of style . Polycarbonate shells are used in lower-priced helmets , while higher-end versions use featherweight carbon fiber and other advanced materials . Basic models start at about $100 , and increase from there . Carbon fiber helmets cost $500 and up , primarily because materials are more expensive and require much more hand working than molded shells made of plastic . Some models range in the thousands . <h> Military Technology <p> Todays ultra high-tech helmets take a page from fighter pilot technology .

And staying true to their " Find New Roads " slogan , we did just that , embarking on a choose your own adventure journey that allowed us to explore the area ( and the car ) as we drove from Greenville , SC to Asheville , NC . <p> When the 2018 Equinox was unveiled , we were impressed with its fresh , modern design , the all-turbo engine lineup , not to mention all of the connectivity and safety features . But would this be enough to compete in the highly competitive compact SUV market , facing off against the likes of the Honda CR-V , Toyota RAV4 , Ford Escape , Mazda CX-5 , and Subaru Forester ? <p> Absolutely . The Equinox has been a top seller for Chevrolet , and with the new model improved in every way , that 's sure to continue .

For our drive through the Carolinas , Chevy had top-level Premier models with the 1.5-liter engines on hand for us , with both front- and all-wheel drive vehicles to choose from . We drove em both to compare . <p> After getting an overview of the Equinox , we partnered up ( I rode with Mike Meredith from AutoNXT ) , and we plotted a course for Asheville . Our first stop was the Old Esso Gas Station in Landrum , SC , an abandoned but well-preserved vintage Esso Gas Station , complete with an old Esso sign , a Wayne Gravity type gas pump , and even an outhouse in the back .

There are no shortages of waterfalls in this region , but being that we were on a strict timetable , this one made the most sense , as we did n't  have to hike two miles to get there . <p> After getting a few photos , we jumped back in the Equinox and plotted a course for The Gnome Bake Shop in Canton , a local bakery known for their decadent delights , including cream horns , caramel apple cookies , and tasty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brownies . Their famed cream horns were absolutely insane , and I 'm pretty sure I was on a sugar high for the rest of the afternoon . <p> But the best part about going to the bakery was the route that the navigation system had us take to get there ! This 15+ mile stretch of hills and twisting roads through the Blue Ridge Mountains is better suited for a sports car than a compact SUV , but the Equinox handled it with ease . We really pushed the car in this section , and it had plenty of power to get through the hills , and it stayed remarkably planted and stable in the twisties , with no real body roll to speak of . Impressive , to say the least ! <p> The last stretch to our hotel was mainly highway driving , in rush hour traffic .

Power wise , the base 1.5-liter turbo engine with 170HP and 203 lb-ft of torque provides plenty of power while returning a respectable 32 MPG highway / 26 MPG city . <p> Its also chock full of safety features to keep you and your family safe on the road , not to mention the latest in connectivity technologies to keep you plugged in .

Rule 14-6 Let 's say your ball hits into the St. Marks River , but instead of sinking or otherwise disappearing , the ball floats with the current . You can either take the drop or take advantage of Rule 14-6 which states you may strike at the moving ball , but such a strike must be made without delay in order to prevent those who might use a river to improve the balls positioning . <p> 2 . Rule 12-2 It just so happened that you and an opponent are using the same ball brand , and it just so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ balls into the same bunker . When investigating each others position , you find that neither of you can differentiate on who 's ball is whose . Rule 12-2 addresses this case of mistaken identity by insisting both balls are " lost " and that both you and your opponent are to be penalized a stroke and forced to return back to the tee . Of course , you and your opponent can pick up and take back your " lost " balls , but this time you might choose to marker it with your initials . <p> 3 . Rule 10-2b While there is no rule disallowing you to hit another player , Rule 10-2b states that should a golfer hit his or herself with his or her own ball during play , a two-stroke penalty must be administered . <p> 4 . Rule 19-3/1 Not only is there no rule penalizing a player for hitting another , should you happen to hit an out of bounds opponent Rule 19-3/1 allows you to replay the shot if the ball likewise rolls out of bounds . Of course , unwritten and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fore to warn your possible victims . <p> 5 . Rule 13-4/18.5 You just took a fabulous swing and find yourself overjoyed upon seeing your ball fall into the perfect spot upon the green . Only , as you make your way towards the ball , an autumn wind picks up and blows several pine cones onto the green . One of the cones just happens to land right behind your ball . An unfortunate circumstance indeed and one in which you may think easily remedied by simply moving the newly placed object . Yet , Rule 13-4/18.5 disagrees , stating that because this new object was placed by natural phenomenon and not as a malicious act by an outside agent , you must play the ball as it lies , pine cone and all . <p> 6 .

This is a good-looking crossover that has aged very well .

A lot of this comes not from its classic exterior design , which is great in a segment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not a pleasing look , but from its focus on driving dynamics and handling . <p> That 's right . Driving dynamics and handling . In a crossover . Even many of the crossovers that say " sport " on them do n't  measure up to the standard packaging of the 2014 Tiguan . Note I said " standard . " That 's because there is an " R-Line " variant of the Tiguan that puts out more horses , more torque , and has even tighter handling to go with that . VW is owned by Porsche , after all . Hence our title , calling the Tiguan the " poor mans Cayenne . " Its not facetious . <p> Under the hood of this small crossover is a 2.0L inline 4-cylinder engine and 6-speed automatic transmission . You can buy the base model with a six-speed manual transmission if you 'd like . That little engine puts out 200 horsepower and 207 lb-ft of torque .

First , its price tag , which is higher than almost every other crossover in this segment . For that price , though , you get a more premium vehicle than most of the others will offer at their entry-level . Second , the Tiguan has one of the lowest fuel economies in the segment . With competitors like the 2014 Subaru Forester gaining 32 mpg in AWD , the 26 mpg highway that the Tiguan in AWD ( aka " 4Motion " ) achieves seems pretty paltry . On the other hand , nothing in the Forester is as sport-tuned as is the Tiguan . <p> Ultimately , the 2014 Volkswagen Tiguan offers a sleek package that is extremely sporty for the segment along with a build quality and appeal that is far more premium than most of its competitors .

Measurements are stamped onto the underside of each leather corresponding to pants waistband sizes , so its easy to trim the strap to your waist size . Their longest custom size will fit a maximum pants waist size of 48 inches ( full leather length is 55 inches ) . So if you lose some weight , you can just trim down the strap instead of having to buy a new belt ! And if you accidentally trim too much , theyll even exchange it for you for free !

Get rid of that weak point , and your belt will last ten times as long . <p> But that 's not all . How many times have you put on a belt , only to find that it does n't  fit you quite right ? You put it through one hole and its too loose , yet if you go to the next hole , now its too tight . <p> These two problems have plagued me for years , so when I saw the belt pitched on Shark Tank , I was rooting for them to get a deal .

Since there are six inches of retention teeth , you have exactly six inches of variation in your belt , and you can micro adjust down to the desired millimeter . Just shed 5 lbs ? No problem . Just slide the belt tip in another few millimeters and presto the belt is a perfect fit again . To remove the belt , simply lift a retention lever that 's located on the bottom of the buckle and pull the belt out . <p> This video illustrates how the Mission Belt works : <p> Once you try the Mission Belt , you 'll never go back to a traditional belt with holes .

In this way , they 're not just satisfying peoples immediate needs , but giving them the means for an improved standard of living that will last the rest of their life .

Ideal for all mens skin types , the high-tech assortment works alone or in tandem , providing intelligent skincare solutions to anti-aging , shaving , cleansing and basic skincare . <p> Curious to see if the Baxter products lived up to the hype , I requested their free sample pack , which comes with a wide variety of products , as outlined below : <p> Daily Face Wash is a gentle , non-oily cleanser that lathers well and is easy to apply . It leaves a very refreshing feeling without any scent . I also tested this with a Clarisonic style scrubbing brush . The rotating bristles dig deep to exfoliate and the daily face wash is even more effective with this tool . I like this wash , but unless you 're already ordering something from Baxter , I would n't pay shipping for this alone . <p> Vitamin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flavors . They are both small , but solid bars of soap that should be lathered in your hands before being applied to your body . I 'm generally a body wash type of person , but these soaps may turn me over .

I prefer the pear scent , but if you 're looking for one area to upgrade your personal caresoap is the way to go . People who may be used to Irish Spring or some cheap soap by the pound wont know what they are missing until you 've tried a high quality glycerin soap . The mostly clear brick also provides an interesting piece if you have company in the shower .

It is fairly gooey , with a runny consistency that will spread easily in your palm . Little to no scent . Nothing extra-ordinary here , stick to the drugstore specials . <p> Facial Scrub is a rough cutting true exfoliating product . It has bits of ground up walnut shell to remove layers of dead skin and really polish your mug . I compared my face before and after when using this product and my regular St. Ives Apricot scrub and could discern no difference visually or physically .

@@10153515 @3353515/ <h> First Drive : 2017 Fiat 124 Spider <p> Last year , we were lucky enough to drive the all-new 2016 Mazda MX-5 Miata , and I fell in love with it almost immediately . So when FCA invited me to sunny San Diego to drive the 2017 Fiat 124 Spider , I was really curious to see how the Miatas Italian cousin would compare . <p> Many have been quick to dismiss the 124 Spider as simply a rebadged Miata ( much like the Scion FR-S and Subaru BRZ ) , but the relationship between these two cars is decidedly more complicated . As you can see in these photos , the Fiats styling is vastly different from the Miata , taking styling cues from original Spider and reinterpreting them for the 21st century . Ralph Gilles calls the design " 100 percent Italian " . <p> But perhaps the biggest difference between the two cars is what 's under the hood . The Miata is powered by a naturally aspirated , 2.0-liter inline-four ( that puts out 155HP and 148lb-ft of torque ) , while the 124 Spider @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same engine used in the 500 Abarth ) that puts out 160HP ( 164HP in Abarth trim ) and 184lb-ft of torque . That 's a HUGE difference in torque ! <p> The 124 Spider is available in three trim levels : Classica ( $24,995 ) , Lusso ( $27,495 ) and Abarth ( $28,195 ) . <p> We spent the morning piloting a Fiat 124 Spider Lusso around some canyon roads outside of San Diego , and despite the fact that we got stuck with a slushbox , we had an absolute blast ( and got some wicked sunburn ) . The cars suspension is specifically tuned for greater stability while braking and turning , and steering is light and responsive . The cars handling is really second to none . <p> After lunch , we drove over to Qualcomm Stadium , where they had an autocross course setup for us to wring out the Abarth . This was the perfect setting for us to really explore the performance characteristics of the Fiat 124 Spider Abarth and see how it differed from the standard model . In a word WOW @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suspension , and available Brembo brakes , the car is an absolute beast on the track , carving through corners at speed like it was nothing . Afterwards , I turned off the traction control , switched it to sport mode , and proceeded to drift the car around the track like I was Ken Block . The cars balance is just perfect , allowing you to steer with the throttle if you so desire . <p> Overall , I think FCA did a tremendous job with the Fiat 124 Spider , and I suspect you 're going to be seeing a lot of these on the road once they become available . If I were in the market for a new roadster today , I would seriously consider ordering an Abarth for myself ( along with some Mopar Performance Parts to dial things up another notch ) . @qwx142801 @qwx142802 
@@10153517 @3353517/ <h> First Drive : 2018 Lexus LC 500 / LC 500h <p> Lexus recently flew me out to the Big Island of Hawaii to drive the companys new flagship sports coupe , the 2018 Lexus LC 500 . And while I was pretty beat after 13-hours of travel , I was all smiles when we pulled up to the Four Seasons Hualalai and saw a fleet of shimmering LCs parked at the ready . <p> The LCs story began five years ago , when the Lexus LF-LC Concept debuted at the 2012 Detroit Auto Show . With arresting styling and dramatic proportions , the concept had the press , customers and enthusiasts and clamoring for a production version , while staying true to the original concepts design . Lexus accepted the challenge , and as you can see , the results are nothing short of remarkable . <p> For years , Lexus had a reputation for putting out reliable but " boring " cars . But the past 5 years has seen the brand evolve rapidly , with exciting new models like the NX , RC and IS pushing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The LC 500 is the culmination of this process , and based on the reactions this car got from the locals ( every time we stopped , people flocked to us asking questions , taking pictures , and asking us to rev the engine ) , theyve got a real hit on their hands . <p> Immediately identifiable as a Lexus thanks to its hallmark spindle grille and dynamic character lines , the 2018 LC 500 represents the most passionate expression of the brand 's design direction . While the spindle grille has been controversial since its introduction in the IS , it really works on the LC , with a radical new 3D mesh design that changes visual tension as it spreads across the front of the car . L-shaped daytime running lights beneath new ultra-compact Triple LED headlamps create the distinctive LC front lighting signature . <p> The combination of a large glass panel ( a carbon fiber roof is optional ) and blacked-out rear pillars creates a floating roof appearance . The bodys substantial , " planted " look stems from prominent quarter panels that flare away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are pulled inward . The sweeping roofline tapers rearward between muscular , sloping fender tops , underscoring the car 's wide and stable stance , and the spindle shape is repeated in the rear fascia . Large ducts feed air into the rear wheel arches , the airstream exiting smoothly across the tire sidewall to bolster straight-line stability and steering responsiveness . <p> Overall , I think the Lexus designers knocked it out of the park with the styling of the LC . There is no question about it , its one of the sexiest cars on the market today , standing out from the crowd of boring-looking grand tourers in a big way . After all , if you 're spending $90K+ on a car , do n't  you want it to turn a few heads ? <p> For those who think the LC is all show and no go , think again ! The Lexus LC comes in two versions . The LC 500 is powered by a 5.0-liter V8 , and its based on the engine in the GS F and RC F. With an output of 471 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from 0 to 60 mph in 4.4 seconds . The LC 500h hybrid model is powered by an Atkinson-cycle 3.5-liter V6 that puts out a combined system output of 354 horsepower , with a 0 to 60 mph time of 4.7 seconds . <p> Under acceleration , the LC 500 V8 reveals its character in a continuously rising power curve , with the 471 HP developed at 7,100 rpm and the torque peak sustained from 4,800-5,600 rpm . The engine is happiest when you wring it out to redline , and you 're rewarded with a stunning soundtrack , with the standard Active Exhaust rumbling and roaring like a high-performance GT should . The competition just cant compare aurally with their smaller , turbocharged engines , as there 's simply no replacement for displacement ! <p> Power is routed to the rear wheels through a 10-speed automatic transmission , a first-ever in a luxury vehicle . Smaller and lighter than some 8-speed units , this new transmission executes shifts at speeds rivaling dual-clutch transmissions , yet with the seamless performance and smoothness of a torque converter automatic . Paddle shifters allow you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we did n't  really bother with it . And to dial up the excitement to 11 , switch into SPORT S+ mode , which extracts the most from the powertrain and transmission shifts and also fully opens the baffles in the Active Exhaust under acceleration . <p> The LC 500 is the first Lexus to use their all-new , premium rear-wheel-drive luxury platform ( GA-L ) , which will also underpin the new LS sedan , and we were suitable impressed with it . Despite the car weighing a not-so-insignificant 4,280-pounds ( 4,435 lbs . for the hybrid ) and a less than ideal 54/46 weight distribution , the car felt downright nimble in the twisties . Howd they pull that off ? <p> According to Lexus engineers , rather than reducing weight they instead opted to arrange the bulk of the mass ( including the engine and the occupants ) in a position more centralized and lower in the chassis to improve the center of gravity . Couple that with the stiffest unibody the brand has ever produced , along with the LCs multilink suspension system , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handling balance and rock-solid stability . <p> Those seeking an even wider handling envelope can opt for the available Lexus Dynamic Handling system ( LDH ) , which coordinates EPS with Variable Gear Ratio Steering ( VGRS ) and Active Rear Steering ( ARS ) . <p> The interior of the LC is a step above anything the carmaker has done before , and strikes a suitable balance between function and comfort , sporting intent and luxury . The leather-wrapped , three-spoke steering wheel ( with magnesium alloy paddle shifters ) , the hand-trimmed leather shift knob , the suede-covered doors , and the sumptuously curved passenger grab handle , the LC 500 has all the premium details you would expect in a high-end luxury coupe . <p> The front seats offer excellent support and comfort for long drives while available sport seats offer additional bolstering and lateral support during cornering . As for the back seats , they 're best left for small children ( or a briefcase ) , as that sloping roof makes it a bit claustrophobic . <p> The LC 500 also comes loaded with audio , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ screen on the dash , though the latest version of its Remote Touch Interface touchpad control still is n't all that easy to use , especially while driving . Audiophiles will love the optional Mark Levinson 13-speaker sound system , which sounds insane . And the Lexus Safety System+ , an array of active safety features that can help the driver avoid an accident , or help lessen the consequences of a collision , comes standard . <p> All in all , I think Lexus absolutely nailed it with the LC 500/500h , delivering a halo car that combines stunning design , scintillating performance , long-distance comfort and premium craftsmanship . In my opinion , the LC is a total segment buster , and the BMW 650i , Jaguar F-TYPE , and Mercedes S550 Coupe all better watch out . @qwx142801 @qwx142802

Bald ? Nope , missed that one . In love with the V8 massage a tuned rumble crate gives ? Cheyeck . <p> The funny thing is that traditional demographic is only partially accurate for this new 2015 Corvette Stingray .

Men were far more fascinated , of course , but women , young and old , also loved the refined feel and beautiful look of this new Vette . <p> My test drive was a 2015 Chevrolet Corvette Stingray Convertible in Shark Gray Metallic with a beautiful light brown , almost Corsican interior ( Chevy calls it Kalahari ) . The black top folded down to reveal some of the most beautiful leather seats youve ever seen in a sports car that , for all of its storied history and nostalgia , looks as fine as most of the modern European sports cars you might compare it with . Certainly nothing else from Detroit comes close . <p> The Stingray in this new form has a beautiful curvature that begins with the classic , low hood between tall shoulders and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back in a low profile . The big shoulders sway down to a dipping middle and return to heavy hips over big tires at the rear . The entire look of the car , from the side view , is of a woman lying on her side . Its a beautiful combination of strength and sex appeal . <p> Inside , the Stingray has a beautiful interior that combines black faux leather and plastic with continuations of the exterior color inside . This is set off by the beautiful Kalahari leather we spoke of earlier and the optional suede microfiber edges . Although its low and fast , those of large stature will still be able to get in and out of the Corvette and be comfortable once down in the drivers chair . Seating is an excellent combination of comfort in a bolstered sports grip . Everything , of course , is tuned to the driver . <p> When the engine is lit up , it does n't  growl in menace , but instead rumbles in readiness . Its a lovely sound and only a natural V8 can make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ massive 455 horsepower , which is boosted to 460 horses when the ( highly-recommended ) tuned exhaust package is added . A look under the hood shows that the engineering here is simple but very well-executed . Air intakes into a canted radiator from two sources . The top quarter of the radiator is fed by the small grille at front , with the air passing through the top portion of the radiator and then out the hood through vents that create downforce at the front . The rest of the air pulls in from underneath and through the radiator and its fan . This combination creates frontal downforce while the curvature of the car itself creates more at the rear to press down the drive tires . <p> The engine sites several inches behind the steering rack , but does n't  push into the cabin thanks to the small block design and the long , thin transmission that follows . That eight-speed transmission , by the way , is responsible both for a better experience behind the wheel and higher fuel economy along with better speed times than is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than one attempt , I could not outshift or outperform the automatic transmission . That transmission also boosts the rear axle ratio to 2.41 . <p> Now for the good parts . With 460 horsepower , 465 lb-ft of torque , and some of the most beautiful tones you 'll ever hear from a performance exhaust , the 2015 Corvette Stingray launches into a 0-60 , flat-footed , at 4.9 seconds under my tutelage . This was with two passengers . The 0-100 mph was 10.8s and the quarter mile was 13.3s . Thanks to the Performance Data Recorder package , I was able to capture my speed runs and data . The numbers alone , however , do n't  describe the feel of the Vette . <p> Most of my speed trials were on stretch of pavement that has a slight curve in the last third and an incline of about three percent . Starting at the bottom , I would accelerate flat-footed ( no RPM goose , no pre-shifting ) . The launch system in the 2015 Stingray meant that I could literally just jam the throttle down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Lexus IS-F had roughly the same times , but required some feathering at the start to keep from chirping the rear tires and losing grip . This flat-footed launch method on the same road every time gives me a good metric as to which cars can do what . <p> In the Corvette , I was launching from zero and making sixty well before the curve in the road . On that curve , according to the Vettes G-force meter , I was pulling about 1.3 Gs as I turned , usually in the 97-101 mph range . Not once does the 2015 Corvette Stingray ever feel like its going to lose control or require you to slow down on those curves . I took 90-degree turns on other roads at 60+ without flinching . This long , low , powerful car handles exceedingly well " far better than any other American sports car Ive ever been in . Better than many European ones as well . <p> Above all that , though , is the rising grumble and eventual open throated roar that the V8 outputs when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ radio station you can find . What 's more , you can elicit that sound whenever you 'd like , whether cruising along at 70 and then jumping ahead to go around a slower vehicle , or when sitting at the stoplight and launching forward on the green . This latter maneuver , while it might draw the ire of the cops , will often elicit cheers from pedestrians . <p> As a whole package , the 2015 Chevrolet Corvette Stingray is a beautiful , well-engineered rendition of one of Americas best-loved sports cars . The Corvette has always been more than a mere muscle or pony car . From the beginning , its always been a true sports car in every way . While its had some ups and downs in terms of design and capability , this latest generation is likely the best combination of refinement and speed that 's ever been produced .

@@10153555 @3353555/ <h> The Different Types of Truck Insurance <p> When you require a heavy duty vehicle , you need a truck . However , in order to be legal in most states , you also need insurance . When it comes to truck insurance , there are a few different options . The type of truck you have and how that truck is used will affect what type of insurance you need . <p> here 's a look at the different options you can consider , as well as some information about the difference between insuring a car and a truck . <h> Car Vs . Truck Insurance <p> In general , insurance for a truck will cost more than insurance for a car . The main reason for this is that trucks are used in a much different and more extensive way than cars are . Many of these uses put a truck at greater risk of damage and therefore an increased chance of a claim being made . For example , trucks are often used to haul materials or pull a trailer . They may be used in business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accident were to happen while a truck was hauling items or a trailer , this would increase the claim amount , so a truck is considered higher risk and owners are charged more for insurance . <h> Commercial Use <p> If you use your truck for business , then you 'll need commercial insurance . This could be adjusted to include coverage for equipment that is fixed on the truck or for items being carried in it . If you operate a snowplow , then coverage could extend to the plow and give you higher limits in case you cause damage to someone elses property or get into an accident . The same typically applies if you have a tow truck or a box truck . You would want higher coverage in these cases because if your truck were damaged in an accident , it would also affect your business . <p> You may also get special coverage if you drive a dump truck . This coverage will protect you if you have a spill or cause damage to another persons property , along with more general coverage for injuries and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truck , you may be required to have specialty coverage . <p> In addition , if you are only using your truck in certain seasons , like winter for a snowplow , and storing it the rest of the year , then you may be able to lower your coverage in the off months and save on insurance costs . Certain trucks may also have state minimum coverage that it required by law , so it is important to check on carinsurancecheap.net for coverage in your state . <h> Personal Use <p> If you use your truck solely for personal use , then you would need insurance that is similar to what you would carry on a car . You can choose between liability or comprehensive and collision . Most states require liability , which will pay for damage to other peoples property and injuries . Comprehensive and collision will protect you and your property in an accident or in cases of non-accident damage . The main difference , though , between car insurance and truck insurance is that trucks are rated differently . <h> Tips <p> While you will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coverage , its important not to skimp on coverage .

In addition , if you need your truck for work , it is essential to make sure you are well covered so you can easily get your truck repaired or replaced if needed . <p> Its also important that you shop around and compare rates from different companies . This is the best way to find the best value .

@@10153560 @3353560/ <h> Introducing The New 2017 Audi A5 Coupe <p> There 's no question , The Audi A5 Coupe is one of the sexiest mid-size cars on the road today . But the car is getting a little long in the tooth , having been introduced back in 2007 , and receiving a mild , barely noticeable facelift in 2012 . Since then , both BMW and Mercedes have introduced some gorgeous coupes that have surely stolen more than a few sales from Audi . <p> But with the introduction of the new 2017 Audi A5 Coupe today in Germany , Audi looks to turn that around . Why it took the company nine years to introduce a second generation A5 is anyones guess , but were just glad that theyve finally done so . And with the stunning Mercedes C-Class Coupe just recently introduced , it could not have come at a better time . <p> As you can see from these photos , the new A5 trades in its elegant , rounded shape for one that 's a bit more fresh , modern and honed , taking a cue from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lines and muscular surfaces make a strong statement . <p> The new Audi A5 Coupe will launch in Germany with five engines : two TFSI and three TDI units . Their power output has increased considerably and is now between 190HP and 286HP . Compared to the previous model , they offer up to 17% more performance while consuming as much as 22% less fuel . All the engines combine high efficiency with sporty power development and smooth running " especially the two 3.0 TDI six-cylinder engines . <p> With its newly developed 3.0 TFSI , the Audi S5 Coupe is now in a league of its own . The turbo V6 exhibits highly efficient , sports car-like performance and delivers a whopping 354HP ( 21HP more than the outgoing model ) , propelling the car from 0-60 in a scant 4.7 seconds . <p> The new Audi A5 Coupe comes with a drivetrain solution tailor-made for each engine variant . The manual six-speed gearbox and the seven-speed S tronic are used with the four-cylinder engines as well as the 218HP 3.0 TDI with front- or all-wheel drive . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the S5 engine . Both engines come standard with Quattro all-wheel drive . Audi also offers the optional rear-axle sport differential for even more dynamic driving and precision . <p> The all-new chassis is among the strengths of the Audi A5 Coupe . It offers drivers optimal comfort combined with a high degree of agility . The A5 thus handles narrow , winding mountain roads and long trips on the Autobahn with equal aplomb . Audi offers a suspension with damper control as an option . This is integrated into the dynamic handling system known as Audi drive select , which enables the driver to modify the basic characteristic in multiple steps . <p> The Audi A5 Coupe is significantly more efficient than its predecessor . This is due in large part to a reduction in weight as well as sophisticated aerodynamics . The engineers were able to trim the curb weight by as much as 132.3 pounds . The body is the lightest in the competitive field thanks to an intelligent mix of materials and lightweight design . With a drag coefficient of 0.25 , the A5 Coupe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The interior benefits from the increased dimensions and longer wheelbase . Space for driver and passengers is more generous .

High-quality materials in a wide range of colors provide for a particularly pleasant ambiance and underscore the premium character of the mid-sized model . Optional ambient lighting highlights the interior with a choice of 30 adjustable shades . The new A5 Coupe also redefines the class benchmark for aeroacoustics . The acoustic comfort is almost that of a luxury class model . <p> Sadly , the next-generation Audi A5 wont be making its way to the US until next year ( as a 2018 model ) . But on the bright side , that gives you some extra time to save up . @qwx142801 @qwx142802

The price . <p> Well wonder no longer , because FCA has finally revealed pricing for their upcoming Alfa Romeo 4C Spider . The 4C Spider will carry a $10,000 premium over its hardtop sibling , with a starting price of $63,900 . The car arrives at dealerships this summer , and it should be interesting to see how it fares against competitors like the Porsche Boxster S , which has a similar starting price . <p> Some will argue that the Alfa Romeo 4C Spider name recalls the brand 's great sporting tradition , while others will remember the unreliable Alfas of the 80s and 90s that eventually led to Alfa leaving the US . I 'm one of the latter , as I was unlucky enough to own one of those ticking time bombs , an 87 Alfa Romeo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occasions and cost me a TON in repairs . <p> Still , its hard to resist the 4C Spider when you look at its performance stats 0-to-60 mph in 4.1 seconds , a top speed of 160MPH , 1.1 g of lateral acceleration and 1.25 g of maximum braking deceleration . Add in that signature Alfa exhaust note ( which you can hear even better with the open top ) , and suddenly the brands troubled past becomes a bit more hazy .. <p> Complementing the 4C Spider 's exterior are six interior combinations : Black leather with Red accent stitching , Red leather with Black accent stitching , new Black leather with Giallo accent stitching , and exclusive to the Track Package " Black racing leather seats with microfiber inserts and Red or Yellow accent stitching . For a bespoke look , and all new to the 4C model lineup , a contrasting Tobacco leather seat accompanied with a Black leather Interior accented with Tobacco stitching will be offered later . <p> With the arrival of the 4C Spider are six wheel choices , including four all-new wheel designs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) and 18 x 8.0-inch ( rear ) alloy wheels in Silver or Dark Gray finish . For added style and performance , larger 18 x 7.0-inch ( front ) and wider 19 x 8.5-inch ( rear ) forged wheels in Silver or Dark Gray finish are also available . Like the 4C Coupe , the signature five-hole design wheels in 18 x 7.0-inch ( front ) and 19 x 8.5-inch ( rear ) in Silver or Dark Gray are also available . And completing the look are four brake caliper color choices , including Silver ( standard ) or available Red , Yellow , or Black . <p> Lastly , buyers will be able to choose from three available exhaust systems , including the standard exhaust system , a racing exhaust system ( which removes the muffler , and instead integrates a uniquely designed asymmetric Y-shape system after the catalyst ) , and a new Akrapovi dual-mode titanium exhaust system for Alfas most hardcore motorsport enthusiasts will be offered later . @qwx142801 @qwx142802

Their sound quality has also been praised by many . We have yet to experience the Coloud brand , so when they announced their newest sets of headphones , we had to give them a try . Our set of choice was The Boom full-size headphones in gray and black . <p> The first thing you will notice about the Boom is the box . The headphones come in this funky triangular packaging . Not only does it look unique , we say it probably uses less plastic as well . We may not be purveyors of high fashion with our bland gray and black headphones , but Coloud does offer these cans in a plethora of color options including purples , greens , and many more . <p> One of the many features being claimed by Coloud is that these are highly durable . We are not sure if the feel durable so much as cheap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that feels very thin and flimsy , but it has proved very easy to clean , so extra points for that . The biggest issue with the band is the edge where the top and bottom materials meet . It is very sharp and makes the headphones uncomfortable to carry in your hand . Thankfully , the underside of the headband is very well padded . The perfectly round ear cups are also well padded , but they were too small for our ears and became uncomfortable after a time . <p> Another new feature of these headphones is the tangle free system . This means that the Boom has a flat cord and what Coloud calls the Zound LassoG . While we may not be huge fans of the headband construction , this is cord management system is nothing short of brilliant . The Zound Lasso is comprised of some flexible rubber near the end of the headphones , and a small hole that fits the plug . You can curl the headphone plug around on itself and create a secure loop ( Just check the photo . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flat cord that resists tangling , the wires stay tangle free and out of the way . This may be one of the greatest advancements in headphone design this decade . <p> So we do n't like the general construction , but we do like the cord . How about the sound ? This is another area where Coloud has fallen a little short . We have heard large amounts of praise for Coloud 's previous efforts , although we have never experienced them , but these are mediocre sounding at best . They have a very flat and almost muffled sound quality . They do have good volume levels , and there is very little distortion at higher volumes , so there are some good qualities to consider . <p> Despite the seeming lackluster view of these headphones , Coloud has an ace up its sleeve . Price . These Boom model headphones are the highest in the new Coloud range and they retail for a measly $40 .

Thanks to the soft rubbers ease of cleaning , and the low price , I found myself using these headphones for many projects I otherwise might have been music-less .

We give it a good , but not great , score of 6 . <p> Pros : Easy to clean , Zound Lasso is amazing , and rock-bottom pricing <p> Cons : Sub-par sound quality , cheap feeling materials , and can become uncomfortable after a few hours of use . <h> Score : <h> About the author : Christian Moe <p> Christian is the Technology and Gaming guru of Guys Gab , and he also happens to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and big enthusiasm are great ways to describe Christian .

Regardless of where your man cave is located , there are some basic necessities you need to get the most out of your private place . <p> 1 . More Power <p> Even if your man cave is just going to be the basement , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ electrical appliances such as a big screen TV , lamps or some form of lighting and other gadgets . This means , as Tim Allen put it in his " Home Improvement " days , you need more power . This could include installing additional outlets or even a separate circuit breaker , depending on the electric gizmos you are adding to your testosterone-inspired hideaway . Remember , it does not take anything away from your manhood if you need to hire a professional to boost the power . Electrical fires are n't  manly . <p> 2 . Accessories <p> A man cave is more than just a TV with a bunch of chairs or a few comfy couches and a coffee table . A man cave is sort of the new version of what the rec center used to be back in the day . Common man cave accessories include a pool table , theater seating and maybe a few vintage touches such as classic arcade-style video games and a jukebox . Choose accessories that reflect your interests . If you are going for a sports theme , consider @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to scattered around the room or display on the walls . <p> 3 . Manly Materials <p> Pastel walls and color coordinated baseboards are n't  going to cut it in the man cave . A bathroom , for example , may include log cabin of stainless steel walls . Throw rugs , or even a bear skin rug , can add some manly touches to the floor . If you can not do much with the walls , consider adding manly accessories such as a belching clock or pictures and posters with leather frames . The couch itself should be made out of a durable material . Leather is a popular choice . Wood and brick are common choices for the walls in a man cave . <p> 4 . Lighting <p> Unless you are recreating the Bat cave , you are going to need some lighting in your man cave . Consider some creative lighting solutions such as a lighted jukebox or a pool table with a lighted border . If this is n't enough light , there are plenty of manly lamps available . A popular choice is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If you are into nature , consider natural lighting from a skylight or picture window . Recessed lighting , spotlights or ceiling lights are other common man cave lighting options . <p> 5 . Sense of Fantasy <p> Consider going with a theme for your man cave . Before you dive into creating your themed man cave , ask yourself if you can realistically pull it off . Sure , it would be great to have a man cave remade like something out of one of the Batman movies , but can you afford to do this ? If you are a car fan , adding parts of a real car to your decor will certainly give your guests something to talk about . A common theme choice for a man cave is a home theater set up with a movie theater size screen ideal for watching manly movies or the big game in a comfy setting . <p> Before getting started on your man cave , come up with some basic rules . While it may be your room to do with what you please , your spouse may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ single , your whole house is a man cave . Set a budget . This gives you an idea of what your options are before you get started and realize that you can not afford to finish . When you are not in full man cave mode , consider letting the rest of the family enjoy your little hideaway . Sharing can be manly too . <p> Really Scooter6197 , finally there is a place in the house just for men that we get decorate , pick the color of the wall , the couches , theater seating and bar stools and you actually have the nerve to say what about " Her Cave " and you go on to describe it . How amazing you have failed to remember that women have not only one but 2 " Her Caves " and have had them for many decades , they 're called " The Kitchen " and " The Laundry Room " and these are both on top of us letting you decorate the whole house . We just want one room , oh I forgot we get the garage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half of our space there and you cant even keep the kids from swinging open the car door and hitting our trucks . So let 's not be selfish and stop your crying ..

@@10153586 @3353586/ <h> Review : 2017 Ford Fusion Sport <p> Car manufacturers love to throw around the word sport , but in most cases it does n't  amount to more than an appearance package to convey said sportiness . But in the case of the 2017 Ford Fusion Sport , they did the exact opposite . The car looks pretty much the same from the outside save for the extra exhaust pipes , but under the hood its a completely different story ! <p> Taking a cue from iconic cars like the Ford Taurus SHO and Contour SVT , the company decided to drop in their 2.7-liter twin-turbocharged V6 EcoBoost engine from the F-150 , which puts out an explosive 325HP and 380 lb-ft of torque ! And if that wasnt enough , they also equipped the car with all-wheel drive , to ensure that all of that power gets to the road . The result ? The car does 0-60 in 5.3 seconds , with a 1/4 mile time of 14.3 seconds . Yes indeed , the Fusion Sport is one serious sleeper . <p> Ford is n't just gunning for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Fusion Sport , they have also got their eyes set on performance sedans like the BMW 535i , Audi A6 3.0T and Mercedes-Benz E400 . Lofty goals for sure , but honestly I just do n't  see a lot of those people cross-shopping this car . But if they do , theyll find that the Fusion Sport offers quite a bit of bang for the buck . <p> Speaking of bucks , the Fusion Sport has a starting price of $34,350 , and that number can creep up close to $40K depending on options . Still , that 's a considerable savings over some of the German counterparts we mentioned above . But for the " regular " buyer , that 's a lot of money for a Fusion . <p> Still , we like the idea of a sleeper that is wife-friendly ( as opposed to a Mustang , which is " small , impractical , and useless in the snow " , her words not mine ) that can still offer drivers a shot of adrenaline with the simple push of the Sport button on the rotary gear shift @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a more entertaining commute to work . Talk about a win-win ! <p> When you switch to Sport mode , the steering is a bit quicker , the throttle is more responsive , shift points are more aggressive , damping is firmer under spirited cornering to minimize body roll , and the exhaust note is enhanced .. through artificial engine sound that 's played through the speakers . I was n't a big fan of the sound , and I had some passengers that also commented on how " fake " it sounded . <p> Inside , the Fusion Sport looks much like any other Fusion , though the Sport trim includes touches of suede , matte-finished metal , a few chrome touches , and some faux carbon fiber that runs from door to door . While a suede-wrapped or flat-bottomed steering wheel would have been a nice sporty touch , Ford decided to keep it simple . On the tech front , the Fusion is packed to the gills , with an extensive suite of driving assists available ( pre-collision warning , pedestrian detection , park assist , etc ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a trick pothole detection system that catches the cars wheel before it has a chance to drop all the way into the pothole . Automatic high-beam lights in dark areas was another feature that came in handy . <p> Overall , we were pretty impressed with the 2017 Fusion Sport . Its the perfect vehicle for the family man who needs space for the kids , but still wants to have a little bit of fun from time to time . You may have to stop for gas a little more often , as that extra power comes at a cost in terms of mileage . But that 's a small price to pay for being able to do 0-60 in 5 seconds in a 4.000-pound midsize sedan ! @qwx142801 @qwx142802

@@10153596 @3353596/ <h> How To Score With Older Women <p> A lot of the times when I get asked this question it seems that most younger guys think that older women hare harder to get . By older I mean at least 7 or 8 years difference . Guys that have this mentality are around 25 years old and the women are obviously over 30 . <p> Funny enough , its not at all like that . Women over 30 are usually much easier to get . This is true because sadly , their looks are not as good as they used to be and therefore they are n't  getting as much attention anymore . But more importantly , they 've had their fair share of relationships , they do n't  play juvenile games and they know exactly what they want . <p> One of the best things about older women is the fact that they have confidence and maturity . You rarely see these qualities in women especially if you 've only been with girls your age . If an older woman likes you , she 's not going to play games and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to create pointless ways of testing you and working for her attention . Instead , she 's going to show you that she likes you and if that 's the case she 's probably going to go home with you without it being awkward . These women are sexually experienced and do n't  care if their friends consider them a " slut " . <p> What really makes them easier to get is the fact they 're insecure about their looks . Compared to a hot 23 year old girl who is in her prime and is very aware of how hot she actually is , a 33 year old woman , that may be very good looking is less aware of that fact and is more aware of how the 23 year old girl looks younger than her . This is primarily the reason why older women can actually be nervous around you in the early stages of the encounter as they are unsure if you will reject them or not . Because the balance of power is roughly even at the beginning , the pick-up experience is much more enjoyable . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Although they may not be as hot , the other benefits make it worthwhile . You can talk about interesting things as they have an extra 10 or so years of added experience to draw upon . They are sexually experienced and lack many inhibitions , plus unlike most girls around 23 they actually participate in the sexual act . Also , they can and will teach you new things and share valuable points , not just about sex . <p> I had my first older woman when I was 23 and then went through a MILF phase for quite a while . I 've noticed that many guys do this at one point or another and its absolutely great , especially for developing ones sexual abilities . <p> Ok , so here are some things worth looking into if you 're particularly interested in hooking up with an older woman . By older I mean at least 7-8 years older than you . <p> They are interested in outstanding maturity <p> Older women are not going to be impressed by the same things that work on 22 year old . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to do you any good here . Theyve been trough that when they were 20 and had enough of it . They 're also not going to care about your looks so much because the majority of guys that hit on them use hair regeneration treatments . Its quite evident that their standards will be much lower in this category . <p> However , they will be attracted by a younger guy who carries himself with maturity and confidence . Basically you need to act beyond your years . You need to make them think that in 10 years you 're going to be this incredibly amazing man and any girl that will have you is going to be very lucky . Its not much difference than the " investment theory " that works on younger girls but this has to be your prime selling point when it comes to older women . <p> They like to be in control <p> As previously mentioned , these women do n't  have time for juvenile games such as pretending to be less interested when they actually are etc . If they feel genuinely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usually make that clear and quite often you can see them initiating the first move . You need to let them do it . This is how they are and this is what you need to do in order to succeed . <p> Many guys are uncomfortable with this and they start to play games but remember , outstanding maturity is what they want and if you do n't  play it straight these women will quickly lose interest and class you as a kid that 's not worth their time . <p> They appreciate honesty <p> One of the best things about being with older women is the fact that their maturity and experience makes them a lot easier to deal with . Usually , you can be completely honest and they will be fine with it . For example , if you 're only interested in a one night stand , you can straight up tell them the truth and you 'll be shocked by how well they take the statement . <p> Its important to note that , because they 've been through so much in their lives , they will actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women will very rarely view younger guys as relationship material meaning that she 's probably looking for the same thing . However this may change if you spend a lot of time with them and that brings me to my last point . <p> They cant afford to waste anymore time <p> If you enjoy being with an older women , spending a lot of time with her and genuinely have a great emotional connection then you need to be very aware of this one important fact she is n't getting any younger . <p> This means that when a woman over 30 feels that you have some potential and there might be some relationship possibilities , she will speed up the process . They do n't  have time for " Just seeing each other " as they 've already done that at 20 . If they 're over 30 and still single , they had some lengthy relationships that obviously fell apart or may very well be divorced and as a result , they just cant afford " dating " someone for a long period of time . <p> If you continue a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moving in together is right around the corner and kids are not that far away too . Be very careful with this and if you 're only interested in sex , break it off and do n't  waste their time . <p> In conclusion dating older women can be very interesting and rewarding at the same time . They have a lot of new things to show you and in reality its actually not that hard to pick them up . Make sure that you 're honest with them from the beginning so you do n't  have to deal with awkward situations later on . <p> This is the sort of stuff I discuss on my blog and in the free eBook I give out .

Also , I still care just as much as I ever did about the physical appearance of someone I am going out with , I still have to be attracted to the person , just as I always have .. If the full attraction is n't there then I 'm not intetested , and I do n't  care how mature you are . If anything , women get pickier as they get older because not only do we want maturity , but we now know that we need the whole package to keep us intetested .

So when a woman is older and more mature , been there and done that , she has learned that she needs the entire package , even if its just a fling .. Men looking for a fling just want looks in a woman , but women are turned on by more than just looks so naturally there 's got to be a little more going on . The person writing this is acting like you can be so so in the looks department and land an older woman for a fling just by being mature etc .. This is so wrong ! If an older woman in going to just have a fling with a guy then he better be damn hot ! Most woman do n't  want flings , especially an older woman so how would it make sense that she would have a fling with someone she is not ccompletely attracted to ? Young men are already not as experienced in bed so why in the world would they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who was so so looking ? Now , I have to be fair and say that a young man who is looking to to land an older woman will have luck if their not expecting to land a hotter older woman , but if you are looking to land a hot older woman then you better be bringing something good to the table . Most hot older woman are ok with not being as hot as they once were because they know that they still look good and know that they are still better looking than most woman of all ages and that there is no shortage of men to choose from . A hot 30 year old still has her choice of men period ! And a hot 40 year old still has a huge selection of men to choose from and are usually bombarded with attention from men because they are still hot . Now this is not the case with a lot of 30 and 40 year Olds , just as it is with younger woman .. If you are 30 or 40 and unattractive , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and thus being easier as stated from the author . But , on the other hand , this is also the case with younger women . Yes , she might be able to get more attention from older men , but not the kind of attention that she wants from men her own age , so in this case it does n't  help to be young if your unattractive . Anyway , the author of this articlyoungworth listening if you are a young man looking for a fling with a so so looking older woman , but if you want to get with a hot older woman , then you better have enough looks along with the maturity to spark her interest , amongst other things ..

We drove it with the optional Sport Package , which adds 21 ? darkened wheels , some smoke to the chrome work on the grille and vents , light surrounds , etc. , and sport seating with climate controls . Yes , climate controls built into your seats . <p> As far as luxury crossovers go , the Infiniti QX70 stacks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The options get pricey , of course , but this is a luxury vehicle , not a Toyota Yaris , so few will question the $12,000 in options our fully-loaded 2015 QX70 carried . <p> Everything about the 2015 Infiniti QX70 is for going fast and looking good doing it . It powers up on-ramps , glides around corners , and makes muscular sounds while doing so . Passing is commonplace with this one and the kids can sit in the back seat and cheer you on . Truck drivers might have a hard time seeing them pumping their arms for the horn through the darkened glass back there , though . Or maybe its just the blur of speed . <p> Honestly , its not often that one can get into a crossover and say " wow , this is sporty " and actually mean it . Normally , this over-used descriptive gets used on things that probably are n't  all that sporty . I mean , they put a " sport package " on a Versa , for hells sakes .

And with a 25-gallon tank , you can get nearly 600 miles out of a tank of gas , which is pretty darn amazing .. <p> The downside ? You lose a bit of HP and torque . And you 're paying a bit of a premium for the Hybrid over the regular engine . ( But you 'll make up that difference pretty quickly just on the gas savings alone ) <p> As someone who typically drives small cars ( I have n't owned an SUV since the mid-90s ) , I was n't sure how I would feel about the Yukon Denali . <p> But Ive got ta tell you , I felt like a straight up PIMP !

Harley and his childhood friend Arthur Davidson planned to fit a small engine on a regular pedal-bicycle in order to develop a unique motorcycle . It took them a couple of years to complete their project , but they ultimately found out that their machine was not powerful enough to climb the hills without the use of pedals . As a result , their experiment did not work out the way they would have liked . <p> While the experiment might have been a failure , it gave birth to the giant American motorcycle manufacturing company Harley-Davidson . The company faced some difficult times throughout the years , as they had to weather the Great Depression , which preceded World War II and lasted more than a decade . Moreover , there was competition from the Japanese motorcycle manufacturers , so things were not easy at all . Despite that , Harley-Davidson survived and kept on developing some great machines for the users . <p> The vintage Harleys were all about class , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ classic models . Here is a list of some our favorite vintage Harleys , many which you might not have ever seen before . <p> 5D ( 1909 ) <p> Before the year 1909 , Harley-Davidson did not produce any V-Twin engine bikes . They continued focusing on the conventional machines in order to achieve perfection . However , model 5D was the one that really revolutionized things for the company .

It was not manufactured for racing , but had quite a few similarities to the racing bikes . This model had a scooped fuel tank , which made it look quite dashing . <p> JDH ( 1928-1929 ) <p> The JDH was definitely a trend setter and became really famous among the motorbike lovers back in the late 1920s . With a powerful 1200cc , 74-cubic-inch engine , it could go up to 100 miles per hour comfortably , which made people go crazy about it .

@@10153620 @3353620/ <h> Review : Halo 5 : Guardians <h> MULTIPLAYER <p> Halo 2 defined the modern online shooter , and Halo 5 : Guardians picks up the gauntlet , making Halo relevant again in the world of online shooters . <p> From the start , it is important to understand that Halo 5s multiplayer component is split into two major pieces . There 's the competitive , fast and aggressive Arena mode , and there 's the more relaxed and dynamic Warzone modes . <p> For anyone who loves the pure and unfiltered shooter experience that previous Halo games provided , Arena is the mode to go with . Based around small to mid-size maps , Arena sees 4v4 battles that are decided by skill and tactics . Where Call of Duty gives players full control over weapon loadouts and skills that favor long-time players , Halo 's Arena mode gives every single player the exact same starting gear , meaning that there is no unfair advantage to other players beyond pure ability . The maps are littered with powerful weapons to use , but they are constantly marked , so even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't be completely lost when it comes to finding the stronger guns . <p> This new leveled playing field made my time in Arena more enjoyable than I could ever imagine . Even when I found myself in a game where I was being completely destroyed , I never felt upset . I knew I was simply being bested by a better player . Nothing ever felt unfair ot cheap , and that is a breath of fresh air in the online shooter genre . <p> As fun as Arena was , my heart really belongs to Warzone . Warzone sees players enter a huge map that is populated by as many as 24 human players , who are tasked with large goals like base takeovers or reactor destructions . The Warzone mode is made more interesting by the addition of REQ stations that allow players to change their gear and weapons in exchange for REQ points . Basically , each player starts with the same gear , but as the match goes on , they will receive REQ points for killing enemies , assists , and capturing target points @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on bigger and more powerful weapons to give them an advantage . This also adds another layer of strategy to the game . Do you spend your REQ points frequently to get slightly better weapons every respawn , or do you save them up with the hopes of buying a Scorpion tank to help finish off the attack towards the endgame ? So far both strategies seem to be equally effective . The balance is marvelous . <p> While the two 12-man teams face off to complete their objectives , they are also being attacked by a random collection of Covenant and Prothean forces . These NPC enemies are more than just a nuisance though , as each one killed also adds REQ points and scoring , so players who may be less skilled can still help out by decimating the NPC forces and helping to support their team without taking on other Spartans directly . It is just one more facet to an already engaging and well-designed multiplayer experience . <p> With this new REQ system comes the introduction of REQ Packs . These are like packs of trading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used in game . As you play each map you are awarded points that can be used to buy REQ packs , and in these packs you will find new weapons for Warzone matches , as well as new visual items for your Spartan and their weapons . You can also find special booster cards that will provide bonuses like extra experience during certain matches to help accelerate your multiplayer advancement . <p> In a bid to make some extra cash , 343 is allowing players to pay real money for REQ packs . Thankfully , the design of Halo 5 's multiplayer means that even players who spend hundreds of dollars on REQ packs wo n't have a distinct advantage over any other player . <p> While the addition of a microtransaction scheme may give players a sour taste , it wo n't impact the competitive nature of the game , and 343 is also giving every DLC map to players for free . If I had to choose , I would much rather have unimportant visual items as a paid extra , while the useful and fun multiplayer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been hoping for a new , refreshing and better multiplayer experience than what is currently offered on the Xbox One , Halo 5 : Guardians is just what you are looking for . <h> Score 9.5/10 <h> About the author : Christian Moe <p> Christian is the Technology and Gaming guru of Guys Gab , and he also happens to be damn great with auto coverage as well .

But what they do n't  realize is that women do n't  fall for great cars , they fall for great men . If sporty seems a bit too obvious and you 've got money to spare , the Range Rover Evoque is a status vehicle that 's also practical , comfortable and wont ruin her hair like a convertible might . <p> The Penny-Pincher <p> Since were focusing on single men , we should acknowledge that a great many of them are also young and often not particularly wealthy .

Even if you get the most posh and comfortable outdoor furniture possible , you would still be wise to keep in mind that its not usually easy to move .

It was a rugged vehicle that came into existence to support Allied efforts during World War II . Today , the Jeep brand is synonymous with adventure , individuality , and the freedom to go where you please . <p> Jeep 's newest offering " the 2015 Jeep Renegade " not only fulfills these cultural expectations , but due to a number of impressive design features , it does so in a way that will cause even parking-conscious city dwellers to swoon . From its impressive fuel economy to its innovative , open-air , dual panel roof , here are five reasons why urbanites are going to love the 2015 Renegade " even if they 've never considered owning a Jeep before . <h> Its Size <p> The Renegade is the first U.S.-market Jeep ever to be built abroad , and the reason is simple : The new Jeep Renegade will share a platform with the Fiat 500L , which means it 's smaller than your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inside for actual people . For the urbanite who likes to take her friends with her on outings , but who does n't like to stress out about parallel parking , the Renegade 's Fiat 500L Platform coupled with the Renegade 's roomy interior design is a dream come true . <p> At almost 167 inches long and 71 inches wide , it 's smaller than a Camry , which makes for plenty of ease on narrow city streets that require deft maneuvering around cabs , bicyclists , and trash bins . However , that convenient size is deceptive , because the interior actually offers plenty of space . The backseat is actually large enough to fit three adults . <h> Its Off-Road Capacity <p> As a sub-compact vehicle , the Renegade was clearly designed for city use , but because it 's a Jeep and will be sold at dealerships across the country , like **31;0;TOOLONG , the Renegade was also designed with off-road capabilities . Especially for city dwellers who live close to mountains , lakes , and other desirable outdoor destinations , it 's a boon to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's pavement Monday through Friday and on those rugged , dirt roads that come along with weekend trips . With up to 28-inch wheels , all wheel drive , and the ability to drive through up to 19 inches of water safely , this smaller Jeep really can handle your unpaved adventures . <h> Safety <p> As with all Jeeps made in the modern era , the Jeep Renegade provides plenty of safety for you and your friends and family . Not only has the company made use of as much current technology and research as possible when designing the Renegade , but because it 's a Jeep , this vehicle can also get you safely out of bad situations where a different vehicle might stall out or fail to have enough clearance . The Renegade has 70 advanced safety features , from collision warnings that put the brakes on for you to lane departure-warnings that offer corrective steering assistance . In other words , safety is a major feature in this new Jeep , and since most urbanites have seen more than enough fender benders in their day , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prices are n't getting any lower , and there 's no reason to hope against hope they might fall in the future . Instead , it 's a good bet that they will continue their slow and steady climb , while drivers all across America continue to complain . Thankfully , the Jeep Renegade does n't believe gas prices will get any cheaper either , which is why the fuel economy on this vehicle is so good . <p> Projected to get over 30mpg , the Renegade offers the city driver , who likes to head off into the wilderness , not a single fuel-related reason to take the bus . From commuting to camping , driving the Renegade is going to keep more of your cash in your pocket . <h> My Sky <p> The My Sky open-air , dual panel roof is just one of the many impressive interior features that come standard on the Jeep Renegade .

@@10153666 @3353666/ <h> The Player 's Guide To Texting and Calling Women <p> I get loads of emails from other dudes asking me about text game and all that sort of stuff . I agree that texting is a vital part in our society today but it should never be a central way of communicating with women . If you 've read my other articles or have read any sort of material online from experienced pick-up artists you 'll see that nobody says texting is the way to go . <p> On the contrary you 'll learn that phoning a girl is actually much more efficient if you want to set up a date and establish some sort of connection . While there are actually whole books centered on texting women , these are only there because there 's a market for them and people make money selling them to douche bags that think texting is the new calling . <p> I agree there are some situations in which texting is a must and I 'll cover that in this article but I want to stress the fact that these are remote scenarios that can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beyond your control . <p> Its true that calling a chick on the phone can be stressful , which is probably the main reason why most dudes out there text but , it is in reality , just an EXCUSE to be a wuss and not man up and do the proper manly thing . Ive read comparisons saying that talking to a woman you 've barely met on the phone can create similar anxiety like approaching her at a club . Most dudes fear rejection or the fact that she might not remember who you are , or think that the conversation might be awkward or even fear the fact that they might have nothing to say . <p> When you look at it from this perspective , it may seem that texting is indeed the way to go , some might even justify it by saying " all chicks text these days , are used to BBM or just talk on facebook " or " I do n't  want to sound nervous on the phone " or " Texting is much better cuz I can come up with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weak dude on this planet thinks and does the above . To make matters even worse , the chicks know it too ! The moment they see a dude texting her instead of calling she knows he chose the " safe " way of talking to her , because he did n't  have the cohones to man up and ask her on a date and guess what ? Dude gets dumped in the same old basket with all the other weak males on this planet . <p> The other big fear men have when it comes to calling up a woman , which actually makes sense when you look at it , revolves around when to call her and what to do if she does n't  pick up . Most guys think that if she does n't  call you back after you 've called her and you have to call her again , it will seem really needy and you can lose the chick . Or the alternative happens when she calls you back but you miss the call and then you 're stuck in a cat and mouse game that will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ artists refer to that as the phone tag game and were also going to cover how to avoid such things in the article . <p> So , when is it ok to text a chick ? <p> Back in the day , when cell phones came out , they had a neat little feature that home phones did n't  SMS capability . SMS stands for Short Message Service and that 's exactly what YOU should use texts for , to send short messages to the chick . You cant expect to build a massive connection through texts , nor can you expect her to properly remember who you are . Instead , if you call a chick she can immediately hear the voice that made her give out her number in the first place . Now , I 'm 25 years old and in no way old fashioned , but texting should be for short messages only . <p> A fantastic use of a text would be a few minutes after she gave you her number this is a prime opportunity to give her your number ( thus giving her no reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also make some humorous remarks that will help her remember you better . Also , sending her short texts to keep her thinking about you is another good use of a text and so is texting to finalize details before your next meeting ( such as location details etc ) . Basically you should use texts for short messages and phone calls for building a connection and making plans . <p> Having said all this , its time to take a look at those scenarios that make texting a necessity . These are in no way ideal situations and can be often avoided with proper game however there comes a time when if you do n't  text her you 'll risk falling into that cat and mouse phone game that will eventually have you lose the chick . <p> There are scenarios in which a dude calls , she does n't pick up and he automatically texts her . This is a prime example of an insecure male . There are hundreds of reasons why a chick does n't pick up the phone : she is at work , is out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might even be screening her phone for unknown numbers and if you did n't  send that initial text with your number she wo n't have the slightest clue who you are . Regardless of the scenario you should never assume anything and never send a text to explain yourself . <p> Its best to leave a short message ( Hi it 's NAME , you can call me back ) and then WAIT for her to call you back . Wait a day or two and if she does n't  call back send her a text followed by a phone call at a totally different time than before . If she calls you back , great , you 're in but if she texts you instead then you have to change your game to a texting mentality . <p> Its still much better to get her on the phone in order to set up a meeting or to build a stronger connection . Send a few texts here and there and then try to bait her into calling you . <p> Here are some examples : <p> " OMG i have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's too long to text/but text will not do it justice/but texting it wo n't make it work " <p> If she does n't  go for it you can take it up a notch by saying " Are you free for a quick call ? Or are you one of those people who only text for conversation ? " <p> There will always be that small percentage of chicks that ALLWAYS text . You can quickly see this if this is the case after the first few calls , when she texts you back with some sort of excuse as to why she ca n't talk on the phone . Do n't  worry to much about it , just text her and say stuff like " its ok but I like talking on the phone more because text are soo impersonal " or better yet turn it into something productive by saying " Do n't  worry , its cool , I just like phone calls because they feel more personal , anyway this just gives me more reasons to see you in person does n't  it ? " or say something like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how else am I going to know its you and not some 57 year old dude pretending to be you ? " <p> Some chicks will never give any explanations and excuses and will never answer your calls but then text you back . If that 's the case , take it as it is and give up calling this one as its not going to take you anywhere . <p> Another dreaded scenario is when you call up a chick and she does n't  pick up but calls you back later only for you to not be there when she does . Then it goes on and on with you calling her , then she calling you etc . This is sometimes referred to as the phone tag game and its a dreadful thing . Shes only going to call you a couple of times after which she will give up all together . <p> This is another good time when texting is actually useful . Style had a good method of dealing with this which involves sending her a funny text about phone tag and asking her when shell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are some examples : <p> " Phone tag ! You 're it ! When are you around to talk ? " <p> " Clearly we both need secretaries to handle all these calls . Have your people let my people know when you 're free to chat " <p> What 's important to remember is that although calling on the phone is a much better idea than texting , you still need to be able to work both angles regarding your phone game . Every girl is different and has very distinct phone habits , you need to quickly adjust and see exactly what works and what does n't if you want a chance at getting somewhere with the chick . There 's girls that will never answer the phone but call you back after , others wont even call you back unless you text them somethingso its just a matter of finding out what her phone habits are and working with them . <p> Finally , remember that texting should only be a distant alternative for those chicks that just do n't  dig phone calls . Never use texting to build a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phone calls and that is what , in this day and age , shows a chick that you 've got balls plus , it helps get your true personality out there and it makes saying no to an invitation that much harder . <p> This is the sort of stuff I discuss on my blog and in the free eBook I give out .

Especially for a city slicker like myself , since Ive never ridden horses , gone trap shooting , thrown hatchets , or done any of the other manly activities that they had in store for us . But life is all about new adventures , so I packed my bags and headed out to the American West . <p> Our home for the week was the C Lazy U Ranch , an authentic dude ranch located about two hours outside of Denver that has been serving guests since 1919 . Pulling up to the ranch , I was blown away by the endless green meadows , blue skies , and the crisp Colorado air .

We even got to try roping for ourselves , which is way harder than it looks . <p> The next morning , I woke up early so I could watch the morning Jingle Run , where the C Lazy U Ranch horse wranglers bring the 200 horses back in from pasture . It was a pretty amazing sight to see , and you can get a taste of it in this video I shot . The sound of 200 majestic horses making their way into the ranch is like nothing you 've heard before , its pretty surreal . <p> Later that day , we met up at the hay barn for a #SmellEm Behind-the-Scenes session , where we got to learn more about the Old Spice Red Zone Collection , which " transforms men into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in how guys view themselves and how others perceive them , and the new " Smell Em Whos Boss " campaign brings this reality to life in an entertaining way . <p> The Perfect Ending spot you see below features Alberto Cardenas , the face of the Desperado campaign .

He s the absolutely personification of the Desperado lifestyle , and I have a feeling his commercials are going to help sell a LOT of Old Spice . <p> Fun Facts : 92% of Millennial guys think people treat them better when they smell good . And most guys feel that it would be more embarrassing to be told they smell bad on a date than to be locked out of their house naked .

We also took a trip to the Rocky Mountain National Park , which offered some truly incredible sights .

TECHART Power Kits , based on the intelligent TECHART engine management system TECHTRONIC , elicit additional power output for gas and diesel engines . The TECHART Power Kit TA B95/T1 generates approx. 50HP and 50lb-ft of additional power for the Porsche Macan Turbo with a press of the Sport- or Sport Plus button .

The previous-generation Genesis had a very distinct styling all its own , while the new model has a cleaner design that borrowed heavily from Audi and the likes . <p> Still , as a huge fan of the older Genesis sedan , I was excited to see how the 2015 model had evolved . And after a week of driving this stealthy beast pretty much everywhere , I was pretty sad to hand back the keys to the car , as its just that good ! <p> The Hyundai Genesis sedan competes in a crowded segment , going up against luxury cars like the Audi A6 , Cadillac CTS , Mercedes-Benz E-Class , and the BMW 5-Series .

The Genesis also handles great , thanks to some suspension-tuning help from Lotus Engineering . <p> The interior of the 2015 Hyundai Genesis is a HUGE upgrade from the previous model , and itll give some of its competition a run for their money .

All while getting 40 MPG on the highway . <p> But the Hyundai Elantra Eco is n't just about fuel economy , its the total package .

Of course , our first question was " When can we drive it ? " , and that question was answered earlier this month , when I was invited out to Monticello Motor Club to test out the entire RC family ( Lexus RC 350 , RC 350 F SPORT , and RC F ) on their amazing 3.6 mile , 18-turn race track . <p> We were most interested in driving the 2015 Lexus RC F , the brands high performance coupe which faces off against such powerhouses as the BMW M4 , Audi RS5 , and the Mercedes-Benz C63 AMG . Boasting the most powerful V8 performance ever developed by Lexus , the 5.0L engine pumps out 467HP and 388 lb-ft of torque . Its backed up by a close-ratio eight-speed Sports Program Direct Shift transmission and available Torque Vectoring Differential . The RC F does 0-60 in a scant 4.4 seconds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a top speed of 170 mph . Needless to say , this is n't your " typical " Lexus , not by a long shot . <p> Now there are a slew of technical details about the car , and Lexus does a great job of outlining them in their press release , so if you 're dying to know the nitty-gritty details , be sure to check that out . For me , the three important facts were curb weight ( 3958 lbs ) , weight distribution ( 55/45 ) , and coefficient of drag ( 0.33 ) . <p> Lexus developed the RC F to excel on the track as well as the road . Body rigidity , suspension , brakes , tires and all other systems were developed with the expectation that RC F owners would be taking their cars to track day events . And not on trailers , but actually driving their own cars to the track . <p> So that 's exactly what we did , driving the RC F nearly two hours from Westchester to Monticello on a variety of highways and back roads , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In a word Yes . The RC F has a surprisingly comfortable ride , and the exhaust note is also pretty quiet ( until you give it some throttle , and then you 're rewarded with one of the most intoxicating exhaust growl you 've ever heard ) . <p> Once we arrived at Monticello , we had a quick informational session where we learned about the intricacies of the track , and then they let us loose to start driving . I jumped into a Molten Pearl RC F , turned on Sport S+ mode , and waited for my turn to go . I took it easy on the first few laps as I got acquainted with the track , and then I really started to push the RC F. Let me tell you , the car is an absolute monster on the track Its well balanced , has an unbelievable amount of grip in the corners , gobs of power for those straightaways , and the brakes do a great job of shaving off speed in a hurry , with no fade in sight . <p> Visually , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ radical styling and the seven " look at me " exterior colors : Ultra White , Nebula Gray Pearl , Liquid Platinum , Obsidian , Infrared , Molten Pearl and Ultrasonic Blue Mica 2.0 . You 'll either love the styling or you 'll hate it , there 's really no in between here . I think the designers took a real chance with the RCs styling , but they knocked it out of the park . <p> The interior of the RC F has all of the luxury features youd expect from a Lexus , but with a sportier feel . The sports seats are fantastic , supportive yet not overly bolstered , the perfect balance for a car that pulls double duty . The infotainment system is top notch , and the Remote Touch Interface received the same update that the Lexus NX did , replacing the often frustrating joystick with a touchpad that 's a little easier to use . <p> Furthermore , if you opt for the 17-speaker Mark Levinson Surround System , prepare to be blown away by 835 watts of high fidelity . In addition to the great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it also offers Clari-Fi music restoration technology , which reverses the effect of digital compression and brings your music back to life . We got a demonstration of this firsthand , and its really pretty incredible ! <p> Overall , I was REALLY impressed with how well the Lexus RC F performed , both on and off the race track . Its clear that Lexus engineers took the lessons learned from the IS F &amp; LFA and applied them to the RC F , and the result is a world-class high performance sports car that 's designed to be fun to drive for any driver , regardless of their level of driving skill . <p> If I had a spare $63,225 laying around ( that 's how much the RC F starts at ) , I might be tempted to purchase one of these bad boys . But since I do n't  , I 'll have to simply revel in the memories of my day at Monticello with the Lexus RC F. <p> If you 're looking for a fun sports car that you can take to the track on the weekend , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2015 Lexus RC F is just the ticket ! @qwx142801 @qwx142802 
@@10153686 @3353686/ <h> When Aircraft Become Cars <p> We hear a lot about cars that want to be airplanes , but what about the airplanes that aspire to be cars ? <p> Man has dreamed of flying since the day he began walking . The urge to take flight has manifest in many forms , from Icarus and his wings to the Montgolfier brothers in their balloon . this urge has taken .. well .. flight . Eventually , the Wright brothers figured out how to get themselves airborne and aircraft as we know them were born . <p> Once airplanes became relatively commonplace and capable of doing something other than making controlled crashes , automotive designers immediately began looking to them as inspiration whenever words like " streamlining " or " air flow " were muttered . <p> About a decade after the Wright brothers made their first glorified puddle jump , a man named Marcel Leyat invented a propeller-driven car that looked suspiciously like an airplane without wings . <p> From there , it was mostly downhill . With no brakes . <p> 1919 Leyat Helica <p> Known as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appropriate to the cars design . Basically a fuselage with tandem seating , four bicycle wheels , and a huge four-spoke propeller encased in a " protective " ring , the Helica was ugly , unsafe , and totally impractical . In short , it was the perfect experimental machine . A real mans experiment , if there ever was one . <p> This was a weekend garage build gone horribly right . Built out of plywood , the Helica weighed a whopping 550 pounds , some of which was due to its horrendously overpowered 8 bhp engine . It took a while , but in 1927 , the Helica was allowed to drive on the Monthery circuit and reached a top speed of .. wait for it .. 106 miles per hour . Yep . 550 pounds , 8 bhp , and 106 miles per hour . He immediately sold thirty of the things to people willing to risk getting pureed so they could fly on the ground . <p> 1935 Stout Scarab <p> With safety in mind and air travel now a firm part of human nose-flipping at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of designs based on fish , yachts , and occasionally flightless birds . Then came an aircraft manufacturer named William Stout . With such a robust name , he was destined to become the next big thing in automotive . Unfortunately , he was not so good at coming up with catchy monikers for his creations , so the aircraft-inspired Stout Scarab was doomed from the beginning . <p> Most of us would love riding around in a beetle-shaped car modeled after the safety and efficiency of aircraft at the time were it named the Zephyr or the Angel or some such . But scarab ? Even Volkswagen was n't stupid enough to get overly literal with the naming of their cars . Er .. <p> Anyway , the Scarab was shaped like the beetle from which its unfortunate name comes from , but inside it was all about air flight on four wheels . It was piloted by a driver who was separated from his passengers like pilots in an airplane are and had seating for many , but did n't  come equipped with stewardesses . It was powered by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few of the things before giving up . To this day , its believed he blamed the Scarabs failure on its Ford engine rather than his ill-advised naming of the car . <p> When all else fails , blame the outsource personnel . Still works today . <p> 1952 Socema-Gregoire <p> Interestingly , the fish trends in automotive design continued , as fins and O-shaped grille work began to dominate . During this , however , a dreamer named Jean-Albert Gregoire came up with an idea . The Frenchman was already an automotive legend since inventing front-wheel drive in 1920 , pioneering the use of light alloys and aerodynamicism in the 1940s ( largely based on fish , coincidentally ) and so forth . In an epiphany of thought , however , he copied the English and decided to put a jet engine into a car . <p> Unlike the staid folks at Rover , who farted around with gas turbine engines and then saw them as nothing more than explosions waiting to happen , Gregoire was undeterred by mere threats of immolation . After all , France had only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it made sense that they would once again show the world how it was done and build a car powered by jets . The uncouth Americans would totally rip this off a few years later with the Chrysler Turbine , those scabs . <p> Gregoire turned to aicraft maker Socema ( Societe de Construction et dEquipments pour AMaginotnoworkons I think ) and gathered some engineering buddies from various French firms whose names we cant pronounce . Over escargot and cheap wine , they concocted an aerodynamic body that would make Elon Musk green with eco-envy and stuffed a jet turbine inside it . <p> Cranking its turbine to a mere 25,000 RPM , the aluminum-bodied car was capable of no miles per hour because it was in danger of baking itself and whoever was in it . Plus it did n't  have any brakes , which to anyone designing in the realm of badass should be an afterthought anyway . The good news ? The Socema-Gregoire is still up with the times , having its own Facebook page and everything . <p> 1953 , 1956 , and 1959 General Motors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a vacuum . While the French were busy building rocket cars , we Americans couldnt be leaving well enough alone either . Harley Earl , possibly the greatest automotive designer of all time , was working at General Motors , which at the time did n't  have " government " in its name . Name your kid Harley and its guaranteed that he s either going to wind up trailer trash or bitchin awesome . Its kind of a coin toss , but adventurous parents everywhere have taken the plunge . <p> In Earls case , having two first names probably helped him avoid a lot of confusion , so would-be parents take note . His idea was to make something really , really cool , call it a Firebird , and then make a movie about it involving beer and a big rig . Ever since Einstein had solved the beer atom splitting problem , the beer drinkers worries had moved on to issues of transport . So why not fly it on the ground ? <p> Thus the Firebird I was born in 1953 . Although it would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a Pontiac , the idea was all there . Looking distinctly jet-like , the Firebird I had several problems : it only sat one person and it had no cargo space for beer . A few years later , still hard at it , Earl released the 1956 Firebird II , which was far more practical . Plus it had two turbine intakes at the front and a bubble canopy , ensuring that it would forever be associated with comic books . Still not good enough , mostly because the tail fins were way too understated , Harley hit the workbench again and in 1959 , the Firebird III was showcased . Much to the chagrin of beer runners everywhere , though , the vision of hauling bottles of suds had been forgotten in favor of lots of tail fins and big breast-shaped cock-pit bubbles . Which is how the GM marketing department described the cars appearance . In their heads .. <p> 1958 Simca Fulgur <p> While Alfa Romeo was busy building cars that looked like bats , the folks at now-defunct Simca were envisioning grand things involving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visionaries , who were later quelled by Chrysler before they could get too uppity , came up with a car that had all of that and more . In fact , it was so futuristic that it was nothing more than a plastic shell with a glass bubble on top and dreamy literature about a future filled with self-driven cars and electronic brains capable of bringing up maps of anywhere in the world and seeing what was happening on the street when the last car festooned with cameras and gadgetry floated by to beam the information to satellites through a network of electronic brains and intelligent telephones . These people were obviously nuts .

Depending on what you 're using the vehicle for , here are a few things that may help you decide whether you want to go the 4WD route , and what type of vehicle to choose if you do . <p> Need : Let 's face it The percentage of people who use 4WD is but a small fraction of the people who buy a vehicle with 4WD . In general , most of us just do n't  find ourselves in a position to need 4WD . However , if you spend your weekends racing up the side of dirt hills or you commute to work on top of two months accumulation of snow and ice , the question may be moot . Buy it if you can afford it . For the rest of us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most consumers , the basic options will be Full Time 4WD , Part Time 4WD , or All Wheel Drive ( AWD ) . Each system has its own uses , and each provides certain benefits , but all of them will have certain downsides as well . Any 4WD system will increase the weight of the vehicle its in , and this will decrease fuel efficiency . It will also usually make the vehicle more complicated to repair and more expensive to maintain . However , these may be worthwhile sacrifices depending on how you intend to use the vehicle . <p> In 2WD vehicles such as pickup trucks ( unless they are front wheel drive ) there is more weight over the front two wheels ( because of the cab ) than in the rear ( where you have just the bed ) where the drive wheels are .

The problem is that a car that is better equipped at handling snow and ice means there are more drivers willing to venture out into horrible and dangerous weather .

While there 's no way to measure it , it 's fair to say that overconfidence causes a significant number of accidents every year , especially with drivers who have n't learned to drive in poor weather conditions and who think 4WD is all they need . <p> If you do think that you want a 4WD vehicle , here 's what you need to know about the options : <p> 4WD Part Time : Part time 4WD provides a versatile set of options , allowing you to switch from 2WD , to 4WD high , and 4WD low .

You can still choose from the same settings as in 4WD Part Time , but you can run on dry pavement without damage to the vehicle . This type of system is better for people who constantly drive in slippery conditions and do n't want the hassle of switching back and forth . <p> All-Wheel Drive : Similar to 4WD in distributing power to all four wheels , this system has no 2WD function .

They drive an SUV , minivan or a commercial vehicle ( usually a white commercial van , which may be rented inexpensively ) that often displays a company logo . To find suitable targets , the van operators set up their con in moderately-trafficked areas , such as parking lots , gas stations , colleges , or large apartment complexes .

The con artists will repeatedly state the speakers " value " as anywhere between $1800 and $3500 , prices often purportedly verified by showing a brochure or a magazine advertisement . They will usually also have an official-looking website verifying their claims . <p> If the mark declines the offer , the scammer uses various high-pressure negotiation sales tactics .

@@10153696 @3353696/ <h> First Drive : 2018 Toyota C-HR <p> A few weeks back , we flew down to Austin to drive the all-new 2018 Toyota C-HR , the brands eye-catching compact crossover that hopes to lure in young millennials looking for a stylish , fun , and safe vehicle to take them on their next adventure . Ive been eagerly waiting for this car since it first debut as a Scion concept at the 2014 Paris Motor Show . And I 'm happy to report that it was worth the wait . <p> Let 's start with the name . C-HR stands for " Coupe High-Rider " , and designers said its meant to combine the elements of a coupe and an SUV . The fastback roofline and hidden rear door handles nail the coupe angle , while the 18-inch wheels and rugged looking fenders and body cladding give it the appearance of being able to go off-road . But its just for show , with its front-wheel drive setup confining you to the pavement . <p> Styling wise , I think Scion Toyota knocked it out of the park , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ style into Toyotas conservative lineup . Its like a cooler version of the RAV4 , with just enough attitude that a hip millennial would n't be embarrassed to drive one . Sure , visibility from the backseat is pretty poor because the rear windows are super tiny , and that aggressive spoiler cuts down on your rear visibility , but that 's just the price one pays to look cool . <p> For even more flair , buyers can opt for the R-Code option ( $500 ) , which matches a white-painted roof with your choice of a red , blue , or aquamarine body color , the latter of which is exclusive to R-Code models . Its an interesting look for sure , but I was on the fence about it . <p> But where the Toyota C-HR really shines is in the handling department . Deputy Chief Engineer Hiro Koba is a diehard racer , and he wanted the car to " exhilarate its driver anytime , anywhere , including around the famed N++rburgring circuit " where vehicle development was chiefly executed . Turns out , this wasnt just lip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could have ever imagined . Steering is quick for a crossover , and it handles tight turns quite nicely , with little body roll and excellent control . <p> Sadly , this excellent chassis does n't  get utilized to its fullest , as the C-HRs sole powertrain is a 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine puts out 144 HP and 139 lb-ft of torque , with power routed to the front wheels through a CVT . While its fine for getting around town , on the highway I would n't have minded a little extra punch . In Japan , the C-HR is offered with other engine choices and all-wheel drive , and we can only hope that these options become available in the future , as they would take the C-HR to a whole other level . <p> The interior of the C-HR exudes a sporty vibe , with soft-touch materials covering surfaces throughout , a satin-plated shift knob , a leather-wrapped multi-function steering wheel , and a subtle diamond pattern sweeping throughout the cabin . Unfortunately , millennials will be less than impressed with the infotainment setup , as it lacks a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Auto , satellite radio , and navigation . And do n't  even ask me why they put the backup camera image in the rearview mirror rather than on the 7-inch screen . <p> Black is the only interior color that 's offered , and if you were hoping for leather seats or a sunroof , you 're out of luck . This is yet another carry-over from when the C-HR was earmarked for Scion . <p> The 2018 Toyota C-HR goes on sale in April , with a starting price of $22,500 for the XLE model , and $24,350 for the XLE Premium model ( which adds keyless entry and push-button start , heated seats , a blind-spot monitoring system , and rear cross-traffic alert ) . <p> We think the bold crossover offers a lot of bang for your buck , and definitely recommend checking one out if you 're in the market for a new crossover in the near future . @qwx142801 @qwx142802

Felony sexual assault charges on Missouri running backThe Missouri Tigers dismissed their star running back , Derrick Washington , after he was charged with felony sexual assault against a former Missouri athletics tutor . The dismissal was a painful one , to be sure : in two seasons , Washington put up impressive numbers including 1,901 rushing yards and 27 touchdowns . But the University of Missouri has a policy against allowing athletes charged with felonies to play until their cases are resolved . For Washington , that turned into a permanent suspension .

The NCAA slammed Bush when they found out that he received at least $200,000 from a sports agent for playing at USC , a major violation in college football , where pay-for-play situations are strictly prohibited . As a result , Bush was forced to return his Heisman Trophy . USC was hit pretty hard as well , getting put on probation for four years , and vacating several wins from the 2004 and 2005 seasons . They were also deemed ineligible to compete in 2010 and 2011 bowl games . Bushs is certainly a damaging case of temptation and punishment . <p> 6 . University of Michigans money launderingWhile Reggie Bushs damaging pay-for-play transaction was pretty straightforward and simple , the University of Michigans basketball team found itself in a complicated financial predicament . During a six-year investigation , it was revealed that basketball team booster Ed Martin was making payments to players in order to launder money from an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not just the NCAA and Big Ten , but the FBI , IRS , and Department of Justice , with former players called before a federal grand jury . It was discovered that players borrowed several hundreds of thousands of dollars from Martin . The NCAA came down hard on the team , revoking 1997 and 1998 tournament championships and Final Four appearances in both 1992 and 1993 . The team was also placed on probation , and vacated from postseason eligibility for two seasons . Individual players , who had since gone on to become professional basketball players , were punished severely as well , revoking Chris Webbers All-American Honors , Robert Traylors MVP awards , and Louis Bullocks school records . Ed Martin himself was fined and suspended by the NBA after performing public service . <p> 7 . LSU leaders in bar fightTwo LSU football players , quarterback Jordan Jefferson and his teammate , Joshua Johns , were arrested on felony charges following a large bar fight in Baton Rouge that injured four people . They have both been suspended indefinitely from both LSU and the team @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surprising , however , is that their legal counsel seems to condone this behavior . Jeffersons lawyer , Lewis Unglesby is quoted as saying , " Jordan needs to be back playing football . At the end of this , the evidence will be that Jordan Jefferson acted as a leader for his team , doing what he was taught to do , being a good teammate . " Jefferson is accused of kicking someone in the face during the fight . The team has moved on in their season without the help of their troubled leader . <p> 8 . Taking the " pimp " image a little too literallyPlenty of college football players glorify the image of men as " pimps , " but were of the understanding that for most , its just an image , not reality . Berkeley running back Tracy Slocum actually was a pimp , however , and he was arrested by the U.S. Marshal Service after it was discovered that he had been marketing prostitutes for several months . His charges include domestic violence , sexual assault , and of course , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it looks like his future is in jail . <p> 9 . Homophobic altercation , you guessed it , at a barColorado Mesa University redshirt freshman running back Shane Williams got into a fight with a lesbian couple at a Grand Junction bar . Williams apparently made comments about a girl looking like a boy , which led to a fight outside the bar . He was arrested on suspicion of second-degree assault on the victim , who reported a fractured skull , black eye , and difficulty hearing after she was slammed onto the pavement . Things do n't  look good for the young running back , who was also arrested for being a minor in possession of alcohol and possession of a fake I 'd . Formal charges are pending . <p> 10 . SMUs slush fundIn 1985 , the SMU football program was put on probation for three years as a result of recruiting violations , but SMU pretty much ignored the entire thing and just kept on paying players . It was revealed that the payments had continued on a large scale into 1986 , when an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a booster slush fund . Even the schools board of governors got in on the act , ignoring the NCAA to honor their previous agreements with players and devising a plan to keep paying players until they graduated , slowly phasing out the slush fund . But the truth came out , and punishment came down hard . Both the 1987 and 1988 seasons were canceled , and the team was banned from bowl games and live TV until 1989 . Support for the program was cut , and the team lost 55 scholarship positions , as well as four coaching positions . As a result , new players shied away from the scandal-ridden team , and SMU football is still suffering even now . The team did not get a bowl invitation until 2009 , and since 1989 , has only had three winning seasons . <p> 11 . Colorado recruiting and rape scandalsThe Colorado Buffaloes had serious sexual assault issues in the 90s . In 1997 , it was revealed that Colorado football recruiting often involved underage drinking , sexual harassment , and even rape after a woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came of that claim , but in 2004 , sexual scandal broke out against the Buffs again . The teams former kicker , a female player named Katie Hnida , revealed that during the 1999 season , she was the subject of sexually graphic comments , groping , and flashing by a variety of teammates . She was eventually raped by a teammate , but did n't  report the incident because she felt unwelcome among the players as well as by CU coach Gary Barnett . After the rape , Hnida dropped out of CU and fell into depression before returning to college to kick for the New Mexico Lobos in 2002 . <p> 12 . Teammate murder at Baylor UniversityIn 2003 , it was found that Baylor basketball player Patrick Dennehy had been murdered by his former teammate , Carlton Dotson , who shot him during an argument that broke out while the two were recreationally firing guns . Dotson was convicted , and sentenced to a 35-year prison term . That 's the sad , but simple part of this story . During the time Dennehy went missing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ misconduct in the mens basketball team , which uncovered an incredible list of penalties . These included drug use and pay-for-play player support , specifically for the murdered Dennehy . Baylor was severely punished for the scandal , with a probation that lasted until 2010 , and the team suffered from defeat until 2008 , winning a total of just 36 games from 2003 to 2007 . <p> 13 . The NCAAs first death penalty : KentuckyAlthough it seems players are terribly behaved these days , the truth is college sport scandal is nothing new . More than 60 years ago in 1951 , it was revealed that University of Kentucky basketball players accepted bribes from gamblers for throwing the National Invitation Tournament game in the 1948-1949 season . This opened an NCAA investigation into the team , in which it was found that basketball players were receiving inappropriate financial aid , and thus ineligible to play , but were allowed to play anyway . In light of the point-shaving scandal and impermissible financial aid , the NCAA enacted its first " death penalty , " effectively canceling the University @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ban on postseason play for the entire athletic program . <p> 14 . ASU cheerleader pornIn a move that can only be described as terribly awesome , former Arizona State University cheerleader Courtney Simpson managed to link her cheerleading career with her new job as a porn star , wearing her old cheerleader uniform in a pornographic video . Not at all surprisingly , ASU was not pleased about making an appearance in Gina Lynns Double Dutch , and investigated the possibility of trademark and intellectual property infringement . <p> 15 . TCU drug bustIn February 2012 , Fort Worth police busted 17 TCU students in an undercover drug sting , which included four TCU football players . According to reports , police uncovered widespread drug use on the football team , with at least four players acting as drug dealers for players and TCU students . Apparently , drug use on the TCU team was no secret , at least to everyone except coach Gary Patterson , who learned about the problem from a recruit who turned the team down due to the rampant drug situation . This prompted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 82 players failed . The situation is still developing , but we expect to see harsh punishment from Patterson , who shared in a statement that " drugs and drug use by TCUs student-athletes will not be tolerated by me or any member of my coaching staff .

Founded by a group of car enthusiasts with the goal of making the worlds finest supercars accessible to the average Joe , Xtreme Xperience travels across the US offering you the chance to drive the exotic cars of your dreams in its natural habitat on a racetrack . <p> Now as an automotive journalist , I 've been fortunate enough to drive some of the most desirable cars on the market today , but there were still a few cars still on my bucket list that I 've been itching to drive , and Xtreme Xperience was only too happy to help me check them off my list . <p> I opted for the 3-car package ( $659 ) , putting me behind the wheel of a Lamborghini Gallardo LP560-4 , Audi R8 V10 , and a Nissan GT-R for 3 laps each around Raceway Park Road Course in Englishtown NJ . Despite the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was nervous with anticipation when the day finally arrived . <p> When I arrived at the track , I headed over to the Xtreme Xperience registration tent to get checked in . Its a pretty quick process where I gave them my registration confirmation , showed them my I 'd , sign a liability waiver , and got the appropriate wrist bands to signify which cars I was driving . <p> After that , I was directed to a nearby tent for a 30-minute track classroom session , where our instructor went over the track layout and such , gave a quick lesson in racing fundamentals , and then he sent us on our way . One thing our classroom instructor suggested was doing a Ride Along ( $45 ) in their Evo X , as you 'd be able to learn about the track as the instructor coaches you from his perspective , and gives you the insight you need to make your Xperience even better . While I did n't  get to do this , I can certainly see the value in it . <p> Then it was time for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , got fitted with helmets , and then we made our way to our respective cars . I decided to drive the Lamborghini Gallardo first , as that 's the car that I was most excited to drive . My instructor jumped into the passenger seat , and we set off directly behind the lead car . My instructor helped me find the ideal racing line , telling me where and when to brake , corner and accelerate to achieve the optimum speed . This was helpful , as everything wed just learned went right out the window as I flew down the straightaway . <p> Even though Ive done dozens of track days before , this was a new track to me , and his instructions definitely helped me pick up some speed on subsequent laps . Unfortunately , since Raceway Park has a very small and tight course ( 0.85 miles , 13 turns ) , I was only able to top out at 100MPH or so . Now if you did this experience at Michigan International Speedway , you 'd be able to carry quite a bit more speed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ft. long straightaway ( compared to a 1400 ft. straightaway here ) with only 8 turns . That 's something to consider when choosing which track to visit . <p> But to make up for the smaller track length , Xtreme Xperience gave us four laps instead of the normal three , which made everyone happy . And honestly , that was n't a bad thing , as it gave us all even more time to get comfortable with the cars and the track . <p> The four laps went incredibly fast , and before I knew it I was being signaled to pull into the pits . Next up was the Nissan GT-R . I immediately appreciated the extra room in the GT-R ( the Lambo is a tight fit if you 're over 6 ' tall ) , and that was a really fun ride . The GT-R is a car built for the track , and its amazing how the onboard computers work in real time to make you look like a rock star while you rip around the course . The Nissan GT-R is a brute force of savagery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Last up was the Audi R8 V10 . This car REALLY surprised me , delivering the performance of the Lamborghini , with the comfort , class and sophistication that only Audi can deliver . This is a supercar that you can drive on a daily basis , and yet of the three I felt the most confident on the track in the R8 . Maybe it was because I had already done 8 laps on the track by this point , but whatever the case , I was just killing it behind the wheel of the Audi , even passing a slower moving Hurac+n at one point ! <p> Overall , I had an awesome time with Xtreme Xperience .. It was an adrenaline rush like no other , and I 'd do it again in a heartbeat . Next time , I 'm going to drive the Ferrari 458 Italia , Lamborghini Hurac+n LP610-4 , and the Porsche 991 GT3 and knock a few more cars off of my bucket list . <p> So what are you waiting for ?

@@10153715 @3353715/ <h> Movie Review : Chappie <p> In 2009 , at the tail end of a particularly mediocre summer , the world was treated to one of the most innovative films of the decade . This little $30 million sci-fi flick , by the name of District 9 , combined some of the richest Alien mythology ever put on screen with thoughtful social commentary on the horrors of Apartheid , and it 's director , Neill Blomkamp , was lauded as the next Ridley Scott . Six years , and one somewhat disappointing ( but still enjoyable if you ask me ) follow up by the name of Elysium later , and we find ourselves at Chappie , Blomkamp 's final training run before he takes on something bigger with the iconic Alien franchise . <p> Chappie takes place in around 2020 in a South Africa ( what a surprise ) where some of the police force has been replaced with droids created by Deon Wilson ( Dev Patel ) , with a fair amount of success . However , Deon has bigger plans in mind , as he 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but unfortunately , his fickle boss ( Sigourney Weaver ) wo n't give him anything to test it on . Taking matters into his own hands , he steals a partially destroyed droid , but as he 's on his way to test it , he 's kidnapped by three gangsters . These guys ( two of which are played by and share the same names as Ninja and Yolandi from the rap duo Die Antwoord ) need ten million dollars before an evil mob boss kills them , and they think that the childlike Chappie ( Sharlto Copley ) , the being that Deon ultimately creates , just might be the thing to help them pull of the perfect heist . <p> Chappie certainly is n't mining anything particularly new conceptually , as the whole childlike robot growing into itself trope has been mauled over time and time again . However , Blomkamp seems very aware of this , and seems determined to take Chappie in thoughtful and original directions throughout . This is his somber , darkly humorous , hard-R version of a fairy tale , and as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Chappie is such a fascinating character , a childlike mind constantly being ripped between different ideologies . Deon wants him to engage his creativity , Yolandi wants him to learn slowly , and Ninja wants him to become tough and ruthless , and as an impressionable baby he is constantly trying to adapt to each person , regardless of how smart he ends up becoming . Watching this transformation and conflict is all the more interesting due to Copley 's absolutely wonderful performance , where he not only does brilliant work establishing Chappie 's movement , but by also melding innocence with intelligence . <p> To my utter surprise , the supporting cast is also very strong . I normally find Dev Patel as bland as a bunch of rocks , but here he gives a rich and soulful turn as a man who just wants his creation to be a good man/robot , and will stop at nothing to engage Chappie 's morality . Also , while there was a great deal of well founded skepticism in casting Die Antwoord , these two actually ended up being up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrong , they 're not Shakespearian level or anything , but they fit the roles they 're given , and make the best of it .

@@10153718 @3353718/ <h> Movie Review : Sicario <p> Sicario is not the kind of film to make pretenses about . The movie opens with one of the most intense and brutal drug raid sequences ever put on film , establishing that this is going to be a story that shows the gritty realities these people on both sides of the law have to live . Coming from Prisoners director Denis Villeneuve , this striking brutality should n't be a surprise . It 's a hauntingly beautiful first sequence that sets the tone for what should be a movie on the level of the all time great crime films . However , the problem with having such a gripping opening is keeping up that momentum throughout the rest of it 's two hours . How are they going to keep us from cowering from these blood soaked deserts of Juarez and El Paso ? <p> The film centers on FBI agent Kate Macer ( Emily Blunt ) , who is traumatized when the aforementioned raid results in the savage deaths of some fellow agents . She finds herself mixed in with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leader of a task force that 's assigned to bring down Manuel Diaz ( Bernardo P. Saracino ) , the crime lord at the head of the organization responsible for those deaths . Almost immediately , Kate feels like she 's being kept out of the loop on the operation . Matt seems to be much more in league with Alejandro Gillick ( Benicio Del Toro ) , a former cartel mercenary turned agent who 's loyalties and motivations seem murky . <p> This is one of the most beautiful looking and spectacularly directed movies of the year thus far . Villeneuve established himself as a master of establishing atmosphere with Prisoners and builds on that here . There are long sequences that are nothing but just our characters taking in the horrific sights of wherever they are . With the sheer craft that he and master cinematographer Roger Deakins move their camera , were just as terrified as the characters . The film is often times more of a graphic mood piece than anything , and these are it 's strongest moments . Villeneuve and screenwriter Taylor Sheridan also do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The story is crafted in such a way that just as she is having information withheld from her , we the audience are too , and it 's just as frustrating for us as it is for her . <p> Unfortunately , it is in Kate that the film is also the most flawed . Emily Blunt is as game as always , giving a heartfelt and authentic performance , but the character really is n't given a satisfying arc . She spends the whole movie getting pushed aside , beaten up , and generally humiliated like a little girl on the playground when the boys are playing freeze tag . Never does she get that moment of defiance that would make all of that worth it , she just sort of cowers in the corner . <p> All of the really satisfying character work is reserved for Del Toro , who excels in the skin of the calculating and threatening Alejandro . Meanwhile , Brolin is certainly serviceable in his role , but never gets much depth beyond being the gung-ho team leader . This story feels like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ army-woman that is always forced to the background in other action movies . While that 's certainly an interesting approach , it simply never pays off in a way that makes it fully satisfying . <p> The best moments here are the action sequences , which are incredibly tense and beautifully choreographed . Villeneuve relishes in playing with the moment before the big shootout breaks out . Those tense stare downs and confined spaces that start to make people nervous . All of the violence here feels scary and every gunshot has a massive impact . Even for those who are adverse to a slower pace of action will feel satisfied by the last twenty minutes , when Del Toro gets his absolutely sensational time to shine . This is a movie that will leave you with at least a couple chilling images running around the brain . <p> Sicario is a very good movie that feels like it 's just chomping at the bit to be great .

But the exterior changes are more evolutionary than revolutionary , taking a trained eye to distinguish new model from old on the streets . <p> A few weeks ago , Volkswagen brought us up to Vermont to experience the new Passat for ourselves , and we spent the day putting the 1.8T model through its paces .

Fuel economy The 1.8T gets 25 mpg city/38 mpg highway ( an improvement of 2 mpg over the 2015 Passat 1.8T ) while the VR6 gets 28 mpg on the highway .

Slimmer headlights , a more substantial fully chromed four-bar grille , and a sculpted , domed hood all work together to give the Passat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In addition , standard chrome window surrounds and door trim add to the premium nature of the design , as do available LED headlights and taillights . <p> At the rear , a new bumper and trunk lid help to shape the 2016 Passats new look .

This sporty model features unique rocker panels , a stylized front bumper with contrasting black accents , a modified rear diffuser , and anthracite-color Salvador aluminum-alloy 19-inch wheels shod with 235/40 all-season tires . This is the model to get if you want to turn some heads on the streets . <p> The inside of the 2016 Passat was designed and specifically tailored for the US market .

And VWs available Car-Net App-Connect technology allows integration with Apple CarPlay , Android Auto and MirrorLink . <p> On the road , the 2016 Volkswagen Passat performed very well , with dynamic handling and precise steering , both reminders that you 're driving a German car .

The choice of materials and the finish have a hand-crafted feel with high-class appeal and deliver a new take on modern luxury : sportiness without compromising on comfort and exquisite style . <p> With a 3.1 inch ( 80mm ) longer wheelbase , the C-Class Coupe is 3.7 inches ( 95 mm ) longer and 1.6 inches ( 40 mm ) wider . The increased vehicle volume above all creates more spaciousness for the driver and front passenger . There is more shoulder room , elbow room and headroom in all seats . <p> The 2017 Mercedes-Benz C300 Coupe comes equipped with a powerful and efficient 2.0L , four-cylinder gas engine that delivers 241HP and 273 lb-ft of torque .

If you still have the problem , locate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> If you can rotate the engine , you could have a starter problem .

@@10153770 @3353770/ <h> Review : Sunset Overdrive ( Xbox One ) <p> Sunset Overdrive is the latest game from Insomniac Studios , the group that brought the world Ratchet and Clank . Much like those classic games , Sunset Overdrive is full of exciting and over-the-top action , massive and interesting weapons , strange humor and odd characters . The real question is does this new exclusive for the Xbox One simply retread old ground , or has Insomniac managed to create a game that is unique and fun its own right ? <p> From the moment you turn Sunset Overdrive on , the roots of the studio that created it are apparent . Your character is a complete smart ass , and there are giant , awkward mutants that are goosing orange goop and exploding everywhere . In a fun change of pace from games of the modern era , your character is completely customizable . You can choose gender , lots of wild hairstyles , facial hair , clothes , tattoos and more . And then you get to the weapons . The first weapon you get handed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ game is a gun that is shaped like a dick , and it shoots flames . They call it the Flaming Compensator . <p> The premise of the game is simple . A giant corporation is having a huge party to celebrate the launch of its new energy drink , Overcharge . This party is the first and only place to try out the new beverage , and there are lots of people giving it a try . Unfortunately , the drink is contaminated and everyone who drinks it turns into a creepy , oozing mutant that is addicted to the orange liquid . Now you just need to survive . That 's it . It is you and a few other survivors against a horde of Overdrive Drinkers ; shortened to OD for ease of reference . There are a few random collections of rogue human bandits and such , but there is little else to the game on the surface . <p> Despite its shallow covering , there 's a lot to love . If there is anything Sunset Overdrive was created to do , its to beat you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actually frustrated me . The game starts by throwing strange weapons at you like a gun that shoots vinyl records , then it immediately tries to force you to use an odd form of world traversal that feels like it was pulled straight from a Tony Hawk game . Everywhere you go , the game wants you to grind rails , wall-run , bounce off parked cars and more . It was disorienting and gave the start of the game a massive learning curve . <p> But then everything clicks . <p> About an hour into the game I started to get the groove of the motion , the guns , the various enemies and how best to hurt them and more . The guns became more exciting , the movement became more fun and fluid , and I changed from a bumbling idiot with exploding teddy bears into a sliding , grinding killing machine of carnage . <p> Holy shit was it awesome . <p> That single thought drove my every experience in the game . Every gun you get , every boss you fight , every crazy stunt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me stop and giggle . Even the other NPCs you encounter in the game are great . There is a troop of samurai warrior boy scouts , a wild and seemingly eternally stoned mad scientist , and angry old father figure , a gun-toting crazy redneck who tries to make reality television and more . Each one is given an over-the-top personality and equally outlandish script that could have easily made the game terrible , but Insomniac was able to walk that fine line to keep them entertaining and never annoying . <p> I already mentioned that the game is focused purely on fun over any other experience , and this can be best exemplified in some of the climbing missions . In Overdrive , you can leap from ANY height in the game and land without dying . This gives you the freedom to explore the traversal system without fear of accidentally ruining your progress with a death . That said , if your mission is to climb to the top of a very tall building and you fall off 3 floors from the top , suddenly you are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from . It 's a brilliant use of a checkpoint mechanic . <p> Sunset Overdrive offers a lot to players , and only asks for a little in return . If you can make it past the goofy characters , and steep beginning learning curve , you are in for one hell of a fun ride that will very likely exceed any expectation you had going in . <h> About the author : Christian Moe <p> Christian is the Technology and Gaming guru of Guys Gab , and he also happens to be damn great with auto coverage as well .
