Those in the second flowed elegantly together . The living room , which spanned the lakefront fa+ade , was surrounded on two sides by a porch and veranda . In a gesture reminiscent of his earlier Romeo and Juliet tower , Wright designed an angular stairwell tower that projected sharply from beside the main entrance . Although Wright 's second plan was realized , Wallis sold the property immediately after its completion . The subsequent owner drastically modified the home .

In fact , the tall wall of Roman brick that surrounds the terrace at its front conceals the structure 's basement , which Wright raised to ground level . In addition to artfully concealing the true two-story elevation , the wall gives the impression of privacy and impenetrability . This is enhanced by the fact that the front door is positioned out of view , only accessed indirectly by passing beyond the entire front fa+ade and around the side of the house .

Several broad stairs led from the entrance to an elevated living room where built-in cabinetry and wood molding articulated the geometric volumes found on the interior . The upper story of the residence included four bedrooms , while balconies surmounted the first floor entrance and kitchen .

The comprehensive plan included civic buildings such as a church , hotel , railroad station , opera house , and library , as well as private residential structures . However , only the Bitter Root Inn was ultimately realized . The two-story hotel had an office , dining room , reception area , and eighteen modest bedrooms with a communal bathroom . A broad veranda ; low , hipped roofs ; bands of ribbon windows ; and board-and-batten siding gave the structure a patently horizontal appearance .

Although it has been painted and altered in recent years , the house retains many of the characteristics that are shared by other of Wright 's nearby cottages , including board and batten siding , hipped roofs , and ribbon windows situated just below widely projecting soffits . The house is cruciform in plan and , rather than simply expanding the openings between the house 's rooms to create a sense of free-flowing space " as he did in his Shingle style designs " Wright began to eliminate traditional room divisions by breaking down the box-like contours of house 's interior spaces . The dining and living rooms , for instance , penetrate one another on an angle , creating a dynamic relationship and oblique views that anticipate the complex spatial arrangements found in Wright 's Ward Willits house and other of his more advanced prairie-style designs .

@@47318578 @818578/ <h> Four Houses for Robert Roloson <p> Robert Roloson commissioned Wright to remodel a group of four preexisting row houses in 1894 . Concerned with ventilation , Wright devised a plan that incorporated a succession of courts and wells in order to allow light and air into the buildings ' interior rooms . A series of four high-pitched gables dominates the front facade of the row houses . Wright proposed eliminating these design elements , but the client rejected the idea . Their strict geometry is echoed in the rigid sequence of Sullivanesque spandrels and thickly mullioned windows below . The interiors of the houses , which were gutted after a fire and general deterioration in 1981 , also featured Sullivanesque ornament , as did the bulbous balustrades that once encircled the terraces at the front of the houses . Similar balustrades remain intact at Wright 's Nathan G. Moore residence in Oak Park .

Block-like piers connected by wrought iron fencing and topped with gaslight lanterns mark the entrance to Waller 's former estate .

The project entailed the creation of both residential and public structures in a cohesive design vocabulary . Wright conceived of an ambitious plan for the growing community , involving the creation of a town hall , art gallery , residences , and urban infrastructure . The Chicago and Milwaukee Electric Railway Station , a stop along the newly created train line that connected downtown Chicago to the city 's northern suburbs and the city of Milwaukee , was among a handful of projects that were ultimately realized . The structure was small and simple . It featured a flat , cantilevered roof that extended beyond its supporting walls to shelter a train platform . An enclosed , heated room protected travelers from inclement weather . The structure was demolished after the railway was discontinued in the mid-1950s .

Fourteen years later , Blossom commissioned Wright to design a garage on the same property . Wright employed his mature design vocabulary to the garage , which featured a hipped roof , casement windows , and siding in Roman brick , stucco , and wood . He developed two schemes " one outfit to accommodate horses and a carriage , and one designed for automobiles . Both designs provided for a second-story chauffer 's apartment . Ultimately , the latter was realized .

William Copeland , a physician and manufacturer of patent medicines , commissioned Wright to remodel the garage in 1908 , and house in 1909 . Wright proposed a number of renovations aimed at opening the interior spaces to more natural light and giving both structures a simplified , horizontal appearance . Wright eliminated decorative elements from the house 's fa+ade and enlarged its eaves . On the interior , he introduced dark wood stringcourses , which make the tall-ceilinged rooms appear lower . The stringcourses form uninterrupted horizontal bands that create a sense of continuity and free-flowing space between rooms . Wright designed furniture and a built-in sideboard for the dining room , and renovated the fireplace in the reception room . He replaced the steeply pitched roof of the detached garage with a lower , hipped roof more characteristic of those found on his Prairie-style designs .

By the time Wright was commissioned to remodel the company 's brick storefront in 1907 , its inventory had expanded to include textiles , furniture , flooring , lighting fixtures , and other home furnishings . Wright introduced a large plate-glass window for display , and framed it with a long band of casement windows on top and narrow panes of glass on either side . The windows that dominated the storefront 's fa+ade evoked the architecture Wright encountered on his travels in Japan in 1905 . Wright designed cabinetry for storage and the presentation of home furnishings in the shop 's interior . He employed natural oak , oiled paper , and other finishes that evoked Japanese materials and designs . <p> Frank Pebbles Jr. , an executive at Pebbles and Balch , was a friend of the Wright family . Wright eventually designed a house in Oak Park for Oscar Balch , Pebbles ' business partner . 
@@47318669 @818669/ 95867 @qwx505867 <h> Explore <h> Frank Lloyd Wright and the Origins of the House as a Work of Art <p> The balance of power between artists and architects shifted in the last decades of the nineteenth century . As artists became celebrities , the ' artist architect ' emerged - liberated from social conventions and free to pursue a vision of the house as a complex work of art . Frank Lloyd Wright , who embarked on his career in the waning years of the nineteenth century , embodied the concept of the artist architect . Wright 's ideology , like that of his international contemporaries , focused on the complete integration of the house - site and structure , interior and exterior , furniture , ornament and architecture , every element of the design was connected . Dr. Wendy Hitchmough traces the European roots of Wright 's most ambitious early houses .

Unlike many of Wright 's buildings from this period , in which entrances are often indirectly accessed , the entrance to the Hoyt house is conspicuously placed at the center of the front elevation . The entrance opens directly into the living room rather than a hall . The unconventional entryway and frank symmetry that governs the design may indicate that one of Wright 's junior staff was involved in its conception .

Sullivan . Wright conceived of the structure 's design while Sullivan prepared working drawings and oversaw its construction . The long , low-lying structure featured dark-stained board and batten siding and rough fieldstone that complemented the rocky mountain range in the surrounding landscape . It featured an expansive common room with exposed steel trusses and bordered by three fireplaces that evoked Wright 's 1906 River Forest Tennis Club . The fireplaces were surrounded in the same large , irregular fieldstones found on the structure 's exterior . The building terminated with a women 's retiring room on one end , and a men 's on the other . Windows with a chevron pattern illuminated the building 's interior and afforded views onto the athletic fields that surrounded the pavilion
