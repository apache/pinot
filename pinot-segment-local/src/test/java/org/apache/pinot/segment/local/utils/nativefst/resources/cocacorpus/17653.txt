@@77511621 @6211621/ <h> Quiz 26449 @qwx646449 <p> Circular orbits are the simplest kinds of orbits in celestial mechanics , where an orbiting body remains at constant radius as it travels around a gravitating mass . In reality , no orbits of astronomical bodies are perfectly circular , since every object is constantly perturbed by the gravity of a very large number of other nearby objects like the planets in the solar system . However , when a small object like a satellite , asteroid , or small moon orbits a large object like a planet or star , it is a good approximation to treat the system as a two-body system with the larger body fixed .

Recall that the kinetic energy in one dimension was defined as : <p> K = frac12 mv2 . <p> This formula holds for translational motion of a mass ( m ) at velocity ( v ) . For more complicated motion such as rotation , there are additional contributions to the energy of motion ( e.g. the rotational kinetic energy ) . In this article , some cases of computing the kinetic energy of an object given that the sum of all forms of energy is conserved . <h> Contents <h> Work and Energy in One Dimension <p> Kinetic energy is the energy possessed by an object in motion . It is a scalar quantity , meaning it only possesses a magnitude . It is typically measured in Joules ( J ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , since doing work on objects can increase or decrease their energy .

This is a consequence of the conservation of energy ; in order to do work on an object , some amount of energy must be expended . In order to conserve energy , the expended energy is made up in the additional kinetic energy of the object . <p> For some forces , like friction , the work done by the force actually removes kinetic energy from an object .

The formal reason for this is that in walking , people do work against gravity in lifting their feet ( or work to overcome friction by dragging their feet ) . So when walking , people constantly exert force in the direction of their movement to keep them moving , i.e. they do work . People who travel further will do more work since they will be exerting this force over a larger amount of distance . This distance may be less than the actual distance walked , but it is a safe assumption that it is roughly proportional to distance traveled .

Since ( g(x) ) divides ( f(x) ) over the complex numbers , and both polynomials are real , ( g(x) ) must divide ( f(x) ) over the real numbers .

@@77511634 @6211634/ <h> Partition of an Integer 26449 @qwx646449 <p> A partition of a positive integer ( n ) is an expression of ( n ) as the sum of one or more positive integers ( or parts ) . The order of the integers in the sum " does not matter " : that is , two expressions that contain the same integers in a different order are considered to be the same partition . <p> The number of different partitions of ( n ) is denoted ( p(n) ) .

Solving this recursion is not hard : note that ( c(n+1) = c(n)+c(n-1)+cdots+c(1)+1 = c(n)+c(n) = 2c(n) ) , and ( c(1)=1 ) , so ( c(n) = 2n-1 ) .

Here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : <h> Conjugate partitions <p> One concept that is most easily understood from diagrams of partitions is the notion of conjugacy . <p> Let ( pi ) be a partition of ( n ) , and let ( ak ) be the number of parts of ( pi ) that are ( ge k ) . Suppose the largest part is ( d ) . Then the conjugate of ( pi ) is the partition n = a1 + a2 + ldots + ad . <p> There is something to prove in the definition , namely that the sum of the ( ai ) actually equals ( n ) . To see this , note that a part of size ( b ) is counted once in ( a1 , a2 , ldots , ab ) . So a part of size ( b ) contributes ( b ) to the sum , so the sum is the same as the sum of the parts of ( pi ) . <p> This is not the easiest way to think about conjugate partitions . They are most simply described in terms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ partition is obtained from the Ferrers diagram of the original partition via reflection along the top-left to bottom-right diagonal . The operation is similar to a matrix transpose ; the columns of the diagram change to rows and the rows change to columns . <p> Note that the description via Ferrers diagrams shows without any work that conjugating twice returns the original partition , which was not necessarily immediately clear from the definition of conjugation . <p> Conjugate partitions are used in many bijective proofs of results about partitions ; here is one basic example . <p> Solution : Let ( S ( n , k ) ) be the set of partitions of ( n ) into ( k ) parts and let ( T ( n , k ) ) be the set of partitions of ( n ) whose largest part equals ( k ) . Then there is a bijection ( fcolon S ( n , k ) to T ( n , k ) ) defined by ( f(pi) = ) the conjugate of ( pi ) . This is because the Ferrers diagram of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) has a first column of length ( k ) , so its conjugate has top row of length ( k ) . And ( f ) is a bijection because it has an inverse map , namely conjugation . So the two sets have the same size . ( square ) <h> Generating functions <p> Many theorems about partitions that have complicated combinatorial proofs are easier and more accessible via generating functions . It is often the case that formal power series of the form ( sum an xn ) , where the ( an ) count certain types of partitions , can be expressed as infinite products in useful ways . <p> Express ( displaystyle sumn=0infty p(n) xn ) as an infinite product of power series . <p> Solution : Consider the product LONG ... The coefficient of ( xn ) in this expansion is ( p(n) ) : suppose a partition of ( n ) has ( a1 ) 1s , ( a2 ) 2s , and so on . Then ( n = a1+2a2+cdots+nan ) , and this corresponds to the term in the expansion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first sum , times ( x2a2 ) from the second sum , and so on . <p> The theorem can be proved using partitions as well : the coefficient of ( xk ) in the product counts the number of partitions of ( k ) with an even number of parts minus the partitions of ( k ) with an odd number of parts . It can be shown ( using Ferrers diagrams ) that there is a bijection between these two sets of partitions , unless ( k ) is a pentagonal number , in which case there is a bijection between the sets with one specific partition removed . <p> Let the partition function ( P(n) ) enumerate the ways ( n ) can be expressed as a distinct sum of positive integers , eg ( P(4) = 5 ) since ( 4 = 3+1 = 2+2 = 2+1+1 = 1+1+1+1 ) are the only ways to represent ( 4 ) . <p> Euler 's pentagonal number theorem implies the following beautiful recurrence relation for ( p(n) ) : p(n) = **40;148;TOOLONG where the sign of ( p(n-k) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) in the sum expansion in Euler 's pentagonal number theorem .

There are several varieties of the game , but they all tend to have these aspects in common : The game begins with each player putting down money allocated for betting . During each round of play , players are dealt cards from a standard 52-card deck , and the goal of each player is to have the best 5-card hand at the table . Players keep their cards hidden , and each player makes bets on the strength of his or her cards . When the round is over , the cards are revealed , and the player with the best hand wins the round and the money that was bet during that round . The game is over when a single player has won all the money at the table . <p> Although poker contains elements of randomness and gambling , there is a substantial amount of skill involved in understanding probability and game theory . Poker strategy typically involves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of winning . Over the long run of rounds and games , higher skilled players tend to win more . <p> It should be noted that one does not need to be interested in poker strategy to be interested in the mathematics involved in poker . There are many interesting mathematical observations to be made about a deck of cards and probabilities of events in poker . This page will explore these mathematical observations . <p> One aspect of the strategy of poker is to think about what cards you would need in order to win the game . If you know the probability that you will get a card that you need , then you will have a good understanding of what your chances are of winning . <p> You are playing a game of poker , and you have just been dealt the following hand of cards : <p> 3G , 6G , 7G , textJG , 5colorredG <p> You put the ( 5colorredG ) aside and ask to be dealt a new card . What is the probability that the next card dealt to you is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 52 cards . With the five cards dealt to you , there are now 9 spades left in a deck of 47 cards . <p> Let ( D ) be the event that a spade is drawn . By probability by outcomes , <p> P(D)=frac947 <p> The probability that the next card dealt to you is a spade is ( boxeddfrac947 ) . <p> There are 52 cards in a poker deck , and a hand is a combination of 5 of those cards . Therefore , the number of possible poker hands is : <p> binom525=2,598,960 <p> Poker hands are put into classifications so that players can know how much their hand is worth . The following is a list of poker hand classifications , listed from the least valuable to the most valuable : <p> High Card : This type of hand is any hand that can not be classified as one of the types below . <p> Example : ( 3G , 8(colorredG) , 9G , 10G , QG ) <p> One Pair : This type of hand consists of 2 cards of the same rank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a Kind : This type of hand consists of 3 cards of a the same rank , and 2 other cards of distinct ranks . <p> Example : ( QG , Q(colorredG) , QG , KG , 4G ) <p> Straight : This type of hand consists of 5 consecutive cards by value . The face cards are valued above the numbered cards in the order , J , Q , K. The Ace card can represent the lowest valued card or the highest valued card , but it can not represent both . <p> Royal Flush : A royal flush is the highest possible straight flush . It consists of cards of the ranks 10 , J , Q , K , and A that are all of the same suit . <p> Example : ( 10G , JG , QG , KG , AG ) <p> These classifications are mutually exclusive and exhaustive . If a hand meets the criteria for two classifications , then it is always classified as the higher of those classifications . For example , the hand ( 7(colorredG) , 7(colorredG) , 7G @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a full house ; it would never be classified as three of a kind or one pair . <h> Probabilities of Poker Hands <p> Each of the 2,598,960 possible hands of poker is equally likely when dealt 5 cards from a standard poker deck . Because of this , one can use probability by outcomes to compute the probabilities of each classification of poker hand . <p> The binomial coefficient can be used to calculate certain combinations of cards . Then , the counting principles of rule of sum and rule of product can be used to compute the frequency of each poker hand classification . Then , the probability of each poker hand classification is simply its frequency divided by 2,598,960 . <p> The probabilities calculated below are based on drawing 5 cards from a shuffled poker deck . The likelihood of each type of hand determines its value . The less likely the hand , the more it is worth . For example , a flush is always better than a straight because a flush is less likely than a straight when drawing 5 cards from a shuffled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rules on drawing cards , these rankings are always used to determine the best hand . The hand classifications below are ordered from least value ( most likely ) to most value ( least likely ) . <p> It is recommended that you try to compute these probabilities on your own before looking at the computations shown here . These classifications are ordered by their relative frequencies , but it is not recommended that you start with the High Card Hand computation , as it is more complicated than other computations . There is more than one way to arrive at the correct answer , so do not despair if your methodology is not the exact same . <p> It is necessary to select ranks in such a way that no multiples of the same rank occurs , but it 's also necessary to ensure that the hand is not a straight or a flush . <p> First , determine the combinations of 5 distinct ranks out of the 13. 10 of these combinations form a straight , so subtract those combinations . Then , select a suit for each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( binom415 ) ways , but 4 of those ways give a flush , so subtract those ways .

Then , select 2 suits out of the 4 for the pair . Then , select 3 distinct ranks from the remaining 12 . Then , select a suit for each of those cards .

This is called a buy-in . The buy-ins are a prize given to the winner . The purpose of buy-ins is to ensure that each player has a stake in playing well and winning the game . <p> Betting chips are used to represent money while playing . Sometimes , players are allowed to put down more money in the middle of a game , but players are typically not allowed to " cash out " their chips until the game is over . <p> Dealing <p> Each round of poker has a dealer . This person is responsible for shuffling the deck and dealing the cards to each player . Sometimes , a non-player is given dealer responsibilities for the entire game . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A dealer chip is used to designate who is the dealer each round , and that chip is passed on to a new player after each round . Even if the dealer is a not a player , this chip is still passed around , because certain betting rules depend of the location of the dealer at the table . <p> Betting <p> The pot : The total amount of money bet by players each round is called the pot . The winner of each round takes the entire contents of the pot for that round . If there is a draw after a round , then the pot is shared among those players in a draw . <p> Ante : Many variations of poker require each player to bet a certain amount before each round begins . This is called an ante bet . The ante happens before players see their cards . The purpose of this rule is to prevent games from going on too long , and to keep each player somewhat invested in each round . <p> Blinds : Some variations of poker require blind bets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be in addition to the ante . Like an ante , they happen before each player is dealt their cards . Unlike an ante , only some of the players are required to make a blind bet . This requirement is rotated around the table each round so that each player takes turns making the blind bet . <p> Betting : The main betting phase typically begins after players have been dealt their cards . Betting begins with a different player depending on the variant of poker . Each player takes a turn betting , and these turns are taken clockwise around the table . There are a number of options each time a player takes his or her turn betting : <p> Check : If no money was raised since the player 's last turn , that player can check and pass to the next player . If the round has a blind bet , then each player must call the blind bet before they can check . <p> Call : If money was raised since the player 's last turn , that player can call and bet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ current bet and the amount that the player last bet . <p> Raise : A player can raise the amount of the bet by betting more money than the current bet . <p> Fold : A player can refuse to bet . This is called a fold , and that player is effectively out of the round . A player that folds gives up all money that he or she bet that round . It may seem wasteful to fold , but this is often the best strategy when a player knows that he or she is not likely to win the round . <p> All-in : In certain situations , a player will put all of his or her remaining chips into the pot . This is called an all-in . There are special rules for how this type of bet works , depending on the variant of poker . <p> The round of betting is over once each player at the table has either called , checked , folded , or made an all-in bet . <p> Winning a round <p> For each round , there is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ betting phase . Only the players who have not folded have a chance to win the round . Players take turns clockwise around the table revealing their hands . The player that begins this process depends on the variant of poker . A player may choose not to reveal his or her hand , but a player who makes this choice can not win the round . <p> The player that wins the round is the player with the best 5-card hand . This player wins all the money in the pot . Sometimes , there is a tie among the best 5-card hands . In this case , the round ends in a draw , and the pot is shared among the players with those hands . <p> Winning the game <p> Over the course of many rounds , players will run out of money and drop out of the game . The game is over when one player has won all the money that was put down as buy-in at the table . <p> Even though the winner has won all of the chips at the table , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after the game is over . It can be agreed before the game starts that the last remaining players will share the money in some way . This ensures that the game is not all-or-nothing ; players can win some amount of money if they play well , even if they do n't win the game . <h> Variants of Poker <p> It 's important to know the rules of a poker game to be able to calculate probabilities in poker . There are many variants of poker ; the following are a couple of the most common . <p> Five-Card Draw <p> This is regarded as the simplest version of poker to learn . <p> For each round , ante and/or blind bets are made . After the ante and blinds , each player is dealt a hand of 5 cards . Players look at their cards , and keep them hidden from other players . The first betting phase begins after each player has seen his or her cards . Betting typically begins with the player to the left of the dealer or to the left of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the round is called the draw phase . During this phase , players can choose to discard cards from his or her hand and request to be dealt that many cards . Players will typically use this phase to improve their hands to more valuable hands . In some versions of five-card draw , there is a limit on how many cards can be discarded and replaced . However , most of the time , there is no limit on the number of cards that can be discarded and replaced . A player could discard his or her whole hand for a new hand if that player wished . <p> After the draw phase , the final betting phase begins . Afterwards , players take turns revealing their cards . Whoever has the best hand wins the pot . <p> Then , a new round with antes and blinds begins . <p> Seven-Card Stud <p> This variant of poker is a stud , meaning that each player has some cards that are revealed to all players at the table . Each player is dealt a total of 7 cards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 5-card hand out of those cards . Other than the first 3 cards , players are dealt cards one at a time , with a betting round between each newly dealt card . <p> For each round , ante and/or blind bets are made . After the ante and blinds , players are dealt 2 cards face-down ( hidden from other players ) and 1 card face-up ( revealed to other players ) . The first round of betting begins either with the player who has the best face-up card , or with the player to the left of the player who blind bet . <p> After the first betting phase , each player is dealt a card face-up . Then , another betting phase begins with the player who has the best face-up cards . <p> After the second betting phase , each player is dealt a card face-up . Then , another betting phase begins with the player who has the best face-up cards . <p> After the third betting phase , each player is dealt a card face-up . Then , another betting phase begins with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fourth betting phase , each player is dealt a card face-down . Then , the final betting phase begins with the player who has the best face-up cards . <p> After the final betting phase , players make the best 5-card hand out of their 7 cards . Players take turns revealing their cards , and the player with the best hand wins the pot . <p> This is now the most popular variant of poker . It is a variant of community card poker : In this kind of poker , some cards are revealed to the whole table , and each player can use those cards to build his or her 5-card hand . <p> A round begins with blind bets , and sometimes ante bets . Texas Hold-em typically has a " big blind " and a " small blind . " The big blind is an amount twice as much as the small blind . The player to the left of the dealer makes the small blind bet , and the next player to the left makes the big blind bet . <p> After these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hidden from other players ) . This phase is called the pre-flop , and each player 's hidden cards are called that player 's hole or pocket . The first phase of betting begins with the player to the left of the big blind . <p> After the pre-flop betting phase , 3 cards are dealt face-up ( revealed to all players ) at the center of the table . These 3 cards are called the flop . They are community cards , meaning that each player uses them to build his or her 5-card hand . After the flop is dealt , another betting phase begins with the player to the left of the dealer . <p> After the flop betting phase , another community card is dealt face-up next to the flop . This card is called the turn . After the the turn is dealt , another betting phase begins with the player to the left of the dealer . <p> After the turn betting phase , another community card is dealt face-up next to the others . This card is called the river . After the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the player to the left of the dealer . <p> Each player still in the round reveals their hands simultaneously . Each player makes the best possible 5-card hand available from his or her pocket cards and the community cards . Because Texas Hold-Em uses community cards , ties are more common than with other variants , and special rules designate how to break ties based on the specific cards contained in each player 's hand . Even so , draws are still possible , and the pot is shared if this is the case . Otherwise , the player with the best 5-card hand wins the pot .

@@77511638 @6211638/ 26449 @qwx646449 <p> The Prime Number Theorem describes the asymptotic distribution of prime numbers . It gives us a general view of how primes are distributed amongst positive integers and also states that the primes become less common as they become larger . Informally , the theorem states that if any random positive integer is selected in the range of zero to a large number ( N ) , the probability that the selected integer is a prime is about ( dfrac1ln N ) where ( ln N ) is the natural logarithm of ( N ) . <p> One application of the theorem is that it gives a sense of how long it will take to find a prime of a certain size by a random search . Many cryptosystems ( e.g. RSA ) require primes ( p approx 2512 ) ; the theorem says that the probability that a randomly chosen number of that size is prime is roughly ( 1/ln(2512) approx 1/355 ) , or ( 1/177 ) if the search is restricted to odd numbers .

The stationary distribution gives information about the stability of a random process and , in certain cases , describes the limiting behavior of the Markov chain . <p> Taken from the UMich website <p> A sports broadcaster wishes to predict how many Michigan residents prefer University of Michigan teams ( known more succinctly as " Michigan " ) and how many prefer Michigan State teams . She noticed that , year after year , most people stick with their preferred team ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Michigan State , and about ( 5% ) of Michigan State fans switch to Michigan . However , there is no noticeable difference in the state 's population of 10 million 's preference at large ; in other words , it seems Michigan sports fans have reached a stationary distribution . What might that be ? <p> A reasonable way to approach this problem is to suppose there are ( x ) million Michigan fans and ( y ) million Michigan State fans . The state 's population is ( 10 ) million , so ( x + y = 10 ) . These numbers do not change each year . It follows that beginalign* x &amp;= 0.97x + 0.05y y &amp;= 0.03x + 0.95y. endalign* Rearranging either equation , ( x = tfrac53 y ) .

In other words , the transposed transition matrix ( textbfPT ) has eigenvectors with eigenvalue ( 1 ) that are stationary distributions expressed as column vectors . Therefore , if the eigenvectors of ( textbfPT ) are known , then so are the stationary distributions of the Markov chain with transition matrix ( textbfP ) . <p> When there are multiple eigenvectors associated to an eigenvalue of 1 , each such eigenvector gives rise to an associated stationary distribution .

@@77511644 @6211644/ <h> Quiz 26449 @qwx646449 <p> Waves are oscillatory disturbances in physical quantities , like light waves , sound waves , or transverse oscillations of a string . These disturbances take energy to create and propagate , in order to move the constituent particles or change the electric/magnetic fields . The power of a wave is therefore energy transported per unit time by the oscillations of a particular wave . The derivation of a formula for the power depends on the medium -- for light waves , the power is measured by the poynting vector , whereas for oscillations on a string , the power can be computed directly by balancing forces using Newton 's second law . However , for all types of waves , the formula and physical meaning of the power takes similar forms , typically depending on the square amplitude of the waves among other factors . <p> From considering the forces acting on a small element of the string , one can find the power carried by that element and from there the power carried by the oscillations throughout the string . See below diagram @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accelerated by tension forces due to the displacements of nearby parts of the string . <p> The power carried by a particle simply obeys the formula ( P = vecF cdot vecv ) . Since the force acting on a small part of the string is just the tension ( T ) due to a nearby piece of the string , this power is : <p> P = Tv cos ( 90 - theta ) = Tv sin theta , <p> where ( theta ) is the angle between the tension force and the horizontal as in the above diagram . For small oscillations that satisfy the wave equation , ( sin theta approx theta approx tan theta ) by the small-angle approximation . So the power can be rewritten in terms of the displacement ( y ) of the small piece of string as : <p> since the average of cosine squared over an oscillation is ( frac12 ) . <p> This formula can also be written with different variables , using the fact that wave velocity is given in terms of mass density ( mu ) and tension @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that by definition ( k = fracomegav ) .

Note that the energy transmitted by the wave depends on the source of the waves . The source determines the amplitude of the wave as the source oscillates . The frequency , i.e. , how rapid the oscillations are transmitted , also depends on the source . The mass density of the string determines the amount of inertia of the string ; a heavier string oscillating at a particular frequency carries more energy because it takes more energy to move something with more inertia .

@@77511657 @6211657/ 26449 @qwx646449 <p> The moment of inertia is a physical quantity which tells how easily a body can be rotated about a given axis . It is a rotational analogue of mass . It plays the same role in rotational motion as inertia ' does in translational motion . Inertia is the property of matter which resists change in its state of motion . Inertia is a measure of the force that keeps a stationary object stationary , or a moving object moving at its current speed . The larger the inertia , the greater the force that is required to bring some change in its velocity in a given amount of time . Suppose a heavy truck and a light car are both at rest , then intuitively we know that more force will be required to push the truck to a certain speed in a given amount of time than will be needed to push the car to that same speed in the same amount of time .. <p> Similarly , moment of inertia is that property where matter resists change in its state of rotatory motion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the amount of torque that will be required to bring the same change in its angular velocity in a given amount of time . <p> Unlike inertia , moment of inertia depends not only on the mass but also the distribution of mass around the axis about which the moment of inertia is to be calculated . An object can have different moments of inertia about different axes . That is , to rotate an object about different axes with an equal angular acceleration , different torque ( or effort ) is required . <h> Moment of inertia , how intuitive is it ? <p> Moment of inertia shows the tendency of an object to stay in its state of rotatory motion . If an object has more mass , then it is more difficult to rotate it . Consider two spheres of the same radius : one made up of wood , and the other of iron . Both are at the same distance from the axis of rotation . <p> Which one is easier to rotate ? The one which is made up of wood will be easier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ requires more efforts for larger mass to set up into the rotation . Thus , moment of inertia depends upon mass . <p> Consider the two identical objects of the same mass at different distances from the axis of rotation . <p> Two identical objects at different distance from axis of rotation <p> It is not equally easy to rotate both of them about the same axis of rotation . More efforts are required for the object at a greater distance to accelerate to the same angular velocity . Thus , it can be calculated that moment of inertia is dependent on the distance from the axis . If the mass is farther away from the axis , its moment of inertia is greater . <p> Consider a cricket bat as shown in the diagram below . There are two axes about which the bat can be rotated . About which axis is it easier to rotate ? Do we require the same or different amount of torque to produce the same angular acceleration about the two axes ? If different , then about which axis is less torque required @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easier to rotate about axis 2 . As the mass moves away from the axis , it becomes more difficult to rotate . Thus , the bat has a different moment of inertia about the axes . The moment of inertia of the bat is less about axis 2 compared to that about axis 1 . Therefore , we can say that as the mass moves away from the axis , its moment of inertia increases and it becomes more difficult to rotate . <p> A metal ring is melted and a solid sphere is made out of it . What happens to the moment of inertia about the vertical axis through the center ? <p> Not enough information Moment of inertia remains the same as the total mass remains the same Moment of inertia increases Moment of inertia decreases due to the decrease in the distance of the redistributed mass <h> General Properties and Ideas <p> Moment of inertia is a tensor quantity . It has different values for different axes . <p> It depends upon the mass as well as the mass 's distribution around its axis . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different axes . <p> It is an inherent property of matter by which it tries to maintain its state of angular motion unless and until it is compelled by external torques . <p> It is an extensive ( additive ) property : the moment of inertia of a composite system is the sum of the moments of inertia of its components ' subsystems ( all taken about the same axis ) . <h> Point Mass <p> The moment of inertia of a point mass ( m ) about an axis at a perpendicular distance of ( r ) from it is given by ( mr2 ) . <p> Therefore if the distance of a point mass from the axis is doubled , then the moment of inertia will be quadrupled . If the mass is doubled , then the moment of inertia will also be doubled . <h> Moment of Inertia of Mass Distributions <p> The moment of inertia of an ( n ) -point mass system ( mi i=1n ) at perpendicular distances ( ri i=1n ) from the axis of rotation is given by ( displaystyle sumi=1n mi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ masses adds up just as a scalar quantity would . <p> Avoid this pitfall : It should also be noted that the moment of inertia of a system of particles about an axis is not the same as the moment of inertia of the center of mass of the system of particles about the same axis . <h> Find the moment of inertia of a point mass system consisting of six equal masses , each of mass ( m ) placed at the corners of a regular hexagon of side length ( a ) about an axis passing through the center of the hexagon and perpendicular to its plane . Find the moment of inertia of mass of ( 6m ) placed at the center of mass of the above system . <p> According to the formula , the moment of inertia is ( displaystyle I = sumi=16 mi ri2 ) .

Thus , ( ri = a ) for ( i = 1,2,3,4,5,6 ) . Therefore , I = sumi=16 m a2 = 6ma2 . <p> Moment of inertia of continuous mass distribution : A continuous mass system can be thought of as a collection of infinite mass particles . A bigger object can be broken down into infinitely small elemental point masses . The total moment of inertia will be the sum of all these particles . An integration helps to add the moments of inertia of all these particles . <p> Thus , the moment of inertia of a distributed mass system can be written as I = int dm , r2 , where ( I ) is the moment of inertia , ( dm ) is the mass of a small element considered on the object , and ( r ) is the distance of the elemental mass from the axis . <p> Calculate the moment of inertia of a uniform straight rod of mass ( M ) and length ( L ) about an axis passing through one of its ends . <p> Consider an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having a length of ( dx ) from the axis .

We then can simply integrate this as follows : <p> As we now know , a body can have different moments of inertia about different axes . Then , is there any relation among these moments of inertia ? Yes , the moments of inertia about a few axes can be found using two theorems : <p> perpendicular axis theorem <p> parallel axis theorem . <h> Relation of Moment of Inertia with Kinetic Energy of the System <p> For the particle of mass ( mi ) at a distance ( ri ) from the axis , the linear velocity is ( vi=riomega ) .

For objects like spheres , cylinders , cones , etc. , this theorem can not be applied . <p> Consider a lamina lying in the ( xy ) -plane . The ( z ) -axis passes through the intersection of the ( x ) - and ( y ) -axes and is perpendicular to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point on the lamina of mass ( dm ) at coordinate ( ( x , y , z ) , ) then the moment of inertia about the ( x ) -axis can be calculated as Ix = int dm , y2. qquad ( 1 ) Similarly , Iy = int dm , x2. qquad ( 2 ) For the moment of inertia about the ( z ) -axis , let the distance from the ( z ) -axis be ( r = sqrt x2 + y2 , ) then Iz = int dm , r2= int dm , ( x2+y2 ) . qquad ( 3 ) Adding ( ( 1 ) ) and ( ( 2 ) ) and using ( ( 3 ) , ) we get beginalign Ix + Iy &amp;= int dm , x2 + int dm , y2 &amp;= int dm , ( x2 + y2 ) &amp;= Iz. endalign <p> To learn about the second theorem , i.e. parallel axis theorem , we first need to learn about the concept of center of mass . <h> Center of Mass - Acceleration <p> The center @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

It states that for any collection of sets , one can construct a new set containing an element from each set in the original collection . In other words , one can choose an element from each set in the collection . <p> Intuitively , the axiom of choice guarantees the existence of mathematical objects which are obtained by a series of choices , so that it can be viewed as an extension of a finite process ( choosing objects from bins ) to infinite settings . Though this extension seems to be obvious and reasonable , it is also quite powerful ; granting it leads to somewhat unexpected and perhaps unnatural-seeming consequences . <p> Developments in logic in the 20(textth) century established that the axiom of choice was independent of the commonly accepted axioms of set theory due to Zermelo and Fraenkel ; that is , Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory with the axiom of choice ( ZFC ) and Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory without the axiom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Nevertheless , most mathematicians generally accept the axiom of choice as true and use it when necessary . <h> Contents <h> Formal Statement <p> Let ( mathcalI ) be a set . A collection indexed by ( mathcalI ) is a collection of sets ( Siiin mathcalI ) . In other words , the collection contains one set for each element of ( mathcalI ) . <p> A choice function is a function f : mathcalI to bigcupiin mathcalI Si such that ( f(i) in Si ) for all ( i in mathcalI ) . The axiom of choice states that for any indexed collection of nonempty sets , there exists a choice function . <p> Another formulation of the axiom of choice is in terms of the Cartesian product of sets : the axiom of choice is the statement that the Cartesian product of an indexed collection of nonempty sets is nonempty : Si ne emptyset , , forall , , i in mathcalI Rightarrow prodiinmathcalI Si ne emptyset . <p> Note that the axiom of choice is only an interesting statement when the indexing set ( mathcalI @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a finite product of nonempty sets is nonempty without using the axiom of choice , e.g. by induction on the number of sets . While the axiom of choice does seem like a straightforward generalization of this property , it has many surprising consequences , some of which are listed in the next two sections . <h> Well-ordering Theorem and Zorn 's Lemma <p> The axiom of choice was initially introduced by Zermelo in order to prove the following theorem : <p> Well-ordering Theorem <p> Every set can be well-ordered : that is , there is a total order on the set such that every nonempty subset has a least element . <p> This ordering may not be the most obvious order . For instance , the set of real numbers with the usual order is not well-ordered , since many subsets of ( mathbb R ) ( including ( mathbb R ) itself ) do not have a least element . On the other hand , ( mathbb N ) with its usual order is well-ordered ; this is the content of the well-ordering principle . <p> It turns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ axiom of choice--that is , each one implies the other using only ZF set theory . Here is another equivalent statement that is often used in proofs : <p> Zorn 's Lemma <p> Let ( X ) be a partially ordered set with the property that every chain in ( X ) has an upper bound in ( X. ) Then ( X ) contains a maximal element . <p> Recall that a chain is a set of elements of ( X ) which are all comparable to each other , an upper bound of a chain is an element that is comparable to and " greater than " all the elements of the chain , and a maximal element is an element ( xin X ) such that there is no ( y in X ) with ( x prec y . ) <h> Other Equivalent Statements <p> Here is a partial list of other statements from other areas of mathematics which are logically equivalent to the axiom of choice . Note that many of them assert the existence of an object without giving a prescription for its computation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , these nonconstructive existence results are precisely what the axiom of choice is useful for . <p> Every field has an algebraic closure ; that is , if ( k ) is a field , there is an extension ( overlinek ) of ( k ) obtained by adjoining algebraic elements , such that every polynomial with coefficients in ( overlinek ) has a root in ( overlinek . ) <p> The Banach-Tarski paradox : a 3-dimensional ball can be decomposed into finitely many disjoint subsets , which can be reassembled into two copies of the ball . ( ( ) The idea is that although this violates our notions of volume , these notions do not make sense for all subsets of ( mathbb R3 . ) The axiom of choice is required to construct the " non-measurable " subsets in the decomposition . ( ) ) <h> Independence and Controversy <p> A common joke 1 is as follows : " The axiom of choice is obviously true ; the well-ordering theorem is obviously false ; and who can tell about Zorn 's lemma ? " Of course , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point is that some forms of the axiom of choice are more intuitively believable than others . <p> G+del showed that ZFC was logically consistent in 1938 , and Paul Cohen showed that ZF(neg)C was logically consistent in 1962 . The upshot of this work was that there was no way to resolve the question of the truth or falsity of the axiom of choice using the axioms of ZF . The question of whether to assume the axiom of choice or its negation is more or less a question of " taste , " and the consensus of the mathematical community is that the ZFC universe seems more natural than the ZF(neg)C universe . <p> Nevertheless , there are mathematicians who either do not " believe in " the axiom of choice or who are interested in the logical repercussions of disallowing this axiom in their set theory . For instance , some mathematicians identified as " constructivists " believe that mathematical objects only exist if they can be constructed explicitly , so the axiom of choice and its nonconstructive nature are unacceptable . The majority of ( non-logician @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least partly as a matter of convenience ; the theoretical tools that the axiom of choice makes available allow for a richer theory in many contexts where it applies . For instance , knowing that every vector space has a basis can be helpful for proofs and other constructions , even when no explicit basis can be constructed . <p> It is standard for mathematicians to keep track of which results require the axiom of choice and which ones can be proved without it . The rest of the axioms of ZF set theory are essentially universally accepted , so it is helpful to be precise about exactly when the axiom of choice is unavoidable . <h> Selected Proofs <p> Here is a proof that the well-ordering theorem implies the axiom of choice . ( The converse is more involved . ) <p> Let ( Si ) be a collection of nonempty sets indexed by ( mathcalI . ) Then the union of the ( Si ) can be well-ordered by the well-ordering theorem . So every subset of the union has a least element ; so every ( Si @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( f colon mathcalI to cupiinmathcalI Si ) by ( f(i)=mi . ) Then ( f ) is a choice function . ( square ) <p> The point is that the necessary choice is given to us for free by the well-ordering theorem . <p> Here is a typical example of a proof using Zorn 's lemma that every vector space has a basis : <p> Let ( V ) be a vector space and let ( mathcalS ) be the collection of linearly independent subsets of ( V , ) partially ordered by inclusion . Suppose we are given a chain of linearly independent subsets . Then the union of the subsets in the chain is an upper bound , and it is linearly independent : suppose that ( a1v1+cdots+anvn= 0 ) for some ( vi ) in the union and ( ai ) in the field of constants . Since each ( vi ) is in a subset of the chain , there must be some subset in the chain that contains them all . That subset is linearly independent , so all the ( ai ) must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Zorn 's lemma , ( mathcalS ) has a maximal element ; call it ( B. ) Because ( B ) is maximal , this means that ( Bcupv ) is linearly dependent for ( vnotin B. ) The resulting dependence relation can be simplified to give an expression for ( v ) as a linear combination of elements of ( B ) : beginalign av+sumi=1n ai bi &amp;= 0 Rightarrow v &amp;= sumi=1n -fracaia bi. endalign The key is that ( ane 0 ) because otherwise there would be a dependence relation among the ( bi , ) which is impossible because ( B ) is linearly independent . So ( v ) is in the span of ( B , ) and this is true for all ( vnotin B , ) so ( B ) spans ( V. ) So ( B ) is a basis . <p> Again , this is by no means an obvious result .

@@77511660 @6211660/ 26449 @qwx646449 <p> Every calculus student learns that divergent series should not be manipulated in the same way as convergent series . For example , if forced to assign a value to the divergent series 1-1+1-1+1-1+cdots , the most obvious method is to group terms ( 1-1 ) + ( 1-1 ) + ( 1-1 ) +cdots=0+0+0+cdots=0 , but this produces a different answer if the terms are grouped differently : 1+ ( -1+1 ) + ( -1+1 ) + ( -1+1 ) +cdots = 1+0+0+cdots = 1 . Nevertheless , it is often useful to assign values to divergent series in " reasonable " or " consistent " ways . Indeed , mathematicians from Euler to Ramanujan used divergent series to derive many important results ( though with varying degrees of rigorous justification ) . This wiki will discuss <p> ( 1 ) what makes a method of assigning values " reasonable , " ( 2 ) some methods that are commonly used , and ( 3 ) most importantly , why these methods are useful in practice . <p> The goal is to convince readers that Abel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ divergent series are the invention of the devil , and it is a shame to base on them any demonstration whatsoever . " <p> Not every useful method for summing series satisfies these requirements ( in particular stability ) , but many do . Note that most methods for summing series do not work on every series ; the goal is to find and use methods that sum as many interesting and important series as possible . The above requirements alone are often enough to determine what the value of the sum of a given series must be under any method that satisfies the requirements . <p> Find the sum of ( 1-1+1-1+1-1+cdots ) under any summation method that is regular , linear , and stable , assuming the method provides a sum for this series . <p> The answers to both these questions seem quite odd , but notice that they both represent a sort of continuation of a known formula for geometric series : sumn=0infty rn = frac11-r . In calculus one learns that this only converges for ( r in ( -1,1 ) ) . One way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to use this formula but plug in values outside the interval of convergence , namely ( r = -1 ) and ( r=2 ) , respectively . Of course , this is not anywhere near a general summation method , but it does give an intuitive sense of where the answers are coming from . The idea of continuation will arise more formally below . <h> Cesaro Summation <p> As a first example of a summation method , Cesaro summation works as follows : rather than taking the limit of the partial sums , take the limit of their averages . That is , given a series ( sum an ) , let ( sk ) be the ( ktextth ) partial sum as usual , and let tk = frac1k(s1+s2+cdots+sk) , and assign the value ( limlimitsktoinfty tk ) to ( sum an ) , if the limit exists . <p> It can be shown that Cesaro summation is regular , linear , and stable . <p> For the series ( 1-1+1-1+1-1+cdots ) , the partial sums are ( 1,0,1,0,1,0 , ldots ) . The series is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But the sequence of averages of the partial sums is LONG ... which converges to ( frac12 ) . So the series is Cesaro summable , to ( frac12 ) . <p> Cesaro summability allows certain series with oscillatory sequences of partial sums to be " smoothed out , " but if the partial sums of the series go to ( infty ) instead ( e.g. the harmonic series ) , the averages of the partial sums will also go to ( infty ) , so series like ( 1+2+4+8+cdots ) will not be Cesaro summable . <h> Abel Summation <p> Abel summation involves limits of power series : define sumn=0infty an = limzto 1- sumn=0infty anzn if the limit exists . The idea is to extend the conclusion of Abel 's theorem , which says ( in part ) that if ( sum an ) converges , then the limit on the right side of the above equation exists and equals the sum . ( This is precisely the statement that Abel summation is regular . ) Note that the example ( 1-1+1-1+1-1+cdots ) is Abel summable , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the limit is ( limlimitszto 1- frac11+z = frac12 ) . <p> In fact , any series that is Cesaro summable is also Abel summable , and the sums are the same . So Abel summability is stronger ( though Cesaro summability is nevertheless still useful due to its relative ease of computation ) . Here is an example of a series that is Abel summable but not Cesaro summable . <p> The Abel sum of the ( divergent ) series as shown above can be written as ( fracab ) , where ( a ) and ( b ) are coprime positive integers . Find ( a+b ) . <h> Zeta Function Regularization <p> Some summation methods are defined using analytic continuation of complex-valued functions . An analytic continuation of a function ( f ) is a function ( g ) , defined on a larger set than ( f ) is , which is ( complex ) differentiable everywhere on its domain . <p> The motivating example is the Riemann zeta function zeta(s) = sumn=1infty frac1ns . This only converges for ( textRe(s) &gt; 1 ) , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) function to a function that is well-defined and differentiable everywhere except for ( s =1 ) . This functional equation allows the computation zeta(-1) = -frac112 ( big()in general , if ( n ) is a positive integer , ( zeta(-n) = -fracBn+1n+1 ) , where ( Bk ) are the Bernoulli numbers(big) . ) So plugging in ( s=-1 ) to the series representation of the ( zeta ) function yields 1+2+3+cdots = -frac112 . It turns out that this sum has practical applications in string theory and in a computation of the one-dimensional Casimir effect in quantum mechanics . In the latter context , the zeta function regularization corresponds to an assumption about the model that accounts for the " cancellation of the infinite part " of the sum . <p> The general idea is the same : the function ( sum an-s ) might converge in some complex half-plane , but if it can be analytically continued to a function defined for ( s = -1 ) , associate the value of the function at ( -1 ) with the sum of the series . Note @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dirichlet Series Regularization <p> Another idea that is sometimes ( incorrectly ) called zeta function regularization is to use the Dirichlet series f(s) = sumn=0infty fracanns and assign the sum the value of ( f(0) ) , if ( f ) can be analytically continued to ( 0 ) . This is a different method than zeta function regularization : indeed , it is linear but not stable . ( big()Note that it also gives ( 1+2+3+cdots=-frac112. big ) ) <h> Applications <p> Sums of divergent series often have applications in physics , as with the ( 1+2+3+cdots ) example above . The general idea is that if a physical situation is described by a function ( f ) defined by a series that is only convergent for some set of values not including ( s ) , an analytic continuation ( g ) of ( f ) to some larger set of values including ( s ) is related closely enough to ( f ) that ( g(s) ) can have some meaningful physical interpretation even though ( f(s) ) is undefined . <p> There are less mysterious situations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well . The following ( long ) example is related by Matt Noonan . <p> The Catalan numbers count ( among many other objects ) rooted left-right-ordered binary trees with ( n ) vertices . Here a tree is a set of vertices , which are connected to children one level below and a parent one level above . " Rooted " means there is one vertex at the top , " left-right-ordered " means that every child is labeled either a left child or a right child , and " binary " means that every parent has at most two children--and if there are two , one must be a left child and the other a right child . <p> The generating function for the Catalan numbers is F(z) = frac1-sqrt1-4z2z = **28;491;TOOLONG ( this is a straightforward application of the fractional binomial theorem ) . The series has radius of convergence ( frac 14 , ) but ( F(1) = frac12-ifracsqrt32 ) . Think of ( F(1) ) as counting all of the rooted ordered binary trees , although of course the series defining ( F(1) ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ( F(z)7 ) is the generating function for 7-tuples of rooted ordered binary trees . So this suggests that there is a " natural " bijective way to identify a 7-tuple of rooted ordered binary trees with a unique rooted ordered binary tree , and this turns out to be the case ! See this paper for details . <p> The point here is that the identity for divergent series sums has a straightforward and natural interpretation as a statement about a bijection between two equal-sized sets . This is how applications of sums of divergent series often work : instead of solving down-to-earth problems directly , they give clues to the correct solution , that can later be justified rigorously by other methods .

So , if no friction is acting on it , then why does the ball come to rest ?

Rolling friction occurs because the objects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a ball is placed on a rough surface , only one point of the ball touches the ground .

@@77511673 @6211673/ <h> Method of Differences 26449 @qwx646449 <p> The method of finite differences gives us a way to calculate a polynomial using its values at several consecutive points . This is often a good approach to finding the general term in a pattern , if we suspect that it follows a polynomial form . <h> Contents <h> Difference Table <p> Suppose we are given several consecutive integer points at which a polynomial is evaluated . What information does this tell us about the polynomial ? To answer this question , we create the following table , known as the difference table : <p> Note that since we are not given ( f(6) ) , we are unable to calculate ( D1(5) , D2(4) , D3(3) ) or ( D4(2) ) . Now , there is n't ( yet ) any reason why this table would ever end ; if we are given infinitely many values , we can always calculate the differences of terms . However , here is an interesting fact . <p> If a polynomial ( f(x) ) has degree ( k ) , then the ( ktextth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) difference is equal to ( k ! ) times the leading coefficient of ( f(x). square ) <p> In the above example , we see that ( D2 ( 1 ) = D2(2) = D2 ( 3 ) = 2 ) . Since ( f(x) ) is a quadratic polynomial , the above fact tells us that ( D2(n) = 2 ) for all ( n ) , and this allows us to fill in other entries in the table . We get that ( D2(4) = 2 ) so ( D1 ( 5 ) = 7 ) and hence ( f(6) = 19 ) . These values are previously unknown to us , but the difference table allows us to calculate them without knowing the polynomial ( f(x) ) ! <p> From the above , we know that ( D3(n) ) is a constant , and thus it is equal to 4 . This allows us to complete the table as follows . Note that we want to calculate ( g(5) ) and thus need to extend the table by more rows . <h> Proof of Theorem <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , then the ( ktextth ) difference is constant . Furthermore , the ( ktextth ) difference is equal to ( k ! ) times the leading coefficient of ( f(x). square ) <p> implying that there are no terms of degree ( nk ) in ( D1(n) ) . Furthermore , the coefficient of ( nk-1 ) comes solely from the term ( ak left(n+1)k - nkright ) , and is equal to ( k ak ) . <p> We may likewise continue by induction to consider the second difference , third difference , etc . Each time , we see that the degree of the polynomial decreases by 1 . Hence , by the time we get to the ( ktextth ) difference , it is a polynomial of degree 0 . Since the only polynomials of degree 0 are the constants , this implies ( Dk(n) ) is a constant polynomial . <p> What happens to the leading coefficient at each step ? We see that it gets multiplied by the degree of the ( current ) polynomial . Since the degree decreases by 1 at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( k times ( k-1 ) times cdots times 2 times 1 = k ! ) . Hence , we have ( Dk = ak times k ! ) or ( ak = fracDk k ! ) . ( square ) <p> If we have an entire row of the difference table , we can reconstruct the polynomial using the following theorem : <p> As worked out in the above example , this theorem is true for the special case of the polynomial ( fk ( n ) ) . Observe that for any 2 polynomials ( g(n) ) and ( h(n) ) , we clearly have ( Di ( g+h ) ( n ) = Di g(n) + Di h(n) ) , and ( Di ( alpha g ) ( n ) = alpha Di g ( n ) ) . Hence , the theorem is true for any polynomial that can be written as a linear combination of ( fk ( n ) ) . <p> Now , given any polynomial ( f(n) ) of degree ( k ) , we will show that there are unique coefficients @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ + sumi=1k alphai fi ( n ) . <p> These coefficients can be obtained by setting ( n = 2 ) to find ( alpha1 ) , and then setting ( n = 3 ) to find ( alpha2 ) , so on and so forth . We get an identity , because both sides are polynomials of degree at most ( k ) , which agree on ( k + 1 ) values . <p> Hence , this theorem is true for all polynomials ( f(n) ) . ( square ) <p> ( ) Note : Many people are answering this incorrectly because they think it is the Fibonacci sequence , but this problem is asking about a quintic polynomial that passes through those points .

When the vibrations produced by strings are impressed on the enclosed air , they produce forced vibrations and a loud sound is heard . - - <p> When the needle of a gramophone player moves in the grooves of a record , it produces forced vibrations . <h> Resonance <p> Definition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of an applied external force is equal to , or is an integral multiple of , the natural frequency of the body on which the force is applied , such that it readily takes up the vibrations and begins to vibrate with an increased amplitude . - - <p> Conditions for the phenomenon of resonance : <p> The natural frequency of the given body must be equal to , or is an integral multiple of , the frequency of the external force . - - <p> The vibrating body must have sufficient force so that it can set the other body into vibrations . <p> - Examples of resonance : <p> It is a common experience that the frame of a motor cycle starts vibrating violently when driven at some particular speed . The reason is that at this time the natural frequency of the frame matches with the frequency of the piston of the engine , causing resonance . <p> Soldiers are often asked to break their steps while crossing a bridge . This precaution is taken to prevent any sudden collapse of the bridge , which may occur @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ due to footsteps of the soldiers with the natural frequency of bridge . <p> When the radio station broadcasts at some particular wavelength or frequency , these waves are received by the antenna in which they produce forced vibrations . When the person at the receiving end tunes his radio , he is in a way changing the natural frequency of the radio set . When the natural frequency of the radio set corresponds to the frequency of the broadcasting station , resonance takes place . Thus , the radio signals are amplified . These signals are further processed in the radio , and hence the sound is amplified . <h> Vibrations in a Stretched String <p> Whenever a string is plucked , it starts vibrating with a specific frequency . The frequency of the note depends upon the following factors : <p> Law of length : The frequency of a note produced by a stretched string is inversely proportional to its length . <p> Law of tension : The frequency of a note produced by a stretched string is directly proportional to the square root of the tension in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a note produced in a stretched string is inversely proportional to the square root of the mass per unit length of the string . <p> Terms to remember : <p> Node : Node is a point on the vibrating string with maximum tension and minimum displacement . <p> Antinode : Antinode is the point on the vibrating string with maximum displacement and zero tension . <p> Principal note or first harmonic or fundamental note : If a wire is made to vibrate in ( 2 ) nodes and ( 3 ) antinodes , then the note produced is called pricipal note or fundamental note or first harmonic . <p> First harmonic <p> Second harmonic or first octave : If a wire is made to vibrate in ( 3 ) nodes and ( 2 ) antinodes , then the note produced is called principal note or second harmonic or first octave . <p> Second harmonic <p> Two strings of guitar are of length ( 80text cm ) and ( 60text cm ) , respectively , are made from the same material , and are of the same thickness and under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wire is ( 300text Hz ) , find the frequency of the smaller wire . <h> Musical Sound and Noise <p> Sound waves which produce pleasant sensation in our ears and are acceptable are called musical sounds . Sound waves which produce unpleasant sensation in our ears and are unacceptable are called noise . However , it is difficult to differentiate between musical sound and noise because a particular sound may be pleasant and acceptable to someone , but it may be unpleasant and unacceptable to others . Generally , sound waves which are produced by regular periodic vibrations are musical in character , but those produced by irregular non-periodic vibrations of a body are non-musical in character or noise . <p> Loudness or intensity ( ) Intensity of sound is the time rate at which the sound energy flows through a unit area . Loudness is the sensation produced in the brain by the combined effect of intensity and response of the ear : ( ) beginalign text Intensity &amp;propto text Amplitude2 text Intensity &amp;propto dfrac 1text Distance2 text Intensity &amp;propto text Density of the medium . endalign ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of sound is measured in decibels ( dB ) . One decibel is defined as the change in loudness of sound when the intensity increases by ( 26% ) . <p> Quality or timbre ( ) The notes of different musical instruments are distinguished by this characteristic . It is because different waveforms are produced by different musical instruments . Sound produced by musical instruments differ in wavelength , loudness and waveform . The waveforms differ because a musical instrument produces a number of subsidiary notes other than the main note and this difference depends upon the shape , size and material of the instruments . This is the same reason why few people are really singers because the quality of sound produced by them is far superior and has a more pleasant sensation on our ears .

@@77511683 @6211683/ <h> Contents <h> Addition Reaction <p> The addition reaction , as its name implies , is simply the addition of an atom or a group to compound . For example , a hydrogen molecule can be added to acetylene to produce ethylene , and ethylene can again be added to a hydrogen molecule to form ethane , as shown in the figure below : <p> ( qquad qquad ) <p> Imgur <p> However , ethane can not participate in an addition reaction with hydrogen , because ethane is fully saturated . <p> A famous application of the addition reaction is the bromination of hydrocarbons . It is used to determine whether a hydrocarbon is saturated or not . Bromine ( ( textBr2 ) ) itself has a unique brownish color . If bromine is added to an unsaturated hydrocarbon ( e.g. alkene or alkyne ) solution , then bromine will add to the hydrocarbon . As bromine is consumed , the solution will lose the brownish color . However if bromine is added to a saturated hydrocarbon solution , bromine will not react with the hydrocarbon , and thus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The substitution reaction , can be simply thought of replacing an atom with a different one .

On the other hand , unsaturated compounds like alkenes or alkynes tend to participate in addition reactions rather than substitution reactions . <h> Oxidation and Reduction <p> Oxidation is the process of losing electrons , whereas reduction is gaining electrons . When it comes to organic chemistry , most redox reactions involve the gaining/losing hydrogen or oxygen atoms . Gaining an oxygen atom usually means oxidation , and losing one means reduction . On the other hand gaining a hydrogen atom means reduction , while losing one means oxidation . A well known example is the oxidation and reduction of alcohols , aldehydes , ketones , and carboxylic acids . <p> ( hspace4cm ) <p> Imgur <p> In the figure above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oxidation . Likewise ( textH ) means gaining two hydrogen atoms , which is equivalent to reduction . Primary alcohols oxidize to form aldehydes , which then can oxidize again to produce carboxylic acids . Reversely , carboxylic acids can be reduced to form aldehydes , which again can be reduced to primary alcohols . Secondary alcohols can oxidize once to form ketones . <h> Esterification <p> Esterification is a condensation reaction between an alcohol and a carboxylic acid to produce an ester . One alcohol molecule will react with one carboxylic acid molecule to produce one ester molecule and one water molecule . During the process , a water molecule is formed , because the hydroxyl group from the carboxylic acid and a hydrogen atom from the alcohol are removed while the ester is formed , as shown in the figure below : <p> ( hspace4cm ) <p> Imgur <p> 120 grams of acetic acid ( ( textCH3textCOOH ) ) reacts with 68 grams of ( 18textO ) -methanol ( ( textCH318textOH ) ) to form methyl acetate .

Thus the esterification reaction will produce 2 moles of methyl acetate and 2 moles of water . Observe from the figure above that the 18-oxygen all stays in methyl acetate , instead of water .

@@77511684 @6211684/ 26449 @qwx646449 <p> The limit of a function at a point ( a ) in its domain ( if it exists ) is the value that the function approaches as its argument approaches ( a . ) The concept of a limit is the fundamental concept of calculus and analysis . It is used to define the derivative and the definite integral , and it can also be used to analyze the local behavior of functions near points of interest . <p> Informally , a function is said to have a limit ( L ) at ( a ) if it is possible to make the function arbitrarily close to ( L ) by choosing values closer and closer to ( a ) . Note that the actual value at ( a ) is irrelevant to the value of the limit . <p> The limit of ( f(x) ) at ( x0 ) is the y-coordinate of the red point , not ( f(x0). ) 1 <p> The notation is as follows : <p> limx to a f(x) = L , <p> which is read as " the limit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a ) is ( L ) " . <p> In practice , this definition is only used in relatively unusual situations . For many applications , it is easier to use the definition to prove some basic properties of limits , and to use those properties to answer straightforward questions involving limits . <h> Properties of limits <p> The most important properties of limits are the algebraic properties , which say essentially that limits respect algebraic operations : <p> These can all be proved via application of the epsilon-delta definition . Note that the results are only true if the limits of the individual functions exist : if ( limlimitsxto a f(x) ) and ( limlimitsxto a g(x) ) do not exist , the limit of their sum ( or difference , product , or quotient ) might nevertheless exist . <p> Coupled with the basic limits ( limxto a c = c ) where ( c ) is a constant , and ( limxto a x = a , ) the properties can be used to deduce limits involving rational functions : <p> Immediately substituting ( x=1 ) does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) First divide top and bottom by ( x-1 ) to get LONG ... Plugging in ( x=1 ) to the denominator does not give ( 0 , ) so the limit is this fraction evaluated at ( x=1 , ) which is LONG ... = fracmn . <p> It is important to notice that the manipulations in the above example are justified by the fact that ( limlimitsxto a f(x) ) is independent of the value of ( f(x) ) at ( x=a , ) or whether that value exists . This justifies , for instance , dividing the top and bottom of the fraction ( dfracxm-1xn-1 ) by ( x-1 , ) since this is nonzero for ( xne 1 . ) <h> One-Sided Limits <p> A one-sided limit only considers values of a function that approach a value from either above or below . <p> The right side limit of a function ( f ) as it approaches ( a ) is the limit limx to a+ f(x) = L. <p> The left side limit of a function ( f ) islimx to a- f(x) = @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " indicates that we only consider values of ( x ) that are less than ( a ) when evaluating the limit . Likewise for " ( x to a+ ) " we consider only values greater than ( a ) . One-sided limits are important when evaluating limits containing absolute values ( x ) , sign ( textsgn(x) ) , floor functions ( lfloor x rfloor ) , and for other piecewise functions . <p> graph <p> The image above demonstrates both left- and right-sided limits on a continuous function ( f(x) . ) <h> Find the left and right side limits of the signum function ( ( textsgn(x) ) ) as ( x to 0 ) : <h> The image below is a graph of a function ( f(x) ) . As shown , it is continuous for all points except ( x = -1 ) and ( x=2 ) which are its asymptotes . Find all the integer points ( -4 &lt;I &lt; 4 ) where the two sided limit ( limx to I f(x) ) exists . <p> image <p> Since the graph is continuous at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the two sided limit exists at ( x=-3 ) , ( x=-2 ) , ( x=0 ) , ( x=1 ) and ( x=3 ) . At ( x=2 , ) there is no finite value for either of the two-sided limits , since the function increases without bound as the ( x ) -coordinate approaches ( 2 ) ( but see the next section for a further discussion ) . The situation is similar for ( x=-1 . ) So the points ( x=-3 ) , ( x=-2 ) , ( x=0 ) , ( x=1 , ) and ( x=3 ) are all the integers on which two-sided limits are defined . <h> Infinite limits <p> As seen in the previous section , one way for a limit not to exist is for the one-sided limits to disagree . Another common way for a limit to not exist at a point ( a ) is for the function to " blow up " near ( a , ) i.e. the function increases without bound . This happens in the above example at ( x=2 , ) where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rise to the following notation : <p> Given a function ( f(x) ) and a real number ( a , ) we say limxto a f(x) = infty If the function can be made arbitrarily large by moving ( x ) sufficiently close to ( a ) : textfor all N&gt;0 , text there exists delta&gt;0 text such that 0&lt;x-a&lt;delta Rightarrow f(x)&gt;N . <p> There are similar definitions for one-sided limits , as well as limits " approaching ( -infty ) . " <p> Warning : If ( limlimitsxto a f(x) = infty , ) it is tempting to say that the limit at ( a ) exists and equals ( infty . ) This is incorrect . If ( limlimitsxto a f(x) = infty , ) the limit does not exist ; the notation merely gives information about the way in which the limit fails to exist , i.e. the value of the function " approaches ( infty ) " or increases without bound as ( x rightarrow a ) . <p> What can we say about ( limx to 0 frac1x ) ? <p> Separating the limit into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 0- frac1x ) , we obtain limx to 0+ frac1x = infty and limx to 0- frac1x = -infty . To prove the first statement , for any ( N&gt;0 ) in the formal definition we can take ( delta = 1/N , ) and the proof of the second statement is similar . <p> So the function increases without bound on the right side and decreases without bound on the left side .

You may be wondering how we obtained the expression in blue color , well if we define it in an easy way , the basic cause of refraction is due to the change in velocity of light by entering a medium of different refractive index . So , if a medium has less refractive index , then the velocity of light in that medium would be more but if a medium has more refractive index then the velocity of light in that medium would be comparatively less . <p> Question : A ray of light travelling in air is incident on the plane surface of a transparent medium .

This shift depends upon the angle of incidence , the angle of refraction and the thickness of the medium .

But the hot air has a refractive index lower than the cold air , that is hot air is optically rarer than cold air , and we know if a ray of light passes through a rarer medium from a denser medium , then the light rays bend away from the normal .

If the three side lengths are equal , the structure of the triangle is determined ( a consequence of SSS congruence ) . However , this is not always possible . <p> Another useful criterion is that the three angles of an equilateral triangle are equal as well , and are thus each ( 60circ ) . Since the angles opposite equal sides are themselves equal , this means discovering two equal sides and any ( 60circ ) angle is sufficient to conclude the triangle is equilateral , as is discovering two equal angles of ( 60circ ) .

But with the tools we 've built up thus far , we 'll be able to solve these problems in no time ! <p> Let 's begin with an example to help spark some ideas about clever ways to write our random variable as a sum of simpler random variables : <h> A box contains a yellow ball , an orange ball , a green ball , and a blue ball . Billy randomly selects 4 balls from the box ( with replacement ) . What is the expected value for the number of distinct colored balls Billy will select ? <p> Solution : We want to find the expected value of the number of distinct colors Billy selects . We could directly compute the probabilities that Billy selects ( k=1,2,3,4 ) distinct colors , but this is a little bit messy ( and would be even harder if there were many more than 4 balls ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expectation might be helpful ! <p> Now , we need to think about how to write the number of distinct colors Billy selects as a sum of some other random variables . To get started , suppose Billy 's four selections were as follows : <p> How would you determine the number of distinct colors Billy has selected ? Well , looking at the image above , Billy has chosen the orange , green , and blue balls , but he has n't chosen the yellow ball , so that 's 3 distinct colors . If you 're thinking to yourself , " yeah sure , I know how to count already ! " , hang tight -- here 's where the magic happens . <p> Since our random variable is just counting how many of the colors have been selected , we can think of it as a sum of four random variables : one for each color , which is equal to 1 if the color is selected and 0 if it is not . So , in the example above , the orange , green , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ random variable would be 0 . Adding these up gives a total of 3 distinct colored balls selected . <p> Furthermore , the expectancy of any of these four random variables is simple to compute . In fact , using the basic definition of expected value , we see that its expectancy is simply equal to the probability that the color is selected . Using complimentary probability techniques , we find that the probability that an arbitrary color ( let 's say yellow ) is selected is <p> Finally , by linearity of expectation , the expected value for the number of distinct colored balls that Billy will select is <p> 4cdot frac175256 = frac17564 approx 2.73. square <p> Let 's reflect on this example and see what important ideas we have used and developed : <p> Linearity of expectation helped us compute a seemingly complicated expected value and in a very simple way ( albeit after using a clever insight -- but these will become second nature with more practice ) ! <p> Linearity of expectation allowed us to not worry about the fact that we were considering a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are dependent : for example , if three of them are 0 , then the fourth must be 1 ( since at least one color must be selected ) . However , as we proved at the beginning of this page , linearity of expectation holds for all random variables , regardless of independence . <p> Because our random variable counted something ( e.g. , the number of distinct colored balls ) , we were able to write it as a sum of random variables that indicated which things should be counted ( e.g. , a 1 for each color which was selected ) . <p> Looking at this last point , it is actually quite reminiscent of how we solved the earlier example with Caroline 's coin flipping when we counted the number of heads she flipped by summing over random variables which indicated , for each coin , whether or not it was heads . In fact , there is a formal term for such a random variable : <p> An indicator random variable on an event ( t ) , often denoted as ( mathbb1t ) is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t ) occurs and 0 if ( t ) does not occur . By the definition of expected value , <p> These indicator variables can be extremely helpful for solving problems with linearity of expectation , especially when it is simple to compute their expectancy ( that is , the probability of the event occurring ) . Using this idea , you 're ready to take on a problem that would otherwise be essentially impossible to solve in a simple , clean way . <p> 25 independent , fair coins are tossed in a row . What is the expected number of consecutive HH pairs ? <p> Details and assumptions : <p> If 6 coin tosses in a row give HHTHHH , the number of consecutive HH pairs is 3 . <p> To summarize , using linearity of expectation with indicator variables is often useful when : <p> A problem looks like it could be solved using linearity of expectation . <p> There is not an obvious way to write the random variable under consideration as a sum of simpler random variables . <p> The random variable under consideration is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simple events . <h> Using States <p> In this section , we 'll introduce a technique for applying linearity of expectation when the random variable under consideration measures the amount of time or number of steps it takes to complete some sort of process . If that sounds a little vague , let 's consider the following simple example to introduce this idea of " states " within a process : <h> Allison has an unfair coin which lands on heads with probability ( p . ) What is the expected value for the number of times she will have to flip the coin until she flips a heads ? <p> Solution : At first glance , our random variable is certainly counting simple events , so it seems like indicator variables might help . We just need to count the number of tails we flip , and each flip is tails with probability ( 1-p . ) But there 's a major problem ! We do n't know how many of these flips should be in our sum ; in fact , that is almost precisely the question being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in terms of " completing a process " in which there are multiple states . Here , the states are simple : we have either not yet flipped a head ( let 's call this state 0 ) , or we have flipped a head ( let 's call this state 1 ) . <p> Now , let ( EleftXiright ) denote the expected number of flips needed to complete the process ( flip the first head ) given that we are in state ( i . ) It should be clear that ( EleftX1 right = 0 , ) since state 1 means we have flipped a head so the process is completed . On the other hand , once we flip in state 0 , we will remain in state 0 with probability ( 1-p ) and we will move to state 1 with probability ( p . ) Thus , considering our state after the first flip in state 0 , we have : <p> Let 's look at a more complicated example using states , in which we 'll be able to directly apply the result @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SlurpeeShack , you receive one random piece of the puzzle seen above . Once you collect all 12 pieces , you get a free slurpee ! What is the expected value for the number of purchases you will need to make in order to collect all 12 pieces ? <p> Solution : Here , our states are how many distinct coupons we have . Let ( Xi ) denote the number of purchases we need to make to get the ( itextth ) distinct coupon , so the random variable under consideration is ( sumi=112 Xi . ) <p> Once you have ( i-1 ) distinct coupons , the probability of getting a new one on any given purchase is ( frac12-(i-1)12 . ) As derived in the previous example , the expected number of purchases needed will be ( EleftXiright = frac1212-(i-1) . ) Thus , by linearity of expectation , Eleftsumi=112 Xi right = sumi=112 EleftXiright = sumi=112 frac1212-(i-1) = frac1212 + frac1211 + ldots + frac121 = frac860212310 approx 37. square <p> Bonus : This is a famous problem , often referred to as the Coupon Collector @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the expected value for the number of purchases will be ( ncdot Hn ) where ( Hn = sumi=1n frac1i ) is the ( ntextth ) harmonic number . It can be shown with Calculus that , for large ( n , ) ( Hn approx ln n , ) so the expected value is approximately ( n ln n . ) <p> As we 've seen , the method of states is useful when we can write our random variable as the sum of other random variables which measure the amount of time/steps it takes to get from one state to the next . If you 're looking for an additional challenge , try this problem where the states are even less obvious : <p> Sarah the squirrel is trying to find her acorn , but she ca n't remember where she left it !

However , there are also many real-world and cross-discipline uses of linearity of expectation , and in this section we 'll explore a few of those . <p> Let 's begin by considering lotteries . <p> There is a lottery contest in which participants pay $1 to choose 5 distinct numbers from the integers ( 1-50 . ) The lottery company offers a $2,500,000 prize if someone guesses the correct 5 numbers ( and the prize will be split among all winners if there are multiple correct participants ) . <p> We know from combinations that there are ( binom505 = 2,118,760 ) possible choices . But wait -- by the pigeonhole principle , this means that if we just get a group of ( 2,118,760 ) people to each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money from the lottery company ! <p> While that 's true , lottery companies know that participants usually do n't have the resources to coordinate in such a way . Instead , they may assume that each person likely chooses their numbers random . In this case , and ( n ) people participate in a lottery with ( m ) possible choices , what is the probability that some participant wins ? <p> Solution : Let ( Xi ) be an indicator variable on the event that lottery combination ( 1 le i le m ) is not chosen by any participants . Since each person choses randomly , <p> EleftXiright = left ( 1 - frac1mright ) n <p> for all ( i . ) By linearity of expectation , the expected value for the number of unchosen combinations is <p> For example , in our lottery with 2,118,760 choices and 2,118,760 participants , the probability that someone wins is approximately 63%. ( square ) <p> Bonus : What happens when as ( m , ) the number of possible choices , becomes very large ? How does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if the number of participants were to increase ? Hint : The result involves a famous limit of a sequence related to the constant ( e . ) <p> It 's very cool to see how we were able to apply our skills with linearity of expectation to discover an interesting fact about real-world lotteries ! Let 's turn to something with a very different flavor : a famous geometric probability question . <p> Suppose a needle of length 1 is dropped onto a floor with strips of wood 1 unit apart . What is the probability that the needle will land across two strips of wood ? <p> The traditional solution to this problem uses Calculus , but we 're going to show how to solve it with linearity of expectation instead ! <p> Solution : First , we 're going to argue that the expected number of times a needle crosses the strips of woods is directly proportional to the length ( l ) of the needle . Suppose that the needle is made up of ( n ) linear pieces of equal length , and let ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) piece crossing two strips of wood . Then , the expected number of total crosses , by linearity of expectation , is Eleftsumi=1n Xiright = sumi=1n EleftXiright = n cdot EleftX1right . Holding the length of these small pieces constant , we see that the expected number of times is proportional to the length of the needle ( admittedly , this is a little bit of hand-waving , but the intuition should be clear ) . <p> Thus , as a function of the length ( l , ) the expected number of crossings is ( cl ) for some constant ( c . ) However , consider a circle with diameter 1 ( so circumference ( pi ) ) ; with probability 1 , this circle will intersect exactly 2 of the wood-crossings . Hence , ( cpi = 2 , ) so ( c = frac2pi . ) If you 're uncomfortable with the idea of a circle , consider approximating the circle by combining a bunch of very , very small linear segments . <p> For any needle ( such as ours ) which can intersect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in fact an indicator variable on the event that the needle lands across two strips of wood , so the expected value is precisely the probability of this occurring . Thus , the probability of a crossing with a needle of length 1 is simply ( frac2piapprox 64%. square ) <p> Bonus : Can you think about how you could use this result to estimate the value of ( pi ) via a Monte-Carlo simulation ? <p> Here are some other examples which can be tackled with linearity of expectation : <h> Many questions about expected values in random graphs can be answered with linearity of expectation . For example , suppose that there is a group of ( n ) potential friends , and each pair of people becomes friends with probability ( frac12 ) . What is the expected value for the number of " friend-triplets " ; e.g. , groups of three people who are all mutually friends ? <p> Solution : Note that there are ( binomn3 ) such triplets , and each triplet is a friend triplet with probability ( left(frac12right)3 = frac18 . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the ( itextth ) triplet being a friend triplet , then the expected number of friend triplets is

@@77511705 @6211705/ <p> In mathematics , the method of infinite descent is a proof technique that uses the fact that there are a finite number of positive integers less than any given positive integer . The method relies on the fact that the set of non-negative integers follows the well-ordering principle , so only a finite number of non-negative integers are smaller than any given one .

Let ( x2equiv s ) and ( y2equiv tpmod 7 ) for some ( s , tin Q ) . So we have ( x2+y2equiv s+tequiv 0pmod 7 ) . But see that we ca n't choose two elements from ( Q ) so that there sum is divisible by ( 7 ) , except for ( s=t=0 ) . That means ( x2equiv y2equiv 0pmod 7 ) hence ( 7mid x , 7mid y ) as ( 7 ) is a prime . ( square ) <p> Now since we had ( 7mid p2+q2 ) , we now know that ( 7mid p ) and ( 7mid q ) .

The above proof should be written in more formal terms , and is left to the reader . <h> General Diophantine Equation <p> FMID may seem confusing at first , so let 's see it in action with an example problem . We all know that ( sqrt32 ) is an irrational number . We 're going to see a proof of it using FMID . <h> Proof that ( sqrt32 ) is irrational <p> Let 's assume the contrary and see what happens . Let ( sqrt32=fracx1y1 ) where ( x1 ) and ( y1 ) are positive integers . Cubing and re-arranging gives us : <p> x13=2y13 <p> Now this is a Diophantine equation . Finding the solutions to it will give us the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( sqrt32 ) . Since the right-hand-side is even , it means the left-hand-side should be too . <p> In other words , ( x1=2x2 ) where ( x2 in mathbbZ+ ) and ( x1&gt;x2 ) . Plugging that in and simplifying gives us : <p> 4x23=y13 <p> This time the left side is even . So by a similar argument , ( y1=2y2 ) where ( y2in mathbbZ+ ) and ( y1&gt;y2 ) . What happens when we plug this in ? <p> A little simplification gives us something like these : <p> x23=2y23 <p> Looks familiar ? Well , it 's the same equation we started with . This means if we have a solution ( ( x1 , y1 ) ) , it is possible to find a another solution ( ( x2 , y2 ) ) to it . <p> But by repeating this procedure , we can generate an infinite sequence of strictly decreasing positive integers ( x1&gt;x2&gt;x3&gt;cdots ) and that is not possible . This is the key to FMID . You have to show that if one solution exists , there exist infinitely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're done . Because you can never have an infinite sequence of strictly decreasing non-negative integers . So , there was never a solution to begin with . <p> In our case , the diophantine equation ( x13=2y13 ) has no solution in positive integers . <p> So , ( sqrt32 ) can not be equal to ( fracxy ) where ( x ) and ( y ) are positive integers and that completes our proof . ( square ) <p> Now that we 've gotten a little hang of what FMID is all about , we can proceed to a more formal formulation of it . But before that , let 's get some notations straight . <p> For example , let ( P ) be the property of being divisible by ( 3 ) . Then ( P(15) ) is true , but ( P(13) ) is n't . <h> Solve ( x3+2y3=4z3 ) in non-negative integers . <p> Notice that ( ( 0 , 0 , 0 ) ) is a solution .

Plugging these in and simplifying gives us ( x23+ 2y23=4z23 ) . This way , we obtain a new solution ( ( x2 , y2 , z2 ) ) to our equation with ( x1&gt;x2 ) , ( y1&gt;y2 ) and ( z1&gt;z2 ) . But by repeating the procedure , we can construct infinitely many solutions ( ( xi , yi , zi ) ) where ( x1&gt;x2&gt;x3&gt;cdots ) which contradicts FMID variant - ( 1 ) . <p> So there can be no other solutions . ( square ) <h> Identifying Appropriate Uses of FMID <p> Now that we know a bit about the proof method , let 's talk about how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cases you wo n't recognize FMID problems straight away . But if you see that after manipulating an equation , you are left with an equation that is quite similar to the one that you started with , then you can think about applying FMID .

But we were then left with an equation identical to the one we started out with .

A deep In-The-Money call behaves as if one is long the underlying , and hence the corresponding delta is 1 . A deep Out-of-The-Money call would have very little change in price as the underlying moves , hence the delta is 0 . The range of delta for a call is ( 0 , 1 ) . <p> Similarly , the delta of a put option is negative , since a decrease in the stock price would make the put worth more .

This is easy to differentiate since the delta value is bounded . The main case of confusion could arise when talking about a delta 1 call , in which case it would have to be inferred through context . <p> An ITM call will approach a delta of 1 as it gets closer to expiry , since the extrinsic value is minimal , and the intrinsic value has a delta of 1 . Likewise , an OTM call will approach a delta of 0 as it gets close to expiry , since the intrinsic value has a delta of 0 . Conversely , the further out to expiry , the close the delta of a call will get to 0.5 . This is because we are less certain if the call will be ITM or OTM .

This is given by <p> Delta1% = Delta times 1 % times S. <h> Implications of Put-Call Parity on Delta <p> The Put-Call Parity states that ( C - P = S - K e-rt ) .

Have you ever wondered why soap bubbles form the way they do ? Here is a simple soap bubble blown from a circular wand : <p> Why is the soap bubble spherical instead of another shape , such as a long and skinny ellipsoid with the same radius as the circular wand ? Try using the following soap formula to blow your own bubbles . <h> Ingredients : <p> 6 parts water <p> 1 part dishwashing liquid <p> For longer lasting bubbles , add 1/3 part glycerin or corn syrup . <p> Experiment with different types of wands , such as pipe cleaners , metal coat hangers , or flexible wire bent into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> What happens when you bend your wire into the shape of a circle and dip it into the soapy water ? The result is a film of soap stretching across the circle . Soap films adopt a shape that minimizes elastic energy due to surface area while still spanning the outline of the wand . ( In the physical world , gravity will also play a role , but we will ignore these effects for the time being . ) <p> When you blow a soap bubble , some amount of the air you blow becomes trapped within the bubble . Then the soap bubble or cluster of bubbles naturally tries to minimize surface area for the volume(s) they enclose due to surface tension . <p> Minimal surface principle : Soap bubbles try to assume the shape of least surface area possible containing a given volume . <p> Mathematically , the question of what shape the soap bubble will form is a minimization problem : the surface area seeks to be as small as possible under a constraint ( the volume is constant and the boundary spans a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problem . Let 's compare the surface areas of few different shapes with the same volume . <p> Given a regular tetrahedron with volume ( 1 textcm3 ) and a cube with volume ( 1 textcm3 ) , which object has smaller surface area ? <p> Details and Assumptions : <p> In a regular tetrahedron , all four faces are equilateral triangles , and <p> In a cube , all six faces are squares . <p> They have the same surface area Tetrahedron Not enough information Cube <p> To generalize this problem , consider the surface areas of different regular polyhedra with volume 1 cm(3) : <p> Observe that the surface area decreases as the number of sides increases for regular polyhedra . Is the sphere the shape with the minimum surface area over all shapes with volume 1 cm(3) ? While this problem was formulated by Archimedes , it was not proven until 1884 by Hermann Schwarz in the following theorem . <p> Isoperimetric theorem for three dimensions : The shape with the minimum surface area for a given volume is the sphere . <p> This theorem shows that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ area over all possible shapes . Since soap bubbles try to minimize surface area ( in the absence of other physical forces , such as gravity ) , this explains why soap bubbles form spheres instead of other shapes . <h> Clusters of Bubbles in the Plane <p> What happens when clusters of bubbles form together ? What shapes do they take ? Similar to single soap bubbles , clusters of bubbles find the minimal surface area shape that encloses multiple regions of volumes . Let 's first consider what happens in the two dimensional plane . <p> The first observation is that for fixed areas ( a1 ) and ( a2 ) , two circles that are pushed together to share a common wall separating the areas ( a1 ) and ( a2 ) has smaller perimeter than two disjoint circles . How far should these circles be pushed together ? Does this shape give the minimum perimeter over all possible shapes enclosing areas ( a1 ) and ( a2 ) ? These questions were resolved by the following theorem , proved in 1993 . <p> Double Bubble in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Foisy , Hodges , and Zimba showed the configuration of shapes with the minimum perimeter enclosing two equal areas is achieved for two intersecting circles separated by a line such that the arcs all meet at 120 degree angles : <p> The red dots indicate the angles meeting at 120 degrees . <p> Triple Bubble in Plane : In 2002 , Wichiramala showed the configuration of shapes with the minimum perimeter enclosing three equal areas is achieved for three intersecting circles such that the arcs all meet at 120 degree angles : <p> The problem of finding the optimal configurations with minimum perimeter for four or more bubbles in the plane is currently still open . The conjectured configuration of shapes follows the patterns above with all intersecting circles meeting at 120 degree angles : <p> In general , soap bubbles always meet in groups of threes at equal angles of 120 degrees . Showing configurations of four or bubbles are optimal is still an open problem -- perhaps you will be the one to make progress on these conjectures ! <h> Bee Honeycombs <p> Looking at the conjectured optimal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the following question : what happens if we consider more and more bubbles ? You might notice the pattern that the conjectured optimal configuration for more bubbles begins to resemble a hexagonal tiling of the plane . If these configurations are indeed optimal , this leads to the question : do we observe hexagonal tilings in nature ? <p> Two examples of hexagonal tilings in nature are <p> 1 ) soap film patterns formed between two glass plates <p> 2 ) bees honeycombs , which are made of wax and are created by many bees working simultaneously in different parts of the honeycomb . <p> In the 19th century , Charles Darwin observed that honeycombs were engineering feats " absolutely perfect in economising labour and wax . " <p> For a single bee storing a fixed amount of honey , we have seen that the shape with the smallest perimeter to store the fixed amount of honey is the circle . However , if we pack circles side-by-side in the plane , then these circles will leave gaps rather than filling the entire space . In other words , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be minimizing the sum of perimeters for the total amount of honey being stored . Bees have instead found a solution that minimizes the collective perimeter for the total amount of honey . <p> A polygon can tile the plane if congruent copies of the polygon cover the plane without any gaps or overlaps . Which of the following regular polygons can tile the plane ? <p> The Ancient Greeks knew that perimeter enclosing a fixed area of a hexagon is less than the perimeter of a square or triangle of the same area . However , there is no reason that the cells must all have equal side lengths , or why the cells do not have curved sides rather than straight sides . <p> The Honeycomb Conjecture remained unproved for centuries until Thomas C. Hales gave a proof in 1999 . <p> Honeycomb Theorem ( Hales ) : The hexagonal grid gives the best way to divide a surface into regions of equal area with the smallest total perimeter . <p> If the tiling has curved sides , then the side that bulges out will minimize the cell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the perimeter . Hales proved that the advantage of bulging out is less than the disadvantage of bulging in . In other words , no single cell can do better than a hexagon if it pays a penalty for having more than six sides or if it curves outwards . This gave a complete proof that polygon with straight sides work better than curved sides and a hexagonal tiling is the best of all configurations . Note that in a hexagonal tiling , the meeting points are always formed by triples of lines meeting at 120 degree angles . See below for our challenge #why120degrees <h> Soap Bubbles in Space <p> More complicated forms occur when multiple bubbles are joined together in space . The simplest example is the double bubble , and beautiful configurations can form when three or more bubbles are joined together . <p> Double Bubble Theorem : The configuration enclosing two fixed volumes with the minimum possible surface area is formed by two intersecting spheres meeting at angles of 120 degrees on a common circle . <p> If the two bubbles in the double bubble enclose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spheres meet is a flat circle . If the two bubbles enclose different volumes , then the smaller bubble has a higher internal pressure and will bulge into the larger bubble . For bubbles of any size , the meeting points are always formed by triples of bubbles meeting at 120 degree angles . This 120 degree rule always holds , even for complex bubble collections such as foam . This again raises the question #why120degrees ? <p> The Triple Bubble Problem is still wide open and the conjectured optimal configuration follows the pattern above , with intersecting spheres meeting at angles of 120 degrees . <p> Soap films between two parallel circular rings forms the shape of a catenoid , with equation ( r = cosh(z) ) in cylindrical coordinates . <p> The catenoid is a minimal surface whose points are all saddle points , which means that at every point , the bend of the surface upward in one direction is matched with the bend of the surface downward in the perpendicular direction . <p> As the rings are pulled further apart , the neck will narrow until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will pop into two circular rings of film across the two parallel rings . Try this activity for yourself and experiment to find the critical separation point ! <h> Question of the Week <p> For many great problems in mathematics , the quest for a solution often leads to further questions . We have studied the minimization principle for soap bubbles and honeycombs , but another question arose : why are meeting points of minimal surfaces formed by triples of lines meeting at 120 degree angles ? Do you have any intuition for why this occurs ? We encourage you to ask your friends , your family , your teachers , and discuss with fellow Brilliant members . To entice further discussion , try making a cube frame out of wire and dip it into a soap solution . Do you get this shape ? How many 120 degree angles are there ? #why120degrees ?

We often denote a function on one variable by ( f ) . When ( x ) is an element of the domain , we say that the value of the output is ( f(x) ) . <h> Contents <h> Terminology <p> Function : A function is a relation between each element in the domain and a unique element in the codomain . This is denoted by ( f colon X rightarrow Y ) . <p> Domain : The domain of a function is the set of inputs of the function . This is denoted by ( X ) . <p> Codomain : The codomain of a function is the set of all permissible outputs . This is denoted by ( Y. ) <p> Range : The range of a function is set of all attained outputs . By definition , the range is a subset @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . <p> Image of ( A ) : The image of a set ( A ) is the set of all attained outputs whose inputs are elements in the set ( A ) . This is denoted by ( textIm(A) = , y in Y mid exists a in A , f(a) = y , . ) <p> Composition : The composition of 2 functions ( f ) and ( g ) is denoted by ( f circ g ) . In order for this function to be well defined , the range of ( g ) must be a subset of the domain of ( f ) . <p> Inverse of an element : The inverse of an element ( y ) in ( Y ) is the set of all possible values ( x ) in ( X ) such that ( f(x) = y ) . This is denoted by ( f-1 ( y ) = , x in X mid f(x) = y , ) . <p> Graph : The graph of a function is the set of all ordered pairs ( ( x , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is one that maps every value in the domain to a unique value in the codomain , such that for any given value in the range there is only one corresponding value in the domain . Injective functions are also called " one-to-one " functions . <p> Surjective : A surjective function is one that covers every element in the codomain , such that there are no elements in the codomain that are not a value of the function . In a surjective function the range and the codomain will be identical . <p> Bijective : A bijective function is both injective and surjective . <h> Further details <p> Note that the domain and codomain need not always be the set of real numbers . Other common sets that are used are the complex numbers , positive integers , people , matrices , graphs , etc . For example , consider the function ( textCitizen ( cdot ) ) which takes as input the name of a Brilliant student and outputs the country of citizenship of that student . In this case , the domain is the set of names @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of countries . In order for this to be truly a function , we must make the assumption that a student is a citizen of only 1 country . In order to deal with the possibility of dual citizenships , we must add pairs of countries to our codomain . <p> We can certainly add irrelevant items to the codomain , like alligator , purple , and Calvin . As such , we define the range of a function ( also called the image ) to be the set of all outputs . Note that by definition , the range of a function has to be a subset of the codomain . <p> The mathematical shorthand ( since mathematicians are lazy ) to state that ( f ) is a function from set ( A ) to set ( B ) is ( fcolon A to B ) . For example , since ( mathbbC ) stands for complex numbers , ( mathbbZ ) stands for integers , and ( mathbbN ) stands for positive integers , ( f colon mathbbC to mathbbN ) refers to a function from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Because we mainly deal with functions of real numbers , if the domain and codomain are not explicitly stated ( or immediately obvious from the setup ) , they are assumed to be the set of real numbers , <p> While it is common for the domain and codomain to be the same set , it is important to make a clear distinction between the two . The identity function is the unique function on a set , which maps every element to itself . We denote this function be ( textIdA colon A to A ) , where ( textIdA ( a ) = a ) for all elements ( a ) of ( A ) . <p> If we were to change the domain of a function , then we will get a different function . For example , ( textIdmathbbR colon mathbbR to mathbbR ) is a very different function from ( textIdmathbbN colon mathbbN to mathbbN ) . This is because we have ( textIdmathbbR ( 0.5 ) = 0.5 ) , while ( textIdmathbbN ( 0.5 ) ) does not make any sense . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A to B ) and ( gcolon C to D ) are equal if ( A=C ) and for all values ( a ) in ( A ) , ( f(a) = g(a) ) . The codomain is less important , since by our previous observation we can add arbitrary elements to it while not affecting the essence of the function . <p> Given a function ( fcolon A to B ) and any subset ( C subset A ) , we say that the image of ( C ) is the set of all values ( f(c) ) , where ( c ) is an element of ( C ) . Given a subset ( D subset B ) , we say that the preimage of ( D ) is the set of all values ( x ) where ( f(x) ) is an element of ( D ) . Using this terminology , we say that the range is the image of the domain . Essentially , the range is the part of the codomain that we really care about , which is why we will like to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the domain is the set of real numbers , we like to think of ( f(x) ) as the graph of the function . Conversely , given any graph , it is a function if each ( x ) -value corresponds to at most 1 ( y ) -value . Such a graph must pass the vertical line test : every vertical line cuts the graph in at most 1 point . <p> What if we want to find all possible inputs , which give a certain output ? For example , if I want to know who are all the Brilliant students that are citizens of India , I am asking for the list of students who satisfy ( textCitizen ( cdot ) = textIndia . ) The inverse of a function need not always be a function ( as in this example ) . In order for an inverse to be an actual function , the original function needs to pass the horizontal line test : every horizontal line cuts the graph in at most 1 point . <p> If the inverse is a function , we denote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and codomain of ( f-1 ) ? Can we take the inverse of any value in the codomain ? We certainly could , though it might not make sense . For example , ( textCitizen-1 ( textCalvin ) ) would not be valid . As such , we often restrict our attention to simply the range of the original function ( which , as you recall , is the image of the domain ) . What is the codomain of the inverse ? It would be the pre-image of the range . Note that the pre-image of the range need not be the entire domain of ( f ) . <p> In the event that the inverse is not a function , we can restrict our attention to a subset of the domain . Specifically , if ( fcolon A to B ) and ( C subset A ) , we define the function ( fC colon C to B ) as ( fC ( c ) = f(c) ) for all values ( c ) in ( C ) . For example , the function ( S colon mathbbR @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does not have an inverse function because it does n't satisfy the horizontal line test . However , since ( SmathbbRleq 0 ) does satisfy the horizontal line test , it has an inverse . In this case , we know that ( SmathbbRleq 0 -1 ( x ) = -sqrtx ) . <p> A function is injective ( or one-to-one ) if ( f(a1) neq f(a2) ) for any 2 distinct elements ( a1 , a2 ) in the domain . A function is surjective ( or onto ) if for every element ( b ) in the codomain , there exists an element ( a ) in the domain such that ( f(a) = b ) . A function is bijective if it is both injective and surjective . With this terminology , an injective function has an inverse that is a function . A bijective function ( fcolon A to B ) has an inverse ( which is a function by the previous observation ) whose domain is ( B ) . <p> Now that we 've built up this vocabulary , we can talk about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to compose 2 functions . For example , ( textCitizen circ textCitizen ) will not make any sense , no matter what we try to do . Let 's understand how to make composition of functions work . <p> Assuming that we have 2 functions ( f colon A to B ) and ( gcolon C to D ) , when does ( g circ f ) make sense ? Given any value ( a ) in the domain A , we must be able to apply ( g ) to the value ( f(a) ) . Hence , this implies that ( B ) must be a subset of ( C ) . With this condition , we can define ( g circ fcolon A to D ) to be equal to ( ( g circ f ) ( a ) = g ( f(a) ) ) . Note that the order of composition is important , since we might not be able to define ( f circ g ) , unless we further know that ( D ) is a subset of ( A ) . <p> For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conditions must be satisfied : <p> ( f ) is evaluated for every element in the domain ; ( Rightarrow f ) at 1 through 8 have their own evaluations ( satisfied ) . <p> ( f ) has only one evaluation for each element in the domain ; ( Rightarrow f ) at 1 through 8 each has only one output ( satisfied ) . <p> The outputs of ( f ) should be elements of the codomain ; ( Rightarrow f(5)=f(6)=3notin Y ) ( unsatisfied ) . <p> Condition 3 is not satisfied , so ( f ) is not a function ( f : X rightarrow Y. square ) <p> Let ( X = , x mid 0 le x le 3 , x in mathbbZ , ) and ( Y = mathbbZ , ) where ( mathbbZ ) is the set of integers .

( square ) <h> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here is how the proof in Euclid 's Elements proceeds . The large square is divided into a left and right rectangle . A triangle is constructed that has half the area of the left rectangle . Then another triangle is constructed that has half the area of the square on the left-most side . These two triangles are shown to be congruent , proving this square has the same area as the left rectangle . This argument is followed by a similar version for the right rectangle and the remaining square . Putting the two rectangles together to reform the square on the hypotenuse , its area is the same as the sum of the area of the other two squares . The details follow . <p> Let ( A ) , ( B ) , ( C ) be the vertices of a right triangle , with a right angle at ( A ) . Drop a perpendicular from ( A ) to the side opposite the hypotenuse in the square on the hypotenuse . That line divides the square on the hypotenuse into two rectangles , each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the legs . <p> For the formal proof , we require four elementary lemmata : <p> 1 ) If two triangles have two sides of the one equal to two sides of the other , each to each , and the angles included by those sides equal , then the triangles are congruent ( side-angle-side ) . <p> 2 ) The area of a triangle is half the area of any parallelogram on the same base and having the same altitude . <p> 3 ) The area of a rectangle is equal to the product of two adjacent sides . <p> 4 ) The area of a square is equal to the product of two of its sides ( follows from 3 ) . <p> Next , each top square is related to a triangle congruent with another triangle related in turn to one of two rectangles making up the lower square . <p> Let ( ACB ) be a right-angled triangle with right angle ( CAB ) . <p> On each of the sides ( BC ) , ( AB ) , and ( CA ) , squares @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and ( ACIH ) , in that order . The construction of squares requires the immediately preceding theorems in Euclid , and depends upon the parallel postulate . <p> From ( A ) , draw a line parallel to ( BD ) and ( CE ) . It will perpendicularly intersect ( BC ) and ( DE ) at ( K ) and ( L ) , respectively . <p> Join ( CF ) and ( AD ) , to form the triangles ( BCF ) and ( BDA ) . <p> Angles ( CAB ) and ( BAG ) are both right angles ; therefore ( C ) , ( A ) , and ( G ) are collinear . Similarly for ( B ) , ( A ) , and ( H ) . <p> Angles ( CBD ) and ( FBA ) are both right angles ; therefore angle ( ABD ) equals angle ( FBC ) , since both are the sum of a right angle and angle ( ABC ) . <p> Since ( AB ) is equal to ( FB ) and ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( ABD ) must be congruent to triangle ( FBC ) . <p> Since ( A-K-L ) is a straight line , parallel to ( BD ) , then rectangle ( BDLK ) has twice the area of triangle ( ABD ) because they share the base ( BD ) and have the same altitude ( BK ) , i.e. , a line normal to their common base , connecting the parallel lines ( BD ) and ( AL ) . ( lemma 2 ) <p> Since ( C ) is collinear with ( A ) and ( G ) , square ( BAGF ) must be twice in area to triangle ( FBC ) . <p> Therefore , rectangle ( BDLK ) must have the same area as square ( BAGF=AB2 ) . <p> Similarly , it can be shown that rectangle ( CKLE ) must have the same area as square ( ACIH = AC2 ) . <p> Let ( ABC ) represent a right triangle , with the right angle located at ( C ) , as shown on the figure . Draw the altitude from point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intersection with the side ( AB ) . Point ( D ) divides the length of the hypotenuse ( c ) into parts ( d ) and ( e ) . The new triangle ( ACD ) is similar to triangle ( ABC ) , because they both have a right angle ( by definition of the altitude ) , and they share the angle at ( A ) , meaning that the third angle ( which we will call ( theta ) will be the same in both triangles as well . By a similar reasoning , the triangle ( CBD ) is also similar to triangle ( ABC ) . The proof of similarity of the triangles requires the triangle postulate : the sum of the angles in a triangle is two right angles , and is equivalent to the parallel postulate . Similarity of the triangles leads to the equality of ratios of corresponding sides : dfrac BCAB = dfrac BDBC text and dfrac ACAB = dfrac ADAC . The fractions in the first equality are the cosines of the angle ( theta ) , whereas those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be written as BC2 = AB times BD text and AC2 = AB times AD . Summing these two equalities results in AC2 + BC2 = AB ( BD + AD ) = AB2 . Therefore , AC2 + BC2 = AB2. square <h> Algebraic Proofs <p> Two Algebraic proof using four sets of triangles <p> The theorem can be proved algebraically using four copies of a right triangle with sides ( a ) , ( b ) and ( c ) , arranged inside a square with side ( c ) as in the top half of the diagram . The triangles are similar with area ( displaystyle frac 12ab ) , while the small square has side ( b G a ) and area ( ( b G a ) 2 ) . The area of the large square is therefore <p> ( ( b-a ) 2+4frac ab2= ( b-a ) 2+2ab=a2+b2 . , ) <p> But this is a square with side ( c ) and area ( c2 ) , so <p> ( c2=a2+b2 . , ) <p> A similar proof uses four copies of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ c , as shown in the lower part of the diagram .

Instead of a square it uses a trapezoid , which can be constructed from the square in the second of the above proofs by bisecting along a diagonal of the inner square , to give the trapezoid as shown in the diagram . The area of the trapezoid can be calculated to be half the area of the square , that is , <p> ( frac 12(b+a)2 . ) <p> The inner square is similarly halved , and there are only two triangles so the proof proceeds as above except for a factor of ( frac12 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give the result . 
@@77511749 @6211749/ <h> Contents <h> Basic Formula <p> This is the most common formula used and is likely the first one that you have seen . <p> For a triangle with base ( b ) and height ( h ) , the area ( A ) is given by <p> A = frac12 b times h. square <p> Observe that this is exactly half the area of a rectangle which has the same base and height . The proof for this is quite trivial , so there is n't much explanation needed . A logical reasoning for this is that you can make two triangles by dropping an altitude for which both halves are each rotated 180 degrees about their hypotenuse 's mid-point to form two rectangles . Thus it is clear that the triangles are one half the area of their respective rectangles which have a total area of ( bh . ) <h> What is the area of the triangle pictured below ? <p> Since the triangle has a base of 5 and a height of 8 , the area is ( frac12 cdot 5 cdot 8 = 20 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the base and height are perpendicular .

( square ) <p> image <p> So you thought that the area @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it turns out that there are many more ways to derive the area of a triangle than that . <h> Using Sine Rule <p> Consider the following triangle with angles ( A , B ) , and ( C ) and corresponding opposite sides ( a , b ) , and ( c ) : <p> Then the area of triangle ( ABC ) is ( textArea ) =frac12 absin C = frac12 bcsin A = frac12 acsin B = fracabc4R , where ( R ) is the radius of the circumcircle of triangle ( ABC. ) ( square ) <p> We will prove the area is equal to ( frac12 bc sin A ) . The other equalities can be proved similarly . <p> By drawing the height ( h ) of the triangle from vertex ( C ) to the opposite side , we know that the area of the triangle is ( textArea ) = frac12 ch .

Therefore , ( textArea ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drawing the height ( h ) from the other two vertices , we can similarly show ( textArea ) =frac12 absin C = frac12 acsin B.

Now , keeping that in mind , let 's shift gears a bit . <p> By the Pythagorean theorem , ( b2=h2+m2 ) and ( a2=h2+n2 ) .

@@77511762 @6211762/ <p> In number theory , the prime factorization of a number ( N ) is the set consisting of prime numbers whose product is ( N. ) As an example , the prime factorization of 90 is 90 = 2 times 3 times 3 times 5 . Due to its uniqueness for every positive integer , the prime factorization provides a foundation for elementary number theory . <h> If ( x , y , z ) are three different prime numbers such that ( N=xtimes ytimes z ) , how many positive divisors does ( N ) have excluding ( 1 ) and itself . <p> Since ( N=xtimes ytimes z ) , we can conclude that ( x , y ) and ( z ) are the factors of ( N ) .

We observe that this is still divisible by ( 2 ) , so we once again divide it , obtaining ( 18 ) . We repeat this once more , which leaves us with ( 9 ) . We then realize ( 9 ) is not divisible by ( 2 ) and thus look for the next prime integer that the number is divisible by , which happens to be ( 3 ) . We then divide ( 9 ) by ( 3 ) , which leaves us with ( 3 ) .

Given an artificial neural network and an error function , the method calculates the gradient of the error function with respect to the neural network 's weights . It is a generalization of the delta rule for perceptrons to multilayer feedforward neural networks . <p> The " backwards " part of the name stems from the fact that calculation of the gradient proceeds backwards through the network , with the gradient of the final layer of weights being calculated first and the gradient of the first layer of weights being calculated last . Partial computations of the gradient from one layer are reused in the computation of the gradient for the previous layer . This backwards flow of the error information allows for efficient computation of the gradient at each layer versus the naive approach of calculating the gradient of each layer separately . <p> Backpropagation 's popularity has experienced a recent resurgence given the widespread adoption of deep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is considered an efficient algorithm , and modern implementations take advantage of specialized GPUs to further improve performance . <h> Contents <h> History <p> Backpropagation was invented in the 1970s as a general optimization method for performing automatic differentiation of complex nested functions . However , it was n't until 1986 , with the publishing of a paper by Rumelhart , Hinton , and Williams , titled " Learning Representations by Back-Propagating Errors " , that the importance of the algorithm was appreciated by the machine learning community at large . <p> Researchers had long been interested in finding a way to train multilayer artificial neural networks that could automatically discover good " internal representations " , i.e. features that make learning easier and more accurate . Features can be thought of as the stereotypical input to a specific node that activates that node ( i.e. causes it to output a positive value near ( 1 ) ) . Since a node 's activation is dependent on its incoming weights and bias , researchers say a node has learned a feature if its weights and bias cause that node to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> By the 1980s , hand-engineering features had become the de facto standard in many fields , especially in computer vision , since experts knew from experiments which features ( e.g. lines , circles , edges , blobs in computer vision ) made learning simpler . However , hand-engineering successful features requires a lot of knowledge and practice . More importantly , since it is not automatic , it is usually very slow . <p> Backpropagation was one of the first methods able to demonstrate that artificial neural networks could learn good internal representations , i.e. their hidden layers learned nontrivial features . Experts examining multilayer feedforward networks trained using backpropagation actually found that many nodes learned features similar to those designed by human experts and those found by neuroscientists investigating biological neural networks in mammalian brains ( e.g. certain nodes learned to detect edges , while others computed Gabor filters ) . Even more importantly , because of the efficiency of the algorithm and the fact that domain experts were no longer required to discover appropriate features , backpropagation allowed artificial neural networks to be applied to a much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time and cost constraints . <h> Problem Definition <p> Backpropagation is analogous to calculating the delta rule for a multilayer feedforward network . Thus , like the delta rule , backpropagation requires three things : <p> 1 ) Dataset consisting of input-output pairs ( ( vecxi , vecyi ) ) , where ( vecxi ) is the input and ( vecyi ) is the desired output of the network on input ( vecxi ) . The set of input-output pairs of size ( N ) is denoted ( X = ( vecx1 , vecy1 ) , dots , ( vecxN , vecyN ) ) . <p> 2 ) A feedforward neural network , as formally defined in the article concerning feedforward neural networks , whose parameters are collectively denoted ( theta ) . In backpropagation , the parameters of primary interest are ( wijk ) , the weight between node ( j ) in layer ( lk ) and node ( i ) in layer ( lk-1 ) , and ( bik ) , the bias for node ( i ) in layer ( lk ) . There are no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fully connected . <p> 3 ) An error function , ( E ( X , theta ) ) , which defines the error between the desired output ( vecyi ) and the calculated output ( hatvecyi ) of the neural network on input ( vecxi ) for a set of input-output pairs ( ( vecxi , vecyi ) in X ) and a particular value of the parameters ( theta ) . <p> Training a neural network with gradient descent requires the calculation of the gradient of the error function ( E ( X , theta ) ) with respect to the weights ( wijk ) and biases ( bik ) . Then , according to the learning rate ( alpha ) , each iteration of gradient descent updates the weights and biases ( collectively denoted ( theta ) according to : <p> where ( thetat ) denotes the parameters of the neural network at iteration ( t ) in gradient descent . <h> What 's the Target ? <p> As mentioned in the previous section , one major problem in training multilayer feedforward neural networks is in deciding how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and biases for hidden layer nodes should be . Unlike the perceptron , which has the delta rule for approximating a well defined target output , hidden layer nodes do n't have a target output since they are used as intermediate steps in the computation . <p> Since hidden layer nodes have no target output , one ca n't simply define an error function that is specific to that node . Instead , any error function for that node will be dependent on the values of the parameters in the previous layers ( since previous layers determine the input for that node ) and following layers ( since the output of that node will affect the computation of the error function ( E ( X , theta ) ) ) . This coupling of parameters between layers can make the math quite messy ( primarily as a result of using the product rule , discussed below ) , and if not implemented cleverly , can make the final gradient descent calculations slow . Backpropagation addresses both of these issues by simplifying the mathematics of gradient descent , while also facilitating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ below is for a neural network with one output , but the algorithm can be applied to a network with any number of outputs by consistent application of the chain rule and power rule . Thus , for all the following examples , input-output pairs will be of the form ( ( vecx , y ) ) , i.e. the target value ( y ) is not a vector . <p> where ( yi ) is the target value for input-output pair ( ( vecxi , yi ) ) and ( hatyi ) is the computed output of the network on input ( vecxi ) . Again , other error functions can be used , but the mean squared error 's historical association with backpropagation and its convenient mathematical properties make it a good choice for learning the method . <h> Deriving the Gradients <p> The derivation of the backpropagation algorithm is fairly straightforward . It follows from use of the chain rule and product rule in differential calculus . Application of these rules is dependent on the differentiation of the activation function , one of the reasons the heaviside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , non differentiable ) . <h> Preliminaries <p> For the rest of this section , the derivative of a function ( f(x) ) will be denoted ( fprime(x) ) , so that the sigmoid function 's derivative is ( sigmaprime(x) ) . <p> To simplify the mathematics further , the bias ( bik ) for node ( i ) in layer ( k ) will be incorporated into the weights as ( w0ik ) with a fixed output of ( o0k-1 = 1 ) for node ( 0 ) in layer ( k-1 ) . Thus , <p> by calculating , for each weight ( wijk ) the value of ( fracpartial Epartial wijk ) . Since the error function can be decomposed into a sum over individual error terms for each individual input-output pair , the derivative can be calculated with respect to each input-output pair individually and then combined at the end ( since the derivative of a sum of functions is the sum of the derivatives of each function ) . <p> Thus , for the purposes of derivation , the backpropagation algorithm will concern itself with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the general form for all input-output pairs in ( X ) can be generated by combining the individual gradients . Thus , the error function in question for derivation is <p> E = frac12left ( haty - yright ) 2 <p> where the subscript ( d ) in ( Ed ) , ( hatyd ) , and ( yd ) are omitted for simplification . <h> Error Function Derivatives <p> The derivation of the backpropagation algorithm begins by applying the chain rule to the error function partial derivative <p> where ( ajk ) is the activation ( product-sum plus bias ) of node ( j ) in layer ( k ) before it is passed to the nonlinear activation function ( in this case , the sigmoid function ) to generate the output . This decomposition of the partial derivative basically says that the change in the error function due to a weight is a product of the change in the error function ( E ) due to the activation for that weight ( ajk ) times the change in the activation ( ajk ) due to the weight ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the error , for reasons discussed below . It is denoted <p> deltajk equiv fracpartial Epartial ajk <p> The second term can be calculated from the equation for ( ajk ) above <p> Thus , the partial derivative of the error function ( E ) with respect to a weight ( wijk ) is <p> fracpartial Epartial wijk = deltajk oik-1 <p> Thus , the partial derivative of a weight is a product of the error term ( deltajk ) at node ( j ) in layer ( k ) , and the output ( oik-1 ) of node ( i ) in layer ( k-1 ) . This makes intuitive sense since the weight ( wijk ) connects the output of node ( i ) in layer ( k ) to the input of node ( j ) in layer ( k ) in the computation graph . <p> It is important to note that the above partial derivatives have all been calculated without any consideration of a particular error function or activation function . However , since the error term ( deltajk ) still needs to be calculated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , at this point it is necessary to introduce specific functions for both of these . As mentioned previously , classic backpropagation uses the mean squared error function ( which is the squared error function for the single input-output pair case ) and the sigmoid activation function . <p> The calculation of the error ( deltajk ) will be shown to be dependent on the values of error terms in the next layer . Thus , computation of the error terms will proceed backwards from the output layer down to the input layer . This is where backpropagation , or backwards propagation of errors , gets its name . <h> The Output Layer <p> Starting from the final layer , backpropagation attempts to define the value ( delta1m ) , where ( m ) is the final layer ( the subscript is ( 1 ) and not ( j ) because this derivation concerns a one output neural network , so there is only one output node ( j = 1 ) ) . For example , a four layer neural network will have ( m=3 ) for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last layer , and so on . Expressing the error function ( E ) in terms of the value ( a1m ) ( since ( delta1m ) is a partial derivative with respect to ( a1m ) ) gives <h> The Hidden Layers <p> Now the question arises of how to calculate the partial derivatives of layers other than the output layer . Luckily , the chain rule for multivariate functions comes to the rescue again . Observe the following equation for the error term ( deltajk ) in layer ( 1 le k le m ) <p> where ( l ) ranges from ( 1 ) to ( rk+1 ) ( the number of nodes in the next layer ) . Note that , because the bias input ( o0k ) corresponding to ( w0jk+1 ) is fixed , its value is not dependent on the outputs of previous layers , and thus , ( l ) does not take on the value ( 0 ) . <p> Plugging in the error term ( deltalk+1 ) gives the following equation <h> Backpropagation as Backwards Computation <p> This equation is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( deltajk ) at layer ( k ) is dependent on the errors ( deltakk+1 ) at the next layer ( k+1 ) . Thus , errors flow backward , from the last layer to the first layer . All that is needed is to compute the first error terms based on the computed output ( haty = go(a1m) ) and target output ( y ) . Then , the error terms for the previous layer are computed by performing a product sum ( weighted by ( wjlk+1 ) ) of the error terms for the next layer and scaling it by ( gprime(ajk) ) , repeated until the input layer is reached . <p> This backwards propagation of errors is very similar to the forward computation that calculates the neural network 's output . Thus , calculating the output is often called the forward phase while calculating the error terms and derivatives is often called the backward phase . While going in the forward direction , the inputs are repeatedly recombined from the first layer to the last by product sums dependent on the weights ( wijk ) and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go(x) ) . In the backward direction , the " inputs " are the final layer 's error terms , which are repeatedly recombined from the last layer to the first by product sums dependent on the weights ( wjlk+1 ) and transformed by nonlinear scaling factors ( goprime(ajm) ) and ( gprime(ajk) ) . <p> Furthermore , because the computations for backwards phase are dependent on the activations ( ajk ) and outputs ( ojk ) of the nodes in the previous ( the non-error term for all layers ) and next layer ( the error term for hidden layers ) , all of these values must be computed before the backwards phase can commence . Thus , the forward phase precedes the backward phase for every iteration of gradient descent . In the forward phase , activations ( ajk ) and outputs ( ojk ) will be remembered for use in the backwards phase . Once the backwards phase is completed and the partial derivatives are known , the weights ( and associated biases ( bjk = w0jk ) ) can be updated by gradient descent . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ convergence criterion is met . <h> The Backpropagation Algorithm <p> Using the terms defined in the section titled Formal Definition and the equations derived in the section titled Deriving the Gradients , the backpropagation algorithm is dependent on the following five equations <h> The General Algorithm <p> The backpropagation algorithm proceeds in the following steps , assuming a suitable learning rate ( alpha ) and random initialization of the parameters ( wijk ) <p> 1 ) Calculate the forward phase for each input-output pair ( ( vecxd , yd ) ) and store the results ( hatyd ) , ( ajk ) , and ( ojk ) for each node ( j ) in layer ( k ) by proceeding from layer ( 0 ) , the input layer , to layer ( m ) , the output layer . <p> 2 ) Calculate the backward phase for each input-output pair ( ( vecxd , yd ) ) and store the results ( fracpartial Edpartial wijk ) for each weight ( wijk ) connecting node ( i ) in layer ( k-1 ) to node ( j ) in layer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the output layer , to layer ( 1 ) the input layer . <p> ( quadquad ) a ) Evaluate the error term for the final layer ( delta1m ) by using the second equation . <p> ( quadquad ) b ) Backpropagate the error terms for the hidden layers ( deltajk ) , working backwards from the final hidden layer ( k = m-1 ) , by repeatedly using the third equation . <p> ( quadquad ) c ) Evaluate the partial derivatives of the individual error ( Ed ) with respect to ( wijk ) by using the first equation . <p> 3 ) Combine the individual gradients for each input-output pair ( fracpartial Edpartial wijk ) to get the total gradient ( fracpartial E ( X , theta ) partial wijk ) for the entire set of input-output pairs ( X = ( vecx1 , y1 ) , dots , ( vecxN , yN ) ) by using the fourth equation ( a simple average of the individual gradients ) . <p> 4 ) Update the weights according to the learning rate ( alpha ) and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ partial wijk ) by using the fifth equation ( moving in the direction of the negative gradient ) . <h> Backpropagation In Sigmoidal Neural Networks <p> The classic backpropagation algorithm was designed for regression problems with sigmoidal activation units . While backpropagation can be applied to classification problems as well as networks with non-sigmoidal activation functions , the sigmoid function has convenient mathematical properties which , when combined with an appropriate output activation function , greatly simplify the algorithm 's understanding . Thus , in the classic formulation , the activation function for hidden nodes is sigmoidal ( ( g(x) = sigma(x) ) ) and the output activation function is the identity function ( ( go(x) = x ) ) ( the network output is just a weighted sum of its hidden layer , i.e. the activation ) . <p> Backpropagation is actually a major motivating factor in the historical use of sigmoid activation functions due to its convenient derivative , <p> Thus , using these two activation functions removes the need to remember the activation values ( a1m ) and ( ajk ) in addition to the output values @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the memory footprint of the algorithm . This is because the derivative for the sigmoid activation function in the backwards phase only needs to recall the output of that function in the forward phase , and is not dependent on the actual activation value , which is the case in the more general formulation of backpropagation where ( gprime(ajk) ) must be calculated . Similarly , the derivative for the identity activation function does n't depend on anything since it is a constant . <p> Thus , for a feedforward neural network with sigmoidal hidden units and an identity output unit , the error term equations are <h> Code Example <p> The following code example is for a sigmoidal neural network as described in the previous subsection . It has one hidden layer and one output node in the output layer . The code is written in Python3 and makes heavy use of the NumPy library for performing matrix math . Because the calculations of the gradient for individual input-output pairs ( ( vecxd , yd ) ) can be done in parallel , and many calculations are based on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a natural way to represent the input data , output data , and layer weights . NumPy 's efficient computation of matrix products and the ability to use modern GPUs ( which are optimized for matrix operations ) can give significant speedups in both the forward and backward phases of computation . <p> importnumpyasnp# define the sigmoid LONG ... choose a random seed for reproducible **25;903;TOOLONG learning ratealpha=.1# number of nodes in the hidden layernumhidden=3# LONG ... outputs# x.T is the transpose of x , making this a column **32;930;TOOLONG initialize weights randomly with mean 0 and range -1 , 1# the +1 in the 1st dimension of the weight matrices is for the bias LONG ... number of iterations of gradient **27;964;TOOLONG for each iteration of gradient **33;993;TOOLONG : # forward phase# np.hstack ( ( np.ones ( ... ) , X ) adds a fixed input of 1 for the bias LONG ... backward phase# output layer error **37;1028;TOOLONG hidden layer error term# : , 1 : removes the bias term from the LONG ... partial LONG ... average for total LONG ... update LONG ... print the final @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Output After Training : n " . **26;1067;TOOLONG ) <p> The matrix X is the set of inputs ( vecx ) and the matrix y is the set of outputs ( y ) . The number of nodes in the hidden layer can be customized by setting the value of the variable numhidden . The learning rate ( alpha ) is controlled by the variable alpha . The number of iterations of gradient descent is controlled by the variable numiterations . <p> By changing these variables and comparing the output of the program to the target values y , one can see how these variables control how well backpropagation can learn the dataset X and y .

However , using too large or too small a learning rate can cause the model to diverge or converge too slowly , respectively .

Thus , the average kinetic energy of the gas particles increases as the gas becomes warmer . Because the mass of these particles is constant , their kinetic energy can only increase if the average velocity of the particles increases .

On extrapolating , the graph will hit -273.15 degrees . <h> Boyle 's Law <p> Gases can be compressed because most of the volume of a gas is empty space . If we compress a gas without changing its temperature , the average kinetic energy of the gas particles stays the same . There is no change in the speed with which the particles move , but the container is smaller . Thus , the particles travel from one end of the container to the other in a shorter period of time .

@@77511786 @6211786/ 26449 @qwx646449 <p> Newton 's laws of motion are the foundation on which all of classical mechanics is built . Everything from celestial mechanics , to rotational motion , to the ideal gas law can be explained by the powerful principles that Newton wrote down . The main difficulty in applying the Newtonian algorithm is in identifying all the forces between objects , which requires some ingenuity . This all stems from the fact that Newton 's laws are written in terms of vector quantities that are easiest to use in Cartesian coordinates . One can of course rewrite a vector in any system of coordinates , but it is not the most transparent operation . We also need an insightful choice of coordinate system to simplify all our calculations . Moreover , choosing the wrong reference frame can give rise to confusing artifacts . <p> The late , great Joseph Louis Lagrange . <p> The scheme would be more useful if our important quantities could be easily re-written and solved in the most convenient coordinate system . What we imagine is the ability to describe our systems in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to write down numbers like mass , energy , or momentum squared which are invariant under a change in coordinates . Such is the aim of the Lagrangian formulation of mechanics . <p> Let 's begin by reviewing some hard problems of Newtonian mechanics and pointing out what makes them so difficult to resolve . <h> Hard problems for the Newtonian algorithm <p> Without making an attempt at solution , we point out some challenging problems for Newton 's approach . <p> Mass on a sliding wedge <p> Consider the block-shaped mass on a sliding wedge below . Both the block and the wedge are free to move without friction under the force of gravity . Setting this problem up is difficult for two reasons . The first is that the mass ( M ) moves along the floor while ( m ) moves at an angle , which creates a tension in the choice of coordinates ( the Cartesian grid in the frame of the ground , and another in the frame of the tilted surface ) . The second is that the normal force between ( M @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( M ) and ( m ) . <p> Bead on a spinning hoop <p> We might also consider a bead that is free to slide on a rotating hoop . This situation does not easily yield to a vector description because gravity beckons us to use Cartesian coordinates , while the constraint of the hoop begs that we use polar coordinates . Finding a representation that is at once easy to think about , and straightforward to calculate in , is no easy task . <p> Coupled pendulums <p> As a final example , consider the coupled pendulum , where one pendulum hangs from the end of another . This scenario is plagued by the choice of convenient coordinates , the coupling of the two pendulums , and the constraint that keeps the two pendulums from breaking apart . <h> Complaints about Newtonian mechanics <p> Each of these problems would be extremely difficult to resolve by the usual approach of identifying forces , writing down constraints , transforming to a convenient system of coordinates , and possibly uncoupling equations by clever substitutions . Let us outline these difficulties explicitly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ representation : Representing a system using vectors cripples us when we need to change coordinate systems . For example , though it is easy to write down the force of gravity as ( -ghatz ) in a Cartesian coordinate system , it is most natural to represent the motion of a pendulum in terms of the angle ( theta ) of the swing . Rewriting the acceleration vector of the pendulum bob ( ddotvecr ) is tedious and requires special knowledge of the transformation properties of the radial and directional unit vectors . In more involved problems , this only becomes more of a hindrance . Contrast this to the ease with which we can transform scalar quantities such as the kinetic energy ( textrmK.E. =frac12 m v2 rightarrow frac12 m omega2 r +frac12 m dotr2 ) . Thus , we would benefit from a mechanics freed from vector quantities . <p> Identifying forces : In using Newton 's laws , we must account for all forces as well as their counter forces . In systems with more than one particle , this can become paralyzing as the set of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We should hope for a mechanics where this bookkeeping does not keep us from analyzing problems of interest . Thus , if we can find a way to free ourselves from the chains of vector forces , we should be able to reason about more complex systems . <p> Constraints : In Newtonian mechanics , we must explicitly build constraints into the equations of motion . For example , a mass on an inclined plane must abide the surface of the plane , and this must be treated by introducing a normal force representing the constraint of the surface . This can quickly become very complicated , especially when constraints are imposed by non-rigid surfaces like in the first example above . It would make our task much easier if constraints could be imposed implicitly , for instance in our choice of coordinates . <h> Newtonian mechanics : The elevator pitch <p> We now remind ourselves of the principles of Newtonian mechanics , and suggest a formulation that will aid us in our effort to reshape mechanics in an energy based , vector free manner . Newton 's second law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the net force upon the particle , where the acceleration and net force are both vectors in one , two , or three dimensions : <p> vecFtextnet = mveca . <p> We recall the work-energy principle which states that the work done by the net force ( i.e. the non-constraint forces ) on a particle is equal to the increase in kinetic energy of the particle . We neglect constraint forces because they always act perpendicular to the direction of motion , and thus perform no work on systems . <p> Consider an arbitrary , infinitesimal displacement ( deltavecr ) of the position of our particle under the net force . We can say ( vecFcdot deltavecr = mvecacdotdeltavecr ) . If we integrate along a finite displacement , we find that <p> This statement is known as d'Alembert 's principle , and is the jumpoff point for our efforts . <p> We now proceed with a reformulation of Newtonian mechanics that eliminates the complaints that we outlined in our wish list . <h> Throwing out forces <p> Our first desire is to exchange vector forces for scalar energies . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ written as the spatial derivative of a potential function , i.e. <p> Fi = -fracpartial V ( r1 , ldots , rn ) partial ri . <p> At the lowest level ( i.e. particle interactions ) all forces are conservative , but in macroscopic perspectives conservative forces between particles are often approximated by dissipative forces like contact friction or viscosity . For now , let us proceed with conservative forces , and worry about how to accomodate dissipative kludges later . Our first step is to rewrite Newton 's second law ( vecF = mddotvecr ) as <h> Kicking out vectors , bringing in energy <p> We have thus dispensed with forces by relating the spatial derivatives of the potential energy to the acceleration vector . However , we are still dealing in vectors . Our next objective is to eliminate our dependence upon using vector quantities to represent positions and velocities . Concretely , we would like to rid ourselves of any terms containing derivatives of position vectors and replace them with derivatives of scalar quantities like energy . <p> where we have applied the identity ( left(xyright)prime = @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we have an equation for the vector ( vecr ) that makes no reference to a particular choice of coordinates ( Cartesian , spherical , etc ) . We now expand the RHS in a coordinate basis ( r1 , ldots , rn : ) <p> Now , remember that the small displacement ( delta vecr ) was arbitrary . In three dimensions , we could have ( deltavecr = langle deltax , 0 , deltaz rangle ) or ( langle 0 , 0 , deltaz rangle ) . But the equation must be true independent of the displacement , i.e. every term in the sum is equal to zero independent of the coordinate displacements ( delta rk . ) Therefore , we have <p> Now , for conservative forces , ( V ) is a pure function of the position variables , so that ( displaystylefracpartial Vpartial dotrk=0 ) . We can therefore move ( V ) into the derivative and write <p> We have thus completely eliminated the use of position and velocity vectors from classical mechanics . If we agree to call the difference between the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we can shorten our equation to <p> The quantity ( T-V ) is called the Lagrangian of the system , and the equation for ( L ) is called the Euler equation . In any problem of interest , we obtain the equations of motion in a straightforward manner by evaluating the Euler equation for each variable . For example , in a spherical coordinate system , we would have three Euler equations for ( r , theta ) , and ( phi ) . <p> The Lagrangian , ( L ) , of a system is the difference of the kinetic energy ( T ) , and the potential energy ( V : ) <p> L ( r , dotr ) equiv T ( r , dotr ) - U(r) . <h> Implicit constraints <p> Our last aim was to eliminate the explicit inclusion of constraint forces . Perhaps it wo n't be so surprising that having eliminated forces , we 've eliminated constraint forces as well . In fact , they were tossed out at the introduction of d'Alembert 's principle . In the Lagrangian formulation , constraints @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the simplest . <p> When we eliminated vectors in favor of coordinates , an important fact went unmentioned . Not only did we eliminate vectors , but we restated mechanics in terms of generalized coordinates , i.e. we are free to choose any coordinate system whatsoever that is most natural to describe our system . For example , if a particle is constrained to move on the surface of a sphere , we can use a spherical coordinate system where ( r ) is held constant . Thus , we include constraints intrinsically by our choice of coordinates ! <h> Some solved problems <p> This is all a bit abstract . Let 's apply the Lagrangian formulation to a few problems and develop a concrete feeling for what we 've done . <p> Mass on an inclined plane <p> The mass slides down the inclined plane so we can choose our coordinate to be the distance along the plane ( s ) . In this coordinate system , the kinetic energy of the mass is given by ( T=frac12 m dots2 ) . If we define the initial potential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a function of ( s ) is given by ( V=-mgssintheta ) , where ( theta ) is the angle of the incline . <p> Thus our Lagrangian is given by <p> L = frac12 m dots2 - mgssintheta . <p> As ( s ) is the only variable coordinate in this problem , we have one Euler equation to evaluate , which we now do <p> which is the equation of motion we expect for the mass on an inclined plane . Notice that our solution required almost no thought . As soon we we write down the kinetic and potential energies , the solution amounts to taking some mindless derivatives . <p> Celestial mechanics <p> Let 's suppose that we have a star of mass ( M ) and a planet whose mass ( m ) is much less than that of the star . The planet and star interact through the gravitational potential ( V(r) = -GfracMmr , ) where ( r ) is the distance separating the star and planet . What are the equations of motion ? <p> Given the symmetry of the problem , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with ( r ) being the distance between the star and the planet , and ( theta ) the angle of our planet around its orbit . <p> The kinetic energy of the planet is given by ( T = frac12 m dotr2 + frac12 m left(rdotthetaright)2 ) . <p> The Euler equation for ( theta ) tells us something remarkable . It says that the quantity in parentheses , the angular momentum of the planet , is a constant of the motion . <p> Notice that we did n't need to know anything about torque , or angular momentum , but we just got it for free as a result of our Euler equation . Compare our Lagrangian approach to the solution using the Newtonian algorithm in deriving Kepler 's laws . <p> The instance example of finding a conserved quantity from our Euler equation is no happy accident . It is an example of a general feature of Lagrangian mechanics . Before stating the general connection between the form of a Lagrangian and the conserved quantities of motion , we 'll make a further observation about our Lagrangian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Cartesian coordinates , the kinetic energy is given by ( T = frac12 m dotr2 ) . Since potentials are functions of position , the velocity ( dotr ) will only ever appear in the kinetic energy term . Thus , the quantity ( fracpartial Lpartial dotr ) in the Euler equation will always be equal to ( mdotr ) . However , this is just the momentum of the particle . Thus , we can say that ( pr = fracpartial Lpartial dotr ) , i.e. the momentum of the particle is just the derivative of the Lagrangian with respect to the velocity . <p> Thus , we can rewrite the Euler equation as <p> fracddtpr = fracpartial Vpartial r . <p> Notice also , in the orbital mechanics example , that the second Euler equation produced ( fracpartial Lpartial dottheta = mr2dottheta ) , the angular momentum of the particle . Thus , we have ( ptheta = fracpartial Lpartial dottheta ) , just as we had for linear momentum above . <p> In fact , it is generally the case that the partial derivative of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the generalized momentum associated with that variable . <p> Thus , we can recast the Lagrangian formulation as <p> dotpi = fracpartial Lpartial ri . <p> We can now state a conservation principle about Lagrangians . <p> Noether 's theorem for momenta <p> If the coordinate ( rk ) does not appear in the Lagrangian of a system , then the corresponding momenta is a conserved quantity . <p> Proof Suppose the coordinate ( rk ) makes no appearances in the Lagrangian , then <p> dotpk = fracpartial Lpartial rk = 0 . <p> Thus , in the example of orbital mechanics , we can see that the Lagrangian makes no reference to the angular variable ( theta ) , and thus the angular momentum does not vary in time . <h> Simple solutions to hard problems in Newtonian mechanics <p> We close the article by revisiting two of the hard problems we posed for Newtonian mechanics at the beginning . It is strongly recommended that you attempt to set those problems up using the Newtonian approach so as to more fully appreciate the power of the Lagrangian formulation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , both the mass and the wedge are free to slide .

It allows us to make predictions about how much the option value would change as volatility changes . <h> When the stock is trading at $45 , the call option on the $45 strike with 25 days to expiry is worth $3.48 at an implied volatility of 62 . If the vega of the option is 0.056 , what would be the price of the option when implied volatility is 70 ? <p> The volatility has increased by ( 70 - 62 = 8 ) vol points . Since the vega of the option is 0.056 , our best guess of the option value is that it has increased by ( 8 times 0.056 = 0.448 ) .

As volatility increases slightly , but not sufficiently enough to affect the payoff which is far away , there would be little change in the extrinsic value and thus a low vega . After a while when the stock is volatile enough to result in a payoff , then the extrinsic value would start to increase and so vega becomes larger . <p> Of course , the further away an option is from ATM , the higher the volatility will have to be before this effect takes place .

A nonzero amount of the wavefunction transmits through the barrier 1 . <p> To illustrate the concept of tunneling , consider trying to confine an electron in a box .

The relevant model is called the Gamow model after its creator George Gamow 4 . Gamow modeled the potential experienced by an alpha particle in the nucleus as a finite square well in the nuclear region and Coulombic repulsion outside the nucleus , as displayed in the diagram : <p> An alpha particle at energy indicated by the red line , confined in Gamow 's potential .

It works by running an extremely sharp tip of only a single atom thick over the surface of the material , with the tip at a higher voltage than the material . This voltage allows a non-negligible tunneling current to flow from electrons that tunnel from the surface of the material , through the potential barrier represented by the air , to the tip of the microscope , completing a circuit . By measuring the amount of current that flows at a given distance , the microscope can resolve where the atoms are on the surface of the material . <p> Tunnel Diodes <p> In a tunnel diode , two p-type and n-type semiconductors are separated by a thin insulating region called the depletion region . Recall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with impurity atoms that carry one less valence electron , while an n-type semiconductor has been doped with impurities carrying one more valence electron ; both allow conduction to occur more easily due to the extra electrons or " holes " provided by the dopant . In the depletion region , there are no conduction electrons ; the electron have been depleted to other regions . The main effect of a tunnel diode is that an applied voltage can make electrons from the n-type semiconductor tunnel through the depletion region , causing a unidirectional current towards the p-type semiconductor at low voltages . As voltage increases , the current drops as the depletion region widens , and then increases again at high voltages to function as a normal diode . The ability of tunnel diodes to direct current at low voltages due to tunneling allows them to operate at very high AC frequencies . <p> Josephson Junctions <p> Some semiconducting materials are superconductors , meaning that in certain temperature ranges a current can flow indefinitely without resistive heating occurring .

Similarly , we can take any of the ( n2 ! ) permutations of the ( n2 ) identical objects of type 2 and obtain the same arrangement . Continuing this argument , we account for these repeated arrangements by dividing by the number of repetitions . This gives the following result for the total number of permutations : <p> In the case all objects are distinct , we have ( n1 = n2 = ldots = nd = 1 ) , and the above theorem shows that the number of permutations is fracn ! n1 ! n2 ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cdots 1 ! = n ! , which we have seen in Permutations without Repetition . Note that we have assumed that the permutation contains all of the objects in the ordering . In the case that we would only like to include some of the objects in the ordering , see Permutations with Restriction . <h> Basic Examples <h> In the worked examples of Permutations without Repetition , we saw that if Lisa has ( n ) different ornaments , then she can arrange them in ( n ! ) different ways on her mantle . What happens if Lisa instead has some ornaments that are identical ? How many ways can Lisa arrange ornaments on her mantle if she has 2 identical cat ornaments , 3 identical dog ornaments , 1 rabbit , 1 penguin , and 1 koala ornament ? <p> In total , there are 8 objects , and if the objects were considered to be distinct , there are ( 8 ! ) ways to arrange them on the mantle . For any arrangement , we can take any of the ( 2 ! ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Similarly , we can take any of the ( 3 ! ) permutations of dog ornaments and obtain the same arrangement . Thus , to account for these repeated arrangements , we divide by the number of repetitions to obtain that the total number of permutations is ( frac8 ! 3 ! 2 ! ) . ( square ) <h> How many ways can the letters in the name RAMONA be arranged ? <p> Observe that the letter A appears twice and all other letters appear once in the word . If we treat the A 's as distinct from each other ( say ( A1 ) and ( A2 ) ) , then there are ( 6 ! = 720 ) ways to rearrange the letters . However , since the letters are the same , we have to divide by ( 2 ! ) to obtain ( frac 7202 ! = 360 ) ways ..

If the census turns out to be difficult , it may be worth making different choices for shape type . Many figures display some degree of symmetry that makes the census straightforward . <p> Throughout the process , it helps to stay as organized as possible . Position , size , and orientation are three common ways to organize cases . For example , one might count all of the " side-length-1 equilateral triangles , " then all of the " side-length-2 equilateral triangles , " and so on . Alternatively , one might count the triangles by location , first starting with " all of the triangles that have a corner at the very top of the figure , " then " all of the triangles that have their highest corner at the second level of the figure , " and so on . <p> To illustrate these principles in action , consider a slightly trickier example consisting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The first step is to go through the figure and consider the distinct types of triangles formed .

Since there are five inner vertices , there must be ( 4 cdot 5 = 20 ) triangles that consist of two outer vertices and one inner vertex . <p> Finally , it holds that each pair of two inner vertices forms only one triangle with one of the outer vertices , of which there are a total of ( 5 ) . <p> Although there were certainly few enough triangles that a crude attempt to enumerate all distinct shapes would have worked , relying on systematic counting of some of the cases ( e.g. , the triangles formed by three outer vertices ) and symmetry arguments to reduce the number of cases that needed to be counted simplified @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and organization are often the keys to accuracy . <p> How many triangles can you find in this picture ? <p> 27 21 30 36 <p> How many triangles can you find in this figure ? <p> 38 10 16 24 <h> Further Examples <p> How many circular arcs are there in the figure above ? <p> ( ) Clarifications : <p> A circular arc is a segment between any two points of intersection on a circle set by other circle(s) . <p> An arc is to be counted irrespective of whether it is major or minor . <p> This pattern has 6 levels of triangles .

@@77511798 @6211798/ <h> Quiz 26449 @qwx646449 <p> The binomial distribution is , in essence , the probability distribution of the number of heads resulting from flipping a weighted coin multiple times . It is useful for analyzing the results of repeated independent trials , especially the probability of meeting a particular threshold given a specific error rate , and thus has applications to risk management . For this reason , the binomial distribution is also important in determining statistical significance . <h> Contents <h> Formal Definition <p> A Bernoulli trial , or Bernoulli experiment , is an experiment satisfying two key properties : <p> There are exactly two complementary outcomes , success and failure . <p> The probability of success is the same every time the experiment is repeated . <p> A binomial experiment is a series of ( n ) Bernoulli trials , whose outcomes are independent of each other . A random variable , ( X ) , is defined as the number of successes in a binomial experiment . Finally , a binomial distribution is the probability distribution of ( X ) . <p> For example , consider @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bernoulli trial , since there are exactly two complementary outcomes ( flipping a head and flipping a tail ) , and they are both ( frac12 ) no matter how many times the coin is flipped .

The binomial distribution of this experiment is the probability distribution of ( X. ) <h> Finding the Binomial Distribution <p> Determining the binomial distribution is straightforward but computationally tedious . If there are ( n ) Bernoulli trials , and each trial has a probability ( p ) of success , then the probability of exactly ( k ) successes is <p> binomnkpk(1-p)n-k . <p> This is written as ( textPr(X=k) ) , denoting the probability that the random variable ( X ) is equal to ( k ) , or as ( b ( k ; n , p ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) and ( p ) . <p> The above formula is derived from choosing exactly ( k ) of the ( n ) trials to result in successes , for which there are ( binomnk ) choices , then accounting for the fact that each of the trials marked for success has a probability ( p ) of resulting in success , and each of the trials marked for failure has a probability ( 1-p ) of resulting in failure . The binomial coefficient ( binomnk ) lends its name to the binomial distribution . <p> Consider a weighted coin that flips heads with probability ( 0.25 ) . If the coin is flipped 5 times , what is the resulting binomial distribution ? <p> This binomial experiment consists of 5 trials , a ( p ) -value of ( 0.25 ) , and the number of successes is either 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , or 5 .

In other words , it is used to show that the given data is unlikely under the assumption of fairness , so that the assumption is likely false . <h> A coin is flipped 100 times , and the results are 61 heads and 39 tails .

@@77511800 @6211800/ 26449 @qwx646449 <p> Some of the great tools in physics are so-called " conservation laws " that buttress the laws of motion with certain quantities that remain the same throughout time . Among these great laws is the conservation of energy which states that while energy can change forms , it can not be created or destroyed . <p> Here we 'll explore the partition between kinetic energy and potential energy , and how energy can in some sense replace forces in our calculations . We conclude with the introduction of formal methods of physics that analyze the dynamic behavior of systems solely in terms of energy , thus replacing the necessity of having to analyze forces at all . Such methods play a dominant role in systems of condensed matter , quantum field theory , and other problems far beyond elementary classical mechanics . <h> The conservation of kinetic energy <p> For a person riding a bicycle , their kinetic energy ( E ) is equal to the amount of heat that would be dissipated from the moment they pull the brake , to the moment they come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this heat will go into heating the brake pad and the metal rim of the wheel . If they do skid , most of the heat will go to the rubber in the tire and to the road . Before they pull the break , this energy can be observed as the ongoing motion of the parts of the bicycle , i.e. the net forward movement of the bicycle , and the spinning of the wheels . <p> There are other forms of energy that a particle can have such as gravitational potential energy , chemical potential energy , electrical potential energy , spring potential energy , et cetera , but the kinetic energy is the portion of an object 's energy that is due explicitly to its ongoing motion . For a point particle of mass ( delta m ) , moving at speed ( v ) , the kinetic energy is given by the formula ( frac12 delta mv2 ) , and the kinetic energy of any extended object can be built up from this . If a moving object collides with another object , and there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , no chemical bonds are rearranged , etc. ) then the total kinetic energy of the objects after the collision must equal the kinetic energy of the moving object before the collision . <p> In Isaac Newton 's Principia Mathematica , momentum is defined and is said to be conserved , but there is no mention of energy anywhere in his treatise . Newton was able to work out the elliptical orbits of planets without any reference to energy at all . However , if we start with the assumption that momentum is conserved , we can derive the conservation of kinetic energy , and thus obtain the structure that lay hidden from Newton in his own theory . <p> Colliding balls on a table <p> Consider a ball of mass ( m1 ) moving with velocity ( v0 ) in the direction of a stationary ball of mass ( m2 ) . Let the velocities of the balls after the collision be ( va ) and ( vb , ) respectively . Moreover , suppose the collision is elastic , i.e. the relative velocity of approach is equal and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dfracDelta viDelta vf = -1 ) . <p> Using the values of ( va ) and ( vb ) from above we find ( after some tedious algebra ) <p> textrmKE initial = textrmKE final . <p> Hence , the total kinetic energy is conserved in elastic collisions . <p> What about during the collision ? Imagine we have two identical balls speeding with equal but opposite velocities to a collision . For an instant , neither ball is moving . So where did the kinetic energy of the balls go during this instant ? <p> The collision of the balls is not instantaneous . For a short interval , the kinetic energy of the balls is stored as elastic potential energy , after which it is reallocated to restore the original kinetic energy of the balls . Elastic energy is the potential energy stored in a deformed body , as for example with the compression of an elastic spring . At all times , the combined kinetic and elastic potential energy of the balls is constant . For more information on elastic collisions , see Analyzing elastic collisions . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conservation of energy falls out in elastic collisions . What about when an object is accelerated by a gravitational field ? Without a detailed understanding of potential energy , can we identify quantities that exchange with kinetic energy ? Below , we analyze an especially profitable example of a skier on a frictionless slope . <p> The inclined plane <p> Under constant acceleration , an object travels a distance ( d ) in the time ( t = sqrtdfrac2da ) . For a skier on an inclined plane , this time is given by ( sqrtdfrac2dgsintheta ) . Also , starting from rest at the top of the incline , the skier has speed ( v = at = gsintheta sqrtdfrac2dgsintheta = sqrt2gsintheta d ) at the bottom of the incline . <p> Consider the change in kinetic energy ( dfrac12 mv2 ) . At the top of the incline , this quantity is equal to zero , and at the bottom of the incline it 's equal to ( mgdsintheta ) . We notice that ( mgdsintheta ) is simply the strength of the gravitational force times the vertical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we notice that the quantity ( frac12 mv2 + mg(h0-h) ) is a constant throughout the course of the skier 's motion , i.e. kinetic energy exchanges with the quantity ( mgDelta h ) . <p> Evidently , by falling through the distance ( Delta h ) , the skier has picked up kinetic energy ( textKE = mgDelta h ) . This suggests that ( mgDelta h ) is equal to the gravitational potential energy of the skier , which can reallocate to the kinetic energy , based on the skier 's vertical position . <p> Thus , we have stumbled upon a conservation relation between kinetic energy and the gravitational potential energy . As you might imagine , in this example , the conservation is imposed by the fact that the system follows Newton 's second law ( F = fracdpdt ) . <p> In general , we 'll see that energy conservation holds in countless other scenarios . Further , in all the centuries of careful experimentation , a violation has never been identified ( in macroscopic systems ) . For this reason , the conservation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , i.e. a principle that is expected to hold for all processes in the universe . <h> Work energy theorem <p> In plain english , work means to do something productive . In physics , work is said to be done if force acts to displace an object . For example , when you push a sled across the snow , or lift a bucket of water onto a ledge , or pump up the tire on your bicycle , you 've done work . This idea is captured in the definition of work which is the applied force along the direction of displacement times the displacement . Mathematically , we can write <p> W=int vec Fcdot dvec s = Fscostheta , <p> where ( theta ) is the angle between the force and displacement vectors . <p> As you might imagine , performing work on an object can not only change its displacement , but its kinetic energy as well . We return once more to the example of the skier on the slope to see how these ideas are related . <p> Work on the skier <p> Recall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Now , consider the work ( Fcdot s ) , where ( F ) is the force of gravity along the incline , and ( s ) is the distance traveled along the incline . With ( F = mgsintheta ) and ( s=d ) , we find ( Fcdot s = mgsintheta d ) . <p> This is curious . In descending the slope , we showed that the skier gained an amount of kinetic energy ( mgdsintheta ) which is also equal to the product of the force that acted on the particle , and the distance over which the particle traveled . Moreover , if we were to pull the skier up the slope at constant velocity , he 'd have gained potential energy in the amount ( mgdsintheta ) . One might be tempted to hypothesize that work delivers energy to objects . <p> Indeed , during his descent the gravitational field does work upon the skier to speed him toward Earth , and in pulling him up the hill , we do work against the gravitational field . Work against a field can always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kinetic energy , or in other words potential energy . <p> This suggests that the cumulative pull of the skier by gravity has given rise to the kinetic energy of the particle at the expense of his initial potential energy . Thus , we can either look at the exchange as work done on the skier by the gravitational field , or as a reallocation of potential energy to kinetic energy . <p> This relationship would be quite useful if it holds in general , but as yet , it is just a nice coincidence we 've noticed in our calculation . Next we look to Newton 's laws for a way to put it on firm ground . <p> Newton 's laws : A basis for work <p> According to the second law , we have the following relationship between changes in velocity and a net applied force ( for simplicity we work in one dimension , though the result easily generalizes ) : <p> This relation shows that if the object is traveling with velocity ( v ) and it is pushed through some small distance ( Delta @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it will pick up the additional velocity ( displaystyle Delta v = fracFtextrmnetDelta xmv ) . <p> In three dimensions , our result is ( displaystyle **26;1336;TOOLONG = mvecvcdotDeltavecv ) . <p> This relation provides the basis for what we suspected above , that forces can do work to endow particles with kinetic energy . We can now exploit the relation to prove the work-kinetic energy theorem . <p> Relation between work and kinetic energy <h> Work-kinetic energy theorem <p> The net work ( i.e. work minus work performed against any external fields ) done by the force on an object is equal to its change in kinetic energy : Delta textKE = int vec F cdot dvec s. square <p> Now think about the ways in which you can prove this theorem before you reveal the proof , try proving it yourself , and do n't worry if you were n't able to crack it because most of the people ca n't do it in a single go . <p> Proof 1 : <p> If we add up all of the incremental pushes ( FtextrmnetDelta s ) that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we get ( Ftextrmnetsum Delta s = Ftextrmnetd ) . However , we showed that ( FtextrmnetDelta s = mvDelta v ) , so we have ( Ftextrmnetd = msum vDelta v ) , a sum over the incremental increases in velocity . <p> Let us now perform the sum of the ( mvDelta v ) . To start , when ( v ) is zero , ( mv ) is zero ; at the end , it is equal to ( mvf ) . If we divide the increases up into ( n ) equal pieces , the velocity increases ( Delta v ) are each given by ( dfrac1nvf ) , which we can pull out of the sum so that the sum becomes ( dfracvfnsum v ) . Suppose we divide the velocity increase over many moments so that ( n ) is large and the changes are small . <p> Now , the sum of ( v ) from ( 0 ) to ( vf ) in ( n ) equally sized chunks is simply ( v ) times the average value of ( v ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ act on an object of mass ( m ) with a force ( Ftextrmnet ) over a distance ( d , ) it ends up with a kinetic energy ( dfrac12 mvf2 ) , where the velocity ( vf ) is given by ( sqrt2Ftextrmnetd/m ) . ( square ) <p> Thus , a force acting on an object through a distance transfers energy to the object , and we call this quantity , ( Wtextrmnet = displaystyleint vecFcdot dvecs ) , the work . In a frictionless system , the work is equal to the change in energy caused by the force : Wtextrmnet = Delta textrmKE + Delta textrmPE . More generally , the work is equal to the change in energy plus whatever heat is dissipated to the environment . <h> Work With Potential Energy <p> Potential energy is a form of energy due to the configuration or position of an object in a field . It can be seen as a stored form on kinetic energy in that it can be converted to kinetic energy by allowing an object to relax its position or configuration in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ electric dipole previously restrained at an angle in an electric field , or drop a massive object in a gravitational field , potential energy is converted to movement through relaxation . <p> Dams contain massive amount of water stored at a considerable height . When this water is released , the gravitational potential energy is converted to kinetic energy and the water flows , which in turn spins the turbines to generate electricity which can be stored as electric potential energy in batteries . Thus the water which was stored at a height is used to generate electricity in a time of scarcity . Thus kinetic energy can be captured and stored in various forms of potential energy to be extracted later . <h> Conservation of Kinetic and Potential Energies <p> Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz in 1676-1689 was the first to attempt a definition of kinetic energy , and noticed that for some mechanical systems it seemed to be conserved . But remarkably , it was a French mathematician , Emilie du Chatelet , who was the first to propose and derive the conservation of total kinetic and potential energy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ undertook its translation into French , which she completed in 1749 . During those years of translation , she included her derivation of the conservation law as a supplement to Newton 's treatise . Soon afterwards , mathematicians Leonhard Euler and Joseph-Louis Lagrange went on to develop a mathematical formalism of classical mechanics , based on her works . <p> The Ball <p> In this example , we see the interplay of kinetic and potential energies of a falling ball such that their sum is constant , when air resistance is ignored . <p> Consider a ball of mass ( m ) falling from rest from a height ( H ) above the ground . Initially , since the ball is at rest its kinetic energy and potential energy , respectively , are <p> Let ( v ) be the speed of the ball when it is at height ( h ) above the ground . From the second kinematic equation we have ( v2 = 2g(H-h) ) . Hence , the kinetic energy of the ball at height ( h ) is <p> textrmKEh = dfrac12mv2 = mg(H-h) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ energy at height ( h ) is <p> textrmPEh = mgh . <p> Thus , the sum of energies is ( textrmKEh + textrmPEh = mgH ) , which is the same as the initial sum of energies . <p> Spring With Oscillating Mass <p> When an ideal spring is either compressed or stretched a distance ( x ) from the origin where the spring force ( =0 ) , the potential energy stored in the spring with a spring constant ( k ) ( which comes from using force to compress the spring against the spring force ( F=kx ) ) is <p> PE = dfrac12kx2 , <p> while kinetic energy of the oscillating mass ( m ) moving at velocity ( v ) is <p> KE = dfrac12mv2 , <p> the sum of which is the total energy ( E ) . ( ; ) Since total energy is conserved , ( E ) is a constant over time , so differentiating both sides by time ( t ) , we have <p> which is Hooke 's Law stating that the spring force exerted on mass ( m @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a linear function of the distance from the origin where the force ( = 0 , ) in the direction towards the origin . This can be restated in terms of time ( t ) <p> dfrac m k dfrac d 2 x d t 2 +x =0 , <p> a ( 2textnd ) order differential equation which has the solution , where ( b ) is a constant : <p> Thus , the simple pendulum , for small ( theta ) , has a period ( T ) which is dependent only on ( L ) and ( g : ) <p> T=2pi sqrt dfrac L g . <p> Or more generally , for small ( theta ) but with a rotational inertia of ( I ) <p> T=2pi sqrt dfrac I mgL , <p> where ( L ) is the distance from the pivot to the center of mass of the pendulum . <p> Compare the equations of both spring oscillation and simple pendulum , and see how there 's an analogy of Hooke 's Law in the latter . <h> Conservation of Energy in General <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ realized that thermal heat was another form of energy , capable of mechanical work . By 1850 , the Law of Conservation of Energy was formally stated for the first time , as the First Law of Thermodynamics . In the last decades of the ( 19textth ) century , Ludwig Boltzmann developed the statistical mechanics theory of heat and entropy , showing the equivalence of kinetic and thermal heat energies , based on the theory that matter was made of atoms . Over time , other forms of energy were recognized such as elastic , electromagnetic , chemical and nuclear energy , and the Law of Conservation of Energy was generalized to include all such forms of energy . <p> Firing An Inelastic Shell : <p> A tank fires a special hollow shell that has ( N ) neon atoms inside it , so cold ( somewhere near absolute zero Kelvin ) that relative to the shell the atoms are not moving . The shell has a velocity of ( 680 ) meters per second , and it slams into a dirt wall and suffers a 100% inelastic collision @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But the neon atoms continue to bounce around inside the shell at the same velocity . What is the temperature of the neon gas inside the shell , after the shell has come to a dead stop ? <p> Note that this result does not depend on the number ( N ) of neon atoms so that there could be a gram of neon in the shell , or a single atom of neon . The temperature of an ideal gas depends solely on the mass of the atom and the average velocity of the atoms , is not a form of energy , and does not have the physical dimensions of energy , which thermal heat energy does . <p> The rocket <p> Rocket Physics describes one kind of rocket that uses fuel as a stored form of chemical energy , which is released in the combustion chamber of the rocket to generate the thrust to propel it . As the fuel is used up , the mass of the rocket drops , while its velocity increases . Using the Law of Conservation of Momentum , Velocity of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rocket equation can be derived : <p> beginalign vf &amp;= v0 + ulog fracM0Mf , endalign <p> where ( vf ) and ( Mf ) are the final velocity and mass , respectively , ( v0 ) and ( M0 ) are the initial velocity and mass , respectively , and ( u ) is the velocity of the rocket exhaust relative to the rocket . <p> We can use the Law of Conservation of Energy to derive the same result as follows : <p> Let ( M0-m ) be the rocket 's mass , where ( m ) is the consumed mass of fuel . Also , let ( v(m) ) be the velocity of the rocket as a function of ( m ) , and ( u ) the velocity of the exhaust relative to the rocket . Then we have the following as the total energy of the rocket/exhaust gas system : <p> where the first term is the kinetic energy of the rocket exhaust gas , the second term is the kinetic energy of the rocket , and the last term ( PE textFuel left ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contained in the unburned fuel . The kinetic potential energy of this fuel when it is converted into exhaust gas is simply the kinetic energy it has at velocity ( u ) , so we can rewrite this equation as <p> which agrees with the rocket equation given above . This equation is the most simplified form of rocket physics , which assumes that all the thrust is provided by the exhaust velocity of the combustion gases alone . A real rocket involves other considerations such as combustion gas pressure inside the nozzle . <p> Mass Energy in Nuclear Reactions : <p> A Deuterium atom , ( 1 2ceH ) , is an isotope of hydrogen that has a nucleus containing one proton and one neutron . Two of them , if collided together at a sufficiently high speed to overcome the Coulomb barrier , can fuse and produce a helium-3 atom ( left ( 2 3ceHeright ) ) and a free neutron ( left ( 0 1cenright ) ) . ( 2 3ceHe ) is an isotope of helium that has two protons but only one neutron . Excess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away as kinetic energy in the products . <h> Now , calculate the energy ( E ) in ( textMeV ) , produced as the result of the following Deuterium+Deuterium fusion reaction : <p> Two deuterium nuclei have a total mass of ( 4.02820358text amu , ) but the total mass of ( 2 3ceHe ) and ( 0 1cen ) is ( 4.024694216text amu , ) which is less . The theory of relativity says mass is another form of energy , so since total energy is conserved , that missing ( 0.00350936text amu ) mass was converted into energy . Using the mass-to-(textMeV) conversion , this works out to about ( E=3.26895text MeV. ) ( square ) <p> Note : ( texteV ) , or electron volt , is not to be confused with ( textV ) , or volt . ( texteV ) has dimensions of energy , or joules , while ( textV ) is joules divided by charge . <h> If the energy produced is carried away by the products , and if both kinetic energy and momentum are conserved , what is the kinetic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Disregard the initial kinetic energies of the reactant Deuterium nuclei . ) <p> which works out to approximately ( 2.44969text MeV ) or ( 2.450text MeV ) , which is the usual published value .

What if we were to combine them ? A massless pendulum arm of relaxed length ( L ) is capable of stretching or compressing lengthwise , and a mass ( m ) is attached to the end of it . Then the position of the mass can be described by two functions to be determined : <p> The first is the radial force along the length of the pendulum arm while the second is the tangential force .

This circuit can be analyzed using Kirchhoff 's Laws , which is the conventional approach . However , to demonstrate the power of the Lagrangian method , which treats energy as a generalized abstract quantity , the following is a way how the LC circuit can be analyzed in terms of energies alone : <p> Let ( qleft(tright) ) be the charge as a function of time ( t ) . Also , let ( L ) be the inductance of the inductor , and ( C ) the capacitance of the capacitor . Then we can make the analogy of kinetic and potential energies as follows :

Electrostatics is the branch of physics which can help explain these amazing wonders . It is very vital because it can be used to explain natural electrostatic phenomena and help us learn how to solve basic problems in this field . So what next ? Let us explore this world of interesting phenomena ! <h> Contents <h> Introduction <p> The charges observed in the universe are of only two types : positive and negative . These charges interact in different ways ; in general , we can say that like charges repel each other and unlike charges attract each other . To be specific , they interact in the following ways : <p> Note : Charges are conserved , i.e. charges can neither be created nor destroyed . <p> Let us now understand one of the most basic concept of electrostatics : quantization of charges . <p> Quantization of Charges : <p> One of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the quantization of charges , according to which a charge can only be an integer multiple of the elementary charge ( e = 1.6times 10-19textC ) .

But they are always found in a colony ( as protons ) . <p> Proton ( a quantum model ) : <p> BBC <p> Now that we have understood that a charge can never be a fraction , we 'll try to get familiar with the force between two charges with the help of the famous Coulomb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law states that the force between two charges is directly proportional to the product of the charges and inversely proportional to the square of their separation .

To find the charges inside and outside respectively of both the charges , we use the above-mentioned rules along with Gauss ' law . <p> Charge distribution between two charged plates of which either/both of them is/are earthed <h> Rearrangement of Charges under the Influence of Electric Field <p> Anyone interested can do it <p> What happens to the charges in an object when an electrified body is brought towards it ? Charges present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an electric field , depending upon the nature of the field . <p> Polarization <p> When an uncharged object is placed in an electric field , its charges rearrange themselves . The electrons move away from the direction of the field , while the positive charges are displaced towards the electric field . This effect is known as polarization . The charges align themselves in the following manner : <p> Dielectrics <p> Capacitors <p> In the above diagram , ( ( A ) ) is the distribution of electrical charges in an object , being influenced by a nearby electrified body ( ( B ) . ) What are the object ( ( A ) ) and the type of charge on ( ( B ) , ) respectively ? <h> Applications <p> Electrostatics is the field of physics and especially electrodynamics that has many examples that can be seen in real life . Out of all of them , lightning and the Van de Graaff generator are a couple , one of which is natural while the other is one of the most ingenious human inventions ever . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ below , and hopefully show you the utter beauty of science , especially physics . <p> Lightning <p> So , we have all seen lightning . It is that spark in the sky when the weather is n't too nice . But , trust me when I say that it is not as boring as it seems ! We all know from the previously discussed topics that 2 bodies which have a potential difference will always cause charges to flow from a higher potential region to a lower one . Well , that is what all lightning is ! <p> During a storm , or in a humid weather , the air between the clouds and between the clouds and the ground gets partially ionized , i.e. it allows the charge to flow through it , unlike the neutral air we have in hot weathers . So , this causes a potential difference to be developed between the two surfaces , which further causes a flow of charges , and hence an electric shock is produced in the form of a zig-zagprojectile . This type of sudden discharge occurs because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , because of which they become very unstable , and hence they come to equilibrium by this process . <p> Now , the basic question that arises is , " Why zig-zag ? " <p> The reason is simple . The path of least resistance is the path that is the motive of every single charge in the lightning strike . Moreover , the entire atmosphere varies with humidity , temperature , pressure , and what not as we move along it . This causes fluctuations in its resistance , and hence the path is never straight , but rather it is one of the millions of possibilities that a lightning surge could have taken ! <p> The Van De Graaff Generator <p> So , the next application on our list is the amazing Van de Graff generator . According to me , it is one of the best inventions by the human mind , but its principle is pretty simple . <p> So , picture this : you want to create a very high potential barrier or a very high potential difference between an object and its surroundings . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charge from the outside of the object , it would get really harder as you go on , as you 'd have to face increasing amount repulsions . To overcome this problem , and to create large potential differences , that could be used in various fields ; for example , in accelerating a subatomic particle , we use this device . <p> The working of Van de Graaff generator is pretty cool , to be honest . What happens is that we use the principle of the motion of electric charge from a higher potential to lower potential . In the above diagram , you can see a pointed object D at the bottom and a pointed object E at the top . These are known as brushes and they help in collecting or depositing charges . <p> The brush D deposits a positive charge on an insulated and rotating sheet , which then transports this charge to the brush E , which in turn let 's the charge flow through it , and deposits it on the larger sphere in the end . In this way , we can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only stop when we reach the breakdown voltage of the environment surrounding the apparatus . <p> Now the question arises , " Why wo n't we face the similar repulsions as before ? " <p> That 's a perfectly logical assumption to make , but the problem is that , now , we are transporting the charge not against the charge on the bigger sphere ( as all its charge is on its outer surface ) . Moreover , with a little more mathematical manipulation , you can clearly show that the potential of the bigger sphere will always be greater than the inner pulleys , in case of a positive charge . <p> In the end , if you are even a teensy bit interested , I 'd highly recommend you to check out this collection of electrostatic experiments and lectures by a professor at MIT , who 's really good at what he does .

@@77511806 @6211806/ <h> Quiz 26449 @qwx646449 <p> The orthocenter of a triangle is the intersection of the triangle 's three altitudes . It has several important properties and relations with other parts of the triangle , including its circumcenter , incenter , area , and more . <p> The orthocenter is typically represented by the letter ( H ) . <h> Contents <h> Finding the orthocenter <p> The location of the orthocenter depends on the type of triangle . If the triangle is acute , the orthocenter will lie within it . If the triangle is obtuse , the orthocenter will lie outside of it . Finally , if the triangle is right , the orthocenter will be the vertex at the right angle . <p> Because the three altitudes always intersect at a single point ( proof in later section ) , the orthocenter can be found by determining the intersection of any two of them . This is especially useful when using coordinate geometry , since the calculations are dramatically simplified by the need to find only two equations of lines ( and their intersection ) . <h> A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ B= ( 14,0 ) ) , and ( C= ( 5,12 ) ) . What are the coordinates of the orthocenter ? <p> The easiest altitude to find is the one from ( C ) to ( AB ) , since that is simply the line ( x=5 ) . The next easiest to find is the one from ( B ) to ( AC ) , since ( AC ) can be calculated as ( y=frac125x ) . A line perpendicular to ( AC ) is of the form ( y=-frac512x+b ) , for some ( b ) , and as this line goes through ( ( 14,0 ) ) , the equation of the altitude is ( y=-frac512x+frac356 ) . <p> Finally , the intersection of this line and the line ( x=5 ) is ( ( 5 , frac154 ) ) , which is thus the location of the orthocenter . <h> Proof of existence <p> The most natural proof is a consequence of Ceva 's theorem , which states that ( AD , BE , CF ) concur if and only if ( fracAFFB cdot fracBDDC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ E , F ) are the feet of the altitudes . <p> therefore the three altitudes coincide at a single point , the orthocenter . <h> Properties <p> For convenience when discussing general properties , it is conventionally assumed that the original triangle in question is acute . The same properties usually apply to the obtuse case as well , but may require slight reformulation . <p> Interestingly , the three vertices and the orthocenter form an orthocentric system : any of the four points is the orthocenter of the triangle formed by the other three . <p> An incredibly useful property is that the reflection of the orthocenter over any of the three sides lies on the circumcircle of the triangle . There is a more visual way of interpreting this result : beginning with a circular piece of paper , draw a triangle inscribed in the paper , and fold the paper inwards along the three edges . The three arcs meet at the orthocenter of the triangle. 1 <p> This result has a number of important corollaries . The most immediate is that the angle formed at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : <p> If the altitude from the vertex at the right angle to the hypotenuse splits the hypotenuse into two lengths of ( p ) and ( q ) , then the length of that altitude is ( sqrtpq ) . <p> Triangle ( ABC ) has a right angle at ( C ) . Point ( D ) lies on hypotenuse ( AB ) such that ( CD ) is perpendicular to ( AB ) . If ( AD=4 ) and ( BD=9 ) , what is the area of the triangle ? <p> Another corollary is that the circumcircle of the triangle formed by any two points of a triangle and its orthocenter is congruent to the circumcircle of the original triangle . This is because the circumcircle of ( BHC ) can be viewed as the Locus of ( H ) as ( A ) moves around the original circumcircle . <p> Finally , this process ( remarkably ) can be reversed : if any point on the circumcircle is reflected over the three sides , the resulting three points are collinear , and the orthocenter always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somewhat different note , the orthocenter of a triangle is related to the circumcircle of the triangle in a deep way : the two points are isogonal conjugates , meaning that the reflections of the altitudes over the angle bisectors of a triangle intersect at the circumcenter of the triangle . <h> Orthic triangle <p> The triangle formed by the feet of the three altitudes is called the orthic triangle . It has several remarkable properties . For example , the orthocenter of a triangle is also the incenter of its orthic triangle . Equivalently , the altitudes of the original triangle are the angle bisectors of the orthic triangle . <p> The sides of the orthic triangle have length ( acos A , bcos B ) , and ( ccos C ) , making the perimeter of the orthic triangle ( acos A+bcos B+ccos C ) . The orthic triangle has the smallest perimeter among all triangles that could be inscribed in triangle ( ABC ) . <p> Kelvin the Frog lives in a triangle ( ABC ) with side lengths 4 , 5 and 6 . One day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the triangle , hops in a straight line to some point on side ( BC ) of the triangle , hops in a straight line to some point on side ( CA ) of the triangle , and finally hops back to his original position on side ( AB ) of the triangle . The smallest distance Kelvin could have hopped is ( fracmn ) for relatively prime positive integers ( m ) and ( n ) . What is ( m+n ) ? <p> The circumcircle of the orthic triangle contains the midpoints of the sides of the original triangle , as well as the points halfway from the vertices to the orthocenter . This circle is better known as the nine point circle of a triangle . <p> The orthic triangle is also homothetic to two important triangles : the triangle formed by the tangents to the circumcircle of the original triangle at the vertices ( the tangential triangle ) , and the triangle formed by extending the altitudes to hit the circumcircle of the original triangle .

It is generally one of the first algorithms taught in computer science courses because it is a good algorithm to learn to build intuition about sorting . While sorting is a simple concept , it is a basic principle used in complex computer programs such as file search , data compression , and path finding . Running time is an important thing to consider when selecting a sorting algorithm since efficiency is often thought of in terms of speed .

They have been used to predict the orbits of many objects such as asteroids and comets , and were pivotal in the discovery of dark matter in the Milky Way . Violations of Kepler 's laws have been used to explore more sophisticated models of gravity , such as general relativity . While Newton 's laws generalize Kepler 's laws , most problems related to the periods of orbits are still best solved using Kepler 's laws , since they are simpler . <p> Recall the statements of Kepler 's laws : <p> Planets move in elliptical orbits with the sun at one focus . <p> The line joining planets to either focus sweeps out equal areas in equal times . <p> The square of the period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis ( half the longer side of the ellipse ) : ( T2 propto a3 . ) <p> These laws can be applied to model natural objects like planets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ devices like rockets and satellites in orbit . <p> Although Kepler originally developed his laws in the context of planetary orbits , the results hold for any system with a radial force obeying the inverse square law .

In spite of the fact that quantum mechanics is needed to fully model how electrons orbit nuclei , electrons with very high energy behave as though they had Keplerian orbits , and atoms containing such electrons are known as Rydberg atoms . <h> Contents <h> Halley 's Comet <p> Picture of Halley 's Comet taken from the European spacecraft Giotto in 1986 1 <p> Halley 's Comet is the first comet that astronomers realized had a periodic orbit .

Obtaining this constant requires an extensive derivation . <p> At the point in its orbit where it is closest to the sun , Halley 's comet is only ( 8.8 times 108 text m ) from the sun , coming between the orbits of Mercury and Venus . It is furthest away from the sun at a distance of approximately ( 2a = 5.4 times 1012 text m ) , past the orbit of Neptune . <h> Most Efficient Route to Mars <p> The Hohmann Transfer Orbit 2 <p> The most efficient route from Earth to Mars is called the Hohmann transfer orbit 2 . By Kepler 's third law , it must be the ellipse that touches both orbits with the shortest possible semimajor axis . This is intuitive because without any acceleration , a rocket on Earth would stay in the orbit of Earth . The most efficient route is just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's orbit and ends at the Mars ' orbit . <p> The orbits of Earth and Mars are approximately circular , with radii ( rE = 1 text AU ) and ( rM = 1.542 text AU ) .

How far away from Earth is the astronaut ? <p> This problem can be solved by integrating the Newtonian gravitational force over a straight line going towards Earth to find the position as a function of time and vice versa , but using the trick of applying Kepler 's third law is easier . Suppose the astronaut 's distance from Earth is some number ( R ) , and consider an ellipse with major axis of length slightly larger than ( R ) , with a minor axis ( b ll R ) . This is an ellipse with eccentricity very near one . Taking the limit of this ellipse as the eccentricity goes to one yields a straight line of length R. This suggests that the properties of ellipses may be used to derive quantities related to straight lines in general , since any straight line may be approximated well by an ellipse of eccentricity near one . <p> The time ( t ) it takes to fall down this line is half of the period ( T ) it would take to go around the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ellipse is ( fracR2 ) , by Kepler 's third law <p> for this astronaut 's distance from Earth . This derivation was much more straightforward than the burdensome calculus required to solve Newton 's second law for the gravitational force . <h> Deriving Velocity of Circular motion <p> Astronomers define a galaxy rotation curve to be the plot of the tangential velocity of stars as a function of their distance from the center of any given galaxy . Kepler 's laws can be used to derive the shape of this curve assuming the stars have circular ( or low eccentricity ) orbits . <p> By Kepler 's second law , the area swept out by the line from the galaxy center to a star in a given time must be constant . Since the radius ( r ) to such a star is constant in circular motion , the velocity ( v ) of these stars in orbit must also be constant . In that case , the period of rotation ( T ) is ( frac2 pi rv ) . Plugging this into Kepler 's third law gives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the radius ( r ) , since even if the mass density in a galaxy is homogeneous this means that the mass contained in some radius scales as the radius cubed . That is , a cluster of stars with roughly homogeneous mass density will have mass that scales like ( M(r) = M0 r3 ) . Plugging this into the above expression for ( v ) gives ( v(r) = r sqrtG M0 ) . <p> A galaxy with a cluster of stars in the middle and sparsely spaced stars further out will therefore have a galaxy rotation curve that starts out linear and then falls off like ( frac1sqrtr ) , like curve A in the picture . <p> Astronomers have found that the galaxy rotation curve of the Milky Way does not follow this curve if we take into account all of the known mass in the Milky Way . It looks more like curve B , where the velocity stays approximately constant even far away from the center of the galaxy . This implies that either Kepler 's laws are wrong or there is mass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in which it is known that Kepler 's laws are incomplete or not a good description of nature ( see below ) , physicists are very confident that Kepler 's laws should apply to these stars because their dynamics satisfy the relevant assumptions for Newtonian gravitation .

The perihelion is the point in a planet 's orbit at which it is closest to the sun . Kepler 's first law predicts that the perihelion is constant in time for every orbit . However , the perihelion of Mercury moves every year by a small angle . Even accounting for perturbations due to the gravitational effects of other planets , there was still an unaccounted-for rotation of 43 arc-seconds per century when the orbit was solved in Newtonian gravity . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rotation of the perihelion in 3 million years 4 .

Then , in the second case , there are ( binom74 ) ways to select 4 objects out of the 7 , and then there are ( binom42div 2=3 ) ways to divide these 4 objects into 2 groups of 2 . The total number of ways to arrange the objects is <p> binom73+3binom74 = 40. square <p> Note that this could also be computed using the formula above . <p> Now consider the cases in which the number of bins is small . <p> Number of bins = 1 : Clearly , if the number of bins is 1 , then all of the objects must be in this bin .

If the bins are not identical , then there are ( 2 n ) distributions of the balls since each ball can go into either bin . However , two of these distributions involve all of the balls placed into one bin . Hence , there are ( 2n -2 ) ways in which these balls can be placed into ( 2 ) non-identical bins such that no bin remains empty . <p> Now consider how to modify this scenario to reflect the bins being identical . Let there be balls ( mathfrakB1 ) in the first bin and balls ( mathfrakB2 ) in the second bin . There is an equivalent distribution of having balls ( mathfrakB2 ) in the first bin and balls ( mathfrakB1 ) in the second bin . There are ( 2 ) distributions of distinct objects into distinct bins for every ( 1 ) distribution of distinct objects into identical bins .

Then <p> From these basic cases , any value of ( S ( n , r ) ) can be calculated through the recurrence relation : <p> S ( n , r ) = r S ( n-1 , r ) + S ( n-1 , r-1 ) <p> To develop this relation , consider a single object to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go . There are two cases : <p> Case 1 : The fixed object is in its own bin . There are ( n-1 ) remaining objects to be distributed into ( r - 1 ) bins , which gives ( S ( n-1 , r - 1 ) ) distributions for this case . <p> Case 2 : The fixed object is in a bin with other objects . The remaining ( n-1 ) objects are distributed into ( r ) bins , which gives ( S ( n-1 , r ) ) distributions . For each of these distributions , there are ( r ) ways to group the fixed object with the other objects . Thus , there are ( rS ( n-1 , r ) ) distributions for this case . <p> Summing both cases together yields <p> S ( n , r ) = r S ( n-1 , r ) + S ( n-1 , r-1 ) . square <p> The recurrence relation allows one to calculate Stirling numbers of the second kind from basic cases . <p> How many ways are there to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no bin remains empty ) ? <p> These examples show the power of the recurrence relation , which allows one to calculate any value of ( S ( n , r ) ) from other values of ( S ( n , r ) ) .

In the language of sets , Bell numbers count the partitions of a set of ( n ) objects into non-empty disjoint subsets whose union is the entire set . ( square ) <p> The Stirling numbers denote the number of ways to arrange ( n ) distinct objects into ( k ) identical boxes , and the Bell numbers denote the number of ways to arrange ( n ) distinct objects into up to ( n ) identical objects . Hence , Bell numbers are computed as a sum of Stirling numbers : <p> Bn = sumk=1n S ( n , k ) . <p> From the table of Stirling numbers , the following Bell numbers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ row : <p> How many ways are there to place ( 5 ) differently colored balls into ( 5 ) identical urns if the urns can be empty ? <p> All ( 5 ) balls have to be used . <p> An urn could contain multiple balls . <p> The Bell numbers have their own recurrence relation : <p> Bn+1 = sumk=0n n choose k Bk <p> This will be proven with combinatorics . Consider how the ( ( n+1 ) textth ) element is partitioned . Suppose that there are ( k ) elements which are not in its box , then there are ( n choose k ) ways to pick these ( k ) elements , and thereafter there are ( B k ) ways to arrange these ( k ) elements into identical boxes . Hence , there are ( n choose k Bk ) such arrangements . The resulting Bell number is the sum of all these arrangements across all possible values of ( k ) . ( square ) <p> The simplest way to prove this is to show that the previous recurrence relation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ B(x) ) , from which the result follows by solving the differential equation and evaluating at ( x = 0 ) . <h> Suppose that ( N ) is the product of ( n ) distinct primes . How many ways are there to write ( N ) as the product of positive integers ( ( &gt; 1 ) ) , where the order of terms do not matter ? <p> Consider how placing ( n ) distinct primes into identical boxes gives us a way of writing ( N ) as the product of positive integers . First , find the prime factorization of each term of the product , and place the factors of each term into a box . Then , since ( N ) is the product of distinct prime factors , each prime factor appears in a unique box . Since the product of all of these terms is ( N ) , each prime factor must be in a box . Conversely , given any arrangement of these ( n ) distinct primes into ( r ) identical boxes , multiply the primes in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these terms gives the value of ( N ) . This establishes the bijection . Thus , the number of ways is ( Bn . square ) <p> How many different factorizations are there of <p> 2310 = 2cdot 3cdot 5cdot 7cdot 11 ? <p> For instance , the number ( 42 = 2cdot 3cdot 7 ) has five different factorizations : 
@@77511823 @6211823/ <h> What is Uniform Circular Motion ? <p> Uniform circular motion defines the motion of an object traveling at a constant speed around a fixed center point or axis . The object travels around a curved path and maintains a constant radial distance from the center point at any given time . Realistically speaking , a perfect circle does not exist , but it is useful to study the case of a perfect circle in order to understand how an object might move around an ellipse and to approximate the motion of an object that is almost circular in nature . Some examples of this type of motion are the orbit of a planet , a car going around a circular track or a conical pendulum . <h> Revolution and Rotation <p> Revolution is a type of circular motion where the object moves around a fixed center point called the axis of revolution given that the axis is some distance away from the object , such as how the earth revolves around the sun . <p> Rotation is another type of circular motion where an object moves around a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ object , such as how the earth rotates around an axis . Rotation can be viewed as the revolution of all of the particles that make up the object . <h> Radius and Position <p> Radius ( ( r ) ) is the constant distance that the object remains away from the center point as it revolves around it . However , if thought of as a vector with the center point of the circle being the initial point and the point lying on the circumference of the circle being the terminal point , any two radii vectors are not the same . Two vectors ( vecOA ) and ( vecOB ) which are two radii with the same magnitude are in different directions as seen below . <p> vecr=vecrcostheta + vecrsintheta <p> Position ( ( s ) ) describes the location of the object on the circle and is given by the radius vector <h> Angular Displacement , Velocity and Acceleration <p> Angular Displacement ( ( theta ) ) is an angle between any two points on the circle relative to the axis of revolution and is given in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ function of time t : <p> displaystyle theta(t) = omega t . <p> Angular Velocity ( ( omega ) ) is the change in angular displacement over the change in time and is in units of ( fracrads : ) <p> displaystyle omega = fracdthetadt . <p> Angular Acceleration ( ( alpha ) ) is the change in angular velocity over the change in time and is in units of ( fracrads2 : ) <p> displaystyle alpha = fracdomegadt . <p> <p> An object that revolves in a clockwise direction can be thought of in a two dimensional space as revolving to the right . Traditionally clockwise motion is thought to be in the negative direction . <p> An object that revolves in a counterclockwise direction can be thought of in a two dimensional space as revolving to the left . Counterclockwise motion is thought to be in the positive direction . <p> ( vecomega ) is a vector perpendicular to the plane of orbit and parallel to the axis of revolution . <p> The angular displacement of the particles of a rotating object is irrespective of the radius . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the axis of rotation will have the same angular velocity as an object that is ( 100text m ) from the axis of rotation . This is easily observed by looking out at the stars at night . Constellations are formed of stars that are all different distances from the Earth but yet we see them all move at the same speed . <h> Displacement and Distance <p> Displacement ( ( d ) ) is the change in position of the object relative to some starting point and the term distance is reserved for the measure of the path traveled along the perimeter of the circle . A fraction of the perimeter is called an arc , and has a length ( l ) measured in meters ( ( textm ) . ) Arc length is given by <p> If the object makes exactly one revolution then the displacement is zero , and the distance traveled is the circumference of the circle <p> C=2pi r . <h> Period and Frequency <p> Period ( ( T ) ) is the amount of time ( t ) in seconds that it takes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 2 pi ) is the angular displacement of one revolution and ( omega ) is the angular velocity , the formula for ( T ) is as follows : <p> T=frac2piomega . <p> Frequency ( ( f ) ) is the number of revolutions per second in units of Hertz ( ( textHz ) . ) It is the inverse of the period : <p> f=frac1T . <h> Tangential Velocity <p> A tangent is a line which touches exactly one point on the circle . The significance of the tangent is that at this point the circle and the line share the same slope , or rate of change . Although we can not find the slope of a curve , we can find the slope of the tangent , or the instantaneous rate of change . <p> Instantaneous or tangential velocity ( ( v ) ) is the velocity of the revolving object at a given point along its path of motion . The magnitude of the velocity , or the speed , remains constant , but in order for the object to travel in a circle , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tangential speed of the object is the product of its angular counterpart and the magnitude of the radius : <p> vecv=omega r . <p> The direction of the tangential velocity is orthogonal to the radius vector for that given point . <p> Vectors can be used to find the velocity but the direction can also be given by the right hand rule : <p> vecv=vecomega times vecr . <p> The velocity can also be viewed as the change in position ( s ) over the change in time : <p> Centripetal force is the force which pulls the object towards the center and keeps the object moving in a circle despite the direction of its velocity . Centripetal force is in the direction opposite of the radius . Centripetal force is often caused by other forces such as gravity , tension , or electromagnetism : <p> Fc =malphac , <p> where ( m ) is the mass of the revolving object . Mass ( ( m ) ) is the quantity which is solely dependent on the inertia of an object , or its ability to resist changes in its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of inertia ( ( I ) , ) sometimes called the second moment of area or the the angular mass , is proportional to the mass and the square of the radius : <p> I=mr2 . <h> Angular Momentum <p> Angular momentum ( ( L ) ) can be thought of as how hard it is to change the state of motion of an object with regards to both its angular mass and velocity : <p> L=Iomega . <h> Kinetic Energy <p> Kinetic energy is the amount of energy that an object has due to its current state of motion . Kinetic energy is generally given by the following formula : <p> k=frac12mvecv2 . <p> When considering rotational movement , however , we know the equivalent of the mass to be the moment of inertia , ( I , ) and the velocity to be the angular velocity , ( omega : ) 
@@77511824 @6211824/ <h> Axiom of Determinacy 26449 @qwx646449 <p> The axiom of determinacy is a proposed axiom of set theory that is consistent with Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory ( ZF ) but is inconsistent with the axiom of choice ( and hence ZFC ) . It was proposed by Mycielski and Steinhaus in 1962 as a way to avoid some of the more unpleasant consequences of the axiom of choice . In particular , it implies that the subsets of the real numbers are well-behaved in certain precise ways ; for example , the sets constructed in the Banach-Tarski paradox do not exist in ZFD , the Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory with the axiom of determinacy . <h> Contents <h> Statement of the axiom <p> The axiom is concerned with the outcomes of certain infinite combinatorial games .

@@77511827 @6211827/ 26449 @qwx646449 <p> Electronic factors that influence organic reactions include the inductive effect , the electromeric effect , resonance effects , and hyperconjugation . These electronic factors work off of organic molecules , which are themselves diverse and robust , despite their limited number of components . Most biological molecules are made from a combination of the following six elements : carbon , hydrogen , nitrogen , oxygen , phosphorus , and sulfur ( known collectively as CHNOPS ) . Yet , the limited number of building blocks does not prevent organic compounds from taking on diverse properties in their physical characteristics and chemical reactivity . <p> Part of the variety in organic chemistry stems from differences in electron behavior when elements other than carbon and hydrogen participate in molecular bonds . The three compounds pictured above have similar formula units and structures , but react very differently from one another . Varying electronegativity can cause delocalization effects , where the electron cloud for a given bond expands to more than two atoms within the molecule . <h> Contents <h> Polarity of Organic Molecules <p> Partial polarity within a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ molecule , leading to different behavior than what would be expected in a non-polar version of the compound , where no sections were electron-rich or electron-deficient . <p> Saturated hydrocarbons are nonreactive because there is no polarity in ( C-C ) bond and practically no polarity in ( C-H ) bonds . Carbon and hydrogen are almost identical in electronegativity , so the electrons involved in a bond between the two atoms are equally attracted to each nucleus and spend roughly the same amount of time orbiting one as the other . <p> Electron density is evenly distributed between the two atoms in a non-polar bond , which prevents charged species including from attacking or altering the bond . In contrast , charged species ( electrophiles and nucleophiles ) react with polar organic molecules because there is an imbalance in electron density or polarity . <p> Elements with higher electronegativity , including oxygen and the halide group , can change the electron density around an organic molecule and make the molecule more reactive . <p> Electronic effects complicate chemical reactions , and they can stabilize a molecule , make a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ react in a desired fashion , or affect the acidity or basicity .

The effect rapidly dies out and is usually not significant after the ( 2textnd ) carbon atom , or at most the ( 3textrd ) ) . <p> The inductive effect is permanent , but relatively weak , and can be easily overshadowed by the electronic effects discussed later . <p> There are two categories of inductive effects : the electron withdrawing ( -I effect ) and the electron releasing ( +I effect ) . The latter is also called the electron donating effect . In the image above , ( X ) is electron-withdrawing and ( Y ) is electron-donating . <p> These relative inductive effects are measured with reference to hydrogen : <p> -I effect : The -I effect is seen around a more electronegative atom or group , and electron density is higher there than elsewhere in the molecule . Electron-withdrawing groups include halogen , nitro ( ( -textNO2 ) ) , cyano ( ( -textCN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ester ( ( -textCOOR ) ) , and aryloxy ( ( -textOAr ) ) . <p> +I effect : The +I effect is observed among the less electronegative atoms of the molecule by electron releasing ( or electron donating ) groups . The alkyl groups are usually considered electron releasing ( or electron donating ) groups . <h> Resonance <p> Sometimes , there are several correct Lewis structures for a given molecule . Ozone ( ( O 3 ) ) is one example . The compound is a chain of three oxygen atoms , and minimizing the charges while giving each atom an octet of electrons requires that the central oxygen atom form a single bond with one terminal oxygen and a double bond with the other terminal oxygen . <p> When drawing the Lewis structure , the choice of placement for the double bond is arbitrary , and either choice is equally correct . The multiple correct ways of drawing the Lewis structure are called the resonance forms . <p> Based on the resonance forms , a beginning chemistry student might wonder if ozone has bonds of two different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bonds . However , the ozone molecule is perfectly symmetrical , with bonds that are the same length . None of the resonance forms represent the true structure of the molecule . Rather , the negative charge of the electrons that would form a double bond are delocalized , or distributed evenly across the three oxygen atoms . The true structure is a composite , with bonds shorter than what would be expected for single bonds , but longer than the expected double bonds . <p> The resonance hybrid for ozone is found by identifying the multiple resonance structures for the molecule . <p> Thus for ( O 3 ) the two structures ( I and II ) shown above constitute the canonical structures or resonance structures and their hybrid ( i.e. the III structure ) represents the structure of ( O 3 ) more accurately . Resonance is represented by a double-headed arrow between the resonance structures , as illustrated above . <p> ( 1 ) <p> ( 2 ) <p> The resonance hybrid is more stable than its canonical forms , i.e. the actual compound ( hybrid ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Resonance stability increases with increased number of resonance structures . <p> The difference in the experimental and calculated energies is the amount of energy by which the compound is stable . This difference is known as resonance energy or delocalisation energy . <p> All resonance structures are not equivalent . The following rules help determine whether or not a resonance structure will contribute significantly to the hybrid structure . <p> Rules of Resonance <p> Rule 1 : The most significant resonance contributor has the greatest number of full octets ( or if applicable , expanded octets ) . <p> Rule 2 : The most significant resonance contributor has the fewest atoms with formal charges . <p> Rule 3 : If formal charges can not be avoided , the most significant resonance contributor has the negative formal charges on the most electronegative atoms , and the positive formal charges on the least electronegative atoms . <p> Rule 4 : The most significant resonance contributor has the greatest number of covalent bonds . <p> Rule 5 : If a pi bond is present , the most significant resonance contributor has this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ periodic table ( usually carbon pi bonded to boron , carbon , nitrogen , oxygen , or fluorine ) . <p> Rule 6 : Aromatic resonance contributors are more significant than resonance contributors that are not aromatic . <h> Mesomeric Effect <p> The permanent polarization of a group conjugated with a ( pi ) bond or a set of alternate ( pi ) bonds is transmitted through the ( pi ) electrons of the system , resulting in a different distribution of electrons in the unsaturated chain . This kind of electron distribution in unsaturated compounds conjugated with electron-releasing or withdrawing groups or atoms is called mesomeric effect . <p> As shown above , a polarity is induced in compounds due to transfer of electrons through ( pi ) bonds . This effect is a consequence of resonance and is seen in compounds that contain a double bond that is separated from another double bond or a lone pair of electrons by a single bond . <h> Electromeric effect <p> The electromeric effect is an intramolecular movement of electrons from a pi bond to another atom in the molecule due @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reversible . <p> There are two distinct types of electromeric effects : <p> ( i ) Positive Electromeric Effect ( +E effect ) : In this effect the ( pi ) -electrons of the multiple bond are transferred to that atom to which the reagent gets attached . For example : <p> ( ii ) Negative Electromeric Effect ( -E effect ) : In this effect the ( pi ) -electrons of the multiple bomd are transferred to that atom to which the attacking reagents do not get attached . For example : <h> Hyperconjugation <p> Hyperconjugation helps explain the stability of alkyl radicals . It involves the delocalisation of ( sigma ) -electrons belonging to the ( C-H ) bond of the alkyl group attaching to an atom with an unshared ( p ) orbital.

( square ) <h> Proof using Fermat numbers <p> For this proof , we need to know what Fermat numbers are . Fermat numbers ( Fn ) are of the form ( 22n+1 , ) where ( n ) is a non-negative integer . The first few Fermat numbers are ( 3 , 5 , 17 , 257 , 65537 ) . <p> We 'll prove that any two Fermat numbers are relatively prime . Since there are an infinite number of Fermat numbers , this will prove that there are an infinite number of primes . <p> Take a look at the following relation : <p> displaystyleprodi=0n-1 Fi=Fn-2. qquad ( 1 ) <p> This is not hard to prove using induction . For ( n=1 ) , we have ( F0=3 ) and ( F1-2=3 ) . So ( ( 1 ) ) is true for ( n=1 ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ numbers are co-prime since if ( Fi ) and ( Fn ) ( with ( i&lt;n ) ) have a common factor ( k ) , then from ( ( 1 ) ) , ( kmid2 ) . This means ( k ) equals either ( 1 ) or ( 2 ) . But ( k ) can not be equal to ( 2 ) since all Fermat numbers are odd . That means ( k=1 ) and ( Fi ) and ( Fn ) are co-prime . <p> From that we can say there are infinitely many primes. ( square ) <h> Idea similar to the proof using Fermat numbers <p> It is enough to find an infinite sequence of natural numbers ( 1 &lt; a1 &lt; a2 &lt; a3 &lt; cdots ) that are pairwise relatively prime ( i.e. , without a common prime factor ) . So , if ( p1 ) is a prime dividing ( a1 ) , if ( p2 ) is a prime dividing ( a2 ) , etc. , then ( p1 , p2 , cdots , ) are all different . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relatively prime integers with ( S0 &gt; a geq 1 ) , the sequence defined by the recursive relation <p> Note that since ( pi ge 2 , ei ge 0 ) , we have ( piei ge 1 ) for all ( i ) , and thus ( piei le n ) for all ( i ) . Thus ( ei le logpi n le log2 n ) . Thus if we fix some large ( N ) and let ( n le N ) , all components of ( f(n) ) must be at most ( log2 n le log2 N ) . Thus among ( f(1) , f(2) , f(3) , ldots , f(N) ) , there are at most ( ( log2 N ) k ) distinct values . But since ( f ) is bijective , we need ( N ) distinct values . Thus we need ( ( log2 N ) k ge N ) . This is clearly false for large enough ( N ) . So there are infinitely many prime numbers . <h> F++rstenberg 's topological proof <p> On the set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subbase of all non-constant arithmetic progressions ( unbounded in both directions ) . It can be shown that all open sets in this topology are either infinite or empty . <p> For each prime ( p ) and integer ( k ) , define ( Ap , k ) to be the set of all integers in the arithmetic progression with difference ( p ) , containing ( k ) . We can easily see that ( Ap , 0 ) is precisely the set of all integers divisible by ( p ) . Moreover , we have ( Ap , 1 cup Ap , 2 cup ldots cup Ap , p-1 = ( Ap , 0 ) c ) . The left hand side is the union of open sets and thus open ; so ( Ap , 0 ) is closed . <p> Now suppose there are finitely many prime numbers . Then the union ( U ) of all ( Ap , 0 ) , being a finite union of closed sets , is also closed . But by definition of prime numbers , the only integers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -1 . Thus the complement of ( U ) is ( -1 , 1 ) . Being the complement of a closed set , ( -1 , 1 ) should be open ; but this is a finite non-empty set , contradicting our result that open sets in this topology are either infinite or empty . Thus there must be infinitely many prime numbers . <h> Largest known prime number <p> Despite there being infinitely many prime numbers , it 's actually difficult to find a large one . For recreational purposes , people have been trying to find as large prime number as possible . The current largest known prime number is ( 274,207,281 - 1 ) , having 22,338,618 digits . This was found by the Great Internet Mersenne Prime Search project , which uses distributed computing to discover prime numbers in the form ( 2n - 1 ) , known as Mersenne primes . Mersenne primes are very rare ; in fact , it 's an open problem whether there are infinitely many Mersenne primes or not . Only 49 are known so far , the largest of which is the above .

( square ) <p> Note that , strictly speaking , one must always verify if ( n ) ( or fewer ) objects do not fit in ( n ) boxes . The pigeonhole principle guarantees that there will be a collision if more than ( n ) objects are placed in ( n ) boxes ; however , it does not specify if ( n ) or fewer objects can fit in ( n ) boxes , which may certainly not be true depending on the restrictions given in the problem ( imagine that some pigeons do not like each other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blockages ) . <p> A school has ( n ) students .

What is the maximum value of ( d ) over all possible configurations of points ? <p> First , consider a trivial configuration of the points . Let all points be evenly spaced with one point at each end of the segment . In this case , the points divide up the line into ( n ) segments , each of length ( frac Ln ) . <p> Clearly , we can do no worse than ( frac Ln ) , but is it possible to do better ? <p> At first glance , it appears that the answer is no . Shifting any non-endpoint increases the length of one of the interior segments but always at the expense of shortening a neighboring segment . <p> Using the pigeonhole principle , we can approach the problem as follows : Consider each of the ( n ) evenly spaced segments as a " box " and each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ item to be placed into the boxes . The pigeonhole principle implies that at least one box ( or segment ) must have two items ( or points ) , which guarantees that no two consecutive points can be farther apart than ( frac Ln ) .

Show that there exists two points with distance at most ( frac13 ) apart . <p> Consider the a partition of the triangle into nine congruent equilateral triangles as shown below : <p> Each of the nine smaller triangles represents a box , with each of the ten points an item to be placed into the boxes . By the pigeonhole principle , at least one of the nine triangles must contain at least two points . Since the maximum distance between any two points in one of these triangles is ( frac13 ) , no two points can be separated by greater than distance ( frac13 ) . ( square ) <p> Let the average of a set of positive numbers be ( mu ) . Use the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number less than or equal to ( mu ) . <p> Choosing a set of ( n ) numbers that average to ( mu ) is equivalent to placing ( n + 1 ) points on a line segment of length ( n mu ) with two points fixed as the endpoints . Each of the ( n ) segments formed between consecutive points represents one of the numbers in the set . <p> Furthermore , partition the entire segment into ( n ) sub-segments of length ( mu ) . The pigeonhole principle thus implies that at least one segment contains at least two points or , namely , that there must be at least one segment of length ( mu ) or less . It immediately follows that at least one number is less than or equal to ( mu ) . ( square ) <h> Generalized Pigeonhole Principle <p> A more general form of the pigeonhole principle is as follows : <p> Pigeonhole principle ( general form ) : <p> If more than ( k cdot n ) objects are placed into ( n ) boxes then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) objects . <p> For the sake of contradiction , suppose there are no boxes that contain more than ( k ) pigeons . In that case , each pigeonhole may contain at most ( k ) pigeons , and all ( n ) pigeonholes may contain a total of at most ( k cdot n ) pigeons . But this contradicts the assumption that there were more than ( k cdot n ) objects . It follows that at least one box must contain more than ( k ) pigeons. ( square ) <p> It should be noted that contradiction permits only the weakest claim possible regarding the contents of the boxes . If it is not the case that every box has at most ( k ) objects , all one can be certain of is that at least one box has at least one more than ( k ) objects . <p> What is the minimum number of cards that must be drawn from a standard deck to guarantee at least three cards all of the same suit ? <p> Let the four suits correspond to our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we draw more than ( 2 cdot 4 ) cards from the ( 4 ) suits , then at least one suit must have more than ( 2 ) drawn cards . <p> Lastly , we should note that , with eight cards drawn , it is possible to have exactly two cards of each suit , so the minimum number is indeed ( 9. square ) <h> Pigeonhole Principle - Problem Solving <p> I have 7 pairs of red socks , 6 pairs of blue socks , and 5 pairs of green socks in my drawer .

Here the ( 4 ) chosen socks are the " objects " and the ( 3 ) colors are the " boxes " ; by PP1 , it follows that at least two of the four chosen must have the same color and hence must be a matching pair .

@@77511840 @6211840/ <h> Dilworth 's Theorem 26449 @qwx646449 <p> Dilworth 's Theorem is a result about the width of partially ordered sets . It is equivalent to ( and hence can be used to prove ) several beautiful theorems in combinatorics , including Hall 's marriage theorem . One well-known corollary of Dilworth 's theorem is a result of Erd+s and Szekeres on sequences of real numbers : every sequence of rs+1 real numbers has an increasing subsequence of length r+1 or a decreasing subsequence of length s+1 . <h> Contents <h> Definitions <p> A partially ordered set is a set ( S ) with a relation ( le ) on ( S ) satisfying : ( 1 ) ( a le a ) for all ( a in S ) ( reflexivity ) ( 2 ) if ( ale b ) and ( ble a ) , then ( a=b ) ( antisymmetry ) ( 3 ) if ( a le b ) and ( b le c ) , then ( a le c ) ( transitivity ) Note that for two given elements ( a ) and ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( a ) and ( b ) are comparable , that is , ( a le b ) or ( b le a ) . If this is true for all pairs ( a ) and ( b ) in ( S ) , we say that ( S ) is totally ordered . <p> The set ( S ) of people in the world , with ( le ) defined by " is a direct descendant of , " is a partially ordered set . The set ( T ) of positive integers , with ( le ) defined by " divides , " is a partially ordered set . <p> Note that neither of these sets are totally ordered . A brother and sister are not comparable in ( S ) , since they are not direct descendants of each other ; and ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) are not comparable in ( T ) , since neither divides the other . <p> There are two natural ways to define the width of a finite partially ordered set , which can be thought of as measuring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ width is defined to be a certain positive integer , which is ( 1 ) if and only if the set is totally ordered . <p> A chain in a partially ordered set is a subset of elements which are all comparable to each other . An antichain is a subset of elements , no two of which are comparable to each other . <p> ( Definition 1 ) The width of a finite partially ordered set ( S ) is the minimum number of chains needed to cover ( S ) , i.e. the minimum number of chains such that any element of ( S ) is in at least one of the chains . <p> ( Definition 2 ) The width of a finite partially ordered set ( S ) is the maximum size of an antichain in ( S ) . <p> As mentioned above , both of these definitions indicate in some sense how far away ( S ) is from being totally ordered . Note that a chain is a totally ordered subset of ( S ) , so both definitions give width ( 1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ S ) be the set of divisors of ( 30 ) , with divisibility as the partial order . Then the following chains cover ( S ) : 1,2,6,30 , 3,15 , 5,10 . And ( 2,3,5 ) is an antichain of length ( 3 ) . It is not immediately obvious , but the chain cover is minimal ( though not unique ) , and the antichain is maximal ( though not unique ) . So both definitions of width give ( 3 ) for this partially ordered set . <h> Hasse diagrams <p> Partially ordered sets are often visualized via Hasse diagrams , which are arrangements of the elements of the set with edges connecting any two comparable elements that have no elements in between them , that is : ( x ) and ( y ) are connected if ( x le y ) and there is no element ( z ne x , y ) such that ( xle z le y ) .

The widths of these sets are ( 3 ) and ( 5 ) , respectively , using either definition , which corresponds to the " width " of the diagram . Note also that these particular diagrams are drawn so that reading horizontally on any given level produces an antichain . The diagram also helps clarify the fact we cited earlier , that the size of an antichain is at least as large as the number of chains required to cover the set . <p> For any pair of distinct elements ( a ) and ( b ) in ( S ) , ( anmid b ) and ( bnmid a ) . <p> What is the maximum value of ( S ) ? <h> Statement of Dilworth 's Theorem and Mirsky 's Theorem <p> Dilworth 's Theorem : Let ( S ) be a finite partially ordered set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a minimal chain cover of ( S ) . <p> So Dilworth 's Theorem says that the two definitions of width given above coincide with each other . <p> As is often the case , when proving that two quantities are equal , the proof shows that they are less than or equal to each other . One of these inequalities is much easier than the other : Suppose the maximal antichain has length ( d ) ; then any chain cover has to have at least ( d ) chains , because no two members of the antichain can be in the same chain , but they each have to be in one of the chains because the chains cover . <p> The other half of the proof of the theorem is given at the end of this wiki . The following " dual " theorem is easier to prove : <p> Mirsky 's Theorem : Let ( S ) be a finite partially ordered set . The size of a maximal chain in ( S ) equals the size of a minimal antichain cover of ( S @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , one half is easy . Suppose the maximal chain has length ( d ) ; then any antichain cover has at least ( d ) antichains , since no two elements of the chain can be in the same antichain . <p> Now define a function ( f colon S to mathbb N ) by ( f(s) = ) the size of a maximal chain whose largest element is ( s ) . Note that if ( f(s) = f(t) ) , then ( s ) and ( t ) can not be comparable ( why ? ) . So , for any positive integer ( n ) , the set ( f-1(n) ) of all the elements ( s ) such that ( f(s) = n ) is an antichain . If the maximal chain has length ( d ) , then the sets ( f-1(1) , f-1(2) , ldots , f-1(d) ) form an antichain cover of ( S ) .

It is straightforward to check that the two Hasse diagrams in the above examples are constructed in that way . <p> Let ( X ) be a set of subsets of ( 1,2,3,4 ) such that no element of ( X ) is completely contained in any other element of ( X ) : that is , for any two distinct subsets ( A , B in X ) , ( A nsubseteq B ) and ( B nsubseteq A ) . <p> What is the maximum possible value of ( X ) ? <p> ( Bonus : generalize to ( 1,2 , ldots , n ) . ) <h> Applications <p> Erd+s-Szekeres Theorem : A sequence of at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of length ( r+1 ) or a decreasing subsequence of length ( s+1 ) . <p> For instance : any sequence of ( 7 ) real numbers has an increasing subsequence of length ( 4 ) or a decreasing subsequence of length ( 3 ) .

Define an ordering ( preceq ) on this sequence by ( ai preceq aj ) if ( i le j ) and ( ai le aj ) . A chain with respect to this ordering is just an increasing subsequence , and an antichain is a decreasing subsequence . Suppose there is no antichain of length ( s+1 ) . Then the width of the set is at most ( s ) , so by Dilworth 's Theorem the set can be covered by ( le s ) chains . If all of these chains have length ( le r ) , then the set has at most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least one of the chains has length ( ge r+1 ) , so there is an increasing subsequence of length ( r+1 ) . ( square ) <p> This is a special case of a general fact about partially ordered sets , which follows from Dilworth 's Theorem in exactly the same way : <p> A partially ordered set of size ( ge rs+1 ) has a chain of length ( r+1 ) or an antichain of length ( s+1 ) . <p> Let ( I1 , I2 , ldots , I10 ) be intervals on the real number line .

Show that there must be four intervals that share a common point . <p> Solution : Define a partial order by ( I le I ' ) if and only if ( I ) and ( I ' ) are disjoint and ( I ) is to the left of ( I ' ) . The assumption is that there is no chain of length ( 3+1 ) , so there must be an antichain of length ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intervals , no two of which are disjoint . Hence they share a common point . ( Why ? ) <h> Proof of Dilworth 's Theorem <p> The easiest proof is by induction on the size of the set . Let ( d ) be the size of the largest antichain of ( S ) . The proof will show that ( S ) can be covered by ( d ) chains . The base case is trivial . So suppose the result has been proven for all sets smaller than ( S ) . <p> First , if no two elements of ( S ) are comparable , then ( S ) itself is an antichain and it can be covered by ( d=S ) chains each of length ( 1 ) , so the result holds . Otherwise , let ( m ) be a minimal element ( ( mle z ) for all comparable ( z ) ) and ( M ) be a maximal element ( ( z le M ) for all comparable ( z ) ) . Let ( T = S - m @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ T ) has size ( le d-1 ) , then ( T ) can be covered by ( d-1 ) chains , and so ( S ) can be covered by those plus the chain ( m , M ) , and the result will be proven for ( S ) . <p> So now suppose that the largest antichain in ( T ) has size ( d ) ( it ca n't be larger because ( T ) is a subset of ( S ) ) . Call this antichain ( A ) . <p> The idea of the rest of the proof is : picture the Hasse diagram for ( S ) where the largest antichain consists of a horizontal strip . Take everything below the strip and everything above the strip , use induction to cover these by chains , and then link the chains together by connecting them across the strip . <p> That is , construct the two sets beginalign S+ &amp;= xin Scolon x ge a text for some a in A S- &amp;= xin Scolon x le a text for some a in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all of ( S ) , because if it were n't then ( A ) would not be a maximal antichain in ( S ) . And ( S+ cap S- = A ) , because if ( x ) is in the intersection , then ( a le x le b ) for some elements ( a , b in A ) , so ( a ) and ( b ) are comparable by transitivity , so the only possibility is that ( a=b ) and they both equal ( x ) . <p> Since ( m ) and ( M ) are not in ( A ) , it must be the case that ( m notin S+ ) and ( M notin S- ) , so both sets ) , and the are strictly smaller than ( S ) .

Not all ordered sets have a least element .

A wave is longitudinal when the oscillation occurs in the direction of propagation , or cross when the oscillation occurs in the direction perpendicular to the direction of wave propagation . <h> Contents <h> Propagation Means <p> linear medium : different waves of any particular point of the medium in question can be added ; <p> limited means : if it is finite in extent , otherwise they are considered unlimited ; <p> means uniform : if its physical properties can not be modified in different points ; <p> isotropic media : if its physical properties are the same in any direction . <p> Examples of Waves : <p> Ocean surface waves , which are perturbations that propagate through water ( see also surfing and tsunami ) . <p> Sound , a mechanical wave that propagates through gases , liquids and solids , which is a frequency detected by the auditory system . A similar seismic wave is present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ S , P and L. <p> Light , radio waves , X-ray , etc. are electromagnetic waves . In this case the propagation is possible through a vacuum . <h> Characteristic Properties <p> All waves have common behavior patterns in situations , which can be summarized as the following characteristics : <p> Reflection : When a wave is back to the direction where it came from , due to hit in reflective material . <p> Refraction : The change of the direction of the waves due to entry into another medium . The wave velocity varies as the wavelength also varies , but the frequency remains always the same , which is characteristic of the emitting source . <p> Diffraction : Scattering waves , for example , when crossing a slit equivalent to its wavelength size . High waves with wavelength are diffracted easily . <p> Interference : Addition or subtraction of the amplitudes of the waves depends on the phase of the waves in the superposition occurs . <p> Polarization : The wave may be polarized by using a polarizing filter .

The distance ( y ) is the amplitude of the wave . ) <p> Waves can be described using a number of variables , including the frequency , width and height of the wave , amplitude and period . The amplitude of a wave is a measure of the magnitude of a disturbance in a medium during one cycle of the waveform . For example , waves on a string have their amplitude expressed as a distance ( meters ) , sound waves as pressure ( pascals ) and electromagnetic waves as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The amplitude may be constant ( in this case the wave is a continuous wave ) or may vary with time and/or position . The form of this variation is the envelope of the wave . The period is the time ( ( T ) ) of a complete cycle of an oscillation of a wave . The frequency ( ( F ) ) period is divided by a unit of time ( example : one second ) , and is expressed in hertz . See below : F=dfrac1T . When the waves are expressed mathematically , the angular frequency ( omega ; radians per second ) is constantly used , in connection with frequency ( F ) : F= dfracomega2 pi . <p> Standing Waves and Non-stationary Waves : <p> Waves that remain in place are called paranticas waves , like vibrations on a violin string . <p> When a rope is deformed , the disturbance propagates throughout the cord , reflected in their fixed ends . The interference of several waves could result in a standing wave , or oscillation that appears not to move through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between the crest of two waves and belly . In the antinodes , where the offset is maximum , interference occurs between two crests and two wave antinodes . Each oscillation pattern corresponds to a particular frequency to what is called a harmonic . The vibration frequencies vary with the length of the string and its characteristics ( material , tension , thickness ) , which determine the speed of propagation of waves . At the lowest concentration at which the string vibrates is called the fundamental frequency . <p> Waves moving ( non-stationary ) have a disturbance that varies both with time ( t ) as the distance ( z ) can be expressed mathematically as <p> y=A ( z , t ) cdotcos ( kz-omega t+phi ) , <p> where ( A ( z , t ) ) is the amplitude envelope of the wave , ( k ) is the wave number , and ( phi ) is the phase constant .

@@77511861 @6211861/ 26449 @qwx646449 <h> Contents <h> Electron Shells and Energy Levels <p> In this section we will discuss the energy level of the electron of a hydrogen atom , and how it changes as the electron undergoes transition . According to Bohr 's theory , electrons of an atom revolve around the nucleus on certain orbits , or electron shells . Each orbit has its specific energy level , which is expressed as a negative value . This is because the electrons on the orbit are " captured " by the nucleus via electrostatic forces , and impedes the freedom of the electron . The orbits closer to the nucleus have lower energy levels because they interact more with the nucleus , and vice versa . Bohr named the orbits as textK ( n=1 ) , textL ( n=2 ) , textM ( n=3 ) , textN ( n=4 ) , textO ( n=5 ) , cdots in order of increasing distance from the nucleus . Note that ( n ) refers to the principal quantum number . <p> Imgur <p> The energy of the electron of a monoelectronic atom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The energy level of the electron of a hydrogen atom is given by the following formula , where ( n ) denotes the principal quantum number : En=-frac1312n2text kJ/mol . For a single electron instead of per mole , the formula in eV ( electron volts ) is also widely used : En=-frac13.6n2text eV . <p> Observe that the energy level is always negative , and increases as ( n . ) Since ( n ) can only take on positive integers , the energy level of the electron can only take on specific values such as ( E1=-13.6text eV , ) ( E2=-3.39text eV , ) ( E3=-1.51text eV , cdots ) and so on . Thus , we can say that the energy level of an electron is quantized , rather than continuous . The figure below shows the electron energy level diagram of a hydrogen atom . Observe how the lines become closer as ( n ) increases . <p> Imgur <p> For atoms other than hydrogen , we simply multiply ( -frac1312n2text kJ/mol ) or ( -frac13.6n2text eV ) by ( Ztexteff2 , ) where ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in mind that this rule can only be applied to monatomic atoms ( or ions ) such as ( ceH , ceHe+ , ceLi2+ . ) <h> Find the ionization energy of hydrogen . <p> Ionization energy is the energy needed to take away an electron from an atom . It is equivalent to the energy needed to excite an electron from ( n=1 ) ( ground state ) to ( n=infty , ) which is Einfty-E1=1312text kJ/mol , or Einfty-E1=13.6text eV. square <h> Transition of an Electron and Spectral Lines <p> In chemistry , energy is a measure of how stable a substance is . The lower the energy level of an electron , the more stable the electron is . Thus an electron would be in its most stable state when it is in the K shell ( ( n=1 ) . ) For this reason , we refer to ( n=1 ) as the ground state of the electron . If the electron is in any other shell , we say that the electron is in excited state . <p> It is quite obvious that an electron @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excited . Likewise , an electron at a higher energy level releases energy as it falls down to a lower energy level . Using the formula above , we can calculate how much energy is absorbed/released during the transition of an electron . The energy change during the transition of an electron from ( n=n1 ) to ( n=n2 ) is Delta LONG ... eV . Obviously , a positive energy change means that the electron absorbs energy , while a negative energy change implies a release of energy from the electron . Note that the formula is the energy per mole , rather than that of a single photon . <p> During transition , an electron absorbs/releases energy is in the form of light energy . The energy of the photon ( E ) absorbed/released during the transition is equal to the energy change ( Delta E ) of the electron . Using the properties of DeBroglie waves , we can calculate the wavelength and frequency of the following formula : E=hnu=hfracclambda , where ( h=6.63times10-34text Jcdottexts ) denotes Planck 's constant , ( nu ) denotes frequency , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) denotes the speed of light . Combining this formula with the ( Delta E ) formula above gives the famous Rydberg formula : LONG ... m-1 , where ( R=1.097times107text m-1 ) is the Rydberg constant . Using the Rydberg formula , we can compute the wavelength of the light the electron absorbs/releases , which ranges from ultraviolet to infrared . <p> Because the value of ( frac1n2 ) substantially decreases as ( n ) increases , the value of the energy change or wavelength depends on the smaller between ( n1 ) and ( n2 . ) For this reason , the light emission by the fall of the energy level of an electron can be categorized into several groups . If an electron falls from any ( nge2 ) to ( n=1 , ) then the wavelength calculated using the Rydberg formula gives values ranging from 91 nm to 121 nm , which all fall under the domain of ultraviolet . As this was discovered by a scientist named Theodore Lyman , this kind of electron transition is referred to as the Lyman series . Similarly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) emits visible light , and is known as the Balmer series . Electron transition from ( nge4 ) to ( n=3 ) gives infrared , and this is referred to as the Paschen series . <p> Imgur <p> Since the energy level of the electron of a hydrogen atom is quantized instead of continuous , the spectrum of the lights emitted by the electron via transition is also quantized . In other words , the wavelength ( lambda ) can only take on specific values since ( n1 ) and ( n2 ) are integers . As a result , the electron transition gives spectral lines as shown in the right figure below ( showing only visible light , or Balmer series ) . Note how this differs to the continuous spectrum shown in the left figure below . Running sunlight through a prism would give a continuous spectrum . <p> Imgur <p> When analyzing spectral lines , we must approach them from the right side . This is because the lines become closer and closer as the wavelength decreases within a series , and it is harder to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within a series corresponds to the electron transition with the lowest energy within that series . Hence in the figure above , the red line indicates the transition from ( n=3 ) to ( n=2 , ) which is the transition with the lowest energy within the Balmer series . <p> Recall that the energy level of the electron of an atom other than hydrogen was given by ( En=-frac1312n2cdot Ztexteff2text kJ/mol . ) Since each element has a unique ( Ztexteff ) value , the spectral lines of each element would be different . Therefore spectral lines can be thought of the " fingerprints " of an element , and be used to identify an element . <p> Imgur <p> The figure above shows the spectrum of Balmer series .

The shortest path problem is something most people have some intuitive familiarity with : given two points , A and B , what is the shortest path between them ? In computer science , however , the shortest path problem can take different forms and so different algorithms are needed to be able to solve them all . <p> For simplicity and generality , shortest path algorithms typically operate on some input graph , ( G ) . This graph is made up of a set of vertices , ( V ) , and edges , ( E ) , that connect them . If the edges have weights , the graph is called a weighted graph . Sometimes these edges are bidirectional and the graph is called undirected . Sometimes there can be even be cycles in the graph . Each of these subtle differences are what makes one algorithm work better than another for certain graph type . An example of a graph is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There are also different types of shortest path algorithms . Maybe you need to find the shortest path between point A and B , but maybe you need to shortest path between point A and all other points in the graph . <p> Shortest path algorithms have many applications . As noted earlier , mapping software like Google or Apple maps makes use of shortest path algorithms . They are also important for road network , operations , and logistics research . Shortest path algorithms are also very important for computer networks , like the Internet . <p> Any software that helps you choose a route uses some form of a shortest path algorithm . Google Maps , for instance , has you put in a starting point and an ending point and will solve the shortest path problem for you . <h> Contents <h> Types of Graphs <p> There are many variants of graphs . The first property is the directionality of its edges . Edges can either be unidirectional or bidirectional . If they are unidirectional , the graph is called a directed graph . If they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ graph is called a undirected graph . In the case where some edges are directed and others are not , the bidirectional edges should be swapped out for 2 directed edges that fulfill the same functionality . That graph is now fully directed . <p> The same graph as above , but directed <p> The second property of a graph has to do with the weights of the edges . Edges can have no weight , and in that case the graph is called unweighted . If edges do have weights , the graph is said to be weighted . There is an extra caveat here : graphs can be allowed to have negative weight edges . The inclusion of negative weight edges prohibits the use of some shortest path algorithms . <p> The third property of graphs that affects what algorithms can be used is the existence of cycles . A cycle is defined as any path ( p ) through a graph , ( G ) , that visits that same vertex , ( v ) , more than once . So , if a graph has any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is said to be cyclic . Acyclic graphs , graphs that have no cycles , allow more freedom in the use of algorithms . <p> Cyclic graph with cyclic path A -&gt; E -&gt; D -&gt; B -&gt; A <h> Types of Shortest Path Algorithms <p> There are two main types of shortest path algorithms , single-source and all-pairs . Both types have algorithms that perform best in their own way . All-pairs algorithms take longer to run because of the added complexity . All shortest path algorithms return values that can be used to find the shortest path , even if those return values vary in type or form from algorithm to algorithm . <p> Single-source <p> Single-source shortest path algorithms operate under the following principle : <p> Given a graph ( G ) , with vertices ( V ) , edges ( E ) with weight function ( w ( u , v ) = wu , v ) , and a single source vertex , ( s ) , return the shortest paths from ( s ) to all other vertices in ( V ) . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shortest path between only two given vertices , ( s ) and ( t ) , then the algorithm can simply be stopped when that shortest path is found . Because there is no way to decide which vertices to " finish " first , all algorithms that solve for the shortest path between two given vertices have the same worst-case asymptotic complexity as single-source shortest path algorithms . <p> This paradigm also works for the single-destination shortest path problem . By reversing all of the edges in a graph , the single-destination problem can be reduced to the single-source problem . So , given a destination vertex , ( t ) , this algorithm will find the shortest paths starting at all other vertices and ending at ( t ) . <p> The most common algorithm for the all-pairs problem is the floyd-warshall algorithm . This algorithm returns a matrix of values ( M ) , where each cell ( Mi , j ) is the distance of the shortest path from vertex ( i ) to vertex ( j ) . Path reconstruction is possible to find the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is not part of the fundamental algorithm . <h> Algorithms <p> The Bellman-Ford algorithm solves the single-source problem in the general case , where edges can have negative weights and the graph is directed . If the graph is undirected , it will have to modified by including two edges in each direction to make it directed . <p> Bellman-Ford has the property that it can detect negative weight cycles reachable from the source , which would mean that no shortest path exists . If a negative weight cycle existed , a path could run infinitely on that cycle , decreasing the path cost to ( - infty ) . <p> If there is no negative weight cycle , then Bellman-Ford returns the weight of the shortest path along with the path itself . <p> Dijkstra 's algorithm makes use of breadth-first search ( which is not a single source shortest path algorithm ) to solve the single-source problem . It does place one constraint on the graph : there can be no negative weight edges . However , for this one constraint , Dijkstra greatly improves on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sometimes used to solve the all-pairs shortest path problem by simply running it on all vertices in ( V ) . Again , this requires all edge weights to be positive . <p> Topological Sort <p> For graphs that are directed acyclic graphs ( DAGs ) , a very useful tool emerges for finding shortest paths . By performing a topological sort on the vertices in the graph , the shortest path problem becomes solvable in linear time . <p> A topological sort is an ordering all of the vertices such that for each edge ( ( u , v ) ) in ( E ) , ( u ) comes before ( v ) in the ordering . In a DAG , shortest paths are always well defined because even if there are negative weight edges , there can be no negative weight cycles . <p> The Floyd-Warshall algorithm solves the all-pairs shortest path problem . It uses a dynamic programming approach to do so . Negative edge weight may be present for Floyd-Warshall . <p> Floyd-Warshall takes advantage of the following observation : the shortest path from A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ B plus the shortest path from B to C or it 's the shortest path from A to C that 's already been found . This may seem trivial , but it 's what allows Floyd-Warshall to build shortest paths from smaller shortest paths , in the classic dynamic programming way . <p> While Floyd-Warshall works well for dense graphs ( meaning many edges ) , Johnson 's algorithm works best for sparse graphs ( meaning few edges ) . In sparse graphs , Johnson 's algorithm has a lower asymptotic running time compared to Floyd-Warshall . <p> Johnson 's algorithm takes advantage of the concept of reweighting , and it uses Dijkstra 's algorithm on many vertices to find the shortest path once it has finished reweighting the edges . <p> Shortest-path algorithms are useful for certain types of graphs . For the graph below , which algorithm should be used to solve the single-source shortest path problem ? <p> Oftentimes , the question of which algorithm to use is not left up to the individual ; it is merely a function of what graph is being operated upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For graphs with negative weight edges , the single source shortest path problem needs Bellman-Ford to succeed . For dense graphs and the all-pairs problem , Floyd-Warshall should be used . <p> However , there are some subtle differences .

However , if there are no negative edge weights , then it is actually better to use Dijkstra 's algorithm with binary heaps in the implementation . Running Dijsktra 's from each vertex will yield a better result . <p> From a space complexity perspective , many of these algorithms are the same . In their most fundemental form , for example , Bellman-Ford and Dijkstra are the exact same because they use the same representation of a graph . However , when these algorithms are sped up using advanced data structures like fibonacci or binary heaps , the space required to perform the algorithm increases . As is common with algorithms , space is often traded for speed . <h> Improvements <p> These algorithms have been improved upon over time . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ using a list , and had a runtime of ( O(V2) ) . However , when a binary heap is used , a runtime of ( O ( ( E+V ) cdot log2(V) ) ) has been achieved . When a fibonacci heap is used , one implementation can achieve ( O ( E + V cdot log2(V) ) ) while another can do ( O ( E cdot log2 ( log2 ( C ) ) ) ) where ( C ) is a bounded constant for edge weight . <p> Bellman-Ford has been implemented in ( O ( V2 cdot log2(V) ) ) . This implementation can be efficient if used on the right kind of graph ( sparse ) .

Lines connecting circles indicate dependencies. 1 <p> Artificial neural networks ( ANNs ) are computational models inspired by the human brain . At their core , they are comprised of a large number of connected nodes , each of which performs a simple mathematical operation . Each node 's output is determined by this operation , as well as a set of parameters that are specific to that node . By connecting these nodes together and carefully setting their parameters , very complex functions can be learned and calculated . <p> Artificial neural networks are responsible for many of the recent advances in artificial intelligence , including voice recognition , image recognition , and robotics . For example , ANNs can perform image recognition on hand drawn digits .

Of particular interest were algorithms that could perform online learning , which is a learning method that can be applied to data points arriving sequentially . This is in opposition to batch learning , which requires that all of the data be present at the time of training . <p> Online learning is especially useful in scenarios where training data is arriving sequentially over time , such as speech data or the movement of stock prices . With a system capable of online learning , one does n't have to wait until the system has received a ton of data before it can make a prediction or decision . If the human brain learned by batch learning , then human children would take 10 years before they could learn to speak , mostly just to gather enough speech data and grammatical rules to speak correctly . Instead , children learn to speak by observing the speech patterns of those around them and gradually incorporating that knowledge to improve their own speech , an example of online @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ powerful online learner , it is natural to try to emulate it mathematically . ANNs are one attempt at a model with the bare minimum level of complexity required to approximate the function of the human brain , and so are among the most powerful machine learning methods discovered thus far . <h> Neurons <p> The human brain is primarily comprised of neurons , small cells that learn to fire electrical and chemical signals based on some function . There are on the order of ( 1011 ) neurons in the human brain , about ( 15 ) times the total number of people in the world . Each neuron is , on average , connected to ( 10000 ) other neurons , so that there are a total of ( 1015 ) connections between neurons . <p> Since individual neurons are n't capable of very complicated calculations , it is thought that the huge number of neurons and connections are what gives the brain its computational power . While there are in fact thousands of different types of neurons in the human brain , ANNs usually attempt to replicate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calculation and analysis . <p> The electrical current for a neuron going from rest to firing to rest again. 3 <p> Neurons function by firing when they receive enough input from the other neurons to which they 're connected . Typically , the output function is modeled as an activation function , where inputs below a certain threshold do n't cause the neuron to fire , and those above the threshold do . Thus , a neuron exhibits what is known as all-or-nothing firing , meaning it is either firing , or it is completely off and no output is produced . <p> From the point of view of a particular neuron , its connections can generally be split into two classes , incoming connections and outgoing connections . Incoming connections form the input to the neuron , while the output of the neuron flows through the outgoing connections . Thus , neurons whose incoming connections are the outgoing connections of other neurons treat other neurons ' outputs as inputs . The repeated transformation of outputs of some neurons into inputs of other neurons gives rise to the power of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can create highly complex functions . <p> It turns out that incoming connections for a particular neuron are not considered equal . Specifically , some incoming connections are stronger than others , and provide more input to a neuron than weak connections . Since a neuron fires when it receives input above a certain threshold , these strong incoming connections contribute more to neural firing . Neurons actually learn to make some connections stronger than others , in a process called long-term potentiation , allowing them to learn when to fire in response to the activities of neurons they 're connected to . Neurons can also make connections weaker through an analogous process called long-term depression . <h> Model Desiderata <p> As discussed in the above sections , as well as the later section titled The Universal Approximation Theorem , a good computational model of the brain will have three characteristics : <p> Biologically-Inspired The brain 's computational power is derived from its neurons and the connections between them . Thus , a good computational approximation of the brain will have individual computational units ( a la neurons ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a la connections ) . Specifically , the outputs of some computational units will be the inputs to other computational units . Furthermore , each computational unit should calculate some function akin to the activation function of real neurons . <p> Flexible The brain is flexible enough to learn seemingly endless types and forms of data . For example , even though most teenagers under the age of 16 have never driven a car before , most learn very quickly to drive upon receiving their driver 's license . No person 's brain is preprogrammed to learn how to drive , and yet almost anyone can do it given a small amount of training . The brain 's ability to learn to solve new tasks that it has no prior experience with is part of what makes it so powerful . Thus , a good computational approximation of the brain should be able to learn many different types of functions without knowing the forms those functions will take beforehand . <p> Capable of Online Learning The brain does n't need to learn everything at once , so neither should a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approximation of the brain should be able to improve by online learning , meaning it gradually improves over time as it learns to correct past errors . <p> By the first desideratum , the model will consist of many computational units connected in some way . Each computational unit will perform a simple computation whose output will be passed as input to other units . This process will repeat itself some number of times , so that outputs from some computational units are the inputs to others . With any luck , connecting enough of these units together will give sufficient complexity to compute any function , satisfying the second desideratum . However , what kind of function the model ends up computing will depend on the data it is exposed to , as well as a learning algorithm that determines how the model learns that data . Ideally , this algorithm will be able to perform online learning , the third desideratum . <p> Thus , building a good computational approximation to the brain consists of three steps . The first is to develop a computational model of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way the brain performs computations . This is covered in the sections titled A Computational Model of the Neuron , The Sigmoid Function , and Putting It All Together . The second is to prove that this model is sufficiently complex to calculate any function and learn any type of data it is given , which is covered in the section titled The Universal Approximation Theorem . The third is to develop a learning algorithm that can learn to calculate a function , given a model and some data , in an online manner . This is covered in the section titled Training The Model . <h> A Computational Model of the Neuron <p> As stated above , neurons fire above a certain threshold and do nothing below that threshold , so a model of the neuron requires a function exhibiting the same properties . The simplest function that does this is the step function . <p> In this simple neuron model , the input is a single number that must exceed the activation threshold in order to trigger firing . However , neurons can ( and should , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ multiple incoming neurons , so we need some way of " integrating " these incoming neuron 's inputs into a single number . The most common way of doing this is to take a weighted sum of the neuron 's incoming inputs , so that the neuron fires when the weighted sum exceeds the threshold . If the vector of outputs from the incoming neurons is represented by ( vecx ) , then the weighted sum of ( vecx ) is the dot product ( vecw cdot vecx ) , where ( vecw ) is called the weight vector . <p> To further improve the modeling capacity of the neuron , we want to be able to set the threshold arbitrarily . This can be achieved by adding a scalar ( which may be positive or negative ) to the weighted sum of the inputs . Adding a scalar of ( -b ) will force the neuron 's activation threshold to be set to ( b ) , since the new step function ( H ( x+ ( -b ) ) ) at ( x = b ) equals ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ function . The value ( b ) is known as the bias since it biases the step function away from the natural threshold at ( x = 0 ) . <p> Thus , calculating the output of our neuron model is comprised of two steps : <p> 2 ) Calculate the output . The output is the activation function applied to the result of step 1 . Since the activation function in our model is the step function , the output of the neuron is ( H ( vecw cdot vecx + b ) ) , which is ( 1 ) when ( vecw cdot vecx + b &gt;= 0 ) and ( 0 ) otherwise . <p> Following from the description of step 2 , our neuron model defines a linear classfier , i.e. a function that splits the inputs into two regions with a linear boundary . In two dimensions , this is a line , while in higher dimensions the boundary is known as a hyperplane . The weight vector ( vecw ) defines the slope of the linear boundary while the bias ( b ) defines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ illustrates a neuron 's output for two incoming connections ( i.e. a two dimensional input vector ( vecx ) . Note that the neuron inputs are clearly separated into values of ( 0 ) and ( 1 ) by a line ( defined by ( vecw cdot vecx + b = 0 ) ) . <p> By adjusting the values of ( vecw ) and ( b ) , the step function unit can adjust its linear boundary and learn to split its inputs into classes , ( 0 ) and ( 1 ) , as shown in the previous image . As a corollary , different values of ( vecw ) and ( b ) for multiple step function units will yield multiple different linear classifiers . Part of what makes ANNs so powerful is their ability to adjust ( vecw ) and ( b ) for many units at the same time , effectively learning many linear classifiers simultaneously . This learning is discussed in more depth in the section titled Training the Model . <h> The Universal Approximation Theorem <p> Since the brain can calculate more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggests that connecting many linear classifiers together should produce a nonlinear function . In fact , it is proven that for certain activation functions and a very large number of neurons , ANNs can model any continuous , smooth function arbitrarily well , a result known as the universal approximation theorem . <p> This is very convenient because , like the brain , an ANN should ideally be able to learn any function handed to it . If ANNs could only learn one type of function ( e.g. third degree polynomials ) , this would severely limit the types of problems to which they could be applied . Furthermore , learning often happens in an environment where the type of function to be learned is not known beforehand , so it is advantageous to have a model that does not depend on knowing a priori the form of the data it will be exposed to . <p> Unfortunately , since the step function can only output two different values , ( 0 ) and ( 1 ) , an ANN of step function neurons can not be a universal approximator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two values ) . Luckily , there is a continuous function called the sigmoid function , described in the next section , that is very similar to the step function and can be used in universal approximators . <h> The Sigmoid Function <p> There is a continuous approximation of the step function called the logistic curve , or sigmoid function , denoted as ( sigma(x) ) . This function 's output ranges over all values between ( 0 ) and ( 1 ) and makes a transition from values near ( 0 ) to values near ( 1 ) at ( x = 0 ) , similar to the step function ( H(x) ) . <p> The sigmoid function is defined as : <p> ( sigma(x) = frac11 + e-x ) <p> So , for a computational unit that uses the sigmoid function , instead of firing ( 0 ) or ( 1 ) like a step function unit , it 's output will be between ( 0 ) and ( 1 ) , non-inclusive . This changes slightly the interpretation of this unit as a model of a neuron @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will never take on the value of ( 0 ) ( nothing ) or ( 1 ) ( all ) . However , the sigmoid function is very close to ( 0 ) for ( x lt 0 ) and very close to ( 1 ) for ( x gt 0 ) , so it can be interpreted as exhibiting practically all-or-nothing behavior on most ( ( x notapprox 0 ) ) inputs . <p> The output for a sigmoidal unit with weight vector ( vecw ) and bias ( b ) on input ( vecx ) is : <p> Thus , a sigmoid unit is like a linear classifier with a boundary defined at ( vecw cdot vecx + b = 0 ) . The value of the sigmoid function at the boundary is ( sigma(0) = .5 ) . Inputs ( vecx ) that are far from the linear boundary will be approximately ( 0 ) or ( 1 ) , while those very close to the boundary will be closer to ( .5 ) . <p> The sigmoid function turns out to be a member of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imitates the behavior of real neurons ( by approximating the step function ) while also permitting the possibility of arbitrary function approximation . These happen to be exactly the first two desiderata specified for a good mathematical model of the brain . In fact , some ANNs use activation functions that are different from the sigmoidal function , because those functions are also proven to be in the class of functions for which universal approximators can be built . Two well-known activation functions used in the same manner as the sigmoidal function are the hyperbolic tangent and the rectifier . The proof that these functions can be used to build ANN universal approximators is fairly advanced , so it is not covered here . <p> Calculate the output of a sigmoidal neuron with weight vector ( vecw = ( .25 , .75 ) ) and bias ( b = -.75 ) for the following two inputs vectors : <p> ( vecm = ( 1 , 2 ) ) ( vecn = ( 1 , -.5 ) ) <p> Recalling that the output of a sigmoidal neuron with input ( vecx @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) ) , <p> Like the step function unit describe above , the sigmoid function unit 's linear boundary can be adjusted by changing the values of ( vecw ) and ( b ) . The weight vector defines the slope of the linear boundary while the bias defines the intercept of the linear boundary . Since , like the brain , the final model will include many individual computational units ( a la neurons ) , a learning algorithm that can learn , or train , many ( vecw ) and ( b ) values simultaneously is required . This algorithm is described in the section titled Training the Model . <h> Putting It All Together <p> Neurons are connected to one another , with each neuron 's incoming connections made up of the outgoing connections of other neurons . Thus , the ANN will need to connect the outputs of sigmoidal units to the inputs of other sigmoidal units . <h> One Sigmoidal Unit <p> The diagram below shows a sigmoidal unit with three inputs ( vecx = ( x1 , x2 , x3 ) ) , one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and weight vector ( vecw = ( w1 , w2 , w3 ) ) . Each of the inputs ( vecx = ( x1 , x2 , x3 ) ) can be the output of another sigmoidal unit ( though it could also be raw input , analogous to unprocessed sense data in the brain , such as sound ) , and the unit 's output ( y ) can be the input to other sigmoidal units ( though it could also be a final output , analogous to an action associated neuron in the brain , such as one that bends your left elbow ) . Notice that each component ( wi ) of the weight vector corresponds to each component ( xi ) of the input vector . Thus , the summation of the product of the individual ( wi , xi ) pairs is equivalent to the dot product , as discussed in the previous sections . <h> ANNs as Graphs <p> Artificial neural networks are most easily visualized in terms of a directed graph . In the case of sigmoidal units , node ( s ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diagram above ) and directed edge ( e = ( u , v ) ) indicates that one of sigmoidal unit ( v ) ' s inputs is the output of sigmoidal unit ( u ) . <p> Thus , if the diagram above represents sigmoidal unit ( s ) and inputs ( x1 ) , ( x2 ) , and ( x3 ) are the outputs of sigmoidal units ( a ) , ( b ) , and ( c ) , respectively , then a graph representation of the above sigmoidal unit will have nodes ( a ) , ( b ) , ( c ) , and ( s ) with directed edges ( ( a , s ) ) , ( ( b , s ) ) , and ( ( c , s ) ) . Furthermore , since each incoming directed edge is associated with a component of the weight vector for sigmoidal unit ( s ) , each incoming edge will be labeled with its corresponding weight component . Thus edge ( ( a , s ) ) will have label ( w1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have label ( w2 ) , and ( ( c , s ) ) will have label ( w3 ) . The corresponding graph is shown below , with the edges feeding into nodes ( a ) , ( b ) , and ( c ) representing inputs to those nodes . <p> While the above ANN is very simple , ANNs in general can have many more nodes ( e.g. modern machine vision applications use ANNs with more than ( 106 ) nodes ) in very complicated connection patterns ( see the wiki about convolutional neural networks ) . <p> The outputs of sigmoidal units are the inputs of other sigmoidal units , indicated by directed edges , so computation follow the edges in the graph representation of the ANN . Thus , in the example above , computation of ( s ) ' s output is preceded by the computation of ( a ) , ( b ) , and ( c ) ' s outputs . If the graph above was modified so that 's ( s ) ' s output was an input of ( a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ( a ) would be added , creating what is known as a cycle . This would mean that ( s ) ' s output is dependent on itself . Cyclic computation graphs greatly complicate computation and learning , so computation graphs are commonly restricted to be directed acyclic graphs ( or DAGs ) , which have no cycles . ANNs with DAG computation graphs are known as feedforward neural networks , while ANNs with cycles are known as recurrent neural networks . <p> Ultimately , ANNs are used to compute and learn functions . This consists of giving the ANN a series of input-output pairs ( vec ( xi , vecyi ) ) , and training the model to approximate the function ( f ) such that ( f(vecxi) = vecyi ) for all pairs . Thus , if ( vecx ) is ( n ) -dimensional and ( vecy ) is ( m ) -dimensional , the final sigmoidal ANN graph will consist of ( n ) input nodes ( i.e. raw input , not coming from other sigmoidal units ) representing ( vecx = ( x1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sigmoidal units ( some of which will be connected to the input nodes ) , and ( m ) output nodes ( i.e. final output , not fed into other sigmoidal units ) representing ( vecy = ( y1 , dots , ym ) ) . <p> Like sigmoidal units , output nodes have multiple incoming connections and output one value . This necessitates an integration scheme and an activation function , as defined in the section titled The Step Function . Sometimes , output nodes use the same integration and activation as sigmoidal units , while other times they may use more complicated functions , such as the softmax function , which is heavily used in classification problems . Often , the choice of integration and activation functions is dependent on the form of the output . For example , since sigmoidal units can only output values in the range ( ( 0 , 1 ) ) , they are ill-suited to problems where the expected value of ( y ) lies outside that range . <p> An example graph for an ANN computing a two dimensional output ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ using five sigmoidal units ( s1 , dots , s5 ) is shown below . An edge labeled with weight ( wab ) represents the component of the weight vector for node ( b ) that corresponds to the input coming from node ( a ) . Note that this graph , because it has no cycles , is a feedforward neural network . <p> ANN for three dimensional input , two dimensional output , and five sigmoidal units <h> Layers <p> Thus , the above ANN would start by computing the outputs of nodes ( s1 ) and ( s2 ) given ( x1 ) , ( x2 ) , and ( x3 ) . Once that was complete , the ANN would next compute the outputs of nodes ( s3 ) , ( s4 ) , and ( s5 ) , dependent on the outputs of ( s1 ) and ( s2 ) . Once that was complete , the ANN would do the final calculation of nodes ( y1 ) and ( y2 ) , dependent on the outputs of nodes ( s3 ) , ( s4 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obvious from this computational flow that certain sets of nodes tend to be computed at the same time , since a different set of nodes uses their outputs as inputs . For example , set ( s3 , s4 , s5 ) depends on set ( s1 , s2 ) . These sets of nodes that are computed together are known as layers , and ANNs are generally thought of a series of such layers , with each layer ( li ) dependent on previous layer ( li-1 ) Thus , the above graph is composed of four layers . The first layer ( l0 ) is called the input layer ( which does not need to be computed , since it is given ) , while the final layer ( l3 ) is called the output layer . The intermediate layers are known as hidden layers , which in this case are the layers ( l1 = s1 , s2 ) and ( l2 = s3 , s4 , s5 ) , are usually numbered so that hidden layer ( hi ) corresponds to layer ( li ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hidden layer ( h2=s3 , s4 , s5 ) . The diagram below shows the example ANN with each node grouped into its appropriate layer . <p> The same ANN grouped into layers <h> Training The Model <p> The ANN can now calculate some function ( ftheta(vecx) ) that depends on the values of the individual nodes ' weight vectors and biases , which together are known as the ANN 's parameters ( theta ) . The logical next step is to determine how to alter those biases and weight vectors so that the ANN computes known values of the function . That is , given a series of input-output pairs ( ( vecxi , vecyi ) ) , how can the weight vectors and biases be altered such that ( ftheta(vecxi) approx vecyi ) for all ( i ) ? <h> Choosing an Error Function <p> The typical way to do this is define an error function ( E ) over the set of pairs ( X = ( vecx1 , vecy1 ) , dots , ( vecxN , vecyN ) ) such that ( E ( X , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) for all ( i ) . Common choices for ( E ) are the mean squared error ( MSE ) in the case of regression problems and the cross entropy in the case of classification problems . Thus , training the ANN reduces to minimizing the error ( E ( X , theta ) ) with respect to the parameters ( since ( X ) is fixed ) . For example , for the mean square error function , given two input-output pairs ( X= ( vecx1 , vecy1 ) , ( vecx2 , vecy2 ) ) and an ANN with parameters ( theta ) that outputs ( ftheta(vecx) ) for input ( vecx ) , the error function ( E ( X , theta ) ) is <h> Gradient Descent <p> Since the error function ( E ( X , theta ) ) defines a fairly complex function ( it is a function of the output of the ANN , which is a composition of many nonlinear functions ) , finding the minimum analytically is generally impossible . Luckily , there exists a general method for minimizing differentiable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gradient of a function ( f ) at a particular value ( x ) ( for an ANN , that value will be the parameters ( theta ) ) and then updates that value by moving ( or stepping ) in the direction of the negative of the gradient . Generally speaking ( it depends on the size of the step ( eta ) ) , this will find a nearby value ( xprime = x - eta nabla f(x) ) for which ( f(xprime) lt f(x) ) . This process repeats until a local minimum is found , or the gradient sufficiently converges ( i.e. becomes smaller than some threshold ) . Learning for an ANN typically starts with a random initialization of the parameters ( the weight vectors and biases ) followed by successive updates to those parameters based on gradient descent until the error function ( E ( X , theta ) ) converges . <p> A major advantage of gradient descent is that it can be used for online learning , since the parameters are not solved in one calculation but are instead gradually improved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thus , if input-output pairs are arriving in a sequential fashion , the ANN can perform gradient descent on one input-output pair for a certain number of steps , and then do the same once the next input-output pair arrives . For an appropriate choice of step size ( eta ) , this approach can yield results similar to gradient descent on the entire dataset ( X ) ( known as batch learning ) . <p> Because gradient descent is a local method ( the step direction is determined by the gradient at a single point ) , it can only find local minima . While this is generally a significant problem for most optimization applications , recent research has suggested that finding local minima is not actually an issue for ANNs , since the vast majority of local minima are evenly distributed and similar in magnitude for large ANNs . <h> Backpropagation <p> For a long time , calculating the gradient for ANNs was thought to be mathematically intractable , since ANNs can have large numbers of nodes and very many layers , making the error function ( E @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in the mid-1980s , computer scientists were able to derive a method for calculating the gradient with respect to an ANN 's parameters , known as backpropagation , or " backpropagation by errors " . The method works for both feedforward neural networks ( for which it was originally designed ) as well as for recurrent neural networks , in which case it is called backpropagation through time , or BPTT . The discovery of this method brought about a renaissance in artificial neural network research , as training non-trivial ANNs had finally become feasible .

@@77511872 @6211872/ <h> Partial Derivatives 26449 @qwx646449 <p> The partial derivative of a function of multiple variables is the instantaneous rate of change or slope of the function in one of the coordinate directions . Computationally , partial differentiation works the same way as single-variable differentiation with all other variables treated as constant . <p> The partial derivative of a function ( f ( x , y ) ) in the ( x ) -direction can be considered as the usual derivative of the single-variable function ( f(x) ) formed by intersecting ( f ) with the plane of constant ( y ) at any given point . One particular plane of constant ( y ) and the resulting single-variable function ( in red ) are shown above . <h> Definition <p> Extending this definition to more than two variables is straightforward : all variables besides the variable in the derivative are held fixed in the definition above . The same holds true for partial derivatives in directions other than the ( x ) -direction : for instance , for the partial derivative in the ( y ) -direction the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ f ( x , y+h ) ) . Note that this definition is the usual difference quotient defining the slope of a tangent line , except with the extra variables held fixed . <p> Notation for the partial derivative varies significantly depending on context . A frequently used shorthand notation in physics for the left-hand side above includes ( partialx f ) , while mathematicians will often write ( fx ) ( although this can be ambiguous ) . In contexts where ( f ( x , t ) ) is a function of space ( x ) and time ( t ) , the dot derivative ( dotf ) will typically denote the partial derivative with respect to time ( partialt ) while the prime derivative ( fprime ) will typically denote the partial derivative with respect to space ( partialx ) . <p> All of the usual rules for the ordinary single-variable derivative carry over in the case of partial derivatives : <p> Since the quotient rule and other rules such as the power rule , rules for differentiating logarithms and trig functions , etc. can be derived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ listed separately , but all such rules still hold . <h> Compute the partial derivative in the ( y ) -direction of <p> f ( x , y ) = sin ( xy ) <p> first directly from the definition and second by treating the partial derivative as an ordinary derivative with all other variables held constant . <p> in agreement with the first approach . This example demonstrates that the second approach ( treating all variables not involved in the derivative as constant ) is typically more expedient than computing the partial derivative directly from the definition . The original function ( f ( x , y ) = sin ( xy ) ) and its partial derivative ( partialy f ) are graphed below for illustration : <p> The definition above is written for the three-dimensional case , but the generalization to arbitrary dimensions ( including only two dimensions ) is straightforward ; each component of the vector is a partial derivative in an independent coordinate direction . The operator ( vecnabla ) is often called the gradient operator or the del operator . It can be treated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rightmost expression is another way of writing the second partial derivative with respect to ( x ) . If the two derivative operators are not the same , the higher-order partial derivative is called a mixed partial derivative : <p> At the origin , ( partial2xy f ) corresponds to ( partialx ) of ( partialy f ) , i.e. a derivative of ( partialy f ) taken along the ( x ) axis . Similarly , ( partial2yx f ) corresponds to ( partialy ) of ( partialx f ) , i.e. a derivative of ( partialx f ) taken along the ( y ) axis . Since only the restrictions of the first derivatives to the coordinate axes matter for computation of the second derivatives at the origin , the expressions above suffice . The mixed partial derivatives are therefore : <p> partial2xy = 1 neq partial2yx = -1 , <p> so the partial derivatives in the ( x ) and ( y ) directions do not commute . <p> The fact that this a consequence of the failure of the mixed partial derivatives to be continuous can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : <p> The different values of the mixed second partial derivatives correspond to the different limits of the expression for the mixed second partial derivative when approaching the origin from different directions . <p> Just as the first-order partial derivatives could be arranged to form a vector ( the gradient ) , the second-order partial derivatives can be arranged as a matrix called the Hessian matrix : <p> The determinant of the Hessian is important in characterizing stability of critical points where one of the first-order partial derivatives vanish , similar to the use of the second derivative test in single-variable calculus . <p> What is the determinant of the Hessian matrix corresponding to the function : <p> f ( x , y ) = frac12 big(x2+y2big)2 ? <p> 12(x2+y2)2 x2+y2 4 x4+y4 - 4xy <h> Total Derivatives and Fixed Quantities <p> When dealing with functions of multiple variables , one often sees derivatives written with ( d ) instead of ( partial ) . These derivatives are called total derivatives and are distinct from partial derivatives . For instane , consider a function ( f ( x , t @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ position . Since ( x ) itself is time-dependent , the time-dependence of ( f ) depends not only on the explicit form of ( f ( x , t ) ) but also on the path ( x(t) ) . This fact is captured by the total derivative : <p> There is an additional ( sin ( 2t ) ) term from the time-dependence of ( x ) that is not present in just the partial derivative with respect to ( t ) . <p> Usually when computing partial derivatives it is assumed that all coordinate directions but one are held fixed . However , in some cases ( especially in thermodynamics ) , the quantity that is held fixed for a partial derivative is some combination of the other coordinate variables ( like the entropy of an ideal gas , which is a function of temperature and volume ) . The notation for a partial derivative of a function ( f ) with respect to the coordinate ( x ) holding the quantity ( y ) fixed is : <p> This identity generalizes to cyclic products of ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by ( ( -1 ) n ) . <h> The heat capacity of an ideal gas is defined as the partial derivative of heat input with respect to temperature change . That is , the heat capacity quantifies how responsive the temperature of an ideal gas is to addition of heat . However , depending on how the system is externally maintained , the heat capacity may take different values . Two standard definitions are the heat capacity at constant volume ( CV ) and the heat capacity at constant pressure ( CP ) , defined by : <p> This result provides concrete physical proof that the quantity held fixed in computing a partial derivative matters . <h> Partial Differential Equations <p> Partial derivatives in mathematics and the physical sciences are often seen in partial differential equations , differential equations containing more than one partial derivative .

It corresponds to the stoichiometric coefficients only for an elementary reaction ( a reaction which occurs in just one step ) . A complex reaction occurs in a series of elementary reactions ( multiple steps ) . Some steps are very fast as they do not require much energy . These steps do not affect the overall rate of reaction . Hence the rate of reaction is mainly determined by the slowest step of the reaction .

@@77511877 @6211877/ 26449 @qwx646449 <p> A randomized algorithm is a technique that uses a source of randomness as part of its logic . It is typically used to reduce either the running time , or time complexity ; or the memory used , or space complexity , in a standard algorithm . The algorithm works by generating a random number , ( r ) , within a specified range of numbers , and making decisions based on ( r ) ' s value . <p> A randomized algorithm could help in a situation of doubt by flipping a coin or a drawing a card from a deck in order to make a decision . Similarly , this kind of algorithm could help speed up a brute force process by randomly sampling the input in order to obtain a solution that may not be totally optimal , but will be good enough for the specified purposes . <p> A superintendent is attempting to score a high school based on several metrics , and she wants to do so from information gathered by confidentially interviewing students . However , the superintendent has to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so interviewing every single student would take a time she can not afford . What should she do ? <p> The superintendent should employ a randomized algorithm , where , without knowing any of the kids , she 'd select a few at random and interview them , hoping that she gets a wide variety of students . This technique is more commonly known as random sampling , which is a kind of randomized algorithm . Of course , she knows that there are diminishing returns from each additional interview , and should stop when the quantity of data collected measures what she was trying to measure to an acceptable degree of accuracy . The way that the superintendent is determining the score of the school can be thought of as a randomized algorithm . <h> Contents <h> Definitions of a Randomized Algorithm <p> Randomized algorithms are used when presented with a time or memory constraint , and an average case solution is an acceptable output . Due to the potential erroneous output of the algorithm , an algorithm known as amplification is used in order to boost the probability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the randomized algorithm several times with different random subsamples of the input , and comparing their results . It is common for randomized algorithms to amplify just parts of the process , as too much amplification may increase the running time beyond the given constraints . <p> Randomized algorithms are usually designed in one of two common forms : as a Las Vegas or as a Monte Carlo algorithm . A Las Vegas algorithm runs within a specified amount of time . If it finds a solution within that timeframe , the solution will be exactly correct ; however , it is possible that it runs out of time and does not find any solutions . On the other hand , a Monte Carlo algorithm is a probabilistic algorithm which , depending on the input , has a slight probability of producing an incorrect result or failing to produce a result altogether . <p> Practically speaking , computers can not generate completely random numbers , so randomized algorithms in computer science are approximated using a pseudorandom number generator in place of a true source of random number , such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Intuitive Explanation <p> The game , Wheel of Fortune , can be played using a Monte Carlo randomized algorithm . Instead of mindfully choosing letters , a player ( or computer ) picks randomly letters to obtain a solution , as shown in the image below . The more letters a player reveals , the more confident a player becomes in their solution . However , if a player does not guess quickly , the chance that other players will guess the solution also increases . Therefore , a Monte Carlo algorithm is given a deterministic amount of time , in which it must come up with a " guess " based on the information revealed ; the best solution it can come up with . This allows for the possibility of being wrong , maybe even a large probability of being wrong if the Monte Carlo algorithm did not have sufficient time to reveal enough useful letters . But providing it with a time limit controls the amount of time the algorithm will take , thereby decreasing the risk of another player guessing and getting the prize . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ game differs from a standard Monte Carlo algorithm as the game has one correct solution , whereas for a Monte Carlo algorithm , the ' good enough ' solution is an acceptable output . <p> Wheel of Fortune Board . When should you stop revealing letters and guess the word ? <p> The term for this algorithm , Monte Carlo , was coined by mathematicians Nicholas Metropolis , Stanislaw Ulam , and John von Neumann , working on the Manhattan Project , around the 1940s . The name was found in a research paper published in 1949 , attributed by some sources to the fact that Ulam 's uncle made a yearly trip to gamble at Monte Carlo , in Monaco . 1 <p> Technical Example : Approximating ( pi ) <p> A classic example of a more technical Monte Carlo algorithm lies in the solution to approximating pi , ( pi ) , the ratio of a circle 's circumference to its diameter . This approximation problem is so common that it 's actually asked in job interviews for programmer positions at big banks and other mathematically rigorous companies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to find the shape of an object . Intuitively , the solution would be to touch the object in as many places as possible until a familiar object come to mind , at which point you make a guess . The same strategy is applied when approximating ( pi ) . <p> Start with a Cartesian plane ( x , y coordinates ) with an x-axis from ( -1 ) to ( 1 ) , and a y-axis from ( -1 ) to ( 1 ) . This will be a ( 2 times 2 ) box . Then generate many random points on this grid . Count the number of points , C , that fall within a distance of ( 1 ) from the origin ( ( 0 , 0 ) ) , and the number of points , T , that do n't . For instance , ( ( 0.5,0 ) ) is less than ( 1 ) from the origin , but ( ( -0.9 , 0.9 ) ) is ( sqrt(1.62) ) from the origin , by the pythagorean theorem . <p> We can now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a circle to the area of the rectangular bounds should be equal to the ratio of points inside the circle to those outside the circle ; namely , <p> ( fracpi r24r2 approx ( fracCT ) ) <p> This leads to the conclusion that as more random samples are obtained , the approximation to ( pi ) is improved , as shown below . <h> Las Vegas Algorithms <p> Intuition <p> A Las Vegas algorithm is a randomized algorithm that always produces a correct result , or simply does n't find one , yet it can not not guarantee a time constraint ; the time complexity varies on the input . It does , however , guarantee an upper bound in the worst-case scenario . <p> Las Vegas algorithms occur almost every time people look something up . Think of a Las Vegas algorithm as a task that when the solution is found , it has full confidence that it is the correct solution , yet the path to get there can be murky . As an extremely generalized and simplified example , a Las Vegas algorithm could be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ searches for something online . Since searching every single website online is extremely inefficient , the user will generally use a search engine to get started . The user will then surf the web until a website is found which contains exactly what the user is looking for . Since clicking through links is a decently randomized process , assuming the user does not know exactly what 's contained on the website at the other end of the , the time complexity ranges from getting lucky and reaching the target website on the first link , to being unlucky and spending countless hours to no avail . What makes this a Las Vegas algorithm is that the user knows exactly what she is looking for , so once the website is found , there is no probability of error . Similarly , if the user 's allotted time to surf the web is exceeded , she will terminate the process knowing that the solution was not found . <p> The term for this algorithm , Las Vegas , is attributed to mathematician Laszlo Babai , who coined it in 1979 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ algorithm , as both are major world gambling centers . However , the gambling styles of the two have nothing to do with the styles of the algorithms , as it can not be said that gambling in Las Vegas always gives a correct , or even positive , turnout . 3 <p> Randomized Quicksort <p> A common Las Vegas randomized algorithm is quicksort , a sorting algorithm that sorts elements in place , using no extra memory . Since this is a comparison based algorithm , the worst case scenario will occur when performing pairwise comparison , taking ( O(n2) ) , where the time taken grows as a square of the number of digits to be sorted grows . However , through randomization , the runtime of this algorithm can be reduced up to ( O ( n log(n) ) ) . <p> Quicksort applies a divide-and-conquer paradigm in order to sort an array of numbers , ( A ) . It works in three steps : it first picks a pivot element , ( Aq ) , using a random number generator ( hence a randomized algorithm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ap dots q-1 ) and ( Aq+1 dots r ) , where the elements in the first and second arrays are smaller and greater than ( Aq ) , respectively . <p> Array A sorted and partitioned around pivot element q . <p> The algorithm then recursively applies the above steps of quicksort on the two independent arrays , thereby outputting a fully sorted array . <p> Pseudocode <p> 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 <p> INPUT : Array A of n elements def Randomizedquicksort(A) : If n = 1 : return A # A is sorted . Else : i = Random number in range ( 1 , n ) X = Ai # the pivot element Partition A into elements &lt; x , x , and &gt;x # as shown in the figure above . Execute Quicksort on A1 to i-1 and Ai+1 to n . Combine the responses in order to obtain a sorted array . <p> In the worst case scenario , this algorithm takes O(n2) time to sort ( n ) digits in case the pivot element chosen at random @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The following is a time complexity analysis for the worst-case scenario of quicksort . Since each insertion and removal takes ( O(1) ) time , and partitioning takes ( O(n) ) time , as every item must be iterated over to create both subarrays , if the smallest or the largest elements in the array are picked , the partition will result in two arrays : one of size 0 , since there will be no items at one extreme of the array , and an array of size ( O(n-1) ) ; excluding the pivot element chosen . Therefore , the runtime analysis is the following : <p> Now , using randomized quicksort , where the pivot is chosen at random , and neither the smallest or the largest number in the array are selected , the expected runtime is ( O ( n log(n) ) ) . <p> If luck is on the algorithm 's side and middle valued elements are picked each time , the array will constantly be partitioned in half , obtaining the following time complexity : <p> ( T(n) leq 2*T(fracn2) + Theta(n) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) <p> However , the probability that this happens is one out of ( n ) numbers , which is extremely small . However , what if we get a 10%-90% split instead of a 50% , 50% , as shown above ? The algorithm still works ! This is because the depth of the recursion tree will still be ( O ( log ( n ) ) ) , and it takes ( O(n) ) to perform one level of the recursion tree . Therefore , randomizing quicksort gives a great advantage to sorting an array of numbers . <h> Atlantic City Algorithms <p> Monte Carlo algorithms are always fast and probably correct , whereas Las Vegas algorithms are sometimes fast but always correct . There is a type of algorithm that lies right in the middle of these two , and it is called the Atlantic City algorithm .

Of course , a brute force solution , where all the possible number combinations are executed , would output the correct answer , but she knows this is an assignment problem , and the complexity of these kinds of problems is in the non-deterministic polynomial , NP , space . To make her algorithm faster , she starts thinking of other methods involving randomized algorithms techniques , keeping in mind that the solutions produced must always be correct . Of the following strategies , which should she explore ? <p> Sudoku puzzles can be solved by computers using a variety of strategies <h> Image Credit : Flickr Ferdinand . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ algorithm An Atlantic City randomized algorithm None of the above will be faster than brute force <h> Computational Complexity <p> Randomized algorithms have a complexity class of their own , since they operate under Probabilistic Turing Machines . The most basic probabilistic complexity class is called RP , randomized polynomial time algorithms , which encompass problems with an efficient randomized algorithm , taking polynomial time , and recognizes bad solutions with absolute certainty , and correct solutions with probability of at least -+ . <p> Amplification can be used with RP algorithms in order to increase the probability that the correct answer is recognized . Since said recognition occurs with probability -+ , the algorithm can be repeated ( n ) times in order to obtain the correct solution with probability 1- ( ( frac12 ) n ) times . Therefore , if an RP algorithm is executed 100 times , the chance of obtaining a wrong answer every time is lower than the chance that cosmic rays corrupted the memory of the computer running the algorithm ! This makes RP algorithms extremely practical . 4 <p> The complement of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are accepted with absolute certainty , but if the answer is incorrect , the algorithm has ( frac12 ) probability of outputting no . <p> Randomized algorithms with polynomial time runtime complexity , whose output is always correct , are said to be in ZPP , or zero-error probabilistic polynomial time algorithms . ZPP , then , are Las Vegas algorithms which are both in RP and in co-RP . Lastly , the class of problems for which both YES and NO-instances are allowed to be identified with some error , commonly known as Monte Carlo algorithms , are in the complexity class called BPP , bounded-error probabilistic polynomial time . <p> Derandomization <p> It is worth mentioning that a considerable amount of mathematicians and theoreticians are working on producing an efficient derandomization process , whereby all the randomness is removed from an algorithm while keeping runtimes the same . Although a few techniques have been developed , whether ( P = BPP ) , where ( P ) is a polynomial-time algorithm , is still an open problem .

The following are a few common randomized algorithms encountered in many popular computer science and math courses , as well as common software and hardware programs encountered on a daily basis . <p> Primality Testing <p> Testing whether a number is prime or composite has been a problem spanning several centuries , and is still a problem today as modern cryptographic techniques securing important information , amongst many other techniques , depend on it . <p> Primality Testing was one of the first randomized algorithms formally developed in the 1970s , however , the idea spans as far back as the 1600s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compute powers of integers with modulo prime numbers . <p> Randomized algorithms are used to perform primality testing in order to avoid a brute force search , which would consist of a time consuming linear search of every prime number leading up to the number at hand . <p> Randomized Minimum Cut <p> The Max-Flow Min-cut algorithm is another basic randomized algorithm applied on network flow and general graph problems . The goal is to find the smallest total weight of edges which , if removed , would disconnect the source from the sink in a max-flow network problem . Due to the fact that every edge must be checked in order to confidently assure that the right answer is found , randomized algorithms are developed in order to expedite the process by acknowledging that there is a slight probability that the algorithm outputs an incorrect answer .

Since matrix multiplication is a rather costly process and checking the stated equality would require term-by-term comparisons of both sides of the equation , randomized algorithms have been developed in order to avoid this brute force method of checking the equality . The most famous algorithm is named after Rusins Frievalds , who realized that by using randomization , he could reduce the running time of this problem from brute force matrix multiplication using Strassen 's algorithm , taking a runtime of ( O(n2.37) ) , to ( O ( k n2 ) ) , where k is the number of times the algorithm is executed . Although Frievald 's algorithm is fast , it is performed assuming a probability of failure of less than ( 2-k ) .

The idea is that this halo fails to exist precisely when the point lies on the boundary of the set , so the condition that ( U ) is open is the same as saying that it does n't contain any of its boundary points .

There are a total of ( n+k-1 ) positions , of which ( n ) are stars and ( k-1 ) are bars . Thus , the number of ways to place ( n ) indistinguishable balls into ( k ) labeled urns is the same as the number of ways of choosing ( n ) positions among ( n+k-1 ) spaces for the stars , with all remaining positions taken as bars . The number of ways this can be done is ( binomn+k-1n. ) ( square ) <p> Note : ( binomn+k-1n = binomn+k-1k-1 ) can be interpreted as the number of ways to instead choose the positions for ( k-1 ) bars and take all remaining positions to be stars . <p> Check out the following example : <h> How many ordered sets of non-negative integers ( ( a , b , c , d ) ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ + d = 10 ? <p> We first create a bijection between the solutions to ( a+b+c +d = 10 ) and the sequences of length 13 consisting of 10 ( 1 ) ' s and 3 ( 0 ) ' s . In other words , we will associate each solution with a unique sequence , and vice versa . <p> Conversely , given a sequence of length 13 that consists of 10 ( 1 ) ' s and 3 ( 0 ) ' s , let ( a ) be the length of the initial string of ( 1 ) ' s ( before the first ( 0 ) ) , let ( b ) be the length of the next string of 1 's ( between the first and second ( 0 ) ) , let ( c ) be the length of the third string of ( 1 ) ' s ( between the second and third ( 0 ) ) , and let ( d ) be the length of the last string of ( 1 ) ' s ( after the third ( 0 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equation ( a + b + c + d = 10 ) . <p> This construction associates each solution with a unique sequence , and vice versa , and hence gives a bijection . <p> Now that we have a bijection , the problem is equivalent to counting the number of sequences of length 13 that consist of 10 ( 1 ) ' s and 3 ( 0 ) ' s , which we count using the stars and bars technique . There are ( 13 ) positions from which we choose ( 10 ) positions as 1 's and let the remaining positions be 0 's . By stars and bars , there are ( 13 choose 10 = 13 choose 3 = 286 ) different choices . ( square ) <h> Problem Solving <h> Find the number of non-negative integer solutions to a+b+c+d+e+f=23 . <p> We have ( 6 ) variables , thus ( 5 ) plus signs .

To translate this into a stars and bars problem , we consider writing 5 as a sum of 26 integers ( cA , cB , ldots cY , ) and ( cZ , ) where ( cA ) is the number of times letter ( A ) is chosen , ( cB ) is the number of times letter ( B ) is chosen , etc . <p> Thus , ( n ) = 5 and ( k ) = 26 . <p> Then by stars and bars , the number of 5-letter words is <p> binom26 +5 -15 = binom3025 = 142506. square <p> For some problems , the stars and bars technique does not apply immediately . In these instances , the solutions to the problem must first be mapped to solutions of another problem which can then be solved by stars and bars .

If you are unfamiliar with any of the terms , you can refer to the Fixed Income Glossary . <p> A bond is a kind of loan , made from one party ( the issuer ) to another ( the holder ) . It is a debt security , in which the issuer owes the holder a debt , and is obliged to pay them interest ( based on the coupon of the bond ) , and repay the principal ( face value ) at a later date , known as the maturity date . Generally , the maturity date of a bond exceeds a year . Interest is typically paid at fixed intervals ( either annually , semiannually , or monthly ) . <p> Bonds typically trade in the secondary market , and thus ownership is transferable .

Bonds are risk-free while stocks have risk . Bonds pay a stated par value on a stated maturity , while stocks do not guarantee returns . Bond prices are fixed while stock prices are fluctuating . <h> Features of a bond <p> Numerous features of the bond are fixed in advance , and the standardization of the contract allows for it to be easily traded in the market .

Medium : Notes mature between 6 to 12 years . Long : Bonds mature in more than 12 years . <h> Coupon <p> The coupon is the interest rate that the issuer has to pay to the holder . A zero coupon bond is a bond that pays no coupons . A fixed coupon bond is a bond that pays a fixed amount per time period . A floating rate bond is a bond that pays a ( fixed ) spread above a money market reference rate . For example , a USD LIBOR + 0.20% bond will pay out more as the LIBOR rate increases .

@@77511895 @6211895/ 26449 @qwx646449 <p> Gaussian Mixture Models are a probabilistic model for representing normally distributed subpopulations within an overall population . Mixture models in general do n't require knowing which subpopulation a data point belongs to , allowing the model to learn the subpopulations automatically . Since subpopulation assignment is not known , this constitutes a form of unsupervised learning . <p> For example , in modeling human height data , height is typically modeled as a normal distribution for each gender with a mean of approximately 5 ' 10 " for males and 5 ' 5 " for females . Given only the height data and not the gender assignments for each data point , the distribution of all heights would follow the sum of two scaled ( different variance ) and shifted ( different mean ) normal distributions . A model making this assumption is an example of a Gaussian Mixture Model ( GMM ) , though in general , a GMM may have more than two components . Estimating the parameters of the individual normal distribution components is a canonical problem in modeling data with GMMs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ follow a mixture model is that the data looks multimodal , i.e. there is more than one " peak " in the distribution of data . Trying to fit a multimodal distribution with a unimodal ( one " peak " ) model will generally give a poor fit , as shown in the example below . Since many simple distributions are unimodal , an obvious way to model a multimodal distribution would be to assume that it is generated by multiple unimodal distributions . For several theoretical reasons , the most commonly used distribution in modeling real world unimodal data is the Gaussian distribution . Thus , modeling multimodal data as a mixture of many unimodal Gaussian distributions makes intuitive sense . Furthermore , GMMs maintain many of the theoretical and computational benefits of Gaussian models , making them practical for efficiently modeling very large datasets . <p> ( Left ) Fit with one Gaussian distribution ( Right ) Fit with Gaussian mixture model with two components <h> The Model <p> A Gaussian mixture model is parameterized by two types of values , the mixture component weights and the component @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( K ) components , the ( kth ) component has a mean of ( muk ) and variance of ( sigmak ) for the univariate case and a mean of ( vecmuk ) and covariance matrix of ( Sigmak ) for the multivariate case . The mixture component weights are defined as ( phik ) for component ( Ck ) , with the constraint that ( sumi=1Kphii = 1 ) so that the total probability distribution normalizes to ( 1 ) . If the component weights are n't learned , they can be viewed as an a-priori distribution over components such that ( p ( x text generated by component Ck ) = phik ) . If they are instead learned , they are the a-posteriori estimates of the component probabilities given the data . <h> Learning the Model <p> If the number of components ( K ) is known , expectation maximization is the technique most commonly used to estimate the mixture model 's parameters . In frequentist probability theory , models are typically learned by using maximum likelihood estimation techniques , which seek to maximize the probability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ model parameters . Unfortunately , finding the maximum likelihood solution for mixture models by differentiating the log likelihood and solving for ( 0 ) is usually analytically impossible . <p> Expectation maximization ( EM ) is an numerical technique for maximum likelihood estimation , and is usually used when closed form expressions for updating the model parameters can be calculated ( which will be shown below ) . Expectation maximization is an iterative algorithm and has the convenient property that the maximum likelihood of the data strictly increases with each subsequent iteration , meaning it is guaranteed to approach a local maximum or saddle point . <h> EM for Gaussian Mixture Models <p> Expectation maximization for mixture models consists of two steps . <p> The first step , known as the Expectation , or E , step , consists of calculating the expectation of the component assignments ( Ck ) for each data point ( xi in X ) given the model parameters ( phik ) , ( muk ) , and ( sigmak ) . <p> The second step is known as the Maximization , or M , step @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ E step with respect to the model parameters . This step consists of updating the values ( phik ) , ( muk ) , and ( sigmak ) . <p> The entire iterative process repeats until the algorithm converges , giving a maximum likelihood estimate . Intuitively , the algorithm works because knowing the component assignment ( Ck ) for each ( xi ) makes solving for ( phik ) , ( muk ) , and ( sigmak ) easy , while knowing ( phik ) , ( muk ) , and ( sigmak ) makes inferring ( p(Ckxi) ) easy . The expectation step corresponds to the latter case while the maximization step corresponds to the former . Thus , by alternating between which values are assumed fixed , or known , maximum likelihood estimates of the non-fixed values can be calculated in an efficient manner . <p> The EM algorithm updating the parameters of a two component bivariate Gaussian mixture model. 2 <h> Algorithm for Univariate Gaussian Mixture Models <p> The expectation maximization algorithm for Gaussian mixture models starts with an initialization step , which assigns model parameters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the model iterates over the Expectation ( E ) and Maximization ( M ) steps until the parameters ' estimates converge , i.e. for all parameters ( thetat ) at iteration ( t ) , ( thetat-thetat-1 le epsilon ) for some user-defined tolerance ( epsilon ) . A graphic of the EM algorithm in action for a two component , bivariate Gaussian mixture model is displayed on the right . <p> The EM algorithm for a univariate Gaussian mixture model with ( K ) components is described below . A variable denoted ( hattheta ) denotes an estimate for the value ( theta ) . All equations can be derived algebraically by solving for each parameter as outlined in the section above titled EM for Gaussian Mixture Models . <p> When the number of components ( K ) is not known a priori , it is typical to guess the number of components and fit that model to the data using the EM algorithm . This is done for many different values of ( K ) . Usually , the model with the best trade-off between fit and number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kept . <p> The EM algorithm for the multivariate case is analogous , though more complicated and so it is not expounded here . <h> Unsupervised Learning <p> Once the EM algorithm has run to completion , the fitted model can be used to perform various forms of inference . The two most common forms of inference done on GMMs are density estimation and clustering . <p> Clustering using a Gaussian mixture model . Each color represents a different cluster according to the model. 3 <h> Density Estimation <p> Since the GMM is completely determined by the parameters of its individual components , a fitted GMM can give an estimate of the probabilities of both in-sample and out-of-sample data points , known as density estimation . Furthermore , since numerically sampling from an individual Gaussian distribution is possible , one can easily sample from a GMM to create synthetic datasets . <p> Sampling from a GMM consists of the following steps : <p> 1 . Sample the Gaussian component according to the distribution defined by ( p(Cs) = phis ) 2 . Sample ( x ) from the distribution for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by ( mathcalN ( x ; ; mus , sigmas ) ) <h> Clustering <p> Using Bayes theorem and the estimated model parameters , one can also estimate the a posteriori component assignment probability . Knowing that a data point is likely from one component distribution versus another provides a way to learn clusters , where cluster assignment is determined by the most likely component assignment . Clustering has many uses in machine learning , ranging from tissue differentiation in medical imaging to customer segmentation in market research . <p> Given a univariate model 's parameters , the probability that a data point ( x ) belongs to component ( Ci ) is calculated using Bayes ' Theorem : <h> Recent Applications <p> GMMs have been used recently for feature extraction from speech data for use in speech recognition systems4 . They have also been used extensively in object tracking of multiple objects , where the number of mixture components and their means predict object locations at each frame in a video sequence5 . The EM algorithm is used to update the component means over time as the video frames update , allowing object tracking .

@@77511898 @6211898/ <p> Why some people say it 's true : because infinity is the number which is bigger than all of the other numbers . <p> Why some people say it 's false : because infinity is not a number and the number line does n't have an end . <p> The statement is ( colorredtextbffalse ) . <p> Proof : <p> The misconception at work here is that " if you keep continuing up along the number line past bigger and bigger counting numbers , then , eventually the counting numbers just give up ( somewhere after the point where your teacher gets tired of making tic marks ) , and there will be an infinity sign ( ( infty ) ) there to mark the end of the number line . " Alternatively , some say that , " infinity is at the end of the number line , but there are still infinitely many numbers less than infinity and between infinity and any other point on the line . " Both of these notions have roots in calculus-related concepts , however they are both fundamentally incorrect . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with ( infty ) , this is actually a misleading shorthand for representing that the number line goes on forever . A less misleading way to represent this notion might be to extend the number line out with an arrow . We might additionally indicate that the whole numbers continue after we decide to stop recording them by using the common general-term series notation : " ( ... n , n+1 , n+2 , ... ) " to describe , in this case , the set of all non-negative , whole numbers . This set is also commonly known as the " natural numbers ( ( mathbbN ) ) or as the " non-negative integers . " <p> The misconception is in choosing to treat ( infty ) as an integer or whole number or as one of the real numbers . This is not the same as believing that ( infty ) is " real " or " unreal " in the English sense of the word . Infinity is a " real " and useful concept . However , infinity is not a member of the mathematically defined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is not a number on the real number line . <p> The set of real numbers , ( mathbbR ) , is explained instead of defined in most pre-collegiate schools .

" <p> Most students are not taught a rigorous definition of the real numbers unless they become math majors at a university . One of the most common definitions to learn then , is that the real numbers are as the set of Dedekind cuts of the rational numbers . Given any rigorous definition of the real numbers , it is immediately apparent that " infinity " is not a member of the set of real numbers . <p> Rebuttal : In the study if limits , infinity ( ( infty ) ) is treated just like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calculus if infinity is n't actually a number ? <p> Reply : Many are taught about limits in precalculus or calculus exactly as you describe , and the way infinity is treated does , misleadingly , suggest that infinity is just another number . For example , given a function with a horizontal asymptote at 5 , we might say that the limit of ( f(x) ) as ( x ) approaches infinity is five : ( f(x)xrightarrow infty = 5 ) , and if ( f(x) ) has a vertical asymptote at ( 17 ) , we are taught to say that ( f(x)xrightarrow 17 = infty ) . This is many students first exposure to ( infty ) , and , it 's a very misleading introduction , since it implies that ( infty ) can be treated as a number which is simply " larger than all other numbers .

For example , in the cardinal number set , infinity is actually a measure of how many real numbers there are . However , the set of real numbers , ( mathbbR ) is defined so that it omits any version of infinity . <p> Additionally , when considering the cardinal numbers , we must change our intuition about infinity : it is not a number in the " number line " sense , as the reals are applied .

@@77511906 @6211906/ <h> Complex Numbers in Geometry 26449 @qwx646449 <p> In plane geometry , complex numbers can be used to represent points , and thus other geometric objects as well such as lines , circles , and polygons . They are somewhat similar to cartesian coordinates , in the sense that they are used to algebraically prove geometric results , but they are especially useful in proving results involving circles and/or regular polygons ( unlike Cartesian coordinates , which are useful for proving results involving lines ) . <h> Contents <h> Basics <p> A point in the plane can be represented by a complex number z = x + yi which corresponds to the Cartesian point ( ( x , y ) ) . Therefore , the ( x ) -axis is renamed the real axis and the ( y ) -axis is renamed the imaginary axis , or imaginary line . This can also be converted into a polar coordinate ( ( r , theta ) ) , which represents the complex number <p> ( r , theta ) = reitheta <p> which , intuitively speaking , means rotating the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of ( theta ) about the origin . By Euler 's formula , this is equivalent to <p> ( r , theta ) = reitheta=rcostheta + risintheta <p> which means that the polar coordinate ( ( r , theta ) ) corresponds to the Cartesian coordinate ( rcostheta , rsintheta ) . <p> Incidentally , this immediately illustrates why complex numbers are so useful for circles and regular polygons : these involve heavy use of rotations , which are easily expressed using complex numbers . In particular , <p> A rotation of ( theta ) about the origin sends ( z rightarrow zeitheta ) for all complex numbers ( theta ) . <p> Additionally , each point ( z=a+bi ) has an associated conjugate ( overlinez=a-bi ) . It satisfies the properties <p> ( **31;1835;TOOLONG ) <p> ( overlinewz=overlinew cdot overlinez ) <p> ( z2=z cdot overlinez ) <p> Geometrically , the conjugate can be thought of as the reflection over the real axis . This implies two useful facts : if ( z ) is real , ( z = overlinez ) , and if ( z ) is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lines in complex geometry <p> In this , and following sections , a capital letter denotes a point and the analogous lowercase letter denotes the complex number associated with it <p> Though lines are less nice in complex geometry than they are in coordinate geometry , they still have a nice characterization : <p> The points ( A , B , C ) are collinear if and only if ( fraca-bb-c ) is real . Equivalently , if and only if LONG ... <p> There are two similar results involving lines . One for parallel lines : <p> Lines ( AB ) and ( CD ) are parallel if and only if ( fraca-bc-d ) is real . Equivalently , if and only if ( **26;1868;TOOLONG = **26;1896;TOOLONG ) . <p> Lines ( AB ) and ( CD ) are perpendicular if and only if ( fraca-bc-d ) is pure imaginary . Equivalently , if and only if ( **26;1924;TOOLONG = **27;1952;TOOLONG ) . <p> Additionally , there is a nice expression of reflection and projection in complex numbers : <p> Let ( W ) be the reflection of ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LONG ... and the projection of ( Z ) onto ( AB ) is ( fracw+z2 ) . <p> Let ( m ) be a line in the complex plane defined by : <p> ( 1-i ) z+ ( 1+i ) overlinez =4 <p> Let ( z1=2+2i ) be a point in the complex plane . <p> If the reflection of ( z1 ) in ( m ) is ( z2 ) , then compute the value of : <p> overlinez1(1+i)+z2(1-i) <p> However , it is easy to express the intersection of two lines in Cartesian coordinates .

The projection of ( z ) onto ( AB ) is thus ( **25;1981;TOOLONG ) . <h> Triangle centers <p> Triangles in complex geometry are extremely nice when they can be placed on the unit circle ; this is generally possible , by setting the triangle 's circumcircle to the unit circle . This immediately implies the obvious result that <p> Suppose ( A , B , C ) lie on the unit circle .

Then the orthocenter of ( ABC ) is ( a+b+c ) . <p> Proof : <p> Let ( h = a + b +c ) .

The first is the tangent line through the unit circle : <p> Let ( W ) lie on the unit circle .

Their tangents meet at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( x ) and ( y ) . <p> Proof : <p> Let ( Z ) be the intersection point . Then ( z+x2overlinez=2x ) and ( z+y2overlinez=2y ) , so ( x2-y2 ) overlinez=2(x-y) implies ( x+y ) overlinez=2 implies overlinez=frac2x+y Thus , LONG ... Since ( x , y ) lie on the unit circle , ( overlinex=frac1x ) and ( overliney=frac1y ) , so ( z=frac2xyx+y ) as desired . <p> Points ( A , B , C , D ) lie on a circle if and only if LONG ... is real . <h> Illustrative problems <p> This section contains olympiad problems as examples , using the results of the previous sections . <p> A point A is taken inside a circle . For every chord of the circle passing through A , consider the intersection point of the two tangents at the endpoints of the chord . Find the locus of these intersection points . <p> Solution : <p> WLOG assume that ( A ) is on the real axis . Let ( P , Q ) be the endpoints of a chord passing through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tangents through ( p ) and ( q ) intersect at ( **26;2008;TOOLONG ) . It is also true , since ( P , A , Q ) are collinear , that <p> Now note that LONG ... so ( z ) must lie on the vertical line through ( frac1a ) . <p> For any point on this line , connecting the two tangents from the point to the unit circle at ( P ) and ( Q ) allows the above steps to be reversed , so every point on this line works ; hence , the desired locus is this line . More formally , the locus is a line perpendicular to ( OA ) that is a distance ( frac1OA ) from ( O ) .

Then ( 1,3,5in mathcalF ) is the event which can be described as " an odd number is rolled " .

This is explored further in Option Value , which explains the intrinsic and extrinsic value of an option . <p> A call option gives the buyer the right to buy the asset at a certain price , hence he would benefit as the price of the underlying goes up .

@@77511917 @6211917/ 26449 @qwx646449 <p> The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle is a relationship between certain types of physical variables like position and momentum , which roughly states that you can never simultaneously know both variables exactly . Informally , this means that both the position and momentum of a particle in quantum mechanics can never be exactly known . <p> Mathematically , the Heisenberg uncertainty principle is a lower bound on the product of uncertainties of a pair of conjugate variables . The most well-known expression takes the position and momentum to be the conjugate variables : <p> sigmax sigmap geq frachbar2 . <p> Suppose the position of a particle is known to very high precision , so that ( sigmax ) is very small . Then the uncertainty principle shows that ( sigmap ) must be large , i.e. the momentum is not known precisely .

For example , the wavefunction of a free particle is : <p> Therefore , the position-space wavefunction ( Psi ( x , t ) ) is indeed the Fourier transform of another wavefunction that is dependent on momentum instead . This wavefunction , ( Phi ( p , t ) ) , is called the momentum-space wavefunction . <p> The momentum-space wavefunction can be recovered given the position-space wavefunction by taking the inverse Fourier transform : <p> This Fourier analysis achieves the interesting result of displaying the direct relationship between two variables ( x ) and ( p ) that describe the same wave-packet in different spaces . In this example , a free particle is measured in the position space by ( Psi ( x , t ) ) , but measured in the momentum space @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Regardless of which space one chooses to measure the particle , the physics does n't change . Therefore , this relationship of conjugate variables allows one to measure particles in physical experiments in two ways . In fact , much of crystallography and solid-state physics relies on measurements made in momentum space in lieu of position space . <h> Derivation of the Uncertainty Principle <p> The standard deviation ( sigmax ) of some variable ( x ) is defined by <p> The uncertainty principle holds for any quantum mechanical state ( Psirangle ) . To derive the uncertainty principle thus requires consideration of the expectation value of ( ( x - langle x rangle ) 2 ) in some arbitrary state ( Psirangle ) .

Note that no part of the above derivation uses the fact that ( x ) and ( p ) represent position and momentum , only the fact that they are conjugate variables . Therefore , the above inequality holds for any two conjugate variables . <p> The canonical commutation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ above and taking the square root yields the most well-known form of the Heisenberg uncertainty principle : <p> sigmaxsigmap ge frachbar2 . <p> Which of the following gives the correct lower bound ( B ) in the uncertainty relation for the operators ( hatx ) and ( hatp2 ) ? <h> Generalization : Energy-Time Uncertainty <p> Another uncertainty relation which is often referenced in discussion of quantum mechanics is the energy-time uncertainty principle , <p> sigmaE sigmat geq frachbar2 . <p> It is tempting to interpret this equation as the statement that a system may fluctuate in energy by an arbitrarily large amount over a sufficiently short time scale . This explanation is often given as a description for particle-antiparticle production and annihilation , where a particle and its antiparticle appear spontaneously from the vacuum briefly via " borrowed " energy before colliding and returning to vacuum . However , this explanation is not very precise and the given inequality is not so well-defined in quantum mechanics despite the nice physical interpretation . The reason it is not well-defined is because there is no operator in quantum mechanics corresponding to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operator corresponding to energy . Nevertheless , as explained in this section , there is some way to make sense of an energy-time uncertainty principle by considering how the measurement of an arbitrary operator changes in time . <p> Since time is not an operator , it is unclear how time enters quantum mechanics at all . The answer is that time is incorporated into the Schr+dinger equation , where it describes the time rate of change of a wavefunction . Physically , the passage of time is recorded by noting that certain physical observables are changing over time : for instance , perhaps the position of a particle is changing , which one interprets as motion over time , or the momentum of a particle is changing , which one interprets as accelerating or decelerating over time . <p> To quantify this statement , consider the Ehrenfest theorem governing the dynamics of the expectation value of an operator ( hatA ) in terms of the commutator with the Hamiltonian : <p> Assuming that ( hatA ) does not depend explicitly on time ( which is typically the case ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ( leftlangle lefthatH , hatArightrightrangle ) is generally nonzero . Therefore , ( hatH ) and ( hatA ) satisfy the generalized Heiseinberg uncertainty relation : <p> In other words , ( sigmat ) corresponds to the time it takes the measured value of ( leftlangle hatA rightrangle ) to shift by ( sigmaA ) , for any operator ( hatA ) . <p> Given this definition , substituting in yields the relation : <p> sigmaH sigmat geq frachbar2 , <p> which is a more rigorous expression of the energy-time uncertainty principle . Formally , using the definition of ( sigmat ) one can see that if the energy changes slowly , the rate of change of all expectation values of any observable operator must also be slow . This makes sense because if the energy ( i.e. , the Hamiltonian ) changes slowly , the wavefunction itself that is evolved by the Hamiltonian changes slowly , so the expectation value of observables corresponding to measurements of that wavefunction must change slowly as well . <p> Suppose an exotic particle with a very large mass of ( 20 pm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Collider .

@@77511923 @6211923/ <h> Electric Flux <h> Quiz 26449 @qwx646449 <p> Coulomb 's law provides a way to obtain the electric field produced by a collection of charges . However , summing Coulomb 's law over various continuous distributions of charge can be daunting and complicated . Instead of approaching things one point charge at a time , one can tackle the equivalent problem of determining the charge distribution in a region based on the electric field in that region . Naturally , the more charge in a region bounded by a box , the more electric field lines one would expect to pass through the box . Thus , one would expect some relationship between the regional charge distribution and the electric field . <p> In describing a region of a field , which assigns a magnitude and direction " in other words , a vector " to each point in space , it makes sense to draw an analogy with water currents . The electric field vectors that pass through a surface in space can be likened to the flow of water through a net . The greater the magnitude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are against ( perpendicular to ) the surface , the greater the flow , or flux . This analogy forms the basis for the concept of electric flux . <h> Contents <h> Definition of Electric Flux <p> A flux through a given surface can be " inward " or " outward " depending on which way counts as " in " or " out " " that is , flux has a definite orientation . <p> For a closed surface ( a surface with no holes ) , the orientation of the surface is generally defined such that flux flowing from inside to outside counts as positive , outward flux , while flux from the outside to the inside counts as negative , inward flux . To remember this choice of orientation , we divide the closed surface into many small patches of surface and assign a vector ( mathbfai ) to each small patch of surface that indicates the normal ( perpendicular ) to the surface . In addition , the magnitude of each ( mathbfai ) is defined to be the area of the corresponding patch . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small , then the electric field ( mathbfEi ) at all points on each patch essentially becomes constant . In that case , the electric flux ( Phitextpatch ) through the patch is given by the dot product , which calculates the component of ( mathbfEi ) parallel to ( mathbfai ) : <p> Phitextpatch = mathbfEi cdot mathbfai <p> The total electric flux through the entire surface , meanwhile , is the sum over all patches : <p> Phi = sumi mathbfEi cdot mathbfai . <p> As the ( mathbfai ) become vanishingly small , as in the case of a continuous surface , the sum is replaced with a surface integral : <p> Phi = intS mathbfE cdot dmathbfa . <p> The " ( S ) " in the limits of integration indicates that the integral is to be taken across the entire surface for all infinitesimal surface elements ( d mathbfa ) . Fortunately , the electric flux can often be computed without resorting to computing the integral explicitly . <p> Compute the electric flux across a spherical surface of radius ( R ) that contains a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this case , the electric field is the same at all points on the surface . Furthermore , the field is always perpendicular to the surface . Therefore , the perpendicular component of the electric field summed across the entire surface is simply the electric field at a distance ( R ) from the charge multiplied by the area of the surface . Thus <p> Compute the electric flux across a cube of side length ( s ) placed ( a ) perpendicular to and ( b ) ( 45circ ) with respect to a uniform electric field of magnitude ( E ) as shown . <p> If the cube is placed parallel to the field , then the four faces parallel to the field have zero flux . Of the two faces with nonzero flux , one face contains flux ( -E s2 ) ( " inward " flux ) while the other contains flux ( E s2 ) ( " outward " flux ) . Therefore , the total flux is zero . <h> Qualitative Statement of Gauss ' Law <p> In the example of the flux through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ radius of the sphere . In that case , the total flux depended only on the charge contained inside the sphere . This makes sense intuitively ; as the sphere grows larger , the sphere captures " more " electric field , but this always accompanies a concomitant decrease in field strength . The factors of ( R2 ) growth and ( 1/R2 ) decay exactly cancel out . <p> The same , it turns out , holds for other surfaces as well . If the walls of a box containing a charge are expanded , the total flux through the box remains the same , as the increased number of field lines captured by the expanded walls is exactly canceled by a decrease in field strength farther from the walls . <p> But what if the box contains no charge ? In the case of the cube , no matter how the cube was oriented , the total electric flux always came out to zero . Although the flux through some sides of the cube was positive ( e.g. , " outward " flux ) , it was always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cube ( e.g. , " inward " flux ) . <p> Based these two observations , one might conjecture that flux is always independent of the dimensions of the containing surface and depends only on the magnitude of the total charge enclosed . This forms the basis for Gauss ' law , which holds that the total electric flux through a surface is proportional to the enclosed charge . Furthermore , on the basis of the example of the spherical surface , for which the total electric flux was ( q/epsilon0 ) , the constant of proportionality must be ( 1/epsilon0 ) . <p> A more detailed discussion of Gauss ' law can be found in the accompanying page . <p> A charge ( q ) is split by one face of a cube . What is the total electric flux through the cube ? <p> It is not easy to compute the electric flux directly using the definition .

@@77511924 @6211924/ <h> Quiz 26449 @qwx646449 <p> The Doppler effect causes a wave to be received with a frequency different from the one with which it is emitted as a result of the motion of the emitter and/or receiver . The effects are most commonly studied in sound waves and light waves . <p> It is noticeable when a train or a car passes by while emitting a horn sound . As it approaches , its horn sounds higher in pitch . However , as it leaves , the sound of the horn apparently has a lower pitch . This is because , when the observer and source approach each other , the frequency increases , but when they recede away , the frequency decreases . The true frequency ( or emitted frequency ) of the horn is actually somewhere between the " approach " and " recede " frequencies . <p> The wave fronts in front of the source become close together , meaning a stationary observer on the right side of the . gif receives an effectively higher pitch . 1 <h> Contents <h> Formulation of the Doppler Effect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imagine a boat that is lying at anchor in a gentle sea where the waves have a time period of T = 3.0 sec . This means that every 3.0 second a crest hits the boat . The following figure shows this situation , with the water waves moving toward the left . If a watch is set to t = 0 just as one crest hits , the watch will read 3.0 sec when the next crest hits and 6.0 sec when the third crest hits , and so on . <p> A person in a boat with water waves moving towards him <p> From these observations , it can be concluded that the wave frequency is f = 1/T = 1/ ( 3.0 s ) = 0.33 Hz . Now suppose the boat is headed directly into the incoming waves . Again , the watch is set to t = 0 as a crest hits the front of the boat . Now , however , because the boat is moving towards the next wave crest as it moves toward the boat , it hits the boat in less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words , this period observed is shorter than the 3.0 s period observed when the boat was stationary . Because f = 1/T , a higher wave frequency is observed than when the boat was at rest . <p> Boat moving towards the water waves <p> If the boat is turned around and move in the same direction as the waves , the opposite effect is observed . The watch is set to t = 0 as a crest hits the back of the boat . Because the boat is now moving away from the next crest , more than 3.0 s will elapse on the watch by the time that crest catches the boat . Thus , a lower frequency than when you were at rest will be observed . <p> Boat moves in the direction of water waver and water waves hit the boat from behind <p> These effects occur because the relative speed between the boat and the waves depends on the direction of travel and on the speed of the boat . When the boat is moving towards the right , this relative speed is higher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the observation of an increased frequency . When the boat is turned around and move to the left , the relative speed is lower , as is the observed frequency of the water waves . <p> Let us now examine a situation with sound waves . In this case , an observer O is moving and a sound source S is stationary . For simplicity , we assume that the air is also stationary and that the observer moves directly toward the source . The observer moves with a speed ( vo ) toward a stationary point source ( vs = 0 ) , where stationary means at rest with respect to the medium , air . <p> If a point source emits sound waves and the medium is uniform , the waves move at the same speed in all directions radially away from the source ; such wave is called as spherical wave . It is useful to represent these waves with a series of circular arcs concentric with the source , as in the figure . Each arc represents a surface over which the phase of the wave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the crests of all waves . We call such a surface of constant phase a wavefront . The distance between adjacent wave fronts equals the wavelength ( lambda ) . In the figure , the circles are the intersections of these three-dimensional wave fronts with the two-dimensional paper . <p> We take the frequency of the source in figure to be ( f ) , the wavelength to be ( lambda ) , and the speed of sound to be ( v ) . If both the observer and the source are stationary , then he or she would detect wave fronts at rate ( f ) . ( That is , when ( vo=0 ) and ( vs = 0 ) , the observed frequency is the same as the emitted frequency . ) <p> An observer , moving towards a stationary sound source , notices an increase in frequency <p> When the observer moves toward the source , the speed of the waves relative to the observer is ( v ' = v + vo ) , as in the case of the boat . What about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consecutive crests . The observer will find the relative distance between the received crests is still ( lambda ) ; only this distance is covered at a faster rate and in lesser time as the observer himself is travelling towards these crests . Thus , the wavelength ( lambda ) remains unchanged . Hence , using an equation v = flambda , we can say that the frequency ( f ' ) heard by the observer is increased and is given by f ' = fracv ' lambda = fracv + volambda . Because ( v = f lambda ) , we can express ( f ' ) as f ' = left ( fracv + vov right ) f , where the observer is moving toward the source . <p> If the observer is moving away from the source , the speed of the wave relative to the observer decreases and ( v ' = v - vo ) . The frequency heard by the observer in this case is decreased and is given by f ' = left ( fracv - vov right ) f . <p> In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vo ) relative to a stationary source , the frequency heard by the observer is given by ( f ' = left ( fracv + vov right ) f ) with the following sign convention : a positive value is substituted for ( vo ) when the observer moves toward the source , and a negative value is substituted when the observer moves away from the source . <p> Now consider the situation in which the source is in motion and the observer is at rest . There are two observers ( A ) and ( B ) along the same line of motion of the source , and the source moves towards ( A ) and away from ( B. ) Let the source emit a crest at ( t=0 . ) This crest moves in all directions and expands radially with speed ( v ) . The source is also moving with speed ( vs . ) After a time period ( t=T , ) the source emits another crest . At this instant in time the first crest has traveled a distance ( vT ) and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ observer ( A ) will notice the distance between the two crests to be decreasing and observer ( B ) will notice the distance between the two crests to be increasing . <p> When the source moves away from a stationary observer , as in the case for observer ( B ) in the figure , the observer measures a wavelength ( lambda ' ' ) that is greater than ( lambda ) and hears a decreased frequency : f ' ' = left ( fracvv + vs right ) f , where the source moving away from the observer . <p> Finally , we find the following general relationship for the observed frequency : f ' = left ( fracv + vov - vs right ) f . In this expression , the signs for the values substituted for ( vo ) and ( vs ) depend on the direction of the velocity . A positive value is used for motion of the observer or the source toward the other , and a negative sign for motion of one away from the other . <p> The driver of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) towards a hill sounds a horn of frequency ( 600text Hz . ) If the velocity of the sound in air is ( 330text ms-1 , ) then the frequency ( in ( textHz ) ) of the reflected sound as heard by the driver is ( text . ) <p> A boy is standing in front of a stationary train .

By measuring the change in frequency of the rebounded wave , the speed of the vehicle can be measured . <p> 2 ) Meteorologists use a similar principle to read weather events . In this case , the stationary transmitter is located in a weather station and the moving object being studied is a storm system . <p> 3 ) Doppler echo-cardiogram : A traditional echo-cardiogram uses sound waves to produce images of the heart . The image produced by an echo-cardiogram shows the edges of heart structures , but it can not measure the speed of blood flowing through the heart . Doppler techniques must be incorporated to provide this additional information . In a Doppler echo-cardiogram , sound waves of a certain frequency are transmitted into the heart . The sound waves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vessels . The movement of these cells , either toward or away from the transmitted waves , results in a frequency shift that can be measured . This helps cardiologists determine the speed and direction of blood flow in the heart . <p> 4 ) Astronomers use Doppler effect to determine the movements of stars and planets which because of their far off distances from us and the consequent smallness of the parallactic angles are very difficult to measure . Any star or planet receding away from earth shows a decrease in frequency or increase in wavelength often called as red shift . The star or planet which is moving closer to earth shows increase in frequency or decrease in wavelength known as blue shift .

Although the solution to this problem can be solved quickly without any efficient algorithms , problems of this type can get rather complicated as the number of nodes increases , such as in a social network . <h> Contents <h> Definitions and Terminology <p> Matching <p> Given a graph ( G = ( V , E ) ) , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ P ) , where every node has a degree of at most 1 . The matching consists of edges that do not share nodes . <p> Maximal matching <p> A matching , ( P ) , of graph , ( G ) , is said to be maximal if no other edges of ( G ) can be added to ( P ) because every node is matched to another node . In other words , if an edge that is in ( G ) and is not in ( P ) is added to ( P ) , it would cause ( P ) to no longer be a matching graph , as a node will have more than one edge incident to it . ( P ) is also a maximal matching if it is not a proper subset of any other matching in ( G ) ; if every edge in ( G ) has a non-empty intersection with at least one edge in ( P ) 3 . Note that a maximal matching is not necessarily the subgraph that provides the maximum number of matches possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matching if it is a matching that contains the largest possible number of edges matching as many nodes as possible . Simply stated , a maximum matching is the maximal matching with the maximum number of edges . Every maximum matching is maximal , but not every maximal matching is a maximum matching . <p> In weighted graphs , sometimes it is useful to find a matching that maximizes the weight . <p> A group of students are being paired up as partners for a science project . Each student has determined his or her preference list for partners , ranking each classmate with a number indicating preference , where 20 is the highest ranking one can give a best friend , and rankings can not be repeated as there are 21 students total . The teacher decides to model this problem as a graph by making an edge between each student , assigning a weight to each edge equal to the average of each student 's ranking of each other . The teacher realizes that in order to maximize the class ' overall happiness , she must find the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matchings can also be performed if the purpose of a maximal matching is to minimize the overall weight of the graph ; if the teacher in the example above asked students to rank their best friends in ascending order . <p> A graph may contain more than one maximum matching if the same maximum weight is achieved with a different subset of edges . The size , or total weight , of the maximum matching in a graph is called the matching number . <p> A perfect matching is a matching where every vertex is connected to exactly one edge ; where the matching matches all vertices in the graph . In an unweighted graph , every perfect matching is a maximum matching and is , therefore , a maximal matching as well . If the graph is weighted , there can be many perfect matchings of different matching numbers . Formally speaking , a matching of a graph ( G = ( V , E ) ) is perfect if it has ( fracV 2 ) edges . <p> A near-perfect matching , on the other hand , can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vertices . In this case , it is clear that a perfect matching as described above is impossible as one node will be left unmatched . This scenario also results in a maximum matching for a graph with an odd number of nodes . <p> Which of the following graphs exhibits a perfect matching ? ( the matching is indicated in red ) <h> Bipartite Matching <p> In order to model matching problems more clearly , graphs are usually transformed into bipartite graph , where its vertex set is divided into two disjoint sets , ( V1 ) and ( V2 ) , where ( V = V1 cup V2 ) and all edges connect vertices between ( V1 ) and ( V2 ) . <p> A bipartite graph is represented by grouping vertices into two disjoint sets , ( U ) , and ( V ) . 6 <p> Find a matching graph within the bipartite graph above . <p> Here 's one possible matching in the graph . Another matching may be present " remember it is any subgraph where each of the vertices in the subgraph has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a near-perfect matching since only one vertex is not included in the matching , but remember a matching is any subgraph of a graph where any node in the subgraph has one edge coming out of it . <p> The purpose of the stable marriage problem is to facilitate matchmaking between two sets of people . Given a list of potential matches among an equal number of brides and grooms , the stable marriage problem gives a necessary and sufficient condition on the list for everyone to be married to an agreeable match .

In fact , notice that four of the children , Alice , Charles , Danielle , and Edward , only want one of the first three gifts , which makes it clear that the problem is impossible and one of them will be stuck with a gift they will not enjoy . <p> It turns out , however , that this is the only way for the problem to be impossible . As long as there is n't a subset of children that collectively like fewer gifts than there are children in the subset , there will always be a way to give everyone something they want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Vertex cover , sometimes called node cover , is a famous optimization problem that uses matching . For a graph ( G = ( V , E ) ) , a vertex cover is a set of vertices ( V ' in V ) such that every edge in the graph has at least one endpoint that is in ( V ' ) . Below are two graphs and their vertex cover sets represented in red . Basically , a vertex cover " covers " all of the edges . <p> The vertex covers above do not contain the minimum number of vertices for a vertex cover7 <p> An art museum is filled with famous paintings so security must be airtight . It is of paramount importance to assure nobody can steal these expensive artworks , so the security personnel must install security cameras to closely monitor every painting .

The optimal transport plan ensures that each factory will supply exactly one store and each store will be supplied by exactly one factory and that the overall cost of transporting computers from factories to stores is minimized . This problem is equivalent to finding a minimum weight matching in a bipartite graph . The graph is bipartite because there are ( n ) factories and ( n ) stores , and the weighted edges between the stores and factories are the costs of moving computers between those nodes .

Moreover , the thin layer of water can be taken to have negligible mass . Thus , even on addition of water , the normal force will remain the same . <p> However , if the water level gets more than the cube 's height , the normal force will increase due to the weight of the water column above the cube . <p> and 4 .

In this page we will discuss the IUPAC naming of alkanes , branched-chain alkanes , alkanes with substituents , and cycloalkanes . <h> Basic principles of nomenclature of organic compounds <p> In organic chemistry , a number of prefixes , suffixes and infixes are used to describe the type and position of functional groups in the compound . <p> The steps for naming an organic compound are as follows : <p> Identification of the parent hydrocarbon chain . This chain must obey the following rules , in order of precedence : It should have the maximum number of substituents of the suffix functional group . By suffix , it is meant that the parent functional group should have a suffix , unlike halogen substituents . If more than one functional group is present , the one with highest precedence should be used . <p> a ) It should have the maximum number of multiple bonds . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ single bonds . <p> c ) It should have the maximum length . <p> Identification of the parent functional group , if any , with the highest order of precedence . <p> Identification of the side-chains . Side chains are the carbon chains that are not in the parent chain , but are branched off from it . <p> Identification of the remaining functional groups , if any , and naming them by their ionic prefixes ( such as hydroxy for -OH , oxy for =O , oxyalkane for O-R , etc . ) . <p> Different side-chains and functional groups will be grouped together in alphabetical order . ( The prefixes di- , tri- , etc. are not taken into consideration for grouping alphabetically . For example , ethyl comes before dihydroxy or dimethyl , as the " e " in " ethyl " precedes the " h " in " dihydroxy " and the " m " in " dimethyl " alphabetically . The " di " is not considered in either case ) . When both side chains and secondary functional groups are present , they should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two separate groups . <p> Identification of double/triple bonds . <p> Numbering of the chain . This is done by first numbering the chain in both directions ( left to right and right to left ) , and then choosing the numbering which follows these rules , in order of precedence . <p> a ) Has the lowest-numbered locant ( or locants ) for the suffix functional group . Locants are the numbers on the carbons to which the substituent is directly attached . <p> b ) Has the lowest-numbered locants for multiple bonds ( The locant of a multiple bond is the number of the adjacent carbon with a lower number ) . <p> c ) Has the lowest-numbered locants for prefixes . <p> Numbering of the various substituents and bonds with their locants . If there is more than one of the same type of substituent/double bond , a prefix is added showing how many there are ( di " 2 tri " 3 tetra " 4 then as for the number of carbons below with ' a ' added ) . <p> The numbers for that type @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ written before the name of the side-chain . If there are two side-chains with the same alpha carbon , the number will be written twice . Example : 2,2,3-trimethyl- . If there are both double bonds and triple bonds , " en " ( double bond ) is written before " yne " ( triple bond ) . When the main functional group is a terminal functional group ( a group which can only exist at the end of a chain , like formyl and carboxyl groups ) , there is no need to number it . <p> ( a ) Arrangement in this form : Group of side chains and secondary functional groups with numbers made in step 3 + prefix of parent hydrocarbon chain ( eth , meth ) + double/triple bonds with numbers ( or " ane " ) + primary functional group suffix with numbers . Wherever it says " with numbers , " it is understood that between the word and the numbers , the prefix ( di- , tri- ) is used . <p> ( b ) Adding of punctuation : Commas are put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are put between a number and a letter ( 236 trimethylheptane should become 2,3,6-trimethylheptane ) . Successive words are merged into one word ( trimethyl heptane becomes trimethylheptane ) . <h> Naming of Straight-chain Alkanes <p> First one must memorize the names of straight-chain alkanes . Straight-chain alkanes are alkanes with one straight chain of carbon atoms , i.e. no branches . <h> Naming of Branched-chain Alkanes <p> To name branched-chain alkanes , first the parent chain must be identified . The parent chain is the longest straight chain of carbon atoms within the compound . <h> Naming of Alkanes with Substituents <p> In order to name organic compounds you must first memorize a few basic names . These names are listed within the discussion of naming alkanes . In general , the base part of the name reflects the number of carbons in what you have assigned to be the parent chain . The suffix of the name reflects the type(s) of functional group(s) present on ( or within ) the parent chain . Other groups which are attached to the parent chain are called substituents . <p> Alkanes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hydrocarbons for up to a 12 carbon chain are shown below . The names of the substituents formed by the removal of one hydrogen from the end of the chain is obtained by changing the suffix -ane to -yl . <p> Here is a simple list of rules to follow . Some examples are given at the end of the list . <p> Identify the longest carbon chain .

The prefixes di- and tri- are used if two or three of the alkyl groups are the same . NOTE : Some books put spaces between the parts of the name , but we will not . Follow the examples . <h> Naming of Cycloalkanes <p> Many organic compounds found in nature or created in a laboratory contain rings of carbon atoms with distinguishing chemical properties ; these compounds are known as cycloalkanes . Cycloalkanes only contain carbon-hydrogen bonds and carbon-carbon single bonds , but in cycloalkanes , the carbon atoms are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Figure 1 : The first four cycloalkanes <p> If you count the carbons and hydrogens , you will see that they no longer fit the general formula CnH2n+2CnH2n+2 . By joining the carbon atoms in a ring , two hydrogen atoms have been lost . The general formula for a cycloalkane is CnH2nCnH2n . Cyclic compounds are not all flat molecules . All of the cycloalkanes , from cyclopentane upwards , exist as " puckered rings " . Cyclohexane , for example , has a ring structure that looks like this : <p> Figure 2 : This is known as the " chair " form of cyclohexane from its shape , which vaguely resembles a chair . Note : The cyclohexane molecule is constantly changing , with the atom on the left , which is currently pointing down , flipping up , and the atom on the right flipping down . During this process , another ( slightly less stable ) form of cyclohexane is formed known as the " boat " form . In this arrangement , both of these atoms are either pointing up or down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cyclic hydrocarbons , cycloalkanes may have multiple substituents or functional groups that further determine their unique chemical properties . The most common and useful cycloalkanes in organic chemistry are cyclopentane and cyclohexane , although other cycloalkanes varying in the number of carbons can be synthesized . Understanding cycloalkanes and their properties are crucial in that many of the biological processes that occur in most living things have cycloalkane-like structures . <p> Although polycyclic compounds are important , they are highly complex and typically have common names accepted by IUPAC . However , the common names do not generally follow the basic IUPAC nomenclature rules . The general formula of the cycloalkanes is CnH2nCnH2n where nn is the number of carbons . The naming of cycloalkanes follows a simple set of rules that are built upon the same basic steps in naming alkanes . Cyclic hydrocarbons have the prefix " cyclo- " . <p> Parent Chains For simplicity , cycloalkane molecules can be drawn in the form of skeletal structures in which each intersection between two lines is assumed to have a carbon atom with its corresponding number of hydrogens . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gif same as cyclohexane.gif <p> Cycloalkane Molecular Formula Basic Structure Cyclopropane ( C3H60 cyclopropane.gif Cyclobutane C4H8C4H8 cyclobutane.gif Cyclopentane C5H10C5H10 cyclopentane.gif Cyclohexane C6H12C6H12 cyclohexane.gif Cycloheptane C7H14C7H14 cycloheptane.gif Cyclooctane C8H16C8H16 cyclooctane.gif Cyclononane C9H18C9H18 cyclononane.gif Cyclodecane C10H20C10H20 cyclodecane.gif IUPAC Rules for Nomenclature Determine the cycloalkane to use as the parent chain . The parent chain is the one with the highest number of carbon atoms . If there are two cycloalkanes , use the cycloalkane with the higher number of carbons as the parent chain . If there is an alkyl straight chain that has a greater number of carbons than the cycloalkane , then the alkyl chain must be used as the primary parent chain . Cycloalkane acting as a substituent to an alkyl chain has an ending " -yl " and , therefore , must be named as a cycloalkyl . <p> The longest straight chain contains 10 carbons , compared with cyclopropane , which only contains 3 carbons . Because cyclopropane is a substituent , it would be named a cyclopropyl-substituted alkane . <p> Determine any functional groups or other alkyl groups . Number the carbons of the cycloalkane so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lowest possible number . A carbon with multiple substituents should have a lower number than a carbon with only one substituent or functional group . One way to make sure that the lowest number possible is assigned is to number the carbons so that when the numbers corresponding to the substituents are added , their sum is the lowest possible . drawing01 ( 2 ) . gif(1+3=4) NOT drawing02 ( 4 ) . gif(1+5=6) <p> When naming the cycloalkane , the substituents and functional groups must be placed in alphabetical order . noname20.gif drawing03.gif <p> ( ex : **37;2036;TOOLONG ) <p> Indicate the carbon number with the functional group with the highest priority according to alphabetical order . A dash " - " must be placed between the numbers and the name of the substituent . After the carbon number and the dash , the name of the substituent can follow . When there is only one substituent on the parent chain , indicating the number of the carbon atoms with the substituent is not necessary .

When there are four of the same functional group , the name must have the prefix " tetra " . However , these prefixes can not be used when determining the alphabetical priorities .

If there are three alcohol groups , the molecule will have a " tri- " prefix before " -ol " ( triol ) , etc . <p> Example 4 The alcohol substituent is given the lowest number even though the two methyl groups are on the same carbon atom and labeling 1 on that carbon atom would give the lowest possible numbers .

The term " Schr+dinger equation " actually refers to two separate equations , often called the time-dependent and time-independent Schr+dinger equations .

To generalize this free-particle derivation to a particle in an arbitrary potential , one needs only to add ( VPsi ) to the right hand side . This is sufficient to obtain the result , the time-dependent Schr+dinger equation : <h> Operator Formulation of the Schr+dinger Equation <p> Quantum mechanics is inherently linear , which means linear algebra is the language of QM . Thus , it is most appropriate to write the Schr+dinger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ QM is further discussed in the wavefunctions and measurement wiki . <p> For now , note that it is useful to define the energy operator ( hatE ) and momentum operator ( hatp ) : <p> hatE = ihbar partialt , qquad hatp = -ihbar partialx . <p> This discussion is motivated by the description of a particle as a superposition of plane wave states . Considering a plane wave ( psi = efracihbar ( px - Et ) ) , applying these operators yields <p> Therefore , the eigenvalues of these operators correspond to the energy and momentum of a wavefunction , respectively . <p> Using this fact , it is straightforward to formulate the Schr+dinger equation directly from operators . Note that the energy of a classical particle is <p> E = fracp22m + V , <p> where ( V ) is the potential energy . Considering the system in quantum mechanics requires " promoting " all variables to operators acting on a wavefunction . The energy becomes the Hamiltonian operator ( hatH ) : <p> hatH psi = frachatp22m psi + V psi . <p> Equating the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hatE ) , one obtains the time-dependent Schr+dinger equation again from the operator formulation : <h> Formulation from Unitary Evolution <p> A last formulation of the time-dependent Schr+dinger equation is the method from unitary evolution . Recall that a unitary operator is one that preserves the norm of a state . To this end , suppose that states evolve in time unitarily so that the total probability of a wavefunction is always one : <p> psi ( x , t ) = hatU ( t ) psi ( x , 0 ) , <p> with ( hatUdagger hatU = hat1 ) at all times . <p> Plugging this state into the Schr+dinger equation , one can verify that it is a solution at all times : <p> where the second equation is purely an equation for the operator ( hatU ( t ) ) . Assuming the Hamiltonian is time-independent , the solution to this first-order ODE is <p> hatU = e-ihatH t / hbar . <p> Therefore , the state <p> psi ( x , t ) = e-ihatH t / hbar psi ( x , 0 ) <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been shown that unitary evolution is equivalent to Schr+dinger evolution . <p> Since any state ( psi ( x , 0 ) ) can be written in a superposition of energy eigenstates as <p> psi ( x , 0 ) = sumn phin ( x ) , <p> the general solution to the Schr+dinger equation given an initial state can be found by individually evolving each energy eigenstate : <p> psi ( x , t ) = sumn e-iEn t / hbar phin ( x ) . <h> A particle in quantum mechanics has the non-normalized wavefunction at time ( t=0 ) : <p> psi(x) = 2 phi2 + i phi5 , where the ( phin ) are the orthonormal eigenstates of some Hamiltonian with energies ( En = n3 ) . <p> Find the normalized wavefunction at all times . <p> First , normalize the wavefuntion at time ( t=0 ) .

For such states , ( hatE psi = Epsi ) by definition . The Schrodinger equation then becomes ( hatH psi = Epsi ) , where ( E ) is now a constant and not an operator .

From the compact form ( hatH psi = E psi ) , one can see that the time-independent Schr+dinger equation is an eigenvector equation for ( hatH ) . The set of values of ( E ) for which there exists a corresponding ( psi ) satisfying this equation is called the spectrum of the Hamiltonian ( H ) . If two or more linearly independent eigenfunctions share the same eigenvalue , we call that eigenvalue ( and the spectrum containing that eigenvalue ) degenerate .

Scientific notation shows the relationship between different values and allows for easier movement between scales . <h> Standard Format <p> Scientific notation is written using 10 as the base number and an exponent , as in ( a times 10b , ) where <p> ( 1 leq a &lt; 10 ) <p> ( b ) is an integer , which can be positive or negative . <p> A simple way to convert a number to scientific notation is to move the decimal point to the left or right the number of places needed to get a number ( a ) such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number of places the decimal point was moved is ( b ) . If the decimal point was moved to the left , ( b ) is positive ( the original number is larger than ( b ) ) and if the decimal point was moved to the right , ( b ) is negative and the number being represented is smaller than ( b ) . <p> Write ( 1234567 ) in scientific notation . <p> 1.234567 times 106 <p> Write 0.000000901 in scientific notation . <p> 0.000000901 = 9.01 times 10-7 <p> Scientific notation is helpful in two ways : <p> The exponents allow for quick and accurate comparisons . It is much easier to evaluate which number is larger between ( 3 times 108 ) and ( 3 times 1011 ) than it is to compare ( 300000000 ) and ( 300000000000 ) . <p> It conveys the number of significant figures in a measurement .

The operations are then carried out on the values of ( a ) . <p> Add ( 1.42 times 102 ) and ( 3.45 times 103 . ) <p> Both exponents must have the same value . Choosing either option will give the same answer : beginalign 3.45 times 103 &amp;= 34.5 times 102 Rightarrow 34.5 times 102 + 1.42 times 102 &amp;= 35.92 times 102. endalign The conventions of scientific notation requires a number less than 10 , so the answer can be rewritten as ( 3.592times 103 . ) <p> Often , the answer obtained by following this process will not be in standard scientific notation , so a final step ( moving the decimal point and adjusting the exponent ) is needed to convert the answer to the proper format . <h> Fun with Scale : The Diameter of an Atom <p> An atom is mostly empty space . That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ straightforward . Then , the diagrams in the textbook look something like this : <p> Diagrams of atoms are usually not drawn to scale . Image from Wikimedia Commons user Rainer Klute . <p> Based on this image , a student might reasonably believe that the nucleus takes up about 10% of the atom 's space , while 90% of the atom is empty space . However , the diameters of the nucleus and the electron orbital are not drawn to scale . Looking at those numerical values paints a wildly different picture from the one shown above . <p> The best estimate of a hydrogen atom 's diameter is about 0.84 femtometers . A femtometer is ( 10-15 simeter ) . Rewrite the diameter in meters using scientific notation . <p> 8.4times10-14 simeter <p> The diameter of a hydrogen atom 's orbiting electron can be estimated using Bohr 's model and is approximately ( 1times10-10 simeter ) . So the difference between the proton 's diameter and the atom 's diameter is about four orders of magnitude . That difference in scale can be used to make a macroscopic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tennis ball , how big would the electron orbital be on a hydrogen atom ? <p> Poll a group of general chemistry students , and their answers may vary widely . The size of a soccer ball ? The size of a soccer stadium ? The size of the city ? The estimates may depend on what images the student has seen in textbooks , but many of them will be off by several orders of magnitude . <p> Assume the tennis ball is about ( 6.5text cm , ) or ( 6.5times10-2text m ) , in diameter . The electron 's orbit would be four orders of magnitude bigger , or around ( 102text m ) . <p> The three known diameters can be used to solve for the diameter of the electron orbital in the tennis ball model . <p> A diameter of 77 meters is equal to a radius of 38.5 meters . A full tennis court is 23.77 meters long . So , if the tennis ball is the nucleus of a hydrogen atom , its electron is 38.5 meters away , or approximately 1.62 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The full hydrogen atom would be over 3 tennis courts lengths wide . 
@@77511934 @6211934/ <p> Newton 's laws of motion are three physical laws that can be considered as the foundation for classical mechanics . They describe the relationship between a body , the forces acting on it , and its motion in response to those forces . Forces are the bread and butter of Newtonian mechanics . Though they 're not always the easiest way to think about the world , everything in classical mechanics can be derived from Newton 's basic principles that relate force and motion . <h> Contents <h> Newton 's First Law <p> The famous statement of the first law is as follows : <p> Newton 's first law states that all objects in motion will remain in motion unless acted on by an external force . <p> In other words , if there is no force on an object , then its state of motion will not change . Thus , an object that starts at rest will remain at rest , unless it is acted upon by a force . It is perhaps best to illustrate by an example : <p> Kimmi in a wind tunnel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ test the airflow of her new outfits . There is a strong wind that pushes her backward with a force of ( 200text N. ) How strong must the frictional force between Kimmi 's skis and the floor be in order for Kimmi to stay still ? <p> Because Kimmi does n't move , we know that ( Delta v=0 ) , which implies that the net force on Kimmi ( Ftextrmnet = 0 ) . <p> start-definition Net force is the sum of all forces acting on an object : <p> Ftextrmnet = sumlimitsi Fi . <p> A corollary to the first law is that if an object is moving , it will keep moving at a constant speed unless acted upon a net force . Mathematically , we say that if ( Ftextrmnet=0 ) , then ( Delta v=0 ) . <p> The bench-press <p> Imgur <p> Devin is bench-pressing at the gym . He lifts a barbell of weight ( 500text N ) vertically upward from his chest . If the barbell rises at a constant speed , what is the magnitude of the force Devin exerts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two forces : the downward pull of gravity , and the force with which Devin lifts the barbell up . Since the barbell rises at a constant speed , its state of motion does not change . Thus ( Delta v=0 ) , which implies that the net force on the barbell is ( Ftextrmnet=0 ) . <p> In other words , ( FtextrmDevin+500text N=0 ) and ( FtextrmDevin=-500text N , ) so now we know that Devin is pushing the barbell with magnitude ( 500text N ) . <h> Carolyn and her new laptop <p> Imgur <p> Carolyn has just bought a new laptop . She places it on her desk and thinks about what she has learned today in science class : " Since this laptop weighs ( 3text kg ) , a gravitational force of ( 30text N ) is exerted on it . Then why does it stay on the desk instead of falling to the ground ? " Can you answer Carolyn 's question ? <p> Since the laptop stays at rest , ( Delta v=0 ) , which implies that the net force exerted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gravitation force pulls the laptop downward with magnitude ( 30text N ) . For the net force to be equal to zero , an upward force with magnitude ( 30text N ) must be exerted on the laptop , which is the normal force by the desk . <p> As we can see from the examples above , objects at rest will stay at rest , and moving objects will continue to move at constant speed , if there are no net forces applied . This property of an object , its natural resistance to changes in its state of motion , is called inertia . In fact , another name for the first law is the law of inertia . <h> Forces <p> One of the first steps to solving a mechanics problem is the identification of all relevant forces . We say that an object which has some speed ( s ) in a given direction will keep moving at the speed ( s ) in the same direction , unless it is acted upon by an outside influence : a force ( F ) . A force @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speed , or direction according to an observer who travels at a constant velocity . Forces are perhaps most clearly defined in the statement of the first law : <p> Newton 's first law states that ( Delta v = 0 ) unless acted on by a nonzero force , ( Ftextrmnet neq 0 . ) <p> Evidently , a force is something that causes a measurable change in the velocity of an object , according to an inertial observer . Here , we will clearly delineate what we can mean by observer . While it is not necessary , an observer can be thought of as a scientist making a measurement , though in principle there need not be any sentient being , or even any measurement made by an observer in the physics sense of the word . <p> If a measurement is performed by an observer who moves at a constant velocity , we call the observer an inertial observer . We also say that they sit in an inertial reference frame . Every change in motion that an inertial observer measures is the result of some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with one another on the changes in motion that they record . <p> By contrast , a person sitting on an accelerating train is a non-inertial observer . If a toy car were to be placed on the ground in front of the train , it would appear ( to the conductor ) to accelerate toward the front of the train . However , the toy car is not actually " moving , " but the train is accelerating toward it ! This " measurement " is purely a consequence of the observer 's own motion , and is not caused by any real force . <p> Thus , when identifying forces , one must be sure that the frame they 're considering is inertial . <p> Somebody who sits on a train heading due North at the speed ( u ) relative to the ground is an inertial observer . Were they to measure the motion of some object that moves outside the train at constant velocity ( v ) ( such as a hummingbird ) , they would agree with all other inertial observers that ( Delta v @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and those of other inertial observers could be the hummingbird 's absolute velocity . <p> Newton 's laws do n't concern velocities as such , but only their change . From the perspective of an inertial observer , acceleration is the sign of an underlying force . There are no illusory accelerations seen by inertial observers due to their own motion . Whenever we observe an accelerating object in an inertial reference frame , we can find the force that causes it . <p> Concretely , if somebody on the train measured the speed of a hummingbird flying at speed ( v ) relative to the ground , the observer on the train would measure the hummingbird 's speed as ( vprime = v - u ) , while the observer on the ground would measure ( v ) . In general , ( vtextrmhummingbird neq vtextrmhummingbirdprime ) , as measured by two inertial observers . There are no perceived accelerations that can arise purely because of the observer 's own motion . <p> Let 's look at some examples : <h> Airbus takeoff <p> During takeoff , a passenger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Delta v=vtextrmtakeoff ) . What causes this acceleration ? <p> The acceleration of the Airbus is caused by the force of thrust from the engines . The engines accelerate the air molecules , blasting air backward at very high speed . Because forces balance , the plane is pushed forward with the same force . <h> Jimmy 's 3-pointer <p> Imgur <p> Jimmy is playing guard in a basketball tournament . He makes a shot and scores 3 points . During his shot the ball leaves his hands , goes up in the air , and falls back into the net . If the air resistance is negligible , what causes the ball to descend ? <p> After the ball leaves Jimmy 's hands , it experiences one force : the downward pull of gravity . This causes a downward acceleration of ( gapprox10text m/s2 ) , so the ball slows down while ascending , then falls back down . The ball 's horizontal motion does not change during its flight , since there is no force acting horizontally on the ball . <h> Kimmi on the slope <p> Kimmi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her outfits . She starts at the top of the slope , and gains speed . After gaining a speed of ( 20 ) miles per hour , she slides down at a steady rate . Then she applies her brakes and comes to a complete stop . Explain the relationship of the forces during her descent . <p> The force pulling her down the slope , which is the downward pull of gravity , is the source of her acceleration . During her acceleration this gravitational force is larger than the sum of the force due to air resistance , and the friction force between her skis and the slope . <p> When she slides down at a steady ( 20 ) miles per hour , ( Delta v=0 ) , which means the net force is equal to zero . Thus the gravitational force and the sum of the force exerted by air resistance and friction force are equal in magnitude . When she applies her brakes , the sum of friction force and air resistance becomes larger than the gravitational force and let 's her slow down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skids to a stop at a traffic light , the road pulls on the car through the rubber wheels and its velocity decreases in magnitude . The car is acted on by a force of friction . <p> There are lots of examples in ball sports . <h> Hitting a baseball <p> When a player hits a baseball with a bat , the bat pushes on the ball and the speed of the ball is initially decreased . Then the direction of the ball 's motion is reversed , and the ball accelerates again in the opposite direction . The ball is acted on by the force of contact . <p> There are even better examples in other sports <h> Skateboard ollie <p> A skater lifts off the ground by kicking a skateboard against the ground with a force ( Ftextrmkick ) , propelling them off the ground with velocity ( v ) . Once they 're in the air , they immediately start losing speed until the top of their jump , then ( v=0 ) . After the peak they accelerate back toward the ground . <p> A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line on a smooth , horizontal surface . Its velocity decreases from 5.0 m/s to 2.0 m/s in 6 seconds . <p> How far ( in meters ) does it travel during this time ? <h> Non-inertial Observers <p> If motion is measured by an observer who is accelerating , they are a non-inertial observer , and they can observe motions which appear to be the result of forces acting , but are really just artifacts of their own motion . <p> A skydiver accelerating toward Earth is not an inertial observer . Were the skydiver to measure the speed of an elephant who is sitting still on the Earth 's surface , they would perceive the elephant as accelerating toward them with ( atextrmelephant = g ) , and would think that the elephant was acted upon by a net force . <p> However , no observer from another reference frame would agree with them about the value of ( atextrmelephant ) that they assign to the elephant ( indeed it is zero ! ) , i.e. their measurement of ( atextrmelephant ) is frame dependent . <p> For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during his free-fall from space . <h> Puck on an accelerating ice rink <p> An example of an acceleration with no associated force is a hockey puck sitting on a sheet of ice in the back of a pickup truck , that appears to accelerate toward the back of the truck from the perspective of a passenger . The puck 's acceleration is not real , but an illusion which arises from the fact that the passenger sits in an accelerating frame of reference ( the truck ) , not a force . <h> Change is the Difference <p> It is okay for velocity measurements to be frame dependent because Newton 's laws do n't care about the absolute value of velocity , but only changes in it . Acceleration on the other hand is central to the laws of motion . We care deeply about the absolute value of the acceleration , not only in its changes . <h> Newton 's Second Law <p> As stated in the first law , a force ( F ) can give rise to the acceleration ( a ) of massive objects , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ direct like ( F propto a ) ( which denotes that ( F ) and ( a ) are proportional to one another ) . <p> But , do we expect a force ( F ) to accelerate any massive object with the same ( a ) ? The answer is no . <p> Based upon common sense , we expect things that weigh less to accelerate more quickly than objects which weigh more , when we apply the same force ( F ) . <h> Same force , different effect <p> Think of what would happen if we use the jet engine of a plane to propel a cruise ship . Although we 're providing a lot of thrust , we do n't expect the ship to accelerate very quickly because of how heavy it is . Now , think of using the jet engine to propel a waiter to your table ... actually , you can just watch : <p> Our observation suggests that the factor of proportionality in ( F propto a ) is ( m ) , the mass of an object . In other words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an object has , the less it will accelerate under a given force ( F ) . Thus the second law can be summarized with one simple equation : <h> Newton 's second law <p> F=ma . <p> A ( 500 text-kg ) rocket is to be accelerated from rest to ( 1600 text km/h ) at a constant rate in ( 1.8 ) seconds . What is the approximate magnitude of the required net force ? <p> Assume the loss of fuel makes a negligible change to the mass of the rocket . <h> Surfer tow-in <p> A ( 150 text kg ) surfer is towed in to a wave by a jet-ski with a rope of tension 30 N. At the same time , they feel a drag force of 10 N from the friction with ocean water . How quickly does the surfer accelerate while being towed in to the wave ? <p> Because the pull of the jet-ski and the drag force act in opposite directions , the surfer feels a net force of ( 30text N - 10text N = 20text N ) toward the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surfer 's acceleration <p> Hence , if no unbalanced external force ( ( F=0 ) ) acts on a body , it will remain in rest or in uniform motion ( ( v=u ) . ) <p> What is mass anyways ? When you first learn about mass , it 's often introduced as the coefficient that relates the force applied to an object to how the object accelerates . In short , we have the definition of the inertial mass as m=fracbigvecFbigveca from Newton 's second law . Some objects , like electrons and protons , have masses while other objects , like photons , do n't . This series of problems will walk you through how one can generate mass for different particles by the Higgs mechanism , which you may have heard of since it has been in the news a lot in the last few years ( and is one of the major motivations for the Large Hadron Collider in Europe ) . <p> We start with a ( hopefully ) simple question : Which of the following statements is correct in Newtonian mechanics ? <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ property of an object Mass depends on where an object is Mass is an unchangeable intrinsic property of an object <h> A Circle to Start <p> If we inspect the definitions for force , and mass , they seem a bit circular . <p> For example , we have the following two definition for mass and force : <p> 1 ) A force is something that accelerates an object of mass ( m ) according to ( F/m=a . ) <p> 2 ) An object has mass ( m ) if it accelerates at the rate ( displaystyle a = F/m ) under the force ( F. ) <p> However , these definitions provide a practical means to compare the behavior of objects under different influences , and we can use this to build up a deep theory of the motion of matter . After all , theories in physics only matter insofar as they agree with experiments : all models must makes themselves vulnerable to experimental verification . Consequently , all models must start with some unprovable assumptions . <h> Airbus reloaded <p> During takeoff , a passenger jet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the engine at the speed ( vtextrmair ) . What is the magnitude of the plane 's acceleration ? <p> The acceleration of the Airbus is caused by the thrust from the engines . The engines pull air through them and accelerate the air molecules to very high speeds . As forces are balanced , the plane is pushed forward with the same force . <p> A volume of air has a mass given by ( Mtextrmair = rhotextrmair Vtextrmair ) , and the engine accelerates it backward at speed ( vtextrmair ) . <p> If the engine has cross-sectional area ( Atextrmengine ) , then the engine accelerates a mass LONG ... t ) kg of air in the time ( Delta t ) it takes to accelerate across the engine . <p> Because the air picks up ( Delta v approx vtextrmair ) in time ( approx Delta t ) , we can estimate its acceleration through the engine to be ( atextrmair approx vtextrmair/Delta t ) . <h> Identifying Interactions between Objects <p> Newton 's third law of motion states that there are no unbalanced forces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ famous parable : <p> For every action , there is an equal and opposite reaction . <p> This means that whenever we find a force from one object A acting upon another B , there exists another force , equal in magnitude , from B to A. <h> Box on the ground <p> Resting on the ground , an object weighing ( displaystyle frac1gtext kg ) presses on the Earth with force ( 1 text N. ) In turn , the Earth pushes back up with ( 1 text N. ) <p> Force pairs do not get much more involved than this , though the story is usually complicated by convenient simplifications . <p> 1 . Near infinite mass One is to treat extremely massive objects as effectively immovable . For example , it may seem that an object in freefall toward a giant mass , like the Earth , is being acted on by the gravity of the Earth , but that the reverse action is not . In reality , the object is acting on the Earth with exactly the same force . However , because the mass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the object , the effect on the motion of Earth is indiscernible . <p> 2 . Fields Another potential source of confusion are fields . Whenever a force is transmitted over a distance , it can be useful to form a field . For instance , above the Earth , it is common to represent the force gravity as a field of strength LONG ... Because changes in height are usually small relative to the Earth 's radius ( RtextrmEarth ) , the field strength is approximately constant , and the force felt by any mass is just its mass ( m ) times the acceleration due to gravity ( approx g ) . In this picture , it may seem like the force comes from the field to the object , and that the object is n't actually interacting with the Earth . However , the field is just a convenient way to simplify calculations . In truth , the object has its own field whose strength is too weak to cause any appreciable acceleration of the Earth , so it is swept under the rug . <h> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motion expresses a simple fact about forces : they describe the interaction of things . In other words , a force can not be exerted on nothing . What does this imply for the forces between interacting objects ? <h> Two objects floating in free space <p> The forces that describe the interaction of two objects must be perfectly balanced by one another . If they were n't , the two objects considered together would have a net force left over which acts upon nothing . <p> This implies that whenever object A pushes on object B with force ( FAB ) , object B pushes back with ( FBA = -FAB , ) and that therefore <p> sum F = FAB+FBA=0 . <p> The two forces are equal in magnitude , but point in opposite direction . <p> In practical terms , this means that if I push on something , it will push back on me . <h> Isaac Newton 's pro skater <p> If a skateboarder wants to jump off the ground , they have to push their board down on the solid ground . In return @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equal force , causing them to lift off the ground . <p> Nothing significant happens to the Earth because it is so much heavier than the skateboarder ( left ( ME gg mtextrmskaterright ) , ) but if we were to look very , very closely , we 'd see that the Earth actually moves by a tiny distance when the skateboarder leaves the ground . <h> Rocket power <p> Partnering the Earth with an ordinary object in a balance of forces is a little extreme . The Earth has so much more mass than any common objects that its acceleration is virtually unnoticeable to the senses . <p> The force balance is apparent in more equal pairings . For example , if someone sit on a cart and spray a fire extinguisher to the left ( accelerating the foam molecules to the left ) , they will roll to the right . <p> Seriously , watch it : <p> Like the rest of the examples , the fire extinguisher cart can be understood as a consequence of the third law . <p> Can you explain it ? <h> How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) transfer to the floor , if it falls from a height of ( 80text cm ) ? Take its downward acceleration to be ( 10 textrm m/s2 ) . <p> You push a heavy car by hand . The car , in turn , pushes back on you . Does n't this mean that the forces cancel each other , making acceleration impossible ? Why or why not ? <p> ( ) A. Yes : In accord with Newton 's second law , ( a =fracFnetm ) , and since ( Fnet=Fyou+Fcar=0 ) , no acceleration occurs . <p> B. Yes : In accord with Newton 's first and third laws , an object continues in its state of rest unless it is compelled to change that state by forces impressed upon it . Since the net force is zero , the car does n't move . <p> C. No : In accord with Newton 's third law , I push the car and the car pushes with an equal and opposite force on me . Thus , with Newton 's second law and ( a=fracFm ) , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and opposite direction . <p> D. No : An external , horizontal force is applied to the car by my push ; the car accelerates ( in accord with Newton 's first law ) . <p> ( ) Note : By acceleration we mean acceleration relative to the ground .

For example , my 3D position relative to the center of the earth is a vector because it has a length ( my distance from the center ) , as well as a direction ( my orientation with respect to the center ) . When I ride my bike , a vector can be used to describe the speed and direction in which I travel , it is called my velocity , ( vecv ) . <p> Temperature on the other hand is not a vector . Although temperature has a magnitude at every point , it has no direction , and the magnitude can not serve as the length of anything . It is simply a number that is defined at every point in space ( for the eager reader the technical term is a scalar field ) . <p> However , not every combination of length and direction is a vector . For example , we could say that ( vecb1 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the direction ( theta = 0circ ) , while ( vecb2 ) represents the number of books I read while looking in the direction ( theta=90circ ) . However , if I read ( X ) books while facing ( theta=0circ ) and then read ( Y ) books while facing ( theta=90circ ) , it is not equivalent to reading ( Z ) books while facing in some new direction . In fact , there is no way to combine these objects in a way that makes sense . <p> On the other hand , if I walk 1 m in the ( x ) direction , followed by 1 m in the ( y ) direction , it is clearly the same result as if I 'd walked ( sqrt2 ) m in the direction ( theta = 45circ ) . There is a straightforward way to combine two displacements into a meaningful overall displacement . This property is essential for vectors in physics . <h> Cartesian Coordinate System <p> One of the common ways to represent a vector is to define it in terms of the Cartesian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ position by the ( x ) coordinate , and my North-South position by the ( y ) coordinate . For example , if I walk 1 m to the East of a sleeping elephant we can represent this motion by ( vecp1 =langle 1 , 0 rangle ) . If I then walk 1 m to his North , this motion can be represented by ( vecp2 = langle 0 , 1 rangle ) . <h> Vector addition <p> If this representation is consistent , we had better be able to represent my overall position relative to the sleeping elephant by the vector ( ptextrmtotal = langle 1 , 1 rangle ) . <p> In fact , we see that to get the overall displacement , we may simply add the ( x ) and ( y ) entries of the two vectors , I.e. <p> which is indeed equal to the overall position . This gives us a simple and consistent way to add vectors in the Cartesian representation . We simply add the vectors component-wise . <h> Polar Coordinates <p> Another common representation for vectors is the polar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thetaright ) ) to specify our displacement relative to the elephant . For example , after ( vecp2 ) , when we 're standing 1 m to the North of the sleeping elephant , we are at ( vecp2 = left(1,90circright) ) , which is to say that we stand a distance of 1 m from the origin at the angle ( theta = 90circ ) to the origin . We see then that ( langle 0,1rangle ) and ( left(1,90circright) ) are perfectly equivalent to one another . <h> Calculating vector addition in polar coordinates <p> If we take both motions in order , we expect to arrive at ( vecptextrmtotal = big ( sqrt2 , 45circbig ) ) . Evidently , to compose vectors in the polar coordinate system , we ca n't simply add ( r1+r2 ) to get ( rtextrmtotal ) or ( theta1+theta2 ) to obtain ( thetatextrmtotal ) . <p> We recall the transformation between polar and Cartesian coordinates . If ( langle x , yrangle ) is the Cartesian representation of a vector , and ( left ( r , thetaright ) ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <h> Coordinate Independence <p> One of the nice things about the Cartesian system is that vectors are added with ease , while it is a bit unnatural in the polar system . Each has its place however , and it is often much simpler to work in the polar system . <p> Despite the convenience of working in one representation or another , it is important to realize they are only tools for manipulation . The vectors exist independently and apart from the representations themselves . This means that the results of a vector calculation can not depend on the coordinate system employed for the calculation , a fact that is extremely useful in circular motion , relativity , and other places later on in physics .

@@77511939 @6211939/ <h> Damped Harmonic Oscillators 26449 @qwx646449 <p> Damped harmonic oscillators are vibrating systems for which the amplitude of vibration decreases over time . Since nearly all physical systems involve considerations such as air resistance , friction , and intermolecular forces where energy in the system is lost to heat or sound , accounting for damping is important in realistic oscillatory systems . Examples of damped harmonic oscillators include any real oscillatory system like a yo-yo , clock pendulum , or guitar string : after starting the yo-yo , clock , or guitar string vibrating , the vibration slows down and stops over time , corresponding to the decay of sound volume or amplitude in general . <p> Mathematically , damped systems are typically modeled by simple harmonic oscillators with viscous damping forces , which are proportional to the velocity of the system and permit easy solution of Newton 's second law in closed form . These are second-order ordinary differential equations which include a term proportional to the first derivative of the amplitude . As described below , the magnitude of the proportionality describes how quickly the vibrations of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <h> Exponential Decay from Damping Forces <p> Damping forces are often due to motion of an oscillatory system through a fluid like air or water , where interactions between the molecules of the fluid ( e.g. air resistance ) become important . At low velocities in non-turbulent fluid , the damping of a harmonic oscillator is well-modeled by a viscous damping force ( Fd = -b dotx ) . Adding this term to the simple harmonic oscillator equation given by Hooke 's law gives the equation of motion for a viscously damped simple harmonic oscillator . <p> mddotx + b dotx + kx = 0 , <p> where ( b ) is a constant sometimes called the damping constant . <p> Solutions should be oscillations within some form of damping envelope . Ansatz an exponential damping envelope : <p> x(t) = Ae-gt eiat = Aet ( ai-g ) = Aert . <p> where ( A ) is some constant and ( r = ai-g ) will be found . Plugging this ansatz into the equation of motion yields : <p> These solutions in general describe oscillation at frequency ( omega @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time-dependent amplitude ( e-fracb2m t ) . <p> Depending on the values of ( m ) , ( k ) , and ( gamma ) , the solution exhibits different types of behavior : <p> ( b2 &lt; 4km ) : Underdamping <p> Underdamped solutions oscillate rapidly with the frequency and decay envelope described above . For objects with very small damping constant ( such as a well-made tuning fork ) , the frequency of oscillation is very close to the undamped natural frequency ( omega0 = sqrtfrackm ) . <p> Underdamped oscillations within an exponential decay envelope . <p> ( b2 = 4km ) : Critical damping <p> This case corresponds to the vanishing of the frequency ( sqrtfrackm - fracb24m2 ) described previously . At this level of damping , the solution ( x(t) ) most rapidly approaches the steady-state amplitude of zero . Larger amounts of damping ( see overdamping ) cause the solution to more slowly approach zero as it moves slowly through the damping fluid , whereas smaller amounts of damping cause the solution to oscillate more rapidly around zero . Notably , solutions at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( sqrtfrackm - fracb24m2 ) vanishes , the two linearly independent solutions can be written : <p> x(t) = Ae-fracb2m t + Bte-fracb2m t . <p> Time evolution of the amplitude of a critically damped harmonic oscillator . <p> A ( 2 textkg ) mass attached to a spring of spring constant ( k = 10 text N/textm ) oscillates through a fluid that exerts a damping force ( Fd = - ( 4 text Ncdottexts/textm ) : v ) on the mass , where ( v ) is the velocity of the mass .

The amplitudes of the critically damped and overdamped harmonic oscillators similarly decay exponentially . <p> Several parameters are used throughout physics and engineering literature to describe how the amplitude of a damped harmonic oscillator decays over time . The most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , often denoted as ( tau ) . Suppose a damped harmonic oscillator starts at amplitude ( x0 ) ; then the amplitude of the damping envelope is ( x0 e-fracb2m t ) . The ( 1/e ) decay time is defined as the time ( tau ) for which the amplitude has decreased to ( x0 / e approx .368 x0 ) . This is equivalent to the exponent in the decay envelope taking value ( -1 ) , i.e. : <p> -fracb2m tau = -1 implies tau = frac2mb . <p> A ( 10 text kg ) mass is attached to a spring of spring constant ( 10 text N/textm ) .

Critical damping occurs at ( Q = frac12 ) , marking the boundary of the two damping regimes . <h> What is the quality factor of a damped harmonic oscillator in terms of ( k ) , ( m ) , and ( b ) ? <p> Solution : <p> The stored energy in the damped harmonic oscillator is the " spring potential energy " : E(t) = frac12 kA(t)2 where ( A(t) ) is the amplitude of the harmonic oscillator . Recalling that the damped harmonic oscillator has a ( e-fracb2m t ) decay envelope , this is equal to : E(t) = frac12 k A2 e-fracbm t = E0 e-fracbm t . <p> The energy dissipated per radian is : Delta E = leftfracdEdtright Delta t , with ( Delta t ) giving the time it takes to oscillate through one radian , equal to ( frac1omega ) . <p> The derivative is given by ( fracdEdt = -fracbm E(t) ) , so the energy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> and finally the quality factor is : Q = fracEb/ ( momega ) E = fracmomegab , where ( omega = sqrtfrackm - fracb24m2 ) is the frequency of the damped harmonic oscillator .

It is not a good model for dry friction , the usual friction force from rubbing against solid objects governed by the equation ( Ff = mu N ) , with ( mu ) the coefficient of friction and ( N ) the normal force . Interestingly , simple models of dry friction are solvable and demonstrate a linear damping envelope rather than an exponential . <h> Problems and Phenomena <p> The equations of the damped harmonic oscillator can model objects literally oscillating while immersed in a fluid as well as more abstract systems in which quantities oscillate while losing energy . The damped harmonic oscillator is a good model for many physical systems because most systems both obey Hooke 's law when perturbed about an equilibrium point and also lose energy as they decay back to equilibrium .

Unlike the figure above , we assume that the capacitor has already been charged and there is no external voltage source connected to the circuit . The voltages across each of the resistor ( resistance ( R ) ) , capacitor ( capacitance ( C ) ) , and inductor ( inductance ( L ) ) depend on the charge ( Q ) on the capacitor and current ( I ) in the circuit , where ( I = -fracdQdt ) if the capacitor is discharging : <p> noting that the voltage across the capacitor opposes the flow of conventional current .

Hydrogen fusion targets are mounted on a stalk made of the highly flexible synthetic polymer Zylon . Although this flexibility prevents targets from breaking off the stalk , it also permits the fusion target to undergo damped oscillation when the laser hits it . Oscillation displaces the center of mass of the target , which reduces the efficiency of the lasers and reduces the chance of fusion ; therefore , it is highly desirable to achieve both ( 1 ) high fundamental frequencies of oscillation , since these are less easily excited and ( 2 ) near-critical damping , to reduce oscillation amplitude quickly 3 . <p> ( a ) Most of the weight of the hydrogen fusion target is in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1000 text kg/textm3 ) ) that contains the hydrogen , which approximately forms a sphere about ( 10-4 text m ) in diameter .

@@77511951 @6211951/ <h> Quiz 26449 @qwx646449 <p> An inverse function is the " reversal " of another function ; specifically , the inverse will swap input and output with the original function . <p> Given a function ( f(x) ) , the inverse is written ( f-1(x) ) , but this should not be read as a negative exponent . Generally speaking , the inverse of a function is not the same as its reciprocal . <p> Understanding ( and keeping straight ) inverse functions and reciprocal functions comes down to understanding operations , identities , and inverses more broadly . You are already very familiar with these things from basic arithmetic . Given an object ( x ) ( say , a real number or a function ) , what we deem its inverse ( x-1 ) will depend on the operation . Two objects are inverses if we can apply the operation to them and get back the identity element for that operation . Here are some examples : <p> If the operation is addition , the identity element is 0 because adding 0 to any object ( x @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ x = x ) and ( x+0=x ) . Thus , two objects are additive inverses if they can be added together to yield 0 . Given a number or function ( x ) , the additive inverse is always ( -x ) . <p> If the operation is multiplication , the identity element is 1 , because multiplying any other object ( x ) with 1 yields ( x ) again : ( 1 cdot x = x ) and ( x cdot 1 = x ) . Therefore , two objects are multiplicative inverses if they can be multiplied together to yield 1 . Given a nonzero number or function ( x , ) the multiplicative inverse is always ( 1/x ) , otherwise known as the reciprocal . <p> In the case of functional inverses , the operation is function composition . It is less obvious now , but the identity element for composition is ( x ) . To see this , observe that if ( g(x) ) is composed with the function ( x ) , we get ( g(x)circ ( x ) = g @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circ g(x) = g(x) ) . Thus , given functions ( f(x) ) and ( g(x) ) , ( g(x) ) is the inverse of ( f(x) ) if and only if ( g ( f ( x ) ) =x ) and ( f ( g ( x ) ) =x ) . In this case , we write ( g(x)=f-1(x) ) . <p> Hence , the inverse of a function need not be a function itself , since it could take on multiple values . <h> Finding the inverse of a function graphically <p> Given the point ( ( x , y ) ) on the graph of ( f ) , we know that the point ( ( y , x ) ) is on the graph of ( f-1 ) . These two points are related by being symmetric in the line ( y =x ) .

Draw the graph of the inverse of the blue curve . <p> image <p> 1 ) Since both the axes are drawn to the same scale , so we can simply fold the graph about ( y = x ) to get the red part . <p> image <p> 2 ) Now we trace the rest of the graph to get the complete graph of the inverse . <p> image <p> 3 ) The red @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the curves are reflections of each other about the line ( y = x ) . We have found the inverse of the function graphically ! <h> When is the inverse a function ? <p> As mentioned , the inverse of a function need not be a function . In order for it to be a function , given any ( y ) value , there is at most one ( x ) value such that ( f(x) = y ) . This means that when we look at a horizontal line ( y = c ) , it cuts the graph in at most 1 point . This is also known as the horizontal line test . <p> More formally , we say that <p> The inverse of the function ( f ) is a function , if and only if ( f ) is a bijective function . ( square ) <p> If ( f ) were n't injective , then there would exist an ( f(x) ) for two values of ( x ) , which we call ( x1 ) and ( x2 ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will have two values ( x1 ) and ( x2 ) . However , a function can not have two outputs for one input . Then it is no longer a function . Therefore , ( f ) has to be injective . <p> If ( f ) is not surjective , then there would exist a value ( k in X ) such that ( f(x) = k ) has no real solution for ( x ) . This is because there exists some value which belongs to the codomain of the function , but not in the range of the function . Then ( f-1(k) ) would not be defined as ( k ) is not in the range of ( f-1 ) . There must be no such value in the domain of ( f-1 ) for which ( f-1 ) is undefined . Therefore the range of ( f ) must be equal to the codomain of ( f ) . Therfore ( f ) must be a surjective function . <p> Since ( f ) must be both an injective and a surjective function , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Finding the inverse of a function algebraically <p> To find the inverse of ( f ) , we take the following steps : <p> 1 ) Check that it satisfies the horizontal line test . 2 ) Substitute ( x ) with ( f-1 ( x ) ) and ( f(x) ) with ( x ) . Make ( f-1(x) ) the subject of the formula . 3 ) Determine the domain of ( f -1 ) , which is the codomain of ( f ) . Note that this might not be the range of ( f ) . 4 ) Determine the range of ( f-1 ) , which is the domain of ( f ) . <p> In this example , we see why it is important to determine the codomain of the original function , instead of relying just on the given range . <h> Find the inverse of <p> h : -1 , 0 rightarrow 0,1 , quad h(x) = - x2 . <p> Step 1 : This graph satisfies the horizontal line test . <p> Step 2 : The substitution gives us ( x @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us to make ( h-1 ( x ) ) the subject of the formula , we have to take square roots and obtain that ( h -1 ( x ) = pm sqrt - x ) .

@@77511952 @6211952/ <h> Applications of Logarithms <p> Developed by Charles Richter in 1935 to compare the intensities of earthquakes .

@@77511953 @6211953/ <h> Quiz 26449 @qwx646449 <p> The aim of any calculation in physics is to find an equation that relates the variables of the system . Such relations are incredibly useful because they capture the behavior of infinitely many instantiations of a problem in a single , comprehensible statement of equality . For example , we know how a bomb 's blast radius grows over time given the density of the atmosphere and the bomb 's energy . We know how fast a projectile must be fired to escape the gravitational field of a planet . We can even estimate the amount of time needed for a stirred cup of coffee to settle . Because equalities are so useful , great time and intellectual investment is devoted to finding them through any number of mathematical techniques and calculating tricks . <p> What causes a cup of coffee to settle down ? <p> All methods however are not equal , and there exists a trick , based on the simplest of observations , that can let us leapfrog from the bowels of confusion to a point where we have a valid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without any calculation at all . The trick is dimensional analysis . <h> Contents <h> Dimensional analysis <p> The observation is that if an equation correctly describes the physics of a system , the least we can say is that each side of the equation has the same units as the other . In other words , we must be comparing apples to apples . We can take any well known result , the equivalence of mass and energy for instance , and find this to be the case . For a free particle , we have ( E=mc2 ) , where ( c ) is the speed of light , ( m ) is its relativistic mass , and ( E ) is its total energy . On the right hand side , we have units of mass multiplied twice by units of velocity , or ( textkgtext m2 / text s2 ) , which we recognize as Newton meters , ( textNm . ) On the left we have energy , which has units of Newton meters by definition . Thus , we see that we have an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the risk of further underwhelming , we point out that the quotient , ( E/mc2 ) , is a dimensionless product , i.e. is a parameter that has no physical units , just a pure number . It is these dimensionless quantities that we are after because they are the only combinations of our variables that can possibly give rise to correct physical relationships . <p> Before we move on , it is useful to introduce twiddle notation , ( sim ) . If a quantity ( g ) is equal to some combination of factors ( f ( r1 , ldots , rn ) ) , save for some numerical multiplier ( gamma ) such that ( g=gamma f ( r1 , ldots , rn ) ) , then we say ( gsim f ( r1 , ldots , rn ) ) . <p> For example , if ( f = 24pi l2 ) , or ( f = l2/100 ) , we say in both cases that ( fsim l2 ) . For all ( f ) for which this relation holds , we say that ( f @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ numerical constant that can be obtained by measuring ( f ) at a single value of ( l2 ) , ( f ) is determined entirely through its dependence on the quantity ( l ) . <p> Twiddle representation of famous results <p> Some famous relations in math and physics , recast using twiddle notation are : <p> Another closely related notation is ( propto ) which is used to denote that the left hand side is proportional to the right hand side . In contrast to ( xsim l ) , ( x propto l ) does not mean that the behavior of ( x ) is captured soley through ( l ) , but that ( l ) is a factor . For instance , if ( f ( x , y , z ) = pi xyz ) , we can say ( fpropto x ) , ( fpropto y ) , and ( fpropto z ) . <p> As we mentioned above , any true physical relation must have equal units on both sides . Thus , if we ignore dimensionless pre-factors ( pure numbers ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LONG ... 1 ) for all physical relations . More generally , we can replace LONG ... by an arbitrary product containing all the problem 's relevant variables raised to as yet unspecified powers , i.e. ( xalpha ybeta zgamma sim 1 ) . We call this product our scaling relation , because it shows how each variable will change as the scale ( magnitude ) of the other variables are changed . <p> Now , our scaling relation is composed of different factors , each of which has possibly different combinations of the basic dimensions ( length , time , mass , charge , et cetera ) . Suppose we have a system whose relevant variables are known to be position ( r ) , velocity ( v ) , and time ( t ) , so that we our scaling relation is given by ( ralpha vbeta tgamma sim 1 ) . We denote the dimensions of the variable ( x ) by ( leftxright ) , and we have ( leftrright = textL ) , ( leftvright = textLtextT-1 ) , ( lefttright = textT ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have ( textLalpha textLbetatextT-beta textTgamma sim 1 ) , or ( textLalpha+beta textT-beta + gamma sim 1 = textL0textT0 ) . <p> Thus , we find that the two equations ( alpha + beta = 0 ) and ( -beta + gamma = 0 ) govern the behavior of our scaling relation so that ( -alpha = beta = gamma ) . As we 'll see , we can pick an arbitrary value for one of the undetermined exponents and obtain the value of the other two . Choosing ( alpha = -1 ) , we have ( beta=gamma=1 ) so that our dimensionless relation becomes ( r-1vt sim 1 ) , which leads to ( r sim vt ) , the usual relation between position and velocity . Thus , without knowing anything about kinematics , we were able to obtain a defining relation solely using dimensional analysis . Had we picked another value for ( alpha ) , say ( frac65 ) , we 'd still end up with the same scaling relation since we 'd take the ( sqrtfrac65r ) to obtain an integer power for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inconsequential , the scaling conditions demand certain relative values for the exponents , and it is their relative values that govern the system . <p> The technique might not yet seem all that impressive , and ( r=vt ) is perhaps the simplest relation in all of physics and is known intuitively to anyone who 's ever driven a car , or waited for a train . However , the dimensional analysis technique is useful far beyond such a simplistic example , and can produce results in situations where intuition falls flat . All that 's required of the user is to determine which physical quantities should be important , and unimportant for the phenomenon under consideration . <p> Atomic bomb blast radius <p> strangesounds <p> One famous triumph of dimensional analysis was in finding a formula for the blast radius of an exploding atomic bomb as a function of time . Using this scaling relation , it was possible to make accurate estimates of the ( highly classified ) total energy of the US atomic weapon arsenal by looking at photographs of the blast released to newspapers . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ task is to identify the relevant physical quantities . For one , we are interested in the total energy of the bomb , ( E ) , which has units of ( leftEright = textMtextL2textT-2 ) that must be one of our quantities . We 're also interested in the radius of the blast ( r ) , and the time since the explosion ( t ) , which have units of ( textL ) , and ( textT , ) respectively . So they too must be included in our scaling relation . <p> Thus far , we have : <p> Explosive energy of the bomb ( E ) <p> Blast front radius ( r ) <p> Time since explosion ( t ) <p> It seems we have yet to complete our set of scaling variables . For one , we should certainly expect a more rapid expanse of the shock wave when the bomb explodes in air , compared to when it explodes in an ocean of molasses . For another , we notice that our scaling variables currently include only one variable with a unit of mass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relation , so we can not have the bomb energy ( E ) without another mass dependent quantity . <p> What we need to complete our set is the density of the medium into which the bomb explodes , ( rho ) , which has units of ( textMtextL-3 ) . <p> Solving the exponent relations , we find ( alpha = - beta ) , ( delta = 2beta ) , and ( 5beta = -gamma ) . We thus have three equations in four exponent variables , so we are free to choose the value of one of them . Choosing ( alpha = 1 ) , we find ( beta = -1 ) , ( delta = 2 ) , and ( gamma = 5 ) , which makes our scaling relation rho E-1 r5 t2 sim 1 . Thus the radius of the bomb front as a function of time must scale as r sim sqrt5Et2/rho , i.e. r propto t2/5 . <p> This is quite remarkable . Without knowing a single thing about the physics of bomb explosions under heavy atmospheres , we are able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as it explodes into a massive medium . <p> Challenge yourself <p> Using the following timestamped photographs , estimate the explosive energy of the atom bomb used in the Trinity tests . <h> Buckingham Pi Theorem <p> Now that we 've used dimensional analysis to solve a real world problem , it 's a good time to formalize our approach , and say a bit more about what 's going on . So far , our procedure has been to identify ( n ) physical variables ( a , b , c , ldots ) , form a scaling product ( aalpha times bbeta times cdelta times cdots ) , and substitute the ( m ) independent dimensions of our variables to form a system of ( m ) equations in ( n ) variables . Solving these equations yields the exponent values needed to form a dimensionless scaling product , ( pi sim 1 ) . <p> For example , in the atomic bomb problem , we have the following system : <p> We can write this equation as ( mathbfDvece=0 ) , where ( mathbfD ) denotes the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dimensions , and ( vece ) denotes the length-(m) vector of our variables ' exponents in the scaling relation . <p> As yet , this procedure has yielded unique solutions that lead to a single dimensionless product . In general however , such a system will yield a total of ( n-m ) independent solutions , and so we can have multiple dimensionless scaling products ( pi1 , pi2 ) . In such cases , the analysis no longer implies ( pii sim 1 ) , but instead ( g(pi1)=f(pi2) , ) where ( f ) and ( g ) are arbitrary functions . For simplicity , we can say that we have ( pi1 = f(pi2) ) , and in general ( pi1 = f ( pi2 , ldots , pin ) ) . <p> One of the great transformations in physics was the move from Newtonian gravity to the more powerful theory of general relativity . For a time , there was controversy as to whether or not the new theory was correct . One of the major steps in confirming the new theory was in the prediction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Sun . <p> If one assigns the photon a mass of ( E/c = hf/c ) , then it can be shown that in passing the Sun , the photon is deflected through the angle ( thetatextNewton ) . In contrast , general relativity predicts that the bending is instead exactly twice the Newtonian deflection , ( thetatextGR = 2thetatextNewton ) . We wo n't be able to resolve the controversy , but we should be able to estimate the dependence of ( thetatextNewton ) on relevant parameters like the speed of light , the mass of the Sun , and the gravitational constant ( G ) . <p> First of all , we 'd expect the bending of light to change magnitude if either the gravitational constant ( G ) , density of the Sun ( rhotextSun ) , or radius of the Sun ( RtextSun ) were to change . If a classical particle were to pass through the Sun 's gravitational field , we 'd expect its energy , through its velocity , to have an impact on the kind of orbit it would have in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ orbit , gets shifted , or spirals into the Sun 's surface ) , and therefore it is reasonable to expect that the velocity of light ( c ) should come into play . <p> We do n't expect radiation or the light 's frequency to play an important role , and therefore we can probably leave out Boltzmann 's constant ( kB ) , as well as Planck 's constant ( h ) . <p> The units of ( rho ) , as before , are ( textMtextL-3 ) . The speed of light ( c ) gets us units of ( textLtextT ) , and the radius of the Sun ( R ) gives ( textL ) . Now , the gravitational constant has units such that <p> Gfracm2r2 <p> yields units of force , or ( textMtextLtextT-2 ) , and thus we have ( leftGright = textM-1textL3textT-2 ) . <p> Finally , we have our variable of interest ( theta. ) which is already a dimensionless parameter . As we have five variables ( ( n=5 ) ) and three basic dimensions ( ( m=3 ) ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dimensionless products such that ( pi1 = theta = f(pi2) = f ( Galpha rhobeta Rgamma cdelta ) ) . <p> The simplicity of dimensional analysis is also its curse . As we now need to relate two dimensionless quantities , ( pi2 ) can be the argument for almost any function we can imagine , i.e. ( sin ) , ( cos ) , ( tanh-1 ) , ( exp ) , et cetera . However , we can use our intuition to narrow down the possibilities . First , if ( G ) , ( rho ) , or ( R ) increases , we 'd expect the deflection to increase , and we have the inverse expectation the speed of light ( c ) ( ( c ) is obviously a constant , but should it increase , we 'd expect the impact of the Sun on photon trajectory to be diminished , in theory . <p> Now , if we Taylor expand the function ( f ) in ( pi2 ) , we 'd expect no constant term , i.e. if ( G ) , ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or ( c ) is infinite , then we 'd expect no deviation whatsoever , and therefore ( f(0) = 0 ) . Now , the second term in the expansion should be the derivative of ( f ) at zero multiplied by ( pi2 ) . Assuming ( fprime(0)neq 0 ) , we would have ( theta sim pi2 + Oleft(pi22right) sim fracGrho R2c2 ) . Now in fact , this is the correct scaling relation between ( theta ) and the physical quantities ( G , rho , R ) and ( c ) . <p> hubble-lensing <p> We do n't pick up any insight as to whether ( theta approx thetatextNewton , 4thetatextNewton ) or ( 106thetatextNewton ) , but we can say that the light bending depends on the physical parameters according to the scaling relation we 've obtained . Above , we see a dramatic example of light bending through a gravitational field , forming an Einstein ring . <p> Note <p> We had the choice to bring the mass of the gravitating object into the problem either through the density of the object ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the object as one of our physical quantities . We chose to use the density . The reason for this is that the density is a scale free quantity , whereas the mass varies with the radius of the object . Were we to have used ( M ) , we would needlessly complicate our analysis , having two quantities that each scale with ( R ) . Using ( rho ) makes the dependence on planet size transparent . In general , whenever there are multiple ways to represent a given quantity , one of which is scale free , it is usually best to pick the scale free form . <p> A large , spherical , and very diffuse cloud of molecular hydrogen sits in empty space . The radius of the cloud is ( r0 ) and the molecules are initially at rest . Let ( t0 ) be the time it takes for this cloud to completely collapse , i.e. the time it takes for a molecule at ( r0 ) to free-fall into the origin . Similarly , let ( t1 ) be the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to collapse . What is ( t1/t0 ) ? <p> Details and assumptions <p> The entire cloud is collapsing in this process . <p> Both clouds have the same mass . <p> Escape velocity <p> Use dimensional analysis to show that the velocity required for a massive object to escape the gravitational field of a planet scales as ( v sim sqrtGM/R ) . <h> Shortcomings of Dimensional Analysis <p> The benefits of dimensional analysis are clear . The technique is extremely simple to use , and can give us physical intuition where none exists to begin with . With its simplicity comes a number of shortcomings . Although we can usually , very quickly , get to the scaling solution for a problem , dimensional analysis can never yield exact answers in cases of numerical prefactors .

@@77511958 @6211958/ <h> Polarity of a Molecule 26449 @qwx646449 <p> The polarity of a molecule tells whether the electron cloud is equally distributed across the atoms within the molecule , or whether an electronegative atom is affecting the electron density . The distribution of the electrons will affect the behavior and reactivity of the molecule . For example , you can predict which solvents will be most effective with a given chemical if you know its polarity . <p> Water and oil do not mix well , despite the fact that they are both homogenous solutions on their own . This behavior can be explained through a deeper look at the polar forces affecting the two solutions . <h> Contents <h> Definitions <p> When atoms with differing electronegativity are bonded together , the electrons may spend more time around one atom than the other , creating an unequal distribution of charge and a polar bond .

It is possible for a molecule to have polar bonds , but be a non-polar molecule . This occurs when the three-dimensional shape of the molecule is symmetric . For example , carbon dioxide ( left(ceCO2right) ) and methane ( left(ceCH4right) ) are non-polar because their symmetric shapes cancel out the dipole moments to zero , as shown in the figure below . <p> On the other hand , water ( left(ceH2Oright) ) is a polar molecule because the overall dipole moment points toward the oxygen atom ( indicating the oxygen atom is the most electron-rich ) . <h> Significance <p> Polarity is important because it determines whether a molecule is hydrophilic ( from the Greek for water-loving ) or hydrophobic ( from the Greek for water-fearing or water-averse ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mix well with other polar compounds such as water . Molecules that are non-polar or have very low polarity tend to be hydrophobic , and mix well with other non-polar ( or nearly non-polar ) compounds such as oil . <p> Polarity also affects the strength of intermolecular forces . The only intermolecular force that non-polar molecules exhibit is the van der Waals force . Polar molecules can bond with each other via dipole-dipole interactions , which are generally stronger than van der Waals forces .

@@77511959 @6211959/ <h> Quiz 26449 @qwx646449 <p> With electrostatics , the primary object of concern is static electric charges . But what if those charges are free to move ? Very simply put , an ideal conductor is any material whose free electrons can move without any resistance . Of course , there are no perfect conductors , but many metals come amazingly close . <p> Even though our interest lies mostly in understanding the equilibrium ( static ) configuration of conductors , in some ways conductors represent one of the first examples of charges in flux . Using the laws of electrostatics , we can determine , for instance , the behavior of metal objects following perturbation , such as the introduction of an external electric field . <p> The basic properties of conductors allow us to describe many physical phenomena . Consider the following man standing inside a thin metal wire frame . Why is it that he does not flinch even while sparks are flying from a Tesla coil held at hundreds of thousands of volts ? <h> Contents <h> Basic Properties of Conductors <p> The easiest way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fundamental property . <p> Conductor Property 1 . <p> Inside the material of a conductor at equilibrium , the electric field is always zero . <p> Since charge is always free to flow until it reaches an equilibrium , the electric field must be zero for the very simple reason that if electric field were nonzero , the charge would move . Now , if the conductor is disturbed by an external field ( suppose that an external electric charge was brought close ) , the charges in the conductor will move , but after a short instant , the charges will reorient themselves into a stable , equilibrium configuration in which the electric field is zero . In general , the reorientation happens quite quickly , so to a good approximation the charges inside a conductor can be thought of as moving essentially instantaneously . <p> Several corollaries immediately follow from Property 1 . <p> Since the the electric field is zero , the electric potential must be constant . In other words , a conductor is an equipotential surface . Recall that <p> Delta V = int textbfE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so ( Delta V = 0 ) . <p> Conductor Property 2 . <p> Inside the material of a conductor at equilibrium , the potential difference between any two points is zero . <p> Since the electric field inside a conductor is zero ( ( mathbfE = 0 ) , it follows directly from the differential form of Gauss 's law that there can also be no net charge ( rho = 0 ) inside a conductor . However , some charge can reside on the surface of the conductor , where the charges are held from escaping the material entirely . <p> Conductor Property 3 . <p> Inside the material of a conductor at equilibrium , there is no net charge any any point inside the conductor . All net charge ( if any ) resides on the surface or surfaces of the conductor . <p> Although there is charge on the surface of a conductor , it is locked in a static configuration at equilibrium . As a result , the electric field at the surface of the conductor must be perpendicular to the surface . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then charge would flow along the surface , which would contradict the assumption that it is in equilibrium . <p> Conductor Property 4 . <p> The electric field at the surface of a conductor at equilibrium is perpendicular to the surface . <p> Although the distribution of the induced charge is not always easy to calculate directly , it is possible to establish some general principles about the interaction of conductors and internal and external charges . <p> A collection of objects with total charge ( Q ) is placed inside of a hollow conductor that is initially neutral . What is the total charge on ( a ) the inner and ( b ) the outer surfaces of the conductor ? <p> Between the two surfaces of the conductor , the electric field is zero , so Gauss 's law gives that the total charge contained within a Gaussian surface enveloping the inner surface and the charged objects must be zero . Therefore , the inner surface must contain charge ( - Q ) . Since the conductor is initially neutral , the outer surface must contain charge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ total charge ( Q ) is placed inside of a spherical hollow conductor that is initially neutral . What is the field outside of the conductor ? <p> As in the previous example , the inner surface acquires induced charge ( -Q ) , and the outer surface acquires induced charge ( Q ) . But what is the distribution of the induced charge ? Consider what would happen if we were somehow able to remove the outer surface charge ( Q ) " on their own , the charge from the inner surface induced charge cancels with the charge from the charged objects at all of the points outside of the cavity . Thus , the charge ( Q ) on the outer cavity simply redistributes uniformly as it would on a uniformly charged sphere . Therefore , the field outside of the conductor simply looks like that of a uniformly charged sphere of charge ( Q ) . 1 <p> Note that the geometry of the inner surface and the positions of the charged objects was irrelevant . In other words , a hollow conductor " hides " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only be able to ascertain the outer geometry due to the external field formed from the charge ( Q ) on the spherical outer surface , but you would not be able to determine the anything about the charges contained in the inner surface and cavity . <h> Electrostatic Shielding <p> One of the key phenomena involving conductors is electrostatic shielding . No matter what charge is brought close to an ideal conductor , the charges inside the conductor will always reorient themselves , by definition , so that ( textbfE = 0 ) inside the conductor . This means that the surfaces of the conductor will become charged , but the induced charge will be distributed such that sum of the total field from the surfaces of the conductor and the field from the external charge is zero inside the conductor . <p> Therefore , a conductor with a hollow cavity can be used to shield an object from external electrostatic fields , as illustrated by the man standing unscathed inside the Faraday cage at the beginning of this Wiki . ( Even though the material that makes up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such that the field inside the cage is minimal . ) It must be the case that ( textbfE = 0 ) inside the cavity because certainly ( textbfE = 0 ) inside a solid conductor . Removal of material from the inside of the solid conductor can be done without disturbing the charges on the outer surface , thus producing a hollow conductor which also has the property ( textbfE = 0 ) inside . Alternatively , there is also a proof of the same fact due to Gauss ' law , which is left as an exercise . <p> An electric field is uniform throughout a certain region of space . Its magnitude is ( 10mboxV/m ) . A conducting sphere of radius ( R=1mboxcm ) and charge ( Q=1mumboxC ) is then placed in this region . Determine the magnitude of the electric field at the center of the sphere . <h> Laplace 's Equation and Induced Charge <p> Suppose one wishes to determine completely the field of some charges and conductors . Equivalently , all one needs is the electric potential ( V ) defined as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ empty space surrounding the conductors , Gauss ' law implies that ( nabla cdot mathbfE = 0 ) , so <p> nabla2 V = 0 , <p> a result known as Laplace 's equation . In principle , given the potential of each conductor in the system , one can solve for ( V ) everywhere . In some ways , Laplace 's equation represents the most general possible statement of Coulomb 's law ( and , equivalently , Gauss 's law ) . <p> Note that to arrive at a unique solution , the potential of the conductors must be specified . After all , Laplace 's equation does not " know " if there is a conductor sitting somewhere . Information that must be specified about the potentials the system are known as the boundary conditions . In addition , one must usually also specify that the potential vanishes at infinity . For instance , if a conducting sheet is placed on the ( xy ) -plane , the corresponding boundary conditions would include that the potential is constant at ( z = 0 ) ( ( V @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constant ( V0 ) ) and that the potential goes to zero as ( x2 + y2 + z2 ) becomes large . <p> Discussion on general techniques for solving Laplace 's equation is deferred to the references at the end of this Wiki . Regardless , in many cases , Laplace 's equation is impractical to solve directly . Except in a handful of special cases , it has no closed-form analytic solution , and even when neat solutions exist , they are not always easy to find . Instead , we focus on one of many clever methods for indirectly arriving at a solution to Laplace 's equation . One key mathematical result that simplifies things greatly is the so-called uniqueness theorem . <p> Uniqueness theorem . If there exists a valid solution ( V(textbfr) ) satisfying the boundary conditions , then ( V ) is the only solution . <p> How does the uniqueness theorem help ? If one can , say , find a valid configuration of charges that creates a potential satisfying Laplace 's equations and the boundary conditions , then the potential associated with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's equation , no matter how one arrives at that solution . Fortunately , it turns out that simple guessing and reasoning often allows us to arrive at the correct answer , which must be the only answer by the uniqueness theorem . Consider the following problem . <p> A point charge of charge ( q ) is brought a distance ( d ) away from an infinite conducting sheet . What is the distribution of charge on the sheet and the resulting electric field ? <p> The conducting sheet imposes the requirement that the potential along its surface must be constant . Equivalently , the electric field must be perpendicular at all points along the sheet . I claim that we already know one such distribution that satisfies this condition : the system of two opposite point charges . <p> If a point charge of charge ( -q ) is placed a distance ( d ) from the sheet directly across from the first charge , then the resulting potential satisfies the boundary condition , as the plane dividing the two charges is an equipotential , with field lines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must satisfy Laplace 's equation because it is a valid electrostatic distribution . ) It follows from the uniqueness theorem that this must must be the only solution to the system . Therefore , the potential and electric field above the sheet are identical to that of the two-charge system . <p> However , the uniqueness theorem says nothing about what happens below the sheet , where the field must be zero . We can reason that from far away , the sheet looks a conducting sphere , inside which the field vanishes . <p> Meanwhile , the charge distribution can be found simply from using Gauss 's law , which gives that the surface charge density must be ( sigma = epsilon0 E ) , where ( E ) is the component of the electric field perpendicular to the sheet at that point . ( The precise calculation of ( E ) is left as an exercise for the reader . ) <p> Two charges are placed above an infinite conducting sheet as shown . The first has charge ( -6q ) and is placed a distance ( d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 6q ) and is placed a distance ( d ) directly above the first ( so that it is a total distance ( 2d ) away from the sheet ) . <h> References <p> 1 There is one slight subtlety to this argument , namely the claim that the inner surface induced charge must cancel the cavity charge for points outside of the conductor . This may not be true a priori , but in the end , since there exists a distribution such that the charges cancel , the uniqueness theorem tells us that this must be the correct distribution .

@@77511965 @6211965/ 26449 @qwx646449 <p> Chemical equilibrium refers to the final mixture of a chemical reaction , where the reactants and products are done changing . In a chemical reaction , reactants are converted into products . A general belief is that all chemical reactions proceed to completion ( where all reactants are converted into product ) . But this is not true in all cases . A lot of chemical reactions proceed only to a certain extent , i.e. the reactants are not fully converted into products and the resulting mixture contains both reactants and products . After sometime , the concentration of reactants or products becomes constant and we get a state of equilibrium for the system . <p> For example , in Haber 's process for ammonia ( ( ceNH3 ) ) manufacture , ammonia is only 15% of the equilibrium mixture , even at optimized temperature and pressure condition : <h> Reversible and irreversible reaction <h> Irreversible reaction <p> A chemical reaction which proceeds only in forward direction so that the reactants are converted into products and products do not react with each other to reform reactants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Neutralization reaction like ( ceHCl+ceNaOH to ceNaCl+ceH2O ) is an example of an irreversible reaction . <h> Reversible reaction <p> A chemical reaction in which reactants react together to form products and products formed react with each other directly to reform the original reactant back is known as a reversible reaction . ( square ) <p> Reaction of hydrogen with iodine ( ceH2+ceI2 rightleftharpoons 2ceHI ) is an example of a reversible reaction . <h> Law of Chemical Equilibrium <p> Consider an elementary reversible reaction taking place in a closed container : <p> aceA+bceB rightleftharpoons cceC+dceD . <p> Where A and B react to produce C and D , while the products C and D can also react to produce A and B back . <p> Initially only the reactants A and B are present , and thus their concentration is maximum .

But as the reaction progresses , concentration of A and B decreases and on the other hand concentration of C and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down and the rate of backward reaction goes on increasing . <p> Ultimately a state is reached when the rate of forward reaction becomes equal to the rate of backward reaction and the system attains equilibrium . After that , there will be no change in concentration of any of the species . <h> Characteristics of chemical equilibrium <p> These are some of the characteristics of chemical equilibrium . <p> The chemical reaction should be reversible . <p> The equilibrium can be attained only if the system is closed , i.e. the reaction should be carried out in a closed vessel . <p> The opposing processes ( i.e. forward and backward reactions ) occur at the same rate and there is a dynamic but stable condition . <p> The observable properties of the system such as concentration , pressure , color , etc. becomes constant at equilibrium and remains unchanged thereafter . <p> By bringing a change in conditions such as temperature , pressure or concentration , the equilibrium point can be shifted to the right or left hand side as required . Thus the reaction can be controlled to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be approached from either direction . <p> A catalyst does not alter the equilibrium point . It only increases the rate of reaction . The equilibrium is attained however . <h> Law of mass action <p> Statement : For a homogeneous system at a constant temperature , the rate at which a substance reacts is proportional to its active mass and the rate of a chemical reaction is proportional to the product of active masses of the reacting substances at that moment . <p> The ratio ( dfrackfkb ) is called equilibrium constant of reaction and is denoted by ( Kc : ) <p> LONG ... <p> Equilibrium constant is independent of initial concentrations and pressure and is a function of temperature alone .

For practical purpose , time required for ( Cae=33.34 ) is enough . <p> We know a catalyst increases rate of reaction without itself actually getting consumed . But here the question is whether it will change the equilibrium concentrations of ( ceA ) and ( ceB . ) The answer is simply no . It increases both rate constants to the same extent so that the ratio of rate constants that is ( Kc ) is the same as in non-catalytic reaction . For a proof see How does catalyst work . <p> For finding time required for equilibrium , we proceed as follows : <p> We have increased rate constants for both forward and backward reactions in catalytic reaction as <p> Try to solve this equation by integration factor method as we did above and get the final equation <p> Ca=frac1003+frac200e-6t3 . <p> Putting ( Cae=frac1003 ) and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we did above in case of non-catalytic reaction . i.e. ( t=infty ) .

So in total we will have ( 66.67+33.33=100text mol ) ( ceB ) and ( 33.33+16.6667=50text mol ) ( ceA . ) Hence we will have more ( ceB ) at equilibrium . <p> You can point out that percentage of ( ceB ) in equilibrium mixture is the same in both cases ( ( 66.67 ) % ) .

Look how current always leads the voltage . <p> The following proof is to calculate the average power developed in a purely capacitive circuit over one time period <p> We know that total power in any circuit is given by ( VI ) . For the case of a capacitor , this can be written as : <p> But , we know that the average of ( sine ) function over an entire cycle is zero , therefore <p> bar P = 0 <p> It must be remembered that although capacitive circuits do dissipate power at an instant , but the average power is what 's zero for the circuit . <h> Inductor in an AC circuit <p> In a purely inductive circuit , we use the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circuit .

This is because in both these cases , the phase difference between voltage and current is same i.e. ( frac pi2 ) which results in the average power of the circuit to come out to be 0 . <h> RLC Circuit ( Series ) <p> So , after learning about the effects of attaching various components individually , we will consider the basic set-up of an RLC circuit consisting of a resistor , an inductor and a capacitor combined in series to an external current supply which is alternating in nature , as shown in the diagram . <p> The components are in series , so as a result the current passing through them will be the same .

Phasor diagrams are such diagrams , that represent these scalar quantities with a direction and help us to compute our results better . <p> DERIVATION USING PHASOR DIAGRAMS <p> Since the current through all the components is same , we construct a ray ( OQ ) that shows the direction of the current , which will be same for all the components .

We get something like this : <p> Looking at the diagram , we see three vectors ( OA ) , ( OB ) and ( OQ ) which represent voltages across single components . Using basic vector algebra , and considering potential drop across capacitor to be more than that for the inductor , we see that the net voltage is along the diagonal of the so formed parallelogram ( COPD ) , and is given by the vector ( OD ) .

Also , the average of ( cos ( 2omega t+phi ) ) across one cycle is 0 . So , we get the final formula for average power to be : <p> Here ( omega r ) represents the resonant frequency of the circuit , or the frequency of the applied voltage that causes a condition of resonance .

Quite basically , such a device can be viewed to consist of an LCR circuit in it . When it receives an electromagnetic signal of some frequency , then this signal is converted into an electrical signal which tends to be the AC source for the circuit . Now , for every channel , there 's a particular configuration of inductor and capacitor used . So , if the received frequency matches with resonant frequency for that particular channel , then the current in that circuit goes to maximum and the signal is said to accepted . <p> On the other hand , if it does not match the resonant frequency , then the current stays less than the maximum current and the signal is said to be rejected or denied . <p> Power in a resonating LCR circuit <p> We know that average power of any LCR circuit can be given by : ( bar P = V rms I rms cos phi ) <p> But , for a circuit in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be easily inferred that ( phi=0 ) , or ( cos phi =1 ) .

Both the horizontal and vertical positioning of an element within the table give clues as to that element 's behavior , making the periodic table a quick and useful reference for predicting how certain elements will react with each other . <h> Reading the Periodic Table <p> Each box on the table represents one element . Basic information about the element is included on every periodic table , including : <p> The name of the element <p> The one or two letter atomic symbol <p> The atomic number , which is the number of protons in the atom 's nucleus <p> The atomic mass in atomic mass units ( or AMUs , where one AMU is equal to 1/12 the mass of a carbon-12 atom , or about 1.66 x 10-27 kg ) . ( Note : the terms atomic mass and atomic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ definitions . Atomic weight is calculated based on the atomic masses and relative abundances of all naturally occurring isotopes of an element . ) <h> History <p> In the 1800 's scientists across Europe were working on the same puzzle : making sense of the patterns of behavior observed in chemical elements and developing a systematic way of organizing those elements . <p> While specific pieces of these early classifications fit well , no system accommodated all of the approximately 60 known elements . <p> These early chemists faced two hurdles . First , they knew there were more elements to be discovered and incorporated into the periodic table . Second , some of the published information about the elements was known to be wrong . The puzzle had both missing and torn pieces , making it even harder to put together . <p> Russian chemist Dmitri Mendeleev is often called " the father of the periodic table . " In 1869 , he published a version with 63 elements arranged by atomic weight , showing that when the elements were arranged that way , certain characteristics were periodically repeated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the German chemistry journal Zeitschrift f-r Chemie in 1869 . <p> Putting the elements in the correct place on the table still sometimes required correcting their atomic mass . Sometimes Mendeleev decided the atomic mass must be wrong because the elements seemed to appear in the wrong order . He placed tellurium before iodine , for example , even though tellurium is heavier . Iodine 's properties are much more similar to those of fluorine , chlorine and bromine than to oxygen , sulfur and selenium , and the opposite is true for tellurium . <p> Mendeleev 's table had impressive predictive power . He left blank spaces on the table where he thought undiscovered elements would fit . He predicted several properties for five of those elements , including atomic weight , melting point , density of the solid , and valency . By 1875 , three of those elements ( gallium , germanium , and scandium ) had been discovered by independent researchers in France , Germany , and Sweden , giving further credibility to Mendeleev 's periodic table . <h> Modern Periodic Law <p> The modern periodic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a young English physicist , carried out research regarding the structure of the atom and came to the conclusion that atomic number , the number of protons in the nucleus , is the fundamental property of an element rather than the atomic mass . This explained some of the inconsistencies Mendeleev was finding . Tellurium is number 52 and iodine is 53 , for example . <p> Moseley 's Modern Periodic Law : <p> Properties of the elements are the periodic function of their atomic numbers . <p> Periodic tables can contain a variety of extra information . This one tells the phase of the pure element at room temperature and notes which elements were created synthetically , rather than discovered in nature . Public domain image from the National Institute of Standards and Technology ( NIST ) <p> Advantages of the modern periodic table include : <p> The classification of the elements is based on the fundamental property of their atomic number . <p> The position of an element is determined by the electronic configuration of the outer valence , which naturally groups elements with similar chemical properties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shells , are placed at the end of each period . <p> It provides a clear demarcation between different kinds of elements such as metals , non-metals , metalloids , transition elements , inert gases , lanthanides , and actinides . <p> Deficiencies of the modern periodic table include : <p> The position of hydrogen is unresolved . <p> There is no place for lanthanides and actinides in the main body of the table . <p> The arrangement is unable to reflect the electronic configuration of many elements in the transition group , lanthanides , and actinides . <h> Groups <p> The vertical columns of the table are called groups . Groups have the same electron configuration in their outermost shell , or valence . Roman numerals are used to indicate the group number , which is also the number of electrons in the outer valence . There are two sets of groups : A and B. A , the representative elements , have the valence electrons in s or p sub-shells . The non-representative elements of group B are the transition metals , which have partially filled d sub-shells @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ f sub-shells . Groups with distinct properties the general chemistry student should be familiar with are discussed below . <p> Alkali Metals , group IA , have many of the characteristic physical properties of metals . Each alkali metal has a single electron in its valence <p> Halogens , group VIIA . With seven valence electrons , halogens are close to having a complete octet , making them highly reactive . They can easily strip an electron from a positively-charged cation , forming anions with a -1 charge ( ( Cl- , F- ) , etc . ) <p> Noble Gases , group VIII , are also called the inert gases . Their complete valence shell is energetically favorable , making them relatively nonreactive . They have low boiling points and are gases at room temperature . <h> Periods <p> The horizontal rows of the table are called periods . There are seven periods , and they are filled sequentially . They represent the principal quantum numbers ( n=1 ) to ( n=7 ) . Arabic numerals are used when referring to the periods . <p> Periodicity is the repetition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ group separated by a certain definite gaps of atomic numbers . <p> In other words , periodicity is the idea that elements in a group have similar chemical properties because they have the same valence shell electronic configuration . All elements will gain or lose electrons to reach a stable octet , the valence configuration of the noble gases , leading to some general trends across the periodic table . <p> Going from left to right , electrons are added to the outer valence one at a time . The more electrons there are in the outer shell , the stronger the nuclear attraction . Properties of the vertical groups also factor into periodic trends . Most notably , the number of filled shells increases going down the periodic table . With more electrons between the outer valence and the nucleus , the outer valence is less tightly bound . Together , these two factors explain the following periodic trends : <p> Atomic Radius describes the size of the electrons ' orbitals around the nucleus of an atom . The atomic radii decrease from left to right within a period @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Ionization Energy is the energy required to remove an electron from an atom or ion . The closer the electron is to the nucleus , the more difficult it is to remove . Ionization energy increases from left to right within a period and from bottom to top within a group . <p> Electronegativity measures how strongly an atom is attracted to electrons when it forms a chemical bond . Electronegativity increases from left to right within a period and also from bottom to top within a group . <p> Electron Affinity is a way of measuring how easily an atom can accept an electron . A positive electron affinity indicates that energy is being released when the electron is added . Generalizations for electron affinity can be made for groups within the periodic table by looking at their valence state . For example , the halogens have a high electron affinity because they need one electron to make an octet , while the noble gases have an electron affinity around 0 because they already have an octet . <p> Considering its chemical properties and the ions it makes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ periodic table ? <p> Group II A , the alkaline earth metals There is no perfectly suited place for hydrogen Group I A , the alkali metals Group VII A , the halogens <h> Blocks of The Periodic Table <h> Screening Effect <h> Lanthanide Contraction <h> New Elements <p> In December 2015 , International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry ( IUPAC ) announced that four new elements had been discovered and synthesized by laboratories in The United States , Russia , and Japan . <p> With these new elements , the seventh period of the table is now complete . <p> The process of naming the elements and giving them two letter symbols will take several months and include a period for public comment . The elements are temporarily named as ununtrium , ( Uut or element 113 ) , ununpentium ( Uup , element 115 ) , ununseptium ( Uus , element 117 ) , and ununoctium ( Uuo , element 118 ) . New elements can be named after a mythological concept , a mineral , a place , or a scientist . 1 <h> Other Arrangements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capture all the patterns and relationships found among the elements . Several alternatives have been proposed to highlight electron configurations or quantum numbers , among other traits . Circular and 3-dimensional versions have been drawn , which eliminate some of the questions regarding the placement of hydrogen and the exclusion of lanthanides and actinides from the main body of the table . <p> The ADOMAH periodic table highlights electron configurations <p> Theodore Benfey 's spiral format was first published in the 1960 's <h> Interactive Periodic Tables <p> The periodic table2 hosted by Los Alamos National Laboratory includes a short article describing the history , properties , and uses of each element . <p> The University of Nottingham has a website called Periodic Videos3 that features experiments exploring the properties of the different elements , including plenty of explosions .

When the algorithm terminates , if there was an unmatched vertex in ( A , ) then it would have proposed matching to an unmatched vertex in ( B ) and that proposal would have been accepted . <p> To see that the matching is stable , suppose that there is ( a in A ) and ( b in B ) that are unmatched and each prefers the other .

When handling large amounts of traffic over a large quantity of servers , you need to decide which server to send traffic to . The traffic 's preferences are generally the costs , which could be money or time related , associated with using certain servers .

You can backtrack to continue the search for a good leaf by revoking your most recent choice , and trying out the next option in that set of options . If you run out of options , revoke the choice that got you here , and try another choice at that node . If you end up at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaves to be found . <p> Backtracking is essential for solving constraint satisfaction problems , such as crosswords , verbal arithmetic , Sudoku , and many other puzzles . It is also used in solving the knapsack problem , parsing texts and other combinatorial optimization problems . <p> What 's interesting about backtracking is that we back up only as far as needed to reach a previous decision point with an as-yet-unexplored alternative . In general , that will be at the most recent decision point . Eventually , more and more of these decision points will have been fully explored , and we will have to backtrack further and further . If we backtrack all the way to our initial state and have explored all alternatives from there , we can conclude the particular problem is unsolvable . In such a case , we will have done all the work of the exhaustive recursion and known that there is no viable solution possible . <h> Contents <h> Permutations <p> A permutation of a given set of items is a certain rearrangement of the elements .

The same single integer may not appear twice in the same row , column or sub-grid . <p> Let us look at a simplified ( 3times3 ) mini version of the original Sudoku puzzle . Here , each cell is a subgrid containing ( 1 ) element and is trivial distinct . This means we only need to check if the rows and columns contain the integers ( 1 ) , ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) with no repetitions . <p> Below is an example of a mini Sudoku puzzle(left) and its solution ( right ) <p> It should be obvious by now that this puzzle is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pseudocode that will help us solve it . <p> 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 <p> function solve ( board ) if the board contains no invalid cells , ie.cells that violate the rules : if it is also completely filled out then return true for each cell in the board if the cell is empty for each number in 1,2,3 replace the current cell with number if solve(board) and the board is valid return true else backtrack return false <p> The code above is a classic example of backtracking .

A robot can for example plan its path in a maze by recurring over the paths and backtracking from the ones that lead no where . This ofcourse requires us to represent the maze in a way that the algorithm is compatible with . A common method is to use a ( 2-d ) matrix and values within it to represent obstacles or paths . Below is a simplified version of the maze solving problem that should help clarify the backtracking algorithm . <h> The Simplified Path Finding Problem <p> Given an ( N times N ) matrix of blocks with a source upper left block , we want to find a path from the source to the destination ( the lower right block ) .

This does not sound good but having a large number of constraints actually allows us to significantly reduce the search space when we are backtracking . This also means a substantial improvement in run time and performance . <h> An example of a solution <h> Image Credit : wikipedia <p> A very common example of backtracking in computer science is the problem of placing ( N ) queens on a checkers board in a way that no two queens attack each other .

@@77511979 @6211979/ <h> Contents <h> Motivation <p> The Biot-Savart law requires summing many infinitesimal current elements and thus allows for the direct calculation of any configuration of magnetic field due to current-carrying wires . As with Coulomb 's law in electrostatics , this type of sum can get quite complicated . <p> Analogous to electrostatics , in which Gauss ' law allows for the convenient calculation of the electric field of systems with symmetry , in magnetostatics Amp+re 's law can be used to readily determine the magnetic field of symmetric systems of current elements . <p> Recall that the motivation for Gauss ' law ( in its integral form ) makes a statement of the relation between regional charge distribution and the electric field summed over a surface ( in the form of electric flux ) . Likewise , when considering paths of current elements , one might consider the magnetic field over an entire path . ( In magnetostatics , it intuitively makes sense to consider paths ( and not surfaces as with electrostatics ) , as one is concerned with current carrying paths . ) <p> Just as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with an alternative statement of the Biot-Savart law , one might aspire to sum the magnetic field over a closed directed path , or a so-called Amperian loop . And , similarly , instead of considering the total charge contained inside a Gaussian surface , here one considers the total current enclosed by an Amperian loop . As with a Gaussian surface , with an Amperian loop there is an orientation to the loop . In general , one defines the positive orientation of the loop as the counterclockwise direction . This convention can be remembered by curling the fingers on one 's right hand around one 's thumb ( the so-called " right hand rule " ) . <p> To see how this might be related to current-carrying elements , consider the following Amperian loops shown below , which are of different sizes . A single current-carrying wire ( pointing out of the page ) passes through each figure as shown . <p> Consider the sum of the magnetic field over the top two loops . In particular , let the component of the magnetic field tangent to each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which is represented by the integral <p> inttextloop mathbfB cdot dmathbfs , <p> which is a so-called line integral . In a great many cases ( such as constant ( mathbfB cdot dmathbfs ) ) , the integral will not have to be computed directly from the definition . Instead , symmetry arguments may suffice to obtain the value of the integral . <p> In the first loop , the the path itself is quite small , but the magnetic field is strong close to the wire . In the large loop below it , the path is much larger , but the magnetic field is much weaker . Indeed , by the Biot-Savart law , one knows that the field weakens by exactly a factor ( 1/r ) , where ( r ) is the radius of the loop . Thus , the linear change in the size of a circular loop is exactly balanced out by the decrease in the strength of the magnetic field at the location of the loop . In other words , the sum of the magnetic field over the direction of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ r = mu0 I , <p> which is independent of ( r ) . Thus , it is not unreasonable to consider that perhaps the physical dimensions of a loop does not matter so much as the current ( I ) contained with the loop . If a loop is farther away from a current source , then its path is longer , but the corresponding field strength decreases proportionally with the increase in path length . <p> One might also consider the following Amperian loop . <p> The field through the two circular arc segments cancel by the previous reasoning . Along one of the arcs , the sum of the field over the loop is some fraction of ( mu0 I ) , while along the other , the sum must be the exact opposite ( but same magnitude ) due to the reversed direction of the path . Furthermore , along the radially-oriented segments , the sum of the field must be zero because all of the components of the field are perpendicular to the radial direction . Thus , the sum of the field of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passes through interior of the loop , and no net magnetic field arises when summed over the loop . A similar argument could be made for any general loop that does not contain any current elements . <p> Indeed , by drawing an analogy with Gauss ' law , one might conjecture the following : - The integral of the magnetic field over an Amperian loop is independent of the geometry or size of the loop . - The integral depends only on the current contained within the loop . In particular , the integral is proportional to the current contained inside the loop . ( Furthermore , based on the calculation for the circular loops , the constant of proportionality must be ( mu0 ) . ) - As a corollary , the integral is zero when no current passes through the interior of the loop . <h> Amp+re 's Law <p> The integral form of Amp+re 's law can be stated as follows . It can be shown to be equivalent to the Biot-Savart law . <p> Amp+re 's law ( integral form ) . Given a **25;2607;TOOLONG @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ current ( Itextencl ) is enclosed , <p> As with Gauss ' law , which can be used to calculate the total charge distribution from the field or vice versa , Amp+re 's law can be used to determine the field or enclosed current in situations with some symmetry . A clever choice of Amperian loop is often needed to exploit the symmetry of a given system . <p> Note that care must be taken to orient the loop correctly with respect to the direction of the current . With the loop oriented counterclockwise in the page , all currents passing out of the page are positive , while those going into the page are negative . <p> Field of a current-carrying wire . To calculate the magnetic field from a current-carrying wire of current ( I ) , we choose a circular Amperian loop of radius ( r ) centered at the wire . Because ( mathbfB cdot dmathbfs ) is constant , it follows that <p> B ( 2pi r ) = mu0 I <p> B = fracmu0 I2pi r , <p> where ( B ) is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Suppose that one has a cylindrical solenoid , a coil of wire wrapped around a cylindrical core . A side view of the solenoid is as shown below . If the solenoid ( measured along its axis ) is long compared to its radius , then the field inside the solenoid near the middle is very nearly constant due to symmetry . <p> We choose a rectangular Amperian loop such that the one side of the loop is on the interior of the solenoid and one sits outside . The side outside of the loop can be chosen to be sufficiently far away from the solenoid such that it feels a negligible field . <p> The field integrated over the two sides of the loop perpendicular to the axis of the solenoid must come out to zero , for both sides feel the same field at all corresponding points along their paths but in opposite orientations . If the length of the side of path inside the solenoid is ( L ) , then F gives <p> B L = mu0 N I , <p> where ( N ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( L ) . Instead writing ( n = N/L ) as the density of turns ( in number of turns per unit length ) , one has <p> B = mu0 n I. <p> In other words , the field strength depends only the current and density of turns , not the total number . <p> If both sides of the Amperian loop parallel to the axis are instead chosen to reside outside of the solenoid , then instead Amp+re 's law gives <p> B L = 0 , <p> so there is zero field outside of the solenoid . <p> Field inside a thick wire . A thick wire of outer radius ( R ) carries steady current distributed uniformly over the wire . What is the field inside and outside of the of the wire if the total current is ( I ) ? <p> Once again , we choose a circular Amperian loop of radius ( r ) centered at the axis of the wire . <p> Outside , the wire ( ( r &gt; R ) ) , Amp+re 's law gives the same result @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ = fracmu0 I2pi r . <p> Inside the wire ( ( r leq R ) ) , the total current enclosed is ( I(r2/R2) ) , so Amp+re 's law gives <p> B ( 2pi r ) = mu0 I ( r2/R2 ) <p> B = fracmu0 I r2pi R2 . <p> Since the total current increases quadratically with ( r ) while the decay of the field ( for the current elements inside the loop ) occurs proportionally to ( 1/r ) , the field as a whole increases linearly with ( r ) . <p> A coaxial cable consists of an inner solid cylindrical wire of radius ( 2 , textmm ) and an outer conducting hollow cylinder of radius ( 4 , textmm ) , which each carry a current of magnitude ( 100 , textmA ) .

It is the generalized , continuous version of the current ( I ) . Of course , the surface integral in both equations can be taken over any chosen closed surface , so the integrands must be equal : <p> nabla times mathbfB = mu0 mathbfJ . <p> This is the so-called differential form of Amp+re 's law , as it expresses Amp+re 's law in terms of a differential operator , the curl . <h> Maxwell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ triumphs of physics , perhaps the most brilliant between the eras of Newton and Einstein , in the mid-nineteenth century Maxwell showed that the " naive " form of Amp+re 's law that has been used is necessarily inadequate , or at the very least , not fully generalized .

This is the principle behind the electrolytic cells . The process may look complicated but it 's just like a cake walk . <h> Contents <h> Electrolysis <p> Electrolysis is defined as a process of decomposition of an electrolyte by the passage of electricity through its aqueous solution or molten ( fused ) state . <p> Electrolytic cell <p> The apparatus used to bring about electrolysis is electrolytic cell.It consists of a vessel containing electrolytes either as a aqueous solution or in molten state.Two metal rods are dipped into it and are connected to two terminal of a electricity source.These rods are called electrodes ; the one connected to negative pole of the battery is called cathode and other connected to the positive pole is called anode . <p> Mechanism of electrolysis <p> During electrolysis a electrolyte is decomposed into positive and negative ions.Positive ions are attracted to cathode ( negative electrode ) , accept electron @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ towards anode ( positive electrode ) , lose electron and become neutral .

Here is a guide to find square root or rather their approximates . <h> Contents <h> A formula for square root approximation <p> Let ( n ) be the number whose square root we need to calculate .

@@77512005 @6212005/ <h> Jordan " H+lder Theorem 26449 @qwx646449 <p> The Jordan " H+lder Theorem is a theorem about composition series of finite groups . A composition series is a chain of subgroups 1 = H0 triangleleft H1 triangleleft H2 triangleleft cdots triangleleft Hk-1 triangleleft Hk = G , where ( Hi ) is a maximal proper normal subgroup of ( Hi+1 . ) By the third isomorphism theorem , this is equivalent to the statement that the quotient ( Hi+1/Hi ) is a simple group . This quotient is called a composition factor . <p> It is not hard to show that every finite group ( G ) has a composition series . The Jordan " H+lder Theorem states that any two composition series of the same group have the same length and the same composition factors ( up to permutation ) . <p> The cyclic group ( mathbb Z6 ) has two composition series : 1 triangleleft mathbb Z3 triangleleft mathbb Z6 , , textand , , 1 triangleleft mathbb Z2 triangleleft mathbb Z6 . Here , ( mathbb Z3 ) is isomorphic to the subgroup ( 0,2,4 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) is isomorphic to the subgroup ( 0,3 . ) Note that both composition series have the same length , and both have the same composition factors , but in a different order : ( mathbb Z6/mathbb Z3 cong mathbb Z2 ) and ( mathbb Z6/mathbb Z2 cong mathbb Z3 . ) <h> Contents <h> Background <p> Here is a discussion of two assertions made in the introduction : that every finite group has a composition series , and that ( Hi ) being a maximal normal subgroup of ( Hi+1 ) is equivalent to saying that ( Hi+1/Hi ) is simple . <p> It is clear that every finite group has a composition series . To show that a maximal normal subgroup exists : the trivial subgroup is normal in every group , and if it is not maximal , there must be a larger normal subgroup containing it . Continue looking for larger normal subgroups until finding one that is maximal . The process is finite because the group is finite . The maximal normal subgroup is ( Hk-1 . ) Run the same process on subgroups of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that normal subgroups of ( G/N ) are in one-to-one correspondence with normal subgroups of ( G ) containing ( N , ) via the natural correspondence coming from the standard homomorphism ( pi colon G to G/N . ) So ( Hi ) is maximal in ( Hi+1 ) if and only if there is no normal subgroup strictly containing ( Hi ) and strictly contained in ( Hi+1 , ) which corresponds to there being no normal subgroup in ( Hi+1/Hi ) which is strictly bigger than ( 1 ) and strictly smaller than the whole quotient . This is the same as saying that ( Hi+1/Hi ) is simple . <p> Warning : Normality is not a transitive relation . That is , if ( K ) is normal in ( H ) and ( H ) is normal in ( G , ) it is not necessarily true that ( K ) is normal in ( G. ) Each of the subgroups in a composition series is normal in the succeeding one , but not necessarily normal in ( G ) itself . For example , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Z2 triangleleft V4 triangleleft A4 triangleleft S4 ( see the simple group wiki for a derivation ) , but ( mathbb Z2 , ) the subgroup generated by a double transposition , is not normal in ( S4 . ) <p> Then ( k=ell ) and the list of composition factors is unique up to permutation , that is : the lists ( Hi+1/Hi ) and ( Kj+1/Kj ) are the same , after rearranging one of the lists suitably . <h> Applications <p> Unique factorization : The Jordan " H+lder Theorem can be viewed as a generalization of the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic , that every integer can be factored as a product of prime numbers , essentially uniquely ( up to permutation of the factors ) . <p> In fact , it is not hard to show that the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic follows from Jordan " H+lder : consider the cyclic group ( mathbb Zn . ) Every subgroup is normal , and a maximal subgroup in a cyclic group is precisely one which has prime index . ( This is because the quotient , being abelian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nontrivial proper subgroups , which is only true if the quotient has prime order . ) So a composition series for ( mathbb Zn ) must have the form 1 triangleleft mathbb Zp1 triangleleft mathbb Zp1p2 triangleleft cdots triangleleft mathbb Zp1p2cdots pk = mathbb Zn , where the ( pi ) are primes . Since ( mathbb Zn ) has a composition series , ( n ) can be factored as a product of primes , and by Jordan " H+lder , a different factorization of ( n ) leads to a different composition series 1 triangleleft mathbb Zq1 triangleleft mathbb Zq1q2 triangleleft cdots triangleleft mathbb Zq1q2cdots qell = mathbb Zn , which must have the same composition factors up to permutation ( and ( k=ell ) ) . But the orders of the composition factors are just the primes ( pi ) ( and ( qj ) ) , so these lists are the same up to permutation , which is precisely the statement of the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic . <p> Normal subgroups of the symmetric group : For ( nge 5 , ) the alternating group ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ series ( 1 triangleleft An triangleleft Sn . ) Since the composition factor sizes are ( 2 ) and ( n ! /2 , ) this implies that the only other possible nontrivial normal subgroup of ( Sn ) has order ( 2 , ) which can easily be ruled out by a simple analysis of the nontrivial element of the subgroup . So for ( n ge 5 ) the only nontrivial proper normal subgroup of ( Sn ) is ( An . ) This is related to solvability of polynomial equations by radicals . <p> Algebraic geometry : A slight generalization of Jordan " H+lder ( to modules ) allows for an elegant and robust definition of the multiplicity of the intersection of two algebraic curves . This is used in Bezout 's theorem , which predicts the number of intersection points of two projective curves . The details of the definition are beyond the scope of this wiki , but the idea is that the intersection multiplicity is defined as the length of a certain module , which is defined to be the length of its composition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they all have the same number of terms , thanks to Jordan " H+lder . <h> Proof of the theorem <p> This proof is fairly technical . It will help to compare with the proof of the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic , and to understand the second isomorphism theorem . <p> As with the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic , the proof proceeds by induction , on ( G. ) The base case ( G=1 ) is trivial . Now suppose the theorem has been proven for all groups strictly smaller than ( G. ) <p> Take two composition series ( ( H1 , H2 , ldots , Hk ) ) and ( ( K1 , K2 , ldots , Kell ) ) for ( G. ) The theorem is true for ( H = Hk-1 ) and ( K = Kell-1 . ) If ( H=K ) then we are done , as the composition series must be rearrangements of each other . If ( H ne K , ) let ( L = H cap K. ) Then ( L ) has a composition series consisting of groups ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are two composition series for ( H , ) the one involving the ( Hi ) and the following one : 1 triangleleft L1 triangleleft L2 triangleleft cdots triangleleft Lt-1 triangleleft L triangleleft H. ( ( L=H cap K ) is a maximal subgroup of ( H ) because ( H/ ( Hcap K ) cong G/K , ) by the second isomorphism theorem . ) <p> By induction , this composition series must be a rearrangement of the other one : ( H1/H0 , H2/H1 , ldots , H/Hk-2 ) sim ( L1/L0 , L2/L1 , ldots , L/Lt-1 , H/L ) , where ( sim ) means " is the same up to permutation . " Note that the lengths being the same implies that ( t+1=k . ) <p> Similarly we get two composition series for ( K , ) using the same ( Li ) series for the second one . That is , ( K1/K0 , K2/K1 , ldots , K/Kell-2 ) sim ( L1/L0 , L2/L1 , ldots , L/Lt-1 , K/L ) . So ( t+1=ell . ) This proves that ( k=ell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first pair of lists , and append ( G/K ) to the second pair of lists . This gives ( H1/H0 , H2/H1 , ldots , H/Hk-2 , G/H ) sim ( L1/L0 , L2/L1 , ldots , L/Lt-1 , H/L , G/H ) ( L1/L0 , L2/L1 , ldots , L/Lt-1 , K/L , G/K ) sim ( K1/K0 , K2/K1 , ldots , K/Kell-2 , G/K ) . We want that the outer two lists are the same up to permutation . The inner two lists are the same except for the last two entries . But ( ( H/L , G/H ) ) and ( ( K/L , G/K ) ) are the same as ( ( G/K , G/H ) ) and ( ( G/H , G/K ) , ) again by the second isomorphism theorem . So the inner two lists are the same up to permutation ( a transposition of the last two factors ) , and the result follows .
