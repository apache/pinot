Throughout the early years of my marriage , I had the opportunity to learn the basics of Italian cuisine , and to perfect traditional family recipes .

During these years we traveled Italy extensively , savoring all the different regional cuisines , while developing a greater appreciation for the countrys culture , history and its people . <p> The essence of Italian cooking today is simplicity . One uses the freshest seasonal ingredients possible , and then uses basic cooking techniques to simply enhance the natural flavor of the food .

I will try and offer ideas for cutting steps whenever possible in my recipes for those who would prefer this help .

@@25143343 @5143343/ <h> Our Epic Adventure In Puglia Days Ten to Thirteen <p> This is the fourth and last installment of my four part journal sharing our amazing adventure in Puglia created for us by Southern Visions Travel . What started out as an simple cycling trip through Puglia , ended up as an epic adventure for both cyclists and non-riders like myself . The plan was to meet in Bari , ride around the tip of Puglia , breeze through Matera in Basilicata , ride through Abruzzo , Le Marche , and finally , end up at our home in Umbria . I want to thank Southern Visions Travel for the great app that they shared with us which included all of our trip information . That and the daily snapshots , ( a sheet of paper left in our rooms overnight that chronicled the next day 's activities ) made writing this post much easier ! <p> Day Ten Mattinata To The Tremiti Islands <p> Today was going to be our last full day in Puglia , and it was the cyclists second day off for the trip . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and simply hanging around the hotel , Antonello , our fearless leader , host , cycle van driver , and all-around cheerleader for the group , managed to talk everyone into taking part in the day 's activities . By the time the day was completed , I am sure that they were all glad that they did . For me , it was probably my favorite day of the entire trip . It was also Mother 's Day , and if I could n't spend the day with my family , I could n't imagine a more perfect day in Puglia . <p> The only tricky part of the day was that we all had to get up and out of the hotel very early to make the ferry in Vieste to take us to the Tremiti Islands for the day . It was a fast and furious ride from the hotel to Vieste but we made it intact , and just in time to board the ferry . The boat ride from Vieste to the islands is over two hours in duration , so those that were unhappy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gaetano was our guide for the day as he is very familiar with the islands and met us at the ferry that morning . After arriving in the port , Gaetano gave us a quick synopsis about the islands , and we then boarded our private boat to tour the various sea caves around the islands . <p> The Tremiti Islands are a group of small islands sitting off the coast of the Gargano peninsula that belong to Puglia . The islands were used for the internment of political prisoners during Benito Mussolinis Fascist regime , but are now an important tourist attraction , particularly during the summer season as they are famous for their crystal clear waters . Despite staying on the Gargano peninsula , I had never visited the Tremiti Islands before so was quite excited to spend the day there . <p> The boat we boarded to tour the islands was spacious with a great upper deck covered in lounging pillows . We headed out to explore the islands by water , and the day could n't have been more perfect . It was very warm , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sight . While coasting along the shore visiting the various sea caves and admiring the clear blue water , Antonello broke out the bubbly because we all had the day off and no one had to worry about getting back on the bike or into the car and driving to our next stop . We finally anchored the boat in a secluded sea cove for lunch , and the captain and his mate prepared a simple yet delicious meal for us . We started off with toasted bread and tomatoes drizzled with olive oil harvested on the islands . Apparently , cuttlefish were in season , as we then had pasta with cuttlefish and peas , and then cuttlefish stuffed and braised in tomato sauce . We even had a lemon cake to round off our meal baked by the captain 's wife because it was after all , Mother 's Day ! A couple of the more adventurous guys in our group went for a swim , but the water was still too cold for most of us . <p> It was a lovely , lazy day on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to the port to make the ferry back to Vieste . Because it is still early in the season , there were only a couple of ferries scheduled each day . We were told to bring a change of clothes for our next adventure that day , but it was kept a secret until we reached Vieste . We were eventually told that we were headed to a trabucco , in fact , one of the few working trabucchi left in Puglia . <p> A trabucco is a massive wooden construction built for fishing which consists of a platform anchored to the rock and juts out into the sea . Two or more long wooden arms stretch out above the sea and support a large net called a trabocchetto . The net is raised by manual labor requiring two or more fishermen to operate the winches raising the net . A smaller net is then lowered to scoop out the fish caught in the trabocchetto . Trabucci can be found along the coast of Abruzzo and Molise , and along the Gargano peninsula in Puglia . Most of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or are just not active , although there are still a few working trabucchi still found today . The trabucco dates back to the 18th century , and were created by fishermen of the Gargano peninsula so they could still fish even during inclement weather . My husband and I discovered trabucchi a number of years ago when driving down to Puglia along the coast of Abruzzo , and have always been fascinated by them . To spend time on one learning how they were used was a real treat for us ! <p> We arrived at the trabucco and were greeted by two musicians , a group of fishermen who were there to teach us how the trabucco operated , and a lavish aperitivo table covered in fresh seafood appetizers for us to nibble on while enjoying this unique experience . We watched the fisherman catch nets full of anchovies , and other small fish before some of our group joined in the fun to help operate the winches . We spent a relaxing couple of hours sipping bubbly and enjoying some more yet unusual tidbits prepared for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the sea .

To do so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marche . The riders started the day in the van before riding into the Gran Sasso di Monte della Laga National Park and eventually to our accommodations for the night . <p> The ladies or non-riders had a chance to repack and organize our belongings before heading up to Abruzzo . It was our longest drive of the trip , and it was soon apparent when the scenery changed to the mountains and rolling green pastures that we had left Puglia . We stopped for gas once we hit Abruzzo around lunch time , and I noticed a lot of trucks and cars parked at the adjacent bar with a sign outside advertising Tavola Calda . It was readily apparent that local workers were dining there which usually equates as good , cheap food ! Usually when you see the name Tavola Calda , which literally translates as a hot table ' , it is a place that sells mostly pre-made food that you get in line for , usually with a tray , cafeteria style . The place was packed with workers , and we all had a great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surprised the workers however as we turned down the additional bowl of pasta , the salads , and even dessert which of course would have all been included in the meal . We each had vegetables and some meat , and it turned out that the roast chicken was delicious ! <p> After lunch , we headed off to Santo Stefano di Sessanio just as the rain moved into the region . The tiny medieval village of Santo Stefano was all but abandoned with many of its ancient buildings in ruins and only 70 inhabitants until recently . Now , many of the villages buildings have been restored , including the hotel where we were staying that evening , the Sextantio Albergo Diffuso . The village had been damaged by the 2009 earthquake and was finally under restoration , so it was somewhat difficult to find . We finally realized that we needed to park in the lot at the top , and then made our way down to the main office . The hotel has restored rooms throughout the village , retaining many of their unique historical qualities . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the group , and it was divided over two levels and included an ancient working fireplace . <p> After settling into our rooms , we made our way down to the office to meet our local guide who took us to an antique working kitchen where the six of us ladies learned how to make traditional Abruzzi cookies . They even had gluten free flour for the one in our group who was on a gluten-free diet . We mixed the first cookie batter and used the hot press to create Ferratelle , flat , crisp cookies that I have always known as pizzelle . We were shown how to fill the cookies with jam or chocolate spread , and we enjoyed tasting our cookies with glasses of chilled Prosecco . Our second cookie we made was a simple ring cookie or Ciambelline Abruzzesi . These cookies we had fun shaping in different ways , and they were then cooked in the wood-burning oven just as they did in the old days . We all thoroughly enjoyed learning how to make traditional cookies of the region , and we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for dinner . <p> Dinner that night was at the hotel 's restaurant Locanda just down the narrow road from the hotel and serves very traditional Abruzzi cuisine . The dining rooms were kept int their original state and were furnished with antiques . Overall , it was a unique stay in Abruzzo , and I am sure that once the restoration has been completed , it will be a gorgeous place to stay less than a hundred miles from Rome . <p> We left Abruzzo for Le Marche this morning before reaching Umbria the following day . The non-riding ladies forgo the cheese making demonstration scheduled for later that morning as there was nothing to do in the small village we were staying at , and we thought Ascoli Piceno would have a lot more to do as it is a fairly large town . The riders left to tackle some major climbs , while those of us driving headed out towards Le Marche by road , none of us realizing that we would all come into contact with the Carabinieri , or Italian police , that day . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by trees on their scheduled route , and in trying to determine the best way to circumvent the obstruction , they climbed down a muddy hill with their bikes only to realize that they had come across the location where the hotel had been wiped out by an avalanche , killing many . It was still guarded by Carabinieri who chased the cyclists away telling them they could not be in that area and forbid them from taking photos . <p> The Carabinieri also stopped one of our cars coming through the toll booth on our way to Ascoli Piceno . There was a group of about eight policemen standing there while one demanded the registration , insurance papers and driver 's license . After a lot of going back and forth , the policeman stated that he was giving the driver a four hundred euro fine because she did not carry an international license or a translated license . He said she would have to follow him to the police station to pay the fine . Not only was the situation one I had never heard of in all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watching this transaction all seemed to think the whole situation was very funny . I called Antonello our host from Southern Visions Travel , and he spoke to the policeman explaining our situation and stating that the group would be leaving Italy in just two days . He also expressed that is would be a bad ending to our wonderful Italian experience . After going back and forth a couple of times with Antonello and then speaking to his partners , the Carabinieri finally let us go without paying a fine , though we were warned that that it was indeed the law in Italy for licenses from another country to be translated into Italian when driving in Italy . Lesson learned ! Lost cyclists , and non-riders being threatened that they would be dragged off to the police station . Poor Antonello had quite a morning getting us all sorted out ! <p> When we were finally on our way , we made it to Ascoli Piceno in good time , checked into our hotel Palazzo dei Mercanti , then headed out for a quick bite to eat at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , so we headed back to the hotel for a nap with plans to meet later that afternoon when the stores reopened at four . Ascoli Piceno is a beautiful town with lots of shops , quiet walking streets , and gorgeous historical buildings . After exploring the city on foot , we headed back to the hotel to clean up for dinner . <p> That evening we headed across the border in Abruzzo to Emidio Pepe winery . Emidio Pepe is a unique example of a man who developed his vineyard management and winemaking philosophy alone , starting in 1964 with one single hectare near the village of Torano Nuovo . The estate which covers over 15 hectares is considered one the best cantinas of the region . Emidio Pepes father and grandfather had been winegrowers as well , but Emidio Pepe was the first in his family to bottle and label his own wine . We arrived at the family compound and were greeted by Chiara , Emidio 's granddaughter , along with her Mother . It was quickly apparent that the entire family was involved in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passionate about their label . The ladies arrived at the compound first , and we were treated to the cantina 's famous white wine , made with Pecorino grapes . We were surprised to learn that it was a white wine created to be aged , even as long as ten years . Once the rest of the party arrived , Chiara took us on a tour of the winery , and we were amazed to learn that they still pressed their grapes by foot , though they were not barefoot and instead wore rubber boots . Chiara 's exuberance and passion for her familys wine were contagious , and after the tour , we headed over to their terrace where an elegant table was set up for us overlooking the fields of grapes . We were served course after course of traditional dishes prepared by the family with ingredients either grown on the property or produced locally . We even had the privilege of having Emidio Pepe himself sitting at the table for dinner with us . He made a striking figure in his hat and suit , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like an Italian movie star or a politician . Once the sun went down and the wind picked up , it became quite cool on the terrace , and the family kindly offered all the ladies shawls to keep warm . Dessert was enjoyed inside before we made our thanks to the family for a truly unforgettable evening , and made our way back to our hotel in Ascoli Piceno . <p> After twelve days on the road ( thirteen for my husband and I ) it was time to head home that day . There were just three cyclists that wanted to complete the last day of riding , so we divided the rest up into two cars after carefully rearranging luggage . Before leaving Ascoli Piceno , we had a walking tour of the town , and although it was very informative , we were all anxious to get on the road . We drove along the coast towards Umbria , and when stopping for lunch were surprised to find the other car stopping at the same service station . We made it to Umbria promptly before dropping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afternoon , we all got together at our home in Umbria and toasted a very successful trip . We all thanked Antonello , and his team at Southern Visions Travel for their dedication to detail and for creating this once in a lifetime trip for us . <p> Antonello had to leave with the van and drive back to Puglia that night , while the rest of us headed up the hill from our house to our local favorite trattoria Al Leone in Collazzone for a celebratory dinner . This time there was no seafood , it was instead all dishes typical of Umbrian cuisine . At the end of the evening , we all said our goodbyes to those heading back to North America the next morning , while the rest of us came back to our place . <p> I have been to Puglia many times in the past and thought I knew Puglia fairly well before this trip . I experienced so much on this adventure in Puglia with Southern Visions Travel that I never would of on my own , and each days activities made me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Southern Visions Travel for creating the trip that the cyclists asked for , while still creating a memorable trip for us non-riders .

@@25143347 @5143347/ <h> How To Make Focaccia Step By Step <p> Focaccia is one of the most popular and most ancient of the breads of Italy and is very easy to make . I have created this step by step primer to show everyone just how simple it is to make really great focaccia , and what a versatile bread it truly is . Basic focaccia dough requires only five ingredients , flour , water , olive oil , salt , and yeast . A simple focaccia dough lends itself to so many variations that once you master the dough , your options are endless . You can flavor the focaccia dough itself , add a myriad of different seasonal toppings both sweet and savory , create a crisp crusted focaccia that is great for dipping or spreading with creamy toppings , or make a thicker crusted focaccia that is perfect to use for sandwiches or panini . This easy flat bread is also a great option for novice bread bakers as it can be prepared easily and does not require any fancy shaping . <p> I have been making focaccia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presently probably make it at least twice a week in one form or another . I have learned over the years what ingredients work best for my focaccia dough - but you may prefer to make some changes . For my flour , I use plain old All-purpose flour , or tipo 0 flour here in Italy . Many recipes call for tipo 00 flour which is much softer flour , but I find the focaccia made with this flour gets a little tough after it has sat for any length of time . I feel the focaccia made with all-purpose flour holds up better , and makes better sandwiches as well . I use only instant active dry yeast , and prefer the Saf-instant brand . This yeast never let 's me down , and I can add it dry to my other ingredients as it does not require proofing first . I add fine sea salt for flavor , and I always add a little extra virgin olive oil for both flavor and texture . I use basic tap water that feels warm to the touch which helps promote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as it may kill your yeast . Of course , no matter what other topping ingredients I plan to use , I always add extra virgin olive oil and coarse sea salt before I bake my focaccia as well . <p> The trick to making great focaccia is to ensure you create lots of dimples with your finger tips into your dough and then drizzle enough olive oil into those dimples which will then get absorbed while the focaccia bakes creating a flavorful bread with a crisp crust and tender interior . To make a thicker dough , let the dough rise three times as shown below . If you prefer a thin , crisp crust , let the dough rise just twice and bake immediately after you drizzle on your olive oil . The recipe below is for a plain , basic olive oil and salt focaccia . <p> Continue to add water until the dough begins to come together into a shaggy ball . <p> Dump the dough mixture onto a lightly floured surface surface and begin to knead with the heels of your hand . <p> Knead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smooth and pliant . <p> Add a little oil ( 2 tablespoons ) to the bottom of a large bowl and place your ball of dough inside . Roll the ball around in the oil , ensuring the sides of the bowl , and ball of dough are both lightly oiled . <p> Cover your bowl with plastic wrap and place in a warm spot to rise . I cover mine with a kitchen towel on top of the plastic wrap and sit it on a large sunny windowsill . Let the dough rise until it is doubled in size , about an hour or an hour and a half depending on ambient temperature . <p> You can see how pillowy and soft the dough becomes . <p> To make a large rectangular focaccia , lightly oil a 13 X 9 inch baking sheet with sides . <p> Dump your risen dough into the pan punching it down to deflate it . <p> Use your fingers to push and press the dough evenly over the bottom of the pan. - Cover with a kitchen towel and let rise for another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pushed with your fingertip . <p> Use the tips of your fingers to dimple the entire top of the focaccia . Drizzle olive oil over the top turning the pan carefully to allow the oil to roll into the indentations . <p> Sprinkle coarse sea salt over the top of your focaccia and then let it sit and rise for another 15 minutes while you preheat your oven to 425 degrees F. <p> Bake for 20 to 25 minutes until golden brown . Cool to room temperature before slicing . <p> To make round loaves , divide your ball of dough after the first rise into three equal parts . I actually weigh mine and these balls weighed 400g ( About 14 ounces ) each . <p> Sprinkle cornmeal over three baking sheets . Take one ball art a time and use your hands to begin to press into a flat disc . <p> Use the heel of your hand pushing from the center out , turning the circle of dough as you go until you create a circle about 12 inches across . Place each round on a prepared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for 20 to 30 minutes until soft . <p> Dimple the dough with fingers as shown with the rectangular focaccia above , drizzle with olive oil , sprinkle with sea salt , and add any additional toppings you prefer . Above I used halved , pitted Kalamata olives . Let prepared dough- sit and rise for another 15 minutes while you preheat your oven to 425 degrees F. - Bake for about 20 minutes until golden brown . Cool to room temperature before slicing . <h> Did you like this post ?

For every day bread and baked goods , I use an unbleached all-purpose flour . King Arthur is my favorite .

@@25143349 @5143349/ <h> How To Make Orecchiette Step By Step <p> Orecchiette pasta resemble little ears , which is where they get their name . This unique pasta shape can be found across Italy , but is traditionally a typical pasta of Puglia . Although there are many variations of ingredients used to make this pasta , traditionally it is made simply with a combination of fine semolina flour and water although I found I prefer to add a little regular flour into the mix as well . Having just returned from a week in Puglia I was very interested in tackling this pasta myself once I returned home after having watched old Nonnas pulling a knife across the little pasta discs and making orecchiette by the hundreds in mere minutes . Unfortunately , I found it took me a little experimentation to get the dough stiff enough to hold its shape when pulled , and the technique itself takes a little practice in order to form the orecchiette evenly but once you 've got it you can work very quickly . <p> I tried using a knife as I saw many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to simply use my thumb to pull the dough into an ear shape . Do n't  worry if your orecchiette are n't  perfectly shaped as the irregular shape adds to its rustic charm . I 've made this pasta myself three times now and have found it gets easier each time . Ideally , you want the orecchiette to be of even size so they are all perfectly cooked at the same time , but as long as they are close I would n't worry too much about it . <p> A perfect orecchiette is about 3/4 of an inch across and slightly domed shaped which enables them to hold pasta sauce well . The method used to make them creates centers that are thinner than their rims , a characteristic that gives them an interestingly texture , soft in the middle and somewhat more chewy outside when cooked " al dente " . <p> Ingredients <p> 2 Parts Semolina ( I Used 1/2 Pound ) <p> 1 Part All-purpose Flour ( I Used 1/4 Pound ) <p> Warm Water <p> Simply mix the two flours together and then begin to add @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Once you obtain a workable dough , knead on a lightly floured surface for 10 to 15 minutes until the dough is very smooth and stiff .

Using a well floured textured surface , roll the ball into a tube about 1/2 to 3/4 of an inch thick . <p> Use a sharp knife , cut the tube into 1/4 inch discs , keeping the dough well floured as you cut . <p> Use your fingers to lightly push @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One method of shaping the orecchiette is to place the side of a knife at the top of one of the discs and to gently and quickly pull the knife across the disc of dough letting it wrap up over the knife creating an ear shape .

This works best if the dough is quite stiff , and both the knife and dough are well floured to prevent sticking . <p> The method I prefer for shaping the " ears " is to place my floured thumb at the top of the disc and using a little pressure pull it across the disc creating the ear shape .

The noodles came out alright , but kind of tough ( almost leathery ) and kind of heavy . I tried another batch with less water in the dough , but it was even tougher . Do you know what I could be doing that would make the dough tough or leathery ? Learning to make pasta without a teacher right next you is tricky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this with the sauce you posted for gnocchi bolognese and added some eggplant , and it was divine . <p> The dough is fairly stiff to work with because you are using semolina flour , but it should cook up just fine . If you prefer a softer dough , replace some of the semolina with all-purpose flour . Glad you enjoyed the Bolognese sauce ! <p> I made them yesterday and left them out on tray overnight to dry but did not cover them , then this morning I put them in a freezer bag until I 'm ready to cook them . Was it ok not to cover them overnight ? why do they say cover with a cloth ?

My husband planted Friggitelli peppers in our garden this years , and these three pepper plants have been very prolific . I have fried the peppers , used them in pasta dishes , cooked them in tomato sauce , but my husband 's favorite way to prepare them has to be this fried potato and pepper dish . To be honest , you do not even need to measure the ingredients . I use almost equal amounts of boiled potatoes and peppers , throw chopped onion and garlic and some chopped pancetta for flavor and fry them up together in a large pan and just let the magic happen .

What started out as a basic cycling trip through Puglia , ended up as an epic adventure for both cyclists and non-riders like myself . The plan was to meet in Bari , ride around the tip of Puglia , breeze through Matera in Basilicata , ride through Abruzzo , Le Marche , and finally , end up at our home in Umbria . I want to thank Southern Visions Travel for the great app that they shared with us which included all of our trip information . That and the daily snapshots , ( a sheet of paper left in our rooms overnight that chronicled the next day 's activities ) made writing this post much easier ! <p> Day Seven Toriccella to Grottaglie to Taranto to Matera <p> We woke up to another rainy day in Masserie Le Fabriche , and the riders had to make a decision on how best to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Matera . In the end , the decision was made to use the SAG van to maneuver around the city as Taranto can be a little rough in parts . <p> The ladies were excited upon awakening on this cool , rainy day , because not only were we headed to Grottaglie , the ceramic center of Puglia ( SHOPPING ! ! ! ) , we also had Giuseppe as our guide for the day . Giuseppe met us and asked if we would trust him to take us to another spot not on our itinerary , as he wanted to show us the Castello Imperiali in his hometown of Francavilla Fontana , which was on our way to Grottaglie . The castle was purchased by the Imperiali in the 17th century from the Orsini family . The castle has been completely restored and sits right in the center of town . Giuseppe took us on a private tour of the Castello , and shared with us his personal experience of studying there as a student . We then had a quick stop at a local bar for a quick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mother and niece . We were also gifted with a large bottle of homemade Prosecco , and another of sweet wine , but we turned down the offer of tasting either as we had a lot of traveling yet to do that day ! <p> After Francavilla , we headed to the city of Grottaglie which sits on a small hill a few kilometers from Taranto . It is famous for both its wines and its ceramics , and surrounding the historic center , along winding streets is the pottery district . Giuseppe took us into a well-known shop where we watched the owners throwing clay and painting ceramics . It was a tiny shop packed with their finished wares , and we were shown the traditional designs that have made Grottaglie famous worldwide . <p> After our tour of the factory , the owner of the shop took us to visit his home . None of us were too excited at the prospect as we did not know what to expect . I honestly envisioned sitting at a plastic covered table while Nonna fed us homemade cookies and wine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of us ladies will always remember . We were shown a personal exhibit of history leading back thousands of years , discovered when the home was restored , and the basement was excavated . The owner told us the story of how all these priceless works of art were uncovered , and it was evident by the great care he took to exhibit all of them what a passionate and proud caretaker he truly is . It amazed all of us that these museum quality pieces were sitting in a private home , but it was explained to us that the state had originally confiscated many pieces but then returned them as they simply do not have any space left in museums to show them ! After our very memorable tour of this beautiful home museum , it was time to shop for ceramics . Being very familiar with Italian ceramics myself , including the traditional pieces of Puglia , I searched for and found a pair of Pupe figurines , along with a Puma for the new house we are building . The Puma is egg-shaped , and is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fertility , and can be found displayed in most homes in Puglia . <p> After finally rounding us all up after each of us completed our shopping , ( Giuseppe truly has the patience of Job ! ) we headed on to Taranto by car to have lunch in one of Giuseppe 's favorite restaurants , Al Canale . We thoroughly enjoyed yet another fantastic seafood meal along with a lot of laughs with Giuseppe . The plan after lunch was to head to the Taranto Archaeological Museum , but after yet another big meal , some of us needed to walk . Giuseppe headed off to the museum with some of our group , while the rest of us walked and we met back at Il Canale a couple of hours later . Before heading off to Matera , our stop for the night , Giuseppe serenaded us with a Pugliese folk song while playing the tambourine . We all thanked him for a wonderful day we will all remember fondly , climbed back into our cars yet again , and headed off to Matera . <p> Matera is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaving Puglia for just one night . Matera is unlike any place I have ever visited , and even after many trips there , it still amazes me . Matera is famous for its sassi , or complex of houses , churches , and shops built into the natural caves of the Murgia . Because of its historic appearance , over twenty-six movies have been filmed over the years in Matera , including Mel Gibson 's The Passion of Christ . Matera was named a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1993 and is well worth reading about . I honestly could write a book about Matera , but since this is a blog post about our Puglia adventure , I 'll keep the information about Matera brief . <p> Our hotel for the night was Palazzo Gattini , located in Piazza Duomo . After getting over my nerves about driving right through Piazza Duomo to our hotel , we discovered it without any problems , and in fact , it turned out to be one of our easier travel destination discoveries of the trip . Best of all , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and two bottles of water waiting in our room for our little dog Zoe who has been traveling with us ! The hotel was lovely , the rooms unique and elegant , and the location just perfect to visit the historic sassi , or to shop in the newer town . <p> Later that day , Antonio , a Matera local guide , met the entire group for a walking tour of Matera and then we all met at an ancient sassi church turned into a restaurant for a very private special candlelit meal . Although the meal itself was not one of my favorites , the experience and ambience were unrivaled ! <p> Today after breakfast in the hotel , the riders left a little later with a ride through the Alta Murgia National Park before heading alongside Castle del Monte and then to that night 's hotel . <p> The ladies were on their own to locate Altamura in order to visit a very traditional bakery where they make the famous Pane DOP di Altamura . After having a little trouble getting our cars brought to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Altamura only to find the city packed that day as it was market day . After trying to locate the bakery by car which was impossible , we finally found parking on a larger street and then headed out to find the bakery . We met a lovely older couple while walking with our map who once they knew what we were looking for took us directly to the door of the bakery . There was some confusion because we were a little late and the guide that was to meet us had another appointment so had to leave the bakery before we even arrived . The nephew of the original owners who runs the bakery today spoke enough English however , to give us a good explanation on how this bread became a DOP product , and what restrictions they must follow to be able to label their bread DOP . Each loaf of bread has a DOP label attached to it before to is baked in a huge wood-burning oven along with dozens of other loaves . After sampling some of their products and getting directions to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ site seeing in Altamura . <p> Having never visited Altamura before , I found it a lovely town to visit . The historical center has closed off traffic to cars , and so you can walk along and shop without worry . After shopping for an hour or two , we set off to find somewhere in the historical center for lunch . We came across a small place just off the main shopping street , and while we were deciding if we should try it , an old man walked by and told us that the food was excellent there . After entering , we saw that the small trattoria had only locals dining there who all seemed to be enjoying the daily menu . Although our food took a little longer than we would have liked to arrive , it was a great local place to eat ; the food was excellent and very inexpensive . Always trust the locals when looking for a good , low cost meal ! <p> After returning to our cars , we were off to Castle del Monte , a 13th-century citadel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Apulia region of southeast Italy . It was built during the 1240s by the Emperor Frederick II , who had inherited the lands from his mother Constance of Sicily . It is truly a fantastic site sitting up on a hill with nothing but farmland around it . We arrived early , and after hanging around for a while , we were greeted by a Southern Visions employee who told us that our guide would be late . We were warm and tired , and anxious to get to our hotel for the night , so after waiting for a while , we set off to discover the castle on our own . Our guide caught up with us , and after telling him that we were tired and only wanted a quick tour , he gave us a synopsis of the history while we walked through the castle . We then headed off to Agriturismo Lama Di Luna , our stop for the night , a few kilometers away . Lama di Luna was probably our most rustic accommodation of the trip although the rooms were spotless , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ owners had some dogs on the grounds that were fascinated by my five pound Yorkie Zoe , and they all followed us around whenever we took her outside our room . The Pomeranian , a male , was particularly infatuated with her if you know what I mean , while one of the Irish Setters kept breaking into our room by opening the door herself in order to come in and find Zoe . It was NOT Zoe 's favorite accommodation as she was nervous our entire stay ! <p> Later that evening we headed to the fantastic Antichi Sapori Trattoria for an amazing Pugliese meal prepared by Pietro Zito . This restaurant is in the tiny town of Montegrosso , and it is only because of the breathtaking field to table dishes that the place is packed full every night . There is no menu as the chef creates a daily menu around what ingredients he finds fresh and seasonal each day .

Once in Trani we met Anna , our guide for the morning who took us around the historical part of Trani giving us all a quick overview of this beautiful city . At around noon , we lined up in the streets preparing for the Giro riders to pass through along with hundreds of locals . My husband and I try to see the Giro every year at least one of their stages , so it was very fortunate that we were able to join in the excitement in Puglia this year .

Before you can even get your camera focused , it seems they have already passed by ! <p> While waiting for the streets to clear , the non-riders headed down to the harbor for a waterside lunch at a local pizzeria , and after lunch , we headed down to Puglia 's largest shopping center in Monopoli to waste away a couple of hours taking part in some retail therapy . The cyclists took off to ride the same roads that the Giro cyclists took earlier , stopping off for a picnic lunch along the way . <p> This night 's stay was at Hotel Il Residence Il Porto in Mattinata along the Gargano peninsula . It is a large hotel with apartments above it , and those lucky enough to stay in those rooms had their own washing machines . After nine days on the road , we were all happy to be able to wash some clothes ! Dinner that evening was at Il Porto where we enjoyed a light seafood meal .

Gnocchi are basically dumplings , and can be made of almost any ingredients that can be formed into a dough . Gnocchi , ( pronounced NYOK-ee ) are made in most regions in Italy , although they are generally made with different ingredients in each . For example , on the island of Sardinia , you can find tiny saffron flavored potato gnocchi , while in the Alto Adige in the mountains up near Austria ; they are often made with breadcrumbs . <p> In other regions you can find gnocchi made with everything from semolina , spinach , ricotta , chestnut flour , squash , buckwheat flour or the most common , the potato .

The less flour you use the lighter the gnocchi you can achieve . <p> Knead your gnocchi dough only as long as it takes for the ingredients to come together into a workable dough . The longer you knead , the more flour you will use , resulting in a heavier gnocchi . Remember , a light hand yields light , delicate gnocchi ! <p> It is a good idea if you are new to gnocchi making to test your gnocchi before you prepare the whole batch .

I would not keep any type of gnocchi in the refrigerator longer than a few hours .

The less you knead the gnocchi , and the less flour you use will help to create a light textured gnocchi .

@@25143367 @5143367/ <h> Italian Culinary Adventure Day Four &amp; Five - Florence <p> Ponte Vecchio <p> Florence- Day FourTuesday , June 25th. 2002 <p> After a night of violent thunderstorms , we rose early to leave Venice for the next destination of our trip which was Florence . After a quick breakfast , we took the waterbus back to the parking garage and were on our way . Upon arriving in Florence a few hours later , we had a little trouble finding our hotel as many streets are closed to traffic in the city . After a few tries though , we finally arrived at Hotel Due Fontane , in Piazza S.S. Annunziata . We noticed immediately , that the city seemed very noisy in contrast to the solitude of Venice , as motorcycle after motorcycle raced up and down the small streets outside our hotel . Since so many streets in the city center are now closed to traffic , I suppose motorcycles , and motorinos are becoming much more popular . We certainly noticed a great many folks using bicycles to get around the city . Venice that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the heat in Florence was intense . The hotel appeared fine , perhaps just a little run down and in need of refurbishing , but our room was very clean , and for 180 Euros and just steps from the cathedral , it was just fine . Click on photo for larger view ! <p> We quickly dropped off our luggage , and rushed off to see if we could make reservations at the restaurant Il Cibreo for later that night . When we walked into the restaurant , Fabio the owner/chef was behind the counter , and gave us a seating at 9:30pm that night . We noticed that they now have a new trattoria attached to the restaurant , where they used to just have a few seats in a small room behind the restaurant . Il Cibreo is one Italian restaurant that does not serve pasta . Apparently since pasta is not really a staple in the Tuscan diet as it is in other areas of Italy , the owner instead chooses to offer traditional Tuscan dishes with a contemporary flair . We went across the street @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Il Pizzaiuolo serves very good Neapolitan style pizza , which is n't always that easy to find outside of Naples . Although I found the crust a little thick for my liking , my pizza was tender and crisp . We finished off two bottles of water , and then left the restaurant to explore the city . <p> Heading into the main shopping area around the cathedral , we were struck first of all by the huge number of tourists around , many in organized tour groups all trying to walk together in a large throng . Although Venice had its share of tourists , somehow , you never felt crowded as crowded as we did in Florence . Very quickly , I found myself disappointed with Florence , as it just did n't seem to have the charm for me that it used to . In fact , it seemed dirtier , more crowded , and noisier than I ever remembered on past trips . I was all too aware at that point why I never traveled to Florence in the summer as a general rule ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we went into a few leather goods stores , Tuscan food stores , and ceramic stores , but did n't buy anything . We tried to stay out of the path of the large tour groups milling around , and did some shopping and took a few photos of the city . By late afternoon , we had certainly had enough of playing tourists , and headed back to our hotel to cool off , shower and change . Click on photo for larger view ! <p> When we left the hotel a few hours later , it seemed to have cooled off a bit , and we wandered around the area between the hotel and Il Cibreo looking for a bar for a pre-dinner cocktail . We ended up in the small piazza beside the restaurant , and enjoyed a glass of crisp , dry prosecco wine among the locals at an outdoor bar . At about 9:15pm , we headed into Il Cibreo , and after a short wait we were seated at a large round table with two other couples . Although at first I was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found both couples very friendly and we found we enjoyed the company . One couple was from England , and the other from the US on their honeymoon . In Italy , you are often seated at tables with other people , but not usually at round tables where it is difficult not to talk to those across from you . <p> The meal which we had been looking forward to since we even planned this trip began with a selection of tiny appetizers brought by the kitchen which included a small bruschetta with Tuscan liver spread , another with half a cherry tomato that was roasted until sweet , some tomato aspic that was fresh and cool , a cracker with Robiola cheese and a small piece of mostarda fruit , and a rounded mound of couscous salad made with fresh mint , tomatoes and cucumbers . These delicious appetizers were just tiny offerings , to help prepare the taste buds for the upcoming meal . For my first course , I ordered the Sformata di Ricotta and Patate which I had had on a previous trip , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is a tender , pudding like dish served with a seasonal topping . The last time I had it they had served it with a small scoop of meaty ragu on top . This time it was presented with a dollop of vibrant pesto , roasted pine nuts , and grated Parmesan cheese . My husband had the server choose his meal , and was brought two soups to start , including Il Cibreo 's famous Roasted Pepper soup , and a flavorful pureed porcini soup . Because of the hot day , both were served at room temperature , which even intensified their flavors . Click on photo for larger view ! <p> I decided to order the tuna for my second course which sounded fresh and light when it was described to us . It was a nice presentation of thinly sliced almost raw tuna , served with a lemon , olive oil dressing , and a mound of finely chopped cucumbers and green onions . The overall flavor was wonderful , and the tuna melted in your mouth . My husband was brought pigeon , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relish , and a small side dish of green beans cooked in tomato sauce and garlic . Although I personally find the taste of pigeon too strong , my husband enjoyed his meal , and thought the side dishes went perfectly with the pigeon . <p> Although our table mates all ordered desserts that looked wonderful , we chose instead to order a selection of Tuscan cheese which we enjoyed with the rest of our wine . The cheese was indeed a perfect match for our Antinori Chianti Classico Reserve , 1999 wine . Having enjoyed both our evening and our meal completely , we returned to our hotel to rest up for the next day .

At home , I make both ricotta and potato gnocchi pretty often .

@@25143383 @5143383/ <h> How To Make Garden Fresh Tomato Sauce Step by Step <p> Every year when late summer rolls around and we enter into " tomato season " I begin to crave this simple , flavorsome tomato sauce . There is no other tomato sauce so pure of flavor as one made from garden fresh ripe tomatoes that are heated just long enough to thicken into a sauce . I first enjoyed this sauce at my Mother-In-Laws table 40 years ago , and from that first tast it has remained one of my very favorite tomato sauces . Lina would pick very ripe plum tomatoes gently warmed from the summer sun from her garden in the morning , then quickly turn the tomatoes into the purest flavored sauce possible . This quick sauce was most often used to lightly dress the delicate egg pasta that Lina made by hand , and she would serve this wonderful combination to her family as we all gathered at her table each Sunday . <p> This sauce is so vibrant tasting and light as it requires just a short cooking time to reduce the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go a long way , so do n't  be tempted into dumping spoonfuls of this sauce on your bowl of pasta but instead , lightly dress your pasta to truly enjoy the fresh , natural tomato essence . This very simple sauce uses garden fresh ripe tomatoes , not canned , so is best made only when garden fresh , locally grown tomatoes are available which is usually late summer and early fall . I am often told that some folks are a little intimidated to make a sauce from scratch using tomatoes , but as you can see by my photos , it is extremely easy and after you have made it once , you will want to make it again and again . <p> Like most basic Italian recipes , to create an amazing final dish you must use the freshest , top quality ingredients you can . I prefer plum tomatoes , San Marzano if possible , which are readily available here in Italy . When I am North America I choose locally grown plum tomatoes , but any " paste " tomato can be turned into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are fresh basil , a good quality extra virgin olive oil , garlic , and finely diced sweet onion . You may come across recipes that include celery and carrots , or even some that include a pinch of sugar , but in my opinion sugar is never needed if you choose the right variety of tomatoes , and if they are nice and ripe . Save the carrots and celery for long cooking sauces as they will only muck up the pure tomato flavor of this sauce . <p> You really want the tomatoes for this sauce to be as ripe as possible , so I usually place my tomatoes in a bowl and leave them in my window to fully ripen for a couple of days before I use them . I like my fresh tomato sauce a little chunky , so I cut my prepared tomatoes into strips , but feel free to pass through a food mill if you prefer a more blended sauce . I also like to cut out the little core at the stem end , and gently squeeze or scoop out most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fresh sauce . This too is a personal preference , and if you do not mind the seeds , simply skip this step . <p> In my opinion , this sauce will work on just about any type of pasta , but I personally use it on egg pasta such as fettuccine or tagliatelle , or a strabded dried pasta such as spaghetti . In my photos , I used Barilla whole wheat spaghetti which is one of my favorite whole grain pastas . This brand of whole wheat pasta cooks up well , and is very similar to regular pasta once cooked . The advantage of using Barilla whole wheat pasta is that for every 100 grams , you get 12 grams of protein and 6 grams of fiber ! I always measure my pasta before cooking and allow 100 grams of dried pasta per person which is more than enough for a single portion . If you cook too much pasta , you may not have enough sauce to properly dress it for serving . When I serve pasta with this simple sauce , I like to garnish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pine nuts , and I always offer grated Pecorino Romano cheese at the table . <p> Begin with about 2 1/2 pounds very ripe plum tomatoes . <p> Cut an X into the stem end of each tomato and then drop into a pot of boiling water for about 2 to 3 minutes or until you see the skins begin to loosen . Use a slotted spoon to place the tomatoes into a colander in the sink and run cold water over them until they are cool enough to handle . <p> Use a sharp knife to slip the skins off the tomatoes , then cut in half . Cut out the small core at the stem end , and then gently scoop the seeds out with your fingers . Cut the tomatoes into strips or a coarse dice . <p> Prepare the onions , garlic , olive oil , salt pepper and basil .

What would be the difference with the cooking times ? Also , does the final product come out saucy or thick and chunky ? My kids like more of a saucy sauce . <p> Steve , I wanted a fresh tomato taste so I do not cook this sauce long . If your tomatoes are ripe you do not need to cook it for hours and your sauce will taste garden fresh . Yes , the sauce is a bit chunky which is how I like it , but you can certainly create a smoother sauce by blending it with a blender if you prefer .

We generally tend to stick to the markets close to our farmhouse , although we do often venture a little farther over to Perugia on Saturdays for the market there . <p> If you enjoy cooking , or even eating for that matter , it is impossible not to get inspired as you walk through an outdoor market here in Umbria .

@@25143397 @5143397/ <h> My Siena Palio Experience Part Two <p> We returned to Siena the day before the Palio , excited to take part in the upcoming activities after spending one day with Dario Castagno earlier in the week learning some of the history of the race and getting a better understanding of life within a contrada . At Darios advice , we booked a two nights stay at Dievole , a lovely Chianti wine estate not far from Siena . We met up with Dario at Dievole where he took us on a tour of the estate that included a wine tasting and I think I learned more about Chianti wines on that one hour long tour than have in all the years we 've lived in Italy . We ended our tour with a traditional Tuscan lunch in a private dining room on the estate before we prepared to return to Siena for that evenings festivities . <p> While we were back home in Umbria we had been checking online to see which jockeys had been chosen by each contrada and to read the Palio updates and predictions regarding the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over which contrada veteran jockey Gigi Bruschelli would ride for as he had just claimed his twelth victory riding for the Tartuca in July and needed one more win to tie as the winningest jockey in Siena history . Gigi in fact chose to ride for the contrada of the wave on Magic Tiglio , one of the horses favored to win . Sadly however , Gigi was thrown from his horse and never finished the race . <p> Once the horses are assigned and the jockeys chosen , they take part in six trial races , or runs , before the actual Palio , with the last one taking place the morning of the true race . These races are really not taken too seriously , and are more for the jockeys to get to know the horse , and for the horses to feel comfortable on the track . The fifth trial , the one run the evening prior to the official Palio , is called the prova generale or general trial while the last which takes place the morning of the race , is called provaccia- or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into it in order to avoid tiring the horses too much before the real race . After the fifth trial or prova generale , all the contrade that are taking place in the Palio the following day host a dinner to celebrate . <p> We headed into Siena to watch this fifth trial and stood in the packed streets outside the Campo with hundreds cheering on the ten contrade as they arrived with their horses to take part in the trial . It is a very colorful and passionate procession and after all the horses have been brought into the Campo , the center fills up quickly to watch the trial . The prova generale is preceded by the traditional carica dei carabinieri on horseback where a group of highly trained carabinieri race around the Campo on horseback with swords drawn . Unfortunately , one poor fellow fell off his horse though he managed to escape injury . I found it quite claustrophobic packed into that small space with so many people , but the trial was over quickly and everyone headed out to the celebration dinners throughout the city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they were not hosting a dinner that evening , so Dario got us tickets to attend the dinner of the porcupines , one of the caterpillars allies . This party is a very loud , boisterous affair with much singing and drinking of wine . At the celebration dinner , the contradaioli , ( Captain of the contrada ) , the jockey , contrada members , and even tourists if they are very lucky , all party together and have a great time and though we headed back to our hotel by midnight , we are told this party can last to the wee hours of the night . After the dinner , the captain of the contrada goes meet the captains of the allied contrade to form alliances against the enemy contrade although all the agreements are verbal . These alliances are taken very seriously , because in Siena , as much as you want your contrada to win , at all costs , you do NOT want your enemy to win . See the list of the Siena Contrade &amp; Their Alliances &amp; Enemies from Part One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chapel next to the Town Hall , the Archbishop of Siena celebrates the Messa del Fantino , or the mass for the jockeys , which is followed by the sixth trial , or provaccia . After the provaccia , the jockeys and the captains go to the town hall to register the jockey and the jacket with which he will ride . At some point before the Palio , each contrade will take their horse and jockey into their chapel to be blessed , with the priest stating vai e torna vincitore ! ( Go and return a winner ! ) After the blessing ceremony , the contrade 's comparse , or group of costumed men who represent their contrada , walk through the city center stopping in Piazza Salimbeni in front of the Casino dei Nobili , in front of Palazzo Chigi Saraceni , and in front of the Duomo to perform their flag-waving show much to the delight of the crowded throngs of tourists . <p> The city of Siena was buzzing the day of the Palio and you could truly feel the excitement in the air . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the parade , or Corteo Storico begins exactly at 5pm . Although I was told ahead of time that some folks arrive many hours ahead to get good viewing spots in the center of the Campo , it really did not begin to fill until about 4pm . We were very lucky that our seats were in the shade , as the day was a warm one , but at exactly 5pm the parade began and lasted for about an hour and a half . The parade has always occurred before the Palio since the race originated and it is a formally choreographed march that commemorates the ancient institutions , customs and greatness of the Republic of Siena . It is taken very seriously , and in fact a prize is awarded to the contrada who performs most elegantly , called a Masgalano . The flag-bearers of each contrada stop at the various points in the Piazza and in time with the drum roll perform a spectacular flag-waving exhibition ending with the throwing of the flag at the end . Having Dario sit beside us was priceless as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the more meaningful . <p> Shortly after the parade , the explosion of a firecracker signals the entrance of the horses into the piazza . As the jockeys come out , each one receives a whip made out of ox sinew which they can use to prod their horse . The race starts off in the Mossa , an area set up on the piazza marked off by two long pieces of thick rope . The Mossiere then calls the horses and jockeys in the order in which they were drawn and checks that the assigned positions are taken . While we were watching and waiting for the Palio to begin , we saw many of the jockeys walk out to speak with the tenth position jockey attempting to negotiate with him when to start the race . Once the first nine jockeys are all lined up in their assigned spaces , the tenth jockey decides when the race is to start by galloping into place . If the start is not considered clean , a shot goes out to signal the jockeys to get back into place . Rivalries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The worst result is to see your enemy win the race ! The wait for the start of the race can be extremely long and last past dusk , causing the race to be postponed until the next day because they just could n't get a clean start . <p> We luckily watched the race get off to a clean start fairly quickly , and the crowd was going crazy jumping up and down and shouting around us . Unfortunately , there was a monumental crash of horses and riders at the first turn which is always a very precarious point in the race , and six of the ten jockeys were thrown off their horses . The other four horses with jockeys raced on , and even the fallen horses all got up and bravely tried to continue the race . Before the first horse even crossed the finish line the members of the contrada of the ram ( Val di Montone ) were jumping from the stands in excitement and emotion . This contrada had not won for twenty two years so everyone was unable to contain themselves and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ joy . We watched the winning contrada carry their jockey Jonatan Bartoletti ( " Scompiglio " ) to grab the banner , or il cencio ( rag ) and joyously march to the Duomo chanting and singing along the way . At the Duomo there was more jubilation as the entire contrada pushed their way into the Duomo carrying the banner . When the trainer brought the horse into the piazza in front of the Duomo many rushed over to kiss it in thanks , and Dario explained that for this contrada , this win was monumental as most of the young people had never experienced a win in their lives . <p> It was the most intense ninety seconds I have ever experienced and I found that after seeing the collision of horses and riders that I was truly shaking , though I continued to try and get a few photos of the race . Luckily , we learned later that only one horse ended up with injuries and was rushed to a veterinary hospital for treatment . We were also told , and I hope it is true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as they often do to injured race horses in the US , but would be moved to a horse farm outside of Siena and live out the rest of its life in comfort . <p> Obviously , this is an event that is considered very controversial and animal rights protestors continually demand that the Palio be stopped , particularly after a race such as the one we watched take place where six horses fell . I personally have very mixed feelings about it myself , as though I detest seeing any animal injured , I can not help but be enthralled by the history and passion involved in the Palio . Attending the Palio with someone as knowledgable as Dario really helped us understand how important this event is to the Sienese people , and for me it was a very moving and emotional experience . Though I am truly sorry a horse was injured , I am happy I was able to experience the Palio as completely as we did thanks to Dario with his vast knowledge of , and passion for the Palio .

It was on my bucket list , as well . The actual event exceeded even my highest expectations : thrill , pageantry and a glimpse into antiquity .

It was an experience I 'll never forget and you describe it so well , the memories are flooding back . <p> I 'm with you and Pam this is a thrill . There is just no describing the visceral feeling of being swept up in the communal excitement .

I found that I had to remind myself that the city and its culture are steeped in the tradition of this race , and although I am disquieted by the suffering sometimes undergone by the animals , I must respect the people and their customs . I am sure that they too are faced with the same dilemma . " Compartmentalization " is the name of the game for me . <p> From the build-up , to the selection through to the Benediction , the races and celebrations , the Palio di Siena is unmatched for a genuine walk back in time . It sounds like you had a ball . Thanks for sharing your Palio Experience . It was a positively wonderful read ! <p> I enjoyed reading your Palio report . I did not have the experience of see the Palio because the first time I went to Siena , I did n't  know enough to try for tickets really early . However , I was able to see one of the practice runs from stands in the Campo . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found out to go early to the steps of the Duomo . I saw the horse being led into the chapel in the hospital/museum across from the Duomo . The the best experience there was having a great view of all the contrade march in and perform their flag and drum routines for the Archbishop who was watching from his window . I believe the winner that year was the Oca Contrada , whose chpel is the chapel in the house of St. Catherine . The next day I walked down the steep hill to the front of that chapel . Couldnt get in , but I could see the Contrada flag tied around the neck of the Saints statue . Even without the main race , it was a great experience .

It is not too sweet , and by combining both dried and fresh apricots , the fruit flavor is very pronounced .

Strangely enough , it was my husband 's cycling group from Naples , Florida who first decided Corsica would be a great place to visit and bike around . This same group rode from Goult , Provence where a friend has a home all the way to our place here in Umbria two years ago and were looking for another challenge . There are eight riders who signed up for this Corsican trip ranging in ages from fifty-two to seventy-five .

Everyone then had one free day to rest up after their travels and to get their bikes in order before the trip began . I posted a map of our trip below , but we headed from Ajaccio to Bonafacio the first day where we took a boat tour of the amazing white cliffs .

From Calvi we headed down the West coast to Piano , which is a Unesco site , and we were able to take another boat tour to see the amazing red volcanic cliffs on that coast . From Piano , we ended up back in Ajaccio where the cycling trip completed . The cyclists all did an amazing job , traveling almost six hundred miles by bike that included over forty-eight thousand feet of climbing .

I honestly never expected to enjoy our Corsican adventure as much as I did . I must admit that I went into this trip thinking it would be an interesting island to explore , but one I probably would n't have chosen to visit on my own . The island however , is stunningly beautiful with completely different landscapes from one coast to the next and I would certainly enjoy going back in the future .

This stromboli will actually keep well for a couple of days wrapped tightly in the refrigerator . Just allow it to come all the way to room temperature before serving . <p> Do n't  worry if your braiding is n't perfect , the stromboli will only look more " rustic " and homemade . You can also make a " pizza " stromboli that children will love by using just pepperoni sausage and mozzarella with a side of marinara sauce for dipping .

A well made gnocchi should be delicate enough to be described as tender , yet sturdy enough to hold its own when combined with sauce . Gnocchi are basically dumplings , and can be made of almost any ingredients that can be formed into a dough . Gnocchi , ( pronounced NYOK-ee ) are made in most regions in Italy , although they are generally made with different ingredients in each . Some gnocchi are round while others are oval and grooved to hold the sauce . <p> If you have never experienced a really good dish of gnocchi , you have missed a special treat . Luckily gnocchi can easily be made at home and are in fact quicker to make than homemade pasta . If you are a beginner to gnocchi making , I would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gnocchi take a little more practice to get the texture right , and tend to be heavier as they are often overworked . A tip I was given when I first started making potato gnocchi was to add an egg to the dough which helps create dough that holds together well . With experience you soon can eliminate the egg , and create an even lighter dough . You can make really make ricotta gnocchi in as little time as it takes you to boil the water to cook them in , so they can be considered Italian " fast food " . No matter which gnocchi you make , there are some basic tips to remember . See step by step photos for making gnocchi below ! <p> Gnocchi Tips For Preparation And Cooking : <p> The amount of flour needed for the recipe depends on the moisture content of the other ingredients . I always let my ricotta drain in a sieve before I use it to my my ricotta gnocchi , and if I am using spinach I squeeze it very dry before chopping . <p> Only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calls for initially . The less flour you use the lighter the gnocchi you can achieve . <p> Knead your gnocchi dough only as long as it takes for the ingredients to hold together into a soft , workable dough . The longer you knead , the more flour you will use , which will result in a heavier gnocchi . Remember , a light hand yields light , delicate gnocchi ! <p> It is a good idea if you are brand new to gnocchi making to test your gnocchi before you prepare the whole batch . Drop a couple of gnocchi into boiling water and remove as soon as they come to the surface . If they fall apart , knead in a little more flour . If they hold up well , continue cutting the rest of your gnocchi . <p> To cook ricotta gnocchi , always use a large pot of boiling , salted water . Try to gently drop them into the water separately , and remove them as soon as they float to the surface . If you overcook any type of gnocchi they will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to create grooves in my gnocchi , but you can do this easily by gently pushing each piece of gnocchi against the tines of a fork and letting them roll off . <p> Ricotta gnocchi do n't keep well at room temperature ; so if you are not cooking them right away , place them on a lightly floured baking sheet in the refrigerator . I would not keep any type of ricotta gnocchi in the refrigerator longer than a few hours . Generally ricotta gnocchi do n't freeze well unless they have a good deal of flour added , which means they will not be as delicate as good gnocchi should be . Since you can prepare them so quickly , it is easier to make them fresh each time . <p> Ricotta Gnocchi Step By Step <p> All you need to make Ricotta Gnocchi for 4 servings are : <p> 1 Pound Full Fat Ricotta <p> 1 1/2 Cups All-purpose Flour <p> 1/3 Cup Grated Parmesan Cheese <p> 1 Large Egg <p> Before starting , place ricotta in a sieve over a bowl or large cup and let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one hour . <p> First add the grated cheese and egg to the ricotta and stir with a fork just until blended .

I generally roll mine about 1 inch thick if I am topping it with a heavier sauce . <p> To roll use fingers of both hands on a lightly floured surface and gently roll back and forth until you reach the desired thickness . <p> Once you have created your roll , take a sharp knife and cut into 1 inch pieces .

Place the tray in the refrigerator until needed . To cook the gnocchi , bring a large pasta pot filled with salted water to a boil . Once boiling , gently drop the gnocchi into the pot . Once the gnocchi have risen to the top ( less than 5 minutes ) they are cooked . Drain and toss the gnocchi with your desired sauce and serve hot . <h> Did you like this post ?

Unfortunately , I also plan a number of courses that come before dessert that I want to share with family and friends , so that by the time we get to dessert everyone is quite full . That is why panna cotta is the perfect dessert when entertaining . You can prepare it from start to finish hours before you plan to serve it so you do not have to worry about fussing with it when your guests arrive , and it is very light . Just the right touch after a big meal ! Panna cotta translates as cooked cream , and is simply a sweetened cream and milk combination that is flavored and then set into a pudding with the use of gelatin . <p> What I enjoy most about making panna cotta is that I can play around with flavorings and garnishes or sauces and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The options are truly endless !

If you do use forms like I did in my version , do oil them well to prevent the pudding from sticking . When removing the pudding from ramekins or forms , you can run a knife around the outside edge , and if it still sticks a bit , lower the bottom of the container into a bowl of very warm water being careful not to let the water touch the pudding .

The nectar is thicker and has a more pronounced flavor which works really well in this pudding . Since the apricot flavor of my panna cotta was light and fresh , I did n't  want to use a heavy sauce or other strong flavored garnish and instead chose fresh fruit . I simply diced up some fresh , ripe peaches and apricots , tossed them with a little sugar and a squeeze of lemon and served a spoonful alongside my pretty puddings .

Being French Canadian by birth , I do not think kale ever made it into our refrigerator while I was growing up , and at that time I 'm sure I would n't have known kale from a potato if you had asked me to describe it . After we moved to Italy , although we ate many varieties of greens , kale as we know it here in the US just was n't readily available . Italians enjoy types of greens , but broccoli rabe , bietola , rapini , and the typical head of cabbage seem to be more popular than kale .

Although I do like most greens , the rich , earthy flavor of kale for me somehow now makes spinach taste pretty insipid . I do urge you to try replacing kale in place of other greens in your recipes , and I am sure you 'll enjoy the flavor and your body will also thank you ! <p> How To Buy : Look for deeply colored , crisp leaves free of blemishes .

@@25143767 @5143767/ <h> Wild Boar Stew Spezzatino di Cinghiale <p> Umbria is a landlocked region , and because of that , meat , particularly pork , beef , and lamb , are extremely popular . Umbrians also eat a lot of game , including wild boar , pigeons , pheasant , rabbit and hare . I have to admit , that I have never been one to get very adventurous with game , and the few times I tried wild boar , known as cinghiale , in a restaurant I was not terribly impressed . It has been hunting season here in Umbria this past month , cinghiale season in fact , and every weekend we see the hunters up and down our road hunting wild boar . Earlier this week we had a knock on our door and it was one of the locals who gifted us with the hind quarter of a cinghiale much to my dismay . Having never cooked wild boar myself , I honestly did n't  know what to do with it but thank goodness for the internet . I did a quick search to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our cinghiale to prepare it , and read that it was best turned into stew , and simply cook it in sauce long and slow . I got out the slow cooker , onions , celery , and garlic , and had my husband cut the meat into pieces and trim it . <p> We browned the meat in a large frying pan first , then threw everything into our slow cooker and set the timer for 8 hours . After the cooking time was up , the meat was falling apart so we knew it was ready to eat . I must say that I was pleasantly surprised , as the stew was very tasty and the overall flavor of the stew was great . Though we ordinarily would serve this stew over polenta , we decided simply to eat it from the bowl as is with a sprinkling of gremolata on top . Gremolata is a combination of lemon zest , garlic , parsley that I find really brings braised meats and stews to life . Traditionally served on Osso Buco , I also like it on braised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one . <p> Our fridge was a little bare after our recent trip to Puglia , but feel free to add chopped carrots , and even mushrooms to this stew as well . If you are not lucky enough to find wild boar , you could certainly substitute an equal amount of stewing beef for the boar . To cook the stew stovetop instead of a slow cooker , simply slowly simmer for 2 1/2 to 3 hours in a flame-proof covered casserole . <h> 6 comments on " Wild Boar Stew Spezzatino di Cinghiale " <p> I found your blog through the Facebook group , food blogger friends and I 'm so glad I did .

Next day chop lots of onions ( ideally in proportion 1:1 with the meat , 1:2 would also do ) , slooooooooowly fry them on half olive oil/half butter in a covered stove for at least half hour . Meat : drain the marinade and add the meat to the softened onions , add some juniper berries , a bay leaf and a little thyme and rosemary and cook for at least 2 hrs . If needed , add some red wine and/or water for the cooking . Regulate the salt and pepper ( instead or along with salt you may use a little bit of a stock cube to round the flavour ) . Serve with some " patate in tecia " ( I love the version with smoked bacon ) , sp+tzli , mashed potatoes , kanedeli , polenta or just a piece of plain good bread .

@@25143771 @5143771/ <h> Olive Oil Orange Cake <p> I have very simple tastes when it comes to sweets I make myself at home . Perhaps it is because I do not often have the patience to spend hours putting together elaborate desserts , but when I am in the mood to bake something , it can usually be put together quickly and without too many fancy ingredients . I like desserts that can be enjoyed at breakfast as well as after dinner and probably most of all , I love a good fruit flavored olive oil cake . Heck , I think I just plain love olive oil and would put it in my morning coffee if I could get away with it , but that 's another story altogether . This is one of my favorite cakes to make as there are just a handful of ingredients and it has a lovely fresh , orange flavor . <p> I first tasted an amazing orange flavored olive oil cake when we dined in Panzano at Dario Cecchinis butcher shop .

Most of the olive oil cake recipes I found used the zest from many oranges but did n't  use the pulp or juice which just did n't  make sense to me . I remember long ago making an orange flavored quick bread where I threw the entire orange into a food processor and used that mix of juice , pulp and skin to flavor the bread with so I decided to simply play around in the kitchen and see if I could get the flavor and texture I was looking for . I was very lucky that I came up with a winner on my first try , but this cake has everything I was looking for . It is sweetly flavored with orange without being too bitter which can happen if you use too much of the zest , the olive oil kept it very moist , and the 4 eggs I added helped to keep the cake light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a problem in some olive oil cake recipes . Just do not use extra virgin olive oil for this cake as the flavor of the oil can be too much for the orange flavoring .

@@25143781 @5143781/ <h> Soffritto The Holy Trinity of Italian Cuisine <p> A holy trinity in cooking is simply a combination of three aromatic ingredients , whether they are vegetables , herbs or spices , that are gently sauteed together to provide a flavor base for other ingredients to build upon . These ingredients are usually cooked in either butter or olive oil to release their flavors and are used commonly when creating soups , sauces , stews , or braises . In Italian cuisine , this holy trinity is also called a " soffritto " , " odori " , or " battuto " and usually include onions , celery , and carrots in a 2:1:1 ratio which in france is called mirepoix . In most of Italy this soffritto is gently sauteed in olive oil , although in some northern Italian regions such as Lombardy or Veneto , butter may be used as well . <p> Although some may debate that the holy trinity of Italian cuisine is really tomato , garlic , and basil , most do agree that the vegetable combination , or soffritto is more commonly used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are cooked for about 5 minutes until they soften and become " dorata " or golden in color , at which time other ingredients are added such as rice , meat , broth , tomatoes etc . <p> Soffritto is the Italian word for " under-fried " or " fried slowly " and perfectly describes the process of gently cooking the vegetables in oil to soften them and release their flavor . At times , other ingredients are also included into the primary three vegetables and these could include parsley , leeks , garlic , chopped pancetta , or other fresh , chopped herbs . Purists would say you must use a mezzaluna , which is a crescent shaped knife that fits into a rounded wooden board to chop your soffritto , but really any sharp chefs knife works just fine . <p> One tip I learned from experience was to always keep some chopped soffritto in my freezer for when I felt the urge to cook . This cuts down my prep time considerably , and I always know I have that important holy trinity in my freezer ready @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when you visit any outdoor market and purchase vegetables , you are kindly asked if you would like some " odori " . Not being one to ever turn down fresh vegetables I always accept , and the stall owner will throw into my bag a stalk or two of celery , a couple of carrots , an onion , and sometimes a small bunch of parsley . Since I love visiting these markets sometimes multiple times in one week , I have in the past found that I was collecting my soffritto ingredients faster than I could use them and they were in fact crowding my refrigerator . What I did was to chop together all my carrots , celery , onions , and as well as some parsley and divide these chopped vegetables into small freezer bags . Into the freezer they went , and now when I am in the mood to cook I simply grab a handful of my frozen already chopped soffritto and saute it in a little olive oil . The vegetables do not suffer from the freezing process and I always have them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always say fresh is always better ( I usually agree ! ) , but there are times in life when convenience may take precedence and if it helps encourage you to cook more often because it cuts down the time spent in the kitchen than I say go for it . <p> If you love to cook as I do , I highly recommend that you spend a couple of hours chopping together some onion , celery , and carrots in the all important ratio of 2:1:1 and store the chopped vegetables in your freezer in air-tight bags . I generally cut my vegetables quite small ( about 1/2 inch or less ) so I can use them in anything including a delicate risotto dish . As well as cutting down prep time which is always important in todays busy times , you will always know that you have this flavor base handy when you want to throw together a quick pasta sauce , soup , or even create a crock-pot stew .

I had hoped that by going to Florence early in the week , a Tuesday it turned out , that perhaps it might be less crowded than on my last few trips . Unfortunately that did not prove true , and it seems that during " tourist season " from Easter through to October , that Florence is busy every day . I would have skipped Florence altogether this trip since my experience there last year was not a favorable one , but my daughter-in-law had never been to Italy before , and we felt since we were in Tuscany we needed to take her there .

There even is a copy of Michelangelo 's David in the piazza , as well as outdoor cafes packed with tourists , and artists selling their interpretation of the great city created in oils , water colors and pastels . From this piazza set high above the city , it is possible to see just how beautiful it really is , apart from the crowds and noise of the motorcycles . We spent some time there admiring the view , watching the tourists bargain with the street vendors , and taking photographs from every angle before heading down into the city . <p> I had decided before we arrived in Florence , that the church of Santa Croce would be the one place I would insist we all visited .

As well as Michelangelo ( shown in the photo at the left ) , Dante , and Galileo , you can also find Machiavelli and Rossini entombed in the church . We moved slowly through the church , exploring its treasures while we weaved in and out of the tour groups around us . The artwork inside the church is truly impressive , particularly the frescoes in the two chapels situated on either side of the high alter at the front of the church .

The area around Santa Croce is full of leather factories and stores , and many of them we noticed were packed with tour groups as we passed by . The Piazza del Duomo was crowded with tour groups when we arrived , and there was a good sized line in to visit the inside of the duomo . Instead of trying to get inside , we simply walked around massive structure taking photographs , and admiring its neo Gothic appearance . The Battistero , or Babtistery in front of the duomo is wonderful to see , with it 's bronze Renaissance doors decorated with panels designed by Ghiberti .

No reservations are taken until late dinner , and people are seated on a " first come , first serve " basis . Although the food is simple , it is delicious and not badly priced for a city as expensive as Florence can be . A jug of Chianti wine is placed on your table if you are interested , and at the end of the meal , you are charged according to what is left in the bottle . <p> To begin our meal , we each ordered one of the traditional Tuscan soups offered including Pappa al Pomodoro ( Tomato and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Minestrone .

The thick slabs of steak came nicely grilled on the outside , and rare inside , served with lemon wedges . I decided to order something different since I was not in the mood for steak , and I chose Salsiccia e Fagiole ( Sausage and Beans ) dish . To complete our main course , we ordered side salads and a plate of Tuscan beans . My dish came with two sausages on a bed of beans cooked in tomato sauce .

Broccoli rabe is commonly mixed with the pasta , though I added a twist to the traditional recipe by including some chopped sun-dried tomatoes and then serving the hot pasta with a dollop of creamy goat cheese . <p> Cooks Note : You can also add 1 pound of crumbled sausage meat to this dish for a change in place . Just brown the sausage first , and add to the oil mixture . Generally grated cheese is not offered due to the red peppers , but I do like to add some grated pecorino or parmesan to mine . 
@@25143891 @5143891/ <h> A Florence Break June 2013 <p> One of the best features about our farmhouses in Umbria is the location . We sit up on a hill with gorgeous views and have complete solitude and the only sounds I hear throughout the day are usually church bells or birds singing . We are just minutes off of E45 however , and can reach many Umbrian hill towns in under an hour . Being situated in central Umbria also means we are equal distance between Rome and Florence , and when we want to get away from our quiet country life for a taste of a larger city , we often head off for the day to either Rome or Florence . A day in one of these wonderful cities usually includes lunch at one of our favorite restaurants , shopping for me , and a leisurely stroll to admire some of the amazing landmarks . We usually take off for a " city break " about once every 6 to 8 weeks and although we always enjoy our day away , the noise and crowds we find in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hills of Umbria even more . <p> We have our niece and her family visiting this week , and once we heard that they had never been to Florence we decided we would all go for the day since we have yet to visit Florence since returning to Italy early May . It was a gorgeous day in Florence though the rain returned just as we were heading out of the city . No matter how many times I visit Florence , I am always amazed at the beauty of this Tuscan city and its breathtaking historical landmarks that one seems to find around every corner . We had a fun , full day in Florence but were all happy to head home to our place in Umbria at the end of the day . <p> I LOVE your newsletters and recipes . Weve been to Italy four times thus far , and the next visit will be to Umbria . Were seriously thinking about staying at a place such as yours . The location sounds amazing . Thanks , Deborah . <p> Love these pictures ! We just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it already . We are a gluten and dairy free household and found the italian people to be so kind and accomodating . I still can taste the ( celiac safe ) farinata I was munching on while walking in Riomaggiore CT . And the first thing I did when I got home was order up some jovial olive oil . So spoiled to taste tuscan olive oil that is as delicious as a drink ! <p> I have your Calabrian ribs recipe cooking in my oven right nowslightly modified because of lacking a few ingredients in the pantry but they will be delicious nonetheless ! I 've made them already and they turned out fabulous . <p> My husband does not like ribs ( I know , odd for an american ) so I was shocked when he gobbled these up . I thought they would be too salty but they are not . I thought that the ribs needed to have a sweeter element to the sauce and they do not ! They are different and delicious ! 
@@25143917 @5143917/ <h> Olive Focaccia <p> Flatbreads such as this one are great cut into small strips and served as bread with your meals , or cut into larger squares and used to make sandwiches . This focaccia is a little different than most that I make in that I use a biga or starter made the day before . I find the biga gives this flatbread a little more depth of flavor and a little firmer texture while still maintaining a light bread . For a change , I studded the top of this focaccia with black , imported olives , and substituted 2 cups of the all-purpose flour for white whole wheat flour from King Arthurs . I would n't suggest using regular whole wheat dough however , as the bread would be too dense . If you do n't  have access to the white whole wheat flour , simply use all-purpose unbleached flour . Although this bread is great on its own , it is one of my favorite focaccia recipes to make for sandwiches . By varying the size of the pans , you can create a thinner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ideal for sandwiches as I have made here . <p> I find that black , imported olives to have a richer , earthier flavor that works much much better in breads than green olives , but you try try green if you prefer , or even a mix of the two . This bread freezes well , so you might want to double the recipe . Instead of placing the olives on top of the bread , you could also chop the olives and work them into the dough itself . <p> Buon Appetito !
