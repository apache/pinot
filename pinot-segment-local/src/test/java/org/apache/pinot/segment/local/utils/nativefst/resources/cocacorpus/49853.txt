The flow of the match can determine what I play as well . When the score is 1-1 , I 'm not going to play as high energy of music as I would when the score is 20-19 . " <p> Customizing his playlists for each match : " I 'm definitely trying to give each countrys fans a little taste of home . I 'm also trying to add a little Brazilian flavor as much as possible to give everyone the feeling of where these Games are taking place . " <p> Songs that are fan favorites : " They always chant along to Seven Nation Army by the White Stripes and sing to Barbra Streisand by Duck Sauce . But my favorite song they 've responded to so far , which I was n't anticipating , is Sound Bang by Major Lazer . The drums are so contagious in the song that even the people next to me in the DJ booth have to clap along . " <p> DJing at the Olympics versus at domestic matches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its own regardless of sport . But the biggest difference in DJing an international event versus a domestic event is domestically you do n't  have a home and away team . The fans generally like both teams on the court , so they 're not cheering for one team over the other . Internationally , you could have the whole crowd cheering for one team . At the Olympics , the fans are so much more invested in their team that when their team loses , they feel the pain a lot more than they would at a domestic event . " <p> Favorite moment of the Olympics so far : " Seeing my friends from the AVP perform on the biggest stage and hearing that Mike Tirico said the MVP might be the DJ referring to me and Tobias live on NBC has been special , but so far the Samoilovs/Smedins ( LAT ) vs . Schalk/Saxton ( CAN ) match still gives me goosebumps just thinking about it .

Pioneer DJ has no intention of selling huge numbers of it to DJs ( theyll certainly be happy to take your money if you want one , though ) .

@@96432409 @632409/ <h> Reloop RP-8000 Turntable Review <h> Introduction <p> With the Technics 1200 no longer in production , DJs who prefer the touch of vinyl and pull of a direct drive motor have until recently faced a difficult decision : dive into the unreliable world of Craigslist hoping to find previously owned 1200s or switch to alternatives by Vestax ( 2000 and 3000 ) , Stanton ( 150 ) , and Numark ( TTX ) . <p> Enter Reloop . <p> Back in December , British turntablist DJ Angelo was featured in a two-minute routine video ( see below ) which showcased Reloops new and mysterious RP-8000 turntable . Being the gear heads that we are , we were immediately intrigued by the device and thrilled when Reloop gave us the opportunity to review it . <p> Upon first glance , the RP-8000 looks like an updated Technics 1200 . This was probably an intentional decision by Reloop , as the 1200 has been the industry standard for over 30 years and remains the weapon of choice for many DJs . <p> However , despite its striking resemblance , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the 1200 ( or any other turntable for that matter ) . The 8000s attractive MIDI capability , convenient drum pad section and precise pitch resolution are all standout features . <h> Pros <p> High-quality design The RP-8000s design is sturdy and straightforward . In terms of weight , its slightly lighter than the Technics 1200 and Numark TTX and about the same as the Vestax PDX-3000 . The RP-8000s rubber feet and tone arm are practically identical to that of the 1200 as both come with stock Hanpin parts . We put the RP-8000 through hours of scratching , mixing and juggling and it stood up acceptably . <p> Plenty of features The digital pitch display , high-resolution +/-8/16/50 pitch , scroll/load wheel , and double start/stop buttons are just a few bells and whistles that set the RP-8000 apart from the 1200 . The real prize is the built-in and fully MIDI map-able drum pad section that 's essentially a built-in Dicer . The pads are soft and responsive and you can seamlessly switch between cue , loop , and sample modes with the performance mode buttons . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steady and handles rigorous cutting like any other turntable on the market . We tested the table with our Shure M44-7 needle and it tracked to our standards . <p> Versatility The RP-8000 comes with native mapping packs for Serato and Traktor and can be also used with any MIDI mappable DJ software . It combines the powerful capabilities of a modern DJ controller with the trusted mechanics of a classic DJ turntable . <h> Cons <p> Platter gap One of the best things about the RP-8000 is that the platter is visually and tactilely similar to that of the 1200 . Unfortunately , the RP-8000s platter rests about two centimeters above the turntable instead of flush against it . The result is a gap between the platter and turntable frame , which annoys us . Throughout our years of DJing , we 've become accustomed to rubbing our fingers along the bottom of the platter as a way to slow or speed up the pitch . Although we eventually adjusted to it , the RP-8000 is the only turntable that we 've used that has this gap . <p> Requires l-shaped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we found . If you 're setup in battle style , you 'll need an l-shaped power cable and angled RCA cables otherwise therell be a gap in between your turntable and mixer . <p> Update : Reloop has informed us that the RP-8000 now comes with right angle cables . <p> Only one control for start and brake We love that its possible to set the start and brake time but why did n't  Reloop give them individual controls ? We never want our turntables to start slowly but we also like having our brake set to the length found on a 1200 . However , you 're out of luck if you want to set the start time and brake time at separate speeds . <p> High cost At around $800 a piece , the RP-8000 is n't exactly a cheap purchase . However , its quality and design warrant the price especially for those intending to utilize them to their fullest capability . <h> Conclusion <p> Reloops RP-8000 is probably the most powerful turntable currently on the market . After playing with it for a few hours , we fell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when triggering cues , loops , and samples . However , if it werent for a couple minor design flaws , it would be one of the best turntables on the market . <p> Some Technics fans will continue to swear allegiance to the 1200 but the RP-8000 is a serious contender . For turntablists , it provides the stability and ruggedness that 's required for competitive use . And for mix DJs , the high-resolution pitch , cue point and loop triggers provide advantages in the club . <p> We recommend the RP-8000 for intermediate to experienced DJs ( both turntablists and mix DJs alike ) who understand the power of its capabilities . <p> How is the wow and flutter ? Specs say +/- .01% , which is the same as the 1200s . Legit claim ? The PLX-1000 specs say +/- .1% which is no good for long mixes and blends . Curious as to how the two compare .

@@96432480 @632480/ <h> Why DJs Should n't Worry About Apples New MacBook Pro <p> The USB 3.1 standard and its accompanying USB-C connector have been around since 2013 and 2014 , respectively . Theyve been used in many phones , Windows computers , and Apples 12-inch MacBook over the last year . However , DJs have had little reason to pay attention to USB 3.1 and USB-C until recently . <p> On October 27 , Apple unveiled its new MacBook Pro , which does away with the traditional USB ports and replaces them with four Thunderbolt 3/USB-C ports ( Thunderbolt 3 and USB-C use the same connector ) . The elimination of the classic USB ports , which is the standard for most DJ equipment , has sparked panic in the DJ community . However , despite the concern , DJs have nothing to worry about . <p> USB 3.1 is the latest USB standard <p> USB 3.1 is the most recent USB standard . The fundamental difference between each specification comes down to how fast they can transfer data , and how much power they can draw from or send @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that means up to a 10Gbps transfer rate ( double that of USB 3.0 ) . It also means enough power to charge a 15-inch laptop like the MacBook Pro , instead of just smartphones . <p> USB specifications are backward compatible <p> You can plug a USB 2.0 device into a USB 3.0 socket , and vice-versa ( provided the ports match up ) . You wo n't see an increase in data transfer " - the chain always defaults to the slowest link " - but you can still transfer data . The same applies to USB 3.1 . <p> Photo credit : Lance Ulanoff/Mashable <p> USB-C is just a type of connector <p> There are many different types of USB connectors , all of which support the same USB protocol . For example , there 's no reason that you cant connect a Rane SL interface into a USB-C port on a laptop . However , you 'll need a cable with a USB-C on one side ( for the laptop ) and USB-B on the other ( for the SL box ) . You can also use an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a " pure " USB-C system . That means that cables must be designed to detect which way they are connected so that power and data flow in the right direction . Cables that are n't designed with that capability could potentially damage your equipment . Because of this , we recommend only buying USB-C cables and adapters from known brand name vendors like Apple and Belkin . <p> Thunderbolt 3 does n't  affect DJ hardware <p> One of the cool things about the new MacBook Pro is that its ports are n't  limited to USB . As mentioned above , they also support Thunderbolt 3 . For example , you can plug a Thunderbolt 3 external hard drive into one of the ports and transfer data at speeds up to 40Gbps , depending on the cable used . You can even use a regular ( good quality ) USB-C cable in that situation . The connectors also support power , internet , and video ( HDMI , VGA , DisplayPort , and Thunderbolt ) . So , if your only concern is connecting an audio interface or controller to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the ports other capabilities . <p> Conclusion <p> At the end of the day , there 's no reason for DJs to freak out about the Macbook Pros new ports or any other computer with similar technology . While its unlikely that well see new DJ equipment with USB-C anytime soon , its important to know that the MacBooks new USB ports wo n't impact your ability to connect to your existing USB gear . You might need some new cables or adapters , but that should be the worst of it . <p> Check out CNETs recent article to learn more about USB-C and Thunderbolt 3 . <p> Thanks for posting this . So many DJs have been freaking out over the lack of USB ports on the new MacBooks , and for no reason . USB is literally " turn of the century " technology . Did everyone expect old-timey USB to be around forever ? <p> Kire Gjorgov <p> The most Unique thing about the Macbook was the Glowing apple logo and now its gone it used to be a symbol of being cool etc . Mac pros @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but now with all the new features its gon na take some time to adapt without the MagSafe and other stuff . <p> https : //www.woodzmuzik.com Anthony Woodruffe <p> This is all well and good but let 's look at this a bit closer . I do n't  use a laptop to DJ , I use pioneer XDJ-1000s . Thats USB 2.0 Technology . Yet I use USB 3.0 Keys . There is no gain when they are in the Pioneer units but I get a massive gain exporting tracks from Rekordbox . The only way I can get those tracks onto those USB-keys is with a USB-C to USB-A Adapter ( preferably 3.0 ) Now I carry my laptop with me mainly as a backup but sometimes I 'll link direct to Rekordbox at non-private events . ( Its a German GEMA thing , do n't  worry about it ) This is going to require a USB-C to RJ45 Adapter . Its not a major problem until I forget/lose the dongle or its stolen . Then quite simply , I 'm fucking fucked ! <p> Linz <p> I think most users @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ *addition* to the MacBook Pro . The problem was Apple decided to , rather than make it an *addition* , they take away all other ports and expect people to buy and transport dongles with them to use their " pro " laptop . <p> They should have called these new laptops MacBooks , made them cheaper and given the Pro models the ports ( keyboard &amp; power ) that the word " pro " dictates . <p> Its becoming an unfunny joke , " what 's apple going to take away this upgrade ?

@@96432570 @632570/ <h> Pioneer DJ <p> Back in January , we reported that Pioneer DJs new TOUR system was one of the most unusual new products at this years NAMM Show . The setup , which was composed of four modified CDJs and one modified DJM mixer , was enclosed in a glass display and not available for testing . The lack of accessibility led to speculation that the system could simply just be the DJ equivalent of a concept car . Today , however , Pioneer DJ announced that the TOUR is not only a real product but will be available July . <p> CDJ-TOUR1 <p> The CDJ-TOUR1 is a beefed-up CDJ-2000NXS2 with improved audio quality , adjustable isolator feet , and a separate power supply . It comes with a regular NXS2 touchscreen , plus a 13-inch LCD display , which is attached to the back . The LCD shows much more of rekordboxs interface than what 's available on the NXS2 touchscreen . <p> DJM-TOUR1 <p> The DJM-TOUR1 also has a 13-inch touchscreen , along with a ton of features aimed at improving audio quality . It has an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ highest sound quality when connecting to front-of-house desks in arenas . The unit has a built-in LAN hub with etherCON connectors , which are lockable ( they 're included on the CDJ , too ) . There 's also a pair of independent headphone sections , which make it easier to perform tag team sets with one mixer . <p> Price <p> The big thing that stands out is the price : $5,000 for the CDJ and $6,000 for the DJM . That means that the total cost of a four-deck system is a whopping $26,000 . Its important to realize that the TOUR system is n't intended for regular DJs , though . Pioneer DJ has no intention of selling huge numbers of it to DJs ( theyll certainly be happy to take your money if you want one , though ) . Rather , the TOUR is for companies that produce large festivals , arena concerts , etc . The pro-level audio connections and ease of integration clearly suggest that . <p> LCD Display <p> The LCD displays provide a lot of detailed information , which is n't available on regular CDJ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ angle , you 'll be creating a wall between yourself and the audience . Is the information and functionality that the displays provide worth the compromise in visibility ? That remains to be seen ( no pun intended ) . <p> PLX version ? <p> As of right now , Pioneer has only introduced TOUR versions of the CDJ and DJM . Digital devices do n't  really have issues with isolation and feedback like analog decks do , though . With that in mind , it would be nice to see a TOUR version of Pioneer DJs PLX-1000 turntable . <p> Final thoughts <p> DJcity will not be reviewing the TOUR system or the individual CDJ and DJM units , as they 're not designed for regular DJs .

He also found out he can do the same type of performance without the hassle of other DVS systems . <p> So , what is it about rekordbox that Trentino loves so much ? Read his five reasons why below . <p> Quicker Switchovers <p> After seeing one of the most well-known turntablists in the world kill the vibe of his party by spending 20 minutes setting up before his set , I realized I could no longer justify my own absurdly long switch-overs . <p> Long switchovers suck for everyone . They suck for those performing before and after you , who are hindered for the first or last part of their set . They suck for the crowd , who has to listen to the same eight-minute song while you set up your interface and controllers and plug in a dozen different cables . And they suck for you , who has to do the equivalent of diffusing a bomb before your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entrance on stage . <p> Easier Traveling <p> I used to travel with two of nearly everything : two laptops ( I had my entire music library synced between them using SugarSync ) , two pairs of control records , two pairs of Dicers , two pairs of needles , two Serato interfaces , etc . Rekordbox not only eliminates the need for a computer and interface but the need for controllers due to the built-in hot cues , which have replaced my need for Dicers . <p> Increased Safety and Security <p> In venues where security is lacking , rekordbox frees you from the risk of theft and damage to your equipment . You can carry everything you need in your pockets . Its easy to unplug your drive and headphones and flee the scene if your immediate safety is threatened or you 're being mistreated by the club 's management . <p> Improved Reliability <p> We all know how temperamental turntables , needles , records , and even laptops can be . Having to switchover in a dark club compounds those issues , especially if the DJ before you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . <p> Less Stereotypes <p> As much as I disagree with it , the majority of the people in the industry , especially those on the dance and electronic side , assume that anyone using turntables is a hip-hop DJ . I used to think that guys like Klever and A-Trak had broken down the stereotype , but it 's as strong as ever . Considering that I do n't want to be a hip-hop or top 40 DJ forever , I feel that using CDJs is an important step forward for me . <p> Trentino would like to thank A-Trak for helping make CDJs more acceptable among turntablists , Chicago DJs Metro , Boi Jeanius , and MaddJazz for showing that its possible to rip on CDJs , and Christian Jackson , whose YouTube channel is an indispensable source for learning the ins-and-outs of rekordbox.

Theyve been used in many phones , Windows computers , and Apples 12-inch MacBook over the last year .

The elimination of the classic USB ports , which is the standard for most DJ equipment , has sparked panic in the DJ community . However , despite the concern , DJs have nothing to worry about . <p> USB 3.1 is the latest USB standard <p> USB 3.1 is the most recent USB standard . The fundamental difference between each specification comes down to how fast they can transfer data , and how much power they can draw from or send to a device . In the case of USB 3.1 , that means up to a 10Gbps transfer rate ( double that of USB @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a 15-inch laptop like the MacBook Pro , instead of just smartphones . <p> USB specifications are backward compatible <p> You can plug a USB 2.0 device into a USB 3.0 socket , and vice-versa ( provided the ports match up ) . You wo n't see an increase in data transfer " - the chain always defaults to the slowest link " - but you can still transfer data . The same applies to USB 3.1 . <p> Photo credit : Lance Ulanoff/Mashable <p> USB-C is just a type of connector <p> There are many different types of USB connectors , all of which support the same USB protocol . For example , there 's no reason that you cant connect a Rane SL interface into a USB-C port on a laptop . However , you 'll need a cable with a USB-C on one side ( for the laptop ) and USB-B on the other ( for the SL box ) . You can also use an adaptor . <p> However , the cables are reversible in a " pure " USB-C system . That means that cables must be designed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and data flow in the right direction . Cables that are n't designed with that capability could potentially damage your equipment . Because of this , we recommend only buying USB-C cables and adapters from known brand name vendors like Apple and Belkin . <p> Thunderbolt 3 does n't  affect DJ hardware <p> One of the cool things about the new MacBook Pro is that its ports are n't  limited to USB . As mentioned above , they also support Thunderbolt 3 . For example , you can plug a Thunderbolt 3 external hard drive into one of the ports and transfer data at speeds up to 40Gbps , depending on the cable used . You can even use a regular ( good quality ) USB-C cable in that situation . The connectors also support power , internet , and video ( HDMI , VGA , DisplayPort , and Thunderbolt ) .

While its unlikely that well see new DJ equipment with USB-C anytime soon , its important to know that the MacBooks new USB ports wo n't impact your ability to connect to your existing USB gear .

He was left with no choice but to improvise his entire performance . <p> " My heart dropped 100 feet out of my chest to the floor .

Most of the time even if I have a planned out set I 'll go off-track from it , but especially when we only have 60 minutes to fit in every single awesome track we want to play having a plan of action beforehand can be invaluable .

I do n't  care about proving anyone thinking I 'm a good DJ , mixer , whatever , ALL I care about is making sure every single kid in the crowd has an awesome time .

Also , for the first ever I will not be taking request . <p> MF <p> Lot of the argument comes with many using Rekordbox/Serato/Traktor now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ software there was . <p> The software " forces " you to pre-plan in a way , because you have to scan the tracks in so they instantly load on the player used . Otherwise its waiting to scan them when loaded on a player . Not so good when you 're live . <p> Beyond that in Rekordbox , the key , playlist , tag , and color options allow you to sort your library like never before . It actually allows any pre-planning to be better than ever as you can instantly notate in multiple ways any ideas that come to you while sorting or listening to tracks . <p> As to what happened to Jaz , technology can come with a price . I was in the same boat as between Rekordbox and Windows , they both screwed me bad where I needed backup flash drives to get byand that was also whittled down to , after TRYING to go through each option to make it happen , about 5 minutes before performance where my last option thankfully worked .

Surfing a database on such a tiny screen with no mouse/keyboard is a huge pain even with everything well tagged . <p> Hplar Ajat <p> I think it depends on the environment that the DJ works in . If its a nightclub or bar where , as a house DJ , a shift constitutes a few hours , then no way would I advise preplanning sets . Perhaps planning mini-mixes within a set might be more do-able . If it an appearance for a half-hour or an hour long set , then why not .

Below are some useful tips to help you through the process , courtesy of Australian DJ/producer , Kronic . After spending years as a club DJ , the Gold Coast native eventually took up producing in 2012 . He has since collaborated with artists like Lil Jon , Chuckie , Uberjak 'd , and Far East Movement . <p> Trust your ear . If you 've been DJing for a few years , you probably have a good sense of what works in your sets and what does n't . Your taste in music is what makes you unique as a DJ , so apply it to your production . For example , legendary hip-hop producer Swizz Beatz cut his teeth by making edits of other people 's tracks so that he could play them the way he wanted . Be the change you want to see in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mashups are a great way to learn the basics of producing with Ableton Live . They teach you how to time stretch , EQ , edit tracks , and automate . Once you 've made a couple of blends , try adding some extra elements to make them stand out . <p> Recreate other people 's tracks . The idea is n't to copy other people 's work , but to help you better understand your production equipment . If you 've never made a beat before , a synthesizer 's knobs and buttons can be as confusing as the cockpit controls in an airplane . Watching a tutorial on recreating a specific sound will help familiarize you with your equipment . <p> Remix other peoples tracks . Reach out to established producers and offer to remix their tracks " on spec , " meaning that if they do n't like it , they do n't have to use it . If they accept your offer , give it your best and shot and do n't be afraid to fail . The worst case scenario is that you gain experience and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to remix someone 's track without asking for permission and send it to them when you 're done . This happened to one of my tracks once , and I was so impressed that I made it an official remix . Keep in mind that you 're probably not going to get a response from an artist like Calvin Harris , so focus on producers who are accessible . <p> Collaborate with others . No matter who you are , there 's always something that you can learn from others . That said , collaborations are a fantastic way to learn tips and techniques and share ideas . Chances are , you 're not the only DJ in your city that 's trying to elevate your career by producing . <p> Do n't  worry about having a manager .

One of the biggest advantages of being both a DJ and a producer is that you can test your tracks in front of live audiences before releasing them .

You can even blend your instrumentals with familiar acapellas to play it safe . Either way , do n't be disheartened if your songs do n't sound right on the first play ; pay attention to the crowd response and think about what needs to be improved . <p> Finish what you start . Your first few projects are probably going to suck , but that 's okay . It 's easy to compare your project to a pro 's and feel disheartened , but remember that everyone started at the bottom .

However , after seven years of using a DVS setup at home and shows , the former Red Bull Thre3style US champ recently switched to CDJs and rekordbox . <p> Much to his surprise , Trentino was amazed by how easy the transition was and how much he enjoyed using CDJs . He also found out he can do the same type of performance without the hassle of other DVS systems . <p> So , what is it about rekordbox that Trentino loves so much ? Read his five reasons why below . <p> Quicker Switchovers <p> After seeing one of the most well-known turntablists in the world kill the vibe of his party by spending 20 minutes setting up before his set , I realized I could no longer justify my own absurdly long switch-overs . <p> Long switchovers suck for everyone . They suck for those performing before and after you , who are hindered for the first or last part of their set . They suck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same eight-minute song while you set up your interface and controllers and plug in a dozen different cables . And they suck for you , who has to do the equivalent of diffusing a bomb before your set . Long switchovers kill any chance of making an entrance on stage . <p> Easier Traveling <p> I used to travel with two of nearly everything : two laptops ( I had my entire music library synced between them using SugarSync ) , two pairs of control records , two pairs of Dicers , two pairs of needles , two Serato interfaces , etc . Rekordbox not only eliminates the need for a computer and interface but the need for controllers due to the built-in hot cues , which have replaced my need for Dicers . <p> Increased Safety and Security <p> In venues where security is lacking , rekordbox frees you from the risk of theft and damage to your equipment . You can carry everything you need in your pockets . Its easy to unplug your drive and headphones and flee the scene if your immediate safety is threatened or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Improved Reliability <p> We all know how temperamental turntables , needles , records , and even laptops can be . Having to switchover in a dark club compounds those issues , especially if the DJ before you is using CDJs , which is often the case for me . <p> Less Stereotypes <p> As much as I disagree with it , the majority of the people in the industry , especially those on the dance and electronic side , assume that anyone using turntables is a hip-hop DJ . I used to think that guys like Klever and A-Trak had broken down the stereotype , but it 's as strong as ever . Considering that I do n't want to be a hip-hop or top 40 DJ forever , I feel that using CDJs is an important step forward for me . <p> Trentino would like to thank A-Trak for helping make CDJs more acceptable among turntablists , Chicago DJs Metro , Boi Jeanius , and MaddJazz for showing that its possible to rip on CDJs , and Christian Jackson , whose YouTube channel is an indispensable source for learning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ta LOL a tiny bit at the " A-Trak making it acceptable for Turntablists " comment . While a nice sentimentand perhaps true for Trentino himself , Cut Chemist , Jazzy Jeff , Swamp , etcall these cats were using CDJs in the early 2000s . ActuallyJeff and Swamp were two of the guys ( Roger Sanchez , too ) who REALLY gave the CDJs the credibility amongst DJs , periodnot just turntablists . <p> DerpJesus <p> This is the dumbest thing Ive ever read in regards to djing <p> Ray BlackRabbit Brown III <p> please elaborate on how this is dumb , seems like some valid points to me <p> LazyDJs <p> I totally agree lost a lot of respect for this guy . " Less stereotypes " ? ? ? How about being a f*cking trendsetter . <p> UCH <p> every reason he s said , apart from the stereotype , is reason ive done same this year . ease of use , not having to unpack all of my serato stuff at airports when I 'm touring , and not having to stare at a laptop anymore and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rider these days , Rekordbox for the win . <p> Sam Resch <p> I feel torn between the 2 . But having said that , if I wan na give 110% I 'm going with serato . It just makes it that little bit easier for you . If I 'm heading out and about and doing short gigs its rekordbox . If I 'm playing an important set for 2 hours + its serato . I strongly agree with all the points listed . However for every point there 's a counter point . Efficiency , auto gain and , yes , even waveforms all count . I personally love to bring my DDJ-SP1 or dicers and love using cue points and effects like echo out are so much easier with serato . I think when you 're in the heat of the moment , and you 're scrambling for that track , efficiency becomes a huge factor . Rekordbox suck for that . Its so fiddy

He also said comparing it with underground deep house and techno is pointless . <p> Fong , who 's known for his high-energy productions , has been on the rise over the last year . He s toured with Tommy Trash and performed at festivals including Ultra , EDC , Electric Zoo , and HARD Summer . <p> Read his full comments below . <p> " Still not sure why some of the underground deep/techno guys are still hating on the mainstage EDM . Its pretty simple as to why its more popular , and why its played on the mainstages . Its very melody/riff based . People relate to melodies , and can sing along . I 'm not saying techno or deep house does n't  have melody at all , some of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dark driving basslines with some percussion and is n't based around a hooky or apparent melody . Oliver Heldens is killing it right now because he makes the groovy stuff but really focuses his tracks around the melody . Both genres have their own feel , and that 's ok . People go through different feelings at different times of their lives , and different music accompanies that . Ive been front row at an Afrojack show going nuts before I did this as a career and I had a great time , then you grow older and your musical tastes morph as you age . Its not really fair for some bitter 40 something year old DJ to be passing judgement on an 18 year old dancing at the mainstage of a big festival , the 18 year old is clearly at a different point and wants to hear more upbeat party oriented music . Its like a stepping stone to other genres of dance music later on . Comparing the two is like comparing apples and oranges , and you 're just wasting your time . To be honest , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a festival and everyone starts chanting the melody , its an incredibly catchy melody , and trust me its not easy to write one like that . Why does that deserve hate from a DJ from another genre who claims to be preserving the roots of dance music , when the root of dance music is the MELODY ! ! " <p> For those curious about Fongs background and production philosophy , check out this interview we did with him in early 2014 : <p> I dislike most EDM and pretty much only play " underground " house and techno and I completely hear where this dude is coming from . Furthermore , melodic songs stay more intact on large outdoor systems .

@@96432667 @632667/ <h> 5 Things You Should Do Before Entering a DJ Battle <p> DJs should do plenty of research and preparation before entering a DJ battle . This goes for both newcomers and veterans alike . Below is a list of five essential tips , which apply to everything from turntablist battles to party rocking competitions . <p> 1 . Know the battle Each battle has its own rules and its important to understand them so you can plan accordingly . If it 's a party rocking contest , focus on music selection rather than technical DJ skills . If it 's a scratch battle , use unique samples and various scratch combos to set yourself apart . You should also know who 's judging the battle , how the DJs will be scored , and what type of crowd will be in attendance . Crowd reaction is important and having the audience on your side usually results in higher scores . Find out which type of equipment is allowed , too . If you only use CDJs , showing up to a pair of 1200s will ruin your night . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing worse than getting on stage and bombing . At a DJ battle , the pressure is especially high because all eyes and ears are on you , so make sure that you 're fully prepared for the spotlight . This demands hours of practice and patience . Once you 've established a routine that you 're happy with , practice it over and over again . At a certain point , your memory will take control and the routine will become fluid . Many DJs do n't need to wear headphones during their routines because they 've practiced it so much that they know it by heart . This should be your goal , too . <p> 3 . Set it and forget it One of the last things a DJ should do while performing is constantly adjust the volume gains . To avoid this , make sure all the tracks are at the same level when preparing your routine . Weve seen many DJs adjust the levels throughout their sets hoping to achieve optimal sound , only to end up clipping the mixer . <p> 4 . Check @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basic gear . However , each contestant is usually allowed to adjust the equipment 's settings . Always check the equipment before beginning your set to ensure that its up to your liking . For example , if the DJ before you set the crossfader curve to the slowest setting , adjust it to sharp if that 's your preference . The same can be said for mixer effects , level settings , tonearm counterweights , etc . <p> 5 . Know your limits This last tip comes from DJcitys Kid Cut Up , who recently judged at Astro AVLs " Across the Fader " battle in Los Angeles . Cut Up says that the confidence you have at home can fly out the window when you hit the stage . Stress can impair ability , so he recommends reducing the amount of tricks in your routine that are outside your skill set . For example , if juggling is n't your strong suit , wait until you 've mastered it before attempting it in a battle . Its essential that you stay in your lane and execute the cleanest possible set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Share them in the comments below ! <p> Make eye contact with as many people you possibly can . Do n't  look angry if you do n't  normally look angry it just comes off as pouting and trying to hard you never look as bad ass as you think you do . <p> Styles <p> eye contact is definitely important , good point <p> Ricky Djrickyjay Jordan <p> Nice write up ! <p> Joe Walker <p> Always be there for the whole thing no matter if you 're contestant #1 , #4 or #34 that way you 'll get to watch how the audience responds to what the other contestants are throwin down &amp; then you 'll know what is getting them to lose their damn minds . Also do n't  focus too hard on the guy before you and then try to cop his tricks just cause you think " you can doem better . Breaking from what youve already got planned and improvising on the spot will most likely just lead to your downfall . And just like John Swan mentioned eye contact is important and so is looking like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smile , even if you 're hands may be visibly shaking , because confidence you show may just score you that 1 extra point to get you that win . <p> Styles <p> these are all really good tips . i especially like your first one about being there for the whole battle . there 's so much knowledge you can soak up at these things if you 're a DJ that pays attention .

I grew up a DJ and a club head , and I used to come over to the UK with Eric Prydz like 15 years ago .
