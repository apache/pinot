They do it on their terms , using the internet as their primary source of information . Gone are the days when sales representatives would be called or invited to " educate buyers " . The Corporate Executive Board found 57% of the Enterprise Buyer 's Journey takes before vendors get formally engaged . <h> Content is the new currency <p> In response to this trend , Businesses have massively invested in building and sharing content . According to the Content Marketing Institute , marketers are spending 28% of their marketing budget on content marketing . This content is offered to help buyers and potential buyers in the early stages of their exploration . The quality of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ build preference . But the widespread availability of great and valuable content on the internet can also disintermediate brands . So , the understanding of the information consumed by prospects is an essential proxy of their interest . It is further exacerbated by the Social Transformation . Indeed , Social Networks and communities of interest have become places where people share experiences , get feedback on products through peer reviews , and look for information . <h> Purchase democratization <p> Corporations used to have a few Buying Centers where decisions were centralized in the hands of a few , easy to find , roles . Nowadays , a growing number of purchases are made at all levels and functions in the Enterprise . This trend is exemplified by Gartner prediction from a few years ago that , by 2017 , Marketing organizations would spend more on technology than their peer IT groups . Even large purchases made centrally now involve a much larger number of decision makers . Captera found that 2/3 software purchases involve 3 or more people .

They increasingly leverage new communication tools to shift their engagements with prospects and buyers away from in person meetings to the phone , emails , online meetings or other forms of remote interaction . Marc Benioff , the founder of salesforce.com , coined the term of Inside Sales for sales done remotely . He keeps on reminding us that he only used Inside Sales during the first 6 years of his company . This trend compounds with the imperative for sales organizations to become more productive as pointed by Bain . <h> The rise of Inside Selling <p> Topo is predicting that in 2017 , 85% of the hours spent by sales professional , will be so selling remotely .

They have led to the emergence of a new set of tools to : <p> gain insights on companies and potential buyers , <p> steer interactions towards desired goals , <p> improve these interactions with relevant information , <p> increase sales productivity , <p> make remote selling smooth and effortless , and <p> use analytics along the way to drive and , in hindsight , improve the entire selling process . <h> Making sense of a new market ? <p> I lived through this transition as an Executive of the Enterprise Software industry .
