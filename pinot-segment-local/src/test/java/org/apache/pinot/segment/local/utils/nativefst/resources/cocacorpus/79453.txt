@@21641407 @1641407/ <h> How is Keyword Competitiveness Calculated in Long Tail Platinum ? <p> One of the most powerful features of Long Tail Platinum is the Keyword Competitiveness calculation. - This is a formula that will allow you to quickly analyze the top 10 results in Google to determine how difficult any keyword might be to rank for naturally . This is one of the features that separates LTP from many other keyword research software solutions out there . <p> We are always striving to improve the software , and as a result of launching version 3.0 of Long Tail Pro , we thought we should take another look at the Keyword Competitiveness ( KC ) calculation . <p> Search engines are constantly evolving and we want to make sure we give you the best tools for determining your ability to rank in those search engines . <p> When we launched version 3.0 , we made some minor tweaks to the KC calculation. - Because of this , you may see that some of your keywords are a few points higher or lower when comparing 2.0 to 3.0 KC numbers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accurate in version 3.0. - Today I want to reveal a bit more of what goes into the KC number and what we have changed . <p> Now , here is a more descriptive explanation of what goes into determining Keyword Competitiveness : <p> Page Authority : Each website starts with a Page Authority number ; this is where the KC number starts. - Page Authority is a number provided by Moz.com that in and of itself is a very complex calculation. - Page Authority essentially tells you how " authoritative " a particular page is. - Page Authority takes into account things like Domain Authority , site age , juice page links , social signals , and more . <p> We take this Page Authority number and then adjust is up or down depending on how well the Page Title , domain , etc. match the given keyword phrase . <p> Page Title : If the exact keyword is in the Title of the page , this is a very strong indicator to Google. - As a result , depending on how closely the results in Google match the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adjust the base Page Authority number down ( if it does n't  match keywords ) or up ( if it matches keywords exactly ) . <p> This is exactly how it should be. - If several really authoritative pages are ranking , but they are not even targeting the keywords in the title of their page , this is a big sign of weakness. - This means that if you simply target the exact keyword in your title , you might be able to outrank all these authoritative pages because they are n't  targeting the exact keyword . <p> The KC formula takes all of this into account and will adjust scores up or down based on how well the pages in Google are targeting the keyword in their titles. - This is the largest factor that goes into determining KC ; how well are the results targeting the keyword . <p> One of the changes we made in version 3 was to adjust the scores down or up a bit further for results that are not targeting the keyword. - Based on our research , this makes the score @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Having exact match keywords in the domain used to be a big deal. - However , as brandable domains have grown in importance , exact match or partial match keyword domain names have grown much less important . <p> As a result , we 've adjusted the Keyword Competitiveness score to no longer give very much weight to keywords in the domain name . <p> Length of Domain : A longer domain name , usually means spammy. - The keyword competitiveness calculation takes this into account and adjust the score down for any domains that are too long . <p> The old version of the KC score did take this into account ; however , the weight has been slightly adjusted so there is not too much weight given to this factor . <p> Overall , the new KC calculation is more accurate than it has ever been before. - So , if you check what the new KC score is for any keywords compared to the old score ; what you see now is the accurate number . <p> I would also like to re-iterate that the scale of competitiveness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 0 to 10 " No competition <p> 10 to 20 " Extremely low competition <p> 20 to 30 " Low competition <p> 30 to 40 " Moderate Competition <p> 40 to 50 " Somewhat High Competition <p> 50 to 60 " Very High Competition <p> 60 to 70 " Extremely High Competition <p> 70 to 100 " Do n't even think about it ! <p> I personally avoid any keywords with a score over 35. - And I prefer to never target keywords with a score over 30 . <p> As a result of this adjusted calculation , many keywords have not changed at all in terms of competitiveness. - The keywords score that have changed are ones that should have changed. - The more competitive keywords are now MORE ACCURATELY showing a higher KC ; while the lower competition keywords are now more accurately showing a lower KC score . <h> Example of the New KC Score in Action <p> We do n't  just talk about trying to find low competition keywords , we are actively finding and ranking for keywords ourselves all the time ! <p> For example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Long Tail Pro blog , and we are starting to see great results . <p> How do we come up with blog post ideas ? - We use Long Tail Pro of course ! - We generate keywords and then start looking closely at those with a low KC score . <p> here 's a screenshot showing the KC score in version 3.0 of Long Tail Pro : <p> A 21 is a very low score. - These are the kinds of keywords that we love ! <p> So , after writing a blog post targeting " Weebly SEO " , we hit publish. - We have not done any link building specifically to that page other than sharing on our social media pages . <p> This post has simply " aged " and moved up the ranks. - Now we rank #7 for the keyword ; all thanks to finding a great low competition keyword using the KC metric . Weve done this with a number of our blog posts for example , we compared Wix and Weebly , Weebly and Squarespace , and Weebly and WordPress- all these articles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all thanks to LTPs KC score . <p> We have repeated this process for many keywords on the Long Tail Pro blog ( and other sites we own ) . Also , by finding one low competition keyword , we 've taken inspiration for that keyword and also produced an article on Squarespace SEO- as well as the best alternatives to WordPress . <p> The real " kicker " though , is that the traffic to this Weebly SEO page is generating sales . We can track that we are indeed selling a few copies of Long Tail Pro to people that have Googled " Weebly SEO " , read our article , and then go on to buy the software . <p> Bottom line is that the Keyword Competitiveness score is something that we actively use in our business and it works . If you do n't  believe us , here 's another example the keyword profitable website ideas has KC 21 ( although its only a 40 search volume KW ) . We posted an article targeting that keyword and are ranking #5 . <p> This strategy should work with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tend to be popular as a starting point for a lot of people ) . <p> Again , many of you may not notice any changes with the new adjusted KC score in version 3.0. - However , overall , you can now be more confident than ever that the Keyword Competitiveness score is the most accurate keyword difficulty score around . <p> KC remains one of the main reasons why we think Long Tail Pro is a better tool than some other keyword tools like Ubersuggest and- other alternatives . <p> In addition , as Google changes ranking factors in the future ( which is of course going to happen ) , we will also adjust as needed the official KC calculation. - You can rest assured that the numbers you see in Long Tail Platinum are based on current data and not yesterdays best practices . All in all , were committed to making sure that Long Tail Pro is the best long tail keyword research software in the market . <h> 58 Comments <p> Tao on July 14 , 2015 at 10:35 am <p> Hah !

I use several tools to do keyword research but rely on longtailpro and moz.com for keyword competitiveness . <p> Earlier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keyword difficulty score . But now there seems to a very big difference by atleast 10 points between LTP and Moz ? <p> So , what Keyword competitive score must we rely on ? I know LTP is great , but your comments on this will help . <p> Can you expand on this a bit Spencer ? I do n't  mind that the tools come out with different numbers , but when I find a keyword that looks like a great opportunity in LTP but has average difficulty in Moz , I do n't  know what to do . <p> 1 . As you no longer use PBN links to rank your sites what type of links are you using to rank keywords that are medium competition in LTP ? <p> 2 . Are you having any luck ranking new websites easily with keywords from LTP that are considered low competition under 30 KC , sometimes keywords rank easily on sites such as Long Tail Pro and Niche Pursuits due to the sites authority . Are you getting the same results ranking on the first page of google with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and your team keep Long Tail Pro updated . I cant tell you how helpful this software has been for me over the past few years . I do n't  know what I would do without it . <p> Question you mention the it only uses the exact phrase when looking at the Top 10 . As you know , Google counts a lot of KWs the same these days . Ie , when you type " top rated product y " , Google will BOLD " best " because it knows that means top rated . <p> Recently , LTP v3.0 runs update regularly . So , can I know the reason ? I do n't  mind about these update . I just concern what change in new updates compare with before version . And there is one more thing . Can I sort by Search Volume like the way in v2.x.x ?

The term is used to describe unique content that attracts links mostly organically . Obviously , a big part of any content marketing is the marketing side but with good linkbait , the idea is to do some marketing upfront and hope that after the initial push , a piece of content wll start attracting links organically . <p> Linkbait can come in many shapes ; evergreen articles , killer infographics , lists , video , etc but regardless of the medium , what truly separates linkbait from the rest of the Internet clutter is its usefulness ( in most cases ) . - In rare cases , good linkbait can be created without the content being all that useful the two main ways to achieve this are egobait- and **27;30;TOOLONG . <p> In a nutshell , linkbait is content created with a specific purpose in mind , to attract links and to interest the linkerati " people who prowl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to while building lists , how to articles , or comprehensive resource pages . <p> When it comes to linkbait , people who throw you links are- doing it for their own purposes , but that is something you should n't concern yourself with . If the end result is that you 're getting high-quality links to your site then you have a sufficient enough reason to create exactly- the type of content that will get those links . <p> Links are the fuel for your SEO efforts and will help you get the organic search results you want . Getting unsolicited links is the best way to go about it ( although , they wo n't really be unsolicited " just like any other content marketing technique , link baiting often requires a fair bit marketing to succeed . <h> How to Approach Linkbaiting <p> A lot of content creators think that creating linkbait boils down to a good idea . Try it . Take a really awesome idea , create excellent content around it and set it loose on the world . It will fall flat as soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bait requires more than a sound idea . It requires a plan , an effective process that you can replicate time and again so your virality is n't some sort of a fluke or a one-off thing . <p> A great idea <p> This is a prerequisite of link bait content . When I say a great idea I do n't necessarily think anything revolutionary or new " just something done in a way that it was n't done before . <p> One of the building blocks on which this great idea stands on is keyword research . If you want people to share and link to your content , you have to make sure that there is demand for it . Using professional keyword tools such as LongTailPro will help you get an idea about what 's currently trending and what 's always popular . <p> Content that is constantly in demand is also called evergreen content and you should strive to make it a central part of your content strategy " people will consistently search for it once you create it all you need to do is regularly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Setting out to create a piece of content about something you have no idea about is painful but also necessary at times . After all , you have to write and create stuff that people need , as opposed to doing content that you 're comfortable with . <p> However , if you can not find the resources you need for this great piece it is most likely to end up as an exercise in futility . If there is nothing to be found on the internet then it might be a good idea to do some primary research . This will ensure that your content is completely unique and will establish you as a forerunner and a forward-thinker in your niche . <p> If you do n't have the time or the resources to do it properly , then abandon the idea . You will save yourself a lot of time , money , and effort and avoid creating sub-par content that does n't have any substance . <p> Top notch design <p> Some of the most linkable pieces of content out there are visual . Do you think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course not ! When you opt for creating an infographic or any other piece of visual content , make sure it 's exquisite . <p> What you say may even be sub-par , believe me , but if your data visualization is stellar people will link to it . This is because great visual content is much better at conveying information than walls of text are . Today , it 's all about making it easier for your audience . <p> Effective outreach plan <p> Remember how I said that link bait grows feet and finds people who are going to link to it all by itself ? Well , that was a bit of a lie . There is a fair bit of outreach efforts that go into getting those links , at least at the beginning . But you definitely have an advantage with linkbait content when compared to your run-of-mill stuff that you put out . <p> This type of content has to be of great quality . That way you wo n't have to twist anyone 's arm to link to it and people will gladly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if you enlist everyone who 's contributed to it it 's going to be easy to start a social media wildfire that will give you the initial exposure you need . <p> If your content is truly , really excellent things will pick up from there and you will not have to lift a finger to get links . If it does n't " well , I 'm sorry to break it to you but it was not really linkbait to begin with , though I 'm sure it was a good try ! <h> Types of Linkbait <p> Anything can be linkbait really " as long as the execution is perfect , it fulfills a need , and people find it useful then it has the potential of attracting a ton of links . <p> However , certain type of content really lends itself more to linkbaiting so let 's check out what you should be focusing your time and effort . <h> Ultimate Lists <p> Lists get a lot of exposure because they are useful . People love neatly organized stuff that has a little bow on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do it . Whatever your niche , chances are that lists are done to death and that people are constantly creating them . To get on top you need to really put in some effort . <p> Ultimate lists work great , especially if you took the time to curate whatever pops up in the organic search and add to it . One of the best ways to do it is to look through several lists , compile a list of your own , and then check comments to see what can be added to it that was n't previously mentioned . <p> Check out this list of ultimate marketing tools from QuickSprout . It 's over 500 links strong and people refer to it constantly because it 's regularly updated and relevant . Also , there are some tools here that you wo n't find anywhere else . <h> Evergreen Articles <p> There is some content that will always be popular , that will always be searched for , and that will always attract an audience and , consequentially , links . We call this type of content evergreen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of content that was created by SEOMoz on the subject of search ranking factors . It was built in collaboration with other contributors and it 's constantly updated and refreshed . So far it has managed to get linked to more than 17,000 times ! <p> And here 's why it 's successful " it harnesses the power of collaboration ! In addition to being a good , always-relevant article , it also has a lot of contributors . All of these contributors will make it their business to make sure that this piece of content gets the exposure it deserves . They will share it , they will link to it , and they will recommend it . You name it and they will do it " because they 're invested in it ! <h> Egobait <p> Which brings us nicely to egobait . People who collaborate on a piece of content together will band together to promote it . But what happens when you reference a lot of people in content you create ? <p> You 're niche , just like any other , has a lot of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to say . Most of them have huge social media following to boot ! If you 're savvy enough you can tastefully turn linkbait into egobait with no one being any wiser for it . <p> For example , you can create an Expert Round Up ' type of post where you take bits and pieces of what other people have to say about your industry and collect all of it under the same URL . <p> Influencers are vain creatures , same as everyone else and they also need social proof so most of them will jump at the opportunity to link to an article that mentions their name . Of course , the article has to be good and you have to notify them about it instead of just waiting for them to pick it up themselves . <p> A better approach to this would be to contact them in advance of creating content . Asking them for their expert opinion on one thing or another will ensure you 're creating a unique piece of content instead of just rehashing what they previously said . Also , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and when you send them the final copy of the article you actually ask for them to consider linking to it without it appearing as if you 're asking for a favor ! <h> How to and Tutorial Posts <p> Guides have always been popular linkbait material . If you can create something that will help someone master a new skill reasonably fast or if you have the know-how that no one else does then you can be confident in it attracting some link love . <p> Even this unimaginative guide was able to attract more than 1000 links ! As you can see , the content is nothing spectacular , the design leaves a lot to be desired too but what this guide has going for it is its simplicity and the fact that it 's written around a constantly hot topic . <h> Offering a Dissenting Voice ( Controversy Bait ) <p> Opinion posts do n't really attract all that much attention unless you 're already established in your niche . In that case , sounding out on a regular basis might attract some link love " especially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you do not have to be a megastar to get people to link to your opinion post " you just have to play the devil 's advocate . Grab a really hot topic in your niche , see in which direction the popular vote swings , and write up something that 's the complete- opposite . <p> Make sure you 're using arguments and facts and actually have a leg to stand on , though . Dissenting for the sake of dissent will get you nowhere but if you can demonstrate that your positions have merit then you can spark a lively discussion and get people to link to you . <p> This method will usually be even more effective if you pick an influencer in your niche and call them out directly . Do n't  be mean about it , or you 'll probably be ignored but if you provide strong arguments and constructive criticism and target someone who 's well known in the niche , its not uncommon to get a direct response ( and a link ) . <h> Contests <p> Giving away free stuff always worked . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for attracting links . Of course , all of this can be done over social media but if you can find a way to naturally link the whole thing back to a page you want to rank , you can get a ton of natural links . <p> Better yet , if that page happens to be your landing page you can rank it rather fast and then later on simply remove all the references to the contest and still have a ton of links pointing in your direction ! <h> Infographics <p> Last , but not the least , are infographics . Now , infographics rule the social media space and those who are superbly executed generate a ton of shares over Facebook , LinkedIn , Instagram , and everywhere else . <p> A clear visual representation of data is preferable to text because of the fact that most people are visual learners , meaning that they retain stuff that they can see . There is a little caveat here : a bad infographic will sooner hurt you than help you so make sure that the topic lends itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're doing . <p> Take a look at this infographic from Copyblogger " simple , clean , and with an inane topic but it generated over 200,000 social shares and was linked to fair number of times too . <p> If you want to create link bait that has the potential of going viral then focus on the types of content that do well doing just that . Above all else , make sure that your content is high-quality and that you keep it up to date and relevant ; build upon what you can find on the web and always strive to make it a best possible resource out there .

@@21641427 @1641427/ <h> Long Tail Pro Tutorial <p> As you start your Jimdo website , its important to have a content plan in mind . A critical piece of your content strategy is the ability to do effective keyword research . In short , keyword research is finding out what people in your niche/industry are searching in Google , and how often . Besides that , you also need to be able to analyze your competition for a given keyword so you do n't  waste time chasing down things that are overly competitive . <p> When you 're first starting out , our suggestion is that you focus primarily on low competition , long tail keywords for your content . These are topics that get searched relatively often , but are n't  completely saturated with high authority websites in the top 10 of Google. <h> 1 . Create a new project <p> Once you 've opened the software and signed into your Google account , click the yellow " + " sign in the top-left corner to add a new project . A project is simply a name for a group of similar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Add seed keywords to your project <p> Next click on the blue " Find Keywords " button and add several " seed keywords " to your project . Seed keywords are simply idea starters that Long Tail Pro will use to generate other related keyword ideas . <p> For instance , if my seed keyword in my food/recipe project was simply " recipes " then I 'd expect to see keywords such as " best crockpot recipes , " " vegan recipes , " etc . <p> Since you can work through an unlimited amount of keywords , try to be creative with the seed keywords that you start with . This will give you some interesting keyword ideas in return that you may not have thought of . <p> If you are struggling to think of relevant seed keywords , click here to- watch us work through an example . <h> 3 . Add filters and generate keywords <p> Once you 've added some seed keywords , you can click on the arrow to the left of the keyword to expand a couple of pre-filter options . In the image @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my " gluten free " seed keyword must include the word " gluten . " <p> Any keywords that do n't  have the word " gluten " will automatically be left out . <p> Once you 've set any filters on desired keywords , you can then move on to " Customize Data &amp; Pre-Filter " which is an expandable menu just above the " Generate Keywords &amp; Fetch Data " button . <p> This will allow you to filter based on search volume ( only show keywords searched at least X times per month ) , keyword length ( only keywords with at least 3 words ) , and the cost per click provided by Google Adwords. <h> 4 . Sort &amp; analyze your keywords <p> Once youve generated keywords , you 'll likely see hundreds or thousands of keyword ideas . On the left , you can view all keywords at once ( default ) or view just one seed keyword at a time . In my example Ive chosen to just look at my results for " gluten free . " <p> I can sort any column by clicking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sort to see the most frequently searched items first I can do that very quickly . <p> In my case , I started scanning the list and saw " is rice gluten free " as a keyword I wanted to analyze the competition for . I can already see that it gets searched 14,800 times per month , on average . So to analyze it further , I clicked on the keyword itself and was able to see an analysis of the top 10 results in Google . <p> In this case , - I see the average keyword competitiveness is 27 . This is a score assigned by our software to help you quickly determine how competitive a keyword is . While there are always other variables at hand , here is a quick breakdown of what the numbers represent : <p> Since 27 is low competition , I clicked on the " star " icon next to the keyword which added it to my favorites list . This way , I can continue finding other keywords I want to target and then sort through them all later in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have at least 10 solid keywords to target . <p> When you have your keywords finalized , the next step will be to create outstanding content focused on those keywords .

@@21641429 @1641429/ <h> Long Tail Pro Cloud Rollout Update <p> As you may have noticed , Long Tail Pro Cloud has gone live along with a snazzy new website homepage . Many of our existing users are wondering when they might get access to the Cloud version of the product and I know for a fact that a good number of people have been eagerly anticipating this updated version of LTP . <p> If you are a platinum monthly or annual subscriber , or you purchased a lifetime platinum membership in the past , the first thing we want to note is that you will get access to one of the LTP Cloud plans with no additional charge to your current plan . <p> We just started rolling out to platinum users yesterday we are doing so in batches of about 300 a day so that we do n't  overload our servers . Everyone should hopefully be migrated by about the end of next week provided we do n't  run into any server stability or slowdown issues . <p> For non platinum Long Tail Pro users who do n't  have access @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be available to you at a discounted rate . Long Tail Pro Cloud is equivalent to Long Tail Platinum , in that keyword competitiveness scores ( as well as a couple of other features ) are available to all users on the cloud platform . <p> If you 've seen the new homepage , you 'll notice that there is now a monthly keyword quota in Long Tail Pro Cloud . The reasoning behind this is were now paying for multiple third party data services ( e.g the replacement data providers for Google Keyword planner data ) , and there is an ongoing monthly cost of each additional user . However , we 'd like to note that this keyword quota only applies to the Cloud version , and any user who has access to the desktop version can continue using it. - Also , we believe that the monthly keyword quotas are quite generous and most users are unlikely to run out of keywords . <p> On a somewhat related note , we realize that we have not communicated with our users as frequently as maybe we should have been . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been on getting the Cloud tool to the point where we feel it is stable and reliable enough to release to users , which has unfortunately led to a little bit of oversight on the communication side with some of our users . We apologize for this , and were actually working on bringing in a new community manager to address this issue . Hopefully this post clears up most of the lingering questions about our plans for LTP Cloud . <p> Here are some answers to common questions that users had : <p> Q : Why was n't the Cloud version given to existing subscribers first ? A : There are about 2000 active users of the existing Air application . This is a LOT of people to bring onto a new infrastructure all at once . In order to provide the best service and reliability to everyone , we chose to release the app to new signups first so that we could watch the system very carefully , fix any problems quickly , and provide the best experience to everyone when we send out your new accounts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be a good- one . <p> Q : When will accounts be sent out to existing subscribers ? A : We started rolling out accounts to existing users yesterday . We wanted to start sending them earlier , but were delayed by about two weeks while we waited on an external service provider to approve our usage increases . If all goes smoothly , existing platinum users should all have cloud accounts by the end of next week . <p> Q : How much will the new application cost ? Will you have to pay an additional subscription cost ? A : For existing monthly or annual subscribers , there will be no additional cost . You will be subscribed to Long Tail Pro Cloud as a bonus in addition to continued access to the Air tool . <p> Q : What about Platinum Lifetime users ? A : Platinum Lifetime users will also get access to Long Tail Pro Cloud at no additional cost . <p> Q : What about non-Platinum Long Tail Pro users ? A : LTP users who are not lifetime platinum , monthly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cloud version of the tool . We will however provide exclusive discounts to all existing non-platinum users , and non-platinum users can of course continue using the desktop version of the tool . For users who are running into the ranged volume issue with Google Keyword Planner , here is a potential solution to overcome this issue . <p> Q : Why are there keyword limits ? A : The web application is more expensive to operate . For one thing , there 's a lot more infrastructure to support , as well as the API subscriptions for services such as Majestic and a new service to provide accurate keyword volume so we can avoid the Google Keyword Planner account restrictions . Relying on external services rather than Ad Hoc user accounts makes the product more stable and reliable , but the costs associated with it are often usage based . We need a way to reliably estimate usage , so unlimited keywords simply are n't  feasible . We 've already doubled- the keyword limits on each of the new plans for LTP Cloud , and based on our own usage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and should not be an issue at all for the vast majority of our users .

This is especially true if you own an Amazon Affiliate site and you 've run out of best X keywords to try and rank for . <p> If you 've felt the same way , then please read on . <p> Were going to cover 7 different ideas to both find more creative seed keywords for your Long Tail Pro projects , and find lists of keywords that you can copy/paste into Long Tail Platinum for further analysis . <p> sunoteTry it for free : - To search for low competition keywords in your niche with Long Tail Pro , Click Here /sunote <h> 1 . Soovle Your Ideas <p> Its been around for awhile , but is still a time-saving- way to discover some keywords that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by typing in a keyword and Soovle will instantly pull back the suggested searches from each one of these sites . As you can imagine , the searches someone does most often on Amazon for a topic may be very different than what people search on Youtube . <p> So Soovle gives you a nice mix of ideas . <p> When you type in a word or phrase , you 'll get results that look like this : <p> From there , you can copy/paste those results into the " Add My- Own Keywords " box of Long Tail Platinum : <p> After you fetch the data , you can then sort based on the monthly search volume and calculate the competitiveness of any keywords you are interested in . <p> In the video below , I show the whole process using " how to play drums " as an example : <h> 2 . See What Your Competitors Rank For <p> How helpful would it be to know exactly what your competitors are ranking for in the search engines ? <p> More than likely , your competition is ranking for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you knew what those keywords were . <p> SEMRush is a robust SEO Tool , and it is one we use for our businesses . One of the most helpful things you can do is find out exactly who your competitors are , and then get a list of all the search terms they rank in the top 20 for . <p> 1 . Input your site , or a competing site in to the main search bar and then click on " overview " <p> 2 . Scroll down and view a list of the main competitors. - <p> 3. - Look for- small to medium-sized sites and click on the URL to pull up that site in SEMRush . <p> The idea- here is to start with less authoritative sites that are ranking for a bunch of keywords in your niche. - The fact that they are able to rank well for certain terms is a good sign for you since they are a small to medium-sized brand like you . By starting with sites of similar size and authority to you , - you 'll find some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ currently rank for . <p> 4 . Pull up the list of keywords they rank for . <p> Click on " Organic Research " and then click on " Positions " to pull up this list . <p> Once you click " Positions " you 'll see this : <p> By default , SEMRush sorts the keywords by the percentage of organic traffic they deliver for that site . So the keywords that bring them the most traffic are listed first . <p> 5 . Analyze Keywords in Long Tail Pro- <p> The final step is to take any keywords you are interested in , meaning they are a good fit for your site , and drop those into Long Tail Pros " quick analyze " field and see what the competition looks like overall . <p> In the example above , " best rifle for deer hunting " gets 720 searches per month and stood out as a keyword of interest . After checking it in Long Tail Platinum , I find that it is something I should be able to compete for : <p> You can follow this strategy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ create content for . <h> 3. - Niche Forums <p> They may look a bit out of date , but seemingly every niche has at least one forum that is full of active , engaged enthusiasts on your topic . <p> Needless to say , these are exactly the kinds of people you want visiting your site and becoming your subscribers , customers , etc . <p> Checking forums helps you understand the questions they have and the lingo they use . <p> In turn , these can be fantastic seed keyword ideas to use in Long Tail Pro . <p> The simplest way to find forums in your industry is to go to Google and search " keyword + forum . " <p> I used my earlier example about playing drums and look what I found : <p> At least 4 solid forums that are exclusively aimed at drummers . <p> I clicked on the first one and then jumped into their drumming technique forum where I found a bunch of topics like this : <p> Now I 'm not a drummer and I know very little about the topic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few things that I might use as seed keywords : <p> Hi Hat Beats <p> Drum Practice Routine <p> Drumming Practice Techniques <p> Brush Technique <p> Dave Grohl <p> Obviously if you really were a drumming expert , you could do a much better job of scrolling through this list and picking out relevant keyword ideas . Once you have 5 10 , drop them into Long Tail Pro as seed keywords and see what you get : <p> This gave me over 1,700 ideas , including some low competition gems like " how to practice drums " with a KC of 23 : <h> 4 . Amazon Kindle Book Titles <p> Like with forums , there are Kindle ebooks available on virtually any topic you can think of . At the time of this writing , there are over 3.7M Kindle books listed on Amazon . <p> Kindle books are also another free way to find keyword ideas for your website . <p> To do this , simply go over to Amazons Kindle Store and search for your topic or keyword. - I typed in " drumming " to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on page 1 ( of 11 pages ) . <p> Clearly you can do this again and again with similar and related keywords , recording any seed keyword ideas that you discover . <h> 5. - Mass Import Google Suggestions <p> Similar to Soovle , Ubersuggest takes your keyword and then provides other suggestions using that keyword . In this case , it uses Googles suggestions to take your keyword and then add on every letter of the alphabet , giving you hundreds of suggestions . Click here to get more creative ideas on how to use Ubersuggest . <p> Below is what Ubersuggest looks like when I type in " beard . " <p> After running the suggestions , simply highlight all the keywords on the page and copy/paste them into Long Tail Platinum to get the search volume data and run your competitive analysis . <p> In one of our Long Tail Pro demo videos , I show exactly how to get suggestions and add them to Long Tail Platinum : <h> 6 . Related Searches For Seed Keywords <p> Besides the Google instant suggestions , you 'll also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bottom of your search results . <p> Here are my related searches when I pop- " drumming " into Google : <p> You might think that all of these related searches would be automatically included when you use " drumming " as a seed keyword . <p> However , that is n't necessarily the case . <p> I added drumming as a seed keyword and got 653 ideas , but " history of drumming " and " drumming song lyrics " werent part of those results . <p> So I could take those 2 keywords and enter them as seed keywords , if they were relevant enough to my site . I ended up doing just that , and I got an additional 561 keyword ideas . <h> 7 . Focus on Problems <p> I first heard about this idea listening to Marcus Sheridan , who was involved in a small pool company struggling to stay afloat . They used content marketing and blogging to- almost single-handedly turn around the companys fortunes by bringing in new leads and customers . <p> One thing he mentions is that they tackled " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problems with fiberglass pools ? " <p> Despite the fact that they sold fiberglass pools , they saw the value in acknowledging that they werent perfect because it was an opportunity to build trust with their audience . <p> To this day , River Pools and Spas holds the number 1 spot in Google when you search " problems with fiberglass pools . " <p> Marcus reported that- this page generated millions of dollars in sales for their business over the years . <p> Think about how this strategy could apply to your business or website . <p> The guy searching for problems or complaints probably wants to know if the good outweighs the bad . If not , he s still looking to buy so hed likely be open to your suggestion about a model that is higher quality and more reliable . <p> How can you use problems to find keyword ideas ? <p> 1 . If you- run a business like Marcus did with the pool company , you probably get these questions all the time anyway . If you do n't  personally , ask your sales @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this category . <p> Once you have some real questions from your customers , simply answer them in a blog post . <p> Even if the keyword research data ( like the monthly search volume ) isnt- that great go ahead and answer it anyway . <p> The odds are that if people ask you directly , many more people are asking a similar question in Google . By answering the question on your website , you demonstrate your authority on the topic and you help build trust by showing that you can be honest about the products you sell . <p> Do n't  be afraid to answer these kinds of questions head on , as it gives you an opportunity to own the conversation with your readers and your audience . If you do n't  answer their questions , someone else will and it may cost you a customer . <p> 2. - If you are n't  in a business or position where you would get these questions directly and need some ideas , use tools like Long Tail Pro , Soovle , and Ubersuggest to drop in words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keywords , brand names , product types , etc. and get a bunch of ideas for what people are actually searching . <p> Its easy to overlook these and only- look for positive modifiers like " Best " , " Top " , etc . <p> When you compile a list of suggestions , go through the competitive analysis process and look for those keywords that fit your content , and ideally have low enough competition that you can compete . <p> As stated in #1 , not every keyword needs to be low competition to focus on it for your blog . If you find an industry problem that you feel like you should talk about- go ahead and do it . If your human audience would get value from it forget the keyword metrics and go for it . <p> You can promote that content on your social media channels , to your email list , and through email outreach to other influencers in the industry to help get eyeballs on your content . <h> Wrap Up <p> Hopefully some of these- ideas are new to you and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for your business . <p> Do you have any other methods for finding keyword ideas ? <p> If so , please share in the comments below : <h> 14 Comments <p> It is a very informative post , soovle was the one which i was missing until now for my service at http : **27;87;TOOLONG , thanks for coming up with helpful articles which will help us use longtailpro better . <p> Please note that Google is pulling the plug on their Autocomplete API 5 days from now on 10th August 2015 . This means that some of your favorite tools like Ubersuggest and Yoasts Suggest tool may become unavailable unless they implement an alternative way of obtaining the suggest results . <p> May I suggest both Suggarraes and Supremacy SEOs newsletters ? They currently both do weekly newsletters with bite sized information . I 've found them to be very helpful for staying up to date with the most important SEO news and tips . <p> I was wondering about updates to the methods in this post as it was from 2015 and as we know in seo and world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times . <p> I always believed that ubersuggest simply added letters and words in front of and after our inputted phrase simply working through the alphabet and using common words both before and after our keyword or keyphrase , rather than pulling specific and accurate phrases from search engines using apis ? <p> Would be good to know the actual answer to this and also if anyone knows of more helpful tools online that have come about since this post was published . Free tools obviously <p> Speaking of which , is Semrush free to use for competition analysis to find competitors keyword ideas as mentioned here on this blog ?

Here is some more information on how to find success with marketing infographics . <p> To be honest , Fiverr probably is n't the best place to get an infographic done. - A more typical price for an infographic design is anywhere from several hundred dollars up to over a thousand dollars . There are a number of variables that can affect the cost , such as the number of data points they need to design . <p> All that said , if you 've got big plans for your infographic I 'd recommend investing more money at a place like 99Designs where you 'll get a bunch of options for a reasonable price . <p> If you do want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used that can get you a fairly simple design ( up to 4 points ) for only $5 . There are add-ons as well , so you can pay more to get additional content . Here is sample from his gigs on Fiverr : <h> E-Book Covers <p> 7 . Youve probably seen where people offer a free e-book if you sign up for their email list , and the image of the book makes it look like it is a real , hardback book that you could find at Barnes &amp; Noble . You can get the same kind of professional design done on Fiverr . <p> Maybe you offer a free market report or a guide to something that your audience is interested in , check out this gig on Fiverr to make your- pdf look like a real book .

@@21641447 @1641447/ <h> SEO Infographics : Using Infographics to Link Build for Fun and Profit <h> Why Infographics should be a Part of your SEO Toolbox <p> When the infographic entered the game several years ago it was an instant home run . Content marketers who adapted quickly reaped enormous benefits in terms of exposure and social media shares . <p> But even those who did not immediately jump on the bandwagon came to their senses soon enough . Infographics proved to be such a powerful tool for marketing ideas and getting shares that no one could afford to give them the stink eye . <h> So what are infographics and why are they effective ? <p> First thing 's first : infographics are a visual representation of data ( sometimes complex data , sometimes simple data " but data nonetheless ) and as such they are more capable of getting etched into peoples ' minds . <p> Humans are a peculiar species ; most of our communication is completely non-verbal . In fact , content marketers claim that videos are their best ROI content . This is n't all that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ type of content is none other than video . <p> But infographics are coming are crushing it when it comes to social media shares and likes . It 's estimated that they do almost 3X times better than any other content when it comes to sharing . <p> This is because : <p> 90% of information we absorb is visual <p> We absorb that visual information nearly 60,000 X FASTER than info from any other stimuli <p> 40% of people are purely visual learners " they remember what they see <p> You really do n't have to take my word for it , though . Below is an infographic- explaining why infographics get the attention they do . Extremely Meta " but very useful , too ! <p> One last startling fact for the unbelievers amongst you " in 2014 there were actually 5 different infographics that broke 100,000 in shares across different social media channels . If that does n't convince you of how useful they really are I do n't know what will . <p> 6 Ways Infographics Boost Your SEO Efforts <p> One of the world 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most shared pieces of content are regularly infographics . This became so prevalent that he rarely ever publishes anything that is n't graphic-rich . <p> According to Neil : ( Infographics ) are generating more backlinks than any other type of content I publish ' " and herein lies the secret on why they help your rock search engine optimization . Infographics are easily shareable and if you endeavor to make them interesting enough they will do all the legwork for you " provided you market them effectively . <p> There are just some of the benefits of infographics that will aid your SEO efforts : <p> Embedded links <p> The code for an infographic is provided as an embed code . This means that whenever someone shares or links your infographic they will create a link to your original page . As Patel said , there is no way that is more effective in creating backlinks than a well thought out infographic . <p> Attractive and interesting <p> Infographics are by far more digestible than pages of boring written content . Break down your content into interesting facts and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will create something that will appeal to a greater percentage of your target audience . <p> Viral component <p> Infographics are hot and those executed well enough have the potential of going viral . Just one on-the-mark infographic can translate into thousands of shares and tens of thousands of visits to your page . If only a fraction of those visitors can be turned into customers you stand a lot to gain . <p> Creates brand awareness <p> All infographics are stamped with your company 's logo , as well as ( preferably ) executed in your company colors . If they 're not , then you 're doing it wrong . Make sure that every single graphic you publish has your company 's logo featured prominently on it . <p> Establishes you as a thought leader <p> This is not an inherent treat of infographics " you wo n't be branded a thought leader just because you made one infographic on a particular subject . But if you manage to make one that is good enough to gain some traction and social shares and create exposure and visibility for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ definitely regard you as an expert on the topic . <p> Mobile-friendly <p> Most infographics are created with mobile searchers on mind . Considering that they are now the bulk of internet users it would be extremely foolish not to do so . In that respect , they are good for SEO because mobile users will not punish you by leaving your page immediately ( like they will when they notice a wall of text on there ) and Google will not take that as a negative signal and reduce your score . <p> As you can see , there are a lot of ways marketers can benefit from creating outstanding graphics , especially those who are concerned with building natural backlinks and , in general , SEO . Infographics , however , ca n't be left to their own devices once created . You will have to give them a little push in order to get them going . Once you do get everything right , you will be reaping benefits months after you 've published one . <h> Marketing Infographics for Traffic and Links <p> There is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so I wo n't really list them all here . What I will do is give you a breakdown of tactics you should definitely employ for every one of the infographics you decide to put out there . <p> Social media announcement and schedule <p> For the love of God , do n't create an infographic , post it on your blog and hope for people to pick it up from there . Create a social media announcement across all your platforms and let people know you have an exciting new piece of content for them ! <p> Remember that infographics get a bulk of social media likes and shares ? That is because people find them easy to share with friends " something that wo n't be true if you do n't have it published on social media networks ! <p> Schedule a series of posts and tweets and use everything you have at your disposal : Facebook , Twitter , Pinterest , Flickr , Tumblr , everything . The best way to go about it is to take little snippets of content from your infographic and tease the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ facts you have there to spark their interest and get them to read more . <p> Submit a press release <p> There are a lot of publications out there on the Web that cater to a bunch of different industries . Find the ones that are closely linked to what your infographic is about and contact the editor to see if you can submit a press release . <p> This approach is great for a number of reasons but predominantly because you will be getting through to your target audience much quicker than without it . Also , this alone will create a healthy number of backlinks to your graphic , which can only be beneficial to your SEO . <p> Make sure you optimize your press release for the keywords you 're targeting and contact only relevant sites and publications . Do n't push your work to editors who are not catering to your audience just because they get a ton of monthly visits . <p> Get your work submitted to directories <p> There is a whole bunch of great sites and directories that would be more than willing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It does n't really cost them anything and it 's an easy way to add some extra content to their sites . <p> Try the following if you 're stumped for ideas but remember that there are a lot of others out there that you can ferret out with a bit of investigative work . <p> Manual outreach can be a tedious little task but there or ways to short-cut it and still profit immensely from it . Did you reference an influencer when creating your infographic ? Or did you maybe source your information from relevant blogs ? <p> Make sure to contact those influencers and blogs and let them know that they are featured in your piece of content . Most of them will give you the time of day " especially if you did a good job " and will share your infographic with their audience . <p> An even better idea is to contact those influencers and have them chip in before you create and publish . That way you will have some original thought weaved through your content but also onboard those influencers and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to their audience . <h> What Makes a Great Infographic ? <p> I know , I know " this was a really roundabout way to getting to the point but I wanted you to understand why infographics work , how they can help your SEO efforts , and what you need to do to get them to go viral before I chimed in with my two-cents on what makes a great infographics . So here it is : <p> Make sure there 's a market for them <p> A lot of content creation is focused on pure fluff and filler and there really is n't any reason why you should be adding to the junk that slowly taking over the Internet . <p> Do your research and find out what people are actually looking for , what they are interested , and make an infographic focused around that . Tools such as Ubersuggest or LongTailPro will go a long way in making sure that you 're not missing your mark completely . <p> Do your own doodling <p> Or get a designer to do it for you . A lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recently I saw an interesting infographic that looked exactly like the one I did months ago ! Of course , I did n't hold it against the guys because it was interesting but still . <p> The point is : with custom graphics you can do a lot more . You can get icons and images that reflect your company colors and you can tailor your fonts to mimic those on your page " essentially , you can put your stamp on that graphic and use it to build additional brand awareness , killing two birds with one stone . <p> Facts , facts , and some more facts <p> A lot of marketers forget that the graphics are there to help people understand numbers and concepts more easily " do n't make the same mistake . Use only credible sources and if you ca n't double check something then it does n't really belong in your infographic . <p> The inverted pyramid <p> Take a cue from how newspapers and magazines format their pages . They use something called the inverted pyramid approach . <p> Make a bold statement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're sure will catch people 's eye and make them read more about it . After you get them hooked it 's all about providing sufficient evidence in the form of data that supports your claim . <p> Use the bottom of the graphic for your pitch , logo , contact information , and sources . They should n't go on top " unless they are the most interesting part of your graphic . If that 's the case then you really should n't be making one in the first place . <h> Should I Pay for it or Do it Myself ? <p> Well , this is a bit of a biggie , I suppose . Personally , I would always pay to get a great infographic made " especially if it is from a designer I trust and think highly of . But this will be determined by your budget . Great infographics can cost up to a couple of thousands of dollars and you still have to do all the research and provide the designer with content . However , if you manage to partner up a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get a ton of traction and exposure . <p> If you want to dabble with creating one yourself " and why should n't you " then I can recommend the following online tools that I 've found most helpful in the past . <p> Canva " - This is probably our favorite image tool for creating infographics . Its super easy to use , and the templates that they provide can make things go 5x faster than they normally would . Canva is totally free , and it only costs money if you want to use the stock photos/images that they have. - There are more than enough free options available in Canva if you do n't  want to , you 'll never have to pay a cent.The really great thing about Canva is that you can make stuff that looks great without really having a good eye for the design the templates they provide are all pretty great , and its just a matter of switching out the default text for whatever you want your infographic to say . <p> Piktochart " definitely the most popular graphics-creation tool on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be stuck with their logo " and you really want your logo featured on your infographic.A monthly subscription is relatively affordable " around $ 27 " and gives you access to more templates . Also , you will be able to add info-boxes , charts , graphs and more.Keep in mind that Piktochart is not the easiest tool to master and that there is definitely a learning curve to it . Do n't expect your first infographic to turn out great but if you keep at it , you will soon create stuff that is good enough to publish . <p> Easelly " this is a great tool that is also extremely affordable , to boot ! For only $ 3 a month you will get access to thousands of free images , more than 60 fonts , and professionally designed templates that just might push you over the top and help you create a killer graphic. - Also , it 's very easy to use , plus you will have an excellent support system and access to a designer that is more than willing to help you figure out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " like Piktochart , Infogram has a free version that you can use but it 's not extremely useful as it only allows you to download your infographic in a PNG format. - However , you can subscribe for a month and pay $ 25 to get access to a lot more images , fonts , and icons . The reason why I really like this tool is because it is a lot more intuitive than Piktochart so if you 're not on the market for some extra features , this is the one I would definitely recommend . <p> Infographics should be one of the tools from your content marketing toolbox that you go back to time and time again . A good infographic paired with the right marketing can give your business- a ton of visitors from social shares and referrals and they can also net you hundreds ( if not thousands ) of links . <p> TImely post for me because I fiddled with infographics about a year ago and came up with what I now realize was a very complicated design and then struggled getting them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just simplifying my design approach and using my social media outlets as you suggest ( did n't  have those in place last time either ) will make a world of difference . <p> Before , I just only thing that we only SEO via keywords analytics by LTPro , but after reading this article , I learn more one thing for SEO , that is using infographics . Maybe you are right , infographics are more attractive than keywords , so in my mind , the readers will love infographics that keywords . 
@@21641448 @1641448/ <h> Squarespace SEO How To Rank Your Squarespace Website <p> You may have heard that Squarespace is " bad for SEO , " but is there any truth to that ? <p> For those who are n't  familiar with Squarespace , it is a website creation tool that is designed to make beautiful looking websites very simple to do , for those without any special design skills or experience . <p> This post is n't a review or an endorsement of Squarespace , but rather an attempt to- show that you absolutely can do well in the search engines with a Squarespace site and show you exactly how you can do it . <p> Shall we begin ? <h> Squarespace SEO : The- Reality <p> When I think of search engine optimization ( SEO ) I think in the context of organic , search engine traffic . In other words , how well is my site doing in the search engines as far as ranking for the keywords I want to rank for , etc . <p> In simple terms , optimizing your website for the search engines is about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do a good job of on-page SEO- and create content that is relevant and high quality . Second , you need to do good " off-page " SEO by doing things like getting high quality websites to link back to you . <p> This process helps search engines understand what your site is about , know that it is high quality content , and demonstrates that other authoritative sites vouch for you by linking back to you . <p> While that is a high level overview of SEO , the question is " can one do those things while using Squarespace ? " <p> For the answer , I think we should explore 2 things : <p> 1 . What do experts and people who know way more than me think about it ? - <p> 2 . What kind of proof is there for Squarespace sites doing well in search ? - <p> For the first one , Squarespace gets a pretty big endorsement from the Wizard of Moz himself , Rand Fishkin . He said the following in a discussion thread : <p> Since Rand has forgotten more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ word pretty seriously . Why would he take the time to comment on a discussion about Squarespace SEO unless he felt strongly about it . <p> More important than what Rand Fishkin or anybody else has to say are- the actual results . <p> I read with great interest a post from Elle and Company Design about their experience with Squarespace . They talked about some of the basics of SEO , but then shared their own traffic numbers , showing that they had grown by over 500% in a 4 month period using Squarespace . Here is the image they used to show the traffic trend : <p> They concluded by saying " Its a fair assessment that Squarespaces SEO capabilities have not slowed down Elle and Companys traffic . " <p> I think that 's very fair to say . <h> SEO Isnt A Magic Pill <p> Giving just one example of a company who is using Squarespace and seeing organic traffic skyrocket helps prove just one small thing : <p> You can do well in the search engines with a Squarespace website . <p> Notice that I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " most people do well . " - However , having a Squarespace site that ranks well in Google is certainly possible . The key thing to understand is that there is no " magic pill " when it comes to SEO . <p> Nobody can just sprinkle some SEO dust on your website and make you rank well in Google . <p> So if your website is n't very good on WordPress , moving it to Squarespace is n't going to suddenly open the traffic floodgates . The opposite is also true . If you have a Squarespace site that gets no search engine traffic , simply moving it over to WordPress is n't going to fix the problem even if WordPress is " better for SEO . " <p> No , it takes some work and some know how no matter which website builder or content management platform you are using . <p> here 's how you can do effective SEO with Squarespace : <h> Cover Your Bases <p> Remember that Google ranks specific pages , and not websites . <p> I 've used the example before about a personal baseball website of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greatest baseball website in the world , but if I do n't  have a page that is on the topic of Fenway Park , then I 'm not going to rank well for searches people do about that stadium . <p> Instead , sites that have a page devoted to the ins and outs of Fenway Park will be ranking for that term because their page is a better match than anything I have to offer , even if my site overall is much better . <p> I think its important to understand this basic point so you can apply it to your own business . <p> While it would be great to have your home page ranking well for all the different search terms you covet , it makes a lot of sense to use your blog and other pages on your site to focus on specific keywords that youd also like to rank for . ( More on this later ) . <p> In Squarespace , you can easily make sure that each page is targeted and focused on whatever keyword you are trying to rank for by clicking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The page title and page description are critical parts of on-page- SEO . <p> Also further down on the page configuration for Squarespace is the ability to change the URL slug of your page : <p> This can also be useful for both SEO and for your human visitors . For instance , if you are a wedding photographer in Miami and put together a page about the most scenic wedding venues in the area , your Squarespace configuration might look like this : <p> Then my URL slug would just be " Miami-wedding-venues " to make things simple . <p> Therefore , - instead of a URL that looks like LONG ... <p> I can just have " **39;116;TOOLONG " <p> Much simpler , right ? <p> So assuming that this page is designed to rank for the keyword " Miami Wedding Venues " or " Wedding Venues in Miami , " - I 'm off to a pretty good start . <p> I 've used that keyword in my page title , page description , and as a bonus I 've got it as part of my URL . Best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and pleasing to a human visitor not some keyword-stuffed nonsense- like this : <p> See the difference ? <p> Making sure that every page you build has a well thought out title , description , and URL will put you ahead of the game . Once you 've done that , make sure that as you add images to your posts or pages , that you use Alt text to further demonstrate what your page is about to the search engines . <p> Now that we 've talked about how you can set up your Squarespace SEO on a page by page basis , you may be wondering how you can know what to target with your content . <p> I used " Miami wedding venues " as an example keyword to focus on , but how do you know which keywords are best for your business ? <h> The Importance of Keywords <p> Keywords matter whether you are using Squarespace , WordPress , or any other website builder . <p> A " keyword " simply means something that gets searched in Google ( or another search engine ) . Keyword research @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ industry are searching for , and analyzing the competition so you can know which keywords you should be targeting . <p> If you do n't  know which keywords to target , you 'll be limited with the kind of SEO you can do in Squarespace . <p> After all , how will you know what your page titles , descriptions , and content should be optimized for ? <p> Blindly guessing is n't a smart strategy . <p> Its better to know how often a given phrase like " Miami wedding venues " is searched in a month , and perhaps more importantly to understand how fierce the competition is in the top 10 results of Google for that search term . <p> After all , if you are targeting things that are too generic and too competitive then your on-page SEO likely wo n't matter much . <p> My suggestion is that you look for keywords in your industry that get decent search volume , and also have relatively low competition . By targeting these long tail keywords , - you 'll have a better chance to rank well in Google because you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for . <h> SEO For Squarespace Blog Posts <p> At the time of this writing , Squarespace does n't  do as good of a job on opening up your SEO options on blog posts . <p> Specifically , there is no meta description- field that you can type in yourself . - The image below comes from HubSpot who said the following about meta descriptions : " In case you 're unfamiliar with the term , a meta description is the snippet of information below the link of a search result . Its purpose is to describe the contents of the page to the searcher . The end goal is to convince and persuade the searcher to click through to your website . Any words that match the search term are bolded in the description . <p> The image below shows you the basic anatomy of a search result , including where the meta description fits in . " <p> The point of HubSpots article , which I completely agree with , is that when you can specify a meta description you are really getting an opportunity to " sell " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ besides ranking in the search engines you also want them to click on your page when they see it in Google . So a compelling description can help make that happen . <p> What happens when you do n't  specify a meta description ? - Again , Hubspot did a good job explaining this : " Should you fail to put in a meta description for the pages you want to rank for , Google will display a snippet of text from the first paragraph of your page . If there 's a search keyword in that text , itll be bolded . Why is this bad ? Well , it means you 'll miss out on being able to sell to your prospective buyers . Now what salesperson would miss out on that opportunity ? " <p> Its pretty common to have access to the meta description field on blog posts in Squarespace competitors like Weebly and obviously WordPress , so maybe theyll add it at some point . For now , I do n't  think its a deal breaker for most people but something to be aware of if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ website . By the way , if you 're still deciding between platforms , we have you covered we have comparison posts about Wix vs Weebly , Weebly vs Squarespace , and Weebly vs WordPress . <p> So what SEO can you do on Squarespace blog posts ? <p> Even though you do n't  have a meta description field to work with , you do have control over other important factors . Obviously , you can set the post title which should absolutely include your keyword ( assuming you are focused on a specific keyword with your post ) . In the image below , I 've set my blog post title to " How To Build A Shelf DIY Project . " <p> Next , you can click on " options " in the top-right corner and have control over your URL . Notice below how the standard URL came out when I did n't  specify anything . Ugly , right ? <p> You should take a moment and change that URL to be more search engine and human friendly . If you 're doing a keyword focused post , see if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the keyword in your URL- this helps indicate what your blog post is about . <p> Does n't  a URL ending in " how-to-build-a-shelf " carry more meaning to you and to Google than one ending in " **30;157;TOOLONG " ? <p> I 'd also add the excerpt , which is what someone would see on your main blog page before clicking on " Read More " to see your full post . Finally , I 'd always specify a thumbnail image so my blog post looks its best . <p> Heres what I 'm left with after making these quick changes : <h> Wrap Up <p> Is Squarespace the best platform for SEO ? <p> No . <p> However , there is quite a bit you can do as we 've covered above . Also , focusing on the right long tail keywords has nothing to do with Squarespace and is half the battle . You could do the best on-page SEO in the world , but if you are targeting keywords that are way too competitive you probably wont rank well for those terms either way . <p> My final point is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to work with and it is working well for your business then stick with it . Go back and make sure you are " covering the bases " that I listed above , and make that part of your process moving forward . <p> Make sure you weigh the cost of your time and effort for moving your website to a different platform against the benefits of moving . As mentioned , following the right content strategy- for your Squarespace site will leave you in a strong position , and ahead of many of your competitors . <p> Best of luck ! <p> If you 're a Squarespace user and have any Squarespace SEO Tips to share , please do so below ! <p> I built a couple of sites about 6 months ago on Squarespace and while one is struggling , one has really taken off and its hoovering up all sorts of organic search traffic . Time on site is really high because its full of content that visitors are looking for and its displayed beautifully ( if I say so myself ! ) In the end , Squarespace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that 's only going to help your SEO if you marry it with great content . <p> I think its also easier to get links if you direct someone to a site that looks amazing . <p> I 'm using wordpress self hosted for more than 5 years , and this is the best CMS for me , my website is heavy graphics , because I 'm graphic designer , so I 'm playing with tons of images . Each post I only have 300 characters , but I always on first page on google search global . The SEO is very good . <p> Now I want to create a new blog and do n't  want to think about security , so my option is between wordpress.com and squarespace . The problem is in my life , I 've never see squarespace blog at google search , but I saw tons of wordpress.com blog . Where are those squarespace websites ? <p> I like squarespace because the template is clean and their TOS is flexible , we can put banner ads and affiliate link , not like wordpress.com which our website will end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ using squarespace that works well in term of SEO ? I 'm really curious , as a reference .

Culpepper Place is a senior living facility with just 2 locations in Tennessee .

The team behind LTP is actively trying to figure out a solution . <p> Also , please note that this workaround is a bit technical and might not be suitable for all users . We do n't recommend that you use this solution unless you 're having severe issues with recurring captchas . <p> This solution works by using an external program to tunnel your web traffic through proxies when using LTP .

Because vision problems tend to occur more frequently later in life , an aging population will require more optometrists . " <p> However , an aging population does n't  mean that optometrists are guaranteed a growing , profitable business . <p> One of the biggest challenges according to Bains report on the future of independent optometry , there- is the increasing pressure on the retail side , with more and more contacts and glasses being bought online and not directly from the optometrist . <p> So while folks may still come into the office for an exam , - they are far less likely than they once were to purchase their contacts or glasses on the same visit . <p> In addition to the increased competition for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in new clients and retain them while your competitors are hoping to do the same thing . <p> So how can you overcome one or both of these obstacles ? - <p> There is n't a magic bullet , but here are 3 very practical marketing ideas for optometrists that you should consider . <h> 1. - Do The Basics Online <p> Let 's tackle an essential first your online presence . <p> At this point , your business first impression usually happens online . <p> How many new clients simply wander into your office not knowing anything about you ahead of time ? <p> My guess is very few . <p> In fact , even if they were referred to you by a friend , they probably went online and looked you up first to learn more about you , see pictures of your office , find insurance details , or even read other reviews beyond what they heard from their friend . <p> If you 've spent no time doing the basics online , who knows what these people are finding ! <p> The First Step <p> First off you absolutely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so when people are looking for you online , they can find you and you make a strong first impression . Well talk about taking your websites marketing to another level in the next section . <p> Assuming you have a website that exists , then the first step is to make sure that at the very least youve claimed your spot as a Google Business . <p> The result is that when people look for your business on Google , - or when they are searching more generic things like " optometrists in YOUR CITY " you 'll have a better looking , more complete profile in Google like you see below : <p> In addition to having accurate and complete information about your bakery , you can also do things like : <p> Respond on behalf of your business to reviews left on Google . <p> Add nice looking photos of your office- that will show up in Googles listing <p> Add accurate hours and location information <p> Put your phone number and other contact info that people need to know . <p> Obviously Google is- the top dog @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least a dozen large directories , search engines , review sites , etc. that you should be completing your profile on mostly for the same reasons I mentioned about Google . <p> Most let you claim a business for free , but may also offer some paid services which you are n't  obligated to buy . <p> If you- take an hour or two and complete all these profiles , you 'll be a step ahead of most of your competition who wont take the time to do it . <p> Simple , free , and impactful . <p> Start staking your claim online today for free . <h> 2. - Have The Most Helpful Website in Town <p> You may have- heard the term " inbound marketing " which refers to pulling people into your business , typically by providing content or some kind of value that they find first , which begins the relationship with your business . Here is a graphic from HubSpot that demonstrates an inbound marketing funnel : <p> Do n't  let this overwhelm you . <p> Let 's talk about how it relates to you as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New Clients- <p> How- well do you attract new clients from your website today ? <p> Believe it or not , with a little bit of time and effort your website can absolutely become an effective tool for attracting potential clients and then turning them into customers . <p> Here are a couple of simple ways to do it : <p> First , answer- the- most common customer questions on your website . People have all kinds of questions for you , so just start taking note of them and use that as content for your website later on . Perhaps you hear things like : <p> Which kind of contacts are best for me ? <p> What are some natural ways I can improve eye sight ? <p> and many other questions <p> You are in an excellent position to answer each one of these in a more general way on your website . Simply make a blog post that addresses the topic , and then when other people search online for that same information , theyll have an opportunity to find your site . here 's a brilliant talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on how this concept works : <p> In time , adding relevant and quality content to your site will result in other websites linking to things you 've written , and ultimately will increase the " authority " of your website in the eyes of Google . <p> In short , that will help you rank better for more general terms like " Optometrist in CITY " when compared to your less authoritative competitors . <p> Second , - figure out what your audience wants help with and create content to help them . <p> So keyword research- means finding out exactly what people search for in Google , and then analyzing your competition so you can focus your efforts on keywords ( search phrases ) that you have a realistic chance to rank for . <p> Depending on your experience with online marketing , this may sound complicated at first blush but it really is n't . <p> In fact , the concept is really simple . <p> Let 's check an example . <p> If someone were looking for general information on changing from glasses to contacts , they might search @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> As you might imagine , these keywords are VERY competitive and the odds of your local optometry site ranking on page 1 of Google for something like this is very slim . <p> So spending a bunch of time and effort trying to rank for overly competitive terms is usually a waste since your chance of success is so small . <p> So what should you do instead ? <p> The better approach is to focus on low competition keywords that are more specific in nature . <p> As you can see , a keyword like " best contacts for sensitive eyes " is searched 210 times per month , and it has a keyword competitiveness score of " 22 " which means it is a low competition keyword , and something you could hope to rank for if you created a page on your website that was focused on this topic . <p> After doing keyword research , you 'll have a list of keywords you can focus on and rank for in Google without spending any money on advertising . <p> sunoteReady to start finding keywords @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trial of Long Tail Pro and find out what your customers are searching Google for . /sunote <h> 3. - Turn Visitors Into- Patients <p> If you follow steps 1 and 2 , you WILL get more visitors to your website . <p> But how do you turn them into patients ? Here are a couple of ideas : <p> Earn Their Trust <p> The first step is to make sure that your site takes on the tone of a teacher not a salesman . For the people that do visit your site , give unbiased information that demonstrates you are an expert in your field , and most people will begin to trust you . <p> Once they trust you , theyll be more likely to call in for an appointment or consultation when the time comes . <p> Build an Email List <p> Every business should have any email list . This is a fantastic way to stay in front of your customers/patients and your prospective customers with news and updates that are relevant to them . That way , if you have a special event or promotion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to promote it to . <p> But how can you start building a list of names and emails ? <p> One of the simplest ways is to have a " lead magnet " on your site .

@@21641457 @1641457/ <h> How To Start A Website And Make Money The Real Secret <p> Today I came across a video interview of Neil Patel , talking about the value of getting from point A to point B as quickly as possible when it comes to executing an idea . Basically , he was saying to get started with what you have , get feedback , and then improve- your product/service as you go . <p> To illustrate this , he talked about- the different approaches he took in starting 2 of his businesses KISSMetrics and Crazy Egg . Take a look : <p> With KISSmetrics , they spent $1M building out the product only to find out later that their customers did n't  really want what they built . <p> Having learned that lesson , they spent much less time and money creating the first iteration of Crazy Egg , and then getting feedback from customers along the way to perfect their product . <p> I could n't help but see a connection between- what Neil said about his businesses and the approach many people take when- building their first niche @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go from " I 've got an idea for a website about " - to- " I own a website about " . <h> Who is this for ? <p> Obviously people start websites for all kinds of reasons . <p> Today were focused primarily on those who want to- start a successful , money-making website that can supplement or even replace their full-time income . ( If you 're having trouble coming up with ideas for a website , we wrote a post specifically about how to find profitable website ideas ) <p> I had a decent job , but- I was fascinated by the idea of making additional passive income through niche websites . <p> At the time , I had 2 major mental obstacles I was had trouble moving past . Since coming on board as an employee of Long Tail Pro , I 've learned that many others face these same concerns . <h> 2 Common Obstacles To Starting a Website <p> Through personal experience , customer surveys , emails , and other communications Ive learned that there are 2 common fears/obstacles people face when they set out to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 . What if I fail ? - <p> The fear of failure is very real , and can often be paralyzing . If you 're brand new to this , you may lack the confidence that you can really start a website from scratch and make money from it . This concern is understandable . However , the better question to ask is " what do I have to lose ? " Usually the answer is " not much . " One of my favorite things about starting a website is that it really does n't  cost much money to test out an idea . <p> If the idea of family/friends seeing you fail is a concern for you , try this out : <p> Even though I 've got a few websites that have a measure of success , I 've had waaaay more websites/ideas that have completely flopped than those that actually make money . Therefore , I usually keep my new sites/projects under wraps until I 'm further down the road . That way , if I start a website and it totally flops , I do n't  constantly have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going ? " <p> In the end , you simply cant let the fear of failing stop you from trying . <p> 2 . I do n't  know enough about yet . <p> Another common hurdle to actually getting started is simply being obsessed with learning EVERY possible thing . <p> There is no problem with learning , of course , but when you have n't started your website yet because you are trying to figure out how your websites income will affect your tax returns , you 've got a problem . <p> Do n't  be so worried about step 17 that you never take step 1 . You 'll figure out step 17 when you get to step 17 . <p> If you are completely new to this and need help with step 1 , check out our Launch Series videos that will guide you through the process . <h> 1 . It Does n't  Need to be " Perfect " <p> Neil talked about starting Crazy Egg in a relative short amount of time , and by spending far less money than he did with KISSMetrics . Rather than trying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ created the first version and then made it better a little bit at a time . <p> There is a lesson to be learned here if you are still trying to pick a niche to go into . <p> Frankly , the process of finding and picking a niche to go into could go on forever , if you allow it to . <p> The more websites I- see be successful in generating revenue , Im convinced that you do n't  need to find the " perfect niche . " <p> In fact , the perfect niche probably does n't  exist . <p> With just about any niche/topic you can think of , you 'll most likely find somebody with a website in that niche who is making money . To me , this says that there are a large pool of niches in which you can make money if you take the right approach . <p> Rather than obsessing about the " perfect niche " just worry about finding a good niche and then roll with it . <p> You do n't  have to know steps A Z to start @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ research that you 've got enough depth in that topic to create a profitable website. - One way I like to visualize this is thinking of my niche as an umbrella . Then , I do keyword research in Long Tail Pro to look for 20+ low competition keywords that fit under my umbrella . <p> If I can find that many strong keywords in my niche without too much effort , I feel like I 've got a topic where I can be successful . <p> If you do your research and then the website completely flops and never gets any traction you can always go back to square 1 and try again . That 's why its so important to be frugal in the beginning , so any flops do n't  debilitate your future opportunities . <h> 2 . Start Frugal <p> I mentioned earlier that one of the reasons you shouldnt be fearful is that you can start a website for very little money which is just the way I like it . <p> With a niche website , you could buy all the things you need for a couple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea . In that $200 estimate , I 'm including hosting , domain name , logo design on Fiverr , a free WordPress theme , and Long Tail Pro for keyword research . <p> Compared to the cost of other businesses and money-making ventures , $100 $200 is a drop in the bucket . <p> My suggestion is that until you 've proven your niche , you should stay very frugal . <p> Plan on creating the content yourself until you starting picking up traffic and money from your site . <p> Do n't  go out and- buy every SEO tool on the market , pay big bucks for a logo , and start outsourcing content for something that has n't  earned a dime yet . <p> Earn the dime first , then you can start investing the money you make back into the site . <h> 3 . Start Fast <p> Another question Neil answered in the interview was about timing saying that they had the first version of Crazy Egg ready to go in about a month , and then did updates and got more feedback weekly after that . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ start fast . <p> Why ? <p> Because the feeling of starting a website and having a big idea is energizing , but that energy does n't  usually last forever . <p> Take full advantage of that energy and pour yourself into keyword research and content creation in those first few weeks . <p> Unfortunately , some people create a couple of blog posts and then sit back to see if it " works . " When they do n't  see a big rush of traffic right away , they move onto another shiny object and that website starts collecting E-cobwebs . <p> If you are planning on generating organic , search engine traffic to your site it will probably take several months ( at least ) before you start seeing that roll in . <p> This is often called the Google " sandbox " for a new website . <p> When you expect that your effort wont pay off immediately , it becomes easier to stay motivated and knock out as much content as possible in the first month or two . <p> By starting fast , you 'll have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes . <p> sunoteReady to take action ? - Click Here to take a 10 day free trial of- Long Tail Pro . /sunote <h> 6 Comments <p> Andrea on November 23 , 2015 at 4:44 pm <p> Nice article ! I definitely suffer the shiny-object syndrome , but it kicks in when I get stuck 90% of the times in the same part : testing the idea . Everything I read online , all courses , books , etc tell you to test your idea first before putting too much time into it . However , the hard part comes in finding how to test your idea if you are brand new and have no list . Ive read that facebook ads are a good way to test the idea and also participating in FB groups . <p> My question to you isdo you think that doing good keyword research could be used to " test the idea " ? and avoid facebook group stocking or spending money in FB Ads ? <p> Really good question I realize some might disagree with me , but I 'm a big fan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( until they start to make money on their own . ) So that said , I believe enough in keyword research that I 'll pick a niche and start a site , and then build out the first batch of content on my own . Then , I may do a little promotion/email outreach to others in that niche to hopefully get links/shares or a little momentum , but from there I 'll keep building content and waiting for my site to rank and pull in traffic . <p> Once it starts making money ( Adsense , affiliate offers , etc . ) Ill then start reinvesting that money into more content or perhaps something like Facebook ads . <p> If for some reason Im 6 months in and cant get any traction , I shift my focus to a different site but at least I 'm not out a huge sum of money . <p> Honestly , if I had a big chunk of extra money sitting around this answer might be different and I might spend more on ads , etc. before my site had made any money but personally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reply ! I feel that **26;189;TOOLONG analysis should technically give me the same insights as if I had the means to run a test before launching . Of course running a test has other advantages but we have to start somewhere . <p> Last question if you do n't  mindWould you do the same for a website that is supposed to make you money from selling a product rather than using affiliates , AdSense , etc ? <p> It depends " is it a physical product ? Or a digital product of some kind ? <p> If a digital product , then yes , I 'd do the same thing " just really focusing my keyword research on things that my ideal audience ( IE people who would want to buy my product ) might be searching . That way , when I start picking up traffic I have a very logical offer for the traffic I 'm already getting . <p> I 'm actually going down this road right now with a site . Honestly the digital product was a bit of an afterthought in my case , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makes sense to create our own online course since most of our traffic has the same interest/problem . <p> If a physical product , I 'd consider selling it on Amazon FBA first to see if you can get sales there . Then , if you start selling it , you could work on your website and all these other things . Spencer has talked a little bit about that on NichePursuits.com recently if you want to check it out . <p> Hi , I 've been using the trial version of long tail pro and I do like it , but I have to say , I have searched a couple dozen seed keywords now and am having a difficult time finding very many keywords that rank under 30 for competition . The few I have found , when I take a look at the top ten sites , most of them are authority sites . <p> It really feels like finding a good niche for affiliate marketing is very difficult because it is over saturated and the high number of authority sites . <p> And for the record , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a thousand plus searches . I 'm drilling way down and looking at four plus keywords with as little as 100 searches a month . Even these keywords rarely rank under 30 and seem to be dominated by authority sites . It is very discouraging . <p> When that happens , dig a little deeper in the serps and check out the actual pages ranking . If you can create a better more resourceful article with proper on-page SEO and formatting for a superior user experience , there is no reason not target that keyword . This is especially true if you already have a site in the niche and you can leverage your own site DA .

Giveaway Your Services <p> In fact , we 've seen targeted giveaways work well in a variety of different industries , including our own software business . <p> When you do it right , you can pull in a bunch of new leads and drum up quite a bit of business . <p> When I first mentioned doing a " giveaway , " what was the first thing you thought about giving away in order to get people to give you their name and contact information ? <p> Most people immediately think of something like an iPad or a flat screen TV . <p> After all , you want to give away something with mass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seem counterintuitive , but remember that your goal is to get targeted- leads that you can turn into new customers/patients . <p> What do you know about people who sign up for your free iPad contest ? <p> You only know that they want an iPad . <p> You really have no idea if they are looking for a dentist or even need dental services . <p> A better approach is to give away something that only your target audience would want . Something much more narrowly focused , like a free teeth whitening session . <p> What do you know about someone who enters your contest for free teeth whitening ? <p> You know that they are interested in getting their teeth whitened . <p> This is a much more qualified lead for your business than the iPad guy . <p> How To Make It Work <p> In the example provided in earlier report I referenced , they estimated that a dentist who offers teeth whitening as an " up sell " can expect to add about $120 to their average- lifetime value of a patient . <p> That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - Even offering something with no doctor time , like Supreme whitening kits from Crest , can profit the office about $24 per sale on average . <p> Here are a few steps to follow that you can customize for your own business : <p> Find something that you can give away that is also a service you can sell to everyone who does n't  " win " the contest . <p> I 'd recommend using a system designed to manage online contests . We 've used Contest Domination and highly recommend it . <p> At the conclusion of the contest , simply email everyone who entered and create a page on your website where you announce the winner , and offer some kind of limited time offer to everyone who did n't  win , but still wants whatever you gave away . <p> Let 's say you gave away- a free whitening session . Perhaps you could offer special pricing on whitening for everyone else , but only if they book within a certain period of time . If not special pricing , perhaps you could work in a free bonus add-on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get creative with it , but the concept works ! <h> 2 . Simple List Building <p> Building an email list can be a game changer for almost any business . This gives you a steady group of followers that you can contact when you add new content to your website , offer special deals , or have upcoming events . <p> If you are n't  building an email list , you are missing out on a huge opportunity . For further reading , check out some of these list building ideas . <p> The idea I 'm going to share with you is a little old school , and was shared with me by Laura Nunemaker who actually used this technique when she owned a local bakery . <p> She said we put out a legal pad , pen and simple flyer in a- plastic frame describing the benefits of our weekly email newsletter . There- were no prizes or promised discounts for signing up but we still cleared- about a dozen sign-ups a week . " <p> Again , there is an opportunity to get creative here , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a pen near where people sign in or perhaps where they check out could get you started building an email list . <p> Maybe instead of advertising it as a newsletter , put together a free video or PDF report that you can email them when they sign up . Maybe its 10 tips for naturally whitening your teeth , or some other information that would incentivize people to- give you their preferred email address . <p> This idea is free , and something you can start today . <h> 3. - Feature Your Customers <p> We all love to be featured and be honored " so when people see themselves as the customer of the week , or community member of the week , etc. they usually want to share that with friends . Maybe you could have a " Smile of the Week " campaign . <p> Get creative with it ! <p> One example of this was discussed in our post about getting more followers on Instagram. - The Bouqs , a flower delivery service , reposts pictures they 've found from happy customers sharing photos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , this also serves as a form of a testimonial as they are showing non-professional photos , submitted by customers , of their product in action . This helps make the Bouqs appear more transparent , since they are simply reposting what happy customers have already- posted voluntarily . <p> How could your practice start featuring your own happy clients and benefit from the social sharing that follows ? <h> Wrap Up <p> Hopefully these 3 ideas have got your wheels turning a little about how your dental business can get more creative with your marketing efforts and start making an impact to the bottom line without spending a ton of money .

@@21641462 @1641462/ <p> Were often asked about what the differences are between the Long Tail Pro and Market Samurai keyword tools . Certainly there are some similarities in the functionality , but there are also quite a few key differences . Here is a breakdown of Long Tail Pro vs . Market Samurai : <h> Keyword Tool Basics <p> The fundamental concept behind long tail keywords is finding keywords that you can target with your content that are searched often enough , but also have relatively low competition . The idea is finding that sweet spot so you can put together a well-optimized page targeting that keyword , and have a strong chance of moving up to the first page of Google for that search term . <p> So at a basic level , a keyword research tool should help you find keyword ideas , see how often it is searched , and then analyze the competition for that keyword . <p> As it sounds , this can be a somewhat time consuming process when you need to find a large amount of keywords . So one of the benefits of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time. - Let 's look at some of the differences between Market Samurai and Long Tail Pro when it comes to time savings . <h> Speed Comparison <p> When you 're doing keyword research , its critical to be able to generate and analyze many keywords in a short amount of time . Both Long Tail Pro and Market Samurai start by letting you add " seed " keywords to get started , and then the software will use Googles data to give you ideas of similar keywords . <p> However , in Market Samurai this is done one at a time . So you would add a seed keyword , generate the ideas , and then you can go back and do the same for another keyword if you 'd like . In Long Tail Pro , you can add 5 10 seed keywords and generate all the ideas at once . In fact , you 'll get up to 800 keyword ideas per seed word , so that gives you the potential to generate up to 8,000 keywords in just a couple of minutes . <p> This 1 keyword at a time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to create Long Tail Pro . Here is a video of Spencer showing Long Tail Pro vs . Market Samurai with a stopwatch running in the background . Check out the difference in time savings : <p> Another thing Spencer touched on in the video is the difference in how the two products filter out keywords . After all , you might have some pretty specific ideas about what kinds of keywords you are looking for . <p> For example , if you are building a niche website that you plan to monetize through Google Adsense , you might want to filter out keywords that are only worth a few cents per click . Maybe you only want to see keywords that Google says have a cost per click of $2 or more . <p> Another filter idea may be taking out words that do n't  get the kind of search volume you are looking for . Let 's say if the keyword gets searched less than 500 times per month , you do n't  even want to see it in your list . Let 's take a look at how filtering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As mentioned earlier , there are a number of different reasons you may want to filter out keywords . Maybe they do n't  get searched enough , maybe- you only want to see really long phrases ( keywords with at least 4 words ) and the list goes on . <p> Both Market Samurai and Long Tail Pro will let you set these types of filters . The key difference is when and how they do it . <p> In Market Samurai , keyword filtering is done after you 've generated the keywords . <p> So if I put in " dog training " as my starter keyword and then generate ideas , after my list is complete I can then go to the top of the page and say I want to only see keywords with 1,000 searches or more . It will do the filter for you , the issue is that it adds some more waiting time before you see the list of keywords you really want . <p> In Long Tail Pro , filtering is done before you generate keywords : <p> By doing it beforehand , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just the keywords that meet your criteria . Once you 've got your list of keywords , arguably the most important part of the process is doing your competitive analysis . <h> Competitive Analysis <p> Both Long Tail Pro and Market Samurai will help you analyze your competition . The goal is to figure out how likely you are to be able to rank in the top 10 for a given keyword by quickly analyzing the important metrics . <p> Both tools have a similar layout when doing competition analysis , and some of the same data . For instance , both will show you the number of backlinks to a page , how old the domain is , and show you if the keyword is being used in the page title . Here is a video showing how Market Samurai analyzes the competition . <p> Probably the biggest difference in the data you receive in competition analysis is the integrated Moz data in Long Tail Pro . Specifically , you are able to see the domain authority and page authority of each of the top 10 results . <p> Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the idea of domain authority ( DA ) . By combining all the link metrics they track , it is their indication of a domains chances of ranking well in search and generally tracking the strength of that site over time . So the higher your DA , the bigger authority you have . Page authority is the same concept , but it is at the page level . Page authority may be even more important- for our purposes because it is that specific page you are competing against , not necessarily the domain as a whole . <p> In addition to the Moz data , the premium version of Long Tail Pro known as Long Tail Platinum does most of the work for you . In Long Tail Platinum , you have access to a proprietary calculation called Average Keyword Competitiveness ( KC ) . In short , you can click a " calculate " button and the software will give you a number between 1 and 100 to indicate how difficult it would be to crack the top 10 for that keyword . <p> In general , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the lower the better for you ! ) The low to mid-thirties would be a medium competition keyword , and then anything approaching 40 and on up is typically something that is tough to rank for .

Some users have commented that they see that KC scores are coming in somewhat higher than they have in the past . Most of you ( platinum users anyways ) will have seen this graphic in the past : <p> Were aware of this issue and we plan to re-calibrate KC so that the old rule ( KC under 30 being a good KW to target ) will apply , but for the moment we suggest users look for KWs under KC 40 rather than 30 . <p> We anticipate that we will have the KC scores tweaked within 3 weeks , possibly sooner . <p> We apologize for the inconvenience this might cause , but we really do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long run for all our users as their data is just more comprehensive and more accurate . <p> Some users have also been asking how they should examine SERP results with Majestic- data versus Moz data . To address these user concerns , we 've decided to put together a brief guide on how to use each of the Majestic metrics ( this is outside of KC score ) . <p> The first and most important thing to understand about the Majestic data we provide is the difference between Citation Flow and Trust Flow . <p> In simple terms , Citation- Flow measures the number- of links to a page or domain its purely a quantitative measure used to measure the- volume of links . <p> Trust Flow measures the quality of the links to a page or domain . The way that Majestic has this setup is that there are a group of sites that they deem trustworthy for example , sites like Wikipedia or the New York Times website might be considered high quality , reliable , trustworthy sites . A site that gets a ton of links from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ From there , the trust flows with each link , with the amount of trust from a link reducing the further you get from the trustworthy original site at the top of the chain of links . <p> We use a mixture of TF and CF to calculate the new KC score we do this because both the quantity and quality of links matter when it comes to ranking . <p> The reason why there is Trust Flow and Citation Flow as well as Domain TF and Domain CF is because Majestic has opted not to name its domain metrics separately so we can check the TF/CF of a domain as well as the TF/CF of a page . <p> This is slightly different from Moz , where- they 've split what is essentially metric into two by naming them Domain Authority and Page Authority . <p> Essentially , some mixture of Domain TF and CF would correspond to Mozs Domain Authority , and some mixture of the Trust Flow and Citation Flow columns in the above image would correspond to Mozs Page Authority . <p> The key difference here would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe that the Majestic metrics are therefore more accurate than the Moz metrics . <p> Some users have also been wondering what values they should be targeting with regards to TF/CF and their domain equivalents as a rough guide , here are our suggested targets for users who have relatively new sites that have gained some traction and that already have some kind of small link profile : <p> Page CF : Below 35 <p> Page TF : Below 20 <p> Domain CF : Below 55 <p> Domain TF : Below 40 <p> For users who are literally just starting their sites now , we 'd recommend even lower targets in this case , the goal is not to target the average numbers the goal is to find SERPs with keywords that have- at least 4 or 5 results within- these guidelines ( it will be very rare to find keywords that have averages that are below these figures the idea is that you want at least 4 or 5 results that you can confidently say that you 'll be able to beat ) . <p> Page CF : Below 20 <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 40 <p> Domain TF : Below 20 <p> Keep in mind that these are only rough guidelines analyzing SERPs is a skill that you build over time , and that 's the whole reason why we offer our proprietary- Keyword Competitiveness score , which takes into account not only the TF/CF metrics , but also Title/url targeting , site age , and a variety of other factors . <p> Also , you should factor in the idea that even though the average metrics across a SERP might not be beatable , if there are a number of particularly weak results in any given SERP , its possible that you can beat out those results . For example , a SERP with results from Wikipedia , Youtube , and Amazon would have very high average Domain TF/CF scores , but if the remaining 7 results are all pretty weak , it may still be worth targeting . <p> The column External Backlinks measures the number of links that the individual page has pointing to it . Referring Domains measures the number of external domains that have links pointing to the individual page @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ page has from . edu or . gov domains ( these are generally considered very strong links ) . <p> Internal Links measure the number of links the page has from other pages on the same domain , and Indexed URLs measures the number of pages that Majestic sees the domain has ( i.e the size of the site ) . <p> Hopefully with an explanation of some of the new columns you see in the updated Long Tail Pro , users will be more comfortable using the new and improved data . <p> We 've also got some big more big updates to Long Tail Pro coming up in the next few weeks including a much awaited cloud version of Long Tail Pro that runs in you browser . Were really quite excited for that , and we think you should be too .

In order for this to happen , you need great content that is keyword targeted . <p> To reiterate : that means writing a blog post regularly ( whether that is once a day , once a week , or twice a month is up to you ) on a topic that is relevant to what you sell and helps your customers . <p> Here is an example I always use : <p> Imagine you sell pool equipment .

Which means more business for you . And in fact this trend is increasing with more and more tools focusing on this area- like Canva ( for easy image creation ) and MavSocial ( image focused social media management ) .

Instead , its about providing an experience that your students will benefit from- and will keep them coming back for more . <p> Unfortunately , you could be the foremost martial arts expert in your area but if nobody knows about your services , you 'll likely struggle to thrive . <p> So how do you take the first step ? <p> How can you get more students in the door and increase awareness about your school ? <p> Here are a few simple marketing ideas for your martial arts school that will increase awareness and help you build your brand . <h> 1. - Claim Your Space Online <p> Face it every business should have a strong online presence in order to maximize their marketing efforts . <p> Fortunately , there are a few things you can do that are absolutely free and still make a big impact . <p> Whether you realize it or not , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Dojo ) . <p> Even if people learn about you from a friend or from a booth at a local event they are very likely to go " Google " your school to see what kind of reviews you have online , or maybe look for pictures of your facility to learn more before they spend any of their own money . <p> If you 've spent no time doing the basics online , who knows what these people are finding ! <p> The First Step <p> First off you really need a first-rate website for your school- so when people are looking for you online , they can find you and you make a strong first impression . - If you do n't  have a site of your own , its not as hard as you think . <p> Well talk more about your website later on <p> Assuming you have a website that exists , then the first step is to make sure that at the very least youve claimed your spot as a Google Business . <p> The result is that when people look for your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more generic things like " martial arts schools in YOUR CITY " - or maybe even " karate lessons in YOUR CITY " you 'll have a better looking , more complete profile in Google like you see below : <p> In addition to having accurate and complete information about your school , you can also do things like : <p> Respond on behalf of your business to reviews left on Google . <p> Add nice looking photos of your facility- that will show up in Googles listing . Make sure your facility looks its best in these photos ! <p> Add accurate hours and location information . <p> Put your phone number and other contact info that people need to know . <p> Google owns the largest market share as far as search engines go , - but there are at least a dozen large directories , search engines , review sites , etc. that you should be completing your profile on mostly for the same reasons I mentioned about Google . <p> Most let you claim a business for free , but may also offer some paid services which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take an hour or two and complete all these profiles , you 'll be a step ahead of most of your competition who wont take the time to do it . <p> Simple , free , and impactful . <p> Start staking claiming your space online for free . <h> 2 . Incentivize Referrals <p> Do you have a referral program in place ? <p> If so , how is it working ? <p> If it is n't generating new referral customers , then maybe its time to re-think it . <p> Referral programs can work in a variety of different businesses , and they are a fantastic way to grow your membership by getting the word of mouth advertising train rolling . <p> But in order for it to work , your incentives have to be things that connect with your current students . <p> Youd like to think that theyll just spread the word about your martial arts lessons for no reason , and maybe they will , but offering a reward that your students really want will increase the likelihood that theyll actively recruit new students on your behalf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , new karate training gear , or some other benefit for every new student they refer . <p> You could even have different referral incentives for different age groups , to make sure the award fits the audience . <p> If you have tried a referral program that did n't  pick up any steam , try asking your students ( or their parents ) for some ideas about the kinds of rewards theyd be interested in. <h> 3 . Consider Your Entire- Audience <p> You may specialize in instructing a certain age group or type of student , such as young children . <p> If so , do n't  forget that you are marketing as much to their parents as you are to the students themselves . <p> Obviously if their kids love your karate class , the parents will be more likely to keep coming back for more . However , if you can also delight the parents who bring them and ultimately pay the bill , you 'll be almost certain to have a long time customer . <p> How can you do that ? - <p> Make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have just a few uncomfortable chairs and virtually no amenities , its likely that parents do n't  necessarily enjoy coming to your school and waiting around for their childs lesson . <p> On the other hand , if you offer things like comfortable seating , free wifi , a Keurig coffee machine , and a flat screen tv the time they spend at your school will be more enjoyable . <p> Other things to consider are a small play area for younger siblings , and having your waiting area situated in a way that parents who prefer to watch class can easily do so without having to stand or sit in an awkward position . <p> What 's more , this becomes something you can use back at step 1 for taking business photos to add to your Google profile . <p> Its a new selling point for you . <p> If a parent is comparing local martial arts schools and one has a well thought out , parent-friendly area to wait and the other does not which do you think theyll choose ? <p> Do n't  overlook small details that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 4. - Get Customers From Your Website <p> Once youve setup a nice looking , basic website that makes a solid first impression its time to take it to the next level . <p> How do you do that ? <p> By using a blog to connect with your existing customers , and your prospective customers . <p> What should you write about ? - <p> The quickest way to come up with content ideas for your website is to simply blog about questions you hear all the time from your students . These could be things about martial arts techniques , advice for choosing an instructor , and much more . <p> The concept is simple : if people ask you these questions in person , then there are probably many other people who ask those questions online ( via Google search ) . <p> When they do , some website is going to be there to answer their question . <p> Why cant that be you ? <p> With the right strategy and effort , it really can be . <p> Who knows , you may end up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a digital product such as a martial arts video training or maybe your own line of training products or accessories . <p> Below is an example from Karate By Jesse who does exactly what I 'm talking about - sharing his karate expertise on his blog . <p> Perhaps that sounds far-fetched for you today , but if you decide to become an online authority in martial arts it is absolutely possible . <p> Once you 're tapped out of ideas from personal experience , its time to start discovering other content ideas . <p> Basically , it helps you discover exactly what people are searching for in the world on martial arts and let 's you know which phrases would be the best to target based on how often its searched and how difficult the competition is . <p> sunoteReady to start finding keywords ? - Click Here to take a 10 day free trial of Long Tail Pro and find out what your customers are searching Google for . /sunote 
@@21641472 @1641472/ <p> We all want to be wise about how we spend our money particularly when it comes to advertising and marketing your business . <p> Interestingly enough , some of the most effective marketing tools are the ones that cost the least . <p> Youve certainly heard how powerful " word of mouth " advertising is when someone shares their positive ( or negative ) personal experience with someone they know . What you may not realize is just how impactful other online reviews from people you do n't  know can be . <p> According to a 2014 survey by BrightLocal , 88% of consumers read reviews ( usually 10 or more ) and 88% of consumers report that they actual trust reviews online as much as personal recommendations . <p> That 's huge ! <p> If you are n't  collecting online reviews for your business , were going to share a simple strategy for how you can start . But first , take a look at the infographic below which illustrates the amount of trust consumers place in various forms of marketing : <p> Notice that 2 of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then reviews that are left online . <p> Assuming you are selling your own product or service , this really is n't something you- can afford to overlook . <p> Here- is a simple strategy for getting more online reviews for your business : <h> Be Proactive <p> As much as wed like to believe that most people will love us so much that theyll both remember and take the time to circle back and share their feedback it usually does n't  happen that way . <p> Look no further than Amazon , who has millions of reviews for their enormous catalog of products . <p> They understand that people have to be reminded to review the products they receive . <p> As an Amazon shopper , Ive seen quite a few of these kinds of emails over the years : <p> Likewise if your business needs more reviews and testimonials , you have to proactively and ( ideally ) systematically ask for them . <p> This is something we 've started doing with our own business , through a service called Review Trust . Basically , we integrated it with our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they automatically get an email from us a couple weeks later asking them to review the product . <p> When they do , we display those reviews on our blog so people who are considering Long Tail Pro can read what recent buyers have to say .

( most of them very positive ) <h> How To Get Started <p> While we 've found a system in Review Trust that makes things very simple to automate and display on your website , you certainly do n't  have to use it to make this work . <p> If you have an email system or CRM where you manage buyers and tag them appropriately , it could be as simple as adding a review request to your auto-responder series . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like Survey Monkey and ask about their experience . <p> These simple steps should provide you with a number of solid reviews to add to your website , and give you an opportunity to get constructive feedback and follow-up with customers who are n't  so happy .

Generally , commissions range from 4% 8.5% of the purchase price , based on how many sales you refer in a given month . <p> 2 . Many people are loyal customers to Amazon and some pay extra for fast shipping with Amazon Prime <p> 3 . Since Amazon sells such a variety of things , its not uncommon for you to get commissions on completely unrelated products . <p> I wont spend anymore time explaining the " how and why " of Amazon Associates . I 'm going to assume you are on board and already see the potential value of having a successful Amazon affiliate site . <p> While the technical aspects for getting started with the Amazon Associates program are pretty easy , being a really successful Amazon affiliate is not . <p> Here are 3 ways to make more as an Amazon affiliate , if you 're willing to work for it <h> 1 . Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been around for a little while , you can smell a " typical " affiliate site the moment the page loads. - It- does n't  feel like a real brand and it seems like everything on the site only exists to get you to go to Amazon and buy whatever it is that they are " reviewing . " <p> I 'm not saying you cant make money this way , but I would contend that those who integrate Amazon affiliate links into a branded , authority site will earn considerably more- over time . <p> They write real , in-depth product reviews and comparisons . In the context of those reviews , they have affiliate links to go purchase the product from Amazon , like this : <p> Besides specific guides like " The Best Android Phone " they also do wider categories like the best gear for travel . Notice that they have a custom designed feature image which further creates a sense of trust with the user that this is a legit , trustworthy site . <p> In their guide to the best travel gear , they cover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speakers , luggage , pillows , towels , and much more . <p> If you want to buy any of the travel gear they recommend , guess where they send you to buy it ? <p> The entire experience at the Wire Cutter demonstrates that they are truly experts in the topics they cover . In the end , youd almost feel dumb for not buying the product that- they recommend . <p> That is the recipe for an Amazon affiliate site that rakes in money . <h> Just How Well Do They Do ? <p> The powerful thing about following a model like the Wire Cutter is how willing people are to- take your recommendation . After all , many of your visitors have- come to your site because they are intent on making a purchase and you 've just delivered almost everything they need to know in order to make an informed buying decision . <p> According to a 2012 article in the New York Times- about The Wire Cutter : - " The vast majority of its revenue comes from fees paid by affiliates , mostly Amazon , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 20 percent of its visitors click on links , a rate that would make ad sellers drool . " <p> They go onto say " Mr. Lam 's revenue is low , about $50,000 a month , but it 's doubling every quarter , enough to pay his freelancers , invest in the site and keep him in surfboards . " <p> That was in 2012 <h> How You Can Do the Same <p> Let 's be honest , going from nothing to The Wire Cutter is a monumental task . However , you should be encouraged that according to the same Times article , Brian Lam did " bootstrap " that site with no outside investors . <p> Fortunately in 2015 , there are so many cheap and free tools available for website design , graphic design , and other services that you can look much bigger than you really are without spending a fortune . <p> I 'm also going to assume that many of you would n't need to make 6 figures per month you 'd be thrilled to make just a few thousand , which is much more doable . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you are building an Amazon affiliate site , you should only do it with excellence . Yes , that will take more time and effort but that 's kinda the point ! There are tons of low quality Amazon affiliate sites out there , but there are very few Wire Cutters . <p> Here are few tips : <p> Really know your niche , or hire an expert/writer that does . Expertise or lack thereof will show through <h> 2 . Target Buyer Keywords <p> We 've already established that your site has to cut the mustard . You need to look the part and provide high quality , accurate and helpful content to your users . In return , many will trust what you tell them and buy the products you recommend . <p> But what is the best way to get potential buyers on your site ? <p> One of the most effective ( and free ) ways is to target the right " buyer keywords " in your content . Buyer keywords are simply phrases that one searches which show clear intent to buy something . Maybe its " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Laptop for $500 " etc . <p> here 's an example of what I mean : <p> Let 's assume you are doing an Amazon affiliate site that is all about- tires . You are going to review car tires of all shapes and sizes . <p> Wouldnt it be nice if your site could rank on page 1 for " tires " or " car tires ? " <p> It gets searched over 300,000 times per month , with a keyword competitiveness score of 55 . The top 10 results are littered with the big guys in the industry like Cooper Tire , Tirerack.com , Sears , etc . <p> Somehow I do n't  see some site called **30;217;TOOLONG cracking the top 10 here <h> Focus on the Positive <p> You can absolutely build a niche/authority site about tires and do very well by targeting the right buyer keywords . <p> If you are looking for some ideas of- terms that typically show up in buyer keywords , check out the list from Niche Hacks . - Best , avoid , compare , dependable , how to get rid of , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buyer intent . <p> To illustrate the point , someone simply searching " tires " does n't  have the clearest of intent . What exactly do they want to know about tires ? It could be simply doing general research , looking for bike tires , and tons of other possibilities . <p> However , the guy searching " best tires for driving in snow " has a very clear intent . You know what he s looking for and your site has a much better chance to rank in Google for " best tires for driving in snow " than you do " tires . " <p> here 's how you can use Long Tail Platinum to look for keyword ideas that contain buyer intent . Notice in this search , I 'm using " tires " as a seed keyword and then adding " best " to the list of words that it must include . Therefore , all my keyword ideas will include the word " best . " <p> Now I 've got a bunch of keywords to analyze the competition for : <h> Focus on the Negative <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " negative " keywords . <p> Many people are looking for " problems with " or " complaints about " certain brands or certain types of products . When you can provide content that addresses those problems , again you have the opportunity to present a solution . <p> It might go something like this : <p> " Yes , the Cooper x3000s have problems in the snow . However , if you do X , Y , and Z you should be just fine ! If you live in an area with large amounts of snow , then I 'd suggest taking a look at our highest rated snow tire the Goodyear B105 ( Amazon affiliate link ) . " <p> here 's another example where something negative can be a selling opportunity : <p> Somebody searching " how to get rid steering wheel- vibration " is someone whose problem might be solved by getting a new set of tires . By educating that person on the common causes of your steering wheel- vibrating ( like worn out tires ) , you then have the opportunity to suggest a recommended set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good and bad buyer keywords , you 'll have many more opportunities to recommend products as an affiliate . <h> 3. - Let Your Passion Guide You <p> Youve probably seen and heard countless times to " follow your passion " and things will work out . <p> That 's not exactly what I 'm saying here . <p> However , I want to show you a brilliant example of someone who started with a mission- they were passionate about , and later turned it into Amazon affiliate income . <p> Lisa of 100 Days of Real Food <p> Enter Jason and Lisa Leake of 100 Days of Real Food . <p> According to their story , they are parents of 2 kids who were eating a " diet " just like a typical American family . Then , in early 2010 they learned about the importance of eating non-processed food and what the benefits could be . <p> They started a personal challenge to cut all processed food from their family diet after reading " In Defense of Food . " <p> Lisa says " It 's been such an eye opening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all this exciting information to ourselves . So soon after we started making changes I launched a blog called The Food Illusion " <p> Interestingly enough , I 've personally been a reader of Lisas blog for a year or two and never even realized that being an Amazon affiliate was part of their business plan . <p> I was drawn in by the clever ideas for eating well on a budget , real food substitutes for picky eaters , tips for what to have in your kitchen , etc . <p> More recently , I discovered her husband Jasons blog which gives insight into how they make money on their- real food site. - According to his report , they do make a full-time income blogging and about 23% of that comes from affiliate sales ( mostly Amazon . ) <p> The- most relevant piece of this story is their mentality going in . <p> They did n't  start by saying " I 'd really like to make an Amazon affiliate site , what can we do it about ? " <p> Instead , actual life events led them to sharing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ natural opportunity to make money as an Amazon affiliate ( among other things . ) <p> That is a HUGE difference . <p> As we stated at the very beginning , Amazon sells just about every kind of product that you can imagine . So while some niches may be more lucrative than others , if you are creative enough there are probably opportunities to incorporate Amazon affiliate links in a site that is focused on what you are truly passionate about . <p> here 's how 100 Days of Real Food did it : - <p> I love learning from examples , and Jason was generous enough to share a blog post that lists their top 10 pages for Amazon affiliate income . Here is a link to the full post. - <p> I 'm including the list here if you want to check out some of the pages : <p> Its interesting that they have several different types of pages/posts- here that are performing well . It really helps cement the point earlier about the variety of keywords that can really be buyer keywords if you structure it properly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to use thermos food jars " which answers the question and then links to their preferred thermos on Amazon . <p> They have lists posts like " 10 ways to switch up your kids lunch " where again they will give authentic product recommendations in the context of a very helpful post . <p> They also have pages that are still helpful , but were likely built with the intent to sell such as " recommended reading " and " my kitchen essentials . " <p> In the blog post referenced earlier , Jason said " Talk about products you actually use and recommend . People actually value a legitimate product review , and providing examples of the product in use can make people want to buy . " <p> Again this is a shift in mentality . <p> The site is there to genuinely help people first , not to sell products . <h> Wrapping Up <p> Hopefully youve come away with at least one thing that you can use to make more money as an Amazon affiliate . <p> The good news is also the bad news <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Its good news because- most of your competitors are n't  willing to dig into keyword research- and build high quality sites that provide true value to the user . <p> Its bad news because you ca n't be a success overnight . However , you can start today ! <p> Thanks , Michael ! I did n't  dig too deeply into that , but I 'd have to imagine its a ridiculous amount . <p> They rank top 5 for things like Macbook Air , Standing Desk , Best Gaming Laptop , and Waterproof Camera . So the site is quite a powerhouse at this point , but it looks like at the heart of it is still selling other peoples products . <p> Excellent article Jake ! I 'm guilty of owning a few of those typical Amazon review sites and , if I 'm being honest with myself , I do n't  much like them . Far better to have just the one where you can pour your passion into it and enjoy the process . <p> Extremely useful article . The key lesson to take home is that you do not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provide useful and informative content and then monetize the traffic with Amazon .

So we like to at least have our reader be a bit interested in the subject they are starting their site on , so that when the going gets tough , the passion gets going = <p> Sorry but i have to disagree here , it is about making money , at least that is why i am into it , that is what my " passion " is , if we could not make money with this none of us would be building websites just for fun .

@@21641474 @1641474/ <h> 3 Ideas For Getting Better Keyword Suggestions From Ubersuggest <p> For those who use Long Tail Platinum , one of most powerful features is the ability to quickly import up to 10,000 of your own keyword ideas analyze them with the filtering , sorting , and competitive analysis tools inside of Long Tail Platinum . <p> When I was first starting to use the software , I always wondered how in the world someone could think of thousands of their own keywords to analyze . <p> My process was to add seed keywords and get my ideas only from Long Tail Pros suggestions . <p> Perhaps I would randomly think of a keyword idea and do a quick analysis but 10,000 keywords ? ! - <h> Fast Forward To Today <p> Obviously I write this today as a full-time employee of Long Tail Pro . My primary function is to market the business , and as part of that I use our own software to find lower competition keywords that we can rank for and then introduce those organic visitors to our software . <p> Since LTP has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picked up on a few techniques that have really helped me find better keyword ideas ; and find them faster than ever . <p> Ubersuggest simply takes whatever keyword you type in and then provides you all of the suggested searches ( from Bing ) for that keyword . It goes down every letter of the alphabet and gives you hundreds of suggestions in a matter of seconds . The result looks something like this ( my keyword was " beard " ) : <p> As you can imagine , you 'll often have some excellent keyword ideas in this list with a low KC score . <p> Now , almost every keyword campaign I run has a combination of seed keywords and hundreds or even thousands of suggestions that I copy/paste from Ubersuggest . <p> Today I want to share a few ideas and examples of how you can make the most of this free tool : <h> 1 . Get " Buyer " Suggestions <p> A " buyer keyword " is a term you may have heard before . <p> Basically , it refers to a keyword that shows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which suggests that they are close to purchasing something . <p> Examples of buyer keywords could be : <p> " Best laptop under $500 " - <p> " Best smartphone for grandparents " <p> " Where to buy used stove " <p> Ubersuggest becomes more powerful when you are creative about the keyword you type in to start the process . <p> In the screenshot above , I had simply typed in " beard " and then run suggestions . <p> I may get some decent keyword ideas out of that , but if I start by typing in the beginning of a buyer keyword I can find some true long tail gems . <p> here 's an example : - <p> If I had a website about running , I might want to do a some content about the best running shoes for different situations and types of people . <p> Rather than opening Ubersuggest and just typing in " running shoes , " try starting with this buyer-focused variety : " best running shoes for " <p> When I do , I get a total of 854 suggestions including @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ From there , I simply copy/paste all the ideas into Long Tail Platinum so I can determine which keywords have the right mix of a low competitiveness score , and a fair amount of search volume . <p> In less than 5 minutes , I 've already found a couple of excellent keywords like " best running shoes for plantar fasciitis " and " best running shoes for women with flat feet . " <p> On my running website , I 'd likely create 2 big buyers guides for each of these scenarios and talk about the things to consider , features to look for , and then recommend specific shoes for people in that situation . <h> 2 . Compared to What ? <p> This is an important point because no matter what your niche is ; your target audience is comparing things too . <p> While some of the comparisons might be obvious , there could be some that you have n't thought of that would make an excellent keyword-focused blog topic for your site . <p> Try dropping some " vs. " keywords into Ubersuggest and see what happens . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compete with the big brands in fitness you really need to find some keywords that you can rank for . <p> Let 's try " Crossfit vs. " and see what we get . <p> I get a total of 577 suggestions , including good ideas like : <p> Again , I paste all of these ideas into Long Tail Platinum and start calculating the keyword competitiveness score for any that I might want to target . Within just a couple of minutes , I 've found a few winners : <p> I do n't  even know what " orange theory fitness " is , but if I had a fitness blog you better believe that I 'd be working on my write-up to compare Crossfit to OrangeTheory Fitness . <p> With a KC of 16 and 140 searches per month , that is a fantastic opportunity to pull in some organic traffic and get those people to opt-in to your list via a content upgrade or some other kind of lead magnet . <p> The best part is ; you do n't  have to stop here . <p> Once you 've gone through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vs. " and then " Personal Trainer vs. " and see what other ideas you come up with . <p> My guess is that within a couple of hours you 'd have enough content ideas to keep you busy for months . <h> 3 . What Should I Teach ? <p> One common use for a blog is to teach people how to do something . <p> Ultimately your goal may be to sell them something , but the avenue to get there is often earning their trust by helping them solve some of their problems . <p> But how do you know what you should be teaching your audience ? <p> Suggestion tools can help with that too ! <p> Let 's switch away from running and fitness and look at an example for a site about gardening . <p> One way to figure out what your audience wants to know is to find what they are searching " how to " do . <p> I 'm going to roll with " how to grow a garden . " <p> While this seems like a very obvious keyword to start with , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ situations and scenarios people are looking for help with . <p> Check out some of these suggested searches : <p> Again , I 'm able to quickly find some strong keyword ideas within minutes : <p> Depending on your market , you might start with things like " how to start a business " , " how do I make " , " how to build " , " how to sing like " , etc . <h> Wrap Up <p> Hopefully , this has your wheels spinning a little bit . <p> If you 've tried suggestion tools before and did n't  get the best ideas , try it again with a slightly different approach . <p> Hello . Good post on finding long tail keywords . But does this keyword research really help in ranking high . I tried to include a few keywords from UberSuggest , but my rankings were no where to be found .

@@21641479 @1641479/ <h> Long Tail Pro vs . SECockpit Keyword Research Tool Comparision <h> Long Tail Pro vs . SECockpit <p> Were often asked about what the differences are between- Long Tail Pro and other leading keyword tools on the market . Often- there are some similarities in the functionality , but there are also quite a few key differences . Here is a breakdown of Long Tail Pro vs . SECockpit : <h> Keyword Tool Basics <p> The fundamental concept behind long tail keywords is finding keywords that you can target with your content that are searched often enough , but also have relatively low competition . The idea is finding that sweet spot so you can put together a well-optimized page targeting that keyword , and have a strong chance of moving up to the first page of Google for that search term . <p> So at a basic level , a keyword research tool should help you find keyword ideas , see how often it is searched , and then analyze the competition for that keyword . <p> As it sounds , this can be a somewhat time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of keywords. - So one of the keys to selecting a keyword research tool is finding one that- saves you time and does what you need at a price you can afford . <p> Kind of like when you buy a car , you have choices from a used Ford Fiesta all the way to a brand new Cadillac Escalade . <p> Similarly with keyword research , there are some things you can do for free and there are some tools that are very expensive and are loaded with features that frankly , not everyone needs . <p> So it is with Long Tail Pro and SECockpit they have quite a bit in common , but they also have differences in price , features , and who they target with their packages . ( i.e. are you a one-man niche site builder or a full-fledged SEO agency ? ) <p> That said , let 's look at some of the similarities and differences between Long Tail Pro and SECockpit . <h> Price- Comparison <p> Long Tail Pro and SECockpit are positioned differently in the keyword research software market based on price @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the ability to white label the software which is something Long Tail Pro does n't  do . <p> At the time of this writing , SECockpit has 3 different pricing options $339 per year , $599 per year , and $899 per year . They also give monthly alternatives to these plans as you can see below : <p> The main variables in pricing are the number of keyword searches you can do per day , and the higher priced plans come with additional features like related keywords/Google suggestions and the ability to do project management and keyword tracking . <p> The biggest features in Platinum are the keyword competitiveness calculation , which gives you a numeric score on how difficult a keyword would be to rank for on a scale of 1 100 , and a " favorites " tool which let 's you save and track your keywords inside of the software . <p> In both the standard " Pro " version , and the enhanced " Platinum " version , there are no limits on the number of keyword searches you can do per day . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you are n't  happy with the purchase you can get your money back . This lasts 30 days for SECockpit and 60 days for Long Tail Pro . In either case , you will likely know within just a few days if a particular solution is going to work for you . <h> Long Tail Pro and SECockpit Similarities <p> As you might imagine , 2 tools that do the same basic thing keyword research are going to have some similarities . Here is a quick rundown of some of the things that Long Tail Pro and SECockpit have in common , although the features may not look exactly the same in each product . <p> 1 . The main data sources are Google Keyword Planner and Moz. - Google provides the data on how often a keyword is searched on average , and the information about the average cost per click which is helpful if you are building a site that you plan to make money from Adsense . This is a rough idea of how much advertisers are paying per click on that search term . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the competition analysis . 2 of the really important numbers you 'll see from Moz are Page Authority and Domain Authority . <p> Here is how Moz explains the idea of domain authority ( DA ) . By combining all the link metrics they track , it is their indication of a domains chances of ranking well in search and generally tracking the strength of that site over time . So the higher your DA , the bigger authority you have . Page authority is the same concept , but it is at the page level . Page authority may be even more important- for our purposes because it is that specific page you are competing against , not necessarily the domain as a whole . <p> When you click on a keyword for detailed analysis in Long Tail Pro or in SECockpit , the layout and data you see is very similar . Notice that PA , DA , and back links to the page are included , as well as some additional data . Here is a look at Content Writing Jobs in SECockpit : <p> Here is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ analysis screen : <p> 2 . Built-in Filtering. - " Filtering " simply means that you are able to customize your search by saying that you only want keywords that get searched at least 1,000 times per month , for instance . <p> Other filters might be to only include keywords that have a specific word in them , and exclude all others . <p> Both tools have a filtering ability . <p> In Long Tail Pro , you select filters as part of the first step before keywords are generated . Most of the filtering in SECockpit is done after you search , by clicking on the column you want to filter on- and then inputting your filter criteria . <p> 3 . Keyword Competitiveness Rating. - Both Long Tail Pro and SECockpit have a tool to help you understand how likely you are to rank for a keyword . To be clear , the keyword competitiveness ( KC ) numeric score is only available with the Long Tail Platinum subscription . <p> In the standard Pro version , which is the one-time $97 fee , you have the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is n't done for you . <p> SECockpit also has a numeric competition rank , which is on a scale of 1 10 . It shows an orange bar in your search results to give you an idea of how difficult it would be to rank for that keyword as shown below : <h> Long Tail Pro and SECockpit Differences <p> While there are quite a few similarities between these 2 keyword research tools , there are also a number of differences . - While this probably is n't an exhaustive list , here are some differences you may notice : <p> 1 . Installation/Setup process. - Long Tail Pro is run on Adobe Air and can be downloaded and installed on a Mac or a PC. - SECockpit also works on those operating systems and is web-based meaning you work from your internet browser and not an installed software . <p> 2 . Using Google Suggestions. - Google suggestions are what you see when you start typing something into their search engine and they try to guess what you are looking for based on past searches or other factors . While @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Planner , SECockpit has some built in ability to expand your list using Google Suggestions . <p> To give you a better idea , check out the free tool Ubersuggest- which does this for you . You type in your keyword , and it will pull all the Google suggestions that you can download. - Its certainly a nice feature of SECockpit . <p> We generally recommend to start your keyword research by doing some pretty extensive brainstorming so you can discover keywords that you may have not seen before . To do that , we use a number of free tools like Ubersuggest , Amazon , and other places online to learn what your niche is searching for. - Click here to see how we did this step by step to find a great keyword in the nutrition niche . <p> 3 . Pricing and Free Trial. - This was covered extensively early in the article , but in the end its a big difference in the 2 products and in some ways a difference in who might use them . <p> For instance , Long Tail Pro is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unlimited access to the features available in that package . For example , - if you are a- niche site builder , you could pay $97 one time and have unlimited keyword searches in- a very good keyword tool . <p> SECockpit is a different model , with a yearly or monthly subscription that starts with limited functionality and 10 searches per day , and works its way up to an " Agency " package which can be white labeled for use by an SEO agency . <p> For a niche site builder example , your base level would be $339 per year for 10 keyword searches per day and lack some of the cool features like Google Suggest and the keyword tracker.

While there are tons of different ways to drive traffic to your website , today were going to focus on increasing your organic , search engine traffic by following a few practical steps . <p> Our guide to Bigcommerce SEO will walk you through the ideal setup and strategy to get more organic visitors to your Bigcommerce store . <h> Quick Intro To SEO <p> Let 's set the table by clarifying what we mean by " SEO . " <p> SEO is n't the Staples Easy Button <p> Many people talk about SEO like its a Staples Easy Button that you push and BOOM you get more traffic from the search engines . <p> If that 's what you 're thinking , I 've got some bad news : <p> Its not that easy . <p> However , that is actually- good news for you ! Like I 'm sure you 've heard before , if it were easy then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that while SEO is n't like pushing a magic button , it also is n't difficult to implement a winning SEO strategy for your Bigcommerce- website . You simply need a solid- plan that you can follow consistently . <p> If you 're starting at the beginning , " SEO " simply stands for search engine optimization . To put it plainly , it is a set of- actions you can take to make your website perform as well as possible in the Google search results . These " actions " consist of both things you can do on your website ( on-page SEO ) and off your website ( off-page SEO ) . <p> The most common form of off-page SEO is getting backlinks to your website from other high quality websites . You can read more about that here. - Today I 'll spend most of our time talking about on-page SEO that you can do with Bigcommerce . After all , the process of off-page SEO does n't  change much if you are using Bigcommerce , Shopify , WordPress , or any other website builder . <h> A Winning Bigcommerce SEO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " winning " SEO strategy for your site . Ideally this would be a blueprint that you understand and feel comfortable implementing and maintaining . <p> The strategy well cover is very much- a project that you can do yourself without any special technical knowledge . However , if you are considering outsourcing your SEO , check out this guide- to the 7 questions you should ask before hiring someone . <p> A " keyword " is simply a word or phrase that someone searches in Google ( or any other search engine ) . A long tail keyword is also something that gets searched , but " long tail " means that the keyword is more specific in nature , and- generally is n't searched all that often . <p> here 's an example : - <p> Let 's assume you sell health food or nutritional products of some kind . " Gluten free " might be a keyword that youd like to rank for . However , " gluten free " is very much a " short tail , " generic keyword . Its also SUPER competitive meaning that your site @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people search " gluten free . " <p> Here is a look at the competitive analysis for " gluten free " in our software , Long Tail Pro . <p> At the very top , we see that this searched 74,000 times per month and that the average keyword competitiveness is 60 which is extremely- competitive . <p> On the other hand , here is a long tail keyword that still fits into the " gluten free " category . Check out " gluten free snacks for kids : " <p> This search is much more specific in nature making it a long tail keyword . <p> While someone searching for " gluten free " could be looking for a variety of things , like a definition of the term , recipes , allergen info , etc. ; the person searching " gluten free recipes for kids " has pretty clearly defined exactly what they are looking for . <p> Notice that this is searched 1,300 times per month and has an average KC score of 22 meaning that you 'd have a much better shot of ranking in the top @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what long tail keywords are , let 's discuss how this can drive your Bigcommerce SEO strategy . <p> As illustrated above , the mistake that many people make when starting out is not doing any keyword research at all let alone effective keyword research . <p> The result is that people target keywords that are way too competitive with their content , or perhaps target no keywords at all . <p> So before we cover the specifics of on-page SEO in Bigcommerce , you need to understand that on-page SEO is almost pointless when you do n't  have a keyword , or set of keywords that you are targeting with your page or blog post . <p> Okay Ill move on now <p> To close out- our earlier example , the nutrition store would be wise to create a page full of gluten free recipes for kids since that keyword is being searched by many of their target customers and has low competition . Even if they do n't  sell gluten free snacks directly , they can still gain authority in their niche and use this page to link to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ setup the basic foundation of your website , you should start seeking out low competition long tail keywords in your industry or niche . Start compiling a list of these keywords and then consistently create content that specifically addresses one of the low competition keywords in your space . <p> While you wont start ranking overnight , by consistently following this strategy of targeting the low hanging fruit first you 'll be ahead of many of your competitors . As the weeks and months roll by , you 'll also start to see your number of organic visitors rising . Best of all , since those visitors are coming to your site from a specific , long tail keyword theyll likely- be close to making a buying decision . <p> Now that we 've given an overview of a winning strategy , let 's look at the nitty gritty of what you need to do in Bigcommerce to execute on this plan : <h> First Things First <p> One of the first things you should do after creating your Bigcommerce site is submit your sitemap to Google . Google can still find your site @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a road map that helps the search engines understand the structure of your website . <p> 5 . Type xmlsitemap.php into the blank box , then click the Submit Sitemap button . <p> 6 . You will see a success message indicating your sitemap has been submitted . <p> Here is a video that explains the basics of submitting your sitemap as well : <p> Once you 've submitted your sitemap , you 're done with the first step . Google now has all that it needs to understand and index your website appropriately . <h> Implementing Your Keyword Strategy in Bigcommerce <p> Weve covered why it is critical to target the right keywords with your content . Now let 's look at how you can target your keywords by doing effective on-page SEO in Bigcommerce . <h> Optimizing Bigcommerce Web Pages <p> Under " content " in your admin panel , go to " web pages " to see your list of existing pages . If you 've had Bigcommerce for awhile , it might make sense to go back and tweak some SEO settings after reading this . However , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to start from scratch . <p> Bigcommerce uses a WYSIWYG style editor for its pages and blog posts . Click here for more general information on how to work with the page editor . <p> The first thing you should do is setup your page name- and URL . <p> Its important to include your exact keyword in the page name , as this is one of the most important places that Google checks to understand what your page is about . <p> Ill use my example from earlier , " gluten free recipes for kids " and show you how to optimize a page for this keyword in Bigcommerce : <p> Notice that the page name is n't usually " just " the keyword and that 's all . You want to write a compelling title that includes your keyword , but also makes people want to click on your page . After all , Google displays 10 results on each page and you are competing against 9 other sites for the attention of that searcher . <p> By default , Bigcommerce will make the page URL be the same thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing , but sometimes your title makes for a really long URL . Its better to have concise URLS that are easy to read and share . If you can be concise and include part ( or all ) of your keyword even better ! <p> In my case , the URL of my page will be " **43;249;TOOLONG " <p> Next , scroll down to " Advanced Options " and specify your page title and description : <p> In case you are wondering , if you do n't  specify a page title in Bigcommerces advanced options , they will use your page name as the title for SEO purposes . There are times where you may want a little longer page title for SEO purposes than youd actually want to display on your site . The advanced settings are your opportunity to do that . <p> I simply stuck with my page name as my SEO page title . <p> Since it is cutoff in the screenshot , my full meta description is " Need a quick gluten free dinner idea ? Try these simple , delicious gluten free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leftovers ! " <p> The meta keywords no longer matter for search , so you do n't  need to waste time with this . <p> IMPORTANT : Notice that both my page title and page description include my primary keyword target in a natural and compelling way . <p> After I 've set my title , URL , and meta description there are just a couple of other things I would do in the content of my page : <h> Optimizing Bigcommerce Blog Posts <p> The same " best practices " we talked about with pages are also true for blog posts . <p> No need to restate everything . <p> However , the process is slightly different so it is worth showing how to optimize Bigcommerce blog posts . First , you 'll set the blog post title , which also serves as your page title in search . There is no option to give a different SEO title like we saw with pages : <p> Under " SEO ( optional ) " you 'll find a place to add your meta description and specify your URL . You should n't treat these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your URL is concise and your description is enticing and includes your target keyword : <h> Homepage SEO <p> While this may seem a little out of order , I thought it might help to provide all the context around what makes for a solid page title , description , etc. before talking about your home page . <p> The same rules generally apply here , but just remember that Google ranks pages and not websites . <p> Referring again to our example , I would have a page dedicated to the keyword " gluten free recipes for kids " and expect that page to rank in Google for people searching that specific keyword . I would n't really expect my stores homepage to rank highly for that long tail keyword . <p> So while there may be some keywords that youd like your home page to rank for , do n't  lose your common sense and get crazy trying to stuff your homepage with keywords . <p> Stick to your brand name and the basics when it comes to your home page . If you were the owner of Jakes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be " Jakes Natural Foods Cincinnatis Neighborhood Health Food Store . " <p> To setup your homepages title and description , look under " Settings " and then " Store Settings . " In the first menu of " Website Settings " you 'll see the SEO section as you scroll down . Simply enter your desired page title and description : <p> Notice that the home page title is whatever you provided as a store name nothing more . Also , your meta description is non-existent which means it will be somewhat randomly selected by the search engines . <p> Make sure you specify both of these items so you can control what people see when they search your brand . <h> SEO for Bigcommerce- Product Categories <p> In Bigcommerce , you have the ability to create and manage " product categories . " <p> As it sounds , this allows you to manually group sets of products together in a category that makes sense for your customer . <p> On the SEO side of things , Bigcommerces product categories present a nice opportunity to optimize for things that your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Long Tail Pro , you 'll likely discover that your customers are giving you category ideas ! <p> For instance , people could be searching for " Best Laptops Under $500 . " <p> If you sell laptops , why not make a category that helps those people find what they are looking for ? <p> Besides just adding the products , you can also use the content of the page to do a write up on the pros and cons of laptops at this price point , discuss common questions , etc. so you have a complete buying guide for that customer . <p> Along with the helpful content , you can also use- Bigcommerce to display the products in your store which fit that category so people can get more information and make a purchase all in one place . <p> As for SEO , setting up a page category is exactly the same as what we showed earlier with standard web pages . The difference is a shift in mentality for you , and being open to sorting your products in a way that your customers are searching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ categories , be sure to review Bigcommerces guide to controlling your sites navigation menu . You definitely do n't  want a navigation menu that is overwhelming and difficult to use . By default , your categories get added to your navigation menu and if you have dozens of categories you wo n't want them all to be in the main site navigation <h> A Quick Word About Product SEO <p> Weve covered page titles , meta descriptions , URLS and more in the previous sections . The same principles hold true for your product pages . <p> The SEO settings when adding a new product page are n't  obvious , so do n't  forget them ! <p> When you add a product , you 'll find SEO options about half way down the page under " Other Details . " <p> The only point I 'll add for product SEO is to use your SEO title and description to add some descriptors to your products . If you are selling a deck of playing cards , do n't  just make the SEO title of that product " Deck of 52 Playing Cards . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ describe the cards , that someone may be searching for in Google . Obviously you shouldnt be dishonest here , saying that your product is something that its not . However , you should be descriptive ! <p> What might someone be searching for when they want to buy a product like this ? <p> Maybe the SEO title for your product could be " Collectible American Flag Playing Cards Made in USA . " Then in your SEO meta description , go into more detail about your " patriotic " playing cards , what they 're made of , etc . <p> This is a simple step to take , but it gives you a chance to pull in traffic from people who are searching for very specific kinds of playing cards , like those with American flags on them or people looking for patriotic cards . <p> The key thing to note is that if you add your product with a very generic SEO title and description , then your odds of pulling in some of that very long tail traffic are very slim because you have n't differentiated your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? <p> Hopefully at this point you agree that doing common sense SEO for your Bigcommerce store is n't hard , but it does take some time for planning and execution . <p> The good news is , most people do n't  take the time to do the things weve covered in this article . So if you 'll take the time to find the best keywords , cover your bases with SEO on pages , blog posts , and products you 'll have a leg up on many of your competitors ! <p> If you 're still in the research phase on Bigcommerce , I 'd encourage you to start your 15 day free trial to see if its right for you . <p> Hi , we use Bigcommerce for our store .

Or does that not really matter too much ? <p> Hi Colin I do n't  think it matters all that much , but I do like the idea of creating category pages ( could even be just a custom-made page ) where you make categories based on keyword ideas . For instance , if you find out there are good keywords like " Best Widgets Under $500 " then I 'd create a page focused on that which has a mix of written content and a list of products that fit that criteria .

@@21641499 @1641499/ <p> If you 're just getting started with a website for yourself or for your business , youve likely heard the term " SEO . " <p> But what does SEO mean , anyway ? <p> First , do n't  feel bad for not knowing ! There are so many acronyms and terms thrown around that it is nearly impossible to keep up with them all especially if your focus- is running other parts of your business or organization . <p> You realize that you should probably know what " SEO " is and being doing something about it , but who has the time ? <p> here 's our attempt to break down everything you need to know about SEO : <h> What Does SEO Stand For ? <p> SEO stands for " search engine optimization . " <p> To break it down further , a search engine is simply a site like Google , Yahoo , or Bing where people go and search for things like " chicken casserole recipes " or " how to fix a flat tire . " Honestly the list of things people search for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ searches per DAY . <p> So search engine optimization is the process of- setting your website up in a way that makes it easy to find on Google . You are basically trying to put your " best foot forward " so Google knows what your website is about , and it knows that your website is a high quality resource in your industry . <p> There 's more to it than that , but I think that gives us a nice platform to build from . <h> How Does SEO Work ? <p> As mentioned , there are a few major search engines , and then a bunch of smaller search engines . For our purposes , well use " Google " - and- " search engine " interchangeably for the rest of this article . At this point , Google is the king of search engines with over 60% of all searches being done- their site . <p> Google has a sophisticated and secretive algorithm that determines what results you get when you search for something . <p> Although some conspiracies exist to the contrary , the goal of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see and then delivery the best , high quality results for that search query . <p> How is that done ? <p> If you 'd like to take a look at Brian Deans best guess at all 200 factors that Google looks at , be my guest . However , you can do a lot of damage ( in a good way ) by concentrating on just a few key basics of how SEO works . <p> After all , understanding and nailing the fundamentals will likely put you a step ahead of most of your competition . So its best to not let yourself get bogged down and overwhelmed by all the nuances of SEO . <h> What Is A Keyword ? <p> This is an important point to understand before we go any further . <p> Like " SEO , " you may have also heard the term " keyword " be thrown around in blogging and internet marketing discussions . <p> A keyword is simply a word or phrase that gets searched in Google . <p> Earlier I gave " chicken casserole recipes " as an example of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a keyword . So when you hear things like " optimizing for this keyword " it simply means that you are trying to make a page on your website as effective as possible in ranking for a specific search phrase . <p> Well talk more about keywords later , but I wanted to define it now because- its important in understanding what you should be doing with your website from an SEO perspective . If you need further explantation before moving on , check out this post where we define what a keyword is . <h> On-Page SEO <p> On-page SEO refers to the things that you control on your web page , which help Google understand what that page is about . <p> You could have a great resource or a really in-depth guide on your website , but if you are missing the boat with on-page SEO then it probably is n't being found in Google as much as it should be . <p> Here- is where " keywords " become important . <p> If you have no idea what people are searching for on Google , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be " optimizing " for ? - <p> Exactly . <p> Keyword research , which well cover in the next section , is the process of finding out what people are searching for and knowing what you should be trying to target with the pages on your website . <p> Why does this matter ? <p> Because in order to do good " on-page SEO " you need to know the keywords you are targeting . <p> Trying to do on-page SEO without knowing your keyword would be like me telling you to decorate your house for a birthday party , but not telling you who the party was for . <p> Should you decorate for a 4 year old boy who loves Jake and the Neverland Pirates ? <p> or for an " over the hill " party for a man turning 40 ? <p> You could spend a week turning your house into a real-life pirate ship , but if the target was for a 40 year old man you would have completely missed the mark . <p> So once you know the keyword you want a certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few things on your page : <p> 1 . You need to include the keyword in the title of the page . If " Ab Workouts " is- my keyword , then my page title might be something like " 36 Ab Workouts That Get Killer Results . " <p> 2 . Your page description should also include the exact keyword . The page title and description are the 2 things you see in the search results , so its important that these 2 things clearly state your keyword so Google knows what you 're page is about . <p> 3 . The URL should contain the keyword , or some form of it . Let 's say my website is called " www.theworkoutguru.com " then my post about ab workouts might be " **34;323;TOOLONG " . If your page URLs look more like " **28;359;TOOLONG " then you are missing an opportunity . <p> 4 . Use the keyword and variations of it throughout the content on the page . So I 'd expect " ab workouts " to be mentioned in the first paragraph , and then again a few times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no certain number of times needed , but make a point to use the keyword naturally as this also helps Google understand what your page is about . <p> These are the pillars of on-page SEO , - and doing them well will put you ahead of most of your competition . That said , here are a couple more resources about on-page SEO that you can bookmark for later : <p> If you are a WordPress user , there is a free plug-in known as SEO by Yoast which makes on-page SEO much easier . It allows you to input your target keyword and then will point out how well you did at optimizing for that keyword , including all 4 of the things we listed above . <p> In fact , here is a video showing exactly how it works : <h> How To Research Keywords <p> Hopefully at this point , you are starting to understand what SEO is and some basic things you can do on your website to optimize pages for the search engines . <p> You should also understand what a keyword is , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for is vital . <p> Now the question is , how do you know what keywords you should be targeting ? <p> Keyword research is the process by which you can find out how often a particular phrase is searched , and understand just how stiff the competition is for that keyword . <p> Let 's say you own an online store that sells hardware and tools . <p> Your first thought is that " tool sets " should be the keyword that I try to rank for . <p> Of course that would be nice to land your tool shop on page 1 of Google when someone searches " tool sets . " <p> But is it practical ? <p> For a small website or business , probably not . Just look at the competition when you search for " tool sets " in Google : <p> I see brands like : Home Depot , Amazon , Sears , and other giants of the hardware industry . <p> The better bet for " mom and pop " businesses and websites is to instead focus on what are commonly called " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , more specific searches that get searched less often , and generally have lesser competition . In other words , they 're keywords that you can focus on- with your SEO and actually have a chance of ranking highly for in Google . <p> Going back to our example , a better keyword for you to target might be " best cordless hammer drill . " <p> Why ? <p> After all , certainly this phrase is searched much less often than the more general " tool set . " Shouldnt you be going after the one that gets searched more often ? <p> Not necessarily . <p> " best cordless hammer drill " gets searched about 210 times per month in Google , but the competition is much lower . Here is a look at the first page of Google : <p> Notice sites like CopTool.com , Toolguyd.com , and Protoolreviews.com all in the top 5 . <p> I 'm not knocking those sites , but they certainly are n't  titans of the industry like Lowes , Home Depot , and Sears . <p> The key here is that these sites @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Notice titles like " Best Cordless Drills 2014 " and " Cordless Hammer Drill Round-up " that do a good job with targeting this type of keyword . <p> Finding a number of similar " long tail " keywords would be a great place for a small online tool store to start . <p> How do- I get started ? <p> The quickest way to get started with keyword research is to use a tool like Long Tail Pro that does most of the work for you . You can put in some " seed keywords " and then the program will generate hundreds of similar keyword ideas , tell you how often they are searched , and then analyze your competition so you know if it is a good keyword to target . <p> If you 're ready to try it out , click the button below to begin a free trial of Long Tail Pro : <h> Do Links To Your Site Matter ? <p> Yes . <p> You 'll find some debate about this online , but other sites putting links to your site is definitely an important factor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really . <p> A link back to your site ( AKA a " backlink " ) is something like a vote of confidence for you in the eyes of Google . Imagine if you were quoted in a story for the New York Times and when they posted the story online , they linked to your website in the article . <p> Search engines like Google understand authority , and sites do n't  get much more trusted and authoritative than the New York Times . So the idea is that if the New York Times puts a backlink to your site , you must have a site that is somewhat important and high quality . <p> If you went on to get more links like this from respected organizations or " authorities " in your industry , it would be an even greater indication to Google that your site must be important and it must be pretty good ( or all of these high quality sites would n't be linking to it ) . So in a way , they are transferring a bit of authority to you . <p> So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> If you have 1,000 links to your site but they all come from irrelevant , low quality websites it may actually be a bad thing for your website . So all backlinks are not created equal . <p> Not even close . <h> How to Get Backlinks <p> So how do you get quality and authoritative backlinks to your website ? <p> This is one of those topics that can quickly become overwhelming , so were going to stick to just a few practical tips on how to get backlinks that- almost anyone can implement right away . <p> 1. - Here is a good one to start with from BrightEdge.com- on the power of leveraging the people you already do business with : <p> 2. - Expert " round-up " posts are another great way to get a few backlinks and start getting traffic . The concept is that you think of some hot topic or interesting question in your industry and then reach out ( via email ) to experts in your space to ask them what they think . In the end , you 'll have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ audience . <p> Here is an example of a round-up post where 52 SEO experts gave their most creative link building tip . <p> The important thing to remember with a round-up post is to reach back out to everyone who contributed after you 've published it . Give them a heads up that the post is live , and thank them for sharing their insight . You can also politely welcome them to share your content if theyd like . <p> Many times your contributors will share the post on social media , and maybe even link to it from their site . <p> 3. - The third technique I 'll mention is doing some kind of " award " or " favorites " post on your site . <p> This works especially well for local businesses . <p> An example I 've used before is if you are a wedding photographer , make a list of " The Most Beautiful Wedding Venues in Cleveland " ( or whatever city you are located in . ) <p> Then , make a list ( ideally with pictures included ) and talk about your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Once you 've published it , simply send an email or call representatives from those venues and let them know about the " award " you 've given them . People love being mentioned on curated lists like this , and many times theyll gladly put a link to your list from their website which is great news for you . <p> 4. - Find things ( articles , lists , etc. ) that people already link to in your industry and make something better . Then , tell all the people linking to that other content about your much better resource . <p> Brian Dean coined the term " Skyscraper Technique " for this , because nobody cares about the 3rd tallest building in New York , we want to know which skyscraper is the tallest . This technique is very practical and makes a lot of sense . Watch how Brian explains it : <p> The list of linkbuilding tips could go on and on <p> and on <p> But doing just these 4 things will get you off to a fast start . <p> The key thing is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actually execute . Take just a couple of strategies that work for you and run with them . Depending on your niche , just a few high quality backlinks can make a HUGE impact for your SEO efforts . <h> Other Common SEO Questions <p> Hopefully what you 've read so far has helped simplify " SEO " for you . <p> Now I 'll take an opportunity to share some insights on other common questions about different types of SEO . <h> SEO Video Marketing <p> Youve probably noticed that some searches you do will pull back a bunch of videos in the results . Also , its fairly common to see videos embedded in blog posts on a given topic to help supplement the written content . <p> We 've already talked about backlinks , but adding video to your websites content can really help keep people around longer which is another good indication of the quality of your content . <p> If someone clicks on your page after a Google search and then hits the back button 5 seconds later , that is n't a good sign . That is called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " as mentioned in the image above . <p> On the other hand , if they stick around for a few minutes that means they were engaged in the content and demonstrates that people like what you have to offer , which increases their time on page and may even get them to go deeper into your website . <p> So adding video to your site is one way to reduce the number of people who come to your page and then bounce somewhere else . <p> As for posting videos to Youtube and having them rank in Google for different keywords , there are a few things you should know about doing proper SEO on those videos . This video- gives some advice on how to do video SEO the right way : <h> Local Business SEO Advice <p> If you are a local business , there are really a lot of advantages for you in the SEO world . As opposed to a company that is online only , you can really make some connections ( and probably already have them ) in your local community and get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best advice Ive seen for local business SEO comes from Marcus Sheridan . He actually mastered SEO while trying to grow his pool company , and found out what works in the real world . This video is chock full of actionable , simple advice for the local business owner : <h> Can You Outsource SEO ? <p> Technically , you can . <p> Perhaps the better question is " should I outsource SEO ? " <p> Check out this article about some of the dangers of outsourcing your SEO if this is something you are considering . <p> This is n't to say that their are n't  good SEO and marketing companies out there certainly there are . <p> However , SEO can be so critical for your success online that this decision is n't something you should make lightly . As the article points out , if you get connected with the wrong SEO company , it could very well have a negative impact on your website and business . <p> Shady tactics are often penalized by Google and can be a devastating blow to your search traffic . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here are some ideas of the questions you should ask and the answers you should hear . <p> Insourcing SEO <p> Marcus Sheridan in the video above has talked about the concept of " insourcing " your SEO by getting your staff to help with content creation . As we discussed , keyword research and creating great content are 2 important parts of a good SEO strategy . <p> Who knows your business better than you and your staff ? <p> Sharing your expertise on a topic that your customers are asking about via your website is a great way to start drawing people into your website . In fact , Marcus always talks about the idea of " they ask , you answer " which means if you hear a question from a customer , you should answer that question in a general way on your blog . <p> So if you can get buy-in from your staff , you 'll likely have no shortage of ideas for blog posts you could add that would be answering the most common questions you hear about your product , service , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ option if your budget is tight ! <h> Wrap Up <p> If you 've made it this far , hopefully you feel comfortable with some of the basics of SEO ! <p> If your business is n't putting much into your online SEO efforts today , the best thing you can do is get started . I 'd suggest starting with keyword research to figure out what you should blog about , then create really helpful content on those topics . <p> Next , work on one or two of the simple backlinking strategies we discussed and you 'll start to pick up some momentum .

I use to do all of my keyword research manually with a lot of free site investigating to get it all done . My son loves it too .. I can always get my money back , but I can never get back the timeThanks you sooooo much for Long Tail Pro . It has saved me time , money , energy and stress and is making me more money . I was going to get Market Samurai , but it was too complicated for non-techi people like me . The learning curve was a little too much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kid can do it . <p> Thanks Spenceryoure the best <p> Elon Bomani , TX <p> Luv it ! Ive been part of the beta testers of LTP and I must say that this is a great program if you really value your time . The program is fast and effective and I have actually started several websites ( which are already earning a few dollars here and there ) based on keyword research done using this program . <p> I just bought LTP . I thought I already had a solid KW approach , however after using LTP , its extremely less hassle . <p> Just think of keywords , input your criteria . Go for gold . <p> No more importing , exporting out of google adwords with all those long named CSV files . <p> + the projects organised on the side bar is simple and clear . J <p> Great work Spencer ! <p> MUCH Appreciated . Young Lee <p> Not only is Long Tail Pro my number one niche research software , its my " go to " application before I write any individual articles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traffic from long tail keywords that I would not have otherwise discovered . More traffic has meant more earnings . Steve S. <p> As I would like to categorize myself as a newbie in this field , I would like to provide a review of Long Tail Pro in a Newbies point of view <p> Intallation : This is very easy and straight forward , I also got the update last night and it was fast as well . <p> User Interface : I like the interface overall , things are easy to find . Even without reading the manual that was included in the installation , I was able to create my first campaign without a problem . I was able to search for some keywords , export to a csv file all in under 5 minutes on my first try ! <p> I tried LTP on both my laptop and desktop ( more powerful ) and researched on the same keyword . <p> I like the fact that it can check domain name availability Even researching for a very vague keyword , LTP still returns results on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can set min and max global/local search , domain availability and min/max CPC -I like the competitor analysis , it gives me very good information of the top 10 sites for the keywords you are analyzing . <p> Overall , I like it ! <p> I am very satisfied with this tool and to tell you honestly , I am kinda addicted to it now . lol " Lemmohr <p> " Hi <p> I have used this software it is very good . " Lewis <p> " I purchased this Software yesterday and I found few gold nuggets in a short time . Software processing is pretty fast and that " domain availability " feature is handy . " TrafficWiz <p> " So I opened LTP today and see we now have a new version . Let me be the first to say Awesome update ! For those considering buying , you can now click the keyword and jump directly to the competition tab ( HUGE time saver ) . I am still getting the hang of using LTP but so far , I 'm very happy ! " Khundawg <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through it now as well as using the competition analysis and rank tracking features , and let me just say this : <p> I have been building niche websites for a couple of years now and keywords are the foundation of this business . In my quest to find those perfect " golden nugget " keywords I have literally used every keyword research program on the market today and most online keyword research services , none of those other tools have not been as fast or as efficient as Long Tail Pro . Most other tools on the market limit you to the amount of data that you can analyze , or they take forever to load the data for those keywords , but Long Tail Pro seems to be running in overdrive . In less than a minute I can pull every single factor that I need to look at to make an informed decision as to whether a keyword is worth my time , it tells me if exact match domains are available and shows me the average cpc at a glance so that I have a much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . <p> I have n't even mentioned the built-in Rank Checker ! That alone allows me to cancel my $50/month subscription to my current rank tracking service and best of all , when I target a new keyword I just plug it right in to the software and everything for that new project is there in front of me . <p> What makes me even more comfortable with this program is that it was developed by someone that has built a small empire around niche websites . I have talked to Spencer on a personal level , I know that he is involved in this business and I know that he uses Long Tail Pro to build on his success . Why is that important to me ? Because that means that Long Tail Pro was created with everything a niche marketer needs to be successful ! " <p> On another note , I can not believe how fast this program runs ! When I was using Market Samurai , I could literally take a coffee break while the program was running , with Long Tail Pro , its done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lol I do n't  know how he made is run so fast , because it pulls all of the same data that you would see in most other programs , but it is quick , which means more time saved for me . <p> I just got the program today and already have a new list of 20 low competition keywords to go after , that is money in the bank for me . I believe this is a true contender for being the BEST keyword research and analysis tool on the market and that is not something I have ever said about any other program . " <p> Patric Hebert <p> " I have tried out Long Tail Pro ( LTP ) and here is my review . <p> LTP has 3 main functions : <p> Keyword Research Keyword Competition Analysis Rank Checker <p> Here are some of the outstanding features : <p> LTP has a very simple interface and it is very easy to use . you are able to enter multiple keywords at once ( preferably up to a maximum of 5 at any one time ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the keywords from Google Keyword Tool . you can filter your keywords based on broad phrase or exact match , the number of monthly local and global searches and average CPC with ease . the best part of LTP is that it is able to show you if the exact match or hyphenated domains ( . com , . net , . org , etc ) of the generated keywords are available . This feature alone is really a time saver . For those who want to build sniper sites , LTP will save you both time and effort . the Keyword Competition Analysis feature shows you all the important factors ( if keyword is in the meta Title and Description , number of backlinks to main domain and actual page , age of site , Page Rank , etc. ) for you to decide if your new sites will rank easily on the first page of search engines . if you want to check how your site is ranking for specific keywords , the Rank Checker feature will help you check up to 500 positions in Google , Yahoo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mouse . What a time saver ! <p> Overall , I really love LTP . I am extremely impressed with the speed it is able to gather all the important information I require to do a good keyword research . It helps me cut down my time and to decide quickly if I should build new sites on the newly found keywords . <p> Most importantly , this software is developed and being used by a user who has already achieve great success in monetizing his hundreds of sites . I am assured he will constantly update LTP and make it even better . " <p> Sylvestian Yap <p> Well , I was just soooo excited that this tool works on my Mac that I kept using it over and over . Thanks so very much ! I love this tool !

@@21641501 @1641501/ <h> Long Tail Pro and the New Google Keyword Planner <p> As you are likely aware , Google has recently announced that they will phasing out the old Google Keyword Tool and moving to their new Keyword Planner Tool . <p> How will this change affect Long Tail Pro ? - This is exactly what I plan to cover in this post , along with some great updates that we 've made to the software in conjunction with this change . <p> I am happy to say that Long Tail Pro will continue to work with the new Keyword Planner tool ! - We have just released version 2.3.0 of the software , which now incorporates the change to the Keyword Planner. - So , if you havent had a chance yet , go ahead and open your copy of Long Tail Pro to get the automatic and free update to the latest version . Were committed to making sure that Long Tail Pro remains the leading keyword research software in the market . <h> What Stays the Same ? <p> The Google Keyword Planner still provides much of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact , most users will not notice any changes within Long Tail Pro. - You can still generate up to 800 keyword ideas for each seed keyword. - You can also still input multiple seed keywords at once , find exact match domains , and filter your results automatically based on what you want to see . <p> In addition to monthly search volumes for keywords , you will also continue to get Cost Per Click ( CPC ) data along with Advertiser competition data. - All the great data that you have become accustomed to , is still available in Long Tail Pro . <p> The Rank Tracker and Competitor Analysis are not affected at all with the changes. - They continue to function as they normally have . <h> What Changes ? <p> In addition to some of the changes brought about due to the new Google Keyword Planner tool , weve also made a number of improvements that we were unable to do before. - I am going to run through what is different now in Long Tail Pro . <h> Auto-Login to Google Adwords <p> You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " before generating keywords. - Instead , the software will detect if you are already logged into Google Adwords. - If not , you will automatically get a log in box pop-up ; where you can save your log in credentials ( if you want ) , so that you do n't  have to login in the future . <p> This is just a nice time saving feature , because you will have one less step if you chose to save your login credentials . <h> Long Tail Pro Just Got Faster ! <p> We take speed seriously around here at Long Tail Pro , and well , thanks to some performance improvements we 've made , you will notice that the fastest keyword research tool , just got faster ! <p> You can continue to search for multiple seed keywords and automatically filter , which have always been a big time saver ; but you will now notice that all of your keyword results will come back even faster. - Youre welcome . <h> Search Volumes Include Mobile and More <p> The new Keyword Planner now provides data for mobile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you could only select data for mobile devices separately. - As a result , the search volume you see in Long Tail Pro will be more accurate for how users are using Google now. - People are searching more and more on devices other than desktops and laptops ; so now you will see that data in Long Tail Pro . <p> As a result , if you compare the search volume in the old Google Keyword Tool with the new Keyword Planner , you will notice that the search volume is a bit higher in the Keyword Planner. - This is due to the fact that all devices are now covered . <p> We see this as a positive move towards more accurate information . <h> Include and Exclude Keywords <p> The new Keyword Planner has an option to " Only include keywords containing " the terms you input ; or to " Exclude keywords containing " any terms you input . <p> As a result , we 've added this feature to Long Tail Pro ! - Previously , there was essentially the " Include " feature in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is new for Long Tail Pro. - As you can see from the image below , you can simply input your Include or Exclude terms for each seed keyword . <p> If you leave them blank , Long Tail Pro will just generate 800 related keywords as it always has . <h> Exact Match Searches Only <p> I have always taught for a long time , that Exact match is the only search volume number that you should be looking at. - Previously , in the old Google Adwords Keyword tool , you could select Broad , Phrase , or Exact match. - However , the Keyword Planner displays only Exact match search volume . <p> As a result , there is no longer an option within Long Tail Pro to see Broad or Phrase match search volumes. - While we wished we could still show this data for those that wanted it ; we are happy that Google continues to show Exact match search volumes ; which we have always felt is the most important all along . <h> Local and Global Search Volume <p> So , the search @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " searches. - This means the search volume displayed is the amount of search occurring in whatever country you have selected in your campaign . <p> Despite the fact that I , and many others only care about Local searches ; we are well aware that some of you want a Global number. - As a result , we are working our programming magic to come up with a way to give you a Global search volume in addition to the default Local search volume on one screen . <p> We expect to be releasing an update in the near future that gives you an option to see Global numbers combined with Local search volume . <h> Advertiser Competition <p> The new Keyword Planner continues to provide Advertiser Competition ; however , it is only shown as Low , Medium , or High. - As a result , we can no longer display a number between 0 and 100 for advertiser competition. - So , while its not quite as accurate , you can still get a good idea of how many advertisers are bidding on a keyword with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Changes <p> Overall , weve also made some minor changes to the user interface to make the tool more efficient . <p> Finally , for this new version , we will be creating new tutorial videos that reflect what we have discussed here. - Those new tutorial videos and user manual are currently under production. - However , for those of you already using Long Tail Pro , you will be able to pick up the new version and continue finding great keywords like you always have . <p> Thanks Steve ! To clarify , you are not required to save your login details ; its optional . Second , if you do save you can clear that saved information by clicking " Settings " in the bottom left hand corner of the software . <p> This brings up a question : I have free trial of long tail pro . Ive been searching only on desktop and laptop . Should I also search on all mobile devices and add results ? I have n't seen this mentioned in your video etc. thanks <p> This brings up a question : I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ searching only on desktop and laptop . Should I also search on all mobile devices and add results ? I have n't seen this mentioned in your video etc. thanks <p> There is in fact an option to look at broad and phrase match options in the keyword planner , on the top right of the resulting keywords there is a pencil icon which let 's you choose between the options . <p> Actually , that pencil does not do what you think it does . Go ahead and try it yourself no matter what you select ; broad , phrase , or exact the " searches " column does not change . So , Google is not showing you search volumes for anything but exact match search volume . This option that you are seeing , allows you to add keywords to your " Ad Group " keyword plan in the match type you select . So , if you are doing a paid campaign ( PPC ) , you will be bidding on keywords in either broad , phrase , or exact match . I 'm not sure I explained it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it does n't  allow you to see search volume for different match types . <p> Again , try it for yourself and see . Also , Google has explicitly said that they do n't  provide historical search volume data for anything but exact match . Here is their official blog post mentioning this and more : LONG ... <p> Hey Joeglad you like the update ! Great to hear from power users like you = As always , we are always making improvements ; so , I 'll take a look into the feasibility of adding search volume trends . If its doablewell do it = <p> I had just logged in to ask you about the status of LTP , &amp; the new keyword planner . And , low &amp; behold , the answer was already waiting when I opened my mail . Havent saw the update yet , but I 'm sure its awesome . <p> Secondly , this new keyword tool has me a little boggled . I keep hearing that the search volume should be higher than the old tool because the new tool collects data from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ site based on a keyword that was getting 4400 exact match local searches ( with the old tool ) . The new tool shows only 1900 searches for the same keyword . <p> I 've tried to get info from Google , but the best Ive gotten is that its a technical issue they are aware of and they 're working on it . BUT , they say the results from the new tool are more accurate . I just do n't  understand why the number would be THAT much lower <p> Anyway , thanks for the update ! I notice that occasionally some of the " calculate " buttons are missing in the Avg KC columnany idea what causes that ? <p> Thanks Mohit for the help : ) . Rater-X , all I can say is that Google claims the data from the new keyword planner is more accurate . So , unfortunately your keyword may only be getting the 1900 searches per month shown . <p> Pratik : You can get global search volume in Long Tail Pro . Under " fetch additional data " , just select " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the country of your choice , and global search volume at the same time .

Don <p> Hey Stefan : The " Include " function is essentially the same thing . So , just input the phrase in the " Include " box to only display terms closely related . We had to remove that box , because of the changes Google made to their new planner ; but the function is still there . <p> Hi , just want to say that LTP just keeps getting better and better .

I have not used Long Tail ( I have the Lite version ) in month or so as I was busy working in markets that I had already established ( thanks to Long Tail ) but I was worried that the new Adwords planner would put an end to some of the features I love most about your product . However , I was wrong ! ! ! <p> To cut a long story , short I can not tell you how delighted I am that you guys are on the ball , and in my opinion have actually improved on what was already an stellar product .

I purchased your Long tail classroom tutorial set and I went through the specific video but you just say low page authority/low page links and do n't  assign a scale like you do when it comes to Keyword Competitiveness . <p> I am new to this and I have already purchased two of your products . I would be willing to upgrade to LT Platinum but I would like to get some value before I do . I would like to get a couple niche sites up and running and ranking before I commit to the 17/mo . <p> After doing some research , I found why this was happening . However I see here two big things that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> If I 'm not targeting any local country , in keyword planner I can remove all or remove any country simply and will show global searches , i.e. " All locations " . This can be achieved by checking " Global Search Volume " button I believe , HOWEVER , I 'm checking the additional filters for global search volume too , so by checking it , I 'm unable to achieve my desired results . I can simply not select " All locations " in new or edit campaign selection for country instead of choosing any country , which forces me to choose a country forcefully . In keyword tool , it was mandatory however in keyword planner , you can remove the country and search for all locations , that is how you get global searches . <p> I hope this fix can be done soon . <p> Honestly , I 'm superbly hating Google for removing the good old keyword tool . There 's an old saying which goes by " Why fix when its not broken ? " , Google did exactly that and I 'm sure many marketers are not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . However your efforts are truly appreciated Spencer ( yikes , I mistakenly said Stefan in last post , sorry for that ) . <p> Pratik : You can get global search volume in Long Tail Pro .

We only want to see what it would look like in its local market for those keywords . Any suggestions ?

He joined as the Marketing Manager and the company was getting about 500 visits a month to their website , and their site- wasnt generating much business at all . <p> Fast forward to today and Jonathan reports that they have " built a traffic flow that has grown 20-fold year over year and pipeline from Google organic search that has generated over $1 million USD in new business opportunities . " <p> That is an astounding rate of growth . <p> I asked Jonathan what some of the key things were when he first came in the door . What were the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ start building a foundation for a better inbound marketing strategy ? <p> Here are couple of the key things that he did to get started : <p> 1 . Find out what 's working and make it work better . <p> Jonathan tried to find out which pages on their site were ranking in Google for ANYTHING , and then optimize those pages to rank even higher . <p> After a few weeks , you 'll start to see some information like which websites link to yours and other helpful information . If you click on " Search Traffic " and then " Search Queries " you 'll see a list that looks something like this : <p> This is showing you different keywords that you are being seen for ( impressions ) in the Google search results . The " Avg. position " gives you an idea where you rank for that term . <p> So in this example , when someone searches for " Chase Field Parking " I am about the 11th result , meaning Im just outside of the first page . <p> That does n't  seem too bad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shows that the 11th position gets about 1% of the traffic ( 92% of people pick a result from the first page ) , you realize that you 've got some work to do . <p> What I would want to do is make sure the page ranking 11th is completely optimized for the term I 'm trying to rank for . If you are WordPress user , one simple way to make sure you are doing this is to install the SEO by Yoast plug-in . Its free and it guides you through the things you should be doing in each post to make sure you are optimized for the keyword you are targeting . <p> sunote <p> Here are 4- quick pointers to get you started : <p> ( The Yoast plug-in makes all of these very simple to do , and hard to forget ) <p> Make sure the title of your page has the exact keyword you want to rank higher for . <p> Make sure the page description is compelling , but also includes your exact keyword . <p> Mention your target keyword early in your post @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sense <p> When you add images , try to include the keyword in at least one of your ALT tags . <p> /sunote <p> So Jonathan basically came in the door and took what- was working a little bit and focused on making it the best it could be . The result was that pages that were " unintentionally " ranking for certain terms now had a focused effort on ranking for those terms . In turn , those pages started to move up the rankings and draw in more organic traffic . <p> 2 . Use " Newsjacking " In Your Blog Content. - <p> According to Corey Eridon- " Newsjacking refers to the practice of capitalizing on the popularity of a news story to amplify your sales and marketing success . " - <p> Here is an example of how Netrepid used newsjacking to increase their traffic : <p> In August 2013 , BlueHost had a pretty widely publicized outage of their servers . This meant than tons of websites were unavailable as a result . Since web hosting is part of what they do , Jonathan took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happened . <p> Beyond that , he went onto explain how the set up of their datacenter prevents these types of incidents and of course gave people the opportunity to get in touch ( just in case they were looking for a new host ! ) Jonathan used some basic optimization tips mentioned above and even though he published the article at 4 PM , that article brought in- more visits that day than they had ever had on a single day before . <p> sunote <p> Here are a couple of tips on newsjacking : <p> Keep it professional . Even though Jonathan was covering some " bad news " in the industry , he did n't  take shots at the- company having the issue . He simply explained the technical reasons of why it happened , and then explained how their structure is different . You definitely want to use newjacking to build trust and authority in your market not to come off like a jerk ! <p> Add something to the story. - Newsjacking is n't about reporting the news . People have CNN for that . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that makes it interesting for your audience . Making sense of- the details , talking about lessons learned , or some other differentiator that makes your version stand out amongst the rest . <p> /sunote <h> 2 . Find What to Write About <p> Once youve optimized and cleaned up any existing issues with your site , the next thing to tackle is " what in the world am I going to write about ? " <p> After all , if you 're going to have a successful inbound marketing strategy then you need to know what your potential customers want to know . Often , the answer to this question is right in front of your face . <p> What do I mean ? <p> You certainly get asked questions all the time about your prices , your service , your opinions on different products , etc . Why not address those questions in a set of blog posts on your website ? <p> Marcus Sheridan is someone I love to listen to when it comes to this topic because he did it in his own swimming pool company , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Here is Marcus talking about " They ask , you answer . " <p> So when figuring out what to write about , start by jotting down all the questions you hear from customers over the course of your day . Have your employees do the same thing and before you know it , you 'll have a pretty long list of things you can add to your website . <p> After all , if people are asking you these questions then you can bet many more people are going to Google to ask the same question . <p> In March of 2013 he decided to get serious about inbound marketing for his English language instruction service and scrapped every " lame " blog post on their site . From that point forward theyve added only content that is both detailed and in-depth . <p> I asked Marc how they came up with ideas for what to write about . <p> The first thing he said was that they were based on questions they had been asked by people who visited the website . What a concept ! <p> Did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were averaging about 6,000 visitors per month on their site . Today that number has nearly tripled to about 16,000 per month . <p> Traffic is great , but what about sales ? <p> Marc reports that with the increased traffic , sales have " increased dramatically " over that same time period . <h> Keyword Research <p> Another great step in figuring out where to start with your inbound marketing efforts , and particularly your own blog content , is by doing keyword research . If this concept is new to you , check out this guide to learning what a keyword actually means for your business . <p> The idea here is to learn what people are searching for in Google most often , and then analyzing what the results are to see if you might be able to rank near the top for that " keyword . " <p> One of the quickest and most effective approaches is to focus on what we call " long tail keywords " which are generally searches that are more specific and often do n't  have many great results focused on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ post that addresses that keyword , you 'll have a much better shot of being found . <p> An example might be " Dogs " as a very short tail , generic keyword . You 'll probably never make it to page 1 of Google for " Dogs . " A long tail example would be " how to breed poodles. " - On the surface you would have a much better chance of ranking highly for that search term if you write " The Complete Guide For How To Breed Poodles " and give all the information the searcher may want to know . <p> sunote <p> Finding long tail keywords that you can compete for can be hard , but Long Tail Pro saves you time and helps you find the best keywords for your business . Click here to try it for free ( no credit card required ) . <p> /sunote <h> 3 . Create Content That Deserves To Rank <p> Even if you are using Long Tail Pro to find great keywords , you still have to deliver the goods . <p> Your blog post , video @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are using needs to be great . It should " deserve " to rank at the top of Google because it is the best resource available . As Julie Joyce said in a recent interview " Stop bloating up sites with thin crap . " <p> So if you are going to make something , take the time to make it the best it can be . <p> The bad news is , it takes time and effort to create great stuff . <p> However , that is also the good news . <p> Its good because so many of your competitors wont take the time to do it , so if you really knock it out of the park with your content you can make a huge impact on your business . <p> David Waring at FitsSmallBusiness.com- knew that writing about small business loans and services was a competitive space , so they invested heavily in creating top-notch content . He said " we spend days and sometimes weeks researching and writing our articles . " <p> That 's not easy , but it has certainly paid off . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the last 12 months . <p> One example of an article that has done well attracting- organic traffic is their guide to SBA loan rates . As you might imagine , the Small Business Administrations own site ranks very highly for all things " SBA " , but David knew there were still opportunities to pull in traffic from certain long tail keywords . <p> David always starts his blog content with a simple question : - " What would a person coming to the page want to know ? " <p> In this case , they covered all the basics of an SBA loan but then went above and beyond to talk about how the rates are determined , what might make them change , and in the end they had created a comprehensive guide that most of their competing sites could n't touch . <h> 4 . Contribute To Other Sites <p> When first starting out , becoming a contributor to other sites is an effective way to pull in new readers to your site . There are a bunch of opportunities for this in the internet marketing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> For instance , being an ongoing contributor to SearchEngineLand- is an opportunity for someone like Janet Driscoll Miller to show her expertise in optimizing for mobile SEO . Notice that at the end of the article , the author section includes a short bio as well as a link back to her company : <p> An outlet like SearchEngineLand has HUGE reach ! They sent out this tweet to their 291,000 followers about Janets article : <p> While you may not be in the SEO or internet marketing space , you can follow this same strategy for many other types of businesses . <p> Click here to read Brian Deans guide to guest posting . Its full of great suggestions on what to search for and where to look when you want to find new sites that you can contribute to . <p> While finding an industry site to be a regular contributor to is ideal , you can also find more irregular opportunities with guest posting on other sites . Typically this has the same effect as you are getting in front of a new audience and showing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marketing agency , they were looking for opportunities to find some new leads . The owner , Jason Parks , decided that taking the time and effort to contribute their expertise on a handful of industry sites would help increase both traffic and revenue . <p> Today they contribute regularly to 5 well known industry websites on topics such as social media , SEO , and digital advertising . By writing top-notch content , Jason and his team have begun to position themselves as an authority in the industry . <p> Jason delivers the goods to places like Social Media Today , and in return he gets a- killer- author bio like this : <p> The- Numbers <p> Since The Media Captain started contributing to other industry websites , theyve seen their referral traffic increase by 45% and have seen about a 10% uptick in leads . <p> sunote <p> Key Takeaway : - Quality comes first . Do n't  just start throwing up content anywhere that will take it . Instead , look to post on sites with authority , that look professional and already publish great content . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goods ! This could be your one shot , so make sure to give your absolute best effort . <p> /sunote <h> 5 . Share it like crazy <p> Once you 've started producing amazing content for your own site , and for related sites you need to share it . <p> Sure you can write some content for long tail keywords and pull in traffic from Google , but sharing with people who might be interested in what you have to say is a fast and effective way to increase your audience . <p> Max Galka understands the value of sharing content . <p> Max is the co-founder of Revaluate- an apartment review site in New York . <p> As you could imagine , ranking for real estate related keywords in the New York market can be difficult . <p> They were getting about 100 visits per day on their website , when they discovered the power of getting their content into the right hands . <p> A few months ago , Max published an article listing the 5 craziest buildings in New York . <p> If he would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the abyss of the countless other blog posts published each day . <p> However , Max did n't  use the " publish and pray " method he started sharing the article . <p> In his words , " Our previous ad hoc attempts at marketing posts did not accomplish much We did some research and made a list of places where people share blog content ( forums , Reddit , Hacker News , Stumbleupon , Quora , Yahoo Answers , the different social media platforms , Craigslist , RSS aggregators , Outbrain , etc ) . <p> For each of those platforms , we looked for places where people may appreciate the post ( e.g. social media groups about NYC , top 10 lists , architecture , real estate , etc ) . - And after publishing the post , went around and shared it . " <p> There are tons of places where you can share your content . So keep a running list of sharing sites , forums , etc. that may be interested in your content so you are n't  starting from scratch every time you publish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ produced about 400 social shares and 7,000 visits to their website in the next 24 hours . <p> Not everything you publish is going to be a smash hit . <p> In fact , some groups you share with may not like it at all . Max was surprised at how varied the responses were . For example , the NYC subreddit voted it down , but the urbanexploration subreddit loved it and provided a lot of traffic . <p> Stumbleupon did n't  send much traffic at all to this particular post , but a more recent post about famous buildings in New York sent about 3,000 visitors from Stumbleupon in just 2 days . <p> Here are some key takeaways from Max that I completely agree with : <p> Think through the different groups who may be interested in your content <p> Spend the time researching your options for sharing content. - There are a ton of options out there . <p> It is hard to predict who will like it , and it takes some- trial and error to figure it out <p> sunote <p> Consider This : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and tell nobody about it ? Revaluate is the perfect example of how your traffic numbers can explode when you produce great content and then get it in front of the right people . <p> /sunote <h> Wrap Up <p> My hope is that by presenting a few practical , real life examples of content marketing success that you 'll be inspired ! <p> Here is a quick recap : <p> 1 . Get started ! Whether you have no website , or like Jonathan Bentz you 've inherited a site that needs some work you need to start moving in the right direction. - Find some " easy wins " like optimizing current blog posts . <p> 2 . Figure out a direction for your content. - The 2 easiest ways to do this are to listen to your customers and to do keyword research . Find out what people are asking and start answering those questions on your website ( and answering them in a better way than your competitors ) <p> 3 . Make better content by writing thorough , long posts and linking out to authority sources on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If you were searching that keyword , would you think that your page is better than the other results in Google ? <p> 4 . Contribute to other industry sites . You 'll both build authority for your brand as well as find new traffic opportunities . Make sure that you only contribute to relevant , high quality sites and ALWAYS give your best effort when contributing . This is your one chance at a first impression . <p> 5 . Start sharing. - Creating the best content is one thing , but like Revaluate you have to help people find it . Start making a list of sites , forums , etc. in your industry ( besides the big sharing sites like Reddit and Stumbleupon ) so you have places to tell about your post . <p> You should also think creatively in Revaluates case they were sharing with sites dedicated to New York City , not just real estate sites . Are there other " related " sites which may be interested in some of your posts ?

@@21641505 @1641505/ <p> However , just because something works for a lot of people does n't  mean that it works for everyone . Many small business owners in particular , - have so many different things going on that the thought of having to learn WordPress does n't  sound like much fun at all . <p> Today were going to give you a list of the best WordPress alternatives for business , with the focus on platforms that are easy to setup and maintain for the average , non-techie person. - If you 've already chosen a platform , we actually have guides for Seo on Squarespace as well as for Weebly . <p> Click on a- logo- below- if you want to jump straight to a particular service : <p> A couple of notes before we dive in <p> First , I 'm not necessarily picking a " winner " here . You 'll find that many of these solutions specialize in different things . Some are simple website builders and no more , while others like Hubspot are more of a business solution that happens to include website management . <p> Second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a big difference in the website tool you choose . Some tools like Shopify and Bigcommerce are built with online stores in mind , and others have a more limited feature set when it comes to managing the sale of physical products on your own website . <p> Third , this is n't intended to be a full review of each service . I 'm merely bringing you some of the best WordPress alternatives and hitting the highlights on why I think they are worth exploring further . <p> Shall we begin ? <h> Weebly <p> In the spirit of full disclosure , I 've been a Weebly customer for several years . At this point I also have many sites built on WordPress , but still maintain sites for myself and for businesses Ive helped on Weebly . <p> My goal is to give a list of viable WordPress alternatives , not to sell you on any one service . That said , when friends whove never done a website before ask me what to use I tell them Weebly without hesitation . <p> With Weebly , you start by picking a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> This is one area where theyve come a long way since I started with them . The most common request in the early days on their blog seemed to be people asking for more theme options , and I 'd say that Weebly delivered in a big way . <p> Youve got a number of sleek , modern themes to choose from all of which are mobile-friendly automatically . This simply means that when somebody comes to your website from their phone , your site will adapt and look like it was made for that small screen . <h> Weebly Site Builder <p> The Weebly site builder that you are taken to is a " drag and drop " interface . So you click on an element that you want , like an image or text block and drag it over to where you want it on your website , and then enter the text or upload the image . <p> There are a number of different functions like inserting multiple columns , custom HTML , etc. that all follow this pattern . <p> The tagline Weebly uses to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I really think that 's a fair assessment . It is about as straightforward as it comes and you could have a small , very professional , self-made website ready to go within a couple of hours . <h> Weebly Ecommerce <p> If your business is selling products ( physical or digital ) online , Weebly also has a built in shopping cart and store management functionality . They are integrated with several different payment solutions including Square , Paypal , Stripe , and Authorize.net so adding products and getting people to pay you is also a pretty simple process . <p> I do n't  want to get too bogged down in the features , after all you can always start out with a free account and play around to see if you like it before upgrading to a more full-feature account . Perhaps its best to show a couple of sites that use Weeblys ecommerce features : <h> Weebly Pricing <p> As mentioned earlier , you can start with a free account and see what you think about the website builder and the ecommerce features ( if you plan to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the appropriate account for your business and keep building your site . <p> Here is a quick breakdown of Weebly pricing : <p> The main difference between Pro and Business is the more robust ecommerce features . If you are a true ecommerce store , you 'll want the Business plan because it has an unlimited number of products , coupon codes , and more . <p> However , if your business is a service company , let 's say an HVAC company then Pro would be all that you need . <p> In both cases , the price you see includes hosting . This is true of many WordPress alternatives , which really simplifies things for you because outside of your domain name purchase , everything you need is in one spot . <h> Wix <p> They have hundreds of templates to choose from , and most of them are very sharp and modern looking . Once you view a template and start building , theyll ask you to create an account , but it is free to build . <p> Eventually , you 'll want to upgrade to a paid account @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other features that come with it ( more on that later ) . <p> Besides the built-in elements of a typical website , Wix also has an App Market where you can get even more add-ons for you site like customer review modules , event calendars , and a lot more . Some are free and some are things you pay for , but often have a free trial . <h> Wix Site Builder <p> As mentioned prior , the Wix site builder is right there with Weebly as the simplest to work with in my opinion . Once you start your site , the main screen will look like this : <p> One feature in particular that I love about Wix is shown above , the ability to change the entire color palette with just one click . <p> All the tools on this list will let you change the color of just about anything that you want , but often you are changing one thing at a time . Since color coordination is n't my strong suit , I like being able to pick from some sets of color @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at once . <p> Another thing that separates Wixs site builder from many others is that you can really put anything just about anywhere . Once you 've added an element like a Youtube video or a block of text , you can then click and drag it to exactly where you want it . <p> Here is an example from my test site , where I dragged the text " Just Because I Can " over an existing block of text : <p> Obviously youd never do something quite like that , but there may be times when it makes sense to overlap or layer things on your site . In most drag and drop editors , this is n't possible . I 'd have to drop that headline below my paragraph or above it , no matter what . <p> So the Wix editor gives you a lot of freedom . <p> But what about Wix and SEO ? <p> Perhaps you 've heard that Wix sites are terrible for Google . Brian Quinn of MYOB Web Design said- - " Wix has gotten some bad press about SEO . However , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ templates . Since they made the transition to- HTML5 in 2012 , this no longer seems to be the case . I 've found that my- clients sites perform very well on Google and other search engines . " <h> Wix Ecommerce <p> Wix has a well built-out ecommerce solution that is available in their upper tier subscription packages . You can add all of your products into their Wixstore and then add- product galleries and collections of products on your site . <p> From the payment side , they let you choose from a list of 7 different payment vendors including Paypal so people can purchase your products online . <h> Wix Pricing <p> As mentioned , Wix let 's you start building for free . However , once it comes time to " go live " you are going to want to upgrade to one of the packages below so you can have your own domain name and a host of other features : <p> Notice that these prices are if you pay for the year in advance , as opposed to going month to month . You can cancel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days of purchase . However , since you can build things out for free you should really have a good idea whether or not Wix is for you before you actually purchase anything . <p> They do include an optional free domain registration with most of their packages , which helps sweeten the deal a bit . However , you can also bring a domain purchased elsewhere over to Wix . <h> Squarespace <p> Squarespace has made a splash in recent years as another great alternative to WordPress and more traditional content management systems . There are many similarities to the feature set I mentioned with Weebly above , so I 'll hit the highlights . <p> I heard from many small business owners in the research phase of this post and did n't  hear one bad thing about Squarespace . <p> In fact , Kevin Tumlinson started using Squarespace back in 2010 . He said " I just liked the simplicity of it . But the thing that really- sold me was the customer support . Any time I have an issue , the Squarespace- team bends over backwards to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all on me- to figure things out . Instead , they try to figure out the best way for me- to get things back in order and keep me moving . " <p> Kevin went on to rave about the built-in integrations like Google apps that have come available in the last few years . He said " WordPress- was never this easy . " <h> Squarespace Site Builder <p> When you first sign-up , you start by choosing a template or theme that defines the look of your website. - They are sorted by category , and at the time of this writing there are 13 different themes in the " business " category . Each one has a very modern look and is mobile friendly out of the box . <p> You can start very quickly with a free trial , and then begin by answering a few different questions like the purpose of your site and information about your business ( shown to the left ) . <p> After that , you are taken to their main site builder which has all your options to the left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ start creating and editing based on your starter template . <p> If you 're building a site and plan to follow the placement of text and images of the template , you 'll find that updates are very simple to do . <p> If you want to add in more images and different features , there are some drag and drop elements but in my opinion it takes a little bit of getting used to in order to get things just the way you want them . <p> The flip side of that is that you have customization options on just about everything if you really want to dig in . <h> Squarespace- Pricing <p> Squarespace has 3 different tiers of pricing , but let 's you start with a 14 day free trial . The most expensive plan is $24 per month , which is geared for those in ecommerce selling a bunch of products online . <p> Each package includes a " free " domain name for a year , which is a nice feature . After that , it renews at $20 per year which is n't unreasonable . For comparison @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place like 1and1 or GoDaddy . <p> If you are n't  an ecommerce business that is selling products online with needs for a shopping cart , etc. then the $16 per month option is probably the best for you . <p> Here is a look at all 3 pricing options ( note that this pricing is billed annually , month to month is a little more expensive ) : <p> Here are a couple of businesses using Squarespace with their integrated ecommerce : <h> Shopify <p> While Squarespace and Weebly were more universal business solutions meaning whether or not you actually sell goods online , Shopify is built with online ecommerce retailers in mind . <p> Maybe its better said that Weebly and Squarespace are- website builders that also have- ecommerce and Shopify is- an ecommerce solution that also has a website builder . <p> Because of that , they offer more features like a POS system to manage you in-person sales , along with TONS of options for accepting payments in your- online sales platform . <h> Shopify Website Builder <p> Shopify has over 100 templates to choose from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them are free and some are " premium " ( AKA they cost money . ) <p> You do have full control over your sites design , so colors , logos , etc. can all be switched out easily . Shopify can also connect you with professional designers if you are looking for something beyond what you can do with templates . Obviously you can also find and hire your own designer for a Shopify site if you 'd like to do that . <p> When you get into the site and start editing pages , the designer looks more " WordPress-like " or perhaps something like Microsoft Word if that is a more familiar reference . Here is the page editor ( highlighting the add image button ) : <p> The process of adding products with your images and other details is very simple to do , and includes some cool features like " collections " which you can setup to creatively package your products . " For example , you can create a smart collection that automatically gathers all products under $20 and present this smart collection as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shopify also has their own version of an " App Store " which really let 's you customize your site and the features quite a bit . If you 're familiar with WordPress , it is a similar concept to " plug-ins . " The Shopify apps include different options for coupons , integrating social media , setting up your SEO , and a lot more . <h> Shopify Pricing <p> Shopify offers a 14 day free trial on all their plans . They also include an unlimited number of products and a free POS card reader if you want to use Shopify to take payments in your retail location . <p> Many places could get by on the basic plan , but stepping up to professional gives you access to gift cards and better reporting . The credit card rate also comes down the higher your package level , so if you are doing high volume then stepping up to a more expensive solution may pay for itself . <h> Hubspot <p> Hubspot may not jump to mind when thinking about a WordPress alternative , but its definitely a solution worth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ level . <p> Hubspot is much more than a " CMS " or website builder . Its really focused on sales and marketing intelligence and automation , and building your website is just one part of that .

It is a website solution , but their big focus is on building stores online . If you are n't  selling products on your website ( and do n't  plan to ) they Bigcommerce is n't your best option I 'd go with something like Weebly or- Wix . <p> It comes with a built-in shopping cart and payment gateway , plus plenty of other tools for marketing , SEO , and reporting . They also integrate with over 65 payment services like Paypal and others . <p> Once you start your store , the admin dashboard has a nice clean look with high level reporting in the forefront : <p> Going to the " Design " area allows you to choose from a marketplace of themes ( free and paid ) : <p> Bigcommerce has a quick start wizard that walks you through adding your products and setting up your payment information .

Weve given some information on some of your premiere options already , some of which come at a premium price tag . <p> Here is a quick breakdown- of 4 more alternatives that you can start for free and make a pretty nice site for your business without spending a fortune : <h> Jimdo <p> Jimdo fits into what I 'll call the " Weebly-style " website builder , where you pick a template and then use some drag and drop functionality to customize and add to your content . They have about 15 ready @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the option to start with a blank template . In Jimdo , you would click to " add element " and then choose from a menu of items to add : <p> Jimdo has a free package available , so you can dive right in and start building . They also offer a $240 per year business package , which includes 2 domain names and let 's you add as many products as you 'd like with a Paypal integrated shopping cart . <p> If you are n't  selling online , the $90 per year package would probably be sufficient for you as it also includes one domain name . <h> Virb <p> Virb is another online website builder that is focused on simplicity . They have only one tier in pricing , which is $10 per month . This does n't  include a domain name , but you have the ability to buy a domain elsewhere and connect it to your Virb account . <p> This also includes connection with an Etsy or Big Cartel store for your product pages . <p> Once you sign up for Virb ( 10 day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ start building . The main site builder looks like this when you are ready to add new pages : <p> Once you go to create a page , it will look like a fairly typical WYSIWYG editor as we saw with Shopify and BigCommerce : <p> Virb is n't necessarily as feature-rich as some of the other WordPress alternatives we 've discussed , but its very affordable and has a lot of nice looking , mobile-friendly themes to start with . <h> Webs.com <p> Webs.com ( not to be confused with Web.com , which youve probably seen on TV ) is a drag and drop website builder that can be used for personal sites or for business . <p> The business package runs for about $23 per month , and it includes the ability to do ecommerce using Paypal or Stripe to accept payments . <p> Webs.com also advertises that theyll give you a " free " domain name at this price , so you wont have to worry about registering separately . <p> As is typical in this type of website builder , you can start building for free and upgrade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but in my humble opinion they do n't  look quite as modern as Squarespace , - Weebly , or Wix . <p> Once you 've created an account , the Webs.com site builder looks like this : <p> It is pretty simple to use , as you just drag whatever kind of content you want up into the page area above . You can get rolling pretty quickly without any special design skills . <h> - Wrap Up <p> As you can see , picking the right website solution really depends on your needs and preferences . I think all 10 of these WordPress alternatives have their place , but some are better than others depending on your budget , your business model , and how picky you are about the design of your site . <p> Once you 've made a selection , the next step is to learn how to rank in Google and get more free traffic to your site .

@@21641507 @1641507/ <h> Wix vs . Weebly A Fair Comparison <p> Today we are going to delve into Wix vs . Weebly and what Ive dubbed " a fair comparison . " <p> We all want unbiased information , but virtually everyone has a bias of some sort . ( Full disclosure Ive been a paying Weebly customer and used free Wix sites for several years ) . Today I 'm going to give you the low down of 2 of the leading user friendly site builders so you can make an educated decision on which is right for you . <p> The good news is , both Weebly and Wix are big time players in this space and have a ton to offer . So you really cant make a " bad decision . " Both are excellent they are just different . At the core , they are both designed to make building and maintaining- a professional looking website very simple to non-technical users . <p> If you 've already chosen a platform to build your site on , good for you . If it happens to be Weebly , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> So let 's talk about some of those differences and why they matter : <h> Wix vs . Weebly Getting Started <p> One thing I love about both of these tools is that they let you start for free , and continue for free INDEFINITELY . So unlike Squarespace and most of the others in this space , you do n't  have just 14 days or some other fixed amount of time to try it out . <p> While Wix and Weebly both have free accounts , you 'll definitely need to upgrade to a paid plan when it comes time to go live . Well go through the details in our pricing comparison a little later , but I wanted to make the point that you can start either of these tools with no obligation and see how you like it before making a decision . <h> Creating a Wix Website <p> When you first start with Wix and create a site , the first thing you 'll do is pick a free template . This is the overall look and design of your site . <p> Wix has " 100s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ responsive , meaning theyll automatically look nice on a smartphone or smaller screen . Based on sheer quantity , Wix has much more variety to offer in the way of templates than Weebly . <p> Once you 've selected a template ( which you can change at any time ) , you simply click the " edit site " button and you are immediately taken to the Wix editor to begin customizing this template with your own text , logo , images , etc . <p> You can even make sweeping changes to the content and layout if you 'd like , but for the average user its easier to stick pretty close to their existing design and just update the content . Once you get into moving tons of stuff around , you can get pretty far down that rabbit hole and end up getting nothing accomplished ! <p> So the incredible freedom that Wix gives you with their site editor can be both a blessing and curse , as they say . <p> Here is a 90 second overview of how the Wix editor works : <h> Creating a Weebly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wix . When you add a site , you 'll put in some details like the site name and choose what the URL will be . To start , you can just use a " WHATEVER.weebly.com " style URL until you are ready to go . You can always buy a domain later and connect it to your site . <p> After that , you 'll be choosing your template/theme in Weebly that will be the look of your site . Like Wix , Weebly themes are mobile-friendly out of the box which is super convenient . You do n't  have to do anything extra to make your site look great on mobile devices . Here are a couple of Weebly themes : <p> A few Weebly Themes <p> As mentioned earlier , Weebly does n't  have the same amount of selection as far as themes go . However , theyve added a couple dozen very sleek and modern themes in the last couple of years so you should have no problem finding one you like . <p> Here is a brief overview of what editing a site is like in Weebly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make changes and customizations to the look of your site , there are really some sharp looking examples out there . You can also hire a designer or professional to get a more custom look if needed , but that may defeat some of the- purpose of using Wix- or Weebly in the first place since one of the main benefits is getting a professional looking site done quickly and for an affordable price . <p> Both make getting started very quick and easy . Wix has more templates to choose from , but both have a number of modern theme options that are almost certain to- please . With the right customization , sites on both Weebly and Wix can look amazing . <h> Comparing the Wix and Weebly Editors <p> In the videos above , you saw a quick overview of what each editor looks like and the features it contains . Both Wix and Weebly have " drag and drop " editors , meaning that you click on elements like blocks of text , images , etc. and drop them where you want them on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intuitive website editing tools out there . It should take you just a minute or two after logging in to " get it " and start building out your site . <p> Here are some of the key features and differences : <h> Wix Editor Overview <p> When you choose a pre-made template with Wix , you are really starting with a site that is pretty much built out. - Its kind of like you are taking over an existing website to edit rather than starting from scratch . <p> You can decide if that is a good thing , but I kind of like it . <p> If you are short on imagination , it will give you some ideas about where to place your content rather than having a complete blank slate . <p> One of my favorite things about Wixs editor is in the " Design " options . The design icon looks like a paint brush on the left , and let 's you change the background , colors , and font . <p> In the colors section , they have a catalog of color palettes to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , including Weebly , you are editing one color at a time after you choose your template . <p> You can customize the palettes in Wix if you want , but having a set of complimentary colors to go with is really convenient . I know for myself , I do n't  really trust my color coordination skills and would prefer just to choose a full set of colors as opposed to picking one color for every little bit of text , background , etc. on my site . <p> Adding and editing pages is actually pretty similar in Wix and Weebly . When you go to the pages section , you 'll see a list of all existing pages and can move them around and quickly choose whether to have them in your navigation , customize SEO settings ( more on this later ) , etc . <p> Once you 've created a page , you can then start adding elements to the page and drag them wherever you want , literally . Wix even let 's you have 2 elements overlap if you want. - Check out how I put some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> While you would never do this kind of thing having total freedom can be helpful in some circumstances . You can overlay text and images , change spacing , and more without much trouble . <p> Wix let 's you drop in all kinds of text , media , galleries , contact forms , and a boatload of available apps ( free and paid ) that you can add to your site . There is no shortage of options . <h> How does that compare to Weebly ? <p> The Weebly editor is setup similarly , with all of your elements on the left that give you the ability to add just about anything you can think of to your website . <p> Your design , pages , and settings can all be accessed at the top and give you full control over your site . <p> With the Weebly editor , you can add multiple columns inside of a page and as you are dragging elements to the page you can choose to put them above , below , or beside any other element on the page . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to show you where you are about to put your text , image , etc. ; eliminating guesswork : <p> So putting a text block on top of another one is n't possible , but the instances when one would actually use that capability are quite rare . <p> Overall , I 'd put Weeblys editor up against any of the others- based on the ease of use and the amount of customization you can do . <p> I kind of like the fact that it puts stuff in an appropriate place for you automatically . To further illustrate the point , here 's what I get when I add an image via Wix : <p> It puts the full size image in the middle of my page . From there , I can then- shrink it and drag it around wherever I want . I 'm not a big fan of that workflow . <p> I prefer how Weebly does it where I pick a logical spot first , and then choose my image . <p> Wix editor gives you the most freedom Ive seen from a drag and drop site builder . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be a good thing . Weebly uses drag and drop as well and is n't quite as " wide open , " but I actually prefer that for myself . <h> Wix vs . Weebly SEO <p> SEO ( search engine optimization ) is the process of setting your site up for success in the search engines like Google . <p> Years ago , Wix was flash-based and had a pretty bad reputation for SEO . While it still is n't a resounding favorite of the SEO community , - they have a number of success stories and millions of customers for a reason . If it were impossible to rank a Wix website in Google , do you think theyd have those kind of results ? <p> Weebly gives you a fair amount of control as well , and as mentioned earlier I 've been a paying Weebly Pro customer for several years . In that time , I 've had a site that 's averaged over 100,000 visitors per year with almost all of the traffic coming organically from the search engines . <p> I like to make SEO very practical and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a topic that can easily be overwhelming , but here 's the approach that has worked for me : <p> I start the SEO discussion by- focusing on the importance of keywords . If you are n't  familiar , keywords are basically just things people search for in Google . When you start a new site , the strategy I suggest is to find the right keywords to target in your niche or industry . <p> What are the right keywords ? - <p> The ideal keywords have a fair amount of people searching for them , and they have relatively low competition in the top 10 results of Google . These are what we call " low competition , long tail keywords . " The idea is that by creating a page or blog post on your site that targets this keyword and delivers great information , you 'll have a higher chance to rank on page 1 of the search engines than if you focus on keywords that are overly competitive . <p> Most people who start out with Weebly or Wix do n't  think that way , so you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Once you 've nailed down your keyword strategy , you can then start implementing it in Wix or Weebly . <p> In Weebly , you are able to set your general site description and add header and footer code under the " settings " area : <p> Perhaps more importantly , you can go into " advanced settings " on each individual page and blog post and set your SEO title and meta description . This allows you to use your focus keyword(s) of that page in the title and description , which are both important from an SEO standpoint . <p> Here is a look at the advanced settings in Weebly for an individual page : <p> In Weebly , the page name gets used in URL . In a Weebly blog post , you can actually set the end of the URL to be whatever you 'd like which is very helpful . In both cases , you end up with a rather simple , succinct URL to your pages and posts . <p> The URL structure in Wix is n't quite so simple . <p> Having a URL that is n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but URLS are important for shareability , SEO , and click through rates . <p> Here is how Wix explains their URL structure and confirms that you cant change it . <p> To give you an example , here is what the default URL of my " Studios " page looked like on Wix : <p> mysite.com/SITENAME# ! studios/cjg9 <p> If I had built a page called studios on Weebly , the URL would be something like this : <p> mysite.com/studios <p> See the difference ? <p> Wix does confirm that you can use 301 redirects to get better looking URLS in place , but it does take some extra effort . <p> Beyond the URL structure , Wix does give you the ability to update the page title and meta description of every page and blog post which is critical when focusing on certain keywords with that page . <p> This can all be found under SEO Page Settings and should not be overlooked ! <p> Conclusion : <p> Based on the keyword strategy I follow , I prefer the SEO settings in Weebly because you do have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vs . Weebly Pricing <p> The pricing of Wix and Weebly is similar enough that if you feel strongly about one over the other pricing should n't be a deciding factor . Here is a quick look at Wix pricing options : <p> The big variable is whether or not you sell products on your website . If not , the $12.42 plan should work well and comes with some free goodies like a domain for one year and some ad vouchers . <p> Here is the current pricing for Weebly : <p> Weebly Pricing <p> If you are an e-commerce business , you 'll want the " Business " package with Weebly as it includes all the e-commerce features you 'll need . For businesses that do n't  sell products online , a " Pro " plan will do just fine . <h> Wrap Up <p> As stated at the outset , these are 2 of the leading DIY website builders for a reason . <p> Each one is outstanding . <p> Since both let you start for free , there is no reason to get too worried about the decision . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and see which one you like working with . <p> Thank you for the in-depth comparison . I think Wix is the better choice because they offer more tools and features on their higher priced options and all their paid plans are generally cheaper than Weeblys . <p> A note about Wix for you to update in your review above and this is an important one with Wix you CAN NOT change your template at any time or ever . Once you choose a template , that 's it ! You are committed to it forever , unless you want to rebuild your entire website from scratch . <p> great article , thank you ! It helps a lot . Just one question : All the links that should go direct to weebly " Clik here to Try weebly " for example ( I asume this are affiliate links ) take me to the SEO guide page ( http : **29;453;TOOLONG ) instead of leading me to the weebly site . Do you do this on purpose ? If you get some percentage when somebody want to start weebly or wix @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just created my website with wix a few weeks ago and I am now switching to weebly and having to recreate the whole site again . Their SEO is very difficult . After creating all the keywords , changing the page names , etc. my site is still not being indexed . I created a blogger page and that was indexed in 24 hours . Since my business is local , I really need it to come up on search engines . Wish I would have read your post before spending so much time and money on wix . Live and learn , I guess .. They make great websites , but what is the point if no one can find them 
@@21641509 @1641509/ <h> The Rise of Semantic Search ( and Semantic SEO ) <p> The way that people are using the Internet is in a state of constant flux " its mutable and ever-changing , which is a good thing . It pushes search engines to get better at their game all the time . <p> Today , search is driven by user intent . We 're no longer satisfied with typing up a keyword in the search engine and sifting through tens or even more results before we get to the information we 're looking for . <p> When was the last time you typed in restaurant Palo Alto ' -or wherever and hit the search button ? Probably years ago , right ? <h> Latent Semantic Indexing " What the Heck- is That ? <p> That 's what changed . Search engines started to use latent semantic indexing to order information into understandable and connected chunks " text , ideas , and topics , everything you can find on the web is now interconnected and helps search engines serve up better results . <p> So what exactly does semantic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an old , old linguistics term . It is a branch of linguistics that studies the relationship between words and sentences and their actual meaning . <p> When applied to Internet search , semantics takes on a slightly different yet basically same meaning . <p> Semantic search is a technique that takes into account searchers intent and the contextual meaning of words or phrases in an effort to improve accuracy and display the most relevant results . <p> In the world of the LSI , the semantic web- and semantic searches , it 's only natural that SEO practices are going to shift as well . That shift is already happening , and I encourage you to think of long tail keywords as LSI keywords . This is because search engines look at the keywords entered , complete with supporting and related terms , in order to gauge user intent . <p> Right now , semantic SEO is just a buzzword . However , at some point in the future , the term semantic SEO will disappear because- the only people left in the industry will be those- who understand- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practice , what this means is that Google knows that when you search for highway , in many cases , that means the same thing as freeway . When you search for pop , in some contexts that can mean soda , sometimes it has something to do with music , and sometimes its to do with balloons . <h> Search Then Versus Search Now <p> Back in the day , the algorithm would spew out pages based on keywords entered and the overall ranking of the page . Links equaled better positioning . Back-linking and shoddy gray hat methods were the webmasters best friends " back-linking is still up there , although the quality version of it . <p> This is because crawlers depend on something called co-citation to verify the importance of a page . Co-citation is one of the building blocks of semantic search and it happens like this . <p> When two different pages mention a page and they share a similar topic ( remember , linking and shared keywords are not really required ) they send a signal to the crawlers that the mentioned page @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and boost each other 's ranking. - Chances are that they will appear on the same page during a search because they evolve something similar to a symbiotic relationship . Naturally , one page is heavier ' than the other " usually the one that gets the mentions " and it will probably be located on an authority site . <p> Another important signal for the algorithm is something called co-occurrence . Co-occurrence is a term that describes topically similar keywords that are not the same but naturally appear in the text containing the keyword as supporting words and terms . <p> For example , go to Google and type in omega 3 ' . Open the first result ( it 's an article on Mercola.com ) and do some keyword digging . You will notice that omega-3 shows up nearly 50 times on the page but it 's not lonely . Words health ' , fish oil ' , krill oil ' , and more show up almost the same amount of time . <p> Thanks to the fact that the crawlers use co-occurrence and co-citation as signals , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Omega meaning " you will not see a single mention of Omega nebula , Omega watches , or the- Omega constant ( a math thing ) . <p> As I 've already mentioned , this new semantic search engine is changing how we do SEO " slowly right now but those who adapt to it immediately will reap some substantial benefits in the future . <h> SEO in the Age of LSI <p> Although SEO professionals shouldnt- panic when it comes to latent semantic indexing and semantic web search they definitely need to prepare for the inevitable " a shift in how SEO works and on what it focuses on . <p> That focus will be on user intent and context , not on keywords . You will have to understand how search engines think ' " for the lack of a better term " and adapt your strategy accordingly . <p> Of course , keywords will still be important , especially long-tail keywords as they will serve as a ubiquitous signal to the search engines " they will let them know what your page is about . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether you succeed or fail in the future . <p> Mentioning specific keywords will matter less and less <p> This is something that you might have already noticed . Type anything into the search engine and look at how many results show up not containing one or more terms you 've used in your search . <p> That 's because search engines care less about providing an exact match then they do about getting the results they perceive will be most valuable to you . <p> Instead of trying to shoehorn- your exact keyword ( e.g- best brand of pop ) into an article 4 or 5 times , focus on finding related terms that you can- incorporate into your content so you can harness the power of co-occurrence . Increasingly , top soda brands means the same thing to the search engine as best brand of pop . This will be the most important signal search engines will use in the future " along with user intent and co-citation . <p> Stop focusing on anchor text <p> LSI is not focusing on anchor text as the most important signal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Instead , focus on how to spread your influence and benefit from co-citation. - When selecting anchor text , link naturally there 's no need to force your exact keyword matches into anchor text . <p> Harness the power of Google Knowledge Graph <p> Google knowledge graph is all about answering users ' questions on the search page and presenting inter-related terms and concepts in a way that goes beyond typical search . <p> It 's all about presence and while popular brands and famous persons benefit most from it , ignore it at your own peril . <p> Maintain a strong Google + presence " it 's a pain but might help you in the long-run <p> Create your own Wikipedia page <p> Create a strong content marketing strategy and get people searching for your brand " it signals to Google that you 're important enough to arouse interest <p> Create valuable content that people will share <p> This feature might , in the future , be of immense help to marketers looking to build presence and grab people 's attention while they 're still doing top-of-funnel searches . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's all about getting mentions , likes , and shares , and getting picked up by authority sites as a good source of information . Whenever this happens , your ratings in the SERPs will get a slight boost " this is because those mentions signal to the search engines that you 're valuable enough to be picked up by others . <p> Even who you mention might affect your exposure . Do n't be shy about mentioning your competition " even if you have to do it with a positive spin . SEO is increasingly becoming a PR game and building your brand is more than simply dissing your competitors . Find other ways of differentiating and use co-citation to drive the value of your page up . <p> It 's all about semantics <p> Structure and create content so it references the terms that are related to your keyword . Use supporting jargon and language and make sure that you know what you 're talking about . Search engines will award you if they can figure out that you 're an expert on the topic " so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your site so everything supports each other .

Google is getting smarter and smarter and the semantic web is just around the corner . It saves SEOs from having to intentionally misspell keywords or mention the exact keyword x % of the time in a text . <p> Hi Spencer : Looking ahead my wisdom tells me that LTPP would be further improved to fit LSI SEO . Does this mean that current LTPP LT Members may or will have to pay for future up coming updates after we were told that LT members would receive updates at no additional costs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of purchased whenever no additional costs or free is used . Additionally , 1 ) Because you no longer are the sole owner or majority owner that have the veto power . 2 ) I do n't  have much trust in the new owners to honor your business philosophy and principles Long time user <p> I agree with the viewpoints of the author and yes , search engines are smarter than us . We need to craft the content in a better way to please the search engines . Using LSI keywords for the main keyword would help us to hold the good SERP . Keyword stuffing and keyword repeating types of SEO have dead . <p> I have been using LTP Platinum since 2014 , and it works well for me . Good to know that G+ presence has value and I have already been there .

Before I knew about them I simply used to target a couple of long tail keywords and submit them in Yoast . But once I realised that LSI Keywords was the major part I was missing out on my blogging style was never the same again . <p> Fantastic post , I definitely agree that adjusting to and embracing semantic SEO is a new part of our roles as search-focused marketers . Im excited to see what kinds of results/data people bring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used as a ranking factor . I sort of like to think of it this way , every piece of text on a result that is n't plain black gets treated as a ranking factor to some extent ( title , URL ) ; why not the structured snippet , too ? I 'm simplifying , but I think there 's some validity there . <p> To add my thoughts on your last question , I 'm saying " yes " ! I think it makes a whole lot of sense for small and large web publishers to use semantic markup . I mean , if nothing else you 're getting some seriously hot search results . If things end up where I think a number of us suspect they 're heading , web publishers could also get a significant benefit when engines enhance how they utilize , analyze , and reward structured data on those sites . <p> LSI keyword is definitely important for SEO .

So , your pages could be exactly the same , but have very different authority primarily based on what sites are linking to them . <p> Hi Spencer . I have several keywords where the page-authority and the domain-authority are really different . For example , very weak PD in a highly authoritive ( general ) domain . Your last answer suggest that this means weak competition if I would like to rank for the same keyword , they are only weak competition . Is that right ? <p> Is there a scale correlation between Page Authority and Competitiveness ? You had one on the beta page about the correlation between KC and relative competitiveness . Is there something similar somewhere for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my site PA ( 39 ) , however , the domain ( 29 ) its only 9 months old even thought its not a year yet I think I 'm doing pretty well .

Of course , this last part was totally optional ; especially if it interfered with the number of times you could repeat keyword ( ah , the bad- old days of keyword stuffing ) <p> Over time , - Google smartened up and decided that enough is enough . Google has made incremental changes to their search algorithm over the years . The days where you 'd want to repeat your keyword 50 times in one page are gone .

It serves more as a keyword @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and press enter and you will be immediately presented with a long list of related terms .

In the free version you will get up to 100 results and the only metric that is readily available is relative frequency " which is shown as a bar chart so it 's not particularly useful at all .

SEO Book spits out a rather clean page with all the relevant metrics included in it " you even have access to daily searches which is neglected by a lot of other services but can be useful to some . <p> Keyword Spy is a comprehensive tool that is more geared toward PPC but can be used by content marketers to get a feel for what the users are searching online . What I like about it is that it has separate tabs for PPC competitors and organic competitors . It will also show you search volumes for related terms and a pretty accurate CPC as well as pull out the overview of ads competing for your particular keyword . <p> PROS : <p> Great overview and usability <p> Various tabs relating to organic/paid competitors , misspelled/similar terms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for PPC <p> CONS : <p> Only one available search before registration <p> Free version offers a limited number of keyword suggestions <p> Unable to download keyword lists in free version <h> So , which Keyword Tool is your favorite ? <p> The whole list of keyword tools up here is definitely usable and I suggest making one of these tools your regular stop before writing up an article or a post . If you do n't know what people are searching for you will definitely not be able to produce anything of value and will be simply adding to the clutter that Internet has become recently . <p> In my experience , if you 're anything more than a light user you will want to focus on Google 's Keyword Planner and Google Trends . Because of their usability and functionality , they will prove to be a lot more valuable than other tools " ( Long Tail Pro is better of course ) .

@@21641520 @1641520/ <h> Need Profitable Website Ideas ? Heres A Plan For Getting Started : <p> If you 're reading this on the Long Tail Pro blog , youve most certainly wrestled with brainstorming profitable website ideas at some point . <p> Hopefully youve already found one ( or more ) , but I 'm certain that some of you- are still struggling trying to figure out a successful formula . <p> here 's the formula I 'm talking about : <p> Niche Selection + Monetization =- Revenue <p> Then , let 's go- back to ECON 101- and remember that- your revenue minus expenses will give you a profit . The good news is , fixed expenses for running a niche website are generally pretty low . <p> Let 's take a look at both parts of this equation : <h> Niche Selection <p> The very first question you have to answer is " what the heck is my site going to be about ? " <p> Remember that this goes hand in hand with revenue ; as some niches are naturally more profitable than others . <p> For instance , if your primary source of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do you think you 'd make more per sale by getting people to sign up for credit cards ? Or by referring them to buy socks- on Amazon and monetizing via Amazon Affiliates ? <p> Obviously the credit cards , all else- being equal . Discover Card pays $40 for referring a new credit card account , while you 'd probably make less than a dollar per sale on the socks . <p> So does that mean you should just go out there and start reviewing the best credit card promotions ? <p> No . <p> The second ( and often overlooked ) part of choosing a niche is analyzing the competition . Clearly a niche like credit cards is completely saturated with giants like Creditcards.com and others . - The degree of difficulty for building a profitable website in this niche is off the charts . <h> The Decision <p> The way I see it , there are 2 different ways you can go with your niche selection decision . <p> Image : ESPN.com <p> First , you can choose a topic that you know very well and are passionate about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to create most ( or all ) of the content yourself . You wont have to do as much research , you already know the kinds of things your audience is concerned about , and creating the content probably wo n't feel like work . <p> The second approach is to decide solely based on numbers . What niche do you feel that you can compete in and find enough avenues to make money ? The good thing about this approach is that you are basing your decision on data ( keyword research ) . You- also have a wider array of choices at the outset , because you really can focus your site on virtually anything that makes money- since it is n't a topic of passion anyway . <p> The downside is that you 'll have to do more research to really learn the niche and find out what people want to know . Also , you 'll need to either hire a writer or become knowledgeable enough on the topic so you can create a bunch of content and inform your readers . <h> Either Way Works <p> The good news @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all niches are created equal , but you could find a ton of examples of people who started a site because it was a passion , and ended up turning it into a revenue generating machine as something of an afterthought . <p> In my recent post about making more as an Amazon affiliate , I shared the story of 100 Days of Real Food who basically did just that . The cool thing about programs like Amazon Associates is that you can find products to sell in just about any niche you can think of . So whatever your passion , there is probably a way to make money from it if you are creative enough . <p> On the other hand , examples are everywhere for people who have started sites based on data alone . The topics werent necessarily things they knew much about , but the keyword research data said that there were a good number of people searching for things in that niche , they competition was relatively low , and there were products- and/or advertising to sell and profit from . <h> Revenue <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part . If you are raking in the traffic , its pretty easy to find ways to make money from that traffic ( although some are better than others ) . Here is a quick rundown of two of the most common ways to make money from a niche website : <h> Google Adsense <p> Google Adsense may be the quickest and simplest way to make money from your website . In short , you sign up as a Google ad publisher and then create ad units . You then take those ad units and place them on your website . Google then takes care of putting relevant ads in those slots , so when people click on them you get paid by Google for each click . <p> The amount you make varies , and like we talked about earlier , your niche/topic will affect your cost per click . Credit card companies pay more for a click than sock manufacturers . <p> Lisa Irby has a fantastic post that covers the topic of earning money with Adsense in great detail . <p> The quickest way to get started @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allows you to set where your ads will go on your entire site , all in one place . For instance , youd say to put ad 1 after the first paragraph , ad 2 in the middle of your post , and ad 3 at the end of your post . The plugin then takes care of that for you , so all you have to do is publish your post . <p> The great part about Google Adsense is that you can use it to make money in almost any niche . If you are getting traffic , a certain amount of those people are going to click on ads because Google is great- at dropping in ads that are relevant to the user . <h> Affiliate Promotions <p> The second common way to make money with your website is through affiliate promotions . This simply means that you refer a sale or a lead to another product/service/company and they will pay you fixed amount or a variable commission of some kind . <p> Promoting the right affiliate deals can be super profitable . In fact , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offer if its the right one . Check out the guide to Affiliate Marketing from Pat Flynn , who used his first site GreenExamAcademy to promote a third-party practice exam as an affiliate . <h> General Profitable Website Ideas <p> Although affiliate income and Google Adsense are only a couple of ways to make money from your website , they are two of the best candidates if you are looking for a site that earns passive income. - You can really " set it and forget it " if you 'd like , and do n't  have to worry about dealing directly in advertising sales , creating and maintaining a product , or providing customer service since you are n't  selling anything directly . <p> Before- I- share a couple of specific niche ideas , let 's go through some more general ideas that you can apply to a variety of topics and create a profitable website. <h> 1 . Providing Product Reviews <p> One of the most obvious strategies to profit from affiliate offers is to do product reviews . To stand out , you need to do real reviews for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You will only get so far by trying to do reviews of products you do n't  really know much about . <p> There are tons of keywords out there like " PRODUCT NAME review " , " What 's the best PRODUCT TYPE " , " Is PRODUCT NAME worth it ? " , etc. that you can target with solid , thorough reviews . <p> I 've held up TheWireCutter as an example before , but the point remains they provide crazy in-depth product reviews and then refer you to Amazon or other places and make affiliate income when you buy . The key to their success is that the user really gets all the information they need to make an informed purchase . <h> 2 . Product Comparisons <p> Similar to product reviews , product comparisons are another way to profit as an affiliate . Think of these as " vs. " posts , where people are comparing one product to another , one brand to another , etc . <p> Again , authenticity is important to do a helpful comparison post . Being able to give the pros and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ website visitor will allow you to send highly targeted traffic to your affiliate offers . <p> As an affiliate , you wo n't make money unless the traffic you send converts ( buys the product ) so its your job to " warm them up " before sending them over to the final destination . Writing thorough comparisons with the buyers best interest at heart is a great way to have people buy into what you are saying . <p> The great thing about people looking at your comparison posts is that they are usually- close to purchasing one or the other so they often convert well . <h> 3 . Curation Posts <p> Curation posts are simply a list of things that you pull together from around the web and put them all into one post . People love to share these kinds of lists , and you 've no doubt seen them on social media <p> 8 things only kids from the 80s will get <p> 14 ways to be your parents favorite kid <p> 56 best ice bucket challenge fails <p> While curation posts are great for sharing and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a fantastic way to incorporate affiliate offers . <p> Buzzfeed is the king of curation , and while they do n't  always have lists with affiliate links sometimes they do . The cool thing is , it gets positioned- in a way where- you do n't  feel like they are asking you to buy something . <p> There are a bunch of very unique gift ideas on this page ! Notice that at least 5 of the 19 items are sold on Amazon , and sure enough- theyll make a commission when you click their link and go buy the " insanely clever " gift . <p> It appears that the majority of the items on their list are just regular , non-affiliate links . So its important to note that you should n't just be thinking of curated lists that you can stuff with affiliate offers . The key here is that it really is a fantastic list of clever gifts. - <p> Buzzfeed actually delivers on what they say , they just seamlessly integrate revenue generating opportunities into their content . <h> 4 . Tutorials <p> Tutorials and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like Wikihow- - are based solely on this idea . They show you how to do everything . <p> So how can you profit from tutorial posts on your website ? <p> By including affiliate links to the things you 'll need in order to do the job . <p> Now , HGTV is doing just fine without pulling in affiliate income from their " how to " guides , but- when affiliate revenue is at the heart of your income strategy , adding this simple step is a- no-brainer . <p> So anytime you are telling people how to do something , ask yourself : What **26;484;TOOLONG do they need for this project ? - <p> The answer might just provide you additional income- with very little effort . <h> Example Authority Sites <p> The nice thing about the more general ideas above is that they are applicable to a host of different niches and industries . <p> Is your site about dental care ? <p> You can review teeth whiteners , compare tooth brushes , curate a list of the candies so delicious they are worth getting a cavity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make homemade tooth paste ( while showing them where to buy the ingredients ) . <p> Your site is about car parts ? <p> Review snow tires , compare windshield wipers , curate a list of gifts for classic car lovers , and then show people how to change spark plugs ( while recommending your favorite set of spark plugs ) . <p> But what are some more specific ideas for a profitable website ? <p> Let 's talk about that . <h> Niche Site vs . Authority Site <p> The lines of what constitutes a " niche " site and an " authority " site have been blurred in recent years . One of the biggest differences is that niche sites are often hyper-focused on a very specific topic . Authority sites typically are still focused on a niche , but have a little more broad scope . <p> An example could be a site like DIY Ready , which would definitely be an authority in the DIY/homemade space . They talk about building furniture , crafts , jewelry , clothes , and basically anything you can think of that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ niche site- might be one that is focused specifically only on building DIY lanterns . Sure there are some different types of lanterns that can be built , but generally all their content is focused on this one topic . <h> Which is best ? <p> While there is often overlap in what could be classified as an authority site or a " niche " site , - its best to strike a balance . For instance , DIYReady is in a niche DIY projects . But that niche has enough depth to it that they can cover all kinds of things on their site . <p> So while you may not be setting out with the goal of building a huge site , having a topic that broad enough to scale into something bigger is a great way to go . <p> If you ca n't think of more than 20 different content ideas in your niche , it might just be too narrow . <h> Profitable Website Examples <p> Matt of Swim University explained his background and approach on the Side Hustle Nation podcast. - - Matt makes money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ space to other pool companies that want to be in front of his audience . <p> Survival life is a site developed by the folks at Digital Marketer . While you might think that a site that deals with doomsday preppers , surviving in the wild , etc. would n't amount to much , it now does well over $1M per month in revenue . <p> If you attended the Digital Marketer conference in 2015 , you learned that there is quite a science to their success . While they incorporate affiliate marketing , theyve also created their own survival knife and are masters at gathering leads and selling to them via email and paid advertising . <p> So despite the fact that Survivallife.com is much more than a one man show , there is still plenty to learn and implement , even if you are trying to start a profitable website on your own . <p> One example is a recent post , 5 Fathers Day Gifts for Preppers. - Its a short curation post , but in it they include a mix of products that you can buy from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The survival space is more broad that pool care , but is still a niche space overall one that Survival Life dominates . <h> Other Website Ideas <p> The list of possible niches at categories for a profitable website are nearly endless . If you are about to go at this for the first time , here are some general suggestions : <p> Try to- think of at least 50 content ideas . You do n't  have to get detailed at this point , but if you are struggling to get there then your topic might be a little too narrow . Can you broaden the scope slightly ? <p> Make sure you can find some good low competition keywords that you can try to rank for early on . Not every post on your site is going to be focused on a particular keyword , but- a good mix to shoot for is about 50% of your posts being keyword focused and 50% being " shareable " ( like the curated lists above ) . <p> Have ( at least ) rough plan for how you will monetize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when you search some of your keywords in Google ? If its affiliate offers , are there good products in your niche that you can promote and sell ? <h> Specific Profitable Website Ideas <p> With my last few points in mind , I 'll leave you with some other profitable website ideas- and- how you could incorporate the concepts- above into your strategy . I like to get into a niche where I have a few different angles I can take , and it all still makes sense with my topic . Here are some examples of what I mean : <h> Affordable Green Living <p> Review products targeted at this market of environmentally conscious home owners . <p> Use " newsjacking " to become an influencer and part of the conversation on stories that matter to this audience . <h> Final Thoughts <p> The beautiful thing about striking a balance of being broad enough , but still firmly inside of a niche is that you can pivot your content as you go . In other words , if your site is in the grooming niche and you find that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well , you can start focusing more and more on that topic and it still fits . <p> However , it you 'd started out as " the beard guy " then focusing on mustaches would seem a little out of place . <p> That 's not to say you cant do a site about beards only Im just saying that I 'd try to pick a topic with a slightly wider net , that has a couple of directions you can go and then you can really dial in on what seems to be working a few months down the road . <h> 3 Comments <p> Great blog ! Do you out there that I 'm totally overwhelmed .. Any recommendations ? Many thanks ! 
@@21641521 @1641521/ <h> Weebly vs . Squarespace A Fair Comparison <p> In todays world , you do n't  need special coding skills to create a professional looking website by yourself . Besides WordPress , which is pretty easy to use in its own right , there are a number of other user-friendly website building tools that are quite affordable . <p> Today , were going to compare Weebly vs . Squarespace two of the best options in this market . We 've also done a comparison of Weebly vs Wix if that 's more relevant to what you 're looking for .. <p> Certainly there will be no " loser " at the end of this comparison . Both of these are excellent- options if you need something that is simple to use and produces outstanding results for either e-commerce or a more- locally focused- small business . <p> If you 've already decided on one or the other , then we do n't  recommend you switch both platforms are good enough . Also , we 've got guides for both Squarespace SEO and Weebly SEO- to help you hit the ground running with your search @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There are a lot of similarities between Weebly and Squarespace . The target audience is very similar , and the features have a great amount of things in common . <p> For instance , each one will have you start by picking a theme as the design of your site . By default , all themes for Weebly and Squarespace are mobile-friendly , so you do n't  have to worry about how your site will look on smaller devices . <p> Weebly has more themes in total , but some of them are a bit dated looking . Theyve added quite a few newer , modern themes recently so you still have a couple dozen viable options . Here is a look at the Weebly theme page : <p> A few Weebly Themes <p> Squarespace has less themes overall , but all the ones you see are very sharp looking and modern . They do a fantastic job with the visual side of things . Here is a look at a few Squarespace themes : <p> With both tools , you can change themes at any time and it takes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a theme , you 'll also choose a name for your site and get walked through the initial setup process so you do n't  miss anything . You can also connect your own URL with both Squarespace and Weebly , so if you already have your website name and want to change your site management to either tool , it wont be a problem . <p> Once you 've done the basics , you can then move onto using the site editor to customize and create your site . <p> In both cases , you can take the " out of the box " themes and customize the CSS to get a look that is all your own . This can be done by yourself , or you can hire a designer that is familiar with the platform to do it for you . <p> Speaking of what is possible , here are some real small business sites built with Weebly : <h> Weebly vs . Squarespace Editing <p> Now let 's compare the site editor in both Squarespace and Weebly . Both are pretty user-friendly , but they operate differently . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little teardrop-like icons appear on the left side of your content . These represent the places you can insert a new content element : <p> When you click on the teardrop , you get a menu asking what you want to put there : <p> There are more available than shown in my image above , you just have to scroll down to see different choices like inserting products , calendars , maps , buttons and more . <p> Once you do insert a " content block " like a text area , you 'll be able to customize accordingly : <p> Since you start their theme with a bunch of " dummy " content already in place , its very simple to clone the pages you see and start changing out images and text , assuming you like the layout of all the content in the theme . <p> If you do n't  , you can simply add new pages and get rid of the existing ones to start from scratch and add the content you want . <p> Weeblys editor features a drag and drop interface , where you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them over to the page into the spot you want . The editor will look something like this : <p> Perhaps it is best demonstrated in this 1 minute intro video which shows the Weebly editor in action : <p> Weebly themes do n't  come with demo pages and content already in place , so you are always starting from scratch . <p> Whether this is a good thing or a bad thing is up to you to decide . <p> If you have a pretty good idea about where your content is going to go and what it will look like , then having a clean starting point- may save you some time . <h> Weebly vs . Squarespace SEO <p> I wont cover every detail here , but I 'll point out the key similarities and differences . <p> In both cases , you have complete control via the advanced settings of each pages title and description . This is important because when you are targeting specific keywords with your content , - including those keywords in your page title and page description are a good idea for your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meta description and the title give you an opportunity to let your content stand out in the search results . You can write copy that will interest the searcher and hopefully increase the likelihood that they will click on your page instead of the other 9 results listed by Google . <p> For image- optimization , you can obviously control the name of your images prior to uploading them . It also makes sense to use an image editing tool to reduce the file size before uploading . Minimizing the file size will help your pages load faster , which is a plus for your SEO efforts . <p> Google and humans like websites to be fast . <p> Once you 've done all of that , you 'll be able to customize your alt text in the settings in both site builders but the process is a little less than intuitive in Squarespace . <p> Key SEO Difference <p> While both Weebly and Squarespace give you a decent amount of control and allow you to do quite a bit of customization , there is one glaring difference that I uncovered while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ posts , Squarespace does n't  allow you to edit the meta description . Perhaps one day theyll fix that , but for now any blog post will get an automatic meta description shown in the search results . If you 're not clear on this , below is an image from Moz that shows what a meta description is : <p> If you like everything else about Squarespace , this is n't a deal breaker . However , if you 're going to be following a strategy of targeting different long tail keywords with your blog content ( like we recommend ) then having control over the blog page description would be really helpful . <h> Weebly vs . Squarespace Pricing <p> The good news is , both Weebly and Squarespace let you start for free . So do n't  worry about making a commitment upfront , you 'll have plenty of time to test dive your site before paying any money . In fact , Weebly let 's you have a free account forever if you 'd like you just have limited features and " Weebly " branding in your site footer . <p> Here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Weebly Pricing <p> and Squarespace : <p> Squarespace pricing <p> In both cases , if you are a business that sells products on your website then you 'll want the business package . The price is $25 per month on Weebly and $24 per month on Squarespace . <p> In both cases , you can sell an unlimited amount of products and there is no transaction fee charged when you sell . You will , however , have to pay the fees and percentage charged by your payment vendor . <p> Speaking of payment vendors , Squarespace uses Stripe exclusively . Weebly also gives you Stripe as an option , as well as Paypal , Authorize.net , and Square so there is some more flexibility if you already have a preferred credit card merchant . <p> As for the ecommerce tools themselves , adding products and getting setup is as simple as using the built-in editors of each system . Theyve both done a nice job of making this experience feel very similar to the normal page editing process . <p> For businesses that do NOT sell goods online , here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pricing : <p> The Weebly Pro package is $8 per month , and includes virtually everything youd get with the business plan minus the enhanced shopping cart features and other e-commerce specific items . So for $8 , you can build a site with an unlimited amount of pages and no size restrictions , while having access to all the design and page elements that Weebly offers . <p> For Squarespace , the biggest difference in the $8 and $16 per month plans is the limitation of having only- 20 pages on the $8 plan . - You can create an unlimited number of pages , blogs , and galleries on the $16 per month plan . <p> If you are building a small site with not much content and do n't  plan on adding to it , the $8 deal- may work for you . However , if you plan to build out a site with an information center with articles and other resources for your customers , then 20 pages will go really quickly . So in that case , youd need the $16 plan . <p> I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up needing more than 20 pages . In that case , you 'd be paying $8 per month on Weebly and $16 per month on Squarespace for similar functionality . <h> What To Do Next <p> If this website is for your business , making this choice is a pretty big deal . <p> You want something that looks professional , but is also easy for you and your team to keep updated and fresh . Both Weebly and Squarespace can do that job . <p> What you do n't  want to do is keep reading posts like this for months into the future and never make a decision ! <p> If you are n't  completely sold , then I 'd head over to Squarespace- - and start my 2 week free trial . Youll have to rebuild some content , but in the end if you 're happy with the site then you can set up your domain name and go live with a site on Squarespace . <p> Once you are up and running , its time to get traffic to your site . Click here to read more about how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what your industry , so you can increase your natural search engine traffic . <p> Hi : I 'm about to give weebly a whirl free , as you say , and then possibly go pro . Should I get domaine from them or name cheap ? ( Not sure about complexity of getting it pointed to weebly ? ) Also , are there any limitations as to amount of navigation , e.g. About , author , contact , advertise , contribute Etc . ? Is the weebly themes as customizable as scratch , but , which is easier to build ? And what about email , comments and contact publisher ( me ) options ? Thanks Howard 
@@21641524 @1641524/ <h> Our YouTube Marketing Strategy + Early Results <p> Spencer Haws , the creator of Long Tail Pro , has long shared very specific case studies and a play by play of the different ideas and tactics he s trying in his businesses over at the Niche Pursuits blog . <p> Today I thought wed do something similar on the Long Tail Pro blog by giving you a behind-the-scenes look at what were trying with Youtube marketing . <p> My hope is that you can- experiment with some of these strategies in your own business . <h> Our YouTube Inspiration <p> If you 've never heard of YouTube ( pronounced " U toob " ) <p> Kidding . <p> I know were really late to the YouTube party . After all , it is the 3rd most visited site on the web and considered to be the second largest search engine behind Google . <p> So the reasons for using YouTube as part of your marketing strategy are obvious , but we wanted to have some kind of plan or template to follow before spending much time with video marketing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ useful strategies for marketers . <p> After the event , I dove into some of the more in-depth trainings in their membership area called the " Lab . " Finally , I felt like we had a practical YouTube marketing strategy that would work for Long Tail Pro . <h> YouTube Strategy Highlights <p> The exact strategy actually came from a couple of guys who built a huge YouTube channel about basketball ( ILoveBasketballTV is their YouTube channel ) . Specifically , one guy who goes by " Coach Rock " would use YouTube to provide really specific tips on how to jump higher , shoot better , and much more . Because of their success , theyve actually started a blog at Get More Views which is all about getting more views on YouTube . <p> I really connected with this plan because it was so similar to what we talk to bloggers about with Long Tail Pro focus on more targeted , long tail searches and really hone in on those problems with your content . By doing that , you 'll tend to rank better for these terms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much lower competition for that exact search phrase . <h> Here were our takeaway steps that we wanted to implement : <h> 1 . Write Down Things Our Audience Wants To Know How to Do . <p> A big part of what the guys at Get More Views describe as a " bracelet and charm " approach is to find a general topic like " Blogging " which would be a " bracelet " or a bigger category . <p> Then , use YouTube suggested searches to get the longer tail versions of that which would be like the " charms " on a bracelet . <p> Here is a look at suggested searches for " Blogging : " <p> We took some time to identify 6 big category " bracelets " and then wrote out all the relevant long tail " charms " based on YouTube suggestions . <h> 2 . Create Specific Lead Magnets For Each Topic <p> Our main goal in using YouTube is to get new leads for Long Tail Pro . <p> Its not that our videos would n't be useful to current customers of Long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them on drawing new people into our marketing funnel . <p> Were trying to do that by offering a lead magnet that is super relevant to the content in the video . A lead magnet is something of value that you can offer someone ( usually for free ) in exchange for their email address . <p> I 'd done a blog post about making more as an Amazon Affiliate , and one of our topics ( AKA bracelets ) for YouTube is- Amazon Affiliates . Things like how to get started , how to implement with WordPress , etc . <p> So I took our blog post and transformed it into a formatted , downloadable pdf so we could offer it as a lead magnet on YouTube . <p> The idea is pretty simple ; if someone went to YouTube to search for videos like how to make money as an Amazon affiliate " and they find my video , there is a strong chance theyd be interested in a free report with tips on maximizing your earnings as an Amazon affiliate . <p> So before I recorded anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ downloads that would be my call to action . <h> 3 . Use Visual and Verbal Calls To Action <p> The main reason I created lead magnets ahead of time is because I wanted to verbally mention the call to action in my videos . <p> This was one tip from the guys at Get More Views that we really liked . <p> Many people put a link in the description of their video and use that as a sole call to action ( CTA ) : <p> We go a step further by ending every video by verbally calling people to action and pointing them to the link in the corner of the video ( a YouTube card ) or by clicking the link in the description . <p> The idea is that by doing both , people who like your video and really do want more related content simply cant miss it because I 'm instructing them on what to do next . <h> Tips For Your Videos <p> In addition to the high level process , we also picked up some tips for the videos themselves that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things we try to stick to : <h> One- Long Video , Many Short Videos <p> This is the " bracelet and charm " idea in practice. - Each- long tail keyword video we try to just share one tip with the viewer , rather than taking a deep dive into the topic . <p> In a recent recording , we did a video that was targeted at " marketing ideas for restaurants . " <p> I gave a brief intro of myself , then I shared one marketing idea from our list of 17 free marketing ideas- that I thought was most relevant for restaurants , and finally I made a brief call to action at the end that they could download 16 other ideas to market their business . Like before , this would take them to a landing page asking for their email , and then send them a PDF of all 17 ideas . <p> These " charm " or what Ive referred to as long tail keyword videos generally last 2 3 minutes . <p> Ideally , we want to offer a quick solution and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so they stick around ( which can help- your search position on YouTube . ) <p> For the overall bracelet video , you 'll typically put together a very long video that covers the entire topic . <p> For the marketing series , I did a 25 minute video that talks through about 10 of the 17 ideas , and still ended with a call to action to download the full list . <p> The idea behind this approach is that by covering all of the long tail charms of a topic , you are demonstrating some level of expertise . Then when you do a long video on the much more competitive larger topic , you tend to rank well because you 've got videos that thoroughly cover the entire topic . <p> This approach is why the guys at ILoveBasketballTV believe they rank number 1 for highly competitive terms like " How to shoot a basketball . " <h> 2 . CTA At Beginning and End <p> As mentioned earlier we use YouTube cards as our call to action . <p> Cards are newer than the ugly text boxes known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Plus , many expect that cards will eventually replace annotations altogether , so we do cards only . Here is a look at a " card " in our video : <p> Once you click on the card , it expands to show you the details : <p> Mine actually shows twice , because we put a card about 10 20 seconds into the video and then one near the very end , while I 'm verbally telling them to look for the link in the corner of the video . <p> This way , we can catch both people who might leave early and those who stick to the end and want more content . <h> 3 . Cover Your Keywords <p> Kind of like with on-page SEO for a blog post , every YouTube video we do has a keyword in mind . <p> So we make sure to include the primary keyword in the video title , video description , and the tags of the video . <p> For good measure , I usually have my video file name and my custom thumbnail image named something related to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I still want the title and description to be engaging and make people want to click on the video , but I want to make sure there is no doubt what the video is about . Here is an example in one video where we are targeting " Weebly SEO " <h> 4 . Custom Thumbnails <p> Something I always take the time to do is create a custom thumbnail for my videos , so I can overlay text on an image that will catch someones attention . <p> If you do n't  do that , YouTube will let you pick from some screen captures of your recording which usually are n't  something that grabs your attention in a sea of thumbnail images . <p> For instance , in the image above , check out our video thumbnail compared to the one right below us . <p> Both are on Weebly SEO , but when someone is scanning the page I like our chances of getting the visitor to click our video over theirs . <p> Use Canva- to add large text to that image . ( If your image @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their editor to add a " blur " effect . ) <p> Once you start uploading a video to YouTube , you 'll see the option to add this custom thumbnail . <h> 5 . Schedule Videos Consistently <p> Though we 've been recording in batches , we use YouTubes scheduling option to release videos every Monday , Wednesday , and Friday . This is optional of course , but was another suggestion we picked up from the guys at ILoveBasketballTV . Basically they say its better to release on a schedule to show YouTube that you are a long term content producer so pick a practical release schedule rather than dumping out one huge batch of videos . <p> I do n't  know if there is significant evidence to show that scheduling helps you get more views that doing a bulk release , but this is one of those things where we just took the word of somebody who has over 25 million views on their channel and went with it <h> Hows It Going ? <p> What Ive shared with you are mostly things that we learned from the Digital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shared as a strategy in the basketball space and added our own spin to it and used it in the website building/online marketing space . <p> Our first video went live about 1 month ago . <p> Currently we have 80 subscribers and a little over 12,000 views .

What advice would you share ? <h> 6 Comments <p> I love LTP and I am a platinum member of your software . I just want to add a small comment to the YouTube Cards as they are not that easy to apply . YouTube does n't  allow you to share your website link unless verified . The verifying procedure is n't that easy . So I could only link to videos from within my YouTube channel . <p> Hi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point we used the same Google account that has our Webmaster Tools verification setup , so when I started adding cards I did n't  have to do anything special to send traffic to longtailpro.com . <p> Hey , there is a tool for the keyword research from step 1 that helps to find the suggested Youtube Keywords incl . Search Volume / Competition in the pro version ( see http : //keywordtool.io/ ) . Would it be possible to implement this feature in Longtail Pro ? Thanks for your answer . <p> Hi Pico thanks for the comment . Long Tail Pro will focus on Google competition for the foreseeable future and not specifically YouTube . For this strategy , we just focused on the YouTube suggested searches for our high level topic . Also , YouTube videos often rank in search , so if you find a good keyword for Google you can absolutely do a YouTube video in addition to a blog post knowing that people are interested in that topic .

@@21641526 @1641526/ <p> While these statistics are encouraging if you plan to start a career as a personal trainer , there is still one problem : <p> How do you stand out from the crowd ? <p> As of 2012 , there were close to 300,000 personal trainers in the US . Some of those work full-time for a certain gym or health club , while others are doing their own thing and meeting with clients in their home or other locations . <p> Since personal training is a growing , but competitive space were going to give you a few simple marketing ideas that can help you attract and retain more clients . <h> 1. - Manage Your Personal Brand <p> Whether you are self-employed or you work for a local gym as a trainer YOU are the brand . <p> After all , people are looking for a " personal " trainer and theyll ultimately continue coming back because they like working with you . <p> So its important to use the internet to help create and monitor your personal brand . <p> What makes you unique and different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why would I pay all that money to train with you , specifically ? - <p> The First Step <p> If you are an independent trainer or you own your personal training company , you should first make sure you 've covered your bases online . <p> The first step is that you need to make sure that at the very least youve claimed your spot as a Google Business . <p> The result is that when people look for your business on Google , - or when they are searching more generic things like " trainers in YOUR CITY " you 'll have a better looking , more complete profile in Google like you see below : <p> In addition to having accurate and complete information about your personal training business , you can also do things like : <p> Respond to customer reviews left on Google <p> Add photos of your business or your work <p> Add accurate training- hours and location information <p> Put your best phone number and other contact information <p> Obviously Google is- the king of online search , but I 'd suggest that you do n't  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ places that people look for trainers , read reviews , etc. and you should make sure to stake your claim there as well . <p> Most let you claim a business for free , but may also offer some paid services which you are n't  obligated to buy . <p> Just by taking the time to claim what 's yours online , you 'll be a step ahead of many of your competitors who are too lazy to do it . <p> You 're not lazy , right ? <h> 2 . Answer Common Questions on Your Website <p> Again , this applies mostly if you have your own training company or are a self-employed trainer and not an employee of a branded gym . <p> Remember that you are the brand as a personal trainer . <p> While you might be completely sold on the benefits of working with a trainer , many of your prospective customers are not . They are probably skeptical and have questions like : <p> " Do I really need a personal trainer ? " <p> " Are personal trainers worth it ? " <p> " Difference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The list could go on and on , but you get the idea . <p> Many potential customers who have never heard of you ( yet ) are searching things like this in Google , and they are getting answers from someone online . <p> Why not be that someone ? - <p> If you want to pull in more free traffic to your website , then I 'd suggest answering all of these common questions on your website in the form of a blog post . <p> You do n't  have to give all written answers you could work in a combination of images , video , and text to educate your readers and warm them up to you personally . Below is an example from PopSugar which shows how to do a proper crunch in a video , and then has some text below with additional information . <p> Here are a few benefits to doing this on your website : - <p> The traffic is easier to get . By focusing on these long , specific questions with your content you have less competition . You could do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ workout routines , working out for different situations , like pregnant women or the elderly , etc. - We call these specific search terms- long tail keywords , and suggest that you focus on them early and often with your content . <p> It does n't  cost you money just time . Assuming you have a website already , were just talking about adding helpful content that is going to attract new customers to your site and introduce them to you . <p> You build trust and authority with your customers . By delivering well thought out and knowledgeable answers , you are proving that you are a fitness expert .

How can I build a site about that ? " <p> When you can quickly come up with a creative list of potential topics in a niche , you can then really expound on that using Long Tail Pro and other methods to build out a specific list of low competition keywords you plan to target . <h> Making Connections in Your Niche <p> In addition to coming up with a general direction for your site , I believe that making connections inside of your niche/industry is a huge part of building a successful brand online . <p> Its tough to grow into a bigger authority site while- on an island , disconnected from your niche community . <p> You need to engage your community by reaching out to influencers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , guest posting opportunities , and simple " heads up " emails to let them know when you mention or quote them in a blog post . <p> If you are sending a generic-feeling , template email to a busy influencer in your space and are hoping for a positive result , do n't  hold your breath . <p> Most likely your email will be lost in a sea of hundreds or thousands of others that do n't  really stand out . <p> Instead , look for a unique angle you can take , like reading their " about me " page and finding something you share in common and try contacting them about that first to strike up a conversation . <p> Another approach could be politely letting them know about a mistake on their site like a broken link or an image that is n't loading . Again , its a great way to get a reply from them and hopefully make a connection . <p> If you 're a creative person , youll- likely have a much easier time making beneficial connections inside of your niche . <h> 2. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of money set aside to pay content writers , you 'll likely be doing the vast majority of the writing for your site early on . <p> Because of that , you need to be at least a decent writer . <p> If not , you 'll find it difficult to get people to stick around on your site and read related articles , opt-in to your lead magnets , click on your affiliate links , etc . <p> If people land on- your site and quickly hit the " back " button , this is known as a " bounce " and may actually have a negative impact on your site in the search engine rankings , since Google is able to see how often visitors actually interact with your site . <p> The good news is , - writing for the web is quite different than writing research- papers for school . <p> Its all about getting your message across and being engaging , which really overlaps with the creativity trait once again . <p> No teacher will be grading your niche site writing , so you really just need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If that 's using a very casual and humorous writing style that would have flunked you out of your college writing class , so be it ! <p> Long story short - if you 're creative by nature and a decent writer , you 'll be just fine . <p> What If I Hate To Write ? - <p> If sitting down and writing for hours at a time is n't something you love to do , then its helpful to- use a mix of content styles that do n't  involve huge amounts of original writing from you . <p> One example from their list is " The Curated Post " where you pull together content and ideas from around the web and put them all together in a blog post on your site . These can be really useful pieces of content , and they do n't  require you to sit down and start writing something from scratch . <p> Other ideas like an " interview post " where you are basically just asking questions of an expert in your niche and an " infographic post " where you feature an awesome visual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much laborious writing . <h> 3 . Persistence <p> Look , if you are hoping to build a niche site from scratch and watch it grow into a money-making asset its going to take some time . <p> To stick with the growing analogy , you 'll be doing a whole bunch of sewing before you do ANY real reaping . <p> I think the persistence required is especially tough for creative people . <p> I 'd say of the 3 , its the hardest part for me . <p> Why ? <p> Because when creativity is a strength of yours , you likely see hard-to-resist opportunities all around you . <p> Some have called this " shiny object syndrome . " <p> So today you are on the niche site bandwagon and you buy a domain , start creating blog posts , and then next week you read about somebody making money through Amazon FBA and decide to create a new product to sell . <p> Suddenly your 2 week old niche site is a distant memory and never does much of anything . <p> Ive been there ( many times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ niche site is going to be successful , you have to be committed to sticking with it and planning and creating content long after it stops being fun . <p> If your site is brand new , itll likely take several months to really start ranking and pulling in organic traffic from Google thanks to the sandbox effect . <p> There are things you can do to expedite success , like picking up traffic via social media and other sources , but generally things will start slow so be prepared for that . <h> Overrated Traits <p> Since I outlined 3 essential traits that you need to build a successful niche site , I thought I 'd share some thoughts about traits that are overrated ; meaning that they can help , but they are far from essential . <h> 1 . Web Design Experience <p> If you can check the box on the 3 essentials above but have avoided starting your own niche site because you do n't  know how to design one I 've got some good news for you <p> A successful niche site is n't really about design , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ connection between the two you cant create a site that looks like it was built in 1997 and think you are going to be a smashing success . However , its easier than ever before to create a professional looking website without any special design skills . <p> There are plenty of places to get free and paid WordPress themes , but my favorite has become Thrive Themes. - <p> Shane and his team have developed nice , simple themes and a content builder that makes building beautiful blog posts very easy . <p> On the flip side , someone with design experience could create the best looking niche site on the internet but if they pick a bad niche , do poor- keyword research , and do n't  excel at content creation theyll really struggle to make money from the site , which is the ultimate goal . <p> So if you 're a designer by trade that 's great , but it certainly is n't a prerequisite to success . <h> 2 . Being An Expert In Your Niche <p> This is another one that is often overrated , causing some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if they " are enough of an expert " on their given topic . <p> I 've got good news for you as well there is plenty of room on the internet for many different levels of expertise . <p> There are- always going to be people who know more than you , but that should n't stop you from- sharing what you know . <p> In fact , Pat Flynn of Smart Passive Income started his first online business when he was anything but an expert in the topic . <p> According to his story , he was studying for a LEED certification exam and felt overwhelmed by the material . So he started a blog to organize and record the things he was learning . Eventually , this turned into one of the most prominent online resources for people studying for this exam and ultimately was the first online success for Pat . <p> Was Pat an expert in LEED certification when he started the site ? <p> Not even close . <p> But he was learning , and documenting the things he learned . <p> When you think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more helpful to someone else who was preparing for this exam than reading information from the foremost expert in LEED certification . <p> Why is that ? <p> Because Pat was speaking the same language as his fellow students , and the content was perfect for their current stage in the process of exam preparation . <p> The same holds true for you . <p> You might be interested in a niche but know hardly anything about it . Why not use your niche site to document things as you learn them , so you can help teach others who are also just beginning ? <p> Remember , its all about connecting with your audience so do n't  let your lack of " expert status " stop you from giving it a shot . <h> Ready To Get Started ? <p> I truly believe that anyone who is creative , persistent , and at least a decent writer can create a successful niche site . <p> Being a designer or a true subject matter expert are nice bonuses , but not essential for your success . 
@@21641528 @1641528/ <h> When Ignoring Keyword Search Volume Is A Great Idea <p> When you are doing keyword research , its easy to get wrapped up in search volume . <p> On the surface it makes sense . <p> If a keyword is only getting searched 10 times per month , is it really worth the effort ? <p> Today I 'm going to make the argument that in- some cases , it absolutely is. - <p> Let 's talk about when throwing the search volume out the window is a great idea . <h> The Big Dilemma <p> When I wrote a recent post about choosing a niche , I went through the process and showed some keywords that I 'd focus on if I were to create a site in the " tiny house " niche . Some of those keywords had only 10 , 20 , or 40 searches per month : <p> In the comments and via email I had a couple people ask the obvious question why would you target a keyword that has a search volume that low ? <p> Its a very fair question and I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about low search volume . <h> 1 . When its an excellent buyer keyword <p> This is when a keyword is right down your alley , and your product or service is the answer to their question . <p> For instance , if you sell an acne cream and someone searches " what are the best acne creams ? " would n't you love to own that top spot in Google ? If you 're using a keyword research tool like LTP , this kind of keyword might pop up in LTP as a 10 monthly search KW ( or you might find it with an outside tool like Ubersuggest ) and even though its only got 10 monthly searches , its probably a KW that converts extremely well for someone who 's selling acne cream . This is especially true if you 've come up with a great idea for a profitable website already and you expect that each visitor to your site will be worth a lot to you . <p> Of course you would . That 's because that person is very likely looking to buy acne cream . <p> Therefore , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ searched a few times per month . If you can rank well for that keyword , you will be very likely to get sales directly from that traffic , so it makes sense to target that keyword with your content . <p> After all , we believe that one thing personal trainers ( and many other business owners ) should be doing is using their website content to pull in free , organic traffic from the search engines . One of the most affordable and quickest ways to do that is to target the right keywords with your content something Long Tail Pro is designed to help with . <p> So in this case , we really do n't  care that not many people are searching this term . Besides , there are always very close variations of keywords like " marketing ideas for trainers " or " personal trainer marketing ideas " that mean the same thing and usually if you can rank for one , you can rank for all of them . <p> We feel like if we can rank near the top for it , well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of personal trainers who have probably never heard of Long Tail Pro . <p> The same goes for you when you find your best " buyer keywords , " do n't  worry about a low search volume . <h> 2 . When The Topic Just Makes Sense <p> The second- situation where low search volume does n't  matter is when the topic just makes sense for you to write about . <p> It does n't  even have to be a " buyer keyword " it may just be some information that your audience will get value from . <p> Perhaps its something obscure to 99.9% of the world , but its a topic that your readers/customers really care about . <p> In that case , you should absolutely create the content regardless of search volume , keyword competitiveness , or any other metric . <p> A Personal Example <p> On one of my niche websites , I 've found that sometimes following this approach works out better than you could ever imagine anyway . <p> If you read our blog , you may already know that my first attempt at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ created the site to help people going to Major League Baseball games and show them ways to save money and cut corners at all the different ballparks . <p> When I started the site in 2008 , I was newly married and childless . This meant that I went to a lot of Cincinnati Reds games . <p> As time went by , we- started having kids left and right <p> Now I 've got 3 little boys that call me dad , and I do things like you see on the left instead of going to so many- Reds games . <p> When I did go to baseball games , I quickly- learned that going to games with babies and small children is a much different process than going by yourself or with other adults . <p> So the thought occurred to me , " I should write about taking kids to a baseball game ! " - <p> After all , certainly other people have questions about the rules at various stadiums and would be looking for advice on things like : <p> Does my kid need a ticket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I bring in my own snacks for kids ? <p> And on and on <p> There was only one problem : <p> I could n't find a good keyword that indicated people were actually searching for this information . <p> In fact , most of the keywords related to this topic looked something like this with ZERO or maybe 10 searches per month : <p> I figured that even if not many people saw it , the readers of my site who did would really appreciate- everything they need to know being put into one place rather than going to a bunch of places to get the information . <p> What happened after I published this page was what really surprised me <h> Much To My Surprise <p> Ill be honest and say that I do n't  spend as much time as I should on my site , so I 've not put much effort into building an email list or doing email outreach to promote my blog . It basically runs on autopilot and is a pretty consistent performer during the baseball season as far as traffic and revenue . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taking kids to a baseball game , I did n't  email a bunch of people or do any special promotion for- it . <p> I did what Brian Dean calls the " Publish and Pray " approach and just made the page live on my site . <p> From there , I moved into the number 1 spot for what I considered my target keyword ( as you can see in the screenshot above . ) <p> But given the negligible amount of search volume for that phrase , I was really surprised at the amount of organic traffic I was receiving to my guide . <p> To make a long story short , I 've had just over 60,000 page views on this guide so far in 2015 which is more than double any other page on my site and accounts for almost 15% of my total traffic . <p> As with most of my content , about 51,000 of those views came from organic search traffic from a primary keyword that shows a search volume of " 0 . " <p> How is that possible ? <h> Why It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this page becoming a big source of traffic and revenue for my site was my plan all along . <p> I just wrote it because as a baseball fan with kids , I knew it would be helpful to me to have a resource like this and I could n't find one elsewhere so I wrote it . <p> Ill also be honest to say that I cant give a complete , A-Z explanation of why the pages gets as much traffic as it does , but I can share some of the important factors : <h> 1 . Its Super Thorough <p> The page ended up with over 8,000 words on it , which is probably the longest piece of content Ive ever written . <p> I went to every teams website and searched their FAQ for any information that pertained to kids , and then I summarized it or quoted it in my guide , with a link back to that page on the teams website . It is n't the prettiest guide , but I listed every team in alphabetical order so you can quickly scroll down , find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need to know . <p> By doing this , I pull in traffic for all kinds of keywords that I never even intended to rank for . <p> From what I can see , virtually all of those have really low search volume as well but it all adds up . <p> In fact , I was doing a little unscientific experiment while writing this and just searching Google for things I 'd like to know as a parent taking my kid to their first baseball game and again and again my guide is near the top because I 've covered the topic in such great depth . <h> 2 . The Topic Is Very Deep <p> By " deep " I mean that there are TONS of questions people have on this topic . There are 30 different stadiums , all with slightly different rules and policies , and parents are taking kids to their first baseball game all the time . <p> I 'm nearly certain that a- topic like this has plenty of odd , unique searches happening all the time and when it comes down to it , my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this topic . <p> I suppose I could have created one blog post per stadium , such as " Taking Kids To A Yankees Game " etc. but it seemed like it made more sense to roll it up in to one big guide which was- the right decision for my site . <h> How You Can Make It Work <p> There is no magic formula here . <p> But if you 've been avoiding a topic on your blog that your gut tells you would be a hit with your audience , but your keyword data says hardly anyone is searching for that topic write it anyway. - <p> Remember , your site is for humans first . <p> So if you 've got your finger on the pulse of your readers- and your instincts say its a good idea go for it ! The same can be said for those buyer keywords we talked about do n't  let low search volume scare you away . <p> I cant guarantee that itll turn into a high traffic post for you , but at the very least you can deepen your relationship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do have . <p> Remember that people search Google for all kinds of things so if you are covering a wide topic , really dig in and make your resource the best available and you 'll be surprised by all the different search terms that bring you traffic . <p> Best of luck ! <p> sunoteReady to start finding keywords ? - Click Here to take a 10 day free trial of Long Tail Pro and find out what your customers are searching Google for . /sunote <h> 30 Comments <p> Bob on November 19 , 2015 at 9:22 pm <p> Great article . And I can see why your baseball article gets so many hits . What do you recommend the article length be for these keywords that get 0-100 searches per month ? Just curious if you 've done experimenting with it ? <p> Honestly in many cases they do n't  need to be that long assuming that the KC score ( competition ) is low . In different situations , Ive ranked on page 1 with 700 words or so . For instance , I 'll do something like Chris @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own written content afterward : http : **34;512;TOOLONG Ive been using this for some sites to get quality content up faster than starting from scratch . <p> However , in my example here from the baseball site it just happened to be a really deep topic with so many different things to cover so I just did one enormous page . <p> Sorry no set answer for you , just the dreaded answer of " it depends " <p> Hey Jake ! Great read ! Ive been targetting a lot of those low search volume keywords as well since you 're right , they hardly have any competition and if you can provide value while getting buyers to your site then why not ? <p> Quick question for you : For those low search volume and low competition keywords how long would you estimate it takes to get onto the first few results on Google ? I know its not an exact science whatsoever but you would say a 1-3 month timeframe is appropriate ( with great on-page SEO and a good backlink profile ) ? <p> Yes , I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pro site , that last blog post I mentioned where we targeted " marketing ideas for personal trainers " we typically show up ranked in the 30s within 24 hours of posting which is crazy to me , but we have a pretty authoritative domain/brand . But when we ascend to the top , it usually takes a couple of months or so ( and of course a top ranking is never a guarantee ) . <p> I started that site in 2008 and really had no clue what I was doing . It took quite awhile to get reviews up for all 30 stadiums , then I added some blog content and special pages like that guide for kids . I 'd say its been fairly auto-pilot since 2011 , meaning I do random small updates to the existing stadium guides but I spend almost no time on it . I probably should/could be more aggressive with it just seem to always start new projects ! <p> With the site I 'm currently working on , we bought the domain about a year ago and added just a handful of articles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and added about 40 strong blog posts in 6 weeks and it has really taken off and could be on " auto-pilot " if we wanted , but were really trying to maximize revenue and growth while we have momentum . <p> The I did n't  join the affiliate programs that make almost all the money on that site until about 3 years into it , so before that I got a little bit of revenue from Google Adsense but I was hardly making any money . I coulda/shoulda made more money earlier on if I 'd been smarter . <p> When I look at monthly search volume numbers , I simply cant believe the numbers that Google is sharing with us . <p> According to Google stats , there are 3.9 billions per DAY which equates to 117 billions per month . Granted , those numbers are worldwide but still , are we suppose to believe that , in the entire US market , there are only 10 folks to type " marketing ideas for trainers " ? I simply to believe that ! <p> Right that 's an interesting point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go off of , so that 's why in the " taking kids to a baseball game " example I kind of had a gut feeling that more people would be interested in that topic . <p> So I do n't  know if its inaccurate/old data from Google , or if there are just so many different ways you can phrase that keyword that none of them add up to really high search volume . <p> One of the most interesting articles on this low-volume searches . It proves that any post could be a winner if well written and there is a market out there . I do n't  think the google number are always true . I have a similar experience too with one of my posts . The visits by day are equal to the google predicted searches by month = Similar to your case I wrote the article without SEO in mind , more as a result of passion and I had a big surprise . One thing I noticed is that if I write a similar article maybe for another geographical area ( I have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well too , as Google " thinks " I am a guru in that specific super-niche subject .

Cheers Stef <p> I 'm a huge advocate of this Bottom-Up keyword approach . *Deliberately* going after low-volume terms is a way to get rapid traction on a young site or plug holes in an established one . <p> I 've built entire niche sites around low-volume 10-30 searches per month terms that few others would intentionally or aggressively pursue . That includes terms that your gut instincts tell you there 's interest in , but are n't  necessarily reflected in the numbers . <p> Nail enough minor long-tails , and you WILL get many onto Page 1 . You 'll get the click-through , the onsite dwell and exploration , establish your authority and soon the site will open-up to more medium and short-tail terms that are underserved almost automatically . <p> Hi Jake , thanks so much for the post . I 've really been battling with low search volumes . The market am targeting has really low search volumes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like SEO in Kenya and content marketing have less than 1000 searches per month in Kenya . But nevertheless I 've written tons of posts on these keywords . I think what i take with me from your post is that : just follow your gut when you feel your audience needs some piece of information write it even if the search volumes are low and writing quality content ( which is long enough , right ? ) can end up attracting traffic for different keywords with low search volumes until it all adds up.Thanks Jake , its my first time pumping into your blogs but will definitely be stopping by again . <p> My baseball site is monetized through a couple of affiliate programs , one for when people buy tickets to games and one for when they buy parking ahead of time on a site called Park Whiz . So the site does n't  make " quit your job " money , but its certainly profitable . <p> Excellent I write a lot but typically focus my articles on keyword volume . I have seen what you describe though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ focused article . I always chalked it up lengthy articles hitting a lot of LSI keywords <p> I just bought Long Tail Platinum due to Pat Flynns suggestion , and man does this post make me feel better . For the past 5 days I have been going crazy trying to fit blog post ideas into the low competition/high search volume keywords , and nothing felt right . Thanks so much for this , I feel better about going after lower search volumes ! <p> Hi Jake , I would like to add something on based on my own experience . While Google own Google Keyword Planner , they only show the approximate searches per month . They are never accurate especially if the keywords are n't  popular ( get searched less than 100 times per month ) . I can tell you ( based on a few keywords of mine ) that if Google Keyword Planner is showing you an average search volume of 10 , you will most likely get around 200500 visits per month if you rank on the first spot . Of course , this is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Another cool fact is that if you are selling your own product/service or promoting a high payout product , you get to earn decent amount of money just by ranking for keywords less than 100 searches per month . To give you an example , I helped one of my clients rank for a local term with 30 average searches per month in the wedding niche . Every sales net him approximately $1k ( depends on the package ) . Guess what ? We estimate that this particular keyword brings in $5k per month for the past 6 months = <p> In short , I feel that ranking for low competition keyword is the way to go since you do n't  need to invest too much resources in link building . More importantly , most well-funded SEOs are n't  going to target these terms leaving you a big heck of opportunity .

First on the list was " Stand in your customers shoes . " - <p> His point was to look beyond just your direct relationship to your customer and think about their " full range of choices . " <p> More than likely , - the product or service you provide is part of a bigger picture for your customer . <p> Professional Photography Example <p> I like to use realistic examples because I feel that it puts things at a practical level . <p> If you are a photographer , people do n't  often get professional photos done because they took their kids out to lunch that day . <p> No , usually they are looking for photos of a big event or milestone in their life that they need captured . Weddings , engagements , and maternity photos come to mind . <p> If Engagement Photos Were Always This Amazing <p> So as a local wedding photographer , you have an opportunity to share things you 've learned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : <p> As a photographer in Knoxville you 've probably done your fair share of weddings . Why not write a post about your 9 favorite wedding venues in Knoxville , or in all of Tennessee ? ( Long Tail Pro can help you determine exactly what people are searching for most often ) . <p> Maybe you have experiences with caterers that you would recommend . Or you 've got some ideas about wedding favors that your potential customer would be interested in . <p> None of these things are talking directly about you and your services . <p> However , these are examples of things that your customer is also looking for . <p> So much of blogging is building trust with your audience. - In fact , Mitt Ray conducted a survey on this topic and found that the top way to add credibility to your blog is quality content . <p> Imagine that ! <p> So by thinking like your customer and blogging about the things that are important to them , you are building trust and credibility in their eyes .

Often the goal of blogger outreach is to get that person to share your great blog post with their audience . <p> However , coldly approaching an influencer in your industry- and asking for a favor via email works about as well as it would in real life . <p> Were going to hang with the professional photographer example of the rest of the post . <p> What if you approached the most well known photographer you can think of and said " Hey ! my name is Jake . here 's my latest photo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up in your gallery so your audience could find out about me ? " <p> How do you think that would go ? <p> You must first remember that you are talking to another human being , which means they have feelings just like you . <p> In our example , what if you approached the famous photographer by saying something like " Hi Katie , my name is Jake . I 've admired your work for so long , this is such an honor . In fact , your photo of the great caribou migration of 1996 is really what inspired me to get into this business . " <p> Which introduction would be better received ? <p> The second introduction is personal , sincere , and complimentary . It is a conversation starter . Maybe you get to talk to Katie for a few minutes , ask her opinion on a few things , and then exchange cards at the end . <p> She may never hang your photo up in her gallery , but the chances of that happening are far greater in the second approach . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about how to do blogger outreach the right way . <p> 2 of the key things are to first , be personal . <p> At least know the persons first name for heavens sake ! Remember the " Dear Webmaster " guy ? <p> Do n't  be him . <p> Try to avoid asking for a favor in your first email . Or if you do , do something for them first . <p> Let 's go back to our photographer example . <p> I mentioned the importance of writing about what your customers want to know . Perhaps you 've learned about some of the best catering companies in your area from all the weddings you 've shot over the years . <p> You proceed to write about all your experience and then highlight a couple of companies that you 've seen do great catering work . <p> After you 've published this blog post , you need to reach out to those catering companies . It could be as simple as this : <p> Hi Company Owner Name , <p> How are you doing ? This is and I 'm just writing to let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wedding photographer in the area and every time Ive seen your company- do a wedding , they are always professional and the food is excellent. - <p> In fact , I just included you in- my favorite caterers in- Knoxville and thought you 'd like to check it out . <p> LINK <p> Keep up the great work ! <p> YOUR NAME <p> sunoteFREE BONUS : - Download 3 More Email Templates- to get you started with effective outreach. /sunote This is what Brian Dean simply calls the " heads up " email. - You are simply reaching out to someone that you mentioned , featured , or quoted and letting them know about it . The odds of them finding it otherwise are probably very slim , so you need to make sure they see it . As I said earlier , were dealing with humans . How do you think that email would make the catering company feel ? I 'd say that theyd be proud of their employees and grateful that you took the time to pay them a compliment . What 's in it for me ? You 're happy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feeling all warm and fuzzy because you paid them a nice compliment . But you may be asking , " what 's in it for me ? " Often what happens when you do outreach like this is that the company decides to share it . They may repost it on their website , share it on Facebook , or just email it to a bunch of people to show everyone that they were listed as one of the best catering companies in Knoxville . When they share it , that is great news for you ! First , links back to your website are important for your Google rankings ; particularly links from similar companies and from authoritative sources . The idea is simple . If the New York Times links out to a website in one of their stories , Google trusts that the New York Times would n't be linking to some terrible , irrelevant site . So by definition , that link you have from NYT is a pretty big deal its like a vote of confidence for you in the eyes of Google . On the local @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some national sites in your field is a great thing for your business . Besides the " Google " part of all this , there is the human side . Remember when we talked about the " bigger picture " for your customer ? If a local caterer becomes a fan of you and shares your link on their site , what kinds of people do you think are looking for a caterer ? My guess is people who are planning special events like weddings and other banquets . That sounds a lot like your customers .

@@21641542 @1641542/ <h> Weebly vs . WordPress Which is Better For Your Website ? <p> If you 've been thinking about starting a website , there are tons of options out there for creating and managing that site . <p> Today I 'm going to compare 2 popular , but very different solutions . <p> Welcome to Weebly vs . WordPress . <p> Ill start by saying that I 've used both of these platforms for years , and Ive successfully grown and maintained high traffic websites using each one of these . So I feel as if I can deliver a pretty fair comparison of the 2 systems and hopefully help you decide which is best for you . <p> Ill also say that there is no " loser " here , at least in my mind . Both systems are viable options for running your website , they are just different and cater to different needs . Let 's look at some of the details : <h> Brief Weebly Overview <p> I am going to give a brief overview of both systems , so you can get the high level idea . I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ differences not doing a full review of each . <p> Weebly is a website builder that is designed to make the process of creating and customizing a website very simple . <p> You start by going to Weebly.com and creating a free account , and moments later you are building your website using their online design tool . It is a " drag and drop " interface , which means that you click on elements like a title , text block , image , etc. and drag it to where you want it on your website . <p> Weebly is built with the beginner in mind , but it has really grown up over the years to allow for a full online store and e-commerce solution for those who need it . As for ease of use , it just does n't  get much simpler than Weebly . <p> I really believe that the average internet user , who has never- even considered creating a website , can jump into Weebly and know what to do within minutes . <p> You start by choosing a theme , which is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and make customizations until you 're happy , and publish your site . By default , your site is on a subdomain of Weebly such as SITE.weebly.com . You can connect your own domain with Weebly , so its just " Yoursite.com . " <h> Brief WordPress Overview <p> For our purposes , we are focused on comparing Weebly to WordPress.org not WordPress.com . <p> WordPress.com is primarily a free blogging platform which uses a subdomain like SITE.wordpress.com . If you want to upgrade to using your own domain and more file storage , etc. then you 'll pay about $99 per year . <p> WordPress.org is " both free and priceless at the same time . " They say that over 60 million people have built their websites with this free software , and that number is growing by the day . <p> This distinction between WordPress.com and WordPress.org was very confusing to me at first . For the rest of this article , when we talk about WordPress we are talking about WordPress.org . <p> To use it , you need to first buy both a hosting plan and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ domain names at 1and1.com and do my hosting with Bluehost . I chose Bluehost because it was affordable , and it has a " 1-click " WordPress install . It was a very simple process . <p> Whatever hosting you go with , you 'll need to install WordPress on that host so you can start building your website . <p> WordPress has a default theme , but there are tons of 3rd party companies and designers that create both free and paid themes that you can use . This will set the main look of your website . Once you 've logged in , the WordPress admin site looks like this : <p> You 'll begin adding pages and posts , as well as making other customizations to the site . Since you 've already got your domain and hosting in place , as you publish pages and posts they will go live immediately . <p> As you need to add functionality or other features , you can search a marketplace of " plugins " that are also developed by 3rd parties . These can help with e-commerce , SEO , website speed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really help you customize your site . <h> Weebly vs . WordPress : Key Differences <p> I 'm now going to rundown some of the key differences in these 2 platforms . As mentioned earlier , depending on the situation either one of these could be right for you . <h> Ease of Use <p> I 'll say it again : it just does n't  get much simpler than Weebly . <p> There are some other drag and drop style editors available , and you can read more about those here . However , Weebly offers a nice mix of simplicity and advanced features . You can really do quite a bit with it if needed , but if you just need something simple and straightforward you can do that too . <p> On the other hand , I do n't  think WordPress is difficult to use . <p> I- had used Weebly before WordPress , and I used to think that WordPress would be some big blank page where I would have to start typing in HTML code . Fortunately , that is n't the case at all . <p> It is n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything is , it is n't difficult to create blog posts and pages . However , there is a little bit of a learning curve when you 've never used WordPress before . I think people whove used WordPress for awhile may take these for granted , but some of the set up steps you should take are n't  obvious , and WordPress does n't  automatically walk you through them . <p> For instance : - <p> 1 . Finding your way to general settings to put in your site name and description <p> 3 . Changing your theme and customizing it , including whether to show latest blog posts or a static front page <p> Again , they are n't  hard to do , but if you are new to this and do n't  have any help you might not even think to look for these kinds of things . <p> The difference in Weebly is that the wizard walks you though choosing a theme for your site , adding your site name , and doing those very basic things before you get into the website editor . <p> Once you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very intuitive and simple to use . You also have a much less complicated menu of things to do , like Build , Design , and Settings . <p> Weebly has a much clearer path to starting as a beginner and getting a good looking site with all the bases covered up and live . So when friends or acquaintances- ask me what they should use to build their website , I always suggest that they start with Weebly. - <p> For most people that I talk to , explaining about hosting and installing WordPress just sounds intimidating and is more than they want to deal with . These are n't  " website people . " They are very small business owners who need an online presence , people starting a site for a personal cause or interest , etc . <p> Sure , there are things they could do in WordPress that they cant do in Weebly , but most beginners would n't know how to do those things anyway . They are n't  trying to be a website building expert , they just want something that looks professional and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that sounds like- you , then I wholeheartedly recommend Weebly . <h> Full Customization <p> In both Weebly and WordPress , you can access things like your CSS file if you need to make some design edits to your theme . - However , when talking about " full customization " I really mean the availability of themes and plugins that you have in WordPress . <p> Weebly has dozens of themes to choose from , and probably 30 of those fit in well with 2015 standards . Some themes were designed several years ago and look a little dated in my opinion . <p> Besides Weeblys free themes , there are very few 3rd parties that develop themes specifically for Weebly . DivTagTemplates is one example of a theme maker that focuses on developing for Weebly . <p> With WordPress , some themes are available for free and others come at a cost . You can also hire a designer from Elance or elsewhere to create a fully customized site for you . Because WordPress is so widely used , there is never any shortage of designers and developers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Its kind of like an app developer , would you rather spend your time creating an app for iOS ( Apple devices ) or for Windows phone ? Wherever the majority of users are , the majority of developers and creators will be there also . <p> There are over 37,000 of these add-ons available , and they can do just about anything you can think of . For instance , I use plug-ins that are designed for SEO and help you make sure that your pages are focused on your target keyword . <p> Another plug-in I 've used when creating a site that uses Adsense to monetize is called " Quick Adsense- " that automatically drops your ads into the same places on all of your pages and posts . This is a huge time-saver if you 're running a big Adsense site . <p> In Weebly , I 'd have to put in that Adsense code on each page that I want to display ads . <p> There are plugins to help you control comment SPAM , increase social sharing , and much more . Weebly has a bunch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get they do n't  have this concept of 3rd party plugins to add to the base functionality . <p> Depending on the kind of site you 're running , having plugins at your disposal could make a huge difference . <h> Weebly vs . WordPress : Similarities <h> Weebly vs . WordPress Pricing <p> I mentioned WordPress tagline earlier , that it is both free and priceless at the same time . Although it is free to use , it is n't free to host your website or buy a domain name . Those costs do n't  come from WordPress , but when you think about it from the " total cost to run a website " perspective , using WordPress does n't  mean you have a free website . <p> For a shared hosting service like Bluehost , you 'll pay about $10 per month for the middle tier package . You may find a better introductory rate ( currently $6.95 ) , but to get the lesser " per month " price , you have to pay for 2 or 3 years in advance . <p> I 've found Bluehost to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There are more premium hosting options for WordPress like WP Engine which starts at $30 per month . <p> Domain names are a fixed cost , no matter where you build your website . Some website building services will sweeten the deal and give you a free domain for one year if you sign up with them , but you can typically count on $15 per year to own a domain . I use 1and1 because they often run special deals where you can get the first year at a very steep discount . <p> So although WordPress is free to use , your other costs will likely run you $8 $12 per month for a domain and budget hosting . <p> Weebly offers a free plan , but this is n't a viable option for most businesses . You 'll at least need the starter plan , and if you are an e-commerce ( sell goods on your website ) business then you 'll want the business plan . Here is a look at Weebly pricing : <p> I 'd say that most people would do very well with the Pro plan , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pro and Business is some more advanced e-commerce features . So if you do n't  sell products directly on your website , then Pro would definitely work for you . <p> Keep in mind that this price includes your hosting , but you still need to purchase a domain name like we talked about before . <p> So assuming you go with Pro , and you buy a domain name separately , you 'll average- about $9-10 per month to run a Weebly website . <h> SEO Principles <p> I 'm listing SEO principles as a similarity of Weebly and WordPress because the basics do n't  change . <p> You can certainly build a high ranking website that pulls in tons of Google traffic on both Weebly and WordPress . <p> I 've done it on both and still do it today . <p> So the idea that you cant do SEO on Weebly or that Weebly is " bad for SEO " just is n't the case. - To me " SEO " is all about being found in the search engines , and the process you go through to make that happen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , right ? <p> This is n't a full course on SEO , but one of our key themes- is using low competition long tail keywords- to focus your content on . This is more about the keyword research and the content strategy than it is your website builder . <p> You can still do just about everything you need to do on your page to be optimized for your keyword . In fact , I put together a full guide to Weebly SEO right here if you 'd like more detail . <p> In WordPress , you can use the Yoast SEO plugin- to make sure you are covering all your bases in each post . This helps you stay focused on the basic principles of SEO , but the concepts can all be applied to a page built on Weebly or another site builder . <p> No doubt that the SEO settings in Weebly look different than WordPress , but the concept is the same . I can customize my page titles , descriptions , alt tags , page content , and more in both I just take different steps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? <p> This is an answer that only you can give . However , here are some things to consider : <p> subox title= " Choose Weebly If " boxcolor= " #2477ce " - You do not want to " learn " how to build a site , you just want something that is super simple . <p> You need your site to be online ASAP . <p> You plan on having other non-techy staff making updates to the site . <p> You have a relatively simple plan for your business online not some really complicated , customized functionality need. /subox <p> On the other hand <p> subox title= " Choose WordPress If " boxcolor= " #2477ce " - You do have something more complicated/custom in mind virtually everyone you hire to do the work will be familiar with WordPress <p> You are doing a site that will be monetized with Adsense . Plugins make this much easier to manage <p> You plan to hire someone to manage the site odds are that theyve used WordPress <p> You need more themes themes to choose from or your do n't  like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ torn , my suggestion is pretty simple <p> Start building a Weebly site for free and play around with it for an hour or so to see what you come up with . You might be surprised how good it looks and want to stick with it . <p> If you do n't  like the site , or you are hitting limitations that hinder your business switch to WordPress . <p> Weebly can be up and running within minutes , where as WordPress is a little more involved because you need to have a hosting account and domain before you can install WordPress and really start working on it . <h> 2 Comments <p> Ok Ive been looking at all your posts about weebly . Ive plugged tons of weebly sites into alexa and ONLY ONE has a ranking under 1 million ! And the one was your ballparksavvy site which is 5 years old if I remember you correctly and its 983,000,000 ! <p> Why are you guys steering people to a platform that REALLY inhibits the reach of their business ?

My site is having its best year yet 35K visits in last 30 days , 30K organic . The point is n't that Weebly caused those results , but its proof that those results are possible using Weebly of that 's the site builder you choose .

@@21641550 @1641550/ <h> What Is The Best Website Builder For Small Business ? <p> Recently on the Long Tail Pro blog we wrote about the most viable alternatives to WordPress for small business . Since then , we 've been diving deeper into some of these different website builders to show- the pros and cons of each . <p> Before we get started , we just wanted to say that while there are pros and cons to each platform , ultimately what matters is how you take full advantage of the platform you 've chosen do n't  get analysis paralysis and take ages picking between the different options laid out here . Take a glance , choose , then move on and start building your business . <p> Today were going to answer the question " What is the best website builder for small business ? " <p> The answer , of course , is that it depends . <p> There are tons of variables involved here , so declaring a " winner " as the best website builder for all small businesses would be foolish . That said , were going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the website management tool that may be right for you . <h> Laying The Groundwork <p> I mentioned all the different variables involved in this conversation , and here are a few situations that come to mind : <p> 1 . You have a really small business with just a couple of employees , and none of you have any time or experience in building a website . At the same time , - you do n't  have the budget to hire someone to build it for you . <p> 2 . Your small business wants to sell your own products online , and you need a website builder with an e-commerce solution . <p> 3 . You have a small business but plan to pay a designer for a custom website solution you do n't  want to mess with it . <p> 4 . You need something that a few different staff members can update on their own , and none of them are experienced in website management . <p> The list could go on and on , but maybe one of these sound like your situation . I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I Want/Need To Build My Own Small Business Website <p> If you plan to go with a DIY website solution for your small business , it could be because you just want to have full control or it could be because you do n't  have the budget to hire someone to do it for you . <p> All 3 are very simple to use , meaning that you do n't  need to have any technical knowledge to create a website that looks professional and modern . <p> In addition to that , all 3 of these have built-in e-commerce solutions for your business . This means that if you do need to sell products on your website , you can do so . This is also very simple to set up in each of these systems . <p> If e-commerce is the primary focus of your business website , then you might want to take a look at Shopify or Bigcommerce . These are online shopping cart solutions that have more robust functionality for e-commerce business , although their website editing tool is n't quite as intuitive as the 3 mentioned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , maybe you are a local plumbing business , then Id- take a good look at Weebly for a simple website builder . While I 've tried out many different website builders personally , I 've found Weebly to be as user-friendly as any of them and I always recommend it to " non-techie " friends who want a DIY website solution . <p> Here are a few- reasons that it makes sense : - <p> 1 . You start with picking a " theme " which is the design of your website . You have different color choices to go with , and you can then customize your fonts , logo , and text to fit the theme . There are a couple dozen themes that look very professional and modern , so unless you have a really particular design in mind , you 'll most certainly find something you like . <p> 2 . The editor is " drag and drop " meaning you take an element like a title , block of text , or an image and simply drop it into the page where you want it . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beginner , and makes it possible for other staff members to feel comfortable making changes to your website if needed . <p> 3 . You can still " do SEO . " While search engine optimization sounds very complicated , I do n't  think it has to be . For you , Id- think about it like the 80/20 rule . If you do a few simple things right , that is 80% of the battle . Sure there can be more to it , and an SEO agency would probably say that I 'm oversimplifying it , but if you are a small business who is short on budget and doing your own website , check out my guide to Weebly SEO- and feel confident that you are in a solid position for the search engines ( like Google . ) <p> 4 . Its quick to do . You may be dreading doing a website because you picture yourself sitting in a dark office at 3 AM reading through an HTML for dummies manual trying to figure out how to make something BOLD. - <p> While you still have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the actual design and creation of a Weebly website can be done in a day without prior experience . Most of the time will be spent typing out your content , assuming you do n't  have it written already . <p> If your primary concern is having a presence online , then having a 5 10 page site that looks great and has all the SEO basics covered can be done in short order . <p> 5 . It is affordable . You 'll find that most of the " drag and drop " style website builders have fairly similar pricing options. - Having a small , non e-commerce site as described above would be about $8 per month on Squarespace or Weebly , and maybe $12 or so on Wix . <p> You can start for free on all 3 of these site builders , so you really know what you are getting into before you ever spend a dime . <p> Either way , the upfront costs are relatively low which is probably why you are looking for a DIY solution in the first place . <h> I Plan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small business has the budget to hire a professional web designer to create your website , that 's a huge benefit ! If you have n't already , do some research on the kinds of questions you should be asking before hiring a web designer . <p> If you hire a web designer , they may- have their own content management system- in mind . You could- find a website builder or content management system that you like and find a designer that specializes in that system first . For instance , you can find people who specialize in building sites for Squarespace , Wix , and other user-friendly website builders if that is what you prefer . <p> One of the biggest concerns you should have is how the site gets updated after the initial design and creation of it . <p> In other words , you want to make sure that the content management system they use is something that you know how to work with on a basic level . If not , you 'll likely pay for some ongoing support that you may not anticipate upfront or have the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nice to be able to change " There " to " Their " on my- home page without having to put in a support ticket or make a phone call to someone else . So its very important to see and understand how your content will be managed after they create your site . As William Beachy of GoMedia put it in his HuffPo article , " Being able to quickly and intuitively edit your website is critical to the long term value of your website . " <p> So if you 'd like to get a professional to design the site but do the basic maintenance and content publishing on your own thereafter , you should strongly consider WordPress . It is easily the most widely used CMS today , and is very easy to use once you get familiar with the layout of the admin side of things . <p> Admin Side of WordPress CMS <p> Since about 75 million sites depend on WordPress , you 'll also find that there are a plethora of designers ( and other custom providers you may need to hire in the future ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to that , WordPress has a marketplace with over 37,000 plugins which can add more features and functionality to your site . These could be plugins for adding social sharing buttons , eliminating SPAM comments , improving your contact form , and even adding e-commerce capabilities . <p> Because its so widely used , there are just a ton of WordPress add-ons available to you when you need them . <p> So if you 're going to hire someone , consider finding a designer that will set you up on the WordPress content management system and then you can take a little bit of time to get familiar with the system so you can start blogging and adding other pages to your site . Even if you plan to hire- someone to do the regular management and updates on your site , using WordPress is a safe bet because it is so ubiquitous . If they 've got- any experience at all , managing something on WordPress should be no problem . <h> The Ultimate Decision <p> In the end , I think this conversation starts out with whether or not you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else to do it . here 's an article which sheds a little more light on both sides of that decision , including some of the things I mentioned like maintenance and your business type . <p> So let 's assume that you 've decided to create your own small business website . <p> Ask yourself , what do most customers want from your website in the first place ? And can I deliver that by doing it myself ? <p> I- doubt they 've won any design awards for their creative web experience but it gets the job done for most of their customers . You can quickly see what they do , view their menu , find a location , and know where else to buy their stuff . <p> I would guess that this regional restaurant hired a custom web design company to build this , which is completely fine . I 'm not against hiring web designers in any way . <p> My only point is that if you are a local restaurant who does n't  have the money for hiring a designer right now , you could build something- that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ customers what they want by using a DIY solution like Weebly- or Squarespace. - ( READ MORE : - See my comparison of Weebly and Squarespace here . ) <p> As in many things , I believe many of us get bogged down trying to create the " perfect " website and we end up wasting a whole bunch of time , or worse end up with no website at all . <p> So what are you waiting for ? <p> If you 're thinking about tackling this on your own , start for free and see what you come up with . Maybe it will be easier than you think .

Producing Engaging Content <p> 2 . Producing Content Consistently <p> 3 . Producing a Variety of Content <p> Whether you are a business trying to find and engage customers , or someone who builds niche/authority websites as a side gig the struggle of consistently creating high quality content that will attract readers and keep your existing readers interested is very real . The great thing about producing high quality content is that its a strategy that works on any site , any platform ( e.g Squarespace , Weebly , WordPress ) , and any niche . Its a lot of work , but it also just plain works . <p> Take a look at their infographic and afterwards , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ produce quick , engaging content on your blog or website . <p> There is a ton to take in on this infographic , so let 's focus on the challenges mentioned earlier . I 'm going to highlight 10- quick blog post ideas that can be implemented in a variety of niches and industries : <h> 1 . Embed and React . <p> This term comes from the folks at Digital Marketer- who have a number of excellent content ideas that are quick and effective. - The post you are reading right now is actually an " embed and react " post . <p> The idea is that you take a Youtube video , Infographic , Slideshare , or some other form of visual media that people want to be shared across the internet and embed it into a blog post . Then , you simply " react " in some way in that same blog post . <p> In this case , I found a really in-depth infographic and noticed that creating a variety of helpful content on a consistent basis is a big struggle for people , so I 'm reacting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a short amount of time . <p> The uses for this are nearly endless . <p> If you are in a plumbing business , you could share a Youtube video of some DIY plumber teaching people how to fix a leak . Then , below the video you can react by pointing out what he did right and what he did wrong . <p> If you run an environmental website , you could embed an infographic with stats about pollution or other problems and then offer your practical advice for how people can help reverse these trends . <p> By embedding really interesting visuals that someone else created and adding in your own insight , you can save time and budget and still give your readers top notch content . <h> 2 . FAQ <p> Frequently asked questions are n't  some blazing trend , but they can often be turned into a helpful and fast blog post . <p> If you sell a product or service , simply jot down all the questions you receive . Then , when you are short on blog content , use one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If someone is asking you , then a bunch of others are probably wondering the same thing . <p> If you ca n't turn one question/answer into a full blog post , then do a " mail bag " or a compilation where you answer a few different questions in one post . <h> 3 . Create a Series <p> If you are teaching people about a topic or how to do something specific , think about breaking it up into a series of steps . It can be easier to take in from the readers perspective and it let 's you turn one piece of content into a series of 4 or 5 . This allows you to go in-depth on each step of the process , and it gives you a reason to email or communicate with your audience as you- publish the series . <p> Jennifer Snyder recently talked about the value of using series on your blog by saying " The benefits of series posts are twofold . You have the opportunity to teach your readers and keep them coming back for more every week . Also , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the series , which is good for search engine optimization. " <h> 4 . Aggregating Content <p> Aggregation is simply compiling and curating a bunch of different ideas into one big list , and using it on your blog . <p> You see these everywhere because they work well and they are relatively quick to produce . <p> Here is an example from DIYReady : <p> They created a post of 14 detox waters , - which at the time of this writing has been shared over 73,000 times on Pinterest . <p> The crazy part ? <p> All 14 detox water recipes were created and posted on other sites . DIY Ready simply found the recipes they liked best , put them all into one blog post and linked back to the original source of the recipe : <p> The last point is an important one . Aggregation is n't about stealing other peoples stuff and acting like its yours . When you collect a bunch of ideas that your audience will benefit from , be sure that you are linking back to the source and give credit where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Old Post <p> If you 've been blogging for awhile , then youve probably had some hits and some misses . Those posts that really resonate with your readers , maybe get a bunch of comments and shares , and then those posts which simply do not . <p> She mentions looking for comments like these on your original blog post as a sign that you could write more on that topic : <p> I do n't understand . <p> I disagree , and here 's why . <p> I do n't think this would work for me . <p> Here 's my specific situation . Would this work for me ? <p> This is so helpful . I especially like the part about . <p> These are all signs that you could dive deeper into one part of that topic , apply the concept to different situations , overcome objections to your original point , etc . <p> Its something your audience wants to hear and because you 've written about it in the past , and you 'll probably be able to churn out another post in short order . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 6 . Best Practices/Knowledge Sharing <p> Our business is software . Originally , Long Tail Pro was created by Spencer Haws because he was n't a big fan of the keyword research tools available in the market . Were a small team , but we do n't  just sell and promote software we still use Long Tail Pro- for our own projects . <p> Because of that , we 've discovered and learned things about how to get the most out of the software . The problem is , its easy to forget that new customers do n't  inherently know the things you 've learned with experience . So recently , we created a post with 5 tips for getting the most out of Long Tail Platinum in an attempt to share some advice that will make keyword research faster and more effective . <p> Could you do something like this for your own business ? <p> Another example is the website builder Weebly , who does a " Howd They Do That " video series on their Youtube Channel. - In it , they show cool things their users have done and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with your website . ( By the way , if you 're wondering if what platform to use for your site , we have comparison posts on Wix vs Weebly , Weebly vs Squarespace , and Weebly vs WordPress ) . <p> This kind of content is something your existing customers can really benefit from . <h> 7 . Interview Posts <p> Interviews do n't  always have to be a formal thing , and they do n't  have to be an audio recording . <p> In fact , if you email a busy person and ask to " interview " them for your blog , it may be a tough sell unless you have a personal relationship or a decent sized audience already . <p> The good news is , that does n't  need to stop you from doing interview posts on your blog . This is another template used by the folks at Digital Marketer that I 'm a big fan of . One example they share is on the Salesforce blog , about how 10 winning sales people spend the 15 minutes before a sales call . <p> To create @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get comfortable with email outreach . <p> Think of a question that your readers would love to know the answer to , then ask influencers or experts on that topic what they think . <p> For instance : <p> " How 17 Wedding Planners Make Memories on a Budget . " <p> For a post like this , simply email a bunch of professional wedding planners and ask something like : <p> Hi Name , <p> I 'm working on an expert round-up of wedding planners and would love to include you. - Hopefully its an opportunity to brag a little bit about your work = <p> Whats- the most creative thing you 've done for a wedding party that was on a very tight budget ? - <p> Thanks in advance and I 'll be sure to send you a link once we publish ! - <p> Jake <p> As the answers start rolling in , start compiling your list of insights . Again , you 'll have excellent content that was largely written for you by experts in the industry who volunteered to share their knowledge . <h> 8 . Cover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ type in a keyword that fits your business and then filter down to a recent time range like the past 7 days or past 30 days . Let 's assume my blog was full of ideas for homemade crafts . I might get super creative and type in " crafts . " <p> Then , scroll down and click on " Rising " to see the things that have been growing in popularity during that time span : <p> Assuming you are heavily involved in your industry , you might not be surprised to see some of the items that are rising in popularity on Google . In fact , youve probably got an opinion or insight to share on the topic . <p> That could make for a simple and timely blog post . <p> In this example , people are searching for " save on crafts " a lot recently . <p> This could quickly be turned into an aggregation post that we discussed earlier , or if saving money on crafts is something you 've covered in the past , maybe you compile some of your own best ideas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big list of ideas for your readers . <h> 9 . Convert Existing Content Into Visuals <p> Everyone learns and consumes information differently . Things you 've written in the past may be better served to some people as a visual . We talked earlier about " embed and react " where you use the visuals someone else has created , but you can also create your own visuals pretty quickly as a way to better connect with your audience . <p> Canva is now my go to tool for creating attractive images and graphics . <p> Recently , theyve added templates for infographics and blog graphics which allow you to put your ideas into really attractive visuals . Many of the templates and elements are free to use , so it is n't a stretch to say that you could convert a previously published list of ideas , a " how to " post , etc. into your own custom graphic without spending any money . <p> No , you probably wo n't win a design award for your work on Canva , but you 'll have something beautiful and professional that speaks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) <p> Besides the visual itself , you can add some written copy to really drive home the point . <p> Repurposing as a visual will give you more variety in your content without spending weeks coming up with the information . <h> 10 . Inviting Others to Guest Post <p> Guest posting has been around forever , but have you ever hosted a guest poster on your website ? <p> Its a fantastic way to get new content on your site that you do n't  have to spend any time creating. - In our industry of internet marketing , people guest post like crazy . But if you have a blog about hot tub maintenance and care , there probably are n't  a bunch of people in that industry seeking out solid guest contributors . <p> If that 's the case in your industry , you should be at an advantage . <p> Find people that you admire , thought leaders , and others in your space and ask them if theyd like to post on your blog . This- is really a mutually beneficial arrangement when done right . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exposure to your audience and the chance to further establish themselves as an expert in the industry . <p> Heres- one way that you can approach someone about contributing to your site : <p> Hi Name , <p> I hope all is well ! This is Jake from , a local pool and spa company in Cincinnati , OH. - <p> I 'm a big fan of your blog . In fact , your company is part of the reason we started a blog on our own site to connect with customers so thank you ! - <p> Your certainly an expert in our- industry , and we 'd love to have you share some of your insight with our audience . Please let me know what you think and well figure out the details . <p> Thanks , Jake <p> Clearly you do n't  have to follow this exact template . <p> However , I 've had the most success when I do a little bit of " ego bait " by mentioning my admiration for their work . In fact , if you can briefly comment on something specific that their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simply say that you 'd be honored to host them on your site and let them share with your audience . <p> Keep it short , and try to get an initial response . If they respond positively , then you can work out some specific topic ideas or ask them if there is something specific theyd like to share . <h> Wrap Up <p> Keeping up with a blog is tough especially when that is only part of your job ! Hopefully these ideas have given you some inspiration of things you can create in a short amount of time that will add variety and provide value to your audience . <p> Do you have blog post ideas that have worked well ?

During the beta period all the upgraded features that are new to the platinum version are free to use . <p> We have been working on these upgraded features for several months and so we want your feedback ! But first , in order to get a grasp of what 's new in this version , please watch the video below : <p> flowplayer id= " 3758 ? <p> ( Expand video to Full-Screen using controls in bottom right hand corner ) <p> In addition , in order to calculate keyword competitiveness , you will be required to input a free SEOmoz API key . The first time you try to run a competitor analysis , you will be promted with instructions on how to get your SEOmoz key for free . <h> Keyword Competitiveness <p> The crowning feature of the Platinum version is the keyword competitiveness calculation. - In a nutshell , this is a number between 0 and 100 that tells you how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Google . <p> Our proprietary formula takes the data provided by SEOmoz , and in particular the " Page Authority " and adjusts that calculation based on how closely the actual URL and Title results match the specific keyword . <p> In other words , the Avg . Keyword Competitiveness tells you how authoritative the results are AND how well they actually target your chosen keyword. - As we all know , if a result is not really targeting your specific keyword , its not a real strong result EVEN if its an overall authoritative page. - The key to strength in Google is having an authoritative page ( page links , domain authority , page authority , etc ) that ALSO targets specific keywords ( within the title is best ) . <p> This highly complex keyword competitiveness formula takes a look at all the results and gives you quickly a number between 0 and 100 for how competitive the results are based on authority and keyword relevancy . <p> Everyone targets different types of keywords. - Some go after only extremely low competition keywords , others target @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keywords. - So , you will have to determine what type of " Avg . KC " you are willing to look at. - However , as a general guideline ; here is what I have found from my own analysis for keyword competitiveness : <p> 0 to 10 No competition <p> 10 to 20 Extremely low competition <p> 20 to 30 Low competition <p> 30 to 40 Moderate Competition <p> 40 to 50 Somewhat High Competition <p> 50 to 60 Very High Competition <p> 60 to 70 Extremely High Competition <p> 70 to 100 Do n't  even think about it ! <p> Overall , please dive into the software and enjoy the upgraded features for free during the beta period ! - If you notice any changes that need to be made to the beta version , please submit a support ticket right here . <p> Thanks for testing out Long Tail Platinum ! <h> 37 Comments <p> Could you also include a metric that would check to see how many " index pages " are in each top ten ? Just like what they have in the free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important metric that most if not all tools leave out , this really further helps to determine if that particular keyword is worth going after . <p> very easy and so much easier to manage things . Love the favorites , so much better than having to keep a long list down the side of all of my project keywords . The Bing thing is really good , although I never seem to be able to rank above +500 on Bing , yet I am on page 1 in Google and page 2 in Yahoo. maybe there 's a post or a podcast in there somewhere because Bing just does not work for my Niche sites . <p> I did have a bit of trouble with SEOMOZ , I was getting a pop up asking me to sign into something and asking me to go to a page ( lsapi.seomoz.com ) Once I shut down my Firefox browser it worked . <p> For example : i used to rank for this keyword " avg for mac " with an 1 page EMD domain in just 2 weeks even after emd update @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but your KC for this term is : 36 " Moderate Competition <p> I missed the first 3/4 of the webinar : ( , I would be interested in using the AVG KC in a bulk form , i.e. import hundreds to thousands of keywords and with the use of proxies determine the AVG KC per keyword . <p> Has something like this been discussed for LTPB , or as the use of proxies can been seen as " spammy " related is this something you 're steering clear of ? <p> No , you should n't wait . Because if you buy today , you get free access to the Platinum version for the next couple of weeks . If you decide to never updgrade to the Platinum version , you will ALWAYS have access to the standard version of Long Tail Pro that is available now . It will continue to be updated and maintained and is still a great option for many people . If you decide to upgrade to the Platinum , it will be cheaper to do so for existing Long Tail Pro users . So , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> One feature that I think you should include in a new version is some filtering options of the keywords generated . Like the google adwords tools has . Include a specific word ( full match or anywhere ) or exclude a word . The lists can get long and filtering can make it easier to go through them . <p> This is really a great update to the already great product . I have not signed up for SEOMOZ yet but have thought about it for the past few months . Now that I see you are using it and even building it into the updates , I will be purchasing . <p> Chris again . Yes my vote is for a " one time payment " option . Looking to pay one time and that 's it , do n't  like the idea of paying a monthly fee , since there are similar tools that provide you with SEOMoz metrics for FREE . If you decide to go this route , what price point would you price it at ? <p> Rick Long tail Pro will always only be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be an additional cost . If you do n't  wan the platinum features that 's fine , you 'll always have access to all the great features of the standard version . Were not adding a checker for indexed pages at this point , but I 'll consider for the future . <p> I 've played around with LTP platinum now for a few days &amp; wanted to leave some feedback . Positives : I think the keyword research workflow and new features have been really well thought out . The workflow is very streamlined and gets the data back from google and SEOMoz very fast . Features wise I think LTP Platinum is well ahead of the competition and I making that comparison having purchased/ subscribed to half a dozen different key word research tools . Ok here 's the negatives : general app performance on the mac is not good , sorting columns and scrolling through datasets with hundreds of results is painful . Switching between projects or making changes to project settings just seems to crap out LTP and I would say the project " management " features are no way near @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of projects . Overall i think its an awesome update which I would use almost exclusively as my go to research tool if it was n't for the performance problems . <p> i 'm thinking about buying LTP platinum but i cant find any information about how long " the contract " is . Can i end my subscription at the end of each month ? what i would liketo do is Use LTP " normaly " without subscription ( platinum ) , but maybe now and then take a month subscription to do my keyword research that month . is that possible ? <p> Hi , I am starting to use Longtail Pro for some work I am doing and really like it . Is there any way to get to test drive the Longtail Platinum version prior to committing to a monthly charge ? Also , for those of us who are not dedicated internet marketers can we purchase a block of service for a period of time . Example one month is $xx.

@@21641560 @1641560/ <h> Long Tail Keywords In The Real World 5 Practical Examples From The Front Lines <p> Obviously long tail keywords are at the very core of the Long Tail Pro software , but there is a reason for that <p> They work . <p> Finding and ranking for low competition keywords has been an instrumental part of- our own businesses and personal websites for a number of years . <p> Let me show you a recent example : <p> Here is a screenshot of the organic ( search engine ) traffic for a site Ive been doing in my free time . This is just- showing the growth from July to today ( The low day- in August was a tracking error ) : <h> Your Execution Strategy <p> I 'll assume that we all agree that finding the low competition , long tail keywords in your industry is a smart idea . <p> Now the question becomes , how do you execute this strategy ? - <p> The truth is that it takes some creativity and hard work . <p> For instance , looking for inspiration and ideas during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that are n't  so obvious . A while back I went through this exercise using forums and the Amazon Kindle Store to find some keyword ideas in the healthy eating space . Click here to see that post . <p> Once you 've found an idea , its important to create excellent content . <p> There are never any guarantees with Google , but creating something of true value that targets the keyword and delights visitors is going to give you the best opportunity to rank well in the search engines . <p> Basically you look for services , tools , products , etc. that your readers might use and compare them . Its not exactly a groundbreaking idea , but you might be surprised just how many " versus " style post opportunities there are in your niche . <p> In Nectafys case , they- focused on the keyword " hubspot vs. google analytics " since many of their clients use those tools , and might be interested in learning more about the similarities and differences between them . <p> Currently , they rank #1 for this keyword with this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> This is a perfect example of the fact- that when you focus on low competition keywords , you have the ability to rank well much- faster . You can often find keywords like this at the very low end of search volume in Long Tail Pro ( e.g 10 monthly searches ) . You can also use tools like Ubersuggest to find these types of comparison keywords . <p> If theyd written a general overview of Google Analytics , I have my doubts that theyd be #1 for the search term " Google Analytics " anytime soon <p> Although the target keyword gets searched less than 100 times per month on average , Henry reports that " We- posted it 4 months ago and were on pace for 3,000 visits and 30 leads in- the first year . That 's not a massive win , but if each blog post performed- this well every single company in the world would say it makes sense to- write . " <p> Henry makes a brilliant point that should n't be overlooked . <p> Long tail keywords are n't  a one and done strategy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ranking #1 for " hubspot vs. google analytics. " - However , by finding dozens of these keywords and repeating the process , suddenly they have a lead generation machine that is very inexpensive to run . <p> The final thing to highlight from this example is that traffic alone is n't the goal . <p> Its ultimately about leads and sales . <p> Nectafy has several calls to action like a free ebook and a free guide to inbound marketing that serve as a way for them to capture leads : <p> Make sure you prepare for this in advance by thinking about a content upgrade or call to action to accompany your content . If not , you 'll likely see a lot of nice traffic statistics without the increased leads that should accompany them . <h> 2 . Make A Celebrity Connection <p> Do n't  worry I 'm not saying you have to actually make a personal connection to a celebrity in order to make this tactic work . <p> What I am saying is that people gravitate towards celebrities and often want to be like them in one way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ post about our long tail YouTube marketing strategy , I talked about a successful YouTube channel called ILoveBasketballTV . Many of their videos teach people how to do things like the best players in the NBA . <p> If you search YouTube for " How to shoot a basketball like Stephen Curry " you 'll find that they rank at the top , and have over 1,000,000 views on their tutorial of how to emulate Currys jump shot . <p> There is power in a celebrity connection . <p> Nitish Kumar of WiseCalvin.com tapped into this concept with his fitness website . <p> He recognized that trying to rank well for competitive searches in the fitness market was going to be darn near impossible for a new fitness website . So Nitish started thinking long tail . <p> Perhaps the most famous soccer player in the world is Cristiano Ronaldo . He s famous for both his skills on the field and his physique . <p> There are plenty of guys whod love to have a body like Rondaldo , so what do you think they are searching Google for ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what he eats , and other secrets to his success . So Nitish built this resource- that shares this information . <p> He now ranks well for phrases like " get fit like Cristiano Ronaldo " and " Cristiano Ronaldo workout . " <p> By starting with long tail keywords , WorkoutTrends.com has now started to also rank for more competitive keywords taking their organic traffic to the next level . Here is a look at their traffic numbers for the last couple of weeks : <p> In addition to the traffic , theyve also seen a spike in opt-ins ( leads ) and their sale of affiliate products . <p> Are there any celebrities or thought leaders in your industry that you could piggy back off of to bring in free traffic ? <h> 3 . Master Local Real Estate <p> Ivan Ciraj is a Realtor in Ontario , Canada and runs the site SquareOneLife.com. - Real estate is a highly competitive space both with local brokerages and huge sites like Zillow and Trulia also- vying for that traffic . <p> Ivan specializes in buying and selling condos in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his content on specific condos , new developments , specific lofts and addresses , and other popular buildings in the area . <p> Ivan described his reasoning for this strategy this way : " I knew this because condo building addresses and- names were very specific and not competitive , but if they ranked high , the- visitors would be highly filtered and therefore easily convertible into- leads and thus sales . " <p> Its a fantastic point and yet another benefit of focusing on long tail keywords . <p> Often , you are pulling in visitors who are much closer to making a purchase , and have a real buyer intent . <p> Ivan has a blog , but he also does reviews of different condo complexes . The page for each complex is actually full of images , statistics , and listings inside of that building - not just some thin content you 'd skip past . <p> The result is that if you were interested in the Chelsea Towers in- Mississauga and " Googled " it , you 'll find SquareOneLife.com near the top : <p> There are many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ near the top for all kinds of condo-specific phrases . <p> Because of these high rankings , Ivan gets 5 10 new real estate leads per day- from organic traffic alone . As stated earlier , many of these- turn out to be very high quality . In addition , a real estate lead that turns into a sale- can be worth 5 figures , easily . <h> 4. - A Rural Goldmine <p> Andrew Akesson of Venn Digital in the UK shared a story of a client who made a splash by focusing on the often-overlooked rural areas they served . Many of these small communities werent mentioned on their competitors websites , which left the door wide open for them to include these rural areas and score some easy traffic . <p> The company Andrew worked with is actually a supplier of residential heating oil , - and at the time they had very little brand awareness in the area . <p> Without a huge budget to pour into paid advertising , they turned to a long tail keyword strategy that did n't  cost much at all . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> 1 . They- made an update to their " coverage " page and included every town and area that they serve . <p> Let 's use my hometown of Cincinnati , OH as an example to illustrate the concept. - On my page of the areas I serve , rather than simply saying " Greater Cincinnati and Northern Kentucky " I 'd list out all the different suburbs and areas that would fall under that umbrella like Mason , Anderson , Fort Thomas , etc . <p> 2 . Next they linked every area in the list to a page specifically focused on that place . In my Cincinnati example , I 'd have a page optimized for- " Mason Heating Oil " that has both general , and area specific information . <p> 3 . Since their larger competitors had n't  really created content that mentioned the rural areas they served , they were able to rank #1 for a number of different terms like " AREA heating oil " because the competition was so low . <p> The results were spectacular ! <p> Although they took this approach in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first winter . Once they saw the strategy was working , they doubled down with more location-specific landing pages for 2014 . <p> Here is a look at the traffic to location-specific landing pages for the winter of 2013 and 2014 : <p> The winter of 2014 saw a 50% bump in traffic , and overall the new sales generated from these location pages alone generated an ROI of 1644%. - <h> 5 . The Service Consolidation <p> While- our last example found success by creating a bunch of new pages for the areas they served , these guys had better luck through consolidation . <p> Jason Parks , owner of the Media Captain in Columbus , OH- decided that it made the most sense to categorize and consolidate all the different services they offer . Rather than having 40+ individual service pages , they created larger categories like Online Advertising- which has allowed them to rank very well locally for searches like- " Online Advertising Company in Columbus . " <p> Jason went on to say " If you take it one step further though , there are niche @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you conduct a search for- " display remarketing advertising company in Columbus " we also rank well for- this longer tail keyword . <p> Instead of having a lot of different pages for the 40+ services that we can- offer , we consolidated it into fewer pages trying to give more authority to- each page . We have grouped different niches , like PPC advertising , display , - video advertising , all within the online advertising umbrella . " <p> There are certainly plenty of cases where long tail keyword consolidation makes sense . If bringing a bunch of related keywords under one " umbrella " makes for a better user experience , then you should absolutely do it . <p> Most of the time , longer content performs better in the search engines anyway . Serpiq put together some data a couple years back showing how many words of content were in the top 10 search results on average . Check out the graph : <p> So maybe you 've found a few related keywords with a small amount of search volume , perhaps creating the " ultimate guide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subsections would be the way to go . <p> Another example of this is the post on Survival Life with 36 different paracord projects. - This post ranks for hundreds of long tail , paracord-related keywords . It naturally gets links and social shares because of the value it provides to the reader , which contributes to its organic traffic success . <p> In this case , consolidating into 1 list of 36 ideas is much better than having 36 different posts with 1 idea each . <h> Wrap up <p> Hopefully this list gets your wheels spinning a little bit . Here is a quick summary of questions to ask yourself in order to find better long tail keyword opportunities : <p> What are the things in your space that your target audience would love to see an in-depth comparison on ? <p> Which celebrities can you use to share your expertise ? How to be funny- like , How to- get abs- like , How to sell like . <p> Can you provide better , more specific content on things your competitors are not ? <p> Do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , how can you add that information and improve both the user experience and your local search presence ? <p> Which pages can you consolidate into 1 " hub . " These could be your services like The Media Captain , or it could be combining shorter blog post ideas into one large guide . <p> Best of luck ! <p> - <h> 3 Comments <p> Thanks for including me , Jake ! This is a super informative article . I think I took away one important concept from numbers 2 5 . Typically , short phrases or concepts are hard to rank for . But names of people , names of towns , names of other companies are typically not nearly as competitive . So if you can do it right without offending/infringing on the celebrity or company you write about , you 're much more likely to rank . <p> Thank you for the awesome article , it is very informative .
