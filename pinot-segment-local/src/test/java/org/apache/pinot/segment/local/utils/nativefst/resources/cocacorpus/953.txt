@@11574352 @174352/ <p> To most people , crystals mean diamond bling , semiprecious gems or perhaps the jagged amethyst or quartz crystals beloved by collectors . <p> To Norman Yao , these inert crystals are the tip of the iceberg . <p> If crystals have an atomic structure that repeats in space , like the carbon lattice of a diamond , why cant crystals also have a structure that repeats in time ? That is , a time crystal ? <p> In a paper published online last week in the journal Physical Review Letters , the UC Berkeley assistant professor of physics describes exactly how to make and measure the properties of such a crystal , and even predicts what the various phases surrounding the time crystal should be " akin to the liquid and gas phases of ice . <p> A one-dimensional chain of ytterbium ions was turned into a time crystal by physicists at the University of Maryland , based on a blueprint provided by UC Berkeleys Norman Yao . Each ion behaves like an electron spin and exhibits long-range interactions indicated as arrows . ( Image courtesy of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Two groups followed Yaos blueprint and have already created the first-ever time crystals . The groups at the University of Maryland and Harvard University reported their successes , using two totally different setups , in papers posted online last year , and have submitted the results for publication . Yao is a co-author on both papers . <p> Time crystals repeat in time because they are kicked periodically , sort of like tapping Jell-O repeatedly to get it to jiggle , Yao said . The big breakthrough , he argues , is less that these particular crystals repeat in time than that they are the first of a large class of new materials that are intrinsically out of equilibrium , unable to settle down to the motionless equilibrium of , for example , a diamond or ruby . <p> " This is a new phase of matter , period , but it is also really cool because it is one of the first examples of non-equilibrium matter , " Yao said . " For the last half-century , we have been exploring equilibrium matter , like metals and insulators . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ landscape of non-equilibrium matter . " <p> While Yao is hard put to imagine a use for a time crystal , other proposed phases of non-equilibrium matter theoretically hold promise as nearly perfect memories and may be useful in quantum computers . <p> An ytterbium chain <p> The time crystal created by Chris Monroe and his colleagues at the University of Maryland employs a conga line of 10 ytterbium ions whose electron spins interact , similar to the qubit systems being tested as quantum computers . To keep the ions out of equilibrium , the researchers alternately hit them with one laser to create an effective magnetic field and a second laser to partially flip the spins of the atoms , repeating the sequence many times . Because the spins interacted , the atoms settled into a stable , repetitive pattern of spin flipping that defines a crystal . <p> This phase diagram shows how changing the experimental parameters can melt a time crystal into a normal insulator or heat up a time crystal to a high temperature thermal state . Norman Yao graphic . <p> Time crystals were first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last year theoretical physicists at Princeton University and UC Santa Barbaras Station Q independently proved that such a crystal could be made . According to Yao , the UC Berkeley group was " the bridge between the theoretical idea and the experimental implementation . " <p> From the perspective of quantum mechanics , electrons can form crystals that do not match the underlying spatial translation symmetry of the orderly , three-dimensional array of atoms , Yao said . This breaks the symmetry of the material and leads to unique and stable properties we define as a crystal . <p> A time crystal breaks time symmetry . In this particular case , the magnetic field and laser periodically driving the ytterbium atoms produce a repetition in the system at twice the period of the drivers , something that would not occur in a normal system . <p> " Wouldnt it be super weird if you jiggled the Jell-O and found that somehow it responded at a different period ? " Yao said . " But that is the essence of the time crystal . You have some periodic driver that has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that you observe the system oscillating with a period that is larger than T. " <p> Yao worked closely with Monroe as his Maryland team made the new material , helping them focus on the important properties to measure to confirm that the material was in fact a stable or rigid time crystal . Yao also described how the time crystal would change phase , like an ice cube melting , under different magnetic fields and laser pulsing . <p> The Harvard team , led by Mikhail Lukin , set up its time crystal using densely packed nitrogen vacancy centers in diamonds . <p> " Such similar results achieved in two wildly disparate systems underscore that time crystals are a broad new phase of matter , not simply a curiosity relegated to small or narrowly specific systems , " wrote Phil Richerme , of Indiana University , in a perspective piece accompanying the paper published in Physical Review Letters .

While there are advantages to pursuing a three-year degree plan such as reducing financial burdens , they are not for everyone and do involve sacrifices ; especially with respect to participating in co-curricular activities , depth of study , - and summer internships , which typically lead to jobs upon graduation . All things considered , please see the tables for three and three and a half year degree options . <h> Student Learning Goals <h> Mission <p> Economics is the study of how people make choices under conditions of scarcity and the results of those choices for society . Limited resources make tradeoffs necessary for consumers , businesses , and nations . Microeconomics studies how consumers make choices in using their time and spending their income and how businesses make choices in producing and selling goods and services . Macroeconomics studies the determination of national income and how it deviates from its potential ( full employment ) over the business cycle . The important outcomes for the national economy are income and how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and how well financial markets and international trade are functioning . Economics is important in studying the impact of government policies , ranging from regulatory activities in individual markets to general measures for stabilizing and steering the economy at large . The effect of alternative economic policies on the welfare of the population is a core concern in economics . Undergraduates should have the following knowledge and skills when they graduate with an economics major from UC Berkeley . The Department of Economics wants their majors to have knowledge of economics principles with the skills to apply this knowledge in the following ways . <h> Learning Goals of the Major <p> Critical Thinking Skills <p> Apply economic analysis to evaluate everyday problems . <p> Apply economic analysis to evaluate specific policy proposals . <p> Compare two or more arguments that have different conclusions to a specific issue or problem . <p> Understand the role of assumptions in arguments . <p> Quantitative Reasoning Skills <p> Understand how to use empirical evidence to evaluate an economic argument . <p> Understand and evaluate current economic events and new economic ideas . <h> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ UC Berkeley Career Center prepares undergraduates , graduate students , and alumni to make informed decisions about their futures by providing comprehensive resources , programs , and counseling on career development , internships , employment , and graduate school. - Whether it be through a resume critique , an alumni networking event , or an interviewing skills workshop , the Career Center is committed to help all students achieve : <p> Career Clarity : providing students the opportunity to identify their career direction . <p> Career Competitiveness : providing students the opportunities to enhance their marketability via real world experiences . <p> Career Connections : - providing students opportunities to engage with alumni and employers . <h> Common Career Paths for Economics Majors <h> Career Destinations Survey <p> Every year the Career Center surveys graduating seniors about their post-graduation plans to better understand the career outcomes of our alumni including : career fields , job titles , specific employers , entry-level salaries , and graduate/professional school destinations .

@@11574473 @174473/ @qwx198595 <h> Neurobiology <p> Neurobiology is the study of the brain and nervous system , which are the cells and tissue that generate sensation , perception , movement , learning , emotion , and many of the functions that make us human . In the past decades , neurobiological research has made tremendous advances in understanding how this complex organ works , and what goes wrong in neurological disease . Neurobiology is intrinsically multi-disciplinary , spanning from molecular biology and gene regulation in neurons , to chemical and electrical signaling in neurons , to information processing by neural circuits and brain regions , to nervous system development and plasticity . Knowledge at each of these levels is merged to generate a mechanistic , molecular-to-systems level understanding of animal and human behavior . Active research areas in neurobiology include : What is the genetic program that makes a neuron ? Can new neurons be created to treat disease ? How do ion channels work that mediate electrical signaling in neurons ? How do synapses work , and how do they store information during learning ? How do networks of neurons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the brain develop , and how is it specialized through evolution to generate species-specific behavior ? Why do neurons die in neurodegenerative disease , and how can they be saved ? <p> Recent research advances within the Division include understanding how voltage-gated ion channels function , development of new optical approaches to monitor and control activity in specific neurons , how taste sensation works in Drosophila , how neural activity is homeostatically controlled via novel gene regulation pathways , how the retina and cerebral cortex processes sensory information , and how sensory use alters synapses to store sensory information in the brain . Overall , 55 faculty at Berkeley ( in MCB and other departments ) conduct neurobiology research , reflecting the diversity and importance of this field within modern biology . <p> The Neurobiology emphasis prepares students for careers in medicine , including in medical specialties involving the nervous system ( neurology , pharmacology , psychiatry , neuropsychiatry , ophthalmology , otolaryngology , optometry ) , in scientific research in neurobiology ( postgraduate study ) , in biotechnology ( including technical and research oriented careers ) , and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . All Neurobiology majors receive essential coursework in molecular and cell biology , as well as rigorous training in specific neurobiology courses .

Tetlock and Mitchell ( 2009 ) claim that there is no evidence that the IAT reliably predicts class-wide discrimination on tangible outcomes in any setting , accuse their colleagues of violating the injunction to separate factual from value judgments , adhering blindly to a statist interventionist ideology , and of conducting a witch-hunt against implicit racists , sexists , and others . These and other charges are specious . Far from making extraordinary claims that require extraordinary evidence , researchers have identi ? ed the existence and consequences of implicit bias through well-established methods based upon principles of cognitive psychology that have been developed in nearly a centurys worth of work . We challenge the blanket skepticism and organizational complacency advocated by Tetlock and Mitchell and summarize 10 recent studies that no manager ( or managerial researcher ) should ignore .

We use both regression analysis controlling for participation and a propensity score matching approach to create a comparison group similar to the FFS participants in observable characteristics . Results are robust across the two approaches as well as with different matching methods . We find that farmers who participate in the program have significantly more knowledge about IPM practices than those in the non-participant comparison group . We also find suggestive evidence that improved knowledge about IPM practices has the potential to significantly improve productivity in potato production .

This allows us to examine geographic and temporal changes in animal populations , species , and communities , and to track those patterns in relation to natural or human-induced changes in the environment ( e.g. , climate change , landscape alteration , etc . ) . <p> Museum specimens form the basis for research on evolution , speciation , and distribution , and also provide an important baseline for studies of conservation and emerging diseases ( e.g. , hantavirus , West Nile Virus ) . Specimens and associated data ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , reproductive and age information , etc. ) also provide basic information on natural and life history traits of animals . <p> In addition to basic research studies , examples of past and present uses of the MVZ collections include : <p> Tracking historical changes in animal populations and communities in Yosemite National Park and elsewhere in California ( " the Grinnell Project " ) <p> Linking the effects of pesticides ( DDT and DDE ) to eggshell thinning in birds , thus causing reproductive failure and population declines in Brown Pelicans , Peregrine Falcons , and other species <p> Illustrating species and their distributions for field guides and other natural history books <p> Using tissue samples collected from rodents in the 1970s to better understand the occurrence and distribution of hantavirus

@@11574587 @174587/ <p> Even as the economy has at last begun to expand at a more rapid pace , growth in wages and benefits for most American workers has continued its decades-long stagnation . Real hourly wages of the median American worker were just 5 percent higher in 2013 than they were in 1979 , while the wages of the bottom decile of earners were 5 percent lower in 2013 than in 1979.1 Trends since the early 2000s are even more pronounced . Inflation-adjusted wage growth from 2003 to 2013 was either flat or negative for the entire bottom 70 percent of the wage distribution.2 Compounding the problem of stagnating wages is the decline in employerprovided health insurance , with the share of non-elderly Americans receiving insurance from an employer falling from 67 percent in 2003 to 58.4 percent in 2013.3 <p> Stagnating wages and decreased benefits are a problem not only for low-wage workers who increasingly can not make ends meet , but also for the federal government as well as the 50 state governments that finance the public assistance programs many of these workers and their families turn to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Americas major public support programs are members of working families ; 4 the taxpayers bear a significant portion of the hidden costs of low-wage work in America . <p> This is the first report to examine the cost to the 50 states of public assistance programs for working families . We examine working families utilization of the health care programs Medicaid and Childrens Health Insurance Program ( CHIP ) , as well as their enrollment in the basic household income assistance program Temporary Aid to Needy Families ( TANF ) . Both of these programs operate with shared funding from the federal government and the states , and in this report we also examine the costs to the federal government of Medicaid/CHIP and TANF , as well as the Earned Income Tax Credit ( EITC ) and the food stamps program ( Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program , or SNAP ) . Our analysis includes only the cash assistance portion of TANF , and it does not include costs for state Earned Income Tax Credits , child care assistance , or other state-funded means-tested programs . Overall , we find that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ per year on these four programs for working families and the states collectively spent $25 billion per year on Medicaid/CHIP and TANF for working families for a total of $152.8 billion per year . In all , more than half " 56 percent " of combined state and federal spending on public assistance goes to working families . <h> DATA <p> We define working families as those that have at least one family member who works 27 or more weeks per year and 10 or more hours per week . To calculate the cost to the federal and state governments of public assistance programs for working families , we mainly rely on two sources of data : the March Supplement of the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics Current Population Survey ( CPS ) from 2010 " 2012 and administrative data from the Medicaid , CHIP , TANF , EITC , and SNAP programs for FY 2009 " 10 . All amounts are adjusted to and reported in 2013 dollars . Medicaid figures exclude aged , blind , and disabled enrollees . Our calculation method is described in the appendix . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ significant changes in Medicaid enrollment since implementation of the Affordable Care Act ( ACA ) , but these change are not reflected in this analysis because the data is not yet available . A key provision of the ACA , adopted by 28 states and Washington D.C. , expanded Medicaid coverage starting in 20145 to low-income adults under age 65 including those without children living at home , with the federal government paying 100 percent of the cost through 2016 . In addition , enrollment in " traditional " Medicaid " that is , among those who had been previously eligible " has also been boosted , in both expansion and nonexpansion states , due to the individual mandate to obtain health insurance , as well as increased outreach , awareness , and system improvements to Medicaid related to the ACA , particularly since the opening of the health care exchanges in October 2013.6 These costs will be shared by the federal government and the states as determined under traditional Medicaid formulas . <h> Low-Wage Occupations and Public Assistance Rates <p> Reliance on public assistance can be found among workers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occupations with particularly high levels of public assistance program utilization that have been recently analyzed are front-line fast food workers , 7 child care providers , 8 and home care workers.9Each of these have at or near 50 percent of their workforce in families with at least one family member relying on a public assistance program . <p> However , high reliance on public assistance programs among workers is n't found only in service occupations . Fully one-quarter of part-time college faculty and their families are enrolled in at least one of the public assistance programs analyzed in this report.10 <h> AGGREGATE-LEVEL FINDINGS <h> Enrollment <p> Table 1 shows the total enrollment as well as working families enrollment in the four major public assistance programs between 2009 and 2011 . Among Medicaid/CHIP recipients , 34.1 million were workers and their dependents ; this comprises well over half ( 61 percent ) of the programs overall enrollment . TANF , the smallest program , had 2.3 million recipients who were workers and their dependents , comprising almost one-third ( 32 percent ) of all program enrollees . The 20.6 million working families @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 74 percent ) of total EITC recipients . The SNAP program had 10.3 million working families receiving assistance , comprising 36 percent of the total program enrollment . There is significant overlap in enrollment in these programs , and we are not able to determine with this data the total number of enrollees in these four programs combined . <h> Expenditures <p> Aggregated Federal Spending <p> Table 2 ( page 4 ) details the expenses at the federal level of the four public assistance programs , and the portions of the program expenditures that went to working families . Overall , between 2009 and 2011 the federal government spent $226.8 billion ( in 2013 dollars ) annually on these programs , with 56 percent " that is , $127.8 billion " going to working families . <p> More than half ( 55 percent ) of the federal Medicaid/ CHIP annual expenditures " $45.4 billion " went to workers and their dependents . Around one-quarter of federal TANF funds ( $1.6 billion annually ) were used to assist working families . Fully four-fifths ( 81 percent ) of yearly EITC costs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ billion for working families , which is 38 percent of total federal expenditures on this program . <p> Aggregated State Spending <p> Overall , states collectively spent $25 billion annually between 2009 and 2011 to fund public assistance health programs and provide cash assistance to working families ( see Table 3 , page 4 ) . This represented over half ( 52 percent ) of total state-level funding for the two programs . <p> As shown in Table 3 , per year the states collectively spent $43.9 billion on the health programs Medicaid and CHIP . Out of this , $23.8 billion " 54 percent " was used to fund these health programs for members of working families . Looking at TANF , $1.2 billion ( 27 percent ) of the $4.6 billion cash assistance provided by the states went to working families . <h> STATE-BY-STATE FINDINGS <p> The aggregated findings on public assistance program enrollment , and the findings on expenditures by the federal government as well as the 50 states combined , offer a big picture of the hidden cost of low-wage work in America . Here we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in each individual state . <h> Enrollment <p> Table 4 ( page 6 ) provides a state-by-state break out of the program enrollment numbers for Medicaid/ CHIP , EITC , and SNAP . TANF data are not listed due to sample size constraints . <h> Expenditures <p> Federal Spending by State <p> Table 5 ( page 7 ) breaks out the data in Table 2 , showing the annual federal cost for the four public assistance programs by state . ( Note that the numbers in Table 2 are presented in billions of dollars , while the numbers in Table 5 are presented in millions of dollars . ) States with the highest percentage of their federal public assistance dollars going to working families include Alabama , Colorado , Hawaii , Idaho , Iowa , Nebraska , New Hampshire , North Dakota , Oklahoma , Texas , and Utah . <p> Individual State Spending <p> Finally , Table 6 ( page 8 ) breaks out the data in Table 3 , showing each states annual expenditures on Medicaid/ CHIP and TANF for working families ( 2013 dollars ) . Here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ individual state . <p> The states with the highest budgetary cost of low-wage work ( over $1 billion ) were California ( $3,676 million ) , New York ( $3,309 million ) , Texas ( $2,069 million ) , Illinois ( $1,098 million ) , and Florida ( $1,027 million ) . States with the highest percentage of their public assistance funds going to working families " in each instance over 60 percent " were New Hampshire , Texas , Oklahoma , Colorado , Utah , Hawaii , Nebraska , and Iowa . <h> Child Care Subsidies and Working Families <p> This report does not include all of the public assistance programs supported by federal and state dollars , because the data available on these other programs does not allow for the type of analysis we utilized . The largest programs not examined are those that provide funding for child care subsidies to low-income families . In 2013 , total child care funding included : $1.1 billion in federal TANF funds spent directly on child care $2.5 billion in additional state TANF Maintenance of Effort ( MOE ) $7.7 billion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( CCDBG ) funds11 Child care funding is overwhelmingly expended on working families . A 2014 Urban Institute study found that at least 83 percent of families receiving child care subsidies have a member of the family that works.12 Only a fraction of those eligible for child care subsidies currently receive them . According to a U.S. Department of Health and Human Service analysis of 2011 data , 13 among children eligible under federal rules only 17 percent received subsidized care , and among children eligible under state rules just 29 percent received subsidized care . Increasing wages would allow for a broader distribution of the available funding across families in need of assistance . <h> CONCLUSION <p> When jobs do n't  pay enough , workers turn to public assistance in order to meet their basic needs . These programs provide vital support to millions of working families whose employers pay less than a liveable wage . At both the state and federal levels , more than half of total spending on the public assistance programs analyzed in this report " Medicaid/CHIP , TANF , EITC , and food stamps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increases in employer-provided health insurance would result in significant Medicaid savings that states and the federal government could apply to other programs and priorities.14 In the case of TANF " a block grant that includes maintenance of effort ( MOE ) provisions that require specified state spending " higher wages would allow states to reduce the portion of the program going to cash assistance while increasing the funding for other services such as child care , job training , and transportation assistance . Higher wages would also significantly reduce federal expenditures on the EITC and SNAP.15 Overall , higher wages and employer provided health care would lower both state and federal public assistance costs , and allow all levels of government to better target how their tax dollars are used . <h> Appendix : Methods <p> To calculate the cost to state governments of public assistance programs for working families ( defined as having at least one family member who works 27 or more weeks per year and 10 or more hours per week ) , we mainly rely on two sources of data : the March Supplement of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) and administrative data from the Medicaid , CHIP , TANF , EITC , and food stamp programs . Medicaid figures exclude aged , blind , and disabled enrollees . The March Supplement , also known as the Annual Demographic Supplement , asks respondents about receipts of cash and non-cash transfer payments during the past year and includes questions about the programs we examined in this analysis . <p> To create the cost and enrollment estimates for Medicaid , CHIP , and TANF we use the CPS to calculate the share of program expenditures and the share of individual program enrollees who live in working families . We then apply those shares to the state-by-state individual enrollment and program cost totals provided in the administrative data to obtain the number of enrollees and total expenditure on enrollees from working families . For Medicaid and CHIP , we calculate each state governments share of expenditures by applying the states Federal Medical Assistance Percentage ( FMAP ) . The TANF administrative data break out each states TANF expenditures . <p> To create the cost and enrollment estimates for EITC and SNAP , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ totals match the administrative data . We then sum the number of enrolled families ( defined as having at least one family member participating in a program ) and the cost of their benefits to obtain the total program enrollment and cost .

But many of them work in jobs that pay wages so low that their paychecks do not generate enough income to provide for lifes basic necessities . Low wages paid by employers in the fast-food industry create especially acute problems for the families of workers in this industry . Median pay for core front-line fast-food jobs is $8.69 an hour , with many jobs paying at or near the minimum wage . Benefits are also scarce for front-line fast-food workers ; an estimated 87 percent do not receive health benefits through their employer . The combination of low wages and benefits , often coupled with part-time employment , means that many of the families of fast-food workers must rely on taxpayer-funded safety net programs to make ends meet . <p> This report estimates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Medicaid , the Earned Income Tax Credit and the other public benefits programs discussed in this report provide a vital support system for millions of Americans working in the United States service industries , including fast food . We analyze public program utilization by working families and estimate total average annual public benefit expenditures on the families of front-line fast-food workers for the years 2007-2011.1 For this analysis we focus on jobs held by core , front-line fast-food workers , defined as nonmanagerial workers who work at least 11 hours per week for 27 or more weeks per year . <h> Main Findings <p> More than half ( 52 percent ) of the families of front-line fast-food workers are enrolled in one or more public programs , compared to 25 percent of the workforce as a whole . <p> The cost of public assistance to families of workers in the fast-food industry is nearly $7 billion per year . <p> At an average of $3.9 billion per year , spending on Medicaid and the Childrens Health Insurance Program ( CHIP ) accounts for more than half of these costs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to live in or near poverty . One in five families with a member holding a fast-food job has an income below the poverty line , and 43 percent have an income two times the federal poverty level or less . <p> Even full-time hours are not enough to compensate for low wages . The families of more than half of the fast-food workers employed 40 or more hours per week are enrolled in public assistance programs . <h> Introduction <p> After years of losses , job growth has slowly returned to the U.S. economy . However , todays new jobs are often inadequate replacements for those recently lost . Middle-wage occupations accounted for 60 percent of employment losses between 2007 and 2009 , yet they represent just 20 percent of post-recession job growth.2 These numbers indicate that low-wage jobs lie at the center , rather than the margins , of the recovery . A recent analysis by the National Employment Law Project shows that low-wage positions account for nearly three out of five jobs generated in the first three years of economic recovery.3 <p> With jobs paying too little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number of working families must rely on publicly funded safety net programs to make ends meet . Together with six years of high unemployment rates , the growth in low-wage jobs without benefits has increased demand on the nations vital safety net system , which bears the burden when jobs do not pay enough . <p> Even at full time , the federal minimum wage of $7.25 per hour fails to provide sufficient income for workers to provide food , housing , health care , transportation and other basic needs for their families . Low work hours in many of the growing service sector industries reduce earnings even further . When employers pay poverty wages , workers must turn to public programs to meet their basic needs . Earned income tax credits , publicly subsidized health insurance , income support and food subsidies allow these working families to bridge the gap between their paychecks and subsistence . This is the public cost of low-wage jobs in America . The cost is public because taxpayers bear it . Yet it remains hidden in national policy debates about poverty , employment and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 63 percent ) of public benefits spending goes to working families-i.e. , families with a working member . With jobs that put their earnings below subsistence needs , our measurements indicate these families must rely on Medicaid , food stamps , the Earned Income Tax Credit and other support to provide the food , shelter and health care for which their jobs alone will not pay . <p> The fast-food industry stands out for both its low wages and its paucity of full-time work jobs . The median hourly wage for core nonmanagerial front-line fast-food workers , those working at least 27 weeks in a year and 10 hours a week , is $8.69 an hour.4 The median number of hours for these jobs is 30 . As a result , annual earnings in the fast-food industry are well below the income needed for self-sufficiency . Fast-food industry jobs are also much less likely than other jobs to provide health benefits . Only 13 percent of core front-line fast-food workers receive health benefits through their employer , compared to 59 percent of workers as a whole.5 <p> This paper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ combination of low wages , part- time work hours and low benefits in fast-food and other low-wage industries . To determine these costs , we draw on publicly available administrative and survey data on Medicaid , food stamps , the Earned Income Tax Credit and Temporary Assistance for Needy Families to fast-food workers and their households . We estimate the cost of these four programs for working families averaged $243 billion per year from 2007 to 2011 . The cost for families of front-line fast-food workers averaged nearly $7 billion a year . <p> Although extensive , the hidden public cost of low-wage work rarely factors into debates about state and national policy . The public benefits discussed in this report provide a vital support system for millions of the working poor . The findings of this report suggest those programs could be more effective if supplemented by measures that improve workers wages and benefits , either through public policy measures such as living and minimum wage laws , or through collective bargaining . <h> I. Data Sources and Methods <p> This section outlines our data sources and methods , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the report . <p> Public Programs Analyzed <p> We focus on four vital public benefits programs that account for hundreds of billions in assistance to working families : Health insurance ( Medicaid and Childrens Health Insurance Program , or CHIP , coverage ) , 6 the Federal Earned Income Tax Credit ( EITC ) , food stamps ( the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program , or SNAP ) and basic household income assistance ( Temporary Assistance for Needy Families , or TANF ) . To arrive at this list , we used the following criteria : <p> Major Means-Tested Programs Supporting Families and Workers . We limit the study to the largest nationwide programs that restrict benefits to families with low incomes . Our analysis covers programs used by families with active jobseekers and workers , even when the availability of those benefits does not depend on a familys working status . We analyze only programs that function as income supplements , omitting job-training , educational and other programs that indirectly assist low-income families . <p> Data Availability . An ideal analysis of the hidden public cost of low-wage work would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ programs , including child care subsidies and reduced-price school lunches . But our method for linking these costs to a workers employment status requires both national-level program enrollments and administrative data , and individual-level survey data on the benefits consumption of workers . As a result , our estimates necessarily exclude some federal and many state and local programs for which the required data were unavailable , such as state earned income tax credit programs and local services to the poor . <p> Data Sources <p> This report combines data from three sources . First , we gathered aggregate government administrative data for the four public support programs named above for all 50 states and Washington , D.C. These data document both the annual enrollment and the annual benefits paid by each program ( please note that we exclude the costs of program administration and oversight ) . Appendix A : Methodology provides detailed state-level program data . <p> Second , we used the March Supplement of the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics Current Population Survey ( CPS ) to obtain information on employment , worker demographics and public benefits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the total amount of public benefits paid to different groups of workers . To correct for the well-documented undercount of program enrollment in the CPS , we adjust the CPS so that estimated program costs match the administrative program data for each state.7 <p> To combine the CPS and administrative data , we selected a multiyear period ( 2007-2011 ) that minimized the impact of annual fluctuations in program costs and enrollment . For the Earned Income Tax Credit and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program , we were able to pool data for all five years . Because the release of administrative data for Temporary Assistance for Needy Families lags slightly , our data for that program cover the shorter 2007-2010 period . The release of Medicaid data lags an additional year , limiting our sample to the three-year period 2007-2009 . To link program costs to worker characteristics , we matched CPS data for the same time period to each program . <p> Using multiple years allows us to smooth the changes in enrollment and cost over the course of the recession . During the past decade , each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and aggregate benefits payouts . The 2007-2009 recession and the subsequent period of slow employment growth increased the working population eligible for public assistance . In some states policymakers responded to declines in state tax revenues by restricting program eligibility and benefits levels . Other states selectively expanded program eligibility , particularly for Medicaid and CHIP , in response to the widespread loss of jobs and employer-provided health insurance.8 We summarize these trends in Appendix B. <p> This process yielded national-level estimates of the hidden public cost of low-wage work . To translate those numbers into public benefits payments at the state level and to develop estimates for the fast-food industry , we constructed a model that made it possible to integrate data from a third source , the U.S. Census Bureaus American Community Survey ( ACS ) , which contains a larger sample size than the CPS . The use of the ACS allows us to estimate costs for all U.S. workers , for our subset of front-line fast-food workers and for some states with large populations . Since the ACS and CPS do not separate full-service and limited- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ firm-provided data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics Occupational and Employment Statistics ( OES ) to identify restaurant occupations that are primarily limited service , and to adjust the total counts for the workforce to correct for limitations in the individual survey data . In doing so , we use a conservative definition of front-line fast-food workers , including only workers directly employed in restaurants and excluding managerial positions . <p> From our ACS sample and our estimate of total front-line fast-food workers we exclude those with only a marginal attachment to the workforce . To be included in the analysis , a worker had to meet the requirement of working at least 27 weeks and at least 10 hours per week in a given year . Sixty-five percent of nonmanagerial front-line fast-food workers in the sample met these criteria.9 <p> Additionally , our analysis can not take into account enrollment in other federal or state programs for which data are not readily available . These programs include Child Care Assistance , Women , Infants and Children Nutrition Program , Free or Reduced Price Lunches , Section 8 Housing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state-based programs . Previous analyses of these programs find that significant shares of their expenditures likewise support low-income , working families.10 This report focuses only on the largest federal public assistance programs and covers a limited segment of the fast-food workforce . Thus , our estimates of both program enrollments and costs are conservative , and by definition undercount total public costs . <p> A final methodological specification concerns the family basis of public benefits programs . While low earnings is the basic criterion for program eligibility , public benefits do not necessarily go directly to the worker . For example , some workers have neither public nor private health insurance , but enroll their children in the CHIP program . Other benefits , such as SNAP and EITC , are provided at the family level . Accordingly , our measure of public benefits to employed workers covers benefits provided to the family as a whole , rather than only those provided directly and exclusively to the worker . For a detailed explanation of this process , see Appendix A. <h> II . Findings <p> Public Program enrollment and Costs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Medicaid and the Childrens Health Insurance Program ( CHIP ) , the Earned Income Tax Credit , food stamps and Temporary Assistance for Needy Families averaged $385.72 billion annually.11 <p> Medicaid and CHIP account for more than two-thirds of total costs ( Table 1 ) . The next most costly programs , the Earned Income Tax Credit ( $58.61 billion annually ) and food stamps ( $55.93 billion annually ) , account for just under 30 percent of total benefits costs . At $9.88 billion per year , TANF amounts to less than 3 percent of total benefits costs . This widespread variation in program costs reflects differences in the cost of benefits , varying restrictions on eligibility for employed individuals and broad reductions in TANF enrollments and assistance levels . <p> Program enrollment by Working Families <p> We next estimate the share of people participating in the four programs who are in working families , and the share of the cost of the programs attributable to these families . We find that working families account for 73 percent of all program enrollments and 63 percent of total program @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ total cost of assistance to working families from the four programs averaged $243 billion per year between 2007 and 2011 . <p> With the exception of TANF , which restricts eligibility to extremely low-income levels , working families account for a majority of the cost of every public benefits program in our sample . The Earned Income Tax Credit ( EITC ) , which is targeted specifically at working families , accounts for the largest share of enrollment . While fewer working families participate in Medicaid and CHIP than the EITC , these two programs account for 60 percent of the cost of public assistance to working families for the four programs analyzed ( $146 billion ) . ( Estimates for larger states can be found in Appendix C. ) <p> Which Industries Have the Highest Levels of Program enrollment ? <p> Because public support programs are structured to provide needed assistance to low-income households , it seems likely that lower-wage industries will account for a disproportionately large share of program costs . Our estimates indicate this is indeed the case . Figure 2 ( page 7 ) shows the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ industry . The restaurants and food services sector ( 44 percent ) has the highest public program participation rate of any industry . As expected , the list of industries with the highest participation rates is dominated by the service sector . One-third of the families with a worker in " other services " -including personal services , laundry services and repair and maintenance services-receive public assistance , as do 30 percent of the families with a worker in the retail industry or in leisure and hospitality . <p> We next look at a subset of employees in the restaurant industry-core front-line fast-food workers . These workers and their families are more than twice as likely as working families in general to be enrolled in public programs . Overall , we find that 52 percent of the families of front-line fast-food workers participate in at least one public benefits program compared to 25 percent of all working families . In other words , public benefits receipt is the rule , rather than the exception , for this workforce . <p> We find the total cost of public programs for families @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ per year between 2007 and 2011 ( Table 3 , page 7 ) . More than 800,000 families of front-line fast-food workers ( 45 percent ) participate in the Earned Income Tax Credit , nearly double the number that enroll in any other program . However , the Earned Income Tax Credit is less expensive than other programs on a household basis , with average benefits of approximately $2,380 for the families of front-line fast- food workers . The number of families with adults enrolled in Medicaid , 340,000 , is significantly smaller . But owing to significantly higher program costs , Medicaid accounts for more total spending on fast-food workers and their families than any other program . Spending on the two health programs combined was $3.98 billion , followed by EITC at $1.91 billion and food stamps at $1.04 billion . <p> The high participation rate of families of core fast-food workers in public programs can be attributed to three major factors : the industrys low wages , low work hours and low benefits . In 2011 , the median front- line fast-food worker working at least 27 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an hour ( Figure 3 ) . The 10th percentile earned $7.67 an hour , while the 90th percentile earned $10.44 an hour . The median wage for the United States workforce as a whole in 2011 was $16.57 . <p> Along with low pay , the fast-food industry has low rates of health care coverage . Overall , 13 percent of core front-line fast-food workers receive health benefits through their employer , compared to 59 percent for the workforce as a whole . When we restrict the analysis to workers employed 30 hours or more per week , the share enrolled in employer-sponsored health insurance programs provided by their employer rises slightly , to 17 percent.13 <p> Fast-food jobs are also more likely to be part-time jobs . Even restricting to the core workforce , we find the median fast-food employee works 30 hours per week , compared to 40 for the workforce as a whole . Nearly half ( 46 percent ) of core front-line fast-food jobs provide between 20 and 35 hours of employment per week . This combination of low pay and limited work hours results @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ low pay may in some cases be offset by earnings from other family members , workers in the fast-food industry are twice as likely to be members of families with earnings below or near poverty than the workforce as a whole15 ( Table 4 , page 9 ) . Approximately 20 percent of front-line fast-food workers live in families with incomes below the federal poverty level , compared to just 5 percent of workers as a whole.15 An additional 23 percent of fast-food families are near poor with incomes between 100 percent and 199 percent of the federal poverty level , compared to 13 percent in the workforce as whole . Overall , these families are made up of historically disadvantaged classes of workers . More than two out of five front-line fast-food workers are African American ( 23 percent ) or Latino ( 20 percent ) , and 73 percent of workers are women . <p> To measure whether the high utilization of public programs in the fast-food industry relative to other industries is mainly caused by low work hours , we calculate program utilization by hours worked for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shows the participation rates in public programs for fast- food employees by work hours . Fast-food workers are far more likely to work short hours that limit total potential weekly take-home pay . Of the total workforce , just 4 percent work between 10 and 20 hours per week , but 12 percent of fast-food workers do , and 43 percent of those workers families participate in public programs . At the other end of the spectrum , a 40-hour workweek is the exception rather than the rule in fast food . Just 28 percent of core front-line fast-food workers regularly work 40 or more hours per week , compared to 75 percent of the workforce as a whole . Even at 40 hours a week , however , more than half ( 52 percent ) of front-line fast-food workers families participate in public programs . These figures underscore that poverty level incomes for households with front-line fast-food workers do not just result from low wages , but also from a limited number of paid hours . <h> III . Policy Implications <p> The popular notion is that fast-food workers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Analyzing the core workforce , those working at least 27 weeks per year and 10 hours or more per week , provides a very different picture . The share of these workers who are under the age of 19 and living with a parent ( 18 percent ) is smaller than the share with children of their own ( 26 percent ) . Overall , 68 percent of the core front-line workers in the fast-food industry are not in school and are single or married adults with or without children . For more than two-thirds of these workers , fast-food wages are an essential component of family income . <p> Because pay is low and weekly work hours are limited , the families of more than half of the workers in the fast-food industry are unable to make ends meet without enrolling in public programs . These families are twice as likely as working families in general to require public aid . Our conservative measurements indicate this public assistance carries a minimum annual price tag of nearly $7 billion . <p> Low wages , benefits and work hours in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fast- food workers and others whose jobs pay too little to provide for food , shelter , health care and other basic necessities , Medicaid , the Earned Income Tax Credit , the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program and Temporary Aid for Needy Families are indispensable programs . These programs provide a last line of defense between Americas growing low-income workforce and the want of basic necessities . The results of this report suggest these programs would be more effective if they were combined with measures to improve wages and health benefits among low-wage workers . <p> The data we have assembled indicate working families would directly benefit from improved pay and hours in the fast-food industry . We show that fast-food workers live in poorer families compared to other workers , they are primarily adults and they require public assistance at a higher rate than the workforce as a whole . This is true even among full-time workers , and among teenage workers whose families require public support at a higher rate than do the families of other teenagers.16 Together , these factors indicate that raising fast-food wages would provide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The concentration of high program participation rates in nonexporting industries-food service , leisure and hospitality , retail , construction-indicates a second important reason to endorse efforts to raise wages for low-wage workers . Unlike manufacturers , who are not a major employer of low-wage workers and who must compete with offshore producers with lower labor and production costs , the service industries employing low-wage Americans compete on a domestic and level playing field . Rather than reflecting the competitive dictates of global product markets , the low-wage structure of fast-food and other domestic service industries reflects a mixture of market conditions and policy choices about minimum standards for work . <p> Pay in the fast-food industry could be increased through a variety of means . Many fast-food workers earn close to the minimum wage and would benefit from an increase in the minimum wage or through targeted local laws to raise labor standards . Collective bargaining in the fast-food industry would increase wage and benefits standards in correspondence to the markets in specific geographic areas and the economics of particular market segments . Very few fast-food restaurants currently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , improving wages and health benefits in the industry would improve the living standards of low-income families while reducing the public cost of low-wage work . <h> Appendix A : Methodology <p> We build our estimates of the public cost of low-wage work by combining publicly available data on costs and participation levels for public benefits programs with datasets providing information on the demographics , employment and public program participation of U.S. workers . While costs and participation levels on public programs are available from administrative datasets , those data only provide information on aggregate program participation . Our methodology makes it possible to determine the cost of public benefits payments to individual subgroups of the population , specifically working families and families with fast-food workers . In this report , we extend our previous work on the participation levels and incurred costs of low-wage work in California , Illinois , Wisconsin and New York17 to answer questions not just about particular states , but about the country as a whole . After compiling administrative data for basic public benefits programs , we followed a three-step approach : Step 1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Step 2 : Model program participation and costs , applying model to the American Community Survey . Step 3 : Adjust American Community Survey data to match state-level administrative data . <p> Following the approach first established by Zabin , Dube and Jacobs in the 2004 report " The Hidden Public Cost of Low-Wage Jobs in California , " we adjust the weights of data from the March Supplement to the CPS so that costs for each of the public programs match state-level administrative data . For a detailed account of this process , consult the technical appendix from our previous report , " The Hidden Public Cost of Low- Wage Work in Illinois . " <p> With a few exceptions , our adjustments to program participation information in the CPS increase enrollment estimates , due to underreporting in the CPS.18 In general , our reweighting procedure led to relatively small adjustments to enrollments for Medicaid and food stamps ( 20 to 25 percent ) , larger adjustments for the Earned Income Tax Credit ( more than 100 percent , on average ) and a wide range for TANF @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for total program costs were much smaller overall : Medicaid ( -2.3 percent ) , food stamps ( 17 percent ) , the Earned Income Tax Credit ( -5 to -15 percent on average ) and TANF ( between 5 percent and 27 percent , depending on the state ) . <p> Average annual enrollment and costs for each program , by state , are shown in Tables A1 and A2 ( pages 13 through 15 ) . <p> Step 2 : Modeling Program Participation and Cost Information from the CPs and Applying to the American Community survey ( ACs ) <p> While the CPS contains both enrollment and cost estimates of public programs , the sample sizes available are too small to provide estimates of subpopulations , such as workers in fast-food restaurants . In response , we incorporated data from the American Community Survey ( ACS ) , 19 which has a much larger sample but less information on participation in public programs . The ACS questionnaire asks about Medicaid and food stamps , but omits the EITC and does not distinguish between TANF and other welfare assistance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surveys by modeling program enrollment for the working population in the CPS and applying this model to the working population in the ACS . More precisely , for each worker , we model the likelihood of anyone in the workers family participating in the program and the cost of the program for all enrolled members of the workers family . We model participation with a logistic regression predicting the probability of ACS-documented participation in the program as a result of basic work- relevant demographic variables . For families that are enrolled , program costs are modeled using linear regression and result in an expected program cost conditional on enrollment . Modeling for EITC , food stamps and TANF is done with the national sample . Modeling for Medicaid is done on a state-by-state basis to account for the different eligibility requirements in adult and childrens Medicaid and CHIP . <p> We use the following explanatory variables in the prediction models when coefficients were statistically significant at the 5 percent level : <p> Hourly wage over previous year <p> Family income of previous year <p> Age <p> Federal Poverty Level ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to 149 percent , 150 to 199 percent , 200 to 249 percent , 250 to 299 percent , 300 percent and more ) Number of adults older than 18 in family ( 0,1,2,3,4 or more ) Number of children 18 and younger in family ( 0,1,2,3,4,5 or more ) <p> Educational degree attainment ( no high school diploma , high school diploma , some college , bachelors degree or higher ) <p> After applying the prediction models , for each public program the ith worker will have an associated p , the predicted family participation and a ci , the expected family program costs conditional on a member of the family being enrolled . If the ACS sample weight is denoted wi then for any subpopulation S the total number of workers enrolled in the program equals : <p> + pi * wi <p> And the total program costs attributable to workers equals <p> + ci * pi * wi <p> Step 3 : Adjusting the ACs to Match enrollment Information of Workers in the CPs <p> To ensure the working population in the ACS mirrors the enrollment for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ modifications . First , for each program and for each state , the program participation rates of workers in the ACS are linearly adjusted to equal the participation rates of workers in the CPS . Next , for each program and for each state , the expected family program costs , conditional on enrollment in the ACS , are linearly adjusted to equal the average family program costs of working individuals in the CPS . <p> A review of the state-by-state adjustments for participation show : Medicaid adult participation is over predicted by the model , leading to downward adjustments ( -17 to 0 percent ) ; Medicaid child participation adjustments are small and centered around zero ( -10 to 10 percent ) ; and , with a few exceptions ( e.g. , Vermont , Nebraska and Washington , D.C. ) , EITC , food stamps and TANF participation adjustments vary widely as they were modeled on a state-by-state basis . Separately , an adjustment is done for a dummy variable indicating participation in any of the four programs which leads to small changes ( -10 percent to 10 percent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were smaller : Medicaid adult cost adjustments were centered at zero ( -12 to 10 percent ) ; Medicaid child adjustments tended negative ( -40 to 8 percent ) ; food stamp adjustments were more moderate than those for participation ( -10 to 22 percent ) as were EITC adjustments ( -10 to 24 percent ) ; and TANF adjustments varied widely . <p> Defining Fast-Food Workers in the ACs and estimating the total Number of Fast-Food Workers in the U.s . <p> The identification of all front-line fast-food workers is not directly possible for any available large scale dataset with information on the worker characteristics required for this study , including the CPS and ACS . The ACS , which we use for estimation , does have a specific +G-Restaurant Industry code but it does not distinguish between full- or limited-service restaurants-the latter representing fast food . To address this issue , we combine occupation codes within the broad restaurant industry from the ACS with data from a firm survey , the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics Occupational Employment Survey ( OES ) , that distinguishes between limited-service ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makes it possible to identify front-line fast-food workers in our ACS sample and to further provide an estimate of the population of front-line fast- food workers in the United States . <p> The OES is a survey of 200,000 establishments per panel ( every six months ) , which takes three years to fully collect the sample of 1.2 million establishments . The OES reports annual employment and wage estimates for more than 800 occupations within individual industries , including separate measures for LS and FS restaurants . We use the occupations within LS restaurants from the OES to determine what occupations to analyze in the ACS that will best identify front-line fast-food workers . <p> Examining the distribution of occupations in the OES across LS and FS restaurants allows us to determine which occupations within the broader ACS Restaurant Industry have a high share of workers in the LS sector . We further determine which occupations within LS represent front-line fast-food workers . For example , we omitted " Public Relations Specialist , " " Executive Administrators " and other occupations clearly not involved in preparing and selling fast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ front-line fast-food occupations are also identified in the ACS . It is important to note that occupational coding across the two datasets is only the same for select occupations . The occupations with the highest share of workers in LS restaurants that also represented front-line workers are : " Combined Food Preparation and Service Workers " ( 95 percent are employed in limited service ) , " Counter Attendants , etc. " ( 92 percent ) and " Cashiers " ( 75 percent ) . Because the ACS uses the same classifications verbatim for these occupations , we restricted our ACS sample to Restaurant Industry workers employed in these three occupations . This definition excludes some workers integral to front-line fast-food work , such as cooks . But , as noted above , the ACS does not distinguish between cooks in limited- or full- service restaurants and we know from the OES that only 31 percent of restaurant industry cooks work in fast food . <p> To estimate the total count of U.S. fast-food workers , we use a separate , narrow definition of core front- line fast-food workers based @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the OES for " Combined Food Preparation and Serving Workers , Including Fast Food " and " Cooks , Fast Food " in the OES . We omit " Counter Attendants and Cashiers " from this estimate . While those occupations constitute ideal modeling proxies for fast-food work in the ACS , many workers in them work in jobs commonly not identified as fast food . As a result , their inclusion may overstate the total estimated count of fast-food workers . Our narrower definition of core , front-line fast-food workers accounts for 2.5 million of the 4.1 million in the LS workforce as documented in the OES . It excludes managers , supervisors and employees such as truck drivers not working directly in restaurants . It also excludes coffee shop , cafeteria and food concession workers , who could be considered fast-food workers . Including those occupations would add an additional 400,000 workers to the total , and would increase the cost estimates by 16 percent , to $8 billion . <p> To validate that the occupations used to model front-line fast-food workers in the ACS provide a reasonable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these occupations to the " Cooks , Fast Food " occupation , which by definition consists of only fast-food workers in the LS sector . The median wage for " Cooks , Fast Food " in the OES is $8.94 , compared to $8.69 for the three occupations used in the ACS modeling . The similarity in wages between occupations we modeled as containing large numbers of fast- food workers , and an occupational group limited solely to fast-food workers , provides confidence that our ACS sample serves as a good proxy for the larger group . <p> The two OES occupational categories that we use as an estimate of the universe of front-line fast-food workers account for 62.3 percent of all workers in the LS restaurant industry . Further restricting on weeks and hours brings our total universe of core front-line fast-food workers to 1,823,000-as we lose 29.5 percent of the total sample employed less than 10 hours per week and/or less than 26 weeks per year . As a result , this report provides a conservative estimate of the total cost of public assistance programs associated with front-line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. Public Benefits Programs <h> Appendix C : State-Level Estimates for Famillies of Fast-Food Workers <p> Estimates for statewide participation rates in each of the public programs , and the associated costs , for the families of fast-food workers are included in the two tables below . Due to sample size limitations , we omitted estimates for those states where the number of year-round fast-food workers in the ACS sample fell below 500 individuals . Additionally , TANF enrollment and costs are not shown due to the low enrollment in the program but are included in the total . <p> See Meyer , Bruce D. and James X. Sullivan . 2008 . " Reporting Bias in Studies of the Food Stamp Program . " Chicago : Harris School of Public Policy Studies , University of Chicago . Because direct program enrollment and payment data represent a definitive and accurate measure of public benefits payments , lower estimates from the CPS by definition represent undercounting .

These guidelines are designed to help potential students strengthen their applications .

Since the composition of this committee changes frequently and the pool of applicants changes each year , we do not use rigid rules in determining admissions . Nonetheless , the following guidelines are used as a starting point in our deliberations . <h> Formal Records <p> Formal records are relied upon heavily . We will not consider a student with a grade point average ( GPA ) below 3.0 , which is the University 's minimum standard for graduate admission . Typically , we consider the overall GPA , the economics GPA , and the GPA in mathematics , statistics , and other quantitative methods , with particularly heavy weight on the economics and mathematics grades . <p> Many of our applicants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from other institutions . When grades in graduate courses are available , we put greater weight on those than on undergraduate grades . <h> Standardized Tests <p> When students have attended colleges and universities with which we are not familiar , greater weight is placed on the GRE examinations . Particular weight is placed on the quantitative , but the analytical and verbal are also considered . <h> Personal Statement <p> The essay by the applicant is also given substantial weight . We are looking for students who have clear and reasonable objectives . We want to know why the applicant wants to study agricultural and resource economics at Berkeley and how this training will be used . <h> Letters of Recommendation <p> Letters of recommendation are given considerable attention . We put particular weight on letters from people who have previously recommended students who have done well in our program . <h> Publications <p> In some cases , an applicant may already have a paper accepted for publication in an economics journal . If so , this information may weigh heavily in the applicant 's favor , and may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Employment Experience <p> We only admit students who have prior training in economics and quantitative methods . At the very minimum , a student should have taken intermediate level micro-economics and macro-economics courses and a year of calculus .

Students need to have completed a course in real and functional analysis equivalent to Berkeley 's Math 104 before being allowed to take the graduate microeconomics theory- sequence at Berkeley . We highly recommend taking such a course before arriving at Berkeley . If you have taken a real analysis course in another university , please upload the syllabus with your application . <p> We may make exceptions for students who do not meet these guidelines if they have other characteristics or experiences that we believe are important , such as professional experience or graduate training in fields relevant to the core research interests of the department , yet academic preparation is an excellent predictor of success in our graduate program . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

We recommend that foreign students provide an official explanation of the grading system and explain in some detail the content of the courses they have taken . <h> Preparing for Graduate Admissions <p> An applicant should hold a degree comparable to a Bachelor 's degree at the University of California and must have demonstrated strong scholarship potential .

@@11574719 @174719/ <p> What is the universe made of ? This is one of the most basic questions humanity has had about the world surrounding us , but has proven one of the most difficult to answer . Our knowledge of matter and energy has progressed rapidly over the last few centuries , leading to a detailed understanding of nearly all of the materials and phenomena around us . Scientists have even begun to understand the principles that have shaped the evolution of our universe itself over the past few billion years . <p> One of the most shocking discoveries of recent science , however , is that we have much yet to learn . Only a tiny fraction of the universe seems to be composed of the protons , neutrons , and electrons we have labored so long to understand . The identity of the vast majority of the cosmos remains a mystery ! <p> Our present understanding of the universe 's composition is roughly as follows : <p> Baryonic Matter : 5% of the mass in the universe This is ordinary matter composed of protons , neutrons , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ planets , people , etc . <p> Cold Dark Matter : 25% This is the so-called " missing mass " of the universe . It comprises the dark matter halos that surround galaxies and galaxy clusters , and aids in the formation of structure in the universe . The dark matter is said to be " cold " because it is nonrelativistic ( slow-moving ) during the era of structure formation . Dark matter is currently believed to be composed of some kind of new elementary particle , usually referred to as a weakly interacting massive particle ( WIMP ) . <p> Dark Energy : 70% Through observations of distant supernovae , two research groups have independently discovered that the expansion of the universe appears to be getting faster with time . This seems to require some kind of " antigravity " effect which we do not understand . Cosmologists believe that the acceleration may be caused by some kind of new energy field that permeates the universe , perhaps even the cosmological constant that Einstein imagined almost a century ago . Whatever the source of this phenomenon turns out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ energy . <p> The focus of these pages is on the second of these components - cold dark matter .

Full face photographic images and any comparable images ; and 18 . Any other unique identifying number , characteristic , or code ( note this does not mean the unique code assigned by the investigator to code the data ) <p> There are also additional standards and criteria to protect individual 's privacy from re-identification . Any code used to replace the identifiers in datasets can not be derived from any information related to the individual and the master codes , nor can the method to derive the codes be disclosed . For example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ code their data because the initials are derived from their name . Additionally , the researcher must not have actual knowledge that the research subject could be re-identified from the remaining identifiers in the PHI used in the research study . In other words , the information would still be considered identifiable is there was a way to identify the individual even though all of the 18 identifiers were removed . <h> Definition <h> What is PHI ? <p> Protected health information ( PHI ) is any information in the medical record or designated record set that can be used to identify an individual and that was created , used , or disclosed in the course of providing a health care service such as diagnosis or treatment . HIPAA regulations allow researchers to access and use PHI when necessary to conduct research . However , HIPAA only affects research that uses , creates , or discloses PHI that will be entered in to the medical record or will be used for healthcare services , such as treatment , payment or operations . <p> For example , PHI is used in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ information , such as retrospective chart review . Also , studies that create new medical information because a health care service is being performed as part of research , such as diagnosing a health condition or a new drug or device for treating a health condition , create PHI that will be entered into the medical record . For example , sponsored clinical trails that submit data to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration involve PHI and are therefore subject to HIPAA regulations . <h> What is not PHI ? <p> In contrast , some research studies use data that is person-identifiable because it includes personal identifiers such as name , address , but it is not considered to be PHI because the data are not associated with or derived from a healthcare service event ( treatment , payment , operations , medical records ) not entered into the medical records , nor will the subject/patient be informed of the results . Research health information that is kept only in the researchers records is not subject to HIPAA but is regulated by other human subjects protection regulations . <p> Examples @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ studies as the use of aggregate data , diagnostic tests that do not go into the medical record because they are part of a basic research study and the results will not be disclosed to the subject , and testing done without the PHI identifiers . Some genetic basic research can fall into this category such as the search for potential genetic markers , promoter control elements , and other exploratory genetic research . In contrast , genetic testing for a known disease that is considered to be part of diagnosis , treatment and health care would be considered to use PHI and therefore subject to HIPAA regulations . <p> Also note , health information by itself without the 18 identifiers is not considered to be PHI . For example , a dataset of vital signs by themselves do not constitute protected health information . However , if the vital signs dataset includes medical record numbers , then the entire dataset must be protected since it contains an identifier . PHI is anything that can be used to identify an individual such as private information , facial images , fingerprints @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ records , biological specimens , biometrics , data sets , as well as direct identifiers of the research subjects in clinical trials .

@@11574802 @174802/ <h> Search form <h> Faculty Research Interests <p> I do research in mathematical probability . A central theme is the study of large finite random structures , obtaining asymptotic behavior as the size tends to infinity via consideration of some suitable infinite random structure . Much current work involves random network models . For more detailed prose see my research page . You will find a recent talk on this style of research here . <p> My research interests are in the areas of machine learning , statistical learning theory , and reinforcement learning . I work on the theoreticalanalysis of computationally efficient methods for large or otherwise complex prediction problems . One example is structured prediction problems , where there is considerable complexity to the space of possible predictions . Such methods are important in a variety of application areas , including natural language processing , computer vision , and bioinformatics . A second area of interest is the analysis of prediction methods in a deterministic , game-theoretic setting . As well as being of interest in areas such as computer security , where an adversarial environment is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the design and understanding of prediction methods in a probabilistic setting . A third area of interest is the design of methods for large scale sequential decision problems , such as control of Markov decision processes . Again , computational efficiency is a crucial requirement . This is a common feature in all of these areas : the interplay between the constraint of computational efficiency and the statistical properties of a method . <p> My main theoretical interest is in understanding why we are able to do statistics as well as we do on very high dimensional datasets without knowing much , even though least favorable ( malicious God ) formulations suggest we should not be able to do anything . Currently this has led me to focus on estimation of covariance matrices and their eigenstructures in high dimensions . Parallel applied interests are in : <p> Computational biology , specifically at the moment regulatory networks in the cell . To my surprise some of the methods flowing out of my primary interest are relevant to this one . <p> Atmospheric sciences ... in part as a ready source of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recent research focuses on statistical methods for random processes , random process data analysis and applications in engineering and science generally . Particular topics include : modelling the motion of animals and other entities and risk analysis for earthquakes , wildfires , floods , and similar phenomena . I also work some on sports statistics , am President of The International Environmetrics Society ( TIES ) and am Deputy Editor of the journal Environmetrics . <p> Statistical design of experiments , originated from agricultural applications , is used extensively in a wide range of scientific and industrial investigations . Experiments need to be properly designed so that valid information can be extracted at a lower cost . I am interested in efficient experimental designs and the related construction and combinatorial problems . Currently , I work mostly on design of experiments in the situation where the response depends on a large number of factors ( variables ) , the so called factorial design . When a large number of factors have to be studied , but the experimental runs are expensive , it is not feasible to observe all possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two settings for each factor , an experiment with 10 factors requires 210 runs to observe all the combinations . One aspect of my research deals with how to choose a " good " small subset of the factor combinations . There are interesting connections with combinatorics , coding theory and finite geometry . <p> My research and teaching activities concern the development and application of statistical and computational methods to address problems in biomedical and genomic research . The statistical inference questions are truly multivariate and involve the joint analysis of multiple , diverse , and high-dimensional datasets . High-throughput assays such as microarrays and next-generation sequencers allow biologists to monitor expression levels for entire genomes . A challenging task is to relate these genome-wide genotypes to biological and clinical covariates ( e.g. , age , sex , environmental exposure ) and outcomes ( e.g. , cell type/state , **27;233;TOOLONG , survival time , response to treatment ) as well as to the wealth of biological annotation metadata available on the web ( e.g. Gene Ontology , KEGG pathways , PubMed literature ) . Motivated by these biological challenges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ areas : loss-based estimation with cross-validation ( parametric and non-parametric density estimation and regression , variable selection ) and resampling-based multiple hypothesis testing . I am also interested in statistical computing and I am a core developer of the Bioconductor Project , an open-source and open-development software project for the analysis of biomedical and genomic data . <p> I 'm mostly interested in statistical problems for high-dimensional data . More specifically , I have been working on covariance estimation for large dimensional data . It 's an important practical topic because a lot of data analysis relies on having good estimates of covariance . It 's also very interesting because a lot of classical results break down ( rather badly ) in high-dimensions . So on the theory side , I study questions motivated by applications and ask myself how badly standard things break down and how I can describe what sort of " strange " phenomena happen . More practically , I try to use this understanding to come up with new methods that are computationally feasible and fix the problems I 've identified . At the end of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , from data analysis , to algorithms to questions that straddle theoretical statistics and modern probability theory . Right now , I 'm starting to use these insights in some problems arising in Finance , having mostly to do with portfolio optimization .

In the past , I have collaborated with Persi Diaconis and others on random matrices and various other aspects of probability on algebraic structures . I have numerous publications with Martin Barlow , Ed Perkins , Klaus Fleischmann , Tom Kurtz , Xiaowen Zhou , and Peter Donnelly on Dawson-Watanabe superprocesses and other measure-valued processes that arise in population biology , as well as with Jim Pitman on various coalescent models that appear in biology , chemistry and astrophysics . In the past , I have worked with Terry Speed , Mary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invariants and interference regarding recombination . <p> I share an ongoing interest in biodemography with David Steinsaltz and Ken Wachter that has resulted in papers on fitness landscapes , mutation-selection balance , stochastic PDE models of bacteria and yeast aging , and applications of quasistationarity to mortality modeling . <p> I continue research on probability and real trees , particularly applications of ideas from metric geometry such as the Gromov-Hausdorff metric , some of it in collaboration with Tye Lidman , Jim Pitman , and Anita Winter . I am investigating tree statistics and most recent common ancestors in diploid populations with Erick Matsen . Monty Slatkin and I are researching allele frequency spectra for time-varying population sizes . <p> I am in the middle of an extensive project involving Tandy Warnow , Don Ringe , Luay Nakhleh , and Francois Barbancon on several aspects of phylogenetic inference - particularly applications of computational phylogenetic methods in historical linguistics . <p> I currently have students working on stepping stone models and coalescent sticky flows , the population genetics of hybrid zones , random matrices associated with Coxeter groups , random matrices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ systems applied to mutation-selection balance , and connections between matrix-valued orthogonal polynomials and queuing theory . <h> Lisa Goldberg <p> My primary interest is the development of a broad , widely applicable , statistically sound , quantitative framework for measuring and managing financial risk . This is very topical and important , given the turbulence that has plagued financial markets during the last twelve months .

Many of my research articles can be found in the MSCI Barra Research Library , and some are posted on the Social Sciences Research Network . <h> Leo Goodman <p> My research interests include the development of statistical methods for the analysis of data that are qualitative or categorical , and statistical methodology in the social sciences .

My current focuses are : 1 ) develop statistical methods that provide a consistent formulation between the statistical modeling and the biological nature of data , 2 ) understand and solve the problem of unreliable estimates in analyzing high dimensional structured data , and 3 ) tackle the challenges posed by the high level of noise and the lack of reproducibility in the datasets from different resources . <p> As a biostatistician , my research focuses on the application of novel statistical techniques to the design , analysis and interpretation of data arising from public health and human disease studies .

I 'm most interested in problems that arise when working with non-traditional data types ; examples I 've worked with include document corpora , graphs , protein structures , phylogenies and multi-media signals . Working with these kinds of data types often leads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where classical methods can be infeasible on computational grounds . I 've thus been interested in new computational methods for large-scale problems ; specifically I 've worked on the development of novel estimators using tools from constrained optimization theory and convex analysis . I 'm also interested in the interface between probability theory and nonparametric statistics , particularly in the setting known as " nonparametric Bayes " , where the prior distribution is a general stochastic process . Here ideas familiar in modern probability theory , such as the Chinese restaurant process and stick-breaking distributions , yield novel statistical models and novel inference procedures . These methods have numerous applications in areas such as statistical genetics , image processing and natural language processing . I 'm quite interested in pursuing these applications , particularly in collaboration with biologists and computer scientists . <h> Michael Klass <p> My research interests are in probability theory . I have done research on sums of independent random variables , laws of the iterated logarithm , approximations of tail probabilities , operator limit theorems for sums of independent random vectors , expectations of functions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as well as arbitrary self-normalized sums . <p> My work focuses on the development and application of statistical methods in genomics . Most of it concentrates on making inferences regarding function and evolution from molecular and genetic data .

Examples include evolutionary analyses of whole genome data from a diverse set of organisms including bacteria , the Giant Panda , the Rhesus Macaque monkey , humans , and chimpanzees , development of methods for association mapping which can accommodate non-linear interactions , and the development of MCMC methods for inferring demographic parameters in population genetics . <p> One of my current interests is in the area of cyber-infrastructure for education .

This has led to the study of various measure-valued and partition-valued Markov processes whose behaviour may be understood in terms of combinatorial constructions involving random trees . I am at present engaged in developing various ideas related to random partitions , random trees , irreversible processes of coalescence , and their time reversals which provide models for random splitting or fragmentation . <p> I view this line of research largely as pure mathematics , but mathematics of a concrete kind which is often motivated and influenced by applications .

I have enjoyed interactions with researchers in many areas , especially the natural sciences , which have given me opportunities to learn about these fields and to make contributions to them . Underlying these separate analyses are paradigms of statistical methodology that have been developed over the last 100 years . This evolution accelerates as statisticians confront new challenges in the information age . <p> I am especially interested in developing methods for analyzing data that arise in the form of random functions , such as time series , and which involve large quantities of data and computationally intensive analysis .

I 've done research on the internal structure of Sun and Earth , climate modeling , earthquake prediction , the Big Bang , the geomagnetic field , election auditing , geriatric hearing loss , the U.S. census , the effectiveness of Internet content filters , endangered species , spectrum estimation , urban foraging , and information retrieval . I am interested in numerical optimization , and have published some software . <p> I am mathematician with a wide range of interests ranging from combinatorics and algebraic geometry to optimization and computational biology . I have always been fascinated with numerical experiments and data analysis , and this led me quite naturally into the emerging field of algebraic statistics . Here I have worked on phylogenetics , Markov bases , symbolic computation of Bayesian integrals , likelihood inference , and the geometry of conditional independence models for discrete and Gaussian random variables . <p> The goal of my research group is to develop statistical methods to estimate/learn causal and non-causal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dimensional data from randomized clinical trials or observational longitudinal studies , or from cross-sectional ( e.g. , case-control sampling ) studies . The model assumptions under which these methods are valid should be clearly formulated , so that they can be subject to scrutiny . The estimates should be accompanied by confidence regions for the true parameter values or other types of confidence measures ( e.g. , **27;290;TOOLONG of clusters as measured by the bootstrap ) . The longitudinal data structures may involve high dimensional measurements such as whole genome profiles at various points in time ; censoring and missingness of data due to a subject not responding well to treatment ( or not feeling well ) ; and changes of treatment at various points in time , based on variables related to the outcome of interest . Our methods are designed to rely on as few assumptions as possible on nuisance parameters so that they provide maximally objective statistical inference and testing procedures . To develop and refine these methods , we work with simulated and real data in collaboration with biologists , medical researchers , epidemiologists , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I study systematic constraints and random influences that shape the structure of human populations . I helped develop methods of computer simulation to understand the rarity of coresident family members in pre-industrial English households . With these methods , I am now forecasting the kin and family support available to new generations of elderly in the Twentyfirst century . Working in " non-linear " demography , I have identified mechanisms that give rise to specific kinds of cycles in fertility and population growth . I am currently interested in patterns of mortality at extreme ages shared between humans and other species , trying to reconcile them with statistical models for long-term processes of evolutionary change . <p> In broad terms , I am interested in problems at the interface between computation and statistics . Part of my research focuses on algorithms and Markov random fields , a class of probabilistic model based on graphs used to capture dependencies in multivariate data ( e.g. , image models , data compression , computational biology ) . In general , exact solutions to inference problems in such models are computationally intractable , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ methods for statistical inference . I am also interested in studying the effect of decentralization and communication constraints in statistical inference problems . A final area of interest is methodology and theory for high-dimensional inference problems , in which the model dimension is of the same order ( or larger than ) the sample size . <p> I am currently working on statistical methodologies and models involving large data sets from remote sensing , data networks ( internet and sensor networks ) , neuroscience , finance , and bioinformatics . Together with my students and collaborators , I have been working on different areas of statistical machine learning , theoretical and computational . These areas include boosting , Lasso , support vector machines ( SVM ) , and semi-supervised learning . On the computational side , we have developed algorithms such as BLasso and iCAP for sparse modeling . My past research areas have also included empirical processes , Markov Chain Monte Carlo , signal processing , the minimum description length principle ( MDL ) , and information theory .

@@11574841 @174841/ <p> There is an ongoing debate over whether impaired fertility is connected to the effects of environmental factors . Chronic exposure to organic compounds such as bisphenol A ( BPA ) and phthalates is emerging as a possible cause of reduced fertility and spontaneous pregnancy termination . BPA is present in food and beverage containers , and its evaporation increases with age and usage of the product . As a xenoestrogen , BPA has been shown to cause genetic damage in mouse oocytes , leading to miscarriage and infertility . Phthalates are used as plasticizers in polyvinylchloride ( PVC ) products and therefore are constituents of food packaging , coatings of pills , catheters , and blood transfusion tubes . Because phthalates do not bind covalently to PVC , they easily leach into the environment and are taken up via ingestion , inhalation , skin absorption , or intravenous medication . In mice , chronic exposure to phthalates also increases embryo loss and fetal malformation . Moreover , according to our preliminary data , phthalate components of plastic tubing used for hemodialysis impair human sperm motility and intracellular calcium @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and impaired fertility by studying the effects these compounds have on human sperm function , in particular in patients undergoing dialysis treatment .

Image courtesy of Krishna Niyogi . <p> Photosynthesis is the process in which plants turn light energy and carbon dioxide into food and fuel . In full sun , plants receive more energy than they can use . The extra energy could generate damaging molecules , but instead , plants siphon this energy off as heat to protect themselves . When a cloud passes overhead , plants are slow to recover from this protective process , which is called non-photochemical quenching , or NPQ . <p> In a recent study , researchers used a rapid screening technique that genetically engineers plants--in real time--to investigate how to help plants realize their full potential during this process . <p> " It can take minutes to hours for the plant to fully recover and begin photosynthesizing at maximum capacity again , " said- Krishna Niyogi , a professor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) and one of the authors of the study . " We are trying to figure out how to speed up the plant 's recovery from NPQ , which models predict could increase yields by 10 to 15 percent . " <p> Niyogi and co-authors are searching for mechanisms that plants and algae naturally evolved to recover faster from NPQ . Their study was published in- Plant Journal- and is part of Realizing Increased Photosynthetic Efficiency(RIPE) , a multi-institutional research project funded by the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation and led by the University of Illinois at the Carl R. Woese Institute for Genomic Biology . <p> " The method developed here will greatly accelerate the search for means to improve photosynthetic efficiency under conditions of varying light , " said said RIPE Director- Steve Long , Gutgsell Endowed Professor of Plant Biology and Crop Sciences at Illinois . <p> Before implementing this technique , researchers could quickly sequence the DNA of these organisms , but lacked the biological tools to quickly figure out the genes responsible for desirable traits .

With transient expression , the gene is expressed for a few days and then the effect on the leaf is tested . <p> Researchers swap out the genes from a bacterium that , in nature , produce tumorous growths on the roots of flowering plants with the genes that might speed recovery from NPQ . <p> NPQ is incredibly complex . At least four different mechanisms , with different rates of recovery , collectively make up NPQ . The fastest mechanism is mediated by a tug-of-war between two enzymes. - <p> In this study , researchers evaluated how overexpressing these enzymes affected NPQ .

This host shutoff phenotype is orchestrated by the viral SOX protein , yet its functional significance to the viral lifecycle has not been elucidated , in part due to the multifunctional nature of SOX . Using an unbiased mutagenesis screen of the murine gammaherpesvirus 68 ( MHV68 ) SOX homolog , we isolated a single amino acid point mutant that is selectively defective in host shutoff activity . Incorporation of this mutation into MHV68 yielded a virus with significantly reduced capacity for mRNA turnover . Unexpectedly , the MHV68 mutant showed little defect during the acute replication phase in the mouse lung . Instead , the virus exhibited attenuation at later stages of in vivo infections suggestive of defects in both trafficking and latency establishment .

We initiate the analysis of the multi-dimensional SE dynamics by proving their convergence to a fixed point , along with some further properties of the iterates .

@@11574937 @174937/ <h> Profile : Interstellar <p> Personal background <p> 46 year old born in Romania and naturalized in USA since 1990 . Graduated from the Faculty of Building Services and Equipment . I work as a system engineer : audio , video , intercom , phones and signal processing/data communications and information security systems.Hobbies : Web Design , programming in Visual Basic , CISCO Networking , Space Science and Finances . Prefered Genius:Einstein . Prefered scientists:Carl Sagan and Stephen Hawking . Prefered music bands : Pink Floyd ( Roger Waters ) &amp; Phoenix . <p> Thoughts about SETI and SETI@home <p> 1 . Why do you run SETI@home ? <p> I want to contribute to a Brilliant idea put in practice by brilliant minds seeking to find out on who+-+-+s side of the radio signal the intelligence is.I can not find a better project to use my CPU Time when I+-+-+m sleeping . And the machine is dumb enough to do what is told to do ! 2 . What are your views about the project ? We assume we are not alone . If that is true what are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equal in this Universe , we will make contact ? The current SETI project only scans a few frequencies of radio and TV emissions sent by a Type 0 civilization , but perhaps not an advanced civilization.Because of the enormous static found in deep space , broadcasting on a single frequency presents a serious source of error . Instead of putting all your eggs in one basket , a more efficient system is to break up the message and smear it out over all frequencies ( Fourier like transform ) and then reassemble the signal only at the other end . In this way , even if certain frequencies are disrupted by static , enough of the message will survive to accurately reassemble the message via error correction routines . However , any Type 0 civilization listening in on the message on one frequency band would only hear nonsense . If E.T evolved in the same time scale with us we will not make it : Milky Way is " only " 100,000 light years in diameter and we sent radio wave signals in the last 80 yrs.Our waves went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time for a come back response.It would take any sort of electromagnetic signal that we transmitted 70,000 years to reach the most distant parts of the galaxy . In order for an E.T civilization to detect our transmission , their instruments must be looking in our direction at the time our signal arrives ( and of course they must have chosen the right instrument ) . The chances of that happening are zero , unless we commit to transmitting for a long time . Then when they do get around to searching in the right way , our signal will be there and they will succeed . For us to realize that they have succeeded , they will have to transmit a reply back to us , and that could take another 70,000 years to arrive ! Listening could succeed tomorrow , but transmission is a long-term strategy . For us not enough time , we do a pretty good job trashing our planet.Only hope for us is to evolve in Type I civilization ... If there is detectable technology out there , it is statistically improbable that their evolution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ current emerging technological capabilities . They will be older , potentially billions of years older since the Milky Way Galaxy was around for at least five billion years before our solar system began to form and we are a hundred-year-old technology in a ten billion-year-old galaxy . So SETI I believe can NOT intercept such an artificial signal.In other words , our galaxy could be teeming with messages from various Type II and III civilizations , but our Type 0 radio telescopes would only hear gibberish . I do believe in possibility of ET , and advanced civilization type II , III but I do not believe +-+-+they+-+-+ are interested to contact us , ( nor visited us , their energy output is beyond Earth resurses ) because those advanced civilizations already may have established a galactic protocol for information interchange , to which Earth will have no chance of adhering.But so far SETI is an intelligent project to try our evolution , at least we understood is our job to listen to the sky and evolve to the next level.Transmitting is a harder job than listening , and so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Of course if there are no older technologies , then our searches will not succeed . <p> In the future we may decide that we are indeed the first , that we will have to figure out how to survive to a ripe-old cosmic age , and that we have a responsibility to transmit for the benefit of technological civilizations yet to emerge.First we have to evolve to Type I and escape from the sad brink of our demise.Currently , our energy output qualifies us for Type 0 status . We derive our energy not from harnessing global forces , but from Earth sources.But already , we can see the seeds of a Type I civilization . We see the beginning of a planetary language ( English ) , a planetary communication system ( the Internet ) , a planetary economy ( the forging of the European Union ) , and even the beginnings of a planetary culture ( via mass media , TV , rock music , and Hollywood films ) . <p> By definition , an advanced civilization must grow faster than the frequency of life-threatening catastrophes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every few thousand years , a Type I civilization must master space travel to deflect space debris within that time frame , which should not be much of a problem . Ice ages may take place on a time scale of tens of thousands of years , so a Type I civilization must learn to modify the weather within that time frame . 3 . Any suggestions ? Patience , patience , patience ...

@@11574941 @174941/ <p> In a time when the fertility business in the U.S. is booming and so much is possible " artificial insemination , in vitro fertilization ( IVF ) , surrogacy , and potentially , bioengineering of embryos " there are few , if any , laws that protect the children from these less traditional origins . <p> Babies of Technology : Assisted Reproduction and the Rights of the Child , - by Mary Ann Mason , was published in April 2017 . <p> But there should be , says Mary Ann Mason , a professor of the graduate school at UC Berkeley and a faculty affiliate of the Berkeley Center for Law and Technology . She advocates for strict regulation of the multibillion-dollar fertility industry in her new book Babies of Technology : Assisted Reproduction and the Rights of the Child . <p> Berkeley News spoke with Mason about the state of assisted reproduction in the U.S. and how it needs to change . <p> What rights do you believe children born through assisted reproduction should have ? <p> Mary Ann Mason : All children have a right to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come from . We are our genes . There is a great need to know where you come from . It 's considered a human right in the U.S. and a children 's right in the U.N . In 1989 , there was a U.N . conference on the rights of a child . All the countries came to the conference , including the U.S. , and we signed the treaties . But we 're the only country that did n't ratify it because we did n't believe in children 's rights . <p> Mary Ann Mason- is a professor of the graduate school and- a faculty affiliate of the Berkeley Center for Law and Technology . <p> What are some of the hardships that these kids face ? <p> Right now in the U.S. , sperm donors are promised anonymity . They can give hundreds of- donations , so they could have a lot of kids out there who do n't know who their biological father is . Also , when children do know who the sperm donors are , perhaps because it was a friend or family member @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Supreme Court case where a Florida man who had testicular cancer froze his sperm and his wife had a set of twins with his sperm after he died . The children born after he had died were n't considered to be survivors , so they did n't qualify to receive Social Security benefits . <p> If you have too many embryos implanted , the chances are high of having multiple children with a low birth weight . The mortality and disability associated with low birth weight are prevalent in IVF . In Europe , they limit the number of implantations . Europe is better regulated on all fronts . <p> Then , we have the prospect of the gene-edited baby . It 's not all bad . It means you can edit out terrible diseases . But it does change the human species when you gene edit . And I think the temptation will be once you get rid of bad diseases , you can change height , intelligence , looks , all kinds of things . <p> Why is California considered a prime destination for fertility tourism ? <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the people who sign the contract . The surrogate mom does n't have many rights . States have different laws . People from across the world , especially Asia , will find a surrogate in California , so their baby is born in the state and a California citizen . It 's a great advantage to them . <p> The first baby born using IVF was Louise Brown in 1978 . ( Photo by Maurizio De Angelis via Flickr ) <p> What do you propose ? <p> The U.S. should create a federal administrative agency that would control all aspects of reproduction , instituting guidelines and maintaining records of all procedures performed across the country . Sperm and egg donors should n't be promised anonymity , and the donors should n't be paid . They already have it in England . <p> What is your ultimate stance on assisted reproduction in the fast-moving technological age ? <p> We 're not going to get rid of assisted reproduction . We just need strict rules . We 've already had one child born using the DNA from three parents . The door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has to be controlled with regulations that are pro-child . The constitution says a citizen is a person born here . Those are the people we really want to protect . We , as a country , need to take children 's rights seriously . <p> For nearly three decades , Mason has brought her expertise on children 's rights , child custody issues and family law and policy to UC Berkeley , first as a professor in the Graduate School of Social Welfare and currently as a faculty affiliate of the Berkeley Center for Law &amp; Technology .
