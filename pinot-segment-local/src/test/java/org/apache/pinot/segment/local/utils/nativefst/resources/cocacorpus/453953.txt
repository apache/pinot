@@105680476 @1080476/ <h> EMU Traditions <p> Since the 1991 season , Eastern Michigan University athletic teams have gone by the nickname " Eagles . " <p> The Eagles name was officially adopted on May 22 , 1991 , when the EMU Board of Regents voted to replace the existing Huron nickname and logo with the new one . <p> EMU originally went by the nicknames " Normalites " and " Men from Ypsi " and various other titles down through the years before " Hurons " was adopted in 1929 . <p> The " Hurons " first came into being as the result of a contest sponsored by the Men 's Union in 1929 . On Oct. 31 of that year , a three-person committee , composed of Dr. Clyde Ford , Dr. Elmer Lyman and Professor Bert Peet , selected the name " Hurons " from the many entries in the contest . <p> The name was submitted by two students , Gretchen Borst and George Hanner . Hanner was working at the Huron Hotel at the time of the contest and was no doubt as much influenced by his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The runner-up name in that contest was Pioneers . <p> EMU began investigating the appropriateness of its Huron Indian logo after the Michigan Department of Civil Rights issued a report in October 1988 suggesting that all schools using such logos drop them . The report indicated that the use of Native American names , logos and mascots for athletic teams promoted racial stereotypes . At that time , four colleges , 62 high schools and 33 junior high/middle schools in Michigan used Indian logos or names . <p> The EMU Board of Regents voted to replace the Huron name with Eagles , taken from three recommendations from a committee charged with supplying a new nickname . The other two final names submitted were Green Hornets and Express . <p> Green , White and Yellow ? <p> The EMU Eagles ' colors are green and white , but the track and cross country teams both feature yellow on their uniforms . There is a reason these teams stand out , and the history behind it goes back to 1967 . EMU Hall of Fame Head Coach Bob Parks offered some insight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " When I got to EMU in January 1967 , the team was wearing dark green singlets and dark green shorts . In that season , we ran a meet at Western Michigan University , and the finish line was beneath the balcony which was very dark . In the hurdle final , there were six men , three from Michigan State and three from EMU . MSU 's uniforms were almost identical to ours . When the finish positions were announced , we got the short end of the stick . You could hardly see the runners under the dark balcony area , and they got the finish wrong . At that point , I decided to get uniforms that showed up better . <p> " Back then , Kansas was a big name in collegiate track , and they wore pink shorts and powder blue singlets with pink lettering . Everyone thought they were great . I decided to copy them and ordered orange shorts and green singlets with white lettering trimmed in orange . We wore them for about four years , but the Regents decided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white . When they made us get rid of the orange and green , I ordered green and gold , colors I had always liked . At first , they were n't going to let us use them , but I pointed out that our football team was wearing green and gold . Our administration could hardly argue with me , since our gridders were wearing it too . " <p> " We have worn it ever since , and it is known from coast to coast , as our men have done traditionally well nationally . It also differentiates us from MSU and Ohio University 's color schemes . The green and gold does show up well at the finish line , but nowadays they use computer cameras , so it is less of a problem as it was in the 60s and 70s .
