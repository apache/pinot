@@21945125 @1945125/ <p> WASHINGTON As a senator , Barack Obama once offered measured praise for the border control legislation that would become the basis for one of Donald Trumps first acts as president . <p> " The bill before us will certainly do some good , " Obama said on the Senate floor in October 2006 . He praised the legislation , saying it would provide " better fences and better security along our borders " and would " help stem some of the tide of illegal immigration in this country . " <p> Obama was talking about the Secure Fence Act of 2006 , legislation authorizing a barrier along the southern border passed into law with the support of 26 Democratic senators including party leaders like Hillary Clinton , Joe Biden , and Chuck Schumer . <p> Now its become the legal mechanism for Trump to order construction of a wall between the United States and Mexico , attempting tomake good on a key promise from the campaign trail . Trump specifically cited the law in the first sentence of Wednesdays of Joshua Miller . <p> The episode shows how concerns over border security occupied Washington well before Trump made it the centerpiece of his candidacy , and that Democrats were more than willing to offer big sums of taxpayer money to keep Mexicans and other Latino immigrants out of the United States . The border fence called for in the 2006 law was far less ambitious than the wall Trump envisions , and , as he is apt to do , he has made the issue bigger , more explosive , and far more disruptive to US diplomacy . <p> Trump has also added his own twist that was never a part of the 2006 legislation , a promise that the Mexican people would pay for the wall . But on Thursday White House spokesman Sean Spicer , in a briefing aboard Air Force One , said that Trump would levy a 20 percent tax on all imports from Mexico to fund construction of the barrier . <p> He estimated that the 20 percent tariff would bring in $10 billion a year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the White House appeared to back away from the idea of an import tax . <p> Even before the highly controversial proposed funding mechanism was made public Thursday afternoon , Mexican President Enrique Pea Nieto announced that he was canceling his planned trip to the United States next week , citing the new administrations focus on the wall . <p> Marco Ugarte/Associated Press <p> Mexicos President Enrique Pena Nieto . <p> Former Mexican president Vicente Fox , who opposed the measure in 2006 when he was in office , had even harsher words for Trump . " Donald , do n't  be self-indulgent , " he posted on his Twitter feed Thursday . " Mexico has spoken , we will never ever pay for the #ExpletiveWall . " <p> For Democrats who generally support relaxed rules that offer a path to citizenship for immigrants , the 2006 law was seen as the better of two evils . The House had recently passed legislation immigration advocates viewed as draconian because it would make any undocumented immigrant a felon . <p> By comparison , the border fence did n't  seem so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after a wider overhaul had stalled . <p> " It did n't  have anywhere near the gravity of harm , " recalled Angela Kelley , who in 2006 was the legislative director for the National Immigration Forum . " It was hard to vote against it because who is going to vote against a secure fence ? And it was benign compared with what was out there . " <p> The law flew through the Senate with a vote of 80 to 19 . ( One senator , Edward Kennedy of Massachusetts , was not present . John Kerry , the states other senator , voted against it . ) In the House , the measure passed 283 to 138 , with 64 Democrats supporting it . ( The Massachusetts delegation was split . ) From there it went to then-President George W. Bush , who signed it 12 days before the 2006 mid-term elections . <p> The number of illegal immigrants in the United States reached about 12 million in 2007 , and has since dropped off . <p> The plan was not nearly as expansive as Trumps promise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for about 700 miles of fencing along certain stretches . Congress put aside $1.4 billion for the fence , but the whole cost , including maintenance , was pegged at $50 billion over 25 years , according to analyses at the time . <p> The government had constructed about 650 miles of fence by 2015 , most of it after passage of the act , according to a report last year by the US Government Accountability Office . <p> In his 2006 floor speech , Obama nodded to the prevailing belief in Washington that the bill was n't going anywhere . " This bill , from my perspective , is an election-year , political solution , " he said . " It is great for sound bites and ad campaigns . " <p> Clinton also voted for the bill , though in a floor speech during the debate she completely ignored the fence issue and heaped praise on an amendment to it that would help New York farmers by expanding the number of visas allowed for agricultural workers . <p> During her recent failed presidential campaign , however , she referred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when I was a senator to spend money to build a barrier to try to prevent illegal immigrants from coming in , " Clinton said at November 2015 town hall in New Hampshire , " and I do think that you have to control your borders . " <p> Immigration reform advocates who worked on the bill and opposed it remembered thinking the fence would never actually be built . <p> " There was a lot of analysis done that said you just cant do it , " said Kelley , who worked on the bill and is now the Executive Director of Center for American Progress Action Fund . " It was more a political statement than a sound policy proposal . " <p> " A lot of people owned land where the fence would go . There were endangered squirrels . None of that was being dealt with . It really did feel like this was more of a slogan than a solution , " said Kelley . <p> Only one current Democratic leader voted against the bill : Thats Bernie Sanders , who was in the House @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a statement about it one way or the other , and his spokesman , Michael Briggs , declined to comment Thursday . <p> Leading the opposition in the Senate was Kennedy , though he was not present for the final vote . <p> From the floor he bemoaned the death of a larger bipartisan overhaul to the immigration system and mocked the Republicans for coming up with legislation he felt would do little to fix the problem . <p> " Republican leaders wasted time , opportunity , and your money , " Kennedy said . " For a $9 billion fence that wont do the job . That is just a bumper sticker solution for a complex problem . Its a feel-good plan that will have little effect in the real world . " <p> But outside the halls of Congress , constituents took the legislation very seriously . <p> Republicans held a series of field hearings about the fence around the country , stirring up support for it . <p> Advocates jammed the phone lines , and even sent members of Congress bricks that were intended to symbolize the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a Washington Post story from the time . <p> They were led by a senator who did always argue for the wall : Jeff Sessions , whom Trump has selected to be the attorney general . <p> " We do not have operational control of the border , " Sessions said during the 2006 debate . " Fencing on the southern border is and should be a part of our plan to recapture a legal system of immigration in America . It remains one of our important priorities .

Lots of fresh caught seafood going out and tons of seafood coming in from overseas , its a swap that plays out across the United States , according to Jennifer Dianto Kemmerly Bio . Shes director of Seafood Watch at the Monterey Bay Aquarium . They track and rank environmentally responsible fisheries . <p> JENNIFER DIANTO KEMMERLY , Monterey Bay Aquarium : Over 90 percent of the seafood we consume in the U.S. is actually caught or farm-raised overseas .

@@21945152 @1945152/ <p> Quite a lot , actually , even if we do n't  have a parking pass at CIA headquarters . But there is also a lot of confusion . Call it the " fog of cyberwar . " <p> The fog comes from several sources : <p> Only snippets of information have been disclosed . <p> No public investigations have been held , though some certainly will be . <p> The CIA and FBI seem to have reached different conclusions , and the director of national intelligence has not adjudicated them . <p> Donald Trump has rejected the idea that Russia was trying to help him get elected . And <p> Democrats , seeking to blame anyone but themselves for their losses , have stressed Russias role . Some dead-enders have even said Russian interference invalidates the election results . <p> Its time to clarify what we know so we can figure out what to do next . <p> What Do We Know About Cyber Hacking of the 2016 Election ? <p> First , according to U.S. intelligence agencies , Russia engaged in a widespread cyber campaign directed at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ details , fearing exposure of their " sources and methods , " the crown jewels of all counter-intelligence operations . <p> Second , the heart of Russia 's campaign was collecting secret information , such as private communication among political operatives , and then disclosing that material selectively . They may also have tried to hack election databases in several states . It is unclear if they actually sought to manipulate votes , but , if they did , they had little success . There is zero evidence they changed any vote counts . <p> The impact of cyber espionage on the 2016 election came through information , not direct manipulation of the results . The information , dribbled out through WikiLeaks , was apparently accurate . The targets never contested any major disclosures as false or fraudulent , though that is certainly a danger in future elections . So far , U.S. spy agencies have not established that the WikiLeaks material came from Russiaor , if they have , they have not shared that nugget . <p> Third , the disclosures all hurt Hillary Clinton , not Donald Trump @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may have been aided by weaker cybersecurity on Clinton 's side . The clear implication is that the hackers favored one candidate , or at least opposed the other . The likely reason is Hillarys tough line on Russia after the failure of the " reset , " plus memories of Bill Clintons expansion of NATO into Eastern Europe in the 1990s . <p> Fourth , although the U.S. intelligence community has determined Russia did the hacking and that it was aimed at Clinton , invesitgators have not reached a consensus on the Kremlin 's ultimate motivation . At the very least , Vladimir Putin and his agents were trying to sow doubts about the integrity of the American election process . At the most , they were trying to pick the winner . <p> They did succeed in sowing doubts . The unending stream of leaks added to Hillarys woes and impeded her flailing efforts to put out a persuasive message . On the other hand , no one doubts that the votes were counted fairly and Trump won . Few , beyond conspiracy theorists , think outside interference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. Do Next ? <p> Even if foreign cyber operations did not flip the outcome , they are unacceptable interference in American elections . What should we do next ? <p> To begin with , we should recognize this attack for what it is : an assault on our shared constitutional foundations , which require fair elections , free from foreign interference . That is not a partisan issue , and it should not become one . That means we need a thorough inquiry into exactly what happened and who did it . And we need that done in ways that transcend partisan divisions . <p> The stakes involve not only the 2016 election , but future ones , not only the U.S. election but those in other democracies . Since Russia , China , Iran , and other nations have stakes in those , they will be tempted to interfere . The tighter the election , the greater the chances cyberattacks could change the outcome -- and throw that country into disarray . One way of raising the costs of such attacks , aside from better cybersecurity and tougher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , disclosed , and punished . <p> A serious investigation should not be an excuse for denying the outcome of the 2016 election or for saying it was rigged by a foreign power . The election is over , and Hillarys loss can not be attributed to Russian interference . <p> If the investigation is to be serious and non-partisan , if it is to develop recommendations for future elections , then it can not be left to Congress . Lawmakers will surely hold hearings , but , if previous hearings are any guide , they will be shallow , backward-looking , and filled with partisan grandstanding . They produce sound bites , not sound conclusions . In any case , the new Congress has a full agenda dealing with health care , tax reform , regulatory changes , executive appointments , a Supreme Court nominee , and more . <p> The best solution is a bipartisan commission . The model is the 9/11 commission , with a lower profile . It should have subpoena power and cooperate closely with intelligence agencies in the U.S. and abroad .

@@21945156 @1945156/ <p> Texas health officials announced on Tuesday that the state would revoke Planned Parenthoods Medicaid funding . Planned Parenthood affiliates in Texas received about $3.1 million in Medicaid funds last year , which helped to fund non-abortive health care services for low-income men and women . ( Public funds may not be used to finance abortions . ) Now , however , the Texas Health and Human Services Commissionthe same agency that required women to bury or cremate aborted or miscarried fetuseshas informed the organization that its funding will cease in 30 days . <p> As Texas must surely understand , this attempt to defund Planned Parenthood directly contravenes federal law . The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuitwhich encompasses Texashas already ruled that states may not defund Planned Parenthood because some affiliate clinics provide abortion services . Medicaids " free choice of provider " requirement permits patients to receive medical care from any facility that is " qualified to perform the service or services required . " States may set " reasonable standards relating to the qualifications of providers , " but these standards must relate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legal care . A political disagreement with the facilitys affiliates , like opposition to abortion , simply is n't relevant to a providers " qualifications . " <p> Advertisement <p> Texas cites the notorious smear videos against Planned Parenthood as proof that the organization is not " qualified to provide medical services in a professionally competent , safe , legal and ethical manner . " This claim might hold water if Planned Parenthood actually did what Texas accuses it of doing " deviating from accepted standards " to procure fetal tissue and " charging more than the costs incurred for procuring " the samples . But since those heavily doctored videosdid not actually show Planned Parenthood breaking the law , this argument can not withstand judicial scrutiny . The obvious reality , barely concealed by Texas irate letter , is that the state opposes abortion and does n't  want to let federal health care funds go to organizations that terminate pregnancies . <p> That leads to the second reason why Texas move against Planned Parenthood is illegal : It very likely violates the Constitution . As the 10th Circuit Court of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have ruled , efforts to revoke Planned Parenthoods funding because it provides abortions violates the First Amendment . Under the " unconstitutional conditions " doctrine , the government can not deprive a group of funds because it exercises a fundamental right that the government detests or because it promotes an idea that the government does n't  like . Texas is attempting to rescind Planned Parenthoods funding because the group performs abortionsa fundamental right protected under the 14th Amendmentand advocates for greater abortion access . The state is constitutionally barred from punishing Planned Parenthood for engaging in these activities . <p> Of course , a Republican-dominated Congress could create a Planned Parenthood exception to Medicaids " free choice of provider " requirement , and GOP-dominated courts could uphold such a rule . Moreover , Rep. Tom Price , Donald Trumps anti-abortion nominee for secretary of health and human services , can fairly easily undo the extra safeguards President Barack Obama has instituted to protect Planned Parenthood funding . Abortion rights are gravely imperiled by Trumps presidency , and the legal landscape protecting women from states anti-abortion crusades could change quickly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Parenthood is indisputably unlawful , and it stands essentially no chance of surviving the coming court challenge . <p> Mark Joseph Stern is a writer for Slate .

The result of these calculations could then be multiplied by a specific number of days to determine how much interest would accrue in a specific time frame . <p> Interest adds-up ( accrues ) based on the principal balance of your loans . When this interest remains unpaid , at the end of certain periods , such as when your loan enters repayment , or after a deferment or forbearance ends , it is usually added to the principal balance of the loan when the loan again has payments due ( goes into repayment ) . <p> At that point , any future interest that accrues will be based on the new outstanding principal amount ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you pay interest on interest and capitalization increases the total cost of your loan . <p> You can avoid the cost of capitalization by making payments ( on accruing interest or even on the balance ) during any period when they are not due . <p> Note : The U.S. Department of Education does not assess late or returned payment fees . <p> Late fees : Any payment not received within 15 days of the due date may incur a late fee of up to six cents for each dollar that 's late , as described in the terms of your promissory note .

@@21945174 @1945174/ <h> Commentary By <p> Mollie McNeill is a research assistant with economic and budget policy at The Heritage Foundation . <p> When President-elect Donald Trump enters office on Jan. 20 , he will inherit almost $20 trillion of national debt . This debt is a threat to the American economy , and its key driver " unsustainable spending " must be controlled . <p> Come Jan. 20 , the new administration should act immediately to tame the federal budget and reduce the national debt . Here are three solutions from The Heritage Foundation 's Blueprint Series that do just that . <p> 1 . Reform autopilot entitlement programs . <p> Entitlement programs like Medicare , Medicaid , and Social Security make up the largest portion of the federal budget . In 2015 , major entitlement programs consumed 52 percent of all tax dollars . They will grow to consume even more of the budget unless lawmakers intervene . <p> Currently , entitlement programs run on autopilot , meaning they do n't require new spending bills to keep running . Because of laws put in place years ago , agencies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and it is politically unpopular for politicians to reform or downsize them . <p> The next administration should reform these unsustainable mandatory programs . Some commonsense solutions include repealing and replacing Obamacare , modernizing Medicare , capping the federal allotment for Medicaid , and making reforms to Social Security . <p> Entitlements Devour All Taxes by 2038 <p> 2 . Balance the budget . <p> Persistent budget deficits allow the national debt to spiral out of control . For the last 50 years , the federal budget had an average deficit of 2.8 percent of gross domestic product , and the current Congressional Budget Office baseline projects that deficits will surpass $1 trillion before the end of the decade . <p> Balancing the budget is n't a cure all , since legislators can always use higher taxes to support higher spending and technically balance the budget in the short term . In the long run , higher taxes would end up chasing ever higher spending , which is unsustainable . Instead , a balanced budget is an important goal to prioritize spending and reduce deficits and debt . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is supposed to enable lawmakers to set national priorities in a timely and predictable way . But the current process , established in 1974 , has only worked four times . <p> The current process leads to higher government spending and debt . Since the most expensive programs , like Social Security , Medicare , and Medicaid grow on autopilot , and because they are also the most popular , politicians have little incentive to change them . <p> The next administration must enact budget process reforms that restore accountability and fiscal responsibility to the federal budget . <p> So far , the new administration 's plans for addressing the national debt have n't been great . Trump has proposed renegotiating the national debt and printing more money . Both are possible , but will ultimately prove to be unhelpful and economically dangerous distractions from the out-of-control spending that is driving the national debt . <p> Despite the lack of concrete current plans to control the debt , the next administration will have ample opportunity to tame the federal budget . Trump 's pick for Office of Management and Budget @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ budget hawk who values fiscal conservatism . <p> The Congress is controlled by Republicans who have put forth sensible and realistic proposals to reduce out-of-control health spending with Medicare premium support and caps on federal Medicaid allotments . With the House , Senate , and executive all controlled by the same party , serious budget reform is within reach . <p> The incoming administration needs a plan to get spending and high national debt under control now , to ensure economic freedom and secure prosperity in formats that respect your timeand your intelligence . 
@@21945176 @1945176/ <h> Antibodies and Transplantation : Everything You Wanted to Know and More <h> Carrie A. Schinstock , M.D. <p> Antibodies are important , right ? Our immune system naturally forms antibodies as a protective response against bacteria and viruses . In the context of transplantation , antibodies are good when they are ready to attack foreign invaders that can lead to illness , but antibodies can also be ready to attack foreign tissue " such as a new kidney transplant . For this reason , antibodies towards different tissue types , otherwise known as anti- human leukocyte antigen donor specific antibodies ( anti-HLA DSAs ) , are measured prior to transplantation . Having a high number of different antibodies towards different tissue types could mean that you are at high risk of rejection if you received a transplant from certain kidney donors . If you have antibodies against your particular kidney donor , the crossmatch will likely be positive ( reactive ) meaning that transplantation with that donor would be at high risk for rejection . <p> There are some frequently asked questions ( FAQs ) on the topic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get antibodies ? A : Anti-HLA antibodies are formed by the immune system when you are exposed to proteins that appear similar to tissue types . This most commonly occurs in the setting of previous transplantation , pregnancy , or blood transfusion . Occasionally the cause of anti-HLA antibody formation is not known . Unfortunately once you have anti-HLA antibodies , they do not go away on their own . Antibodies can be difficult to remove from the body , although different treatments have been tried . Antibody levels can temporarily increase in the setting of infection , vaccination , or transplantation . <p> Q : What is a calculated panel reactive antibody or cPRA ? A : After your antibodies are measured , your health care provider can use them to calculate your PRA . The cPRA estimates the percentage of donors with whom a particular recipient would be incompatible . In other words , it would give you an idea of the percentage of offered kidneys your body would likely reject at the time of transplantation . The cPRA is used in the allocation of kidney and pancreas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transplantation because it is harder to find compatible donor organs in those situations . The good news is that most patients awaiting kidney transplantation have low levels of anti-HLA antibodies , but it is estimated that 9,000 patients on the waitlist have cPRA &gt; 95% . <p> Q : What are my options if I have a high cPRA ? A : Although it may take longer to get a transplant if you have high levels of anti-HLA antibodies , do not lose hope . There are many options available for patients with high levels of antibodies . If you have high antibodies , seek out a specialized transplant center to explore these options . <p> Transplant Lingo 101 : A Glossary of Commonly Used TermsNegative cross-match kidney transplantation : Occasionally the levels of antibodies that you have against a particular kidney donor are very low . This results in a negative crossmatch when your blood and the donor white blood cells are mixed . In this scenario , it can be very safe for you to undergo transplantation and your kidney transplant will likely last for a long time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there are many patients with antibodies against their particular donor , pools of incompatible donors and recipients have been formed . Specialized programs and matching systems have been developed to take donors and recipients from these pools in order to create compatible matches . Some of these programs involve specific transplant centers and others are nationally-based . Talk with the staff from your transplant center about their paired donation programs . <p> Positive cross-match kidney transplantation : Occasionally , it is possible to undergo positive cross-match transplantation . In this case , you have antibodies towards your donor , but it is safe to cautiously undergo transplantation at a specialized transplant center with expertise in this particular area . You may need special treatments such as plasmapheresis and/or intravenous immunoglobulin ( IVIG ) to undergo this type of transplant . These are treatments that can remove antibodies . In select situations , positive crossmatch kidney transplantation is a better option than remaining on the deceased donor waiting list .

Transplant centers with specialized interests in positive crossmatch kidney transplantation will usually have details about these clinical trials . <p> Our understanding of anti-HLA donor specific antibody and positive crossmatch kidney transplantation has increased considerably over the last 10 years , and more options are now available to patients with high antibodies than ever before . Researchers continue to work hard to overcome the antibody barriers to successful transplantation . If you have been told you have antibodies , before losing hope that you will never get a transplant , seek consultation with a transplant nephrologist or surgeon who specializes in this area . <p> Date Reviewed : <p> January 20 , 2017 <p> The information shared on our websites is information developed solely from internal experts on the subject matter , including medical advisory boards , who have developed guidelines for our patient content .

Right-to-work laws do more than protect individuals from being required to join a union as a condition of employment . They are a proven catalyst for expanding jobs and opportunities throughout the states . <p> This past weekend , Kentucky became the 27th- state to pass right-to-work legislation " and it 's not hard to see why . <p> It also explains why a dozen Kentucky counties have passed local right-to-work ordinances in recent years . These counties quickly began to outperform the rest of the state . Within six months of passing right-to-work in Warren County , local officials received- inquiries from 47 economic development projects , compared to just 32 inquiries that state officials received in 2014 . <p> Warren 's success is n't unique among right-to-work jurisdictions . <p> Federal data shows that right-to-work states see higher economic and job growth than states without it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have not protected worker freedom . Data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics also reveals that right-to-work states- enjoyed job growth at twice the rate- of non-right-to-work states between 1990 and 2014 . <p> It 's no wonder that 480,000 Americans- moved from non-right-to-work states to right-to-work- states between July 2014 and July 2015 . Of course , people relocate for many reasons , but chief among them is greater opportunity " which is exactly what right-to-work states provide . <p> But in addition to spurring unmatched economic opportunity , right-to-work laws protect workers ' fundamental freedoms . Despite union leaders ' claims that right-to-work laws dismantle unions , such protections empower workers to decide for themselves whether they would prefer to join a union . That way individuals can work wherever they have the best opportunities , regardless of union membership . <p> Right-to-work creates a mutually beneficial environment not only between employee and employer , but also union and member . When union membership is not required , unions will do more to earn workers ' trust and association . <p> Forced union dues can also be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather not fund a specific candidate or policy .

After all , the right to freely associate is enshrined in the First Amendment . These essential worker freedoms , taken together with the economic benefits of instituting worker protections , have spurred four states to pass right-to-work laws in the past five years . <p> Legislators in Missouri and New Hampshire may follow Kentucky 's lead in the coming weeks " and they should if they hope to ignite economic growth . <p> In the case of Missouri , all but one of the state 's eight neighbors have now passed right-to-work legislation , and in November half of them had- lower unemployment rates than Missouri . Both the Missouri and New Hampshire legislatures previously passed right-to-work bills " Missouri in 2015 and New Hampshire in 2011 " but neither was able to overcome their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elected governors who support worker freedom . <p> Other states would be wise to follow suit . American workers in all 50 states should have the freedom to let their skills determine their employment opportunities , not their union membership .

@@21945178 @1945178/ <h> How liberal groups should respond to Trump 's Cabinet picks <p> The next four years may well be a disaster for the environment , for workplace safety rules , for civil rights and liberties , for reproductive rights , and for a wide range of matters that the American left cares about . <p> They will , however , be a bonanza for the bottom lines of the groups that are organized around these issues . <p> Historically , interest groups have benefited from threat , or the perception of threat . It is much easier for groups to raise money when they can credibly claim that they are defending members and supporters against a hostile government . It is easier to do this when groups can personify the threat . The easiest time to do this is when a president is appointing people to positions of power . <p> That is , it 's not just that Trump is a threat to civil liberties , it 's that he has appointed as his chief strategist a fellow with a history of saying , or encouraging others to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not that Trump has unrealistic views about the problems facing African-Americans , it is that he has nominated someone to serve as attorney general who has already been rejected for a federal judgeship for saying openly racist things . <p> Presidents usually do n't want to expend political capital defending one wayward Cabinet secretary , so sooner or later , all of these people were forced by public or congressional pressure to step down . Supreme Court nominations serve as a particularly good moment to focus opposition because they happen outside of the normal political cycle , and groups with differing issue goals can often combine forces to criticize a particular nominee . <p> Even when groups are not successful in derailing appointments or confirmations , these targets ' status as public enemy was good for fundraising . Vice President Dick Cheney , for instance , was surely responsible for raising millions of dollars for Democratic causes . <p> How might this play out in the upcoming months ? Here are a few scenarios : <p> Make an example of people early . It is easier to block the confirmation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who 's already in office . Given that an incoming president tends to face an opposition party in some disarray , an early effort to challenge Cabinet appointees can boost morale and unify opposition . <p> Hold your fire , because you do n't know what 's coming next . Trump 's selection of Steven Bannon is a good example here . The Anti-Defamation League has come out in opposition to Bannon , but other Jewish groups have not . This may be in part because Bannon 's allegedly anti-Semitic views are hard to substantiate ( the statements in question were published on Breitbart News , which Bannon led from 2012 to 2016 , but Bannon himself did not write them ) , and in part because Bannon 's job is not subject to confirmation . <p> Flood the zone . It is entirely possible that there will simply be too many people appointed by Trump who are objectionable to liberals . Ultimately , some unsavory characters may get a free pass simply because it 's hard to target everyone . <p> Ultimately , the problem for liberal groups is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's precious little that these groups can do to stop Trump from appointing whomever he wants . Scoring points early , however , will be vital for these groups , if only to rally their members and prepare for what are certain to be a long four years . <p> Robert G.

What we often do n't  think about , but should , is how having a learning disability may affect children emotionally . <p> Not all kids with a learning disability become frustrated , sad , or anxious , but it is pretty common for kids to go through at least some period of emotional struggle . It is n't easy for children when they see themselves falling behind their peers at school . Even if they pretend that they do n't  notice or care , struggling in school can be a demoralizing experience . Here are some signs that kids might be struggling emotionally : <p> Lowered self-esteem <p> Increased anxiety , particularly in academic situations <p> Increased sadness or irritability <p> Acting out <p> Physical symptoms like headaches or stomach aches <p> Reduced motivation <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be obvious , while others , like acting out , are more frequently misunderstood . Laura Phillips , PsyD , a neuropsychologist at the Child Mind Institute , explains the dynamic . " Sometimes kids would rather be the bad kid than the dumb kid , or theyd rather be the class clown . They 're either trying to divert attention away from their academic struggles or they 're trying to have the I do n't  care attitude as a way of saving face . " <p> In addition to getting kids help for a learning issue " strengthening skills and finding strategies that play to their strengths " parents should think about the emotional needs of a child . If you see signs that your child is struggling , try to understand what specifically is troubling him . Below are the three most common reasons why kids with a learning disability might feel bad , and what to do about them . <h> 1 . Kids think they are " dumb . " <p> This is a particularly big one during the period before a child has received a diagnosis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same pace as the other kids , and can assume it is because they just are n't  smart . Unfortunately kids can keep believing they are n't  smart even after they are diagnosed with a learning disability . <p> What to do : <p> Make sure your child understands what a learning disability is . " Kids might not know , but by definition a learning disability means that a student is of at least average intelligence , " explains Dr. Phillips . In fact a learning disability is identified when an expert recognizes that a child is not performing up to her natural ability in a particular area . Hearing explicitly that a learning disability has nothing to do with intelligence can be very meaningful to kids . <p> Talk it through . Ideally you , your child , and whoever is working with your child should talk about the learning disability together . Sometimes parents think kids wont understand , but a learning expert can help you find developmentally appropriate language to use . <p> Think about the messages you are sending . Children are very sensitive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you are uncomfortable with their diagnosis , or that you think that having a learning disability is a bad thing , they will probably feel the same way . <p> Examine your own feelings . Because learning disabilities in children can be genetic , sometimes seeing a child struggling can also bring back difficult memories for parents , or make them feel guilty . You may want to schedule a separate appointment to discuss any questions or concerns you have with your childs provider . The best way to help your child feel more positive is if you start feeling positive , too . <h> 2 . Kids feel like they stick out in class . <p> The last thing most kids want is to look different from their friends . So when kids get pulled out of class for tutoring or called on by the teacher for something they 're afraid they cant deliver , they may feel embarrassed and singled out . These experiences day after day can damage a childs self-esteem and make her dread going to school . <p> What to do : <p> Ask teachers to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says that she sometimes works with schools to help teachers understand how a particular students learning disability is impacting him emotionally . When a child is very anxious about reading , for example , she has advised teachers to wait for him to raise his hand and offer to read instead of calling on him blindly . If his teacher needs to assess his oral reading because its part of the curriculum , it might be better to do that privately . Students and teachers can also work out a subtle signal the student can use when he needs help or feels himself getting too frustrated . <p> Single kids out for praise , too . Kids who are struggling in school may feel like they are mostly getting negative attention . When teachers make a special effort to give kids positive attention for the things that they are doing right " even little things " it can improve their mood and confidence . Dr. Phillips notes this is also a powerful technique for teachers to use with a child who tends to act out to divert attention . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they stick out because they need more assistance than they are currently getting . Work with the school and your childs provider to consider what his needs are and if they are being met . He may need more accommodations , a different kind of tutoring , or even a change of school . Dr. Phillips notes that there are some specialized schools that offer remedial support in school as part of an individualized curriculum rather than making it a separate after-school activity . These schools may also be better prepared to support each childs specific social , emotional , and behavioral needs . <h> Get our email ? <p> Join our list and be among the first to know when we publish new articles .

It can also lead to waning motivation in school . <p> What to do : <p> Remember that success breeds success . It is important to set kids up for success " not failure " as much as possible . Teachers , therapists , and parents should consciously set modest , achievable goals that children can work towards meeting . When a child sees proof that she is making progress she will be more motivated to continue putting forth that extra effort . <p> Find their talent . This is possibly the most important thing you can do for a child who has a learning disability . You do n't  need to find her " passion , " or the thing she will do for the rest of her life " most kids wo n't end up being professional athletes or ballet dancers " but every child has a talent . Find something that your child feels good about doing , and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give her time to practice it .

@@21945210 @1945210/ <h> Giant sucking sound <p> John McLane guides his dirt-caked crew cab pickup along the dirt and asphalt roads of Osceola Township . A former surveyor who worked for the oil and natural gas industry for 30 years , he knows these back roads well enough to show where they intersect with the marshes , lakes , and streams that lead into the Chippewa and Twin creeks . <p> " See that water down there ? " he says , pointing to a squashed pipe leading into the field . " What 's the flow per minute ? I 've got an idea in my mind . " <p> Case steps down into the " swamp , " which is not all that wet , in fact , and looks at the rust-colored water pooling in front of the pipe . She says it looks like zero flow . In fact , the water is so placid that a bug crawls along a twig that sits under the surface " and then defiantly turns upstream . <p> As Case ambles down to inspect the creek bed , he mock-warns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knock you flat on your ass ! " <p> Looping back across Seven Mile Road , he finds where Twin Creek passes underneath , impounded on the upstream side by a failing weir . He estimates the surface of the water is down a few feet , and points out a stand of cattails that would n't be able to set down roots in what used to be a lake . <p> " This is evidence of a drawdown that they do n't want to admit to , because this has occurred since 2001 , " he says . " That was a lake ! And they 've drawn it down enough where you 're back to the original channel . " <p> For almost three hours , McLane shows off dry escarpments where springs used to flow , and anemic creeks that are too warm and lazy for the brook and brown trout that thrived there 15 years ago . <p> The ruling was probably the most closely watched in the history of the county court , and it was delivered in conversational prose that can be read by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , angler , and outdoorsman , found the damages to the river would include warming harmful to existing species , excess nutrient loads and shrinking channels , and an impaired ability for upstream wetlands to filter water , control erosion and flooding , and provide important habitats for wildlife . <p> One of the researchers who watched the case closely was Mark Luttenton , a professor of biology and associate dean at Grand Valley State University . He points out that while monitoring flow downstream can paint a favorable picture of a groundwater extraction operation , it 's often upstream areas that bear the brunt ecologically . <p> " If we lose large segments of those upstream tributaries , then do we potentially lose the nursery habitat that 's pretty critical to those juvenile trout and other fish species ? " Luttenton says . " And I do n't think the DEQ or DNR ever spoke to that issue . They seemed comfortable looking at kind of the system in total , especially farther downstream , which is where my understanding is they typically do their flow-measurements to determine potential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ partnership with the city of Evart , where we both share in benefit of supplying natural spring water for our Michigan operations , drawing from the talented workforce in the area and enhancing the quality of community life , " he says . <p> Trying to think of something to compare Evart 's water infrastructure to , he finally says , " Big Rapids has four wells , and Big Rapids is 10,000 people with a college . So do you see something odd there ? " <p> That 's hard for professor Luttenton to swallow . " If you calculate out 400 gallons per minute , it 's a lot of water over a year : into the hundreds of millions of gallons per year , " he says . " For me , from a biological standpoint ... I have a difficult time being able to come to that conclusion that there wo n't be any impacts at that point . " <p> " We look at available information , " Milne says . " It 's not just the geology , although in this case it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aquifer pumping test data . ... The aquifer has a higher storage capacity than what the tool had assumed . " <p> And the news that the comment period was about to end might never have been widely publicized if not for an eagle-eyed reporter . <p> That journalist was Garret Ellison of MLive , who jolted the leadership of Michigan Citizens for Water Conservation with the news that the comment period would expire in less than a week . <p> It turns out that the state 's Department of Environmental Quality had chosen to notify the public of the comment period in an obscure departmental calendar not widely read beyond the agency 's staff . <p> It 's the kind of move that rankles the nonprofit 's old attorney Jim Olson . <p> " They get the thing approved for the withdrawal back in January . How come nobody knew about that ? " he says . " Why was n't this public knowledge last fall in 2015 ? Or after the site-specific review in January ? " <p> The volunteer-run nonprofit certainly was n't spoiling for a battle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ million dollars ' worth of legal debt after 12 years . But the optics of publishing a public notice in a mostly internal calendar raised the group 's ire , and they began a feisty campaign to write the department , and to demand extensions on the comment period . <p> Case believes many of the problems with the department date back to when it was separated out from the state 's Department of Natural Resources . Indeed , when you look at the department 's guidelines as posted on a state government web page , they are asked to do the seemingly impossible : To ensure a healthy environment while being " partners in economic development . " <p> " There are all kinds of flaws in that permit , " Case says . " There are land issues that need to be investigated . ... We 're finding all kinds of flaws in the permit itself in terms of facts , the locations of things . " With a hearty laugh , McLane says the application shows water flowing uphill , due to incorrect control data . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and facilities , anticipating that they 're going to get a larger volume of water , " Luttenton says . " Then when they hit a roadblock , they use that financial investment and the potential of losing jobs as leverage to improve their chances of getting larger amounts of water at each of their production sites . " <p> That may not have worked with Root in 2003 , but it 's generally been a tactical advantage to expand your capacity in economically starved mid-Michigan and then claim it 's Traverse City environmentalists who are holding good jobs hostage . <p> In a decade , from 2005 to 2015 , the company has withdrawn an estimated 3.4 billion gallons of water from its well fields . If you were to lay down the 5.2-gallon containers on their sides , they 'd stretch from New York to Los Angeles " almost 70 times . All for a few thousand dollars in application fees . <p> And in light of crisis situations downstate , and even as far as Standing Rock , such takings resonate all the more loudly . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a MDEQ hearing that will take place early next year in Big Rapids . But , like Petoskey , she feels the issue must be discussed more widely . Since the water is held in trust by every Michigander from Luna Pier to Iron Mountain , there should be hearings all over the state , and especially in Flint . <p> " Everybody loves to say that Michigan has this huge untapped unlimited resource of fresh water , " professor Luttenton says . " Yes we have a lot of groundwater , but more and more of it is becoming unusable for human consumption because of the high levels of contaminants . I think it 's a real dangerous assumption to keep thinking we have this unlimited resource and not impose high levels of protection on that resource . " <p> " What does it mean to Michigan 's future in a world water crisis , where world demand is going to exceed supply by about 30 percent in 15 years ? " Olson asks . " We 're headed down a really dangerous slope , and that slope is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stop water going out of the Great Lakes . " <p> For Case and her crew , fighting to protect Michigan 's water is worth it . " Water companies are doing this all over the world . This is not just a Michigan phenomenon .

@@21945216 @1945216/ <h> 3 things we must know in order to stop jihadists <p> The truck attack at a Christmas market in Berlin has cast a lurid spotlight on German authorities . The police apparently knew the suspect , had evidence of his ties to jihadists and believed he posed a threat . <p> Yet 12 people are now dead . Last August , we saw a truck used as a weapon of jihad in Nice , France , so why did n't police prevent this one ? <p> The grim truth is that , at best , the homeland defense model is like an endless game of jihadist Whac-a-Mole.With each new kind of murderous attack , we patch one more gap , harden yet more soft targets " and sometimes we thwart a plot , sometimes not . We will improve , but this approach just can not eliminate the jihadist threat . <p> ADVERTISEMENT <p> Many wonder : Could we ever stop these attacks ? <p> The answer is " yes , " but to do that is going to take a fundamental mind shift . <p> The place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nebulous threat from " terrorists " or " violent extremists , " but a distinct enemy : the Islamic totalitarian movement . We need to properly identify the nature of that enemy , what makes it tick and therefore how to stop it . <p> That 's spelled out in my book " Failing to Confront Islamic Totalitarianism , " but here 's the gist : We need to take seriously three crucial truths that , since 9/11 , have been obscured by layers of misunderstanding and evasion . <p> 1 . The enemy is defined , not primarily by its terrorist means , but by its ideological ends . <p> The jihadists fight to expunge any shred of freedom and secular government . They fight to create a society subjugated under Islamic religious law ( sharia ) wherever they can . <p> True , there are many jihadist factions , they fight amongst themselves and they differ over strategic priorities and tactics . But what unites them is their common goal . And they slaughter infidels and unbelievers in the name of realizing their vision of Islamic totalitarianism . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that the jihadists embrace it . <p> 2 . Jihadists choose to become holy warriors . <p> Jihadists , we 're often told , are products of socioeconomic factors outside their control . <p> None of that fits the data . Many jihadists are educated , middle-class and ordinary . <p> Present-elect Trump has floated another kind of deterministic account . In certain moods , he talks as if someone 's innate cultural background or race makes them a holy warrior ( see , for example , how he hammered on the fact that the Orlando shooter 's parents were Afghans , and his calls for an immigration ban on Muslims ) . <p> That 's false , too . <p> It 's about choosing , and acting on , a set of ideas . Think of John Walker Lindh , who turned away from his Marin County , California , upbringing and joined the ranks of the Taliban . Or , on the flip side , consider Ayaan Hirsi Ali , who grew up in a culture saturated with Islamist ideas , but has become a valiant champion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretending that becoming a jihadist somehow happens to people . Catching the flu happens to you . Becoming a jihadist , a self-styled soldier of Allah , is something you make happen . <p> What these fighters choose to embrace is a ( perverse ) ideological vision . Until we realize that , we wo n't be able to fight them effectively . <p> 3 . To defeat the enemy , focus on its crucial state-sponsors . <p> For decades , the jihadist cause has been inspired , nurtured and funded by patrons such as Saudi Arabia , the Gulf states and , above all , Iran. - They are the movement 's sine qua non . <p> The movement 's foundational group , the Muslim Brotherhood , started out in Egypt in the 1920s , but accomplished little . What supercharged the jihadist cause was the 1979 Iranian Revolution . That shockwave brought to power in Tehran an Islamic totalitarian regime committed to exporting its ideological revolution . <p> Iran armed , trained , and funded Lebanese Hezbollah , Palestinian Hamas and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad . It has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Saudi regime has invested millions of dollars setting up religious schools , distributing books and proselytizing across the globe for its preferred strain of Islamic totalitarianism . Saudi money funds various jihadist groups , including the Taliban . And the Gulf states have bankrolled their favored jihadist factions . <p> Absent the inspiration and material backing of its state sponsors ; the galvanizing spectacle of real-life , functioning Islamist regimes in Iran Afghanistan , the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria ( ISIS ) , and elsewhere ; the jihadist cause would have amounted to little more than a bunch of seething pamphleteers and failed revolutionaries . <p> Such regimes make the ideal actuating the jihadists appear righteous , potent and practical . <p> Confronting these state sponsors is key to defeating the jihadist cause . We need more than the Whac-a-Moleapproach to the jihad ; fundamentally , we must demoralize the movement . <p> Once we recognize that jihadists choose their ideology " that that they 're not pushed onto that path by innate or outside forces beyond their control " we can take that choice away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's crucial to demonstrate that their totalitarian vision is unrealizable , that their cause is doomed . An indispensable step is to focus our full diplomatic and military resources on the movement 's inspiration and patrons , including ISIS , but chiefly Saudi Arabia and Iran . <p> Islamic totalitarianism will wither only when our enemies are convinced the West is willing to defend itself with overwhelming force and unflagging commitment . But to do so , we must first understand the enemy .

Ahead of next year 's legislative session , supporters are hopeful momentum is finally on their side . <p> As of October , fewer than 63,000 Texans less than 1 percent of the state 's population were enrolled in the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families ( TANF ) program that provides cash assistance for families struggling to pay for housing , food or utilities . Among the beneficiaries , 54,247 are children . <p> While the Lone Star State already has some of the strictest eligibility requirements in the country , Republican lawmakers have been determined to take advantage of a federal provision that would allow them to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " If you 're going through this difficult period economically or with job prospects , why in the world are you using controlled substances ? " said John Colyandro , executive director of the Texas Conservative Coalition Research Institute , which has long pushed for such a measure . " You 're finding financial wherewithal to be spent on illicit drugs that ought to be used for support of your family . That alone creates an imperative to do a screening and testing . " <p> States including Alabama , Arkansas , Georgia , Kansas , Michigan , Mississippi , Oklahoma , North Carolina and West Virginia already have some form of screenings and drug testing requirements for TANF applicants , according to the National Conference of State Legislatures . But critics have long called such proposals a waste of limited resources that unfairly singles out poor people . <p> Florida had a law that required urine tests for all TANF applicants , but federal courts threw it out in 2014 , citing that it was an invasion of privacy . <p> Rebecca Robertson , legal and policy director for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state could better spend its money on increasing access to drug counseling programs . <p> " TANF only goes to a very small number of Texans , and those are the neediest people in our state , " Robertson said . " There 's this misperception we have this large class of people taking advantage of the benefit to support drug habits , and that 's not the case . " <p> Among the 12 attempts made by the Legislature in recent years , Senate Finance Chair Jane Nelson , R-Flower Mound , has seen her efforts go farthest , according to records from the Texas Legislative Reference Library . Nelsons previous bills passed the Senate during the 2013 session . Her latest effort in 2015 did not get through the Health and Human Services Committee . Neither efforts made it through the House . <p> Nelson filed her latest bill , SB 268 , on Dec. 5 . If it becomes law , TANF applicants would have to undergo a drug screening and only undergo testing if they 're considered at-risk or suspected of drug use . Adult applicants with a felony @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would face mandatory testing . <p> " Drug abuse destroys families , harms children and prevents individuals from living healthy , independent lives , " Nelson said in an email statement . " Because TANF is a direct cash assistance program , we have a responsibility to ensure that these funds are not being used to support a persons drug habit . More importantly , we should have policies that are discouraging drug abuse rather than enabling it . " <p> Nelsons legislation would disqualify applicants who fail their drug tests from TANF for six months . Another failure after that would mean being disqualified from benefits for a year . They would only be allowed to reapply after six months after having enrolled or completed substance abuse counseling . A third failed drug test would ban them permanently . <p> To avoid punishing children of TANF recipients for a parent 's drug use , the bill allows an applicants family to stillreceive benefits through a so-called protective payee who would accept the cash assistance . Nelsons office says her bill is modeled after Michigan 's law . <p> Rep. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bill , HB 436 . His office did not return comment by time of publication . This will be his third attempt with this type of legislation . <p> Nelson 's and Kings bills would give positive drug testers information on substance abuse programs in their area , but the legislation does not include funds that would help pay for those programs . <p> Making a change like this to a program like TANF can take multiple sessions for a Legislature to pass , said Colyandro , who added that the legislation for the upcoming session better weeds out applicants who may have medical prescriptions for certain drugs versus others who use cocaine or methamphetamine . The drug screening , he said , helps make " the administering of the program more fair to the beneficiary and more defensible from a state position . " <p> But Robertson pointed out that the Texas proposal would use TANF funding to help pay for the drug tests . <p> " Thats money that ca n't be used by parents to support kids , " she said . <p> Heather Hahn , a senior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Population at the Washington , D.C.-based Urban Institute , said Texas legislators will need to consider how to implement this requirement in a practical and appropriate way , particularly since other states have spent lots of money on testing only to uncover little drug use . <p> Hahn said welfare office workers in Texas would likely need training to understand what they should look for but warned that that could feed into larger issues such as racial bias . She said people of color applying for welfare benefits often report feeling demeaned or suspect prejudice when asking for help . <p> " Its good that in this law that they 're doing a screener first and not straight to drug testing , " Hahn said . " First of all , its expensive to test everybody , so its good to do a screener first , and then I see in Texas proposal that the state would pay for the test . That 's another issue that 's been a challenge in other states , is the cost of the test for people who are already poor .

For many , many , many years healthcare was a function of a relationship between a provider and the patient . It was not until government got involved that prices began to skyrocket . This is an indisputable fact that anywhere government sticks its nose , services become more expensive .

Even then , there are a few bumps you might hit along the way . Read on for the three most common issues we see when completing ownership transfers . <p> Answer : When filling out the buyer 's line of the AQHA transfer report , your name must read exactly as it does on your AQHA membership card . If what you wrote does n't match anything in our records , we think it 's a newowner and therefore create " and bill for " a new membership for that person . To correct this issue , AQHA requires a signed statement if the I 'd number was not included @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ AQHA Customer Service for that information . <p> Question : I made a mistake on my transfer , marked through it and corrected it . Why am I being asked for verification ? <p> Answer : Information such as the date of sale and the buyer 's name can affect several things outside of the transfer . AQHA uses these dates to determine things such as stallion breeding reports , foal registration documentation and foal ownership . Alterations to the date of sale and the buyer 's name will always require verification from both the buyer and seller . This is one way AQHA prevents fraud . If I got your transfer , marked out your name and put mine in place , and AQHA did n't check out the situation , that horse would belong to me on AQHA 's record . <p> Question : The person I bought the horse from is not the last person listed as the owner according to AQHA records ? <p> Answer : - Since AQHA needs to make sure our records are as accurate as possible , we do not knowingly skip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ penalty as to when a transfer should be submitted to AQHA , nor do we charge any type of additional fees , only one $20 transfer fee will be required .

This process is necessary to maintain a stable balance of body chemicals . <p> The critical regulation of the body 's salt , potassium and acid content is performed by the kidneys . The kidneys also produce hormones that affect the function of other organs . For example , a hormone produced by the kidneys stimulates red blood cell production . Other hormones produced by the kidneys help regulate blood pressure and control calcium metabolism . <p> The kidneys are powerful chemical factories that perform the following functions : <p> remove waste products from the body <p> remove drugs from the body <p> balance the body 's fluids <p> release hormones that regulate blood pressure <p> produce an active form of vitamin D that promotes strong , healthy bones <p> control the production of red blood cells <p> Below you will find more information about the kidneys and the vital role they play in keeping your body functioning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ size of a fist , located on either side of the spine at the lowest level of the rib cage . Each kidney contains up to a million functioning units called nephrons . A nephron consists of a filtering unit of tiny blood vessels called a glomerulus attached to a tubule . When blood enters the glomerulus , it is filtered and the remaining fluid then passes along the tubule . In the tubule , chemicals and water are either added to or removed from this filtered fluid according to the body 's needs , the final product being the urine we excrete . <p> The kidneys perform their life-sustaining job of filtering and returning to the bloodstream about 200 quarts of fluid every 24 hours . About two quarts are removed from the body in the form of urine , and about 198 quarts are recovered .

Some kidney conditions are inherited ( run in families ) . <p> Others are congenital ; that is , individuals may be born with an abnormality that can affect their kidneys . The following are some of the most common types and causes of kidney damage . <p> Diabetes is a disease in which your body does not make enough insulin or can not use normal amounts of insulin properly . This results in a high blood sugar level , which can cause problems in many parts of your body . Diabetes is the leading cause of kidney disease . <p> High blood pressure ( also known as hypertension ) is another common cause of kidney disease and other complications such as heart attacks and strokes . High blood pressure occurs when the force of blood against your artery walls increases .

It is characterized by the formation of kidney cysts that enlarge over time and may cause serious kidney damage and even kidney failure . Other inherited diseases that affect the kidneys include Alport 's Syndrome , primary hyperoxaluria and cystinuria . <p> Kidney stones are very common , and when they pass , they may cause severe pain in your back and side . There are many possible causes of kidney stones , including an inherited disorder that causes too much calcium to be absorbed from foods and urinary tract infections or obstructions .

These usually involve some problem that occurs in the urinary tract when a baby is developing in its mother 's womb . One of the most common occurs when a valve-like mechanism between the bladder and ureter ( urine tube ) fails to work properly and allows urine to back up ( reflux ) to the kidneys , causing infections and possible kidney damage . <p> Drugs and toxins can also cause kidney problems .

Sometimes , chronic kidney disease may progress to kidney failure , requiring dialysis or kidney transplantation .

Life is so precious and beautiful , and instead of making the most out of it , we choose to waste it just because we have been programmed to do so . <p> Habits , tradition and belief systems have turned us into mindless automatons who do n't  enjoy life and just follow a predetermined path that was handed to us by- society . This programming , however , can be broken , if we realize that the way we live is preventing us from- squeezing the juice out of life , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ act . Then , life can be turned into a beautiful celebration filled with laughter , play , and love . <h> How to Deprogram Yourself <p> Below are 10 tips that will help you to deprogram yourself and escape the matrix you 've been trapped into since- the day you were born : <h> 1 . Break free from the shackles- of organized religion <p> Dogmatic , organized religion imposes on people what to think and what not to , what is good and what is bad , what is right and what is wrong . <p> Thus , organized religion- prevents people from using their critical thinking , seeking the truth , and reaching to their own conclusions . On the contrary , it teaches them to blindly follow a set of morals and rules . The result ? Emotional suppression and suffering . <p> If you want to reclaim your individuality , honestly express yourself and walk on the path of understanding , be sure to break- the chains of organized religion and start your own quest- for the truth from scratch . <h> 2 . Stop- giving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ age , most of us were taught to doubt ourselves and do only what authority commands us to , even if we do n't  feel like doing so . Now , as adults , we do n't  trust ourselves , and so we choose to let others have- power over our lives . <p> We vote- for politicians who do nothing but lie to us in order to satisfy their inner hunger , being under the illusion that by voting we are granted the power to choose our future , when in reality the choices we are presented with are very limited and almost exactly the same . So we allow a small group of people to manipulate us for their own personal gain , foolishly believing that they want- to contribute to the betterment of society . <p> If we truly want- to start creating a positive change in the world , we need to stop giving power to a few others and hold them responsible for our lives , and instead start taking- responsibility in our own hands so that we can become the creators of our destiny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Money , in essence , is created out of debt , thus creating the illusion of- scarcity of resources , which compels people- to compete in the market , who have to waste most- of their life working as wage slaves . This- inevitably results in the tremendous suffering and social conflict that prevails all around the world . <p> In addition , our economic system requires people to consume without end so that money can keep on circulating in the- economy , thus urging us to continuously buy things we do n't  need and which are going to end up in landfills , poisoning the very environment- that we depend on and sustains us . <p> If you do n't  like this kind of living and would like to create a positive change in your life and the world , I 'd highly recommend you to research further into the immensely negative consequences of our economy , and educate yourself on alternative , more technically efficient and environmentally sustainable economic systems . <p> Being brought up in a consumer culture , we believe that- money can buy everything we need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ choose to buy more and more things without end , but we always end up feeling dissatisfied and hungry for more stuff . <p> The truth is that money can only provide us with substitutes for what we truly need , but not the real deal . What we need is neither possessions nor services , but things such as love , friendship , and creativity. - So do n't  be concerned about which is the next best thing you can buy , and instead invest your time and efforts in achieving heart-opening and mind-expanding experiences that money cant buy . <h> 5 . Be mindful of what you- put into your body <p> Is what you 're eating contributing to your health or is it poisoning your physical organism ? Is what you 're eating environmentally sustainable , or is it negatively impacting the natural world ? These are some important questions that all people should ask themselves . <p> Most people choose to eat foods which are filled with sugar , preservatives , and which are empty of nutrients or contain animal-derived products , unaware that their food choices are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ death of tens of billions of animals , and have a tremendously- negative impact on the environment . <p> From now on , be sure to choose carefully what you- choose to put into your mouth , and I assure you that this is one of the best things you can do for yourself and the world . <h> 6 . Choose your news sources wisely <p> Knowledge is power , but we are drowning in an ocean- of information . <p> Corporate media presents us all the time with biased information so as to fool us into believing the lies they tell us just so that they can- manipulate us exactly the way they want . <p> A true seeker of knowledge does not accept anything on belief but seeks out for facts and tries to develop- a spherical understanding of the matter he/she is looking into . <p> If you do n't  like being mislead and desire to better understand what 's going on in the world , do your best to collect information from as many sources as possible and use critical thinking in order to reach to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 7 . Read eye-opening , - mind-empowering books <p> There have been plenty of wise individuals whove written down their thoughts on- lifes problems and how they can be overcome . Many- of them- criticized the workings of society and offer their insights on how we can help create a more beautiful world- in the form of books . <p> Books , therefore , can be immensely helpful to open our eyes and- improve the quality of our life , but the sad truth is that not a lot of people spend much of their time reading books- or they just- choose to read for entertainment reasons alone . <p> To get the most out of reading books , be sure to not just pick any book and read it read those ones that touch your mind and heart and provide you with new perspectives that help you to- better understand yourself and the world . <h> 8 . Escape the herd mentality <p> Unfortunately , society has suppressed our individuality since the- day we were born . Weve been programmed to doubt ourselves and conform to what is considered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ embracing ourselves and creating our own path in life , which is causing us immense emotional pain . <p> From today , distance yourself from the herd mentality and start paying attention to your inner voice- doing so- will allow you to follow your calling and live the way you truly want to live . <h> 9. - Creatively express yourself <p> A great way to deprogram yourself from the normalcy of modern life is to focus your attention on creativity . <p> Were all born creative , but slowly slowly our creativity has been suppressed so much that weve almost forgotten that were creative beings . <p> To be creative means to think- outside the box and see life from different perspectives. - Most importantly , to be creative means to find out new ways of living and realize that you have the power to manifest the kind of life you desire . <h> 10 . Develop mindfulness <p> Lastly , learning how to live in the present moment is the most important way to break free from your conditioning . <p> By being mindful of the here and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each and every moment spontaneously , without being a victim of your past . <p> There are many meditation techniques out there that can help you to become mindful , so find the ones that you like most and stick to them until you see positive results in your life . <p> " The Matrix is a system , Neo . That system is our enemy . But when you 're inside , you look around , what do you see ? Businessmen , teachers , lawyers , carpenters . The very minds of the people we are trying to save .

Among the results , when compared to previous research focusing on Caucasian women , the study revealed differing patterns of cancer-causing mutations in African-American women . The authors say the results of the study , which will be presented Fridayat the 2016 San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium ( poster P5-10-04 ) , could help guide testing recommendations for at risk African American patients . <p> " We know African American women are more likely be diagnosed with breast cancer before age 45 , and are more likely to die from breast cancer at every age than Caucasian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of genetic mutations in order to provide more precise and targeted care , " said lead author Payal D. Shah , MD , an assistant professor of Hematology/Oncology in the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania and the Abramson Cancer Center . " The patterns suggest biological differences , and potentially different genetic factors . Identifying mutations that disproportionately affect African American women , if there are any , could potentially help guide the genetic testing we do for these at-risk patients . " <p> In the study , researchers examined DNA samples of 736 women in three patient groups African-Americans with cancer , African-Americans without cancer , and Caucasian patients without cancer in search of patterns of 19 genes known to cause breast and/or ovarian cancer . Notably , when compared to previous research using samples from Caucasian women , results of the study showed mutations of the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes presented similarly in both races , while CHEK2 gene mutations were seen less in young African American women , and cancer-causing mutations of the TP53 gene were more prevalent.Results also found differences in how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of uncertain significance " or mutations for which the implications on cancer risk is not known . In the populations studied , nearly 15 percent of African American women without cancer received these uncertain results , compared to roughly 11 percent of Caucasian women . <p> The authors suggest the disparity may be related to the higher proportion of Caucasians whose genetic information is included in reference databases , and anticipates that the ability to classify these mutations as cancer-causing or not will improve with more widespread testing including African-Americans , and increased data sharing among researchers and commercial laboratories . <p> " This study is a first step towards being able to zero in on the mutations that are more prevalent in African American patients , but future research is needed to better understand the patterns of genetic mutations across patient populations , " Shah said . " Our study clearly demonstrates that patients with cancer have more mutations than those without cancer , but studies examining African American and Caucasian patients with cancer might let us better compare the mutations that are disproportionately present in African Americans . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Domchek , Kara N.

@@21945276 @1945276/ <h> Is My Childs Anger Normal ? <p> Most children have occasional tantrums or meltdowns . They may sometimes lash out if they 're frustrated or be defiant if asked to do something they do n't  want to do .

The first step is understanding what 's triggering your childs behavior . There are many possible underlying causes , including : <p> ADHD : Many children with ADHD , especially those who experience impulsivity and hyperactivity , have trouble controlling their behavior . They may find it very hard to comply with instructions or switch from one activity to another , and that makes them appear defiant and angry . " More than 50 percent of kids with ADHD also exhibit defiance and emotional outbursts , " says Dr. Vasco Lopes , a clinical psychologist at the Child Mind Institute . Their inability to focus and complete tasks can also lead to tantrums , arguing , and power struggles . That does n't  necessarily mean they 've been diagnosed with ADHD " in fact , ADHD is sometimes overlooked in kids who have a history of severe aggression because there are so many bigger issues . <p> Anxiety : Children who seem angry and defiant often have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has anxiety , especially if she 's hiding it , she may have a hard time coping with situations that cause her distress , and she may lash out when the demands at school , for instance , put pressure on her that she ca n't handle . In an anxiety-inducing situation , your childs " fight or flight " instinct may take hold " she may have a tantrum or refuse to do something to avoid the source of acute fear . <p> Trauma or neglect : A lot of acting out in school is the result of trauma , neglect , or chaos at home . " Kids who are struggling , not feeling safe at home can act like terrorists at school , with fairly intimidating kinds of behavior , " says Dr. Nancy Rappaport , a Harvard Medical School professor who specializes in mental health care in a school setting . Most at risk , she says , are kids with ADHD whove also experienced trauma . <p> Learning problems : When your child acts out repeatedly in school or during homework time , its possible that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot of trouble with math , and math problems make him very frustrated and irritable . Rather than ask for help , he may rip up an assignment or start something with another child to create a diversion from his real issues . <p> Sensory processing issues : Some children have trouble processing the sensory information they are getting from the world around them . If your child is oversensitive , or undersensitive , to stimulation , things like " scratchy " clothes and too much light or noise can make her uncomfortable , anxious , distracted , or overwhelmed . That can lead to meltdowns for no reason that 's apparent to you or other caregivers . <p> Autism : Children on the autism spectrum are also often prone to dramatic meltdowns . If your child is on the spectrum , he may tend to be rigid " needing consistent routine to feel safe " and any unexpected change can set him off .

Some kids respond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them on the wall . <p> Consistent parentingWhen a childs defiance and emotional outbursts occur , the parent or caregivers response affects the likelihood of the behavior happening again . <p> If a childs behavior is out of control , or causing major problems , its a good idea to try step-by-step parent training programs . These programs ( like Parent-Child Interaction Therapy , or PCIT , and Parent Management Training ) train you to positively reinforce behavior you want to encourage in your child , and give consistent consequences for behaviors you want to discourage . Most children respond well to a more structured relationship , with calm , consistent responses from parents that they can count on . <p> Here are some of the key elements taught in parent training : <p> Do n't  give in . Resist the temptation to end your childs tantrum by giving her what she wants when she explodes . To give in only teaches her that tantrums work . <p> Remain calm and consistent . You 're in a better place to teach and follow through with better , more consistent consequences when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ angry responses tend to escalate a childs aggression , be it verbal or physical . By staying calm , you 're also modeling " and teaching " your child the type of behavior you want to see in him . <p> Use consistent consequences . Your child needs to know what the consequences are for negative behaviors , such as time outs , as well as rewards for positive behaviors , like time on the iPad . And you need to show him you follow through with these consequences every time . <p> Wait to talk until the meltdown is over . One thing you do n't  want to do is try to reason with a child who is upset . As Dr. Stephen Dickstein , a pediatrician and child and adolescent psychiatrist , puts it , " Do n't  talk to the kid when shes not available . " You want to encourage a child to practice at negotiation when shes not blowing up , and you 're not either . <p> Build a toolkit for calming down . Both you and your child need to build what Dr. Dickstein calls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calm down , like slow breathing , to relax , because you ca n't be calm and angry at the same time .

' Clients and employers will of course assess you on your technical ability , but a great deal more contributes to their overall impression of you . ' <p> ' If a candidate is late , messy , uncommunicative , rude or evasive , this all serves to undermine the perception of trust . This is n't restricted to interviews , as professionals are judged on how they conduct themselves every single day . ' <h> Demonstrating responsibility <p> ' Responsibility and trust go hand in hand , ' explains Ian Waters , ACCA head of standards . ' Every organisation relies on finance , which means finance professionals play a critical role in an organisation 's success .

' <p> ' This is why ACCA continues to drive professional responsibility in the finance sector , with a mandatory ethics module , a comprehensive ethical framework in the ACCA Rulebook that applies to students as well as members , and a positive engagement with the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants ( IESBA ) . ' <h> Striving for excellence <p> Manufacturers rely heavily on quality assurance ' , simply because one bad product can drive customers to buy elsewhere . Finance professionals must embrace quality assurance for the same reason , bearing in mind one critical difference " they take personal responsibility for their own quality assurance . <p> ' Quality assurance is an obligation that professionals have to their client or employer under the ethical principle of competence and due care , ' says Ros Leah .

This can take many forms , from improved business processes to initiatives that enhance team-working and morale . <p> Today 's professionals must also be more considerate of how their actions affect communities and the environment . In many sectors , corporate social responsibility has even become a driving force for business improvement . <h> Representing your profession <p> ' The conduct of professionals has a strong impact on their profession , ' explains Ian Waters .

' <p> In summary , professionalism encompasses every aspect of your presence as a service provider , and it may help to consider this in three layers . <p> At the core , professionalism means delivering your technical expertise reliably , responsibly , ethically , with continual pursuit of excellence , and in a way that adds value to your client or employer 's organisation . Supporting this are soft skills ' such as written and verbal communication , team-working and leadership .

A competitive admissions process is not just a private school phenomenon anymore . <p> " About a quarter of kids go to a school other than the one they 're assigned to , " says Bryan Hassel , co-author , with Emily Ayscue Hassel , of The Picky Parent Guide : Choose Your Childs School with Confidence . " Some fraction of the other three-quarters choose where they live because of a school , which is another way of exerting school choice . About 50 percent of families are exercising school choice . " <p> Advertisement <p> With the ever increasing assortment of options available to parents , its become important to not only research the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and unwritten , of admission . <p> In many communities , the admissions process can be fairly complicated . In New York City , for example , parents greatly increase their chances of success by learning the system . " New York City has 32 districts , 10 regions and 1,400 schools , " says Pamela Wheaton , Deputy Director of InsideSchools.org , a website devoted to New York City public schools . " In some districts in the city you can apply to schools that are n't  in your neighborhood and ask for what is called a variance . There are some programs that are open city wide . High school is pretty open , but there are some schools in certain areas of the city where unless you live in the district you cant apply . What counts for admission to many schools are the scores on the seventh grade test , but there are several systems . One is an Educational Option , which is a way of ensuring a mix of high- , middle- and low-achieving kids . So there 's a specific formula of how they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 50- percent are selected by the schools . " <p> Advertisement <h> Basic rules of the game <p> Regardless of how simple or complicated , competitive or not , your districts system is , there are some basic strategies that can be applied to help your child get into a great school . <p> 1 . Look for those up-and-coming , hot new schools <p> " The first tip to figuring out strategies is to broaden your perspective on which schools you would want to apply for , " says Deena Zacharin , former director of the Office of Parent Relations for the San Francisco Unified School District . " The best way to do that is to go see the schools themselves . Schools often have reputations that are seven to 10 years old . It takes a long time for a reputation to turn around with a school . But when you go and see the school , you see all the wonderful things that might be happening there . " <p> 2 . Avoid the herd mentality <p> Parents should look at a schools test scores as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is only part of the picture of a school . " You really have to talk to the principal and see what is going on in the classroom to determine if its a good fit for your family , " says Sandra Halladey , founder and former associate director of the San Francisco chapter of Parents for Public Schools . " Just because its a good fit for all your friends does n't  mean its a good fit for your family . What your next-door neighbor or your best friend might think is a wonderful school and is a perfect fit might not be the same for you . " <p> 3 . Do n't  mess up <p> Do n't  lose out because of missed deadlines or incomplete paper work . Hassel- cautions : " If it truly is a purely mechanical system , such as a lottery , then the most important strategy is to make sure that you get things in on time . Do n't  mess up . Do n't  mess up is one of those basic technical requirements . " <p> Even after you 've gotten your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Make sure that you read all the paper work that you get from the school district and that you respond in a timely manner to all the deadlines , " says Halladey . " If you 're offered a seat and if you do n't  go within the required time frame and accept that seat , then you 've lost it . " <p> 4 . Get your information from the right source <p> " Make sure you get information from the correct source , which is the district office , " warns Halladey . " Your school secretary or teacher might not have the latest information . " <p> If you believe your child is a bright student , a GATE program might be an entree to a better educational opportunity . Find out if GATE programs in your district are only offered in certain schools . Some GATE programs ask for nursery school assessments , while others might not require anything until third or fourth grade , when a GATE test is administered . <p> 6 . Consider new schools <p> Often public schools create small academies within larger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are opened , after the regular enrollment process is over . These schools may have seats available for months before word of their existence spreads . Check with your district for more information about new public and charter schools . Choosing a school without an established reputation is a risk , but new schools can provide exciting opportunities to form communities and to create positive change . <p> 7 . Find out if you can apply to more than one program at a school <p> " Some larger schools have several programs-such as one in art , or one in government , " says Wheaton of Insideschools.org . " So if that 's the school you want to go to , apply to all the programs , because once you get in you can transfer to the program you really want . " <p> 8 . Write directly to the school- principal <p> " One tip , even for the public school system , is to write a cover letter to the school that really zeros in on what we call your childs fit with the school , " says Hassel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the more mechanical lottery type systems . It never hurts to try , right ? Plus , its part of building your relationship with the school , if your child does ultimately go there . This letter should be brief and to the point . " <p> 9 . Apply to schools that require auditions or special admissions procedures , as well as to regular lottery schools <p> Some schools require auditions or portfolios of past work for admission . If you feel that your child has a special talent or a strong interest in a particular field , preparing for these schools will create more options for your child . <p> 10 . Use all preferences that apply to you <p> " Find out what kinds of preferences are built into the system , " says Hassel , " and make sure that you 're taking advantage of those that apply to you , such as sibling preferences and neighborhood preferences . Often public school lotteries have preferences for race , although race is supposed to be counting less , but with court decisions its possible that income counts . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the system . There is nothing that you can do about those preferences , either you have them or you do n't  , but make sure that you get any advantage that you can out of them . " <p> For example , there 's a twist on sibling preference that can sometimes be used . " It may be that getting your kindergartner into a school is easier than getting your second-grader in , " says Hassel . " If you get your kindergartner in , maybe your second-grader can go there the next year with the sibling preference . Understanding how that works can be really helpful . " <p> ( Note : Sibling preference deadlines are often earlier than regular enrollment deadlines . Be sure to know the different enrollment deadlines . ) <p> Finally , if it applies to your situation , find out what the inter- and intradistrict transfer rules are . Every state has rules that govern the use of interdistrict ( between districts ) and intradistrict ( within a district ) transfers . For example , in California , you can legally apply for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regardless of whether you live in that district . The district must consider your request , although they do not have to admit you if there are no seats available . Knowing the rules of district transfers might allow you to place your child in a school in a better district , however it probably wont help you land a spot in an oversubscribed school .

" The Stanford biologist champions sex-selective abortion as well as mass forced sterilization as legitimate methods to curb population growth . <p> In his 1968 book , Ehrlich went so far as to defend forced abortion , writing : " Indeed , it has been concluded that compulsory population-control laws , even including laws requiring compulsory abortion , could be sustained under the existing Constitution if the population crisis became sufficiently severe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the February conference will address what Vatican organizers call an unsustainable " imbalance " between the worlds population and what the earth is capable of producing . The event is jointly sponsored by the Pontifical Academy of Sciences and the Pontifical Academy of Social Sciences . <p> Organizers of the Vatican-run conference predict that if effective steps are not taken to reverse so-called man-made " global climate change , " then up to 40 percent of " all biodiversity on Earth " will be destroyed " by the end of this century , " including a " majority " of species of plants . <p> " There is no possibility of improving our situation without the widespread adoption of social justice , both as a matter of morality and as a matter of survival , " the event brochure put out by the Vatican states . <p> With the invitation of Ehrlich to address the conference , how the Pontifical Academies understand " social justice " takes on a sinister aspect . <p> In The Population Bomb , Ehrlich forecasted " an utter breakdown in the capacity of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for hundreds of millions , predictions that have proved to be false while his theories have been debunked . The biologist predicted in 1968 that half of Americans would die by 1990 . India and China would simply die out . By the year 2000 , England would also cease to exist . Ehrlic mentioned in his book sex-selection abortion as a potentially effective tool for conserving the worlds resources by reducing population , a position he continues to defend . <p> In a 2011 interview with Mara Hvistendahl , Ehrlich defended sex-selection abortion , stating that " it would be a good idea to let people have their choice so that they could have fewer children and could have what they wanted , " adding that a sex-selection abortion and possibly even infanticide might be a better fate for females than what awaited them in an overpopulated world . <p> " You can be aborted as a conceptus , you can be killed at birth , or you can be sold into slavery and die in a slum someplace , " he said . " It would be interesting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ situations when they are not killed or infanticided . " <p> URGENT : Sign the petition to the Holy Father urging him to stop this scandal . Click here . <p> In the same interview , Ehrlich also defended the principle behind mass forced sterilization , a concept mentioned in a 1977 book he co-authored titled Ecoscience : Population , Resources , Environment , suggesting that mass sterilization working in tandem with sex-selection technology would be particularly effective for population control interests . <p> Steven Mosher , president of the Population Research Institute , criticized the Vaticans choice of Ehrlich as a suitable speaker . <p> " Ehrlichs opinions on biological extinction rates are just as exaggerated as his failed predictions of a human population explosion . Why the Vatican should be giving a platform to this secular prophet of doom is beyond me , " he told LifeSiteNews . <p> " There are plenty of credible Catholic scientists around whose fact-based opinions should be highlighted by their Church . What 's next ? Inviting Ral Castro to speak on human rights ? " he added . <p> The Catholic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well . <p> Instead of seeing people as " mouths to feed , " " pollution producers , " or " carbon footprint makers , " the Church sees each person as a unique and unrepeatable gift from God . <p> In his watershed 1968 Encyclical Humanae Vitae that taught about the moral evil of using contraception to space birth , Pope Paul VI warned rulers of countries against using illicit methods of birth control to solve the " demographic problem . " <p> " Do not allow the morality of your peoples to be degraded ; do not permit that by legal means practices contrary to the natural and divine law be introduced into the fundamental cell , the family , " he urged at that time . <p> Paul VI warned the people of the world then that if contraception became a societal norm it would provide governments with a " dangerous weapon " to manipulate population sizes . <p> " Who will stop rulers from favoring , from even imposing upon their peoples , if they were to consider it necessary , the method of contraception @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a way men , wishing to avoid individual , family , or social difficulties encountered in the observance of the divine law , would reach the point of placing at the mercy of the intervention of public authorities the most personal and most reserved sector of conjugal intimacy , " he wrote . <p> Pope Francis has also explicitly rejected population control as a method to combat climate change , writing in his encyclical Laudato Si that to " blame population growth instead of extreme and selective consumerism on the part of some for lack of resources is one way of refusing to face the issues . " <p> Given the Churchs outright condemnation of abortion , contraception , and the use of coercive population control measures to curb demographics , it remains to be seen why the Pontifical Academies viewed the famed proponent of population control as a suitable speaker for their conference . <p> This is not the first time an advocate for positions contrary to the Catholic faith has been invited to attend Vatican conferences . The leaders of both Pontifical Academies have , under Francis pontificate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foremost proponents of abortion and population control , including Ban Ki-moon and Jeffrey Sachs . <p> In 2015 , Professor Margaret Archer , president of the Pontifical Academy of Social Sciences , slammed the Centre for Family and Human Rights Institute ( C-Fam ) , an American pro-life research institute that monitors the United Nations , after it raised concerns about abortion and population control proponents being given a platform at a Vatican conference on climate change . " I am appointed by the Pope and responsible directly to him . I 'm afraid that leaves you and your cohort out in the cold , " she told the organization at that time . <p> Bishop Marcelo Sanchez Sorondo , chancellor of the Pontifical Academy of Sciences , also has a history of inviting abortion and population control proponents to Vatican events . He has been criticized by pro-life advocates for unreservedly endorsing the United Nations controversial Sustainable Development Goals ( SDGs ) , which pro-lifers warn include a not-so-hidden abortion and population control agenda . Last year , Sorondo defended inviting then-Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders , an abortion advocate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Also attending the Vatican conference is African Cardinal Peter Turkson , who in a BBC interview in 2015 said " birth control " could " offer a solution " to the impacts of climate change .

( AP Photo/Andrew Harnik , File ) <p> A group of House conservatives will recommend their own Obamacare replacement on Wednesday . <p> The Republican Study Committee , led by Rep. Mark Walker of North Carolina , is proposing to replace President Obama 's healthcare law with a system where people can get tax deductions to help buy coverage on their own instead of through an employer . <p> The plan , dubbed The American Health Care Reform Act , closely mirrors one the RSC already proposed back in June 2015 , long before the prospect of repealing big parts of the law materialized with President-elect Donald Trump 's victory . It also calls for block-granting Medicaid , expanding the use of health savings accounts and allowing insurance to be sold across state lines . <p> Walker , along with former RSC Chairman Bill Flores and Rep.

" The RSC 's policy has always been strong , but Chairman Walker means to shake things up a bit . " <p> Yet the RSC plan departs in some significant ways from the " Better Way " health reform proposed by House Speaker Paul Ryan . <p> While the Ryan-backed plan would provide people with credits to buy coverage , the RSC plan would assist Americans less directly by reducing their taxable income if they buy a qualified health plan . <p> It would eliminate the tax break for employer-sponsored coverage and replace it with a standard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The deduction would reduce taxable income by $7,500 for individuals and by $20,500 for married couples . <p> It 's an even more conservative approach to health reform than Ryan 's plan .

A single poor adult earning $10,000 would get no income tax benefit and a payroll tax benefit of about $574 a year , far lower than the annual cost of most health plans , according to an analysis by the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities . <p> But the RSC and Ryan plans do share some commonalities .

@@21945341 @1945341/ <p> While plane crashes are rare , they are often widely reported ; seeing repeatedly graphic images of debris and covered-up bodies simply fills many of us so much fear that we cant bear the thought of getting on a plane . <p> Take the two recent Malaysian Airlines disasters . Flight 370 vanished somewhere over the Indian Ocean and Flight 17 was shot down over Ukraine . Two years on , both cases are still making headlines . Then there was the Germanwings disaster last year , when a suicidal pilot flew a passenger jet into a mountainside in the Alps ; not much later the Russian-owned flight Metrojet 9268 was blown up by a suspected bomb shortly after take-off from Egypt . <p> The experts , of course , simply point to the stats : your fear of flying is irrational , because you 're much more likely to die in a car crash than in a plane accident . Indeed , safety statistics by an airline association IATA show that in 2015 more than 3.5 billion people flew on commercial aircraft . During that time , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fatalities . Add in the Germanwings and Metrojet disasters , and the number of deaths is bumped up to 510 . <p> The World Health Organisation says that there were 1.25 million road traffic deaths globally in 2013 . Overall , car travel is about 100 times deadlier than flying . Meanwhile , the two things you 're most likely to die from are heart disease and cancer . <p> Still , our fear of flying wont budge . In the US alone , 17% of Americans admit that they are afraid to fly ( according to a 2010 survey by Boeing ) . Some are terrified of crashing ; others cant cope with being in an enclosed space with no way to escape . And then there are the famous cases . Movie director Wes Anderson ( Grand Budapest Hotel , The Royal Tenenbaums ) prefers travelling to Europe by boat . The late rock star David Bowie opted for boats and trains after a stormy flight from Cyprus in the early 70s ; he started flying again in the 1980s , but stopped again after suffering a heart attack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Winslet , meanwhile , reportedly travels in a different plane than her husband , to ensure they do n't  both die in a crash and leave their kids without parents . <p> Many people suddenly developed a fear of flying after 9/11 <p> " Unfortunately , there is no single explanation for why someone would develop such a phobia there are a lot of potential reasons , " says Matthew Price , a clinical psychologist at the University of Vermont , who researches anxiety disorders . There are people who are afraid of flying because theyve never stepped on a plane before , or have had some prior negative flying-related experience . " It may have been an actual flight , learning about a plane crash , or being anxious about being in an enclosed space . " <p> For instance , many people suddenly developed a fear of flying after 9/11 . According to psychologist Gerd Gigerenzer of the Max Planck Institute for Human Development , in the year after the tragedy this fear prompted thousands of Americans to opt for driving . It resulted in a decline in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ die in car crashes , because they misunderstood the risk of driving and exaggerated the probability of dying in a plane crash . <p> There is another category of people who are afraid of flying , and that 's because of anxieties in other areas . It could be a fear of loss of control , or of enclosed spaces , or even the fear of fear , says psychologist Robert Bor , a pilot and psychiatric consultant to the Royal Air Force . The fear can also be prompted by something that is not directly related to aviation , such as stress at work , marriage difficulties , or a sick child at home . <p> One factor that is making people worry is precisely what is meant to protect them : safety procedures at airports and on board . Anti-terrorism measures at airports make some of us think of criminals wanting to blow planes up , and safety videos prior to departure remind us that crashes do happen . So those prone to panic may want to avoid watching the safety video , but that 's a mistake . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the plane because they watched the safety demonstration are much more likely to do ok , and those who do n't  might find themselves not in the right frame to get out of the aircraft , " says Bor . Take the recent crash-landing of an Emirates plane in Dubai , when many passengers started grabbing their belongings , which added to the risk of evacuating the airplane . " During the safety demonstration , were told to leave our things and get out of the airplane quickly , but people do sometimes do extraordinary things when they are faced with danger that they had not anticipated , " says Bor . <p> Luckily , fear of flying is treatable , and there is n't a shortage of ways to deal with it . There are of course personal strategies some of us don headphones or drink alcohol ; others take anti-anxiety medication . Price recommends breathing exercises , slow deep breathes in through the mouth so that your belly expands while your chest remains relatively still , and then slowly out through the nose . " It can sometimes be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calm , " he adds . <p> Price and Bor agree that the best way to overcome the phobia of flying is controlled exposure <p> Perhaps a better initial strategy though for those without any experience of flying or with some prior negative association is learning about how airplanes work , says Bor why heavy metal objects like planes can indeed take off and fly , how air traffic control keeps planes at a distance from each other , and what happens during air turbulence . <p> The second , anxiety-prone group , might need hypnotherapy , psychotherapy , or cognitive behavioural therapy . Here the idea is to identify the cycle around the anxiety , how it builds up and carries on , how it can sometimes generate panicky feelings , and most importantly how to cope with them . <p> One approach is to read books on self-coping mechanisms , another is to visit a doctor . " You may only need one visit , not a 100 years on the couch with Sigmund Freud . Its very treatable but if you ignore it , it tends not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Bor agree that the best way to overcome the phobia of flying is controlled exposure . Following the old saying you have to face your fears , a person can systematically and gradually expose themselves to the various stages of flying , under guidance of a trained clinician . Traditionally , this training has been taking place on board , when therapists ( for a lot of money ) accompany you onto a plane and talk to you to alleviate your fears . <p> Another option of exposure involves virtual reality , where you can experience the various stages of flight even while you stay firmly on the ground . In the past , this was done with the help of simulators , with screens featuring the inside of a virtual plane on a virtual airfield , accompanied by the noise of engines . More recently , though , a new kid on the block has appeared : a VR headset . <p> Price analysed multiple studies on VR and flying , and concluded that VR is indeed efficient and effective in treating aviophobia . " For example , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very long take off , " says Bor . " Take off in an actual plane can only be as long as the runway . Take off in a virtual plane , however , can be drawn out longer because the stimuli are under the control of the therapist . " If you usually get stressed out on the way to the airport , or at the boarding gate , or during the cruising phase of the flight , the therapist can get you to experience exactly that in careful , controlled stages . Its also possible to instantly change the time of day , the weather , your seat on the plane and even the pilots mood depending on what worries you most . <p> To monitor anxiety levels , biometric sensors can be attached to a clients fingers . That 's exactly what tech reporter Luke Johnson of the website Wearable did , when he decided to experience the VR treatment first hand with the help of therapist Michael Carthy , who specialises in phobias . <p> VR targets the minds subconscious part , and the headset itself is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " This sparing use gives it even more of an impact though . You do n't  become desensitised to the virtual situations , instead it helps you face those moments of discomfort intermittently , and with purpose . " <p> Johnson was surprised to discover that he later managed to control his fear on a real flight much better than ever before . " Taking slow , deep breaths , smiling like a loon and holding my shoulders back , I did n't  feel afraid anymore . I felt comfortable , " he writes . <p> Barbara Rothbaum , a psychiatrist at Emory University School of Medicine in Atlanta , Georgia , compared exposure therapy with a virtual airplane with that of a real airplane. " 93% of participants flew after only eight sessions of treatment in both conditions , " she says . The first four sessions teach people anxiety management techniques , she explains , for example , how to identify unhelpful and irrational thoughts ( for example , " were going to crash , " ) and correct them . <p> The last four sessions then use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ therapeutic manner so that their anxiety decreases . " It seems to work equally well to use a real airplane or a virtual airplane , so the advantages of VR in this case is primarily feasibility its cheaper and easier and you can take off and land as many times as you need all within the 45-minute therapy sessions without leaving the office , " says Rothbaum . <p> Some people , however , strike out on their own , without a therapist . US businessman Clay Presley survived the 2009 Hudson crash , and was left with a fear of flying . So how did he overcome it ? By becoming a pilot himself . Not a solution for everyone , but perhaps some aviophones might follow his example . <p> If you liked this story , sign up for the weekly your inbox every Friday .

@@21945348 @1945348/ <h> Climate change prompts Alaska fish to change breeding behavior <p> One of Alaskas most abundant freshwater fish species is altering its breeding patterns in response to climate change . This could impact the ecology of northern lakes , which already acutely feel the effects of a changing climate . <p> That 's the main finding of a recent University of Washington study published in Global Change Biology that analyzed reproductive patterns of three-spine stickleback fish over half a century in Alaskas Bristol Bay region . The data show that stickleback breed earlier and more often each season in response to earlier spring ice breakup and longer ice-free summers . <p> While several papers have speculated that conditions brought on by a warming climate may allow animals to breed more often in a single year , this has only been empirically shown in insects . This study is the first to document multiple breeding cycles for fish in a single season due to climate change , said lead author Rachel Hovel , a postdoctoral researcher in the UWs School of Aquatic and Fishery Sciences . <p> " The exciting thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first time , the emergence of multiple breeding in a vertebrate as a response to climate change , " Hovel said . " Climate change literature features many predictions and vulnerability assessments , but we do n't  have many opportunities to actually observe species responses over time , as this is very data-intensive . Our ability to detect multiple breeding in fish is attributed to our comprehensive and high-quality long-term dataset . " <p> The data were collected from 1963 to 2015 in Alaskas Lake Aleknagik , home to one of the UWs Alaska Salmon Program research stations . The research program has for decades recorded the abundance of juvenile sockeye salmon and other fish that live in the regions freshwater lakes . For 52 years , fish were captured in nets along the lakeshore at 10 different sites every seven days between June and September . All fish were identified and measured . <p> While the programs monitoring was designed to track the commercially important sockeye salmon population , scientists also meticulously recorded every other fish present , including three-spine stickleback . Stickleback represent almost half of the fish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matching that percentage . Three-spine stickleback make up a large percentage of the fish communities in many northern lakes , so these findings could be relevant throughout the region , Hovel said . <p> " Alaska is warming about twice as rapidly as most of the rest of the planet , " she said . " These fish are adapted to survive in relatively cold environments with limited productive seasons . The responses to rapid warming that we see in lakes , like early spring ice breakup , are releasing some of these constraints . " <p> Stickleback are born near the shore , then move to the middle of the lake to feed on zooplankton . Adults return to the shore in the summer to spawn ; males will build the nest and attract a female , who then lays the eggs . Males guard the nest until the fish hatch , usually after about two weeks . <p> An adult male three-spine stickleback guards the nest , keeping the eggs free of debris and oxygenated.Jason Ching/University of Washington <p> By analyzing decades of data showing fish sizes throughout @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certain fish were born a larger fish captured in August was indicative of an early season brood , while a smaller fish captured on the same day likely came from a brood that hatched later in the summer . <p> Using these data and additional environmental data , researchers found that three-spine stickleback spawned earlier in years when ice breakup occurred earlier , and in some years , the fish produced more than one brood . Given the short summers in Alaska , most stickleback have time and stamina for only one brood , but increasingly they are rearing two broods a summer as climate change ushers in earlier springs . <p> These factors could have wider ecological effects , as three-spine stickleback are a dominant fish species in many northern lakes . This is particularly true for sticklebacks primary competitor in many coastal lakes in Alaska : juvenile sockeye salmon .

" It could also mean that fish are living shorter lives because there 's a higher physiological cost to breeding more than once . In the lower-latitude extent of their range , fish mature earlier and die earlier .

If the body makes extra uric acid , or if the kidneys can not clear enough of it , then uric acid levels in the blood will become too high , a condition known as hyperuricemia ( hyper-yur-i-see-me-ya ) . <p> Hyperuricemia is not a disease and may not cause problems , but if it continues for a long time and conditions in the body are right , crystals may form and cause gout . Most experts recommend that uric acid levels stay below 6.0 mg/dL in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the breakdown of purines , naturally-occurring chemicals that are found in both our diets and our bodies . Foods and drinks that contribute most to hyperuricemia and gout include : red meat , organ meat , seafood , beer , liquor , and sugar-sweetened items , especially with high fructose corn syrup . Health problems such as obesity , high blood pressure , high blood sugar , and high cholesterol may also lead to increased uric acid and the development of gout . And because some medications may also increase risk , you should review all your medications and supplements with your doctor . Other causes of hyperuricemia and gout include kidney disease , exposure to lead , hypothyroidism , severe illness or stress , and extreme physical exertion . <p> Some people with gout do not have high uric acid levels , so it is very important to maintain a healthy lifestyle no matter the level . Do not smoke , follow a well-balanced diet , maintain a healthy weight , and exercise . <h> Joint and Kidney Damage Caused by Gout <p> Uric acid crystals deposited in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very painful and can cause permanent kidney damage by 1 ) forming an obstruction that prevents your kidneys from removing wastes and causing infection , and 2 ) scarring the kidneys with rough or sharp edges . Both problems can lead to chronic kidney disease and even kidney failure . <p> Chronic kidney disease occurs when the kidneys have been damaged and/or kidney function has been greatly decreased for more than 3 months , and it is detected with routine laboratory tests . One of these tests is estimated glomerular filtration rate ( eGFR ) which determines the level of kidney function . Another test measures albumin in the urine and is called urine albumin-to--creatinine ratio ( ACR ) . Albumin in the urine may be a sign of kidney damage . <p> Kidney failure occurs when kidney function is so poor that there are severe symptoms , or when there is a need for dialysis or transplant to treat complications that could lead to more sickness and death . <h> Prevent Gout Attacks and Kidney Damage <p> Focus on lifestyle changes to reduce your risk for developing gout and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ factor for developing gout , but if you eliminate the causes of high uric acid such as obesity and high blood pressure , then you may prevent gout attacks . <p> Follow a healthy diet that contains mostly vegetables and fruits , whole grains , and low fat dairy products .

Avoid crash diets because they can make the urine more acidic , which makes it harder for uric acid to dissolve . <p> Drink at least 64 ounces of water a day ( 8 cups ) to help reduce the risk for stone formation . <p> You can also record your weight , blood pressure , gout symptoms , and triggers for your attacks .

Senate Republicans moved quickly in an overnight vote Wednesday to begin paving the way for a repeal of President Barack Obama 's health care reform law , commonly known as Obamacare . In dismantling the Affordable Care Act , an estimated 30 million people could potentially lose their health insurance , while millions more see their coverage drastically change . But how will an Obamacare repeal affect contraception coverage ? <p> In approving a budget resolution during an overnight voting spree on Wednesday , Senate Republicans opened the door to begin the process of repealing multiple aspects of the Affordable Care Act . While Republicans have vowed to " repeal and replace " Obama 's health care reform law , they 've so far offered few details on what or how they propose replacing Obamacare .

For women , one of the biggest benefits of the Affordable Care Act has been access to no-cost birth control . In 2012 , the Affordable Care Act defined birth control as a preventive care service , which required health insurance plans to cover it with no patient co-pay , effectively saving women a lot of money . In 2013 alone , the contraception mandate saved women more than $1.4 billion in out-of-pocket expenses , Reuters reported a study from the University of Pennsylvania showed . <p> JAY DIRECTO/AFP/Getty Images <p> The mandate is widely popular , according to a 2015 survey from the Washington Post and the Kaiser Family Foundation , which found 77 percent of women and 64 percent of men supported the Affordable Care Act 's contraception mandate .

In arguing the Affordable Care Act was " trampling on religious freedom " at the 2012 Conservative Political Action Conference , Rep.

He claimed there was not one woman who could n't afford to cover the cost of her own birth control . " Bring me one woman who has been left behind . Bring me one . There 's not one , " Price said . <p> The truth is , Republicans do n't need to repeal Obamacare in full to deny women access to no-cost contraception . Rather , they need only to remove birth control from the list of preventative services providers are required to cover without co-pay . <p> In light of repeated threats of repeal , some states have sought ways to preserve the access to free contraception . California , Vermont , Illinois , and Maryland moved to enact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Now , with Trump pushing Congress to immediately repeal Obamacare , New York , Minnesota , Colorado , and Massachusetts are looking to pursue similar measures to ensure contraception is fully covered by health insurance providers . <p> While there 's not much good news about how a repeal of the ACA will affect women 's reproductive health , women will likely have some time to plan and prepare should Republicans and President-elect Trump follow through with promises to immediately repeal Obamacare . According to some health policy experts , it 's likely that changes to the no-cost contraception mandate will not come into effect until annual insurance plans come to an end on Dec. 31 , 2017.

" Instead of sharp , pointed needles , dull needles are placed into the exact same holes on your fistula every time you have dialysis . Inserting the needles in the same holes creates a " tunneled track " for the needle . Over time this may be less painful because you do not have to use sharp needles to make new holes in your skin and in your fistula . The track is a tunnel created through the skin and fistula by the formation of scar tissue - just like the hole made in an earlobe for a pierced earring .

@@21945374 @1945374/ <h> How do snowflakes form ? Get the science behind snow <h> SHARE <p> A : A snowflake begins to form when an extremely cold water droplet freezes onto a pollen or dust particle in the sky . This creates an ice crystal . As the ice crystal falls to the ground , water vapor freezes onto the primary crystal , building new crystals the six arms of the snowflake . <p> That 's the short answer . <p> The more detailed explanation is this : <p> The ice crystals that make up snowflakes are symmetrical ( or patterned ) because they reflect the internal order of the crystals water molecules as they arrange themselves in predetermined spaces ( known as " crystallization " ) to form a six-sided snowflake . <p> Ultimately , it is the temperature at which a crystal forms and to a lesser extent the humidity of the air that determines the basic shape of the ice crystal .

A crystal might begin to grow arms in one manner , and then minutes or even seconds later , slight changes in the surrounding temperature or humidity causes the crystal to grow in another way . Although the six-sided shape is always maintained , the ice crystal ( and its six arms ) may branch off in new directions . Because each arm experiences the same atmospheric conditions , the arms look identical . <p> Q : So , why are no two snowflakes exactly alike ? <p> A : Well , that 's because individual snowflakes all follow slightly different paths from the sky to the ground and thus encounter slightly different atmospheric conditions along the way . Therefore , they all tend to look unique , resembling everything from prisms and needles to the familiar lacy pattern .

While you can take the clove anytime during the day that suits you , I 've found that just before bed seems to work the best . <p> Using a clove of garlic per day starting a few days before overseas travel and continuing until you return is a helpful tip for the prevention of food poisoning . <p> Incidentally , eating a clove of garlic everyday is a great way to slowly improve intestinal health .

You do n't  consume the entire head at once , however . <p> Whew ! <p> You consume one clove every couple of hours from waking until bedtime . <p> If the raw cloves are too hot for you to consume , I would suggest making this recipe for- pickled garlic .

All work wonderfully well for antibiotic purposes with the exception of elephant garlic ( Allium ampeloprasum ) . <p> Elephant garlic heads are large , covering the entire palm of an adults hand in some cases .

Be sure to remove the papery covering on each clove first . Follow this approach only if the thought of tasting pure garlic is too overwhelming . If taken this way , consume the clove with a glass of milk or with food to prevent the possibility of indigestion . <p> If the taste of garlic does n't  bother you , the most potent method for taking a clove is to crush it with a fork or garlic press . Then , - let the crushed clove sit for about 15 minutes on a small plate or cutting board . Letting it stand for a few minutes exposed to the air powers up the anti-microbial properties in the garlic .

The USDA says we eat 31 percent more packaged food than fresh food , in terms of volume . <p> Photo by Fotolia/adisa <h> Content Tools <p> Mixing food writing and history , adding a dash of cookbook , Grow Food , Cook Food , Share Food ( Oregon State University Press , 2013 ) by Ken Albala , shares the story of what happened when he started taking food history seriously and embarked on a mission to grow , cook , and share food in the ways that people did in the past in a mission to escape industrial processed food . In Albalas compelling book , obscure seventeenth-century Italian farmer-nobles , Roman statesmen , and quirky cheesemakers from the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries all offer lessons about our relationship with the food we eat . The following excerpt is from " Second Course , Cook Food . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ witnessed a meteoric rise of interest in food and cooking in the popular media . This has been manifest in bestselling cookbooks , an ever-growing number of cooking shows on multiple television networks , and brisk sales of food magazines ( despite the demise of Gourmet ) . This interest has spilled over into academia . Food has become a serious object of study across the disciplines and there are several major encyclopedias , food book series , journals , conferences , and classes throughout college curricula . <p> Ironically , at the same time , there has been a decrease in actual home cooking . Home-cooked meals prepared from scratch declined from 72 percent of all meals eaten in 1980 to 59 percent in 2010 . With the exception of a few ardent souls who truly enjoy spending time in the kitchen , the majority of Americans consider cooking an odious chore , something to be finished as quickly and efficiently as possible so they can get back to doing other , more important , things . Thus people are perfectly satisfied with having others cook for them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you will find not only fast food chains , but the same half-dozen or so casual dining franchises , where the food is made in a factory , arrives frozen , and is microwaved to order . The proliferation is actually staggering ; my son and I recently counted nineteen separate Subway sandwich shops where we live , in Stockton , California , a city of about 300,000 . Most of the units are located within a radius of just a couple of miles , in the north part of the city . <p> When not eating out , those who do n't  cook are happy buying convenience foodsprepared meals frozen , canned , freeze-dried , or processed to such an extent that little action is required beyond heating . Stroll down the center aisles of any supermarket to witness the proliferation of ready-made and convenience foods . Processed food ( as opposed to whole ingredients that must be cooked ) accounts for 80 percent of food sold in the United States , in terms of profit . The USDA says we eat 31 percent more packaged food than fresh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the manufacturers of convenience food and are assured that what comes in the package will please their sensesand science guarantees that it will , not only with ample salt and sugar , but also with chemical flavors and fragrances that approximate the taste and aroma of real food . Consumers also trust that such prepared meals will sustain their bodies physiologically , socially , and perhaps even spiritually . By convenience food I mean anything ready to eat , or that only needs heating , so this includes much of the so-called health food , organic food , and nutraceutical fare among the fastest growing sectors of the food industry . Not only the latest atai berry bar and live lactobacillus acidophilus probiotic concoctions , but also organic Cheetos . Add to that the many weight-loss programs that require purchasing frozen meals . Convenience foods are slowly insinuating themselves into every corner of the grocery : little plastic packages of cut-up apples ( because children are apparently no longer aware of how to use their teeth ) sprayed with chemicals , an entire aisle of breakfast cereals , another of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there are " complete , " ready-made meals showing up everywhere . In the ethnic foods aisle there are boxes of pad thai , Mexican taco kits , vindaloo in a bagpretty much anything to prevent you from actually trying to cook these foods .

Do n't  forget those things that give the illusion of cookingcake mixes , cookie dough or biscuits in a tube , prebaked pizza dough . All these ultimately lure the consumer away from cooking foods from scratch , even though it is usually much less expensive and just as easy to do so . <p> Whether this was a kind of conspiracy on the part of the food industry to enslave the public is immaterial ; the results are incontrovertible . To maximize profit margins ( Tater Tots cost much more than the same weight of potatoes ) , the proliferation of convenience foods has left nearly an entire hapless generation bereft of many of the most basic cooking skill sets . We have become de-skilled . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ require time and patience . A 2010 Department of Labor survey says that the average American ( as household head ) spent thirty-two minutes each day preparing food and cleaning up . That is compared to two hours and forty-five minutes watching TV . It also seems ironic that the more obsessed Americans become with watching cooking on TV , the less they actually do it . A similar situation , one might argue , applies to sports and sex . Even more ironically , eating , moving our bodies physically , and reproducing are three of our speciess most essential biological functions . We would not survive without these behaviors , and yet , we let professionals do it while we watch . Perhaps it is the perception that professionals do these so well that discourages us from even trying . In any case , the more we watch others cook , the less we do it ourselves , and perversely , the less we know how to do it . <p> But if we have become de-skilled , then our ancestors must have been proficient in the kitchen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a century or more ago . The historian in me must ask , what kind of evidence can prove that ? While numerous studies have shown our own lack of confidence in the kitchen in recent years , no studies exist showing that in the past , people routinely executed complicated culinary tasks . The fact that such procedures are amply described in cookbooks is certainly no evidence ; perhaps just as today , people were armchair chefs , merely fantasizing about cooking grand recipes and throwing magnificent dinner parties . That is , cookbooks are never a good record of what people actually ate . They are more often aspirational ; prescriptive rather than descriptive . Moreover , although we tend to think that the proliferation of fast food and casual dining spots is a modern phenomenon , there have always been , at least in cities , quick , inexpensive places to eat out , such as taverns , saloons , lunch counters , and cafeterias . It may come as a surprise that many apartments in the nineteenth century did not include cooking facilities , and many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On the other hand , until the twentieth century , a much greater percentage of people lived outside cities , and someone , most likely the farmers wife , did the cooking . Not that this cooking was necessarily complex , but it was cookingtransforming raw ingredients into palatable nourishment . <p> We do know that with the rise of industrial food processing in the late nineteenth century , many basic procedures became obsolete in home cooking . Many factors were involved , including transportation , refrigeration technology , increasing urbanization , and marketing and branding . All these were bound to make consumers less knowledgeable about the origins of ingredients and how to deal with such foodstuffs . Slaughtering animals could only legally be done by professionals with inspectors present , thanks to stringent health regulationsnecessary when the scale and speed of slaughter made careful monitoring more difficult . While rural families might still have practiced home canning , most people purchased foods in tin cans , which was preferred for its scientific cleanliness , consistency , and reliability . Instead of curing meat at home , people relied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it came to cheese , local dairies gave way to Kraft , who could afford the new pasteurization equipment . All these procedures were deemed simply not possible to do at home . In the interest of scientifically controlled safety standards , factories took over these household tasks , manufacturing standardized , homogenous , and , one could argue , aesthetically inferior products . But they were considered safe and hygienic . No doubt there were accidental poisonings in the past . A whole family might get sick from eating something spoiled , though wide-scale outbreaks of E. coli , listeria , and other pathogens were simply not possible because food was not processed on the same scale or shipped as far . Without contemporary surveys , we have little knowledge of the scale of such activities before industrialization , but it is undeniable that the expertise in how to make such foods has progressively diminished , especially as agriculture itself was mechanized and fewer people lived on farms , as women entered the workplace in greater numbers , and as messy physical labor in the kitchen was increasingly seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ techniques , but fundamental cooking skills , such as making stock from scratch rather than using a bouillon cube or can , shelling fresh peas rather than opening a frozen bag of Birds Eye , or even baking fresh bread using locally milled flour and wild starters . All these took time , and since time was to be spent either in productive , money-making work , or in leisurely escape , time spent in the kitchen when you could be elsewhere was simply time wasted . <p> This line of reasoning , I will argue , has left us profoundly disconnected from our food in ways that are dangerous socially , environmentally , culturally , and indeed aesthetically if we consider the quality of much industrial food . Now we have seen the rise of many artisanal products , excellent cheese , bread , local jams and such , and these are superb . But they are still by and large things we leave to others to make , and they are products that for the most part are expensive luxuries , not everyday items or household staples . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So what I will propose is looking to the past , relearning those techniques which were once described in cookbooks , which practically no one does anymore , and which have almost completely vanished from the culinary literature . The question I hope will arise immediately is , Why ? Why do something difficult and perhaps even dangerous , when you can let someone else do it ? I contend that making your own food is not only inherently entertaining , but connects you to food in a direct and palpable way , such that it makes you a more social , responsible , and spiritually fulfilled individual .

In addition , veterans with medical conditions or injuries incurred or that worsened during active-duty military service may be eligible for disability compensation from the Department of Veterans Affairs ( VA ) . <p> Until 2003 , military retirees eligible for disability compensation could not receive both their full retirement annuity and their disability compensation . Instead , they had to choose between receiving their full retirement annuity from DoD or receiving their disability benefit from VA and forgoing an equal amount of their DoD retirement annuity ; that reduction in the retirement annuity is typically referred to as the VA offset . Because the retirement annuity is generally taxable and disability compensation is not , most retirees chose the second alternative . <p> As a result of several laws , starting with the National Defense Authorization Act for 2003 , two classes of retired military personnel who receive VA disability compensation ( including those who retired before the enactment of those laws ) can now receive payments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offset , benefiting from what is often called concurrent receipt . Specifically , retirees whose disabilities arose from combat are eligible for combat-related special compensation ( CRSC ) , and veterans who retire with at least 20 years of military service and who receive a VA disability rating of at least 50 percent are eligible for what is termed concurrent retirement and disability pay ( CRDP ) . CRSC is exempt from federal taxes , but CRDP is not ; some veterans would qualify for both payments but must choose between them . <p> Beginning in 2018 , this option would eliminate concurrent receipt of retirement pay and disability compensation : Military retirees now drawing CRSC or CRDP would no longer receive those payments , nor would future retirees . As a result , the option would reduce federal spending by $139 billion between 2018 and 2026 , the Congressional Budget Office estimates . <p> In 2015 , of the roughly 2 million military retirees , about 55 percent were subject to the VA offset ; about 50 percent of that latter group " or 575,000 retirees " got concurrent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " just over $1 billion in 2005 " has climbed sharply because of both an expansion in the program 's parameters and an increase in the share of military retirees receiving disability compensation . In particular , the share of military retirees receiving a longevity-based retirement annuity who also receive disability compensation rose from 33 percent in 2005 to just over 50 percent in 2015 . <p> One argument for this option is that disabled veterans would no longer be compensated twice for their service , reflecting the reasoning underlying the creation of the VA offset . However , military retirees who receive VA disability payments would still receive higher after-tax payments than would nondisabled retirees who have the same retirement annuity because VA disability benefits are not taxed . <p> An argument against this option is that DoD 's retirement system and VA 's disability program compensate for different characteristics of military service : rewarding longevity in the former case and remunerating for pain and suffering in the latter . In addition , if fewer retirees applied for VA disability compensation because concurrent receipt was no longer available " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might bypass other VA services such as health care or vocational training .

To help diagnose the problem , ask a colleague or friend to clap when you use a filler word .

When uttering fillers , you may look confused or sound less confident than during other times of speech , said John Bates a Los Angeles-based leadership communications trainer whose corporate clients include NASA and Accenture . <p> Power pause <p> Most people use filler words to allow their speech to catch up to the thoughts in their head . So , instead , try to allow yourself a " powerful pause " of one or two seconds in your sentences , which can help achieve the same goal . <p> Stop speaking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Rather than speaking with fillers while processing what you want to say , its more effective to stop speaking for a second or two as you take time think .

To listeners , pausing for a quick second or two can also be helpful because most people process information slower than speakers can say it , she added . <p> Even as you learn to pause , being " fully present " in a conversation by avoiding distractions can make it easier to speak more coherently , because you 're more focused on choosing the correct words , Bates said . That means avoiding distractions such as the buzz of a smartphone or browsing the internet . Stay entirely engaged in your words . <p> Public speaking jitters <p> Managing anxiety helps too .

Being especially mindful of your speech during your trouble spots can make it easier to avoid the traps of using fillers . <p> If you 're giving a presentation , fillers can especially creep up in the introduction , conclusion and any complex parts of the presentation . Rather than memorise your entire presentation , pay special attention to those parts . Being confident in your words will help reduce the use of fillers , Cohen explained .

No play was bigger than Samuel 's **26;228;TOOLONG catch-and-run on third-and-9 in the second overtime with Ohio State trailing 27-24 . They 'll talk about Samuel 's mad dash for generations in Ohio . <p> Samuel caught a swing pass at the Michigan 29 , four yards behind the line of scrimmage . Michigan star Jabrill Peppers closed in on him so Samuel stopped on a dime and reversed field to the left . Samuel went all the way back to the 32-yard line -- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tackled there -- and stopped again because Michigan 's defensive tackle Ryan Glasgow was approaching . <p> So Samuel cut back again to the right , but ran into Ohio State offensive lineman Jamarco Jones . With his momentum stilted , Samuel reversed field one more time back to the left , cut inside to avoid additional tacklers , and lunged one yard short of the first down . <p> " I felt like I had a great shot by going back across the field because there were probably D-linemen over there running , " Samuel said . " A bunch of things are going on . I 'm running back and forth , but I know the defense is probably tired . I just got to keep on going , keep on moving . " <p> Said Meyer : " It was not designed for a great athlete to run around that way . That 's called recruiting . " <p> Facing fourth-and-1 at the Michigan 16 , Meyer could have called for a field goal to try to force a third overtime . But Meyer thought back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , used to say . <p> " If you ca n't get that far , you 're not a championship team , " Meyer said . " We used to talk about that all the time , and I agree with him . So that actually crossed my mind . " <p> Did Barrett actually get that far to make Ohio State a non-championship team that 's headed to the playoff ? ( See , we told you this game was weird . ) Should Michigan have won ? There 's a case to be made Barrett was short . There 's a case to be made there was n't enough evidence for replay to overturn the call on the field , allowing Samuel 's 15-yard touchdown scamper on the next play for the victory . <p> " My view on the first down was it was that short , " Harbaugh said , holding his hands apart a few inches . <p> " That stopped the heart for a second , " Meyer said . " When the official said , ' They 're buzzing me for the spot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' I was standing right there . I thought he had it . " <p> Inches . That 's all that separates Ohio State and Michigan . That 's all that separates Penn State from going to Indianapolis and Ohio State happy that it gets to stay home this week . <p> When the madness had ended , no one could move in the mosh pit on the Ohio Stadium field . Gloves , hats , bottles and even a pair of eyeglasses got left behind , lining the field as a reminder of what everyone just witnessed . <p> And there was Meyer -- not wanting to leave after stealing a victory Michigan was so close to grabbing , not wanting to let go of his son 's shoulders , not wanting to let this insanely , joyful moment pass after 3 hours and 51 minutes of stress News , ...

Long-term lack of proper sleep could lead to several health issues including heart problems , high blood pressure , impaired brain activity , memory difficulties , weight gain , weakened immunity and even stroke . <p> By getting enough sleep each night , you 'll not only be more focused and energised , but you 'll live a longer and healthier life . Here are 20 ways to improve your sleep routine : <p> 1 . Set an alarm . Alarms are not just needed for the mornings . Setting an alarm to notify you that it 's time to go to bed can also improve your sleeping patterns drastically . Also try and stick to a sleeping schedule , waking up and going to bed at the same time each day . <p> 2 . Do n't snooze . It 's tempting , we know . But those short sleep sessions between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , according to scientific studies , snoozing disrupts REM sleep which leads to you feeling more tired than you would 've had you got out of bed straight away . <p> 3 . Scale down on alcohol . While a nightcap tends to help you fall asleep more easily , it does n't lead to better sleep . Instead , it could prompt your body to feel the need to wake up more often throughout the night . It could also result in severe snoring and sleep apnea due to the deep sleep alcohol can also induce . <p> 4 . Block out the light . Try and dim the lights in your room at least 30 minutes before you plan to go to sleep . If you need to read before you doze off , try and keep the lights as low as possible. - Also ensure you have thick curtains since even the faintest of light ( from the moon for example ) could prevent your body from reaching a deep sleep .

The light emitted by the digital screens actually fools your body into thinking it should still be awake . Rather read a book and keep social networking out of your bedroom . <p> 7 . Cut the caffeine . While not everyone feels the effects of caffeine , experts still suggest coffee drinkers have their last cup in the afternoon . Since caffeine tends to linger in the body for a number of hours after consuming it , it could prevent you from falling asleep . <p> 8 . Exercise regularly .

The colour of your room 's walls could have an impact on your overall mood and sleep pattern . Pick tranquil , neutral colours and rather use accessories like cushions to add some colour . <p> 11 . Enjoy the silence . To block out a harassing mosquito or snoring partner , invest in a pair of earplugs .

An uncomfortable mattress could be the main reason for you staying up all night . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too soft ? Bumpy mattresses disturb sleep . Opt for a mattress that 's not too hard or too soft , especially if you have back or neck problems . <p> 13 . Grab a nap . If you simply ca n't avoid working late most days of the week , try and steal a quick 20-minute nap to reboot your system . Many corporate workers now set aside time in their busy office lives to nap and some offices are even including sleep rooms for their employees . Just make sure you never nap for more than 30 minutes " you 'll feel more drowsy if you do . <p> 14 . Let 's separate . Many partners sleeping in the same bed often find themselves waking up and fighting to reclaim their bit of the duvet . Perhaps using separate blankets is a good idea . <p> 15 . Think it through .

Whether it 's relaxing yoga , prayer or meditation , these practises shortly before bed not only calm the mind but also slow down your heart rate and breathing , helping your body fall asleep more easily . <p> 17 . Progressive muscle relaxation . Many meditation methods make use of this . Lie flat on your back and imagine each muscle from your forehead to your toes " relaxing one at a time . This relaxes the body , improves quality of sleep and limits fatigue . <p> 18 . Get up and go . If you really ca n't fall asleep , it 's time to get up and do something . By remaining in bed , you just stress more about the fact that you ca n't sleep . Distract your mind with a simple activity like washing the dishes or folding laundry . Then go back to bed without thinking too much about the interruption . <p> 19 . Get some sun .

If there 's ever an emergency " no matter where you are " you can call 911 for help . <p> Unfortunately , that sense of security is partly an illusion . <p> Your wireless device has a big limitation : It does n't give the 911 operator your exact location . So if you ca n't talk " which is often the case in a medical emergency or a crime in progress " it may be difficult or impossible for emergency responders to find you in time . <p> " It 's a public safety hazard that is largely unrecognized , " said Jamie Barnett , director of the Find Me 911 Coalition . " People 's lives are at risk right now because they can not count on 911 being able to find them when they call from a cell phone . " <p> On TV crime dramas , when the good guys want to find someone , they simply go to their computers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In real life , it 's not quite so easy . <p> If you 're outdoors , and your phone 's GPS chip can connect with satellites above or the phone hits a series of cell towers on the ground , the 911 operator will know your latitude and longitude " within 50 meters or so " most of the time . <p> But make that emergency call from inside a building " where it 's hard for your phone to " see " the satellites and cell signals tend to bounce around a lot " and your location information could be off by 100 meters or more . <p> " We have to do better , " said Todd Piett , chief product officer with Rave Mobile Safety .

She was able to call 911 , but her speech was slurred and she could n't tell the dispatcher where she was . Because she was inside a high rise , the location information provided by the cell tower was way off . <p> It took nearly eight hours to find her . Remarkably , Thomas was still alive when medics arrived and she was rushed to the hospital . <p> This is an extreme example , but far from an isolated case . The Find Me 911 Coalition recently surveyed emergency dispatchers in all 50 states and found that most ( 82 percent ) do not have a great deal of confidence in the location data automatically displayed for wireless calls . More than half ( 54 percent ) said that information is regularly inaccurate . <p> The problem is only going to get worse <p> The Federal Communications Commission ( FCC ) estimates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ centers now come from wireless phones " that 's more than 400,000 calls a day .

And these numbers are sure to go up as even more people pull the plug on their land-line phone service at home . <p> The FCC has heard the complaints " and the horror stories " and has acknowledged the potential threat to public safety . In a speech last year , FCC Commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel said that " if you call 911 from a wireless phone indoors , cross your fingers , because FCC location standards for emergency calls do not apply indoors . " <p> " In most cities , just a few meters can mean the difference between several buildings and that can be the difference between life and death .
