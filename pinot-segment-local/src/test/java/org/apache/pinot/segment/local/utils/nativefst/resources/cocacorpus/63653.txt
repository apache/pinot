@@40870761 @870761/ <p> When you create a new season for the first time in a league , the grouping of teams into different series is done by lottery . When it is not the first season the new grouping is based on the results of the previous season . Teams are ranked in order of division , position , points , goal difference etc . For example a team finishing 3rd in a division can never rank higher than a team finishing 2nd in another series in the same division even if the 3rd placed team has more points . <p> Here is an example of how teams can be grouped into different series and divisions : <p> 9 ( 6th placed team in Final League ) 12 ( 2nd placed team in first division that did not get promoted ) 13 ( Highest ranked 3rd placed team in first division ) 16 ( Lowest ranked 4th placed team in first division ) 17 ( Highest ranked 5th placed team in first division ) 20 ( 2nd highest ranked league winner from second division ) 21 ( 3rd highest ranked league @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2nd placed team from second division ) <p> Division 1 , series b 10 ( 7th placed team from Final League ) 11 ( 8th placed team from Final League ) 14 ( Lowest ranked 3rd placed team in first division ) 15 ( Highest ranked 4th placed team in first division ) 18 ( Lowest ranked 5th placed team in first division ) 19 ( Highest ranked league winner from second division ) 22 ( Lowest ranked league winner from second division ) 23 ( Highest ranked 2nd placed team from second division ) <p> And so on ... <p> The numbers on the left indicate the team 's rank . The reason for grouping the teams in this way is to make the series as evenly matched as possible . <p> All new teams start at the bottom and can never be placed in a higher division than a team that played in the previous season . The ranking amongst new teams is random . <p> Grouping of teams according to the manager 's origin If the league admin is a vip member there is also an additional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then choose to take the manager 's origin in consideration . By doing this all teams with managers from the same country ( or region ) would then be grouped in the same series within the same division ( same level ) . This option is applied in our two official league systems ( The Xpert Leagues and The Xpert Ladies ) . <p> Handling of possible free places A free place arises when a team has been inactivated and thereby been removed from the league . Any teams that have either lost a qualification match for promotion ( Xpert leagues ) or finished in the same position in the same division as a promoted team but in a different series will take a free place in a higher division ahead of relegated teams in that division . <p> For example if a team is inactivated in the first division and there are 2 series in the second division and the second placed team with most points has been promoted , the second placed team in the other series in the second division will take the free place ahead of any relegated teams in the first division . 
@@40870762 @870762/ <p> Special player qualities : Each quality is such that a player either has it or not . The qualities are shown with small symbols and if you place the mouse pointer over the symbols you get a brief description of the quality . Note that these special qualities have a very marginal effect compared to the skill and form of a player . This means you can manage quite alright without getting to bogged down in the special qualities . They are above all there to give players some character but if you make good use of them you can gain a slight advantage . However , as mentioned above , it is the skill and form of a player that is most important . There are a number of special qualities and there are more to come : <p> If a player has this symbol it means the player is easily injured . The risk is double that of a normal player . <p> If a player has this symbol he/she is money fixated and will perform considerably better if a bonus for winning is promised but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> A player with this quality likes to train a lot . All increases in form will be 25% greater and all reductions will be 25% smaller . <p> A player with this symbol of a joker is an all-round player who can play in any position with only a minor loss in skill . An outfield player who is all-round will perform at 85% of his/her capacity ( 60% for normal players ) in a position he/she is not used to and 60% of his/her capacity playing in goal . Goalkeepers who are all-round will perform at 60% of their capacity when playing in any other position . <p> Players that are intelligent have a good understanding of the game and are able to read the situations better and find ways to play like no other . An intelligent player can in other words be useful both in the defence and in the offence . Goalkeepers and defenders can ward off chances by reading the opponents intentions . Midfielders and forwards can find smart ways to get around the opponents defence . This special quality has no negative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also perform a little better as playmaker than if he/she did n't have this special quality . Note that the player 's skill still is important when you choose a playmaker . But if the difference in skill between the midfielders is n't very big then this special quality might give you more options . <p> If a player has this symbol he/she has deep feelings for the club and he/she will perform roughly 5% better than players without this quality . He/she will also fight harder than others when the team is struggling and will perform an extra 3% better than other players if your team is losing . <p> For a player to get this quality he/she either has to play at least 14 competitive matches for the club or have been in the club for at least 3 months . If a player has been to the club more than 3 months and has n't received the red heart yet , he needs to play at least one more competitive match for the team in order to get that symbol . Players who belonged to the original @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well as players brought up from the youth team will have this quality from the start . <p> If a player has this symbol it means he/she has played at least 100 competitive matches for the club and has become a legend in the club . This golden heart replaces the ordinary heart . A player with a golden heart will also fight harder when the team is struggling . So if the team is losing the player with a golden heart will perform another 3% better than a player with an ordinary heart . <p> A player with this symbol is a specialist in taking freekicks . Keep in mind though that how good a player is in taking freekicks also depends a lot on his skill level . This means that a player with this quality but with low skill will not be very good in taking freekicks , This quality however makes a player twice as good on freekicks compared to a player of equal skill but without this quality . <p> A player with this quality is cool headed and handles pressure well . A player @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a goalkeeper with this quality will be somewhat better at saving penalties compared to a goalkeeper without this special quality . Also , every player with this quality will perform somewhat better during the last part of the games and also in extra time as his ability to cope with the situation mentally is better than other players . <p> Players with this quality are leaders . They prefer to lead the team and do not want to just be one in the crowd . They are not very fond of other leaders competing with them to be team captain . They can accept not being team captain as long as the captain is a considerably better player and therefore deserves respect . However if the captain is a player of equal or even less skill they will not be happy especially if the captain is also a leader . A leader is perfect in the role of team captain and if he/she is one of the team 's more skilled players he/she will inspire the rest of the team to achieve more and be especially useful when the team @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ team captain in the section on tactics . <p> If a player has this symbol he/she is a real tough guy who tackles hard and is not very pleasant to play against . Because this type of player plays near the limit of what is allowed he/she gets more yellow and red cards than others . This player does n't perform as well as other players when the team is instructed to play carefully . But he will perform better than others when the team is instructed to play bruising . <p> A player with this symbol talks a lot on the pitch and is the one who complains to the referee when things go against him/her or the team . This all too often results in unnecessary yellow and red cards . <p> A player with this quality , represented by an oscar 's statuette , is a real play-actor who tries to gain advantages through unsportsmanlike and dishonest methods . He/she quite often succeeds because practice makes perfect , but because of the dubious methods he/she uses he/she also gets more yellow and red cards , especially when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have players with this quality in the team when you are using cheating tactics . <p> A player with this symbol is a moody player . This means the player 's performance can vary quite a bit depending on his/her mood . It can vary from 30% below to 30% above normal capacity . It will be different from match to match but it will not vary during a match . The mood of the player depends only on if he/she is having a good day or not and is independent of other factors such as skill and form . <p> A player with this symbol is a diva , which means that he/she think he is better than the other players and finds it harder to get along with the other players . This means that it will take longer for the player 's team work value to adjust to the other players team work values . A normal player 's ( that is not a diva ) team work value will after each played game move one step towards the average value of his/her team mates team work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not necessarily move the team work value in the right direction . The diva 's team work value stay at the same value or even move in the opposite direction . Eventually all players in a team will have about the same team work value but it will take a little longer for the diva to adjust to the others or in the case with the diva it will be more like the others adjusting to the diva . Read more about the team work values in the rules in the section about the match report . Also worth mentioning about offers from the agents is that the special quality diva is , only revealed if you evaluate the player . Also the diva icon is only visible for the team owner.Divas are very demanding and if given their favourite shirt number their performance will improve slightly . If they do not get their favourite number their performance will suffer a bit . <p> A player with this quality is more accurate delivering long passes and crosses . It also means the player is reasonably good at taking freekicks variations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goal . A freekick taker with this quality is equally good at set piece freekicks as " Powerful shot quality " is good at direct free kicks . It-s also a slight increase in chances being created from the wings when this player is involved in the scoring opportunity . <p> 5 special qualities for outfield players only A player with this symbol is a player like Ronald Koeman who can fire away excellent shots from outside the penalty area . This player thus performs at his/her best when having opportunities to shoot from a distance . A player with this quality is also reasonably good at taking freekicks as he/she can rely on his/her powerful shot . His/her capacity in taking freekicks is however 20% below that of a specialist and he/she is no good at freekick variations . A player with this quality can however be a good alternative to take freekicks if you have not got a specialist in your team . <p> Players with this symbol are very quick and can outpace most players . To be quick is good when alone against the goalkeeper but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ catch players that have broken away from the defence . A player with this quality will be slightly better than others at scoring when alone with the goalkeeper . <p> A player with this symbol is a good header of the ball and will dominate in the air . <p> Players with this symbol have a good sense of where the goal is and often end up in the right place at the right time . In other words they have goal instincts and are real goalpredators . Players with this quality are at their best in the penalty area . <p> Players with this symbol do n't get tired as much as other players during a match . How big the advantage for the players with this symbol depending on how the team is playing and what opponent they are facing . Stuff that makes players tired are chasing the ball , use of pressure and aggression . <p> 4 special qualities for goalkeepers only Goalkeepers with this symbol often position themselves well and are a little better at saving shots from a distance than other ways of scoring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on ones and often make the alone attacker 's legs tremble . They are better than other goalkeepers in stopping attackers who have broken away from the defence . <p> If a goalkeeper has this symbol he/she is good at catching high balls . This type of goalkeeper is thus good at defending against crosses . <p> Goalkeepers with this symbol have quick reactions and are good at saving shots from close range . They are thus better at saving shots from within the penalty area than other ways of scoring .

@@40870767 @870767/ <p> The leagues in Xpert Eleven are flexible in their make-up and the module that creates a league can handle different types of leagues regardless of the number of teams . The league system one should use depends on the number of teams and also on personal preferences . We recommend you spend some time thinking about what your league should look like . There are certain rules that always apply : <p> 1 ) The number of teams per series can never differ by more than one team . That is you can not have 10 teams in one series and only 8 in another . If your league contains 18 teams and you want it to have 2 divisions the only alternative is having 9 teams in each division . <p> 2 ) If the teams can not be evenly divided into the series the higher divisions will have an extra team . That is if your league contains 19 teams and you divide it into 2 divisions there will be 10 teams in the first division and 9 in the second . <p> 3 ) If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same and the largest number of teams in a series is an odd number that series will have 4 more rounds than those having one team less . Therefore one should avoid having a different number of teams in the series in a league if the larger number of teams is an odd number . <p> 4 ) One series must contain at least 6 teams . However in the CL-system 4 is enough . <p> The 1:1-system A league system based on the 1:1 model is a straight system where there is always one series in each division . The same number of teams are promoted as the number that are relegated from the division above . <p> The 1:2-system The 1:2-system is a pyramid like system where the number of series are doubled for each division . The number of promoted teams in a series is half the number of relegated teams in series in the division above . To use the 1:2-system the league must contain at least 18 active teams . <p> The 1:3-system The 1:3-system is similar to the 1:2-system but the number of series @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teams in a series is only a third of the number of relegated teams in series in the division above . To use the 1:3-system the league must contain at least 24 active teams . <p> The CL-system The CL-system is a straight system where the top division consists of a group phase where 8 teams advance to a playoff with quarterfinals , semi-finals and a final . If the league has at least 24 active teams you can choose to play a round of 16 as well . If you choose to play a round of 16 then 16 teams will advance to the playoff . Every round in the playoff is one legged and played on neutral ground . The ranking of the teams in the playoff is based on the points from the group stage . The team with most points plays against the team with least points and so on , this means that teams from the same group might face each other directly in the playoff as well . The CL-system can have underlying divisions in a straight system where the number of promoted teams @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the division above . To use the CL-system the league must contain at least 16 active teams . The CL-system is only available in leagues where the league admin is a VIP-member.

@@40870770 @870770/ <p> Every player in Xpert Eleven has a certain skill and form . Skill is the player 's basic capacity . The skill level generally stays the same during a season and after each season it is updated and can then be raised or lowered . The skill update at the end of a season depends a lot on a player 's form during the season . When selecting a team it is often better to choose a player in good form than a more skilled player in poor form . This is of course only true if the difference in skill is not too significant . <p> Age Player 's ages matter in so far as an older player can handle pressure better for example when taking a penalty . An older player also has a slight advantage during matches from having more experience . The disadvantage with older players is that they do not develop as much as younger players . At the skill update at the end of each season there is a greater risk of an older player lowering his/her skill level than a younger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increasing his/her skill . As players get older they have an increasing tendency to retire from the game , in general this does not happen before they reach thirty . At the season update each player becomes a year older . <p> Positions Every player prefers to play and performs best in a particular position in the team . For example , a defender playing in midfield will only perform at around 60% of his/her capacity and in goal will perform only around 20% . Goalkeepers only perform at 20 % of their capacity in all other positions . <p> Injuries A player can be injured and is then unavailable for a number of matches . Players with less than 5 days left of their injury time will be available to play . Injured players are shown with a red cross by their name on the squad page . Players who are only slightly injured will instead have an injection needle by their name and they are available for play but using a slightly injured player is risky because if he/she gets further injured he/she could be out for as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The risk of a slightly injured player getting injured again is also higher and at the same level as that for an injury prone player . On the player 's page you can see his/her injury stats in full . There all injuries will be listed along with how many injury days and in which game the player was injured . You can also see the total amount of injuries and injury days of a player . <p> Suspensions Players can also be unavailable for play because of suspension . If a player receives a red card during a competitive match he/she will generally be suspended for one match . If the incident is more serious it can lead to a suspension of up to 5 competitive matches . A player is also suspended if he/she receives three yellow cards during a season . A suspension due to yellow cards always results in a one match suspension . A suspension applies only to competitive matches , that is league and cup matches . A suspension in the league means that a player will miss the next competitive match even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also be made unavailable because of other reasons than injury and suspension . Unexpected events can occur that make a player miss one or a couple of matches . <p> Player face If you are VIP you have the possibility to edit the face of your players . On the player 's page you can choose to edit player face beneath the current player picture . <p> Other Every player is worth a certain amount of econ . The value is based on similar player sales the last 4 months . The areas involved when comparing are skill , age , special qualities , position and database the player belongs in . The player value can differ a lot from each day as it-s based on previous sales . An injured player lowers his/her value significantly . You can if you want try to sell a player . Read more about this in the section " Selling players " . If you do not manage to sell a player or if you do not have time to wait for offers you can fire the player and he/she will leave the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least 13 but no more than 23 players in the squad . You can not sell a player if you risk having less than 13 players and you can not buy a player if you already have 23 players . A player can only be fired if you have more than 15 players in the squad otherwise the club will not accept it . Also the club can stop the firing of players who are among the better players in the club and a player that is transfer listed and have bids on him can-t be fired . <p> On the player 's page there are 5 horizontal bars which stand for : 1 ) The player 's current skill level 2 ) The player 's current form 3 ) The player 's average form for the season 4 ) The player 's latest performance in a match 5 ) The player 's best performance ever in a match <p> The bars which graphically represent the player 's skill level , form and so on are not precise values . Within every step there are smaller steps which do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same skill level and form will not necessarily perform equally well . <p> Each player has a favourite shirt number and you can assign the player a number on the player 's page . Players with the diva quality are very demanding and will sulk and perform slightly worse if they do not receive their favourite number . <p> Match experience The players get match experience when they play matches and above all competitive matches . They will get some match experience when playing friendly matches also but only fractions of the match experience they get when playing competitive matches . The players also get different amount of match experience depending on which teammates that plays the same match . Older players get less match experience than younger players . Better players get less match experience than the poorer players . Also if the player does n't play in his regular position he/she will get less match experience . The latter is especially noticeable if it is a goalie playing outfield player or vice versa . Players with the special quality of being allround are not affected as much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get match experience not only from their team mates but also from their opponents . Especially the opponents playing in team parts that the player face most . In other words defenders will get most match experience from the opponents forwards etc . Goalkeepers will get 60% of the match experience from the opponents while the other players will get 40% of the match experience from the opponents . When it comes to the opponents their skill is more important than the age compared to when the players get match experience from team mates . <p> The match experience will together with the average form influence the player 's skill development at the season updates . The more match experience a player gets the better . <p> Development value The development value shown on the player 's page is a calculated value based on the player 's average form and match experience during the season . If the development value is more than 10 bars then the player will increase his skill at the season update . If it is below 10 bars then the player 's skill will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ available to VIP-members . Player name changes means that the league admin can activate player name changes for VIP-members in his league . If it-s activated , a user that is VIP and plays in the league can change the player name once of every player in his squad that hasn-t got history in any earlier club . The player name change application will be sent to the league admin and the name will be changed when the league admin accepts it . Note that player name changes isn-t activated in the Xpert Leagues nor the Xpert Ladies . <p> Sacking players You can only sack players if you have more than 15 players . If you have 15 or fewer , you can not sack anyone . This is to prevent the intentional destruction of teams by managers . If you have fewer players and wish to get rid of someone you will have to try to sell the player or wait until you have more players before deleting the unwanted player . <p> Players who are deemed by the system to have a decent value ca n't be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is no reason to simply sack the player and get nothing for it . If you want to get rid of such a player , you should try to sell the player to get some value back for their departure . <p> Player team work value Each player has a teamwork value . This value is used to determine how well the player interacts with the rest of the players in your team . The value is a number between 0 and 999 and the scale we use is circular . This means if one player has a teamwork value of 10 and another player has a teamwork value of 990 , their difference is 20 , not 980 . This implies that the furthest apart two players can be is 500 points . <p> Each individual team also has a team work value , which is the average value of all the players . The distance between a player 's teamwork value and the team 's teamwork value determines how settled the player is . To simplify and make it easier to see how compatible a player is compared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compatibility tuner . It shows the team average in the middle of the green field and then shifts towards red as the compatibility gets lower . The cursor can move both right and left from the average , which gives you the ability to compare and see which players are more or less compatible with each other . <p> The teamwork of your team will improve the more they play together . After each game that a player plays , his/her teamwork value will move towards the teams teamwork value . The further away from the team 's teamwork value a player is , the faster his/her teamwork value will move towards the team 's teamwork value . <p> This team work value is also used on the transfer market . So we recommend you to evaluate players you are about to buy to see how well a possible new player will fit into your team . The recommended players you get in the mailbox will always have at least good compatibility with your team and talents will always comes to the club with at least a fair compatibility .

The average age should be between 25 and 29 years for the team or team part to be able to perform at its best . If the average age is lower than 25 years then the team/team part will suffer from a performance reduction due to having too little routine/experience . The lower the average age is the bigger the performance reduction will be . If the team/team part instead would have a average age above 29 years then it would suffer from a performance reduction due to the lack of hunger .

@@40870772 @870772/ <p> One of the most important tasks for the league admin is to start a new season in his/her league . It can perhaps be seen as a little bit complicated but it is actually not that difficult . It can however be a good idea to spend a little time thinking about what your league should look like . You find the link to " Start a new season " in the left hand menu on the league info page which you reach by choosing the menu alternative " League info " in the fixed left hand menu when logged on to a league . This link will not be visible if your league contains less than 6 teams or if a season is on-going . When a season ends in your league and the season update has taken place the link will be visible again . <p> When you start a new season in your league you should think about the following points : <p> Has everyone you want in your league joined it ? You should not start a new season until everybody you want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Once you have started a season no one new can normally join the league until the season ends at that can take months . If you realize you have started the season too early there is nothing you can do about it as it can not be undone . <p> How often should league matches be played ? You can choose whether league matches should be played once or twice a week . Think about what the members in your league might prefer . It does not have to take much time to play Xpert Eleven but 2 matches a week might still be too much for some . For most people however 2 matches a week is probably just right . You must also keep in mind that if you choose 2 league matches a week you can not have a cup tournament in the league . Only if you play 1 league match a week is there room for a cup tournament . <p> Should everyone play in one big series or should the league be divided into divisions.If your league contains 12 or more teams you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The more teams a series contains the longer the season will last . There is no upper limit to the number of teams one series can have but we here at Xpert Eleven recommend about 8 teams per series . <p> If you have several divisions , what league system should be usedIf your league contains 18 teams or more you have to think about what system to use . The alternatives are a straight system ( 1:1 ) or a pyramid like system ( 1:2 ) . In a straight system each division contains one series . In a pyramid system of the 1:2 kind the number of series double for each division , that is the number of series in one division is double that of the division above . There is also a 1:3 pyramid system where the number of series treble for each division but this should only be used in large leagues . If the league admin is a VIP-member and the league contains at least 16 teams you can also choose the CL-system which includes a group stage followed by playoffs . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? If you choose more than one division you have to decide on how many teams are relegated and promoted . We at Xpert Eleven recommend having at least two teams relegated per series . On the page where you fill in your choices you will se how they affect the number of teams in each series and the length of the season . A recommendation is if " Maximum number of teams/series " differs from " minimum number of teams/series " then try to see that the maximum number is an even number . Otherwise some series will last 4 rounds longer than others . You can of course have it this way but you should be aware of this effect . <p> What name should be given to the top division ? You can choose to give the top division a special name . If you choose not to it will be given the same name as the league itself . <p> Inactive teams are deleted at the start of a seasonWhen creating a new season it will only contain active teams so any inactive teams in your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important to go through the list of members and check that all teams you want to remain in the league are active .

A process is then triggered which creates a new season in your league . There is quite a lot to be carried out especially if your league has lot of teams . It can therefore take a few seconds before all is done . To make it easier for the system it is good if you try to start a season at a time when there is not so much traffic on the site . When the system has created the new season you will be forwarded to the league table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first round to begin . You should perhaps inform the other members that a new season has been created and when it will start . <p> It may seem difficult to be a league admin but the fact is that most things are done automatically . The only major task is starting a new season and the first time you do this you are provided with a ready made suggestion of what your league could look like . You can make your own choices or just accept this suggestion and click the " Start season " button and that 's all . The next time you start a season the same settings you used for the last season will be used again unless you decide to change them of course .

But once the player is turning 29 then the player may consider to retire if he/she has received too little match experience during the past season . Players older than 33 may retire no matter how much match experience they have received during the past season . But how much match experience a player has received during the past season will always reduce the probability for a player to retire . <p> Every time you try to sell a player he/she will consider if he wants to end his career in the current club . This means that the player wo n't end his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does n't want to change clubs . He will play in your club as long as you want him , but you wo n't be able to sell him . The player might still decide to retire in the future though , but it wo n't be related to whether you have tried to sell him or not . <p> Skill level update When a player 's skill level changes the form changes in the opposite way . That is if a player 's skill level increases his/her form gets worse and vice versa . The change in form does not change a player 's actual capacity only how well he/she uses it . There is also a normal form update at the season update which makes it difficult to know exactly how much the skill level has changed by just studying the change in form . <p> When it comes to skill it is important to realize that the skill level you see is not the player 's exact skill but a value that has been rounded off to the nearest whole number . So if a player has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 6,50 . This means a player can lower/raise his/her skill level quite a lot without it showing in the number of skillboxes and also that only a slight change in skill level can affect the number of skillboxes . <p> A form notation is a recording of a player 's form at a point in time . A form notation is made when a player joins the team , at the season update , whenever a competetive match is played ( whether or not a player participated in the match ) . ( Previous to Feb. 1 , 2008 , a notation was made when a form training was completed , but this has been removed under the changes instituted that day . ) Each form notation is used to compute the player 's average form . So if a player had notations of 10 , 12 , 14 , 12 , 10 and 8 , the player 's average form would be 11. ( 10+12+14+12+10+8 ) /6=11 <p> What decides if a player raises his/her skill level or not is the player 's development value and his/her age . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whole season will raise their skill level and those with an development value below 10 will lower their skill level . The higher the development value the more the skill level will be raised and vice versa . Be aware of that the development value is rounded so a development value of 10 could mean that the player 's skill level can go either way . Younger players tend to do better in the skill level updates and raise their skill level more as well as lower their skill level less than older players . ( Older players with a development value above 10 might not always increase their skill , their skill could remain unchanged dependant on their age and development value . ) Read more about this in the section on the player and his/her form . <p> The development value is a calculated value that consists on the player 's average form and match experience during the season . <p> Time at the club Another thing that 's important if you want a player to reach full development during a season is the so called time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been at the club for the entire season will reach full development . A player who 's bought a couple of games in will not reach full development . If you for example bought a player after half the season he or she will only receive half the development a player bought during the silly season or who 's been at the club since last season would . This reduction is included in the Developmental Value displayed for a player . It 's important to note that this does not affect talents from the youth team . They count as original players regardless on when they arrived during the season and are thus not affected by time at the club .

There is shown amongst other things the team you are playing against , the time of the match and who the referee will be . As well as the name of the referee you see his/her S- and H- values where the S-value represents his/her skill level and the H-value how hard he/she is . It is not easy to try to cheat when the referee is highly skilled and such referees are also better at judging offsides than those less skilled . If a referee has a high H-value it means he/she is very strict and will not tolerate the slightest offence . <p> Style of play : When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ style of play which determines how the team will behave when they have the ball . If you choose to play defensive the team will take few risks and will try to keep hold of the ball when they get it . Defensive play has the disadvantage of not creating so many scoring opportunities but hopefully neither will your opponents . If you choose to play offensive the whole team will go forward and you will probably create a fair number of scoring opportunities but the disadvantage is that your defence will not be so tight which will give your opponents more scoring opportunities also . <p> Offensive strategy This tactical option let 's you decide how the team will behave in the last third of the pitch . The alternatives you can choose between are : <p> 1 ) VariedThe team plays as it usually does and will try to attack on the wings , with through balls and long range shots . This tactic thus means the team will play a regular game . <p> 2 ) Through playsIf you choose this strategy the team will try to hit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you have fast attackers and your opponent 's defenders are not so fast and their goalkeeper is not very good against a lone attacker who has broken away from the defence . <p> 3 ) Wing playsIf you use this strategy your team will try playing down the wings and cross the ball in towards the penalty area . This tactic can be good if your attackers are good headers of the ball and your opponent 's goalkeeper is no good at catching high balls . <p> 4 ) Long shotsThis can be a good tactic if you have players who are good at shooting from outside the penalty area and the opponent 's goalkeeper does not position him/herself well . <p> Defensive strategy This choice of tactics let 's you decide how your defenders defend the area around the penalty box . The alternatives you can choose between are : <p> 1 ) NormalEverything is as usual and you leave no more space on the wings than in the middle . <p> 2 ) Tighten the wingsIf you think your opponent is going to try to play a lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your defenders concentrate on defending the wings thereby preventing the opponents from crossing the ball in . This means that your central defence will be weaker and make you more vulnerable against through balls and breakaways . <p> 3 ) Tighten the centreIf you think your opponent will use through plays or go for long shots it can be a good idea to concentrate on defending the centre . This means your defence will be weaker on the wings and you will be more vulnerable against a team attacking down the wings . <p> Defend against formation You are able to prepare your team for how your opponent will play . If you think your opponent will play 4-4-2 you will be able to choose to prepare your team for that by selecting that formation in a dropdown list on the tactics page . The tactical option is possible to save within the default tactics . <p> If your opponent uses that formation this will have a negative effect on your opponent 's ability to create chances . How much effect it will have depends on how accustomed your opponent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the formations used by your opponent the last 3 matches ( including friendlies ) . The more matches ( out of the past 3 matches ) the opponent has played with a certain formation , the better he will be at playing that formation . <p> In other words this means that if the opponent uses a formation that he has used before and you did n't prepare for that formation then your opponent will get a boost in his ability to create chances . <p> If you choose to prepare your team for a formation that the opponent wo n't use , then your opponent will always get a small positive extra effect on their ability to create chances . If you choose not to prepare your team for any formation then your opponent wo n't get any extra positive effect other than the experience they have on their formation used in the match . <p> Aggression : By aggression we mean how aggressively your players behave on the pitch . You can tell them to play hard and they will then tackle hard and some times even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you are lucky perhaps your opponent 's best player will be injured . The disadvantage is that your players will more likely get booked or even sent off and also your opponent will probably get more freekicks and perhaps penalties . It is also tiring playing this hard so your team will lose some steam towards the end of each half . If you instead tell your players to play carefully they will not tackle very hard but the team will perform slightly worse than usual . The advantages are that your team will not be giving away so many freekicks or penalties or get any unnecessary yellow or red cards . Furthermore playing a careful game will lower the risk slightly of your players getting injured since they will not tackle so hard while playing hard increases the risks of injuries . When you choose how aggressively your team is going to play you should check who the referee will be . If the referee is hard ( a high H-value ) you should avoid playing to agressively , you might even want to tell your players to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to many freekicks or even penalties . In friendly games you can not choose aggression , everyone plays carefully . <p> Team captain : The player you choose as team captain should be the most respected player in the team . He/she should have his heart in the club , be amongst the most skilled and preferably a leader type . Look at the players visual skill level , you can ignore his/her form . When choosing the captain you can subtract 3 from the skill level if a player has not got his/her heart in the club and you can add 2 if a player is a leader type . If you still have 2 evenly matched players it is best to choose the leader type . A leader will perform at his/her best as team captain and get the whole team behind him/her . To choose a player who is not respected by the others is bad for the team . Note however that chosing a captain is the least important of all the tactical choices . <p> You are able to choose who you want as your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 20th choice . If you save a list , it will be used for all future matches as long as you don-t change and save a new player manually in the dropdownlist for a specific game . If your number 1 choice is injured or unavailable the next player in list will take the role . <p> Playmaker : If you have a good midfielder it might be a good idea to choose him/her as a playmaker and let most of the play go through him/her . His/her skill will then carry more weight than that of the other midfielders and give the team more attacking power . There is though a risk that the opponents choose to mark him/her closely and in that case the playmaker 's skill will carry less weight than that of the other midfielders . <p> Freekick taker : In the scrolling list you choose the player you want to take the freekicks . If you do not choose someone particular then the team captain will take care of the freekicks . A good taker of freekicks should have a lot of experience . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ penalties but you should not choose a teenager for this task . Furthermore the more skilled a player is and the better his/her form is the better he/she will be at taking freekicks . When choosing the freekick taker you should also take in account if the player has the special quality for freekicks or if he/she has the special quality of great power in his shots . Read more about those special qualities in the section about special qualities . . <p> You are able to choose who you want as your first choice of freekick taker and all the way down to the 20th choice . If you save a list , it will be used for all future matches as long as you don-t change and save a new player manually in the dropdownlist for a specific game . If your number 1 choice is injured or unavailable the next player in list will take the role . <p> Penalty taker : When taking penalties experience is very important . A penalty taker should also be quite skilled and in good form . <p> You are able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ penalty taker and all the way down to the 20th choice . If you save a list , it will be used for all future matches as long as you don-t change and save a new player manually in the dropdownlist for a specific game . If your number 1 choice is injured or unavailable the next player in list will take the role . This list is also used when a competitive game ends in a penalty shoot-out . <p> Closely mark : If your opponent happens to have a top class player who might dominate the match it can be a good idea to mark him/her closely . The closely marked player will not get as much space as he/she is used to and will therefore create less scoring opportunities and score less goals . Your players will also tackle him/her a bit harder increasing the probability of him/her being injured but this increase is very small . The probability of injuries in your opponent 's team as a whole does not increase . The disadvantage with this tactic is of course that the other players in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better than usual . If the player you were going to closely mark does not start the match everything will be as normal . <p> Win bonus : You can motivate your players to perform better by promising bonus money for winning . The more money you promise the better they will perform in the match . You must have enough money to cover it at the start of the match or the effect will be the opposite . The sum is a lump sum which is paid out to the whole team so you do not pay each player individually the stated amount . If the team wins the whole sum is paid out and if they draw only a quarter of the sum is paid out . If the team loses nothing is paid out . In cup matches played over 2 legs the money in the second leg is paid out only if you advance . Bonus money is not included in the standard tactics . <p> Substitute slightly injured : You are able to choose if you want players that gets slightly injured during the match @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a simple Yes/No-choice where No is the default . Using a slightly injured player involves the risk of the player getting another injury which in that case would lead to a severe injury . A slightly injured player is completely fit and healthy within 4 days . <p> Long balls : If you choose to play long balls you will lessen the importance of the midfield for you and your opponent . This tactic can be useful when your opponents 's midfield is very strong . If you yourself are playing with a lot of midfielders you should avoid this tactic . <p> Pressure : By putting pressure on the holder of the ball you will strengthen your midfield which should increase your possession of the ball . Your opponent will also have difficulty in finding opportunities to shoot from outside the penalty area . In other word this tactic can be good if you think your opponent will try a lot of shots from outside the penalty area but the disadvantage is that your players will get tired towards the end of each half especially in the second half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Offside traps : If you tell your defenders to use offside traps they will leave the opponents in offside positions most of the time but when they fail your opponents will break away from the defence and have a good chance of scoring . When the referee is not very skilled ( low S-value ) he is not very good at judging offsides and if he is not very hard ( low H-value ) he might allow some offsides you think are obvious . Playing with offside traps will make it harder for your opponents to create scoring opportunities but the chances they have will instead be more dangerous . <p> Cheating : To tell your players to cheat and try to gain advantages means that you practically are telling them to dive , pull the opponent 's shirts and generally act unsportsmanly . You can gain from this tactic if you use it in a match with the " right " type of referee . A low skilled ( low S-value ) referee has difficulty in judging what is cheating and what is not and if he/she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ penalties by cheating or perhaps get one of your opponent 's players sent off . Your defence will also be able to perform a bit better when they can pull the shirts of the opponent 's players . But be very careful of using this tactic in a match with a skilled referee ecspecially if he also is hard in his judgements because then you might give away a lot of freekicks and even penalties and also risk having your own players sent off . <p> When you have chosen your tactics you press the " Save tactics " button to save them . If you check " Save as default " they will be saved as the new standard .

@@40870792 @870792/ <p> All players have a current form and an average form . The form varies between 0 and 20 with 0 the lowest , 20 the highest and 10 the norm . Note that the form bars you see do not show exact form but a value rounded off to the nearest whole number . The higher the player 's form the better he/she will perform during matches . If his/her form is below 10 he/she will perform below his/her normal capacity and if it is above 10 he/she will perform above his/her normal capacity . <p> The form decides how the player 's skill will developAfter each season players are updated and their skill level can be raised or lowered . This depends a lot on their average form over the whole season . A player who has been in good form during most of the season has a greater chance of having his/her skill level raised than a player who has been in poorer form who instead is at greater risk of having his skill level lowered . In other words form is relatively important . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a player in good form ahead of a more skilled player in poor form . This is of course only true if the difference in skill is not too significant . <p> Players will have their skill level raised or lowered between seasons depending on their average form over the whole season . Therefore it can be good to try and keep your players in good form and to do this they need to be playing matches and you can also order individual form training for a player . <p> What affects the formA player 's form will as mentioned above also depend on how well he/she performs in a particular match . For example , a goalkeeper will raise his form if he/she makes a lot of good saves but his/her form will be lowered if he/she let 's in a lot of goals . Defenders will raise their form if they do not give the opponents too many scoring chances . Midfielders will raise their form if they create a lot of scoring chances . Attackers will raise their form if the team often scores when having the opportunity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ missed opportunity to score will lower the form slightly especially for an attacker . A player who misses a penalty will also lower his/her form slightly whilst the goalkeeper who saves it will raise his/her form . There are in other words a lot of things that can affect form . In addition to this the normal form update will also be a big factor when it comes to form changes . Read more about these below . <p> How the form changes are calculated Increases in form are always percentage of the form the player does n't have and form reductions are always percentage of the form the player has . The maximum form is 20 form bars so if the player has a current form of 18 then it is 2 form bars that the player does n't have . This means that increases in form will be smaller the higher current form the player has and form reductions will be bigger the higher current form the player has . As a result of this the player 's form will tend to go towards the norm . Read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is also good to know that players ' form is always drawn towards the norm , which is 10 . This means for a player in good form further increases will be smaller while reductions will be larger and the opposite is true for players in poor form . You can liken it to a rubber band hooked on 10 form bars making it harder to stretch the further away from normal form it is . <p> The norm is not the same for all players . As the player gets older ( 30+ ) the rubber band is hooked at a lower form proportional to the players age . This means that a player who is 35 years old will have a form norm on around 5-6 form bars instead of 10 which is the norm for players in their 20s . Very young players will instead have a norm over 10 form bars which means that they will easier contain a great form . <p> Average form Every time a player 's form is updated the player will get a new form status . The average form the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ player has had after each competitive match during the current season . The average form is important because it along with match experience forms the basis for the development value that is deciding the skill level update which takes place at the season update . Therefore it is important to try and keep the players in as good form as possible especially the younger players since they have a greater potential of raising their skill level than older players have . If the player have had too low form and/or played too few matches during the season the may reduce their skill level . Read more about this in the section about the season update . <p> The hidden form tendency and the normal form updates A player 's form is influenced by a hidden form tendency which every player has . If this tendency is on its way down the player 's form will be drawn downwards and vice versa . The form also depends on how players perform in matches . Players ' form is updated before every match . The hidden form tendency affects the direction in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a player 's current form as well as a random factor . <p> The hidden form tendency decides the direction of the form change at the normal form updates before each match . If a player has a negative form tendency his/her form will be drawn downwards and vice versa . The hidden form tendency is , as its name suggests , hidden and you can not see it . It can change at regular form updates but can also change at special events for example during matches . A player in good form will more easily get a negative form tendency than a player in poor form . A player in poor form will more easily get a positive form tendency than a player in good form . It is however always more likely that the form tendency remains unchanged . The form trend for a player can turn to positive through form training . There are no guarantees but the chances are good it will happen and they are greater the poorer the form of the player .

The Cup of Champions works whereby each tier is split in two .

It creates some interesting turning points and allows new managers the chance to progress their players quickly in order to catch up with the older and experienced LOC members .
