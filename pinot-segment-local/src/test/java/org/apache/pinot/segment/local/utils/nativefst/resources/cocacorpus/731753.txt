The hardtop sides of the bracket ( 3 holes ) are drilled slightly elongated side to side allowing perfect fitment while the Chassis side ( 2 holes ) are elongated up and down to allow you to push/pull the hardtop snug before fully tightening the bolts . I 'd suggest ordering the fitting kit or buying stainless hardware vice reusing the factory bolts as the top latches use red/blue locktite and may have stripped heads after removing them .

@@83965978 @5465978/ <h> Tag : Autocross <p> We have n't heard many people complain about how good the Miata is on a twisty road . Its FR layout with the engine placed in front of the driver , but behind the front wheels , combined with its extremely lightweight body and low center of gravity make it one of the most interesting driver 's cars , despite having relatively low power rating . For example , we have recently seen what Miata can do in capable hands . One of the small number of things that Miata had upgraded is suspension and the upgrade came in the form of coilovers . <h> Why the coilovers are the way to go ? <p> First of all , we have to say that the impeccable blend of comfort and performance of the stock suspension on the Miata does the job perfectly well for everyday use . Upgrading them would make the car noticeably more capable on the track and many people opt to do so for the fun of it . However , if you decide to add more power " by adding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are no longer an additional perk , but rather a necessity . <p> There are more advanced ways of improving your suspension . The top notch ones would be air suspension , or some hydraulic systems . They are usually used on the most luxurious of cars and they offer the best adaptability . Luxury cars use them for comfort , but they can also be used to bag the cars " make them as low as possible . Whenever you see a bagged car , it most likely has air suspension . <p> The problem with air suspension is that it is incredibly expensive to buy and almost as expensive to maintain and service . Lastly , despite the diversity of options , the main purpose of air suspension is comfort , so most of them are not meant to be used as rugged , track-oriented systems . <p> If you want great versatility of settings and sporty ruggedness , go for coilovers . Even though they are noticeably cheaper than air suspension , they are also more expensive than regular sports shocks and springs . However , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worth it . <h> What are they ? <p> They are a mixture of a coil spring and a shock in one unit . There are several different kinds , including the ones that give you the option of adjusting the height of the car . The installation process for the Miata is a DIY job and a pretty straightforward one . Furthermore , most coilovers will fit the car , so you should n't have a problem with finding the set that is just perfect for your desires and budget . <p> A short video of Jason Fenske explaining how do coilovers work . ( these coilovers are for Integra , but the principle is the same ) : <h> Installation process <p> First of all , a little trick of the trade . If you are not an experienced mechanic and if you have n't observed the suspension on your Miata often , you should take pictures of the parts BEFORE you remove them from the car . There are loads of parts and if you are not familiar with them , you might have problems remembering where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , even though it is a simple task generally speaking . Make sure you know where everything should be and in which order . Explaining why losing any of the parts is not a good idea is probably not necessary . <h> Front coilovers installation <p> Step 1 Remove the front wheels to gain access to the brake line bracket bolt . That one is located on the strut body and even though you wo n't do anything with it immediately , doing this first will make things a lot easier later . <p> Step 2 This one is optional , but we would strongly recommend it . You should disconnect the sway bar from the link . Just remove the bolt and the nut and the sway bar should be released . This will give you more manoeuvring space and it will make things easier and safer and it is as easy as can be . It is optional , but there is literally no reason not to do it . <p> Step 3 Behind the disc brake you will find a nut and a bolt . These connect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Step 4 Remove the plastic trim that hides the engine . Do not pull it if you feel it 's stuck , since this probably means you have n't undone all of the bolts . Pulling it might break it and you do n't want that . Remove all of the bolts ( two per wheel well and a few more on the underside ) and the trim should come right off . <p> Step 5 Removing the trim will give you access to the bolt and nut that keep the upper control arm attached . This bolt is longer than the others . Undoing it will disconnect the upper control arm . <p> Step 6 Get yourself under the hood and undo the two nuts in the strut tower . Completely removing these enables you to remove the strut with ease , since these two nuts connect the top side of the strut to the strut tower . <p> Step 7 First of all , connect the strut to your spring compressor . After that , remove the nut that keeps the top mount connected to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ connected to the coilover after you remove it from the strut . While you are connecting the top mount and the coilover , make sure all of the parts are put in the right order . This is especially important for the parts that go between the spring and the top mount . Some types of coilovers might have more parts than others , but for each of them you should make sure that all of the parts are in the intended order . This should not be difficult , but it is paramount . <p> Step 9 Connect the mount and the coilover and make sure they are n't loose . <p> Step 10 Put the coilover in the wheel well and guide the studs of the top mount through the intended spaces in the strut tower . Tighten the two nuts at the top of the strut tower . These are the two nuts you removed from under the hood in the Step 6 . <p> Step 11 This is a combination of the first few steps in the reverse order . This is basically putting everything back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a ) Connect the upper control arm by using the long bolt . Make sure everything is in its original place , including the two washers . <p> b ) - Connect the lower control arm . <p> c ) Attach the sway bar to the link . <p> d ) Attach the bracket at the brake line <p> e ) Reinstall the plastic trim and do n't forget any of the bolts . Start from the underside . <p> f ) Put the wheel back <p> Repeat the steps for the other side of the front . <h> Rear coilovers installation <p> The process is pretty much the same , so I 'll just address the slight differences and give a quick rundown . <p> Step 1 After the rear wheels have been detached and removed , disconnect the sway bar . <p> Step 2 Undo the bolt that connects the control arm and the strut . <p> Step 3 Remove the carpet in the boot to access the top mounts for the rear wheels . <p> Step 4 Remove the metal cover that stands over the fuel line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and once you get to it , remove the two nuts . If you ca n't reach the nuts , do not use excessive force around the fuel lines . Rather use an extension . <p> Step 6 Upon removing the nuts , you will be able to pull the hub downwards and disconnect the shock . <p> Step 7 Remove the mount using the compressor and install it on the coilover just like you did for the front . <p> Step 8 Tighten the coilover top mount to the strut tower and reinstall the metal cover and then the carpet you removed earlier . <p> Step 9 Connect the lower part of the shock to the hub . <p> Step 10 Attach the sway bar and put the rear wheels back in their place . <p> That 's it . If you have any questions or suggestions , make sure you post them in the comment section and remember what you use your suspension for . You must be concentrated and very careful , since one loosely tightened bolt could cause serious issues . <p> Yeah , you 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or , some would say , even slightly modified Miata on the N++rburgring Nordschleife lapping the famed course in under 8 minutes , which is amazing in itself . Then add the fact that the driver was by no means alone on the track and that it was covered with more or less egoistic traffic , aptly called obstacles ' in the video title . Among the mentioned obstacles ' , you can also find several respectable cars whose power ratings and track credentials greatly surpass those of our beloved Miatas on paper . Just some of them are a Subaru Impreza , several sporty hot hatches ( OK , they are not better than the MX-5 ) , a sporty BMW 3 Series coupe and three Porsche 911s , all of which end up behind the Miata . Now , one of those Porsches is the 997 991 GT3 RS " a proper track beast which , in spite of being street legal , is one of the most capable track cars in the world , having even been entered into official endurance races such as the 2010 24 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incredible driving , but knowing what and who is behind it will show you just how incredible the whole thing is . Let 's start with our human hero . <p> THE DRIVER The man , or the beast , behind the wheel is Robert Serwanski , a 28-year-old Swede who works as a test driver at Koenigsegg . Before this employment he was racing in the Mazda MX-5 Cup Sweden and killing it there as well , winning the cup twice and in his last year there having 7 podiums out of 8 races , including 5 wins . It is an understatement to say that he knows how to drive , so it is no wonder thatChristian von Koenigsegg has put enough trust in him to pay him to test drive some of the fastest cars in the world . However , despite enjoying the beastly Koenigseggs on a daily basis , Serwanski obviously has n't forgotten his MX-5 . <p> THE OPPONENT We do n't know who the driver of the other car is and it is not very likely that he will make himself known to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all petrolheads . The 997 991 GT3 RS is a high-performance version of the already high-performing Porsche 911 , primarily aimed at racing . The GT3 models are thought to be made pretty much for homologation purposes and their production numbers are comparably low . They are powerful , lightweight , tuned for racing and pretty spartan , being devoid of weight-adding comfort perks . The added RS means that the car is even lighter and more powerful and that it packs a wider rear end for better looks , but also improved stability . This is what a street legal race car is . Moreover , the 997 generation has zero lift ' aerodynamics , track modified , electronically adjustable PASM suspension , dynamic engine mounts and loooads of other track-oriented perks . They are so apt for racing that they regularly beat other Porsches that have even more power , but are left with more comfort perks and more comfortable suspension settings . Speaking of the power , there have been two different H6 engines in the facelifted GT3 RS ( which the one in the video is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ providing the car with 450 hp or 500 hp to play with . Both versions provide the acceleration to 100 km/h ( 62 mph ) of about 3.5 seconds ( often thought to be pretty conservative , with several independent tests proving better times ) and top out at 311 km/h ( 193 mph ) . Just so much faster ( and comparably more expensive ) than the MX-5 NC . So , how did Serwanski obliterate the car that is 50% faster than his own ? <p> THE VIDEO He is just that good ! Plus , he obviously loves driving the Miata ( something we can all agree on ) . From his own words , prior to this ride , he had lapped the N++rburgring Nordschleife about 100 times , which is a cool way to get to know the track . However , it is not too many , especially when you have in mind that the track is more than 20km long . We can see his perfect cornering technique , impeccable line choices , incredible balance and ice-cold composure best seen during those scary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nordschleife is packed with . Just look at the way he enters the curves at top speed after the starting-line straight starting from the 3-minute mark . As for the GT3 RS , it has to be annoying when you see an MX-5 pressing in from behind and knowing the power and other capabilities difference . You can see the GT3 flying by with ease while Serwanski is driving as fast as the car can go on the straight at 2:40 . The Porsche driver was braking a lot earlier and probably the best driving lesson in this video can be seen in the differences in the path choices between the two drivers in the durable sections when the Porsche is just in front of Serwanski ( and stubbornly refusing to let him pass , despite all codes of conduct in such cases ) . It is also interesting to see how Serwanski applies the brakes in the red bar , as well as when he applies full throttle at the exits of curves . It is remarkable how rarely we can hear the tires squeal , which tells us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well , everything else in that MX-5 . Mind you , the driver of the Porsche is by no means a bad one and he is most definitely not willingly letting Serwanski overtake him . After seeing this lap I have to wonder what the Miata can do when alone on the track and devoid of slowing down so as not to hit the other cars or picking less effective trajectories for the same reason . Hats off for Mr. Serwanski !

@@83966087 @5466087/ <h> Tag : VMAXX Coilovers <p> We have n't heard many people complain about how good the Miata is on a twisty road . Its FR layout with the engine placed in front of the driver , but behind the front wheels , combined with its extremely lightweight body and low center of gravity make it one of the most interesting driver 's cars , despite having relatively low power rating . For example , we have recently seen what Miata can do in capable hands . One of the small number of things that Miata had upgraded is suspension and the upgrade came in the form of coilovers . <h> Why the coilovers are the way to go ? <p> First of all , we have to say that the impeccable blend of comfort and performance of the stock suspension on the Miata does the job perfectly well for everyday use . Upgrading them would make the car noticeably more capable on the track and many people opt to do so for the fun of it . However , if you decide to add more power " by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suspension are no longer an additional perk , but rather a necessity . <p> There are more advanced ways of improving your suspension . The top notch ones would be air suspension , or some hydraulic systems . They are usually used on the most luxurious of cars and they offer the best adaptability . Luxury cars use them for comfort , but they can also be used to bag the cars " make them as low as possible . Whenever you see a bagged car , it most likely has air suspension . <p> The problem with air suspension is that it is incredibly expensive to buy and almost as expensive to maintain and service . Lastly , despite the diversity of options , the main purpose of air suspension is comfort , so most of them are not meant to be used as rugged , track-oriented systems . <p> If you want great versatility of settings and sporty ruggedness , go for coilovers . Even though they are noticeably cheaper than air suspension , they are also more expensive than regular sports shocks and springs . However , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than worth it . <h> What are they ? <p> They are a mixture of a coil spring and a shock in one unit . There are several different kinds , including the ones that give you the option of adjusting the height of the car . The installation process for the Miata is a DIY job and a pretty straightforward one . Furthermore , most coilovers will fit the car , so you should n't have a problem with finding the set that is just perfect for your desires and budget . <p> A short video of Jason Fenske explaining how do coilovers work . ( these coilovers are for Integra , but the principle is the same ) : <h> Installation process <p> First of all , a little trick of the trade . If you are not an experienced mechanic and if you have n't observed the suspension on your Miata often , you should take pictures of the parts BEFORE you remove them from the car . There are loads of parts and if you are not familiar with them , you might have problems remembering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nightmare , even though it is a simple task generally speaking . Make sure you know where everything should be and in which order . Explaining why losing any of the parts is not a good idea is probably not necessary . <h> Front coilovers installation <p> Step 1 Remove the front wheels to gain access to the brake line bracket bolt . That one is located on the strut body and even though you wo n't do anything with it immediately , doing this first will make things a lot easier later . <p> Step 2 This one is optional , but we would strongly recommend it . You should disconnect the sway bar from the link . Just remove the bolt and the nut and the sway bar should be released . This will give you more manoeuvring space and it will make things easier and safer and it is as easy as can be . It is optional , but there is literally no reason not to do it . <p> Step 3 Behind the disc brake you will find a nut and a bolt . These @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . <p> Step 4 Remove the plastic trim that hides the engine . Do not pull it if you feel it 's stuck , since this probably means you have n't undone all of the bolts . Pulling it might break it and you do n't want that . Remove all of the bolts ( two per wheel well and a few more on the underside ) and the trim should come right off . <p> Step 5 Removing the trim will give you access to the bolt and nut that keep the upper control arm attached . This bolt is longer than the others . Undoing it will disconnect the upper control arm . <p> Step 6 Get yourself under the hood and undo the two nuts in the strut tower . Completely removing these enables you to remove the strut with ease , since these two nuts connect the top side of the strut to the strut tower . <p> Step 7 First of all , connect the strut to your spring compressor . After that , remove the nut that keeps the top mount connected to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be connected to the coilover after you remove it from the strut . While you are connecting the top mount and the coilover , make sure all of the parts are put in the right order . This is especially important for the parts that go between the spring and the top mount . Some types of coilovers might have more parts than others , but for each of them you should make sure that all of the parts are in the intended order . This should not be difficult , but it is paramount . <p> Step 9 Connect the mount and the coilover and make sure they are n't loose . <p> Step 10 Put the coilover in the wheel well and guide the studs of the top mount through the intended spaces in the strut tower . Tighten the two nuts at the top of the strut tower . These are the two nuts you removed from under the hood in the Step 6 . <p> Step 11 This is a combination of the first few steps in the reverse order . This is basically putting everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> a ) Connect the upper control arm by using the long bolt . Make sure everything is in its original place , including the two washers . <p> b ) - Connect the lower control arm . <p> c ) Attach the sway bar to the link . <p> d ) Attach the bracket at the brake line <p> e ) Reinstall the plastic trim and do n't forget any of the bolts . Start from the underside . <p> f ) Put the wheel back <p> Repeat the steps for the other side of the front . <h> Rear coilovers installation <p> The process is pretty much the same , so I 'll just address the slight differences and give a quick rundown . <p> Step 1 After the rear wheels have been detached and removed , disconnect the sway bar . <p> Step 2 Undo the bolt that connects the control arm and the strut . <p> Step 3 Remove the carpet in the boot to access the top mounts for the rear wheels . <p> Step 4 Remove the metal cover that stands over the fuel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it and once you get to it , remove the two nuts . If you ca n't reach the nuts , do not use excessive force around the fuel lines . Rather use an extension . <p> Step 6 Upon removing the nuts , you will be able to pull the hub downwards and disconnect the shock . <p> Step 7 Remove the mount using the compressor and install it on the coilover just like you did for the front . <p> Step 8 Tighten the coilover top mount to the strut tower and reinstall the metal cover and then the carpet you removed earlier . <p> Step 9 Connect the lower part of the shock to the hub . <p> Step 10 Attach the sway bar and put the rear wheels back in their place . <p> That 's it . If you have any questions or suggestions , make sure you post them in the comment section and remember what you use your suspension for . You must be concentrated and very careful , since one loosely tightened bolt could cause serious issues . <p> The suspension you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affect your Miata handling together with the look of your ride . If you 're looking to replace a worn suspension , improve your roadster 's handling , or to just get low , coilovers are the way to go for improved performance , adjustability and ride comfort . <p> There are several brands , styles , and setups out there , and the question is always which kit is the best route to go for . Before you decide and spend a fortune on a new suspension , or pick-up some of the cheapest coilovers on eBay , it 's always wise to do your homework and make sure the coilover kit you 're getting fits what you 're trying to achieve with your MX-5 , a Daily Driver , Stance , Track or even Autocross , the most expensive kit is not always going to be the best option for you .

@@83966100 @5466100/ <h> Tag : performance <p> We have n't heard many people complain about how good the Miata is on a twisty road . Its FR layout with the engine placed in front of the driver , but behind the front wheels , combined with its extremely lightweight body and low center of gravity make it one of the most interesting driver 's cars , despite having relatively low power rating . For example , we have recently seen what Miata can do in capable hands . One of the small number of things that Miata had upgraded is suspension and the upgrade came in the form of coilovers . <h> Why the coilovers are the way to go ? <p> First of all , we have to say that the impeccable blend of comfort and performance of the stock suspension on the Miata does the job perfectly well for everyday use . Upgrading them would make the car noticeably more capable on the track and many people opt to do so for the fun of it . However , if you decide to add more power " by adding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are no longer an additional perk , but rather a necessity . <p> There are more advanced ways of improving your suspension . The top notch ones would be air suspension , or some hydraulic systems . They are usually used on the most luxurious of cars and they offer the best adaptability . Luxury cars use them for comfort , but they can also be used to bag the cars " make them as low as possible . Whenever you see a bagged car , it most likely has air suspension . <p> The problem with air suspension is that it is incredibly expensive to buy and almost as expensive to maintain and service . Lastly , despite the diversity of options , the main purpose of air suspension is comfort , so most of them are not meant to be used as rugged , track-oriented systems . <p> If you want great versatility of settings and sporty ruggedness , go for coilovers . Even though they are noticeably cheaper than air suspension , they are also more expensive than regular sports shocks and springs . However , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worth it . <h> What are they ? <p> They are a mixture of a coil spring and a shock in one unit . There are several different kinds , including the ones that give you the option of adjusting the height of the car . The installation process for the Miata is a DIY job and a pretty straightforward one . Furthermore , most coilovers will fit the car , so you should n't have a problem with finding the set that is just perfect for your desires and budget . <p> A short video of Jason Fenske explaining how do coilovers work . ( these coilovers are for Integra , but the principle is the same ) : <h> Installation process <p> First of all , a little trick of the trade . If you are not an experienced mechanic and if you have n't observed the suspension on your Miata often , you should take pictures of the parts BEFORE you remove them from the car . There are loads of parts and if you are not familiar with them , you might have problems remembering where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , even though it is a simple task generally speaking . Make sure you know where everything should be and in which order . Explaining why losing any of the parts is not a good idea is probably not necessary . <h> Front coilovers installation <p> Step 1 Remove the front wheels to gain access to the brake line bracket bolt . That one is located on the strut body and even though you wo n't do anything with it immediately , doing this first will make things a lot easier later . <p> Step 2 This one is optional , but we would strongly recommend it . You should disconnect the sway bar from the link . Just remove the bolt and the nut and the sway bar should be released . This will give you more manoeuvring space and it will make things easier and safer and it is as easy as can be . It is optional , but there is literally no reason not to do it . <p> Step 3 Behind the disc brake you will find a nut and a bolt . These connect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Step 4 Remove the plastic trim that hides the engine . Do not pull it if you feel it 's stuck , since this probably means you have n't undone all of the bolts . Pulling it might break it and you do n't want that . Remove all of the bolts ( two per wheel well and a few more on the underside ) and the trim should come right off . <p> Step 5 Removing the trim will give you access to the bolt and nut that keep the upper control arm attached . This bolt is longer than the others . Undoing it will disconnect the upper control arm . <p> Step 6 Get yourself under the hood and undo the two nuts in the strut tower . Completely removing these enables you to remove the strut with ease , since these two nuts connect the top side of the strut to the strut tower . <p> Step 7 First of all , connect the strut to your spring compressor . After that , remove the nut that keeps the top mount connected to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ connected to the coilover after you remove it from the strut . While you are connecting the top mount and the coilover , make sure all of the parts are put in the right order . This is especially important for the parts that go between the spring and the top mount . Some types of coilovers might have more parts than others , but for each of them you should make sure that all of the parts are in the intended order . This should not be difficult , but it is paramount . <p> Step 9 Connect the mount and the coilover and make sure they are n't loose . <p> Step 10 Put the coilover in the wheel well and guide the studs of the top mount through the intended spaces in the strut tower . Tighten the two nuts at the top of the strut tower . These are the two nuts you removed from under the hood in the Step 6 . <p> Step 11 This is a combination of the first few steps in the reverse order . This is basically putting everything back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a ) Connect the upper control arm by using the long bolt . Make sure everything is in its original place , including the two washers . <p> b ) - Connect the lower control arm . <p> c ) Attach the sway bar to the link . <p> d ) Attach the bracket at the brake line <p> e ) Reinstall the plastic trim and do n't forget any of the bolts . Start from the underside . <p> f ) Put the wheel back <p> Repeat the steps for the other side of the front . <h> Rear coilovers installation <p> The process is pretty much the same , so I 'll just address the slight differences and give a quick rundown . <p> Step 1 After the rear wheels have been detached and removed , disconnect the sway bar . <p> Step 2 Undo the bolt that connects the control arm and the strut . <p> Step 3 Remove the carpet in the boot to access the top mounts for the rear wheels . <p> Step 4 Remove the metal cover that stands over the fuel line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and once you get to it , remove the two nuts . If you ca n't reach the nuts , do not use excessive force around the fuel lines . Rather use an extension . <p> Step 6 Upon removing the nuts , you will be able to pull the hub downwards and disconnect the shock . <p> Step 7 Remove the mount using the compressor and install it on the coilover just like you did for the front . <p> Step 8 Tighten the coilover top mount to the strut tower and reinstall the metal cover and then the carpet you removed earlier . <p> Step 9 Connect the lower part of the shock to the hub . <p> Step 10 Attach the sway bar and put the rear wheels back in their place . <p> That 's it . If you have any questions or suggestions , make sure you post them in the comment section and remember what you use your suspension for . You must be concentrated and very careful , since one loosely tightened bolt could cause serious issues .

@@83966127 @5466127/ <h> Which CarbonMiata Material ? <p> If you are wondering which material suits you the best , here is an explanation about the 3 materials that CarbonMiata- offers and their- manufacturing process . <p> MANUFACTURING PROCESS : <p> CarbonMiata uses vacuum bagging over conventional lay-up methods for their- carbon fiber and carbon kevlar parts because of its advantages . The first is that the finished product will yield a better strength rating and be lighter . Parts that are stronger yet lighter can have a serious competitive advantage over others , especially since they are more durable and use less resources and material . This is most evident when comparing the ratio of glass to resin which is better accomplished under the vacuum bag molding process . Another benefit is that the process is relatively easy to switch to and materials for basic parts are easily obtained . <p> FIBERGLASS : <p> Fiberglass is the heaviest of the 3 materials CarbonMiata proposes . Fiberglass is composed of melted glass that has been extruded though bushings ; this produces a string like material . This string is then woven into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , this cloth can be molded and bonded into any shape desired but fiberglass takes far less heat and pressure to accomplish this bond . Fiberglass is not as strong and light as carbon fiber but it is more flexible . <p> If you choose this material , the products will come in white gel coat and need to be painted just like this picture : <p> CARBON FIBER : <p> Carbon fiber is composed of carbon atoms bonded together to form a long chain . It is basically very thin strands of carbon ; even thinner than human hair . The strands can be twisted together , like yarn . The yarns can be woven together , like cloth . These cloths and yarns can be molded and bonded together into any shape desired . This bond is formed by using heat and pressure , combining the fiber with a plastic or a polymer . Carbon fiber is five times as strong as steel , two times as stiff , yet weighs about two-thirds less . Carbon fiber has slowly made its way into multiple industries , replacing metal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of CarbonMiata carbon fiber part : <p> CARBON KEVLAR : <p> The carbon kevlar is still a carbon fiber mesh in a matrix , but some kevlar fibers are added to increase strength . While being light and stiff , the carbon fiber is n't particularly strong . By adding some kevlar , you sacrifice some lightness ( ie , it'heavier ) but gains some strength . It has also this particular yellow weaving color .

This short run , as well as factory modifications including the turbo , wider tires , an upgraded suspension , and a six-speed manual has made the Mazdaspeed MX-5 well sought-after by some Miata enthusiasts . <p> The #Mazdaspeed Miata was a limited-run production of the second generation Miata , and is most notable for being the only production MX-5 to come with a turbocharger . The Mazdaspeed 's turbo and relatively small production run make some consider it to be a collectible , but does it really deserve that status ? <p> The Speed MX-5 was powered by the BP-4W engine from the normal Miata , now with an IHIRHF5 VJ35 turbocharger installed from the factory . It is still to this day the only Miata to be built with a turbocharger from the factory . <p> The turbo gave the car 178 horsepower , 36 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ performance . The Speed Miata could hit 60 mph in 6.7 seconds which was 1.4 seconds faster than the standard car . The car was upgraded in more than just the engine bay as well. - The Speed Miata featured Bilstein shocks , as well as shortened and stiffened springs and bigger anti-roll bars . The car was nicely optioned from the factory with a six-speed manual transmission as the only option . If you are going to buy one , you better not be picky about colors . In 2004 in the US market only two colors were on offer : Velocity Red Mica and Titanium Gray Metallic . <p> In 2005 , Lava Orange Mica and Black Mica also became available , pushing the paint options to a stunning four . The Mazdaspeed MX-5 was only built for two years and a mere 5,428 were produced . Only 1,428 were built in 2005 due to a fire at the factory . Nice examples of the Speed MX-5 can still be found for under $10,000 . This car was the only Miata to ever come with a turbo , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the manufacturing facility . This car easily has the makings of a future collectible and can be driven around as a weekend toy . You may be better off investing in stock , but stock wont make you grin like a Miata can !

@@83966198 @5466198/ <h> Tag : Sports car <p> The comparison between the Honda S2000 and the Mazda MX-5 is one frequently made by car enthusiasts . It is very easy for people to be dismissive on the basis of technical specifications and performance data . However , numbers cant quite do either car justice . Both of them possess unique qualities which are difficult to describe . A more relatable comparison to the two vehicles can be made metaphorically by referencing nature . The S2000 is a bird while the Miata is a butterfly . <p> The bird is constantly focused on the mechanics of flight while the butterfly is inherently more ethereal . The genteel flaps of the butterflys wings give it time to float and dance in the airwhile the bird wields the air to its will . Yet , as deliberate as the bird is , it manages to miss some of the nuance of flight . Direction changes are n't  as effortlessits accuracy omits some of the moments the butterfly ponders . In contrast , leaping and bounding over molecules of air renders the butterfly a student @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and trained professional . In making this comparison , its important to realize the humility of the butterfly . Quite simply , it was n't born to fly . In fact , its evolution to flight originates from its determination to live a mindful and observant existence without wings . It had to slowly traverse each pebble and leaf . The caterpillar squinted to see diffused sunlight through the same semi-translucent leaves that the bird stomped without regard . <p> These two machines were designed with similar capabilities , but completely different executions . The punchy and severe S2000 is powerful and precise , yet something is missed compared to the pensive MX-5 . An S2000 will soar and sear over the streets with authority . It will gracefully disperse plumes of smoke into the atmosphere while shredding a disciplined arc across any curve . Yet , it will never crawlit never had to . Since the S2000 was created and honed to be a fighter ; its goals managed to truncate its sensibilities . Its ambition to overcome competitors rendered it slightly too impatient to observe its surroundings . On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This is why the two vehicles can not be compared .
