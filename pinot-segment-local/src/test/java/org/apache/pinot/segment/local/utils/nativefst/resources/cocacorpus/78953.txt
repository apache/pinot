@@97010680 @1210680/ <p> Ever since Ford announced the new S550 Mustang platform , and pictures started to circulate , there has been a huge buzz across the tuner industry . That 's typically the effect when news of a new Mustang comes out . In Katy , TX , the guys over at Boost Works were chomping at the bit to get their 2015 GT , as they had big plans in store for the new pony . <p> Working with Kenne Bell and McLeod Clutch , they planned to be the first tuner shop in the country to successfully build and tune a supercharged 2015 GT . <p> " We were hell bent on being first , " Travis Burelle of Boost Works explained . " Every tuner shop out there wants to hit that first homerun ball . We looked at that and said , Hey , let 's go get a car and actually do it. Once we came up with a game plan , David and the crew over at Kenne Bell worked hand in hand with us to get parts overnighted . We spent hours going back and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ processes , and modifications necessary to make the S197 kit work on the S550 platform . " Kenne Bell is in the process of building a S550 specific kit , but in the meantime , Boost Works has developed an install kit that allows the S197 kit to bolt right up . <p> After several weeks of hard work , the car was strapped to the rollers . Tuning proved to be a challenge , but Jason Haynes ( of the Tuning School ) worked out the bugs . With its Kenne Bell 3.6LC Mammoth Supercharger Kit , the car responded with an impressive 653whp/507wtq dyno pull at 17 degrees of timing and very conservative 11:1 A/F ratio . - see all photos . <p> " We knew going in that tuning was going to be a challenge , " Travis explained .

Luckily , we employ one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Tuning School and started working with us this year . He s been a HUGE asset , and a big reason why we 've been so successful . He s not a big name in the Ford game , but you 're going to hear more about him very quickly . " <p> Armed with 2 laptops , boxes of pizza , and energy drinks , smoke soon poured out of Jasons ears while the data was crunched and the car was dialed in . " Back to back 655whp and 653whp pulls told us that we were done for now . At 11.93psi max boost , the power output is only limited by the stock throttle body . We were lacking a few things in the tuning tables to be able to get the big 168mm Kenne Bell oval TB dialed in , but thatll be coming soon . We expect power output to rise into the 700whp range on higher octane fuel . " <p> To support the added grunt , Boost Works teamed up with McLeod and Fidanza to get a RST Twin Disc system built and installed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for us in the past . McLeod makes a solid twin disc , and we wo n't run anything else if we can avoid it . The install is pretty straight forward , and the twin disc allows the car to retain stock-like drive-ability , " Travis explained . <p> The car also breathes through a 2.75 ? exhaust system , which Travis fabricated from mandrel bends . The cats have been removed , and a 2 bolt flange had been welded in place on the drivers side to mimic the passenger side manifold . " Ford decided to build the cat right into the manifold , making it all one piece . This was only done on the drivers side . The passenger side is identical to the S197 factory manifold . So , we simply cut the cat off , and TIG welded a 2 bolt flange to the collector on the drivers side , " Travis explained . " We built a 2.75 ? H-pipe , using stainless mandrel bends , and the resonator has been removed . The only factory pieces left are the 2.5 ? over-axle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the car include cracking the 9 second barrier , and a trip to the Texas Mile in March , where Boost Works is a sponsor . A sleeved/built long block is also in the works . " We want to go out and set the bar in terms of S550 performance/parts . Thanks to our crew here at Boost Works , we 've been able get a big jump on everyone . Curt Howell , and Jason Haynes have been a huge part of making this happen . We have a solid team , and look forward to what 2015 brings . Stay tuned ! "

There are two different gearing ratios available and hands down the best person to walk you through this is Ben Calimer at Calimer Transmission .

I was fortunate to have already swapped to a McLeod RXT and they re-hubbed my clutch disks to 26 spline for $75 . I 'm assuming most people doing this swap have switched from a factory clutch so this may take some research on your part . While we were in there we replaced the Slave Cylinder/Throw Out Bearing and the Pilot Bearing because , you 'd be crazy not to . I think the Slave is different , in that it 's slightly longer but I need to confirm this .

@@97010759 @1210759/ <p> Hey guys . I have the V1 front splitter from Aeroflow Dynamics headed my way for Christmas and I need your input . I am debating whether or not to order a set of support rods or just install without them . What are the advantages/disadvantages of having these ? are they a pain to install ? require drilling ? Basically are they even necessary or should I just throw the splitter on there without it . <p> Thanks for your input ! <p> Terminated <p> 12-16-2016 12:39 PM <p> Rods are n't truly necessary , but definitely have a purpose- especially if you race . They help support the splitter with the downforce it 'll have pushing down on it , and also help level it out . Without the rods it is possible for it to flex while driving or crack . Most people drill into the underside of the fascia 's midsection , but I ran mine into the lower grille . Plenty strong and cheaper to replace a $60 grille . <p> thanks for the pics , was bumper removal needed for securing it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not need bumper removed to install so I was trying to avoid that if I could lol. and it looks like you just drilled a hole through the splitter to attach the rods there ? <p> Terminated <p> 12-16-2016 01:23 PM <p> Yeah , I needed to remove the bumper to get to the other side of the grille . You can drill and put the rod through , but there is still nut that has to go on the back . Of course , I had to remove the fascia to install anyway , so I was already there . <p> chrisgonzales <p> 12-19-2016 12:49 AM <p> Like @Terminated said they are n't necessary but when you get up there in speed it can make a difference of pulling down or not depending on how well secured it is underneath .

@@97010764 @1210764/ <p> So after getting many calls about squeaky poly bushings on sway bars for the S550 Enthusiasts out there , I just thought I would post this up to inform and remind people of the importance of ensuring that you keep your poly bushings ( in pivot point locations ) properly lubricated . <p> We learned many many years ago that it was much better to integrate grease fittings into any poly bushed pivot points for a few reasons . <p> 1 : Noise . Polyurethane with an inner sleeve or bar that rotates must have a film/layer of quality lubrication to keep the noise away . Once heat , friction , force or the environment pushes or washes the lubrication out , you will typically experience a groaning noise . Once you hear this , it leads to #2 . <p> 2 : Damage . The lack of lubrication damages the poly bushing as well as the metal inside it ( sleeves or bars ) - due to excessive heat and surface deterioration . Running the poly improperly lubricated destroys the contact surface of the poly . Once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and that leads to the sleeve or bar inside the bushing getting damaged from getting to hot . You will commonly see this actually " melt " the coating on a sway bar . <p> Servicing - IT IS IMPORTANT ! With BMR , you simply connect your grease gun to our fittings and pump a high quality synthetic lube inside them and done ! Many companies out there , for whatever reason , make you remove your components to apply grease by hand . I fail to see the benefit to that . <p> Above is just an example . As you can see - the bushing was damaged . This may not be 100% due to the lack of lubrication , but in our testing we have discovered that the bushing will become damaged without proper lubrication . <p> That is damn sexy .... A week into ownership and as much as the car is amazing . The GT NEEDS BETTER swaybars . <p> This is definitely a selling point . <p> BMR Tech <p> 05-27-2016 01:50 PM <p> Next up - GREASE ! <p> Being in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imagine that we have tested just about every grease known to man . <p> What we have learned is - all greases are not equal . <p> Typically , for the average enthusiast , we recommend Super-Lube <p> LONG ... For the extreme-duty people out there , or for those who live in environments that see a lot of rain or snow , or excessive heat etc .... look no further than Amsoil . ( Synthetic Polymeric Truck , Chassis and Equipment Grease , NLGI #2 ) <p> This Grease is absolutely hands down the BEST . It resist wash out , push out , and break down from heat better than any lube I have ever used . <p> As for Delrin and lubrication - it really just depends . Technically , Delrin is somewhat " self-lubricating " due to it 's low drag coefficient . But , we have seen that to be hit or miss in terms of NVH without adding lubrication . <p> When Delrin material is used in a pivoting point , it is not a bad idea to use a quality lube . Needed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ zanGTA <p> 06-16-2016 11:37 AM <p> Well , I have here your vertical links with toe rods and Ford Performance Knuckle To Toe Link Bearing Assembly ready to be installed and would like to avoid any NVH or damage like that bushings.

@@97010793 @1210793/ <p> This is a guide on how to modify the As-Built data . The hardware you will need is an OBDLink MX either bluetooth or wifi . The top link is the Bluetooth version I purchased , the second link is the WiFi version . I can only speak for the Bluetooth version as verified working : <p> Next you will Need a program called : ForScan ( pronouced : Put your drink down , or swallow what 's in your mouth , " Forskin " ) The program can be downloaded from here : http : //forscan.org/home.html <p> Also this is the link to download " As-Built Data based on VIN# 's : https : **35;54;TOOLONG As long as you have a VIN# you can use this link to download the ab file for that year and model to use to compare lines . <p> The rest of this guide I can not take credit for , its from a user on another forum for a completely different ford car , but yet alot of the codes are similar across the fleet . This guide was made by " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and getting me started to look . <p> So read the Guide and let 's help one another out ! : ) All I want from posting this guide if Idont find it myself is how to stop the fog lights from turning off when you signal , that 's more then a thank you for me . <p> So I have been asked a lot how to do various tweaks or programming mods utilizing FORScan on a Windows PC or Tablet ( I personally use a Microsoft Surface 3 most of the time ) FORScan is compatible with a few Bluetooth or Wi-Fi OBD Adapters ... I personally recommend using an OBDLink MX Bluetooth ( Black Case ) or OBDLink MX Wi-Fi ( Red Case ) . I would only recommend the Wi-Fi version if you plan on using an iPhone with the FORScan app to monitor PID 's as iPhone restricts Bluetooth based devices . <p> As you can see you can modify As-Built Data on just about any module to accomplish different tasks . The FORScan team has added many of the same programmable parameters that are available in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some of those mentioned above . Others have been discovered by fellow forum members including ( Jesse ( OEMRadio ) , Jason ( JMR061 ) , and Myself ( DanMc85 ) ) and are done either manually via changing Hexadecimal digits or via As-Built File Import sent by them via e-mail . <p> These manual discoveries can be very time consuming ... Thus some changes could have a monetary charge by the person offering the mod or some ask for a donation in the amount of your choosing to continue to support the countless hours spent to discover these mods . <p> As a fellow forum member , I find it truly great when we work together to discover new computer mods or take risks to try and see what does what , knowing very well they could mess something up . Most of these changes are easily reversible . On modules like the BCM , most things should be tested while the car is in ON , but the engine is NOT running . Thus you can easily change something back if you make an invalid or incorrect change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incompatible settings , it is possible to screw something up . As long as a module does not loose network connection to the CAN bus you can always change the data back . I have made countless changes messing with modules and have yet to cause an issue I could n't put back . <p> As of this writing , all account requests are manually approved by the FORScan team . The team is located in Russia , so keep the time zone change in mind . As it can in some cases take easily 24 hours before your access gets approved . I have heard of some getting approved within 2 hours , especially during the evening here in the USA . <p> Once you have done this , install FORScan on your laptop or tablet . <p> Open the Program and click on the settings wheel on the toolbar on the left side . <p> You can leave the connection type on Auto , or you can choose Bluetooth or Wi-Fi depending on device type . Choosing a device type will allow the program to connect faster when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point pair your OBDLink or other Bluetooth OBD adapter to your PC using the normal windows settings for doing so . Then select the Bluetooth adapter in the drop down box in FORScan . If the drop down box remains blank or the OBD adapter is missing , close FORScan and open it again . It should be there after restarting the application . <p> The other settings should remain the same as the screenshot ... there are ways to modify cheap OBD adapters with a toggle switch and some soldering to read MS-CAN network . I will not discuss it , but instructions are on the web if desired . There is a drop down box to tell FORScan you added a toggle switch ( does not apply to OBDLink MX ) . <p> You now need to request a FORScan Extended License to Enable Programming Access . Currently FORScan will give a 2 Month License which you can request again after the 2 Months expires . The FORScan team does have plans to charge for the application in the future , which is why the licenses are for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the form and it will give you a file to save to your computer . Go back to the FORScan window and click on Load License Key . Navigate to the file you just saved and it will enable the license to access Programming Functions . You will now need to close the FORScan Application and open it again for the changes to take effect . <p> With your laptop or tablet in your car ... turn your vehicle ON but DO NOT START THE ENGINE ! Side Note : If you plan on messing with FORScan for a while , I recommend hooking a battery charger up to your vehicle 's battery . If you do hook up a charger , our cars have a battery monitoring system . Hook the positive connector to the battery and negative to the vehicle chassis , such as a bolt . Do NOT hook directly to both battery terminals ! If your battery dies or drops below 11 volts while writing programming ... that 's possibly game over ! ( May not be covered by warranty , if they discover how you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bottom of the FORScan window that looks like two plugs connected . Its the first button on the bottom left . <p> This will establish vehicle communications utilizing your computer and OBD module . If not already on it , if you click the Vehicle Icon on the Top Left with the I and then go to the Configuration tab . You will see your vehicle data populate along with all the discovered modules in your vehicle . It will also show their part numbers and current Strategy level . This is also known as the firmware version installed . At this time , FORScan can not update the module firmware , still only Ford IDS can do this.https : **30;91;TOOLONG <p> If you click the Modules tab at the top , you will see an easier to read list of the modules discovered and what CAN network each module is located on . <p> Once connected and you are done seeing what modules your vehicle has that you can access . Click on the Computer Chip icon on the middle of the left toolbar . You will now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if your Extended License is not loaded into the application . <p> You will see some that just say Module Configuration and some that say Module Configuration ( As-Built Format ) . The ones that say Module Configuration are pre-discovered values , mainly taken from Ford IDS to make changes in those modules . For Example , the BCM ( BdyCM ) will have the Enable Factory Remote Starter option and some others . The ones that say Module Configuration ( As Built Format ) will be the pure Hexadecimal values that can be changed . <p> Once you have decided what module you want to access click on it so it is highlighted . Then click the Play Button down at the bottom left of the FORScan application . <p> For my example I will use by BCM Module , which other than the Engine Computer is the main computer that controls everything inside the vehicle . <p> Once you hit the Play Button on the BdyCM ( As-Built Format ) option you will see a screen that looks like this : Note : It reads each memory block @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or so to load , before this screen pops up . <p> PLACE HOLDER <p> Each module has a memory address ... The BCM is at address 726 . Then there are memory blocks with multiple lines . <p> Here you can make any As-Built Hexadecimal changes as directed ... Once again I can not stress enough how important it is to be careful with what data you enter . Unless you know what you are doing with this sort of stuff , only change something that has been provided to you that is known to accomplish the desired change . <p> If you want to change something in a single line ... Make your change then hit Write at the end of the memory block . If you change data in multiple lines ... Make your changes , then hit Write All at the bottom of the FORScan window . ( Unless something requires changes in multiple spots , I recommend working one line at a time to see what effect the change has . Change of a single digit can completely change what does what , let alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a file by a recognized member on the forum , hit Load All at the bottom . Then select the file provided . Then hit Write All if not prompted to do so automatically . <p> The last two hexadecimal digits on each line are a mathematical checksum . If the line is modified to a non-official value , you will get an error upon clicking write . This is a safety check to make sure you actually want to do this change . If given a valid change for the entire line , this box wo n't pop up . Just changing one value will cause this box to appear . If you are sure you changed the correct digit , hit OK and FORScan will automatically recalculate the checksum to the new proper value . The last two digits wo n't help you find any new mod lol and they will change automatically when clicking write if you change them to an invalid value . <p> You can now hit Save All at the bottom , if you found something cool and want to back up your changes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the play button ends Module Programming for the selected module . This needs to be pressed before FORScan will let you use other items available on the left toolbar . <p> After making changes , you can possibly trigger some DTC codes ... or maybe you just want to use FORScan to see if you have any DTC 's . FORScan is a powerful tool , instead of reading the generic OBD DTC 's as most scan tools do . It has the power of Ford 's IDS tool , to pull codes from each individual module . Most of these codes can be identified within FORScan with a basic description . However , full details and steps to resolve/test can be found in the Official Ford Workshop Service Manual on motorcraftservice.com ( PAID ACCESS ) https : **30;123;TOOLONG <p> You can hit the First Triangle at the bottom with the paper icon to read DTC 's . You can hit the icon next to it with the Triangle and power icon to Reset and Clear DTC 's . You can also save the DTC list with the Floppy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ability to read or clear individual modules . Say you have a few DTC 's in different modules , but only want to clear let 's say a DTC in your C-CM , because your cruise control is n't playing nice . Click C-CM in the drop down box and now those read and clear buttons will only utilize that individual module instead of reading and clearing everything . <p> FORScan can also do the same module self-tests that Ford IDS can to check for problems or DTC 's in individual modules . It is great when trying to track down the source of a problem or something just is n't acting quite right . Also there is a button on the Left Toolbar to do Module Resets . Basically this is the computer equivalent of unplugging the power ( battery ) from a particular module and plugging it back in again . It forces a module to reboot or reset to its normal state if it is acting up . ( Note : this can cause DTC 's that may need to be cleared LONG ... <p> As you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hexadecimal value does what without a known source or trial and error . It takes countless hours to figure these computer mods out . <p> Good Luck and happy Hunting ! <p> Beef <p> 08-11-2016 03:34 AM <p> This is a niffty idea .... <p> fionic <p> 08-11-2016 08:05 AM <p> your attachment links are broken <p> also , THANK YOU <p> you mention hooking up a battery charger if you mess around for a while . how long is a while ? <p> when I have time I 'll definitely start trying to find additional changes . <p> fionic <p> 08-11-2016 08:45 AM <p> here are the byte values that AngelDeath has already discovered : <p> Quote : <p> Originally Posted by AngelDeath ( Post 1421676 ) <p> Codes found so far in BCM : <p> Simultaneous High Beams and Fog Lights location <p> Code : 726-27-01 : 0100 0001 0058 ( Disabled ) <p> Change to : 726-27-01 : 0100 0000 0057 ( Enabled ) <p> You can now use your fog lights with your high beams , especially if you are on a dark road with no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Engine on , Keyfob not in car ) : <p> Code : 726-41-02 0001 0001 0072 - Enabled <p> Change To : 726-41-02 0000 0001 0071 - Disabled <p> Now you do n't have that annoying Double Honk that you left the car on !

I posted the ones that AngelDeath has found so far . It 's possible they are very similar to older ford vehicles . <p> I think if we can get the VIN on a GT350 ( it has digital speedo , yes ? ) , we can get the AS-BUILT values , and compare to a standard GT and go from there . ( assuming it only needs a BCM change and not a software change ) . <p> edit . oops it looks like someone on the forum already figured this one out ? @AngelDeath , where did you see it ? edit2. the digital speedo comment was straight from the og post : LONG ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ / . still , could be similar values .

I would assume the Torsen LSD diff takes care of that wheel spin . <p> Oh and what exhaust is that ? <p> Wheel spin and wheel hop are somewhat related . Wheels hop occurs when the suspension flexes , under hard acceleration , causing the rear tires to " hop " while they are put under high stress . Ideally you do n't want either hop or spin . the sooner you gain traction the better . <p> Ill have an exhaust review video out shortly as well .

I assume launch control @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number on the track apps yet . Also , it actually does not turn off traction control . The traction control system basically steps in to help the car gain grip quicker , without bogging it down . I can say that I have tested and filmed traction control vs no traction control @ 3k RPM and if you can launch it right yourself then that 's the way to go . <p> You could see that cycle happen 7 times . This kills your ET versus slipping the clutch on your own and keeping the power up . <p> Agreed ! there is a big difference when you use a computer to launch a car vs the driver launching the car . After using it and testing it I found it good for beginners who don't/ca n't launch a car without some assistance , but the usefulness stops there .

Most " Full Synthetics " are far from it using lower cost base stock with better additive packages to get the lower cost base oil to perform closer to true synthetics . <p> This is a hot topic .

The Motorcraft synthetic blend is a good oil . Your motor was engineered and built to specifically use that oil and it performs well . <p> That being said , as long as you keep the viscosity the same and do n't just use dino oil , you 're going to be fine .

Yet for those times when a favorite road trip tune is called for , the all-new 2015 Mustang has that situation covered as well . <p> " As our team developed this Mustang , the goal was to improve the cars fidelity in every respect from the way it slices through a corner to the way the audio system reproduces the sound of favorite driving songs , " said Dave Pericak , Mustang chief engineer . " The process of rebuilding this car from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ driving experience . " <p> v&gt;Creating a solid foundation is essential to extracting the maximum performance out of the tires and suspension on the road . But that same foundation also provides numerous side benefits , such as enabling the audio system to provide cleaner , clearer sound . <p> The stronger body structure of the 2015 Mustang fastback is 28 percent more resistant to twisting than the previous model , resulting in less noise . The acoustic environment is also aided by improved aerodynamics that result from twice as much simulation and wind tunnel development significantly reducing wind noise , especially at highway speeds . <p> " With a fundamentally quieter baseline to work from , we had a better acoustic environment to tune the audio systems in the new car , " said Joe Kafati , multimedia systems supervisor . " The reduction in ambient noise enabled us to achieve the same sound pressure levels in the cabin with much less power and distortion . " <p> The new Mustang is again available with three audio systems , each of which is better than the system it replaces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ six-speaker configuration with separate high-frequency tweeters , now mounted in the A-pillars and pointing across the cabin to provide more direct sound to the driver and front passenger . <p> The more rigid doors of the new Mustang enable the use of slimmer , lighter 6.5-inch door speakers that do n't  need as much travel to produce comparable audio volume , with higher-fidelity mid-range and bass sound . A pair of 6.5-inch round full-range speakers are mounted in the rear package tray of the fastback , or in the quarter panels in the convertible . <p> Both available premium audio systems add a front center speaker mounted in the top of the instrument panel for improved vocal and speech clarity . These systems add a separate 8+1-channel amplifier , and use powerful neodymium magnet speakers to help reduce weight while improving overall sensitivity and sound reproduction . The mid-range nine-speaker system adds a second speaker to each door , separating the low and mid-range frequencies for improved fidelity . <p> Stepping up to the top-end Shaker Pro system that is available on Mustang EcoBoost Premium and Mustang GT Premium brings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tweeter/woofers in the rear , plus a trunk-mounted subwoofer for maximum bass response . The subwoofer has been repackaged to fit into the rear corner of the trunk , leaving more space for cargo . Even with the Shaker Pro audio system , the 2015 Mustang convertible can still accommodate two large golf bags , or everything you would need for a weekend getaway . <p> " We took advantage of our new acoustics lab to tune the equalization modes for each system to provide improved clarity across all frequency ranges and in different driving conditions , " said Kafati . " The lab provides us with a consistent baseline for measuring the response of audio systems with a wide variety of music and spoken word content . " <p> Using the lab , Kafati and his colleagues can take objective measurements and bring in listeners to evaluate the audio from each seating position , ensuring everything sounds clear and well balanced . <p> With mobile technology constantly evolving , Ford SYNC has always been designed to enable drivers to easily connect devices of their choice . Mustang is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ port in the media bin at the base of the center stack to charge those devices twice as fast as before . <p> No matter which audio system a Mustang customer selects , supplemental controls on the steering wheel and voice activation for hands-free operation are standard . With standard Bluetooth wireless connectivity , drivers do n't  even have to take their phone out of pocket or purse to stream music or take calls . <p> Each of the three available systems includes a single-disc CD player and auxiliary input . The standard audio system also features next-generation SYNC AppLink , enabling drivers to take advantage of selected smartphone apps while keeping hands on the wheel and eyes on the road . <p> " Whether its a V8 rumble or Mustang Sally , we 've worked to make this the best-sounding Mustang ever , " said Kafati . <p> Thanks for posting that !

@@97010861 @1210861/ <p> Just wanted to share a new system we have developed after working with so many Supercharged 2015 + Mustang Coyote Owners . This system was designed to fix the major problem all the supercharger manufacturers created by blocking the PCV vacuum from the crankcase and running both the in and out of the PCV system together . <p> I have seen this on the Procharger setup the other day when the guys from MAK Performance came up . They also say this is a problem on many of the supercharger kits for the 2015 + Mustangs . By running the PCV system this way it shows us just how little everyone knows about the function of the PCV system and how important it is to maintain the True qualities High Performance street car . <p> To make it simple , it 's for the same reason racers use evacuation pumps on their engines to improve ring seal and overall power and performance . Exactly what the PCV system function accomplishes . As PCV systems work more efficiently we have seen an increase in how many engines and platforms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the engine . <p> This has created the need for a catch can / oil separator to control the oil from being scavenged through the PCV system into your engine and eventually degrading octane levels and introducing carbon deposits as well as causing detonation and even leading to piston and ring failure . <p> Now the biggest problem with running breathers or blocking off the vacuum from the PCV system and only using the connections at the valve covers to pull vacuum for the weakest source in an effort to control oil is a even worse misconception . Not only do you lose all the vacuum that gave you much better MPG , Idle Quality and Drive-ability you are now introducing oil directly through the supercharger and or inter-cooler and all the intake tubing to allow them to become saturated with oil . <p> We developed a solution that allows you PCV system to be run properly and eliminates boost from pressurizing the crankcase without blocking off the very lines that allow the system to perform so well . The first thing is to run your main Dirty Side PCV @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Can System and then to run the vacuum from the manifold to the Clean Side PCV line to the outlet of the UPR Dual Valve Catch Can System . <p> Now that you are controlling the oil we need to take care of pressurizing the crankcase and still maintaining vacuum under wide open throttle . This is where we have incorporated a UPR Billet One Way Valve into the Clean Side PCV line to allow the system to close the line during boost and protect the crankcase from becoming flooded with boost and also not allowing boost / Hp to escape . <p> The most important part of the Dual Valve System is to have a secondary vacuum source that only sees vacuum to be able to evacuate the crankcase and keep the correct direction and flow of the PCV system functioning properly . This connection gets routed to the inlet of the supercharger to give your engine the proper vacuum to allow your vehicle to make even better power during wide open throttle . <p> By giving the engine a vacuum source similar to a vacuum pump , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pressurizing the crankcase and having the piston to fight it during each stroke . This is the main reason people have resorted to breathers because no one has developed a real solution for this situation . <p> We have been testing this theory and found the physics and results to be solid through the vehicles and builders we are testing this with . We are just finishing the systems for the 2015 Mustang Coyote 's and have taken our time to carefully go through each step and back-up what we confirmed .... <p> I just wanted to share the new found solution to properly handling engine oil blow-by . The most common results from this have been Improved MPG , Crisper Throttle and a Stronger Idle . MOST Importantly the is the Supercharger and Intake Tubing / Inter-coolers remaining much cleaner and even oil free . <p> MAK Performance - Stage 3 Motorsports - CJ PonyParts <p> Have been a few of the companies that we work with who have been able to see how well the UPR Dual Valve Catch Can Systems perform through their customers and personal vehicles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ break through with everyone and it 's not meant to be spam or a solicitation . <p> Thank you , Joe <p> UPRSteve <p> 01-29-2015 11:00 AM <p> here is a link to the thread that MAK Performance made showing the installation of it on a Procharged 2015

@@97010916 @1210916/ <p> We 've discussed our catch can system , and posted several teaser images in a variety of threads here on the forum . We are now getting a bit closer to the completion of this project . We thought it would be a great idea to show you guys the development process that we take to design our direct fit catch can setups . Follow the progress on our blog , or posted in this thread below . Additionally , our testing will confirm/deny any claims regarding the need or effectiveness of installing a catch can on your Mustang . <p> Does it need a catch can ? This question is on the minds of many vehicle enthusiasts . If it does n't  add power , why would I want it ? Why should I waste my money on it ? All valid questions here . True , a catch can install will not add power to your vehicle , but that does not negate its function as a beneficial component for your vehicle . <p> Let 's jump into the basic benefits of a catch can . Its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by-products from your vehicles crankcase ventilation ( CCV ) system before they reenter the intake tract . If these by-products are not captured , they move into the intake system , which can cause several problems . But first , let 's learn a bit about CCV systems and how they function to improve emissions and protect our environment . Without going into too much detail , your engine features a CCV ( crankcase ventilation ) system that works to improve engine efficiency and emissions . During engine operation the crankcase generates pressure as combustion gases pass the piston rings . This pressure is evacuated from the crankcase and is routed into the intake system . The byproducts within the ventilated air will then be burned in the combustion process.When oil enters the intake , it coats the tract , throttle body , and valves . It is then burned in the combustion chamber , which lowers the octane rating of the mixture . Although not optimal for performance , this process does create a clean engine that requires no emptying of by-products and contaminants . Most manufacturers utilize this process @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , collected , and disposed of properly . <p> Every engine is susceptible to blow-by from the piston rings . It is impossible to have a completely leak-free seal between the rings and cylinder wall . If pressure builds up in the crankcase , it will eventually find a weak point , normally a gasket or seal , and will result in fluid leaks . <p> Ford Mustang 2.3L EcoBoost CCV System Two primary lines make up the CCV system equipped on most modern engines . The first , the makeup air line , routes from the valve cover to the intake piping . This line provides a light vacuum on the crankcase and is mostly used during wide-open throttle situations . This line can be found on the passenger side of the 2.3L Ecoboost and routes to the intake just before the turbocharger compressor housing . Check out a shot of the port on the valve cover and the stock line . <p> You will notice a few unique features on this hose . One , this hose features some slick quick-disconnect fittings that seal to the connection points @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in-line sensor . Take a closer look at this sensor , which reads pressure/flow . <p> This sensor would help identify any leaks or blockages in the system , which could cause internal engine concerns or just emissions problems . We would need to retain this particular component when we develop our kit . <p> The second , the ventilation line , routes from the PCV valve to the throttle body . A small plate attaches to the side of the engine block on the driver side of the vehicle , which encompasses the PCV valve . This line features a higher vacuum source than the makeup air line . The ventilation line is used during idle and part-throttle driving situations . The valve works to eliminate the pressure from the intake manifold so it can not enter the crankcase . Here is a shot of the connection point , just after the throttle body . <p> The other end of this hose is connected to a plate that encompasses the PCV valve . This is very similar to the 2.0L EcoBoost engine found in the Focus , as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Take a look at this unique PCV valve system . <p> These two hoses/lines will function together to provide optimal crankcase pressures for efficient operation . Engines typically function more efficiently with a slight pull on the crankcase . <p> Now that we know how the system functions , we can determine what will happen if this system is left as stock , without the use of a catch can . <p> Pitfalls of Not Utilizing a Catch Can <p> Oil will coat the internal portion of your intake and intercooler system . <p> The internal combustion engines is not typically the cleanest area of a vehicle . Fluids , gases , byproducts , and general noise are to be expected ( this is why we love them ! ) . That being said , you do not want the internal air tract of your brand new vehicle to be coated in oil ? This oil can cause sticking/failing components ( throttle body ) , and can even reduce the efficiency of your intercooler . As oil builds up on the internal portion of this heat exchanger , it will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ popping off your intercooler , only to be treated to a solid half quart of oil spilling all over yourself ( VW TDI problems ! ) . In general , the earlier you add a catch can to the system , the less chance you have of buildup over time . Keep your intake system clean and you should have fewer issues in the long run . <p> Oil/carbon will build up on your intake valves , eventually resulting in reduced flow or blockages . <p> This occurs commonly in a variety of vehicles featuring direct-injection systems . Fuel is a fantastic solvent and can work to degrease certain components . In a traditional port-injection system , fuel is sprayed into the intake manifold before the valves , which allows the fuel to clean the valves on its way into the combustion chamber . In a direct-injection engine , this fuel is sprayed directly into the chamber and never makes contact with the portion of the valve in the manifold . Several other manufacturers/vehicles with direct injection ( e.g. , BMW E90 , VW 2.0T ) have had serious problems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miles . This is a dubious tradeoff for the improved fuel economy and power . A catch can will reduce this buildup and increase the time interval between valve cleanings . If a valve begins to incur deposits , airflow into the combustion chamber can be reduced or even blocked , which would negatively affect performance . This is another reason you want to keep the intake tract of your vehicle clean . <p> Oil is burned in the combustion chamber , reducing the octane rating of the mixture and increasing the chance of predetonation . <p> If you are unable to capture the oil deposits before they enter the combustion chamber , the negative impact will continue . Oil will reduce the octane rating of the fuel mixture , which would then increase the chance of detonation . Not good , especially for vehicles with aggressive tunes . Once again , this will have a serious negative impact on your vehicles performance . <p> I hope none of this scared you away from driving your car ! These issues are generally accepted by vehicle manufacturers ; however , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fall to pieces if you continue to drive it as-is for 100,000 miles . However , if you want to effectively reduce the negative impacts of the CCV system on your new Mustang , a catch can is a great upgrade for you . We could call this an upgrade in preventive maintenance . With our new knowledge of the Mustang system , it was time to set our team to work selecting a catch can and making brackets and lines . <p> Check back with us next time for a look at our projected catch can setup , including some fabrication work to design the brackets . <p> Thanks for reading ! <p> wireless <p> 12-17-2014 12:39 PM <p> Pricing on a pre-order ?

We are currently testing a dual can setup , one for the PCV line and the other for the breather line . We are still road testing this prototype to determine how much fluid each can is collecting . Once complete , we can decide if this kit needs to be a single or dual can system . This will impact pricing , but either way the kit will be an awesome value .

In 2013 , Ford Motor Company shipped more than 380,000 vehicles from the United States , making the automaker a top U.S. exporter of vehicles . <p> " Henry Ford exported the sixth Model A assembled in 1903 and we continue this legacy today , " said Joe Hinrichs , Ford president of The Americas .

The all-new 2015 Mustang is supported by U.S. suppliers in 25 states . In 2013 , Flat Rock Assembly Plant in Michigan , the cars production home , celebrated the 1 millionth Mustang built there . The facility has approximately 3,000 employees working two shifts at full capacity to produce Mustang and Fusion . In addition , 100 jobs at the Port of Portland have now been added to support Ford exports bound for Asia Pacific and other markets . <p> " Serving as a gateway for exports of new Ford vehicles to China and Korea has helped boost employment and bolster our local economy , " said Bill Wyatt , executive director for the Port of Portland . " Auto exports and imports support more than 500 jobs at our marine terminals , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ portfolio since 1953 . " <p> Preparing Mustang for export <p> Mustangs exported from the United States undergo a series of steps to ensure compliance with vehicle standards in the destination countries . At each ports homologation center , Ford and Lincoln vehicles receive finishing touches that follow specific engineering work completed in production at the plant . Vehicles undergo proper customs documentation and tracking so Ford can ensure their progress and delivery . Certain vehicles receive an underbody coating and documents in the destination country language . <p> " Preparing these vehicles for shipment to their final destination is critical to satisfying both customer and regulatory requirements for our markets around the world , " said Gerald Schoenle , director , Ford Trading Company . " We want our customers globally to know that their Ford vehicles will meet emissions , safety and road-worthiness requirements .

In September 2014 , Ford Motor Company began shipping Lincoln vehicles from the Port of Portland to China , marking a significant milestone for the brand globally . The shipment , which included Lincoln MKC vehicles made in Kentucky , is part of Fords commitment to offer a unique experience designed to revolutionize the way premium cars are sold in China . By the end of 2014 , there were a total of eight Lincoln dealers throughout China . <p> I wonder what the sales numbers will be in various parts of the world .
