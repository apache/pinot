However , many people get overly creative with their claims , creating lawsuits over laughable causes . Most of these cases get thrown out . But if a business is truly concerned about the fees associated with a frivolous lawsuit , business liability insurance can be helpful . Below are among the most bizarre and absurd lawsuits placed against major corporations . <p> Perhaps the most famous " frivolous " lawsuit , Liebeck v. McDonald 's is a case in which 80-year-old Stella Liebeck spilled a McDonald 's coffee in her lap , causing third-degree burns on her legs , lap , and groin area . After she filed the lawsuit , many people criticized her without hearing the full story . After all , coffee is supposed to be hot . In reality , McDonalds has had over 700 complaints filed concerning the scalding temperatures of its coffee , which is served between 180 and 190 degrees for " optimum flavor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most restaurants is served at around 140 degrees . Liebeck tried to solicit McDonald 's for a mere $800 to cover the skin grafts required for her injuries , but McDonald 's refused . Ultimately , the jury settled , awarding Liebeck $2.7 million . <p> Richard Overton sued Anheuser-Busch for false advertising when drinking a six-pack of Bud Light failed to produce visions of beautiful women on a balmy beach . He sought damages for $10,000 , claiming that this deceptive marketing caused him emotional and psychological distress . In other words , Overton was mad that drinking beer did n't equal hot beach babes . The case was dropped , of course . Hopefully Overton learned a lesson or two about the difference between fantasy and reality . In reality , drinking excessive amounts of Bud Light will only give you a sizable beer gut and a noticeable repellent towards bikini-clad women . <p> The parents of Karen Norman sued Honda when their daughter died from not being able to escape from her Civic after backing into Galveston Bay . At first , the case sounds somewhat legitimate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For example , the Normans sued Honda because their daughter was unable to hit the emergency release button on the seatbelt . However , she failed to hit the button most likely because she had a blood-alcohol level of 0.17 and should n't have been driving in the first place . The incident happened at 2 a.m. with passenger Josel Woods in the passenger seat . Woods was able to swim to safety . Here 's the kicker : the jury actually awarded the parents with just 25% of the damages considered contributorily negligent . Thus , the Normans basically sued and won against Honda in spite of their daughter 's obvious irresponsibility for driving under the influence . <p> Austin Aitken sued NBC for $2.5 million after a particularly grotesque challenge on Fear Factor allegedly made him vomit and run into a wall . According to Aitken , he was a regular watcher of the show and nothing had previously caused such a reaction until he witnessed contestants competing in a rat-eating challenge . In the show , the rats had been processed in a blender and then served @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pressure to rise so much he became disoriented and was unable to see the door on his way to the other room . Aitken claimed that the $2.5 million was an arbitrary amount and that he simply wanted to send networks a message that shows have become too graphic . The judge ultimately threw the suit out , which makes sense . If you do n't want to watch something specific on TV , changing the channel is an effective means of escape . <p> Fifty-seven-year-old Cleanthi Peters filed a suit against Universal Studios for $15,000 because she claimed the annual Halloween Horror Nights haunted house was too scary . After visiting with her 10-year-old granddaughter in 1998 , she claimed the haunted house caused her emotional distress . While exiting the haunted house , she was supposedly chased down by a chainsaw-wielding Leatherface ( from the movie Texas Chainsaw Massacre ) , causing her to trip and fall . She claims that the haunted house actor then brandished the weapon over her in a traumatic way . So traumatic , in fact , that it can only be relieved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ haunted houses are supposed to be frightening in nature ? If you ca n't handle the flames , stay out of the fire . <p> A man by the name of Dalton Chiscolm is suing Bank of America for " 1,784 BILLION , TRILLION Dollars " , which , coincidentally , is a larger amount than the planet 's gross domestic product . Apparently , his reason for suing the corporation arose from several frustrating phone calls he made to settle some incorrectly deposited checks . The case was thrown out , mainly because there was no federal cause of action for the lawsuit . Along with the absurd amount , Chiscolm asked that the money be deposited into his account the following day with an additional $200,164,000 for his troubles . <p> Lauren Rosenberg decided to sue Google for an excess of $100,000 in 2009 when Google Maps advised her to walk on the freeway to get to her destination , causing her to get hit by a car . She also sued the driver of the car . Apparently , the directions took Rosenberg onto Utah State Route @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she meandered along the edge of the road , trusting an electronic device over her apparently missing common sense . Google maps does its best to give users an estimation on directions , but sometimes it gets them wrong , as most computerized programs are bound to do from time to time . Without accurate information of routes in a specific area , Google can only do so much to ensure you get to your destination without being pummeled down by a car . Rosenberg claims that Google should have used its Street View feature to deduce the lack of safety in walking in the area . Perhaps she should have used her own eyeballs , too . <p> David Roller filed a $2 million lawsuit against magician David Blaine and another $50 million lawsuit against David Copperfield because he claims the two men " stole his Godly powers . " According to Roller , the magicians used witchcraft to extort his powers . The underlying message here is that Roller , in his " godliness , " has any powers to begin with . As if we need any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his personal website uncovers messages from him in which he stated his belief that Bill Gates would be running against him in the 2008 presidential election . <p> Dan Shannon and Jay Kelly , two PETA members , were leaving an anti-hunting campaign when their Honda Civic was struck by a deer bounding across the road . As a result of the ensuing damage done to the vehicle , they decided to sue the Division of Fish and Wildlife in the New Jersey area . How does this make sense ? According to PETA , the deer incident occurred because of the recent deer management program , which stipulated that the Division of Fish and Wildlife increase the deer population so that there will be more available for hunting season . PETA goes on to claim that deer are running across freeways willy-nilly to escape the bloodshed all around them . As usual , PETA is being overly dramatic about animals which , in excess , can cause a real problem . As expected , they are simply trying to find a way to make their own deer-murdering someone else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the Exxon tiger looked too similar to Kellogg 's Frosted Flakes spokesperson Tony the Tiger . Even though both tigers have been emblematic of their respective brands for more than 30 years , Kellogg for some reason felt threatened by the Exxon tiger , concerned that children would mistake the gas station cat for the beloved beast on their cereal box . The matter of trademarking is understandable . However , the fact that Kellogg waited so long to pursue the lawsuit sort of strips them of all credibility .

The web has to be one of the best inventions we have ever seen , it makes so many things much easier and things just keep getting better . Because of all the new amazing technology some old business models have been dramatically changed forever , most of these businesses are still going and continue to thrive , but some are just barely hanging on . Here are 5 of the biggest business models that have been affected by modern day technology , and the ones who have embraced it are the ones that are still doing will and will continue to survive . <p> Travel Travel has always been and always will be a huge industry even though it has seen a lot of changes due to the internet . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or an extended business trip was through a travel agent , unless you chose to do it on your own which required a decent amount of time on the phone and other time to plan everything so it all worked out without a hitch . This has all changed now with so many different websites out there that can help you easily book a trip within a matter of minutes , and that includes booking EVERYTHING too flight , hotel , car rentals and much more can all be done with a few clicks and a credit card . There has been a decrease in travel agencies , but there are still some out there and there are people that do still use them but it is not a popular career choice for the younger generations now because it can be a struggle since so many people choose to use the web to do it all themselves with little or no fees . Traveling has been made easier due to technology in more ways than that though , with technology like smart phones and tablets it is easy to check @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can make sure your flight is on time and you know about any delays right away so you can plan accordingly . <p> Video Rentals Technology has changed the video rental business very dramatically , and many video stores are out of business , going out of business , or struggling to stay afloat . Streaming video has become extremely popular and many people are choosing to pay so they can stream new movies right from their homes , computers , tablets , and even smart phones . The DVD business is still going strong , but it is not video rental stores that are thriving , it is companies like Netflix that ship right to your door . Blockbuster has closed many of their physical locations but they are still going strong because they adopted a similar business model to Netflix and they ship right to you . Pirating of movies on the internet has also hurt video rentals and movie theaters since many movies hit the web shortly after they arrive in theaters and millions of people are illegally downloading them to watch for free at home . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have seen many changes in the music industry , first it was CDs wiping out cassettes and over the last 10 years we have seen CDs starting to die out because of MP3 players and digital music downloads . The music industry has been good about embracing the legal side of digital music and you can easily find anything you want in MP3 format so you can purchase right online and download full albums right to your computer and onto your MP3 player . Much like video stores we have been seeing record stores closing down their physical locations and many have gone out of business altogether , trying to find a record store nowadays is becoming increasingly more difficult and soon there will be none left except smaller niche stores that cater to people that still enjoy vinyl and other older formats . One of the bigger problems the music industry faces are the pirated copies of albums that millions of people take advantage of . 90% of the time full albums are available on piracy websites months before the albums are actually released , and torrent sites are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is illegal and they are trying to crack down on it but it happens so often and so many do it that it is extremely hard for them to wipe out completely . There are bands and labels that do embrace that though , and they focus on making money by touring and selling their merchandise while on tour . The band Radiohead is a perfect example , they have given their last couple of albums away for free but many people chose to donate money to them so they still made millions off of the albums . <p> Newspapers The newspaper industry is one of the businesses that is hurting most from new technology since many people get all of their news right on the internet for free . Many of the larger newspaper companies have gone online and are still able to stay in business because they are able to get the news out for free but monetize their websites with advertisements . Quite a few of these companies have stopped printing papers altogether and have opted to just go online with them , most are free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read full news stories , whether or not that is a good idea for them is debatable though since there are so many free news sources . One of the negative side effects of the dying newspaper industry is the fact that many people who had a career in printing are trying to find new work in the printing industry , but the old fashioned way of printing has also changed because of easier and faster digital printing equipment . <p> Book Stores Book stores are one of the business models seeing the most problems because of technology , especially over the last 5 years . E-readers are starting to replace old fashioned books , and it is not just the e-readers themselves , but also the app formats of them which allow people to buy and read books right from their smart phones and tablets . Recently we have been seeing bookstore going out of business around the world , the most recent that everyone heard about was the closing of Borders . There are some still doing alright because they have embraced technology and came out with their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still profit from modern technology . Many of the book stores that are still in business are struggling , and sadly many will not be able to last much longer as more and more people start buying Kindles and other readers .

It 'd be like Coca-Cola going under even though a large chunk of the population refer to all sodas as " Coke . " But even the most recognizable businesses sometimes ca n't adjust to changes in the market or overcome financial troubles . These companies were once the top in their field , but fell to the point where filing bankruptcy was their best option . <p> We 're barely into 2012 and a major company has already filed for bankruptcy . Eastman Kodak , the groundbreaking photography company that 's been around since the late 1800s , saw its stock drop 35% after they filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in January . The age of digital photography seems to have caused some innovation problems for the business that made a name for itself by selling cheap cameras and making most of their profit through film and supplies to print photos . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kodak found itself with $6.75 billion in debt . Not exactly a Kodak moment for the company . <p> Even if you were too young to understand it all when the trouble went down , you 've probably at least heard of Enron , which became synonymous with corporate greed and corruption . In 2000 , the company was considered a leading business in electricity and natural gas , along with several other services . By the end of 2001 , Enron had filed for bankruptcy after it came out that they 'd been cooking the books regularly . The scandal affected corporations all over the U.S. by calling into question corporate accounting practices in general , which led to a federal investor protection act , and affected employees and investors with the company who lost jobs or huge amounts of money ( or both ) . <p> We still remember Blockbuster , right ? We used to go there before hosting a slumber party or having a date night at home to pick up the newest releases to snuggle up to . There 's no doubt that it stole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and any mom-and-pop rental stores in town . Once RedBox and Netflix came around , though , it was harder for Blockbuster to hold onto their dominance in the home entertainment industry , and in 2010 , the company was forced to file for bankruptcy . Dish Network won the enterprise at auction in 2011 . <p> Schwinn has been the quintessential bike for kids and adults alike since the company gained overwhelming popularity in the ' 60s . So you 'd probably be surprised to hear that the company of the perfect cruising bike has declared bankruptcy twice . By 1990 , many other bicycle brands were gaining traction in the market and Schwinn began exporting production to save money . By 1993 , they had declared bankruptcy . The company was bought by an investment group . In 2001 , it filed for bankruptcy again , and was purchased by Pacific Cycle at auction . <p> General Motors was consistently considered the leading automaker in the world for 77 years , up until 2007 .

Some contestants on Wheel of Fortune probably wish they could bounce back from a " Bankrupt " like that . <p> We do n't want to get into a debate over the superiority of Marvel over DC ( or vice versa ) , but there 's no denying that Marvel has been one of the top comic book companies for the past couple of decades . The parent company of Marvel Comics , and thus some of your favorite character like Spider-Man , the X-Men , and Captain America , has needed its own hero in its business history . Facing money problems and unable to come to a bailout deal with bondholders , Marvel filed for bankruptcy in 1996 . The resulting drama with shareholders could 've filled a ( very boring ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Marvel Entertainment and ToyBiz to create Marvel Enterprises . <p> Men 's fashion leader Hugo Boss ' story is kind of backwards compared to the rest of these . While the master tailor was creating great clothes before his bankruptcy , his company is now a giant in the good-looking men industry . Hugo Boss himself started the company in 1924 in a small town in Germany , but because the economy was so tough after World War I , he had to declare bankruptcy after just six years . But in 1931 , he picked back up and began building an empire . Today , the company does business in 110 countries with several fashion lines for both men and women . <p> Remember that dark time in recent history when people were going around eating nothing but big slabs of meat ?

Creative thinking can include a sudden epiphany , an answer after an extended period of work , or an idea borne out of improvisation .

Being dependable in business includes showing up to work on time , following through with assigned tasks , and not abusing sick or vacation days . Being flexible with regard to your role at work and intuiting what your boss may or may not require of you day to day are also indications of your dependability . Dependability points to your personal integrity , which translates to respect , not only for your boss and co-workers , but for yourself as well . <p> The etymology of the word " compassion " goes back to the Latin words " com " meaning " with " and " pati " meaning " to suffer . " Compassion expressed by a manager or co-worker creates a dynamic in the workplace where people feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ produce in terms of quotas or profits . Lack of compassion creates a tense environment , where team members feel alienated from one another instead of connected .

" <p> The enthusiasm you bring to your work is contagious and stimulates opportunities for growth and positive change . Great leaders , such as conductor and teacher Benjamin Zander , understand this . " Teaching is about opening new possibilities , " says Zander . " Opening up new ways of thinking . " The level of enthusiasm Zander brings to teaching and conducting neutralizes insecurity and fear , traits that create inertia in individuals as well as business . <p> Self-motivation is key to being effective in any environment , be it business , creative , or spiritual .

Being curious is a way of acknowledging that you do n't know everything and recognize that models and innovations outside of your " sphere of influence " might provide you with knowledge you can apply to your field . To that point , curiosity can inspire creativity and , maybe most importantly , compassion , two traits we 've already listed .

" The next time you experience failure , just pick yourself up , dust yourself off , and start all over again . <p> Confidence in your interactions with co-workers , clients , and managers will help prevent unfair and inaccurate judgments regarding your skills and personality . But being confident does n't mean being brusque , obnoxious , or bullying .

Expressing confidence is not only helpful to you but to those you work with , who may be seeking inspiration and guidance .

But as their stress winds down , other Americans are in full-out hunting mode . They 're alert , focused , and ready to pounce on every Black Friday deal they set their sights on ( and anyone who gets in their way ) . For every one of these manic shoppers , though , there are dozens of people who hate the materialistic practice , especially since it takes place a day after we are supposed to take stock of our many blessings . The country would probably be a lot better off without the Black Friday tradition , for these 10 reasons and many more . <p> A few years ago , a Wal-Mart worker was killed in a stampede on the treacherous day after Thanksgiving . As the management prepared to open the store doors at 5 a.m. , the employee was pushed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surged through the entrance to get to the deals . Dozens of people are injured each year by the crazed crowds who are too eager to get popular items . Common injuries include bruises , sprained ankles , broken bones , and sometimes even concussions . The government has passed regulations for improved Black Friday safety , such as starting the line farther from the door and removing items that can be used as battering rams , but the unruly crowds and often-freezing temperatures seem like enough reason to call off the holiday altogether . <p> You ca n't even mention Rebecca Black and Friday in the same sentence without getting the maddening song " Friday " stuck in your head . Maybe Kohl 's is hoping that the song will also get the idea of shopping Kohl 's sales engrained in shoppers ' brains by using the viral tune in their Black Friday ads . We could 've gone the rest of our lives without hearing that song again , but Kohl 's just had to bring it back . Most people , even those who love Black Friday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time-honored shopping holiday would be a small sacrifice if it helped us forget Rebecca Black 's soul-crushing music . <p> Frustrating traffic and rude drivers have made us all too familiar with road rage , but the same kind of scenarios without the cars also make us susceptible to shopping rage . Crowded stores and long lines can turn the calmest people into terrifying lunatics . Throw in the scramble for a good deal , and any store can turn into a mob scene or break out into fights . This kind of rage can happen at any point during the year , but it increases around the holidays when shoppers are particularly stressed and stores are especially crowded . People have even died as a result of shopping rage , like the Houston man who was killed in an argument at a Wal-Mart in 2002 . <p> Getting rid of Black Friday would n't necessarily mean shoppers would miss out on holiday-time deals . Cyber Monday , the Monday following Thanksgiving , has become the preferred deal day for many people and is a far more civil practice . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people out of the way for the last TV , and no scary mob mentality . You can shop for discounted goods from the comfort of your own home , and though some of the deals from Black Friday might be sold out , many sites offer better or different specials on Cyber Monday . Many of the deals are also extended beyond the one Monday so shoppers have more time to save ( and less stress ) . <p> Though store employees might be thankful for clocking more hours on the job , they are n't so happy about those hours cutting into their Thanksgiving celebrations . Many stores participating in Black Friday tried to appeal to more customers this year by starting their post-Thanksgiving blowout earlier than ever before . Some retailers , like Target , Best Buy , and Macy 's , opened at midnight , while Wal-Mart let consumers rush in at 10 p.m . Thursday . This means that the employees of these stores had to cut their time with family short to be at work at the end of the day . Thousands of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but retailers say they are catering to consumer demands . If the practice of Black Friday is going to continue , we should at least make sure it does n't spill over into Thanksgiving . <p> Some of the best deals you 'll find during Black Friday are on electronics , like TVs and laptops , kitchen appliances , and clothing . The only problem is that they typically are n't brands you would consider buying any other time of the year . The TVs you might find on sale , for example , are brands like Dynex , Seiki , and Element , not the top-of-the-line brands you dream about . The prices are cheap , but the products often are , too . Kitchen appliances on sale are often more poorly made than the full-price versions and are items you wo n't use frequently , like donut makers and low-grade blenders . In terms of clothing , there 's a reason you hear the most Black Friday chatter from bargain stores ; expensive stores that carry name brands do n't offer many discounts . You 'll be buying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ More deals on big-brand products can usually be found online , eliminating the need for facing Black Friday crowds . <p> After reading through the advertisements for Black Friday deals , you 're probably drawn to some of the bigger items . If you can save $300 on a TV , why would n't you face the crowds to buy it ? Those ads normally have some fine print , though , that can make all the difference . One trick of the Black Friday retailers is that the item is offered in " limited quantities " with no rain check available . These quantities are so limited in some cases , that the stores are only required to have three or four in stock , even though they expect thousands of customers to show up . If you are fifth in line for that discounted TV , you 're out of luck . Black Friday allows stores to lure in customers with false promises , a practice that would n't be acceptable any other day of the year . <p> It kind of defeats the purpose of trying to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end up making a lot of impulse buys . The smartest post-Thanksgiving shoppers have an organized , strategic plan for the day . They know exactly what they want and prioritize the stores they 're visiting . But for less focused individuals , the deals they stumble upon can be too enticing to pass up . The problem with these impulse buys is that you do n't always know if they 're actually good deals or not . You have n't compared prices , read reviews , or thought about whether you really want the item . Even though these products are on sale , too many impulse buys will really add up , especially if you 're buying some big-ticket items . The stores themselves may be pushed into the black by all the purchases , but Black Friday 's not doing the country any good if all the shoppers are going into debt . <p> Why do we all think of Black Friday as the only day when we can save money ? Most stores , particularly in bad economic times , start their sales weeks before Thanksgiving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " doorbusters . " Early birds could find better prices than those who wait until right after Turkey Day . Other retailers keep prices low throughout the holiday season to encourage buying or even offer better sales in the weeks following Thanksgiving . For those who are n't looking for things to stuff under the tree , the weeks immediately after Christmas can provide the best prices as stores try to get rid of stock they loaded up on during the holiday season . Stores like Target and Wal-Mart add aisles of toys for Christmas that have to be cleared out immediately afterward . <p> With some of the shopping day creeping into the actual day of Thanksgiving this year , Americans have been more focused than ever on Black Friday . This includes those who eagerly planned their shopping lists for the most savings on Thursday night as well as those who petitioned the earlier start date . Either way , Thanksgiving has taken a back seat . If you take stock of the media coverage lately , much of it has looked at Black Friday as well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and where to find the best deals . Not much has been said about giving thanks or enjoying time with family and friends . If we could just end Black Friday now , that would give us all something else to be thankful for .

Push the envelope too far and you risk creating a controversy that tarnishes your brand and leaves your product out of the conversation altogether , making the advertisement totally useless . There 's nothing like a good ad , and these are really nothing like good ads . These nine promotions for various products got people talking , but the negative press did n't help people remember the product 's name . <p> The Super Seven Incher , an extra-long burger , did n't catch on like other Burger King products , even though BK tried to play on the sexy undertones of the meal .

For everyone else , though , the release of the new color should n't have made many waves . In the Netherlands , a billboard appeared to announce that the PlayStation Portable White was coming . To get attention , it showed a blonde , white woman dressed in white aggressively grabbing the face of a black woman , all in black . The racial tension and perceived domination of one race over another in the ads turned a lot of heads , but also raised plenty of complaints .

For the fashion house of Marithe and Francois Girbaud , however , it was a good starting place for an advertisement . They reimagined the painting with modern-day girls ( and one shirtless guy with sagging pants ) standing in place of Christ and his apostles . The Catholic Church in Italy , where the ad first appeared , quickly pushed Milan to ban the ad . It was subsequently disallowed in France , without much publicity for the brand . <p> Most of us think about Nivea 's skin care products as being for women , but they actually do have a line for men . Most of their advertising targets females , but earlier this year , they put out an offensive ad aimed at men in the men 's magazine , Esquire .

Apparently , the Newspaper Marketing Agency did n't quite understand its audience . In 2004 , several papers ran an ad that was supposed to attract fashion advertisers to want to do business with the dailies . It showed a large stiletto heel impaling a tiny businessman through the stomach . The image is n't especially graphic compared to violence on TV or what 's involved in the news stories the paper reports on , but readers were disturbed .

The scenarios range from crotch-grabbing to massages to ironing the man 's pants . The Tom Ford brand may have gotten attention with this tactic , but he also alienated a lot of the public who thought the ads were sexist and who felt dirty looking at nipples in otherwise tame magazines . <p> When you think about ice cream , taboo sex is obviously what comes to mind , right ?

As a small business owner myself , when I hear about another business getting sued for something they could n't possibly have prevented , it makes me squirm . I get frustrated . Frustrated to the point that I can only laugh it off as ridiculous , but later find myself having trouble looking away .

Like a tiny cut on the roof of my mouth : it really , REALLY bothers me which is why I ca n't stop licking it . <p> The true Stella awards ( named after Stella Liebeck when she successfully sued McDonalds when she severely burnt herself by spilling their coffee on her lap in the drive-thru ) are real stories , but there 's also a few fables that have made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the following stories are fake , they still have a certain believability to them. - And that thought scares me more than the reality of the true ones .

The owners of the store were understandably surprised at the verdict , considering the misbehaving tyke was Ms. Robertsons son . <h> What makes it believable : <p> The scenario seems all too common : An out-of-control toddler and a parent who is incapable or unwilling to do anything about their behavior . Assuming the store had done nothing about this childs reckless behavior despite plenty of opportunities to do so , if the child had then injured another customer , you can see how the story suddenly holds a lot more water .

The beverage was on the floor because Ms. Carson threw it at her boyfriend 30 seconds earlier during an argument . <h> What makes it believable : <p> This is another situation of whether or not contributory negligence is an adequate defense for the owner(s) of the restaurant in question . Is 30 seconds too long for a spilled drink to be on the floor before something is done to clean it up ? If it were left there for 5 minutes , would that make a lawsuit of this nature more legitimate ? Those are the questions that a jury must answer . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - staff members knowingly and repeatedly ignoring the spill , suddenly the restaurant may wind up being responsible for some of the blame . Luckily this story is fake , but alas : its not completely merit-less . <h> What we can learn from it : <p> Deal with potentially dangerous situations as they happen . Any delay in response could end up costing you ! <h> Story #3 : To save $3.50 <p> Kara Walton of Claymont , Delaware , successfully sued the owner of a nightclub in a neighboring city when she fell from the bathroom window to the floor and knocked out her two front teeth . This occurred while Ms. Walton was trying to sneak through the window in the ladies room to avoid paying the $3.50 cover charge . She was awarded $12,000 and dental expenses . <h> What makes it believable : <p> I suspect that of all of the stories in this article this one has the best chance to be based on some real life event , ( perhaps ) minus the lawsuit .

The rest of the fable is ludicrous , too , of course. - But the one thing that I wonder is : if the handbook in question might have had some images or instructions that could lead a reasonable person to believe that it was OK to leave the drivers seat while the vehicle was in motion , there 's a chance a jury could favor Mr. Grazinskis fictional claim . Even then , I must admit : this story remains a bit of a stretch. - I do n't  doubt that there are people dumb enough to do something like this , or even that theyd try to blame and sue others for their own stupidity. - What makes this story obviously fabricated is that the judge and/or jury did n't  laugh this case right out of court ! <h> What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dumb things and have a tough time admitting fault .

Understanding and predicting these fluctuations can be helpful for your financial projections . <p> Oil is another big reason weather impacts just about all businesses . Since oil demand is increased during colder winters , oil ( and thus gasoline ) prices increase making transportation more expensive .

The main types of small business insurance include professional liability , product liability , general liability , and commercial property insurance policies . Depending on the products and services provided by the company and the state in which the company is located , some types of insurance may be legally required in order to conduct business . Additionally , employers are required by law to maintain adequate workers compensation coverage on their employees and , depending on state-specific laws , may be required to offer unemployment coverage for employees as well . <p> Professional liability insurance Also known as malpractice insurance , professional liability insurance protects small businesses against financial losses due to errors or negligence on the part of the company or its employees . Professional liability insurance is required for certain professions ; for example , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maintain a certain level of professional liability insurance in order to practice medicine in most states . While not all small businesses are legally required to carry professional liability coverage , it is recommended for any company that routinely provides personal services to the general public ; these include hair salons , massage therapy centers , and gyms with personal training services . <p> Product liability insurance For businesses in the manufacturing , distribution or retail fields , product liability can represent a major risk factor ; as a result , product liability insurance is a necessity in order to protect the assets of the small business . Product liability insurance protects the company against claims for defective or malfunctioning products and is required by law for some types of products . Generally , the amount of product liability insurance required is commensurate with the level of risk involved in the particular product ; health care products and cosmetics , for example , typically entail a higher level of risk than combs , brushes and hair barrettes . General liability insurance While professional and product insurance policies cover specific risks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small business against legal claims for injuries , accidents , and libel or slander during the normal course of operations .

Commercial property insurance is available in two basic types : <p> Peril-specific insurance covers the buildings , equipment , and contents against specific types of losses including fires , floods , or vandalism , but its coverage is restricted to the specific losses enumerated on the policy All-risk policies cover buildings , equipment , and contents against damages caused by a wide range of events , but may incorporate exclusions for acts of war , floods , earthquakes , or other specific types of risk factors <p> Commercial property insurance is usually required and always recommended in order to protect the small business against catastrophic financial loss in the event of a major fire , flood , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insurance is legally required in most states for small businesses that employ one or more persons other than the owner .

Contemporary examples of these conniving campaigns include the " not-for-children " merchandising and advertising contracts of big tobacco companies , Bernie Madoff 's not-so-funny practical joke on investors , and the widespread use of carcinogenic ingredients by cosmetic companies , as this article will expose . So who exactly are these cosmetic companies , how are they getting away with poisoning their consumers , and what can anyone do about it ? <p> Major cosmetic companies like Bobbi Brown , EstTe Lauder , Bumble and Bumble , Sephora , Revlon , and dozens of others have launched breast cancer donation campaigns and fundraisers over the past decade . Conscientious consumers can purchase any manner of items , from Eveyln Lauder lip sets to pink tweezers , to contribute a portion of those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this sudden , almost unanimous change of heart is that all of these companies have been accused by prominent groups like the Organic Consumers Association of manufacturing and distributing cancer-causing ingredients in their products . Funnier still , all of these breast cancer awareness campaigns were launched very soon after the allegations began to surface in the late 90s and early 2000s . The Breast Cancer Research Fund , referenced in the link above , cites the two most dangerous cancer-causing chemicals used by cosmetic companies : parabens and phthalates . <h> Parabens <p> The word " parabens " refers to a class of preservatives that cosmetic companies use in their products . Common permutations of this preservative include butylparaben and methylparaben . As the single most heavily used preservative in the industry , parabens are found in shaving gel , tanning oils , lotions , shampoos , creams , and dozens of other cosmetic products . Their widespread applications are due to their bactericidal properties . By killing fungi , bacteria , and other microorganisms , parabens help to create and uphold the increasingly long shelf life of household @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reported the presence of parabens in the breast tumors of several subjects . Increased estrogen levels , a side effect of paraben consumption , catalyze some forms of breast cancer . So why are these cancer-causing preservatives even used when there are safe and natural alternatives like grapefruit seed extract ? Unfortunately , parabens are very inexpensive , easy to produce on a large scale , and very good at their job . They also " play well " with other preservatives and surfactants , which means that they can be easily integrated into thousands of different products . <h> Phthalates <p> Originally derived from phthalic acid , phthalates are used to " plasticize " substances , or optimize their texture for their intended uses . With phthalates , this process entails increasing or decreasing the opacity , flexibility , strength , and durability of plastic and similar materials . As the most prolific industrial ingredient , phthalates are found in toys , pills , paint , gels , wax , and of course , almost every cosmetic product imaginable . As materials containing phthalates begin to age and deteriorate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This tendency , along with its correlation to cancer , has merited several attacks from environmental and cancer advocates . The Environmental Working Group and the U.S. Center for Disease Control have reported a number of detrimental effects on humans and the environment as the result of phthalate contamination . The CDC exposed the link between phthalates and liver cancer with a 2005 study . In a separate study conducted by the Environmental Working Group , dibutyl phthalate was detected in 100 percent of test subjects . Unlike the complete failure of paraben protesters , however , the diligent efforts of advocates like the EWG and CDC resulted in the congressional ban of six phthalates in 2008 . Much more work remains to be done , of course , until all phthalates are banned . <h> Lack of Accountability of Cosmetic Companies <p> It 's obvious that parabens and phthalates are carcinogenic . Why , then , has their use not been criminalized ? The FDA 's defense for not holding cosmetic companies accountable involves the commissioning of the Federal Food , Drug , and Cosmetic Act , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Whether or not this act was written on the scorecard of a golf game between Revlon 's CEO and the top lawmakers of the day , as some advocates suggest , is yet to be revealed . Nonetheless , the only restriction that the act imposes is the banning of " adulterated " products , or those that have been proven harmful . Thus , the failure to regulate phthalates and parabens after this legislation is merely a selective oversight by a government that wants to keep its rich friends . <h> Avoiding Cancer-Causing Chemicals <p> Until increased advocacy , lobbying , and other forms of pressure prevail , the best way to boycott phthalates and parabens is to avoid them . Considering their ubiquity , the best way to do this is to purchase explicitly paraben-free cosmetic products . Several retailers offering paraben-free products , such as Parabenfreebeauty.com , have emerged to spearhead the resistance against these carcinogens . These retailers have vast inventories of paraben-free shampoo , lotion , soap , and virtually every other cosmetic and hygienic staple . Any products that ca n't be replaced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all . When buying toys or evaluating a daycare , make sure that all toys are phthalate-free . For more politically minded opponents to cancer-causing cosmetics , the aforementioned advocacy groups gladly accept new members , contributions , and information . Hopefully , with consistent pressure and increasingly health-conscious government initiatives , parabens and phthalates will plague no more people with their cancer-causing properties or pronunciations.

The strides that were made beginning in the Industrial Revolution , however , came at a high cost , as the physical and mental health of many Americans deteriorated due to unreasonably long hours and little or no time off . A centuries-long labor battle ensued , bringing forth all of the rights we 're afforded today as workers . As Labor Day approaches and you anticipate that much-needed rest remember these pivotal moments in the U.S. labor movement . <p> Although it lasted just seven years , the NLU holds the distinction of being America 's first labor union . Consisting of skilled and unskilled workers , it was organized to bring together already existing unions throughout the country to demand an eight-hour work day and press for additional reforms . Its only real taste of success came in 1868 when Congress passed a statute providing an eight-hour day for government workers , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The disintegration of the NLU strengthened the Knights of Labor , which quickly expanded after the economic depression of the mid-1870s . Opposing socialism and refusing association with radical elements , they became the first truly successful large-scale labor organization in the country , boasting membership of 700,000 in 1886 . Most notably , they advocated an eight-hour work day , sought to end child and convict labor , and in some cases , negotiated with employers on behalf of their employees . Poor organization , internal strife and Haymarket Riot contributed to their eventual demise . <p> Poor economic conditions caused northern railroad companies to cut salaries and wages , angering workers who played an essential role in the tremendous growth of our nation 's most efficient form of transportation . A walkout by the employees of the Baltimore &amp; Ohio line was followed by violent strikes in major cities such as Chicago , Kansas City and San Francisco 10 were killed , for example , in a militia melee in Baltimore . After 45 days of chaos and many more deaths , the strike ended after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> As the Knights of Labor reached their peak , a group of disaffected members came together to form the American Federation of Labor . Samuel Gompers served as the organization 's first president , a position he would hold until his death in 1924 when membership reached 3 million . Under his leadership , disharmony among different groups was kept at a minimum , and collective bargaining became the AFL 's primary strategy . A capitalist at heart , he once famously said , " The worst crime against working people is a company which fails to operate at a profit . " <p> Tensions mounted as little headway was made in the eight-hour movement and overall quest to improve labor conditions . On May 4 , 1886 , labor leaders and anarchists spoke to hoards of workers near Haymarket in Chicago . As the crowd became agitated , 170 armed police attempted to break it up , prompting an unidentified person to hurl a bomb at them . A flurry of gunfire ensued , and by the end of the fiasco , eight officers and numerous civilians were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and anti-union sentiment swept across the country . <p> The expiration of a sliding scale wage agreement between the Carnegie Steel Company and the Amalgamated Association of Iron and Steel Workers brought forth infamous The Homestead Strike . With Andrew Carnegie out of the country and the vigorously anti-union Henry Clay Frick in charge , contentious negotiations led to a lockout of the workforce , who in turn guarded the premises from the possible use of scabs . When an army of 300 strikebreaking detectives employed by Frick , also known as the Pinkertons , arrived on July 6 , workers charged them , provoking gunfire . The 13-hour battle resulted in the deaths of seven workers and three Pinkertons . In the following weeks , the company used a variety of tactics to weaken the union , eventually winning the dispute on November 17 when the AAISW voted to lift the prohibition . <p> A reduction of wages and long , arduous hours at the Pullman Palace Car Company prompted 3,000 of its employees to initiate a strike , leading to a shutdown of the factory . Assistance was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Debs , whose union members refused to run trains using Pullman cars . Railroad service in and around Chicago was disrupted , but Attorney General Richard Olney used claims of violence 13 strikers were killed during the ordeal to obtain federal troops to quell the strike . President Grover Cleveland justified the action by asserting it interfered with delivery of U.S. mail . <p> One of the major reforms passed in the New Deal , the Walsh-Healy Act covered specific employees of government contractors , establishing overtime pay for workers who exceeded eight-hour days , a minimum wage , and standards for child and convict labor . This set up broader wages and hours legislation encompassing a large number of workers throughout the nation . <p> More than five million workers participated in strikes in 1947 , forcing businesses and advocates of their rights to take action . Composed to prevent " unfair labor practices , " the Taft-Hartley Act prohibited wildcat strikes , jurisdictional strikes , political strikes , secondary strikes , large-scale picketing and union donation to federal political campaigns . President Harry Truman , who called it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bill only for it to be overridden in Congress . Multiple attempts have been made to amend the bill since its passage , but they were met with stiff opposition from Republicans . <p> Before their merger , the AFL and CIO were rivals and two of the largest labor unions in the country . However , the new leadership of George Meany and Walter Reuther reduced tensions and brought forth a more pragmatic approach from the organizations , which combined for a membership of more than 15 million . Together , they more efficiently staved off corruption , but dropped the CIO 's liberal policies regarding civil rights and jurisdictional disputes . More than five decades later , the AFL-CIO consists of 56 national and international unions , boasting 11 million members .

And while your elders may not be transitioning into the digital age with ease ( or at all ) , several of America 's oldest brands have thrived through multiple technology changes . Here are 10 well known brands that appear a lot younger than they are . <p> It 's probably not surprising that alcohol is as in demand today as ever . But Jim Beam , the familiar brand of bourbon whiskey , has maintained success as one of the top sellers of whiskey since 1795 and is one of the oldest American liquor brands . Though it faced a little hiccup during Prohibition , it picked up where it left off after the big ban ended and now produces several variations of Jim Beam whiskey .

In the early ' 90s , they held a talent contest . The winning duo : Montgomery Gentry , a band that has since been nominated for Grammy Awards and played for millions of fans . <p> Colgate started out making soaps in 1806 and has been making toothpaste since 1873 . In fact , Colgate was the producer of the first toothpaste in a tube , creating the eternal debate between spouses over whether the tube should be squeezed from the bottom or middle . As a company , Colgate joined forces with Palmolive in 1928 , but they maintained the popularity of Colgate Toothpaste . This may be due in part to Colgate 's competition with Procter &amp; Gamble 's Crest Toothpaste starting in 1955 , and the two are therefore pushed to be on the cutting edge of marketing . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gaining popularity , and they each are on top of the latest trends in oral care , such as whitening and gum care . Colgate , though , ingeniously repositioned its brand when dentists were recommending that people brush three times a day . Knowing that most people would n't follow that recommendation , Colgate Toothpaste promoted itself as " The toothpaste for people who can only brush twice a day , " giving it an edge over competition that were presumably for the thrice-a-day brushers . <p> Since Brooks Brothers first started in 1818 , which makes it the oldest clothing store in the U.S. it has seen a lot of competitors rise and fall . Created as a men 's clothing store in New York , Brooks Brothers now makes women 's , boy 's , and girl 's clothes and has stores all over the world . In the mid-1900s , the company stayed modern by providing ready-to-wear , traditional suits during a time when men wore suits almost every day . Today the company has maintained its popularity by catering to executives , politicians , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brothers remains in the public eye , worn by actors on the big and small screen . Some of these include George Clooney , Matt Damon , and Will Smith . President Barack Obama even wore Brooks Brothers accessories at his inauguration , further cementing the company 's place in modern American life . <p> When it comes to branding , Tiffany &amp; Co. may be the best in the business . This famous jewelry store was started in 1837 by Charles Lewis Tiffany and has come to be known as one of the strongest brands in the world . The company helped refine some of the traditions that go along with engagement and marriage , which has enabled it to keep its hold on the hearts of the country , or at least the women 's hearts . In 1886 , before diamonds were the traditional choice for an engagement ring , Tiffany created the Tiffany Setting diamond engagement ring , one diamond in a six-prong setting , the first of its kind . It became an iconic ring that many women dream of receiving from their boyfriends , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ symbol of exclusivity ; you can only get the robin 's egg blue box with a purchase . Tie that in with the hit movie Breakfast at Tiffany 's and the status of Audrey Hepburn as a timeless style icon , and Tiffany &amp; Co. ca n't be shaken , even in a recession . <p> Known today for their juices and apple sauce , Mott 's began in 1842 making apple cider and vinegar , pressed by a horse-powered mill . The company gained popularity by showcasing its products at world fairs and national exhibitions . The Mott 's brand has stayed on top of the latest technologies and led the country in innovating fruit products , claiming to have introduced the American palate to apple juice . The company has managed to stay modern by refocusing marketing on the concerns of the contemporary woman .

It certainly would n't be around today if it had stuck with its original business of express mail .

In the 1880s , it introduced its own money order service and started the first large-scale traveler 's check system as an alternative to letters of credit , which kept the company relevant then but are of little use to individuals today . The charge card , which is what we mainly know American Express for now , was introduced in 1958 and quickly became an indispensable financial tool . The company has been ranked as one of the top 25 most valuable brands in the world . <p> The idea for Jell-O goes all the way back to 1845 when a man got a patent for a gelatin dessert , but it was n't until 1897 that a different man , Pearle B. Wait @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wait sold the company to Orator Francis Woodward in 1899 , Jell-O 's business began to take off . Jell-O 's advertising campaigns from that point forward have kept the brand fresh . They started with salesmen going door to door to give away samples of Jell-O to housewives and have employed countless celebrities ( including Kewpie Dolls and Bill Cosby ) and marketing angles over the years . In the early 1900s , Jell-O was even served on Ellis Island to welcome new immigrants to America . Considered a children 's snack for many years now , Jell-O is currently repositioning itself as a treat for adults , too , with commercials aimed at parents . <p> The well known tractor company started with a guy named John Deere ( no surprise there ) in 1837 . Deere was a blacksmith-turned-farmer who made a steel plow to fit his needs and then began selling it .

Levi Strauss &amp; Co. patented the idea , though it was first used on denim overalls , and when the modern jeans were introduced , they were worn only by the working class of the Western U.S. But the magic of Levi Strauss is in the quality of the idea .

The original appeal of the soda is obvious , but once cocaine was removed , the brand carried Coca-Cola through to success . Even as they 've added new products and new variations of the Coke recipe , Coca-Cola has stayed modern , strangely , by playing up their classic roots . The branding has emphasized its vintage history by using the same logo since the beginning , and there is always some advertisement in circulation with a wholesome Americana feel to it . Norman Rockwell-like illustrations have shown Santa enjoying Coke from the classic glass bottle and photos of typical Americans , from cowboys to New Yorkers , enjoying Coca-Cola to promote the brand as a true American company . On the flip side of its branding , Coca-Cola has capitalized on product placement opportunities , showing that it remains a staple in modern life .

In other words : when a person covered under a self-funded plan needs medical care , the company is financially responsible for paying the medical bill ( minus deductibles ) . It 's an alternative risk transfer strategy that assumes the risk and liability of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a third party . It 's a surprisingly common practice : <p> Most ( but not all ) self-insurance plans are administered by a third party , usually a health insurance company , in order to process claims . The bills are simply paid for by the employer . Health insurance companies act as a third party administrators in what are called ASO contracts ( Administrative Services Only ) <p> Another common component of self insurance plans is stop-loss insurance . This is a separate insurance plan that the employer can purchase to reduce the overall liability of claims . With this type of insurance , if claims exceed a certain dollar amount , stop-loss kicks in paying the rest . There are two kinds of stop-loss insurance : <p> Specific covers the excess costs from larger claims made by individuals in the group <p> Aggregate kicks in when total claims by the group exceed a set amount <p> For example , a company who self-insures their $1000 employees projects $100,000 in medical care claims for the year . If they purchase aggregate stop-loss insurance for claims that exceed 120% @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pick up the bill for the remaining claims . If the company purchases specific stop-loss insurance at 200% , if any single claim exceeds $2,000 , the stop-loss pays the remainder . <h> Benefits of self-insurance <p> The employer can customize the plan to meet the specific health care needs of its workforce , as opposed to purchasing a ' one-size-fits-all ' insurance policy . <p> The employer maintains control over the health plan reserves , enabling maximization of interest income income that would be otherwise generated by an insurance carrier through the investment of premium dollars . <p> The employer does not have to pre-pay for coverage , thereby providing for improved cash flow . <p> The employer is not subject to conflicting state health insurance regulations/benefit mandates , as self-insured health plans are regulated under federal law ( ERISA ) . <p> The employer is not subject to state health insurance premium taxes , which are generally 2-3 percent of the premium 's dollar value . <p> The employer is free to contract with the providers or provider network best suited to meet the health care needs of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drawbacks to self-insurance policies : <p> Health care can be costly , so heavy claims years can be extremely expensive <p> Self insurance is n't tax deductible the same way the costs of providing health insurance is . <p> Financial benefits are long-term , particularly with an investment component . <h> Small businesses at a disadvantage <p> Self insurance is much more prevalent for larger companies mostly because it is easier to predict health care costs from a larger group . The more people in the group , the less potentially damaging a single expensive claim will be to the plan overall . That 's why less than 10% of companies with less than 50 employees use self-insurance . The graphic to the right source : businessweek.com gives a telling breakdown of its prevalence based on company size . <p> Because risk is more difficult to predict with smaller groups , stop-loss insurance is also more expensive for smaller businesses . The practice of " lasering " , or increasing deductibles for specific higher risk employees can also be much tougher on small firms . As a result , self-insurance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is for larger companies . <p> Another roadblock for small businesses is a lack of cash-flow that is necessary to finance self-insurance . This does n't mean , however , that small businesses ca n't benefit from a self-insurance plan . In fact , an increasing number of small businesses still are . But fully understanding the risks and rewards for doing so can sometimes be difficult . <h> Regulations <p> Because the only 3rd party administration of insurance ( stop-loss ) is between the employer and the insurance company directly , it is not subject to state level regulation the way traditional insurance policies are . Instead , they 're regulated by the department of labor under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act ERISA . Benefit administrators must still comply with federal standards despite the lack of state regulation . <h> California SB 1431 <p> California is considering a proposed legislation to regulate the sale of stop-loss policies to smaller businesses . On the surface , the regulation looks as though it is an attempt to prevent small businesses from taking on too much risk . But the true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generally healthier small businesses ( effectively removing them from the health insurance pool ) . This cherry-picking would theoretically cause traditional insurance premiums to become more expensive . <p> According to the SIIA , SB 1431 would prohibit the sale of stop-loss policies to employers with fewer than 50 employees that does any of the following : <p> Contains a specific attachment point that is lower than $95,000 ; <p> Contains an aggregate attachment point that is lower than the greater of one of the following : <p> $19,000 times the total number of covered employees and dependents ; <p> 120% of expected claims ; <p> $95,000 <p> This legislation would effectively limit the options of small businesses as it would force them to purchase a more expensive low deductible stop-loss policies . And according to the SIIA , with this legislation , almost no small business under 50 employees would ( nor should they ) consider self-insurance as an option . <p> If the legislation is passed in California , it has been suggested that it is only time before other states follow suit and/or enact even stricter regulations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ page dedicated to defeating the bill they say is : <p> " unnecessary and will only exasperate the problem that small employers in California face in being able to afford the rising cost of providing quality health benefits to their employees . " <p> So while self insurance can be a relatively risky option for small businesses , with legislation like this , it could no longer be a realistic option at all And , in effect : another competitive advantage big businesses will have over their smaller counterparts .

We change our minds about products as fast as we can tweet about them , so what 's cool today may not be as alluring tomorrow . This makes life hard for marketing directors since brands can lose favor with the public if they do n't predict trends correctly . Even the biggest brands are in danger of losing their cultural icon status if they do n't keep up with the times . Here are 10 big brands , recent and old alike , that simply stopped being cool . <p> In 2005 , MySpace was immensely popular , especially among teens and up-and-coming bands , and the site had an incredible 124 million users . It completely transformed the way teens interacted with each other and was innovative in the features it offered . Where else could you post that photo you took of yourself in the bathroom mirror ? But just a year later , it was beginning to lose members to the newest fad , Facebook . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their MySpace or even remembers their password . Even Facebook , the king of social networking , is losing its cool status . It 's still widely used , hitting 750 million users recently , but six million people deleted their accounts in just one month this year and many users admit they do n't really like it . And when your parents start to join " MyFace , or whatever you kids do these days , " you know the end is coming . <p> There was a period in the ' 90s when every kid in middle school and high school was clunking around in some variety of leather shoe from this British company . The punk group had the boots , the preppy kids had the sandals , and the good girls had the Mary Janes , all complete with the trademark yellow thread around the sole . Even though Doc Martens cost more than $100 ( which basically means nothing to teenagers ) , somehow kids everywhere were convincing their parents to buy them a pair . As the glory of the ' 90s faded , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probably just as ridiculous , Doc Martens found their way to the trash or buried in the closet . There have been rumors for years that Docs are making a fashion comeback , but so far only those outside of the mainstream will shell out the money for them . <p> Nokia was a pretty prominent phone brand just a few years ago and the dominant one at the beginning of the mobile phone craze . That little gadget held everything you needed in a phone : your contacts , some cool ringtones , and the game Snake . The personalized phone covers you could buy at the local mall were just the icing on this technological cake . Nokia phones accounted for 40% of the market worldwide at one point , but as technology changed , Nokia did n't change fast enough . The company still sells a large number of phones each year , but they are the basic kind that Americans use between dropping their smartphones in the toilet and getting new ones . They might also make good starter phones for adolescents , but there 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friends . <p> Slumber parties and sick days for kids used to mean a trip to the local Blockbuster to pick out a few movies . A husband could surprise his wife by taking her to the video store and letting her have her pick of chick flicks . Blockbuster was the only reasonable choice for most renters ' needs because they had a bigger selection and more copies of popular movies than the small video stores in town . But then Netflix came along . People who previously thought they 'd never be able to find a copy of Purple Rain to rent suddenly realized that their movie choices were almost endless . You do n't even have to drive to the store for your rentals anymore since it comes right to your mailbox . The final nail in Blockbuster 's coffin was the cheap and instant alternative , Redbox . Blockbuster is n't just uncool now ; it 's unprofitable . The company filed for bankruptcy last year . <p> McDonald 's is probably one of the most successful brands in the world , with its glowing golden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the company lost its seat at the cool kids ' table when Americans realized the food was making them fat . As obesity became a bigger issue in the U.S. , all the chubby fingers pointed to McDonald 's as one of the worst enablers . Lovable Ronald McDonald and Happy Meal toys had been enticing kids to gobble up lots of fried food , and the drive-thru called to busy moms . When the documentary SuperSize Me reached audiences , McDonald 's reputation was undeniably damaged . The fast food chain continues to operate around the globe , but they are trying to fix their unhealthy image with yogurt parfaits and apple options in the Happy Meals . It 's yet to be seen whether these efforts can put McDonald 's back in Americans ' good graces . <p> In the days before online shopping existed , the Sears Catalog provided an easy way for consumers to order merchandise and have it mailed to them . It was also used as toilet paper in outhouses , but that 's obviously not the cool part of the brand . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women and helped put the Sears company on the map . Sears opened stores in malls across America and eventually became associated with something else : power tools . The new Sears image was cool in a manly , rugged sort of way . If a woman dragged her husband on a shopping trip , she 'd at least humor him with a trip to Sears if he behaved . In recent years , however , the company has been losing money . It does n't help that they bought Kmart , another struggling business , in 2005 . Some business blogs are predicting that Sears wo n't make it to 2012 , but even if they do , their days in the limelight are over . <p> If there was a brand that defined the changes happening in the ' 50s and ' 60s , it was Playboy . With the recognizable bunny logo and cocktail waitresses with fuzzy tails and ears , the brand has lived on for almost 60 years . But what was once the venture of the young handsome bachelor , Hugh Hefner , has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him hanging out with Playmates gets creepier . The crazy antics of a 25-year-old are n't nearly as awesome coming from an 85-year-old . They 're just sad , and so is Playboy 's future . Hefner 's elderly image and declining magazine sales ( since the Internet has taken over every print market ) seem to point to the end of the American icon as we knew it . The new NBC show , The Playboy Club , may help the brand revisit its former glory , but it 's unlikely that it will bring it into the 21st century . <p> If you 've seen the movie A Christmas Story , you know that Ovaltine was cool in the ' 30s and ' 40s , even if only because it sponsored the Little Orphan Annie radio show ( and despite the fact that the decoder ring revealed a crummy commercial ) . Restaurants would use it in milkshakes and drinks , and kids would drink it at home in order to save up proofs of purchase to trade in for prizes . Though the product continues to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' 90s by other chocolate drink mixes . It did n't cross onto the pop culture radar again until the terribly cheesy commercials appeared in the past 10 years with the tagline " More Ovaltine , Please !

The Marlboro Man campaigns were used from 1954 until 1999 , and the rugged image they brought to Marlboro cigarettes helped bolster sales of the tobacco product . Men across America wanted to be like that cowboy and made Marlboro the leading cigarette brand . But wanting to be tough like a ranch hand does n't actually make you tough in the face of cancer .

At best , it 's a guilty pleasure ; at worst , it 's the slow destruction of our society . MTV was originally a place where America 's youth turned to discover the latest music , fashion , and pop icons , all through music videos . Today , MTV offers distractions from our own lives as we spy on the tough situations other people face . Rather than offering something to aspire to , such as being in a band like The Police or designing clothes for Madonna , viewers today are shown how not to behave through shows like Jersey Shore and 16 and Pregnant . While MTV may still have an audience , people are n't screaming that they want their MTV like they used to .

But retail theft is more common than many of us realize ; there are even organized shoplifting rings that nick millions of dollars worth of products . The crime of shoplifting costs U.S. stores $13 billion a year , which often causes the retailers to hike up prices to cover the loss . If some of the items at your local store seem a little expensive , keep your eye on shifty characters around these nine products that shoplifters most frequently target . <p> Where 's the beef ? That 's what many retailers are left wondering after a shoplifter hits . In the past several years , meat has often emerged as the top item stolen from stores , as regular shoppers and kleptomaniacs alike feel the urge to slide a steak into their coat pocket . Most meat thieves go for the higher end products , such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started hiding security tags under the price label or in the pad that soaks up the meat juice . All they really need to do though , is keep an eye out for the shopper who is being followed by a pack of drooling dogs . <p> The sharpest criminals seem to be taking razors from stores , probably because they are easy to hide and have a high resale value . And Gillette apparently is the best a thief can get . The Mach products from Gillette are always among the most taken razors since they are relatively pricey and high in demand . Americans are n't alone in this trend ; razors have ranked among the top shoplifted items in the world since at least 2003 . Only men 's razors seem to be targeted , though , so we hope that does n't mean women are starting to skip shaving altogether . <p> When you consider the fact that it costs more than $10,000 each year to take care of a child , it 's really not surprising that there 's a market for discounted infant formula @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go through eight or ten cans a month . The financial strain of that , plus everything else tiny people need , can lead some desperate parents to swipe the formula from the store or buy it from less-than-legitimate sources who probably stole it off the shelf . The powdered formula is also used in the drug world to weaken the strength of cocaine or heroin . <p> Apparently many thieves are worried about getting wrinkles . One of the top beauty products being shoplifted is Oil of Olay 's Regenerist anti-aging line . Maybe the stress of stealing is starting to show on their faces . The Oil of Olay product is only one of many cosmetic items that is frequently taken . Since mascara and lipstick are made small enough for women to carry in their purses , they are also easy to hide from store employees and security guards . Most thieves go for the more expensive make-up or hair care brands to either use or sell , causing cosmetics brands to lose as much as 2% of sales to shoplifting . <p> When kids enter their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of misbehavior . Not only are they stealing , which they were undoubtedly taught not to do , but they 're taking something they 're forbidden from having . Because of teenagers and people who may not be able to afford their booze habit , alcohol is one of the things most often stolen from stores . People who are already drunk often go for lower-end brands , but the power names in alcohol , like Grey Goose vodka and Hennessy Cognac , and trendy beverages , such as Mike 's Hard Lemonade , often fly off the shelves into sticky fingers if not locked up . <p> Many stores that sell lots of electronic gadgets have loss protection workers at the door who look like guards or bouncers . Their job is to check the receipts of people who have purchased big-ticket items ( and probably anyone who looks shady ) in order to cut down on the number of thefts . But even with their intimidating muscles , these employees have n't been able to stop the theft of laptops , which are one of the most frequently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Center found that more than 100,000 laptops have been stolen annually in recent years . When you consider the price each laptop could fetch , those shoplifters no doubt made a tidy profit . <p> Drugs from drug stores used to be stolen a lot more frequently when those containing pseudoephedrine were available over the counter , convenient for people who want to make meth without raising suspicion . While the theft of over-the-counter medicine has dropped some , these drugs are still among the most likely products to be swiped . Headache medicine , Preparation H , and heartburn tablets are some of the most popular because they can be sold easily on the gray market . Other items like pregnancy tests and weight-loss pills are often stolen because people are embarrassed to purchase them . <p> The problem with devices that are marketed as being portable ( and awesome ) is that they are also easy for crooks to carry off . For the average shopper , the idea of taking a smartphone without having the store employees completely set it up and transfer all your contacts for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it to work ? But for the tech-savvy shoplifter , taking a smartphone and jail-breaking it to make it useable can be an extremely profitable action . That 's why most retailers that sell smartphones keep them tethered to the display and lock away the ones available for purchase . And the really smart stores look into GPS applications that could allow them to track stolen phones . <p> We 've all walked out of the store with one of those bulky and impossible-to-remove security tags on an item of clothing we just bought . While it 's an inconvenience to go back in to have the tag removed , the retailer is just trying to protect one of its easily snatched goods . Since stores are required to provide a certain level of privacy when people are trying on clothes , thieves are given a space where they can go to hide items . Many shoplifters will wear baggy clothing so that they can hide the stolen clothing inside it or simply put it on under what they were wearing . This is especially easy in stores without pesky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than six items in the room at a time .

There are legitimate reasons for raising insurance premiums . For example , if it was an especially bad year for hurricanes , then there will be a significant increase in homeowners , auto and health insurance claims . To help recover the unexpected spike in payouts , the insurance companies will raise their premiums . <p> But a significant percentage of a premium increase is to help cover losses due to insurance fraud .

Unfortunately for the consumer , that money has to come from somewhere , which is part of the reason for insurance premium increases . <p> Consumers can help their own causes by becoming familiar with insurance fraud and learning how to report it .

In most cases , by the time the insurance companies have figured out what is going on , the ring of criminals has moved on to a new scam . <p> Another common form of auto insurance fraud is vehicle theft .

But millions of dollars a year in health insurance fraud are being carried out in the name of unsuspecting patients . This is one of the elements that works to keep health insurance costs so high in the United States . <h> Homeowners Insurance <p> Some forms of homeowners insurance fraud are more subtle than others .

One of the groups hit hardest by life insurance fraud is senior citizens . <p> People disguised as life insurance sales people will go out and offer bogus life insurance policies to seniors who thought that they may not qualify for life insurance .

The characters always seem to enjoy every second they 're at work and have plenty of free time for an active social life . Once you got older and started working , you probably realized these portrayals were n't exactly true to life . It 's not really as easy as they made it seem to get into the field of ice cream flavorist , and your boss probably wo n't laugh it off after you screw things up for the tenth time . Studios have put out some movies that make us feel a bit better about our jobs , like Office Space and Horrible Bosses , but we still wish we could find a job that writers made up . If these fictional workplaces existed , we 'd apply immediately . <p> There 's no one on the planet more passionate about their job than Leslie Knope , assistant director of the parks and recreation department in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organizes everything from penguin weddings to harvest festivals to unnecessary stakeouts .

Employees get to work on a wide range of projects , put ridiculous personal photos in presentations , and engage in an ongoing war with the libraries department . Basically , if you work for the parks department , you can do whatever you want and just blame it on Jerry if it goes wrong . <p> Do n't pretend like you would n't jump at the chance to work at an office in space . The bridge or command center of Star Trek 's Starship Enterprise would be a great fit for people who are very organized , can work well under extreme pressure , and do n't mind the idea of potentially dying from alien crafts or space-borne diseases .

Working in any position in The Girlie Show offices at NBC would be a dream for most people . The writers goof off all day bouncing fart jokes off each other , the actors are complimented constantly and given time off work to fulfill important tasks like creating a porn video game , and even the NBC page is seen as an important part of the team .

Wayne Enterprises is the money-maker for Bruce Wayne , or Batman , and it has several divisions within its scope of power .

But if you 've seen Empire Records , you see its appeal . Hanging out at Empire Records would be cool , but working there ( which is basically being paid to hang out ) would be even more fun . The teenage employees get to run the store , which means blasting the music while they prepare to open , making impromptu announcements over the loud speakers , and rubbing elbows ( and more ) with the famous musicians who make appearances at the shop .

Even if you enter into the company in a low-level , paper-pushing position , the possibility for promotion is huge . If a 12-year-old can get bumped up to a huge office with a secretary just by playing with toys , it seems like anyone can , especially people who like to goof off . Then you get to spend your days telling people what you think about buildings that turn into robots and Nerf guns . <p> If you 're going to spend three years and tens of thousands of dollars in law school , it seems only fair that you have the chance to end up at a law firm that does n't bore you to death .

In reality , it 's probably a stressful job with strange , neurotic co-workers and lots of thankless hours of editing interviews . We prefer the fictional version . The WNYX staff gets into ridiculous situations , makes a joke out of their jobs , and accepts each employee as one of their own , even the station 's handyman who admits to being the Unabomber .

Many employees enjoy close friendships with the family , such as the one-armed man who helps teach the Bluth children important life lessons .

Others believe the innovations in technology for promotion and distribution of music , sometimes referring to the artists themselves as " product " or " content , " are providing musicians more opportunities than ever before for making a living . Here are 10 rock stars ( well , nine plus one country music star ) who , in addition to faring well in the brave new world of the 21st century music industry , all have a gift for making good business decisions . <p> In 1977 , lite cowboy and cocaine rockers the Eagles went to court to gain control of their music publishing from their former manager and Asylum Records label head David Geffen . From the very beginning of their career , Eagles founders drummer Don Henley and guitarist Glenn Frey never pretended to be anything but ambitious , and they backed up their ambitions with a string of hit singles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eagles were selling one million albums a month , and playing hardball with their label and live concert promoters , receiving whatever they demanded as a percentage of gate ticket sales . The Eagles won their suit against Geffen and regained control of their publishing , worth tens of millions of dollars . But success has had its cost . The band 's cynicism about the music business , not to mention women and their own fans , comes through loud and clear in the lyrics to several of their hit songs . And while Eagles continue to tour , selling out stadiums is difficult to do thanks in part to our current economy . <p> A child of the Marcy Houses housing project in Bedford-Stuyvesant Brooklyn , Shawn Carter , better known as " Jay-Z , " went from releasing his first recordings on his own label , to becoming one of the most successful hip-hop artist entrepreneurs of all time . Jay-Z 's empire includes stakes in the 40/40 club chain , the New Jersey Nets basketball team , the clothing line Rocawear , and the Roc Nation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ + Times , to help perpetuate the notion of Jay-Z as a brand . " My brands are an extension of me , " Jay-Z has said . " They 're close to me . It 's not like running GM , where there 's no emotional attachment . " <p> Nine Inch Nails , formerly on Interscope Records , are among a handful of top-selling artists , who have recently chosen to manage and release their music themselves instead of under the auspices of a major label . Nine Inch Nails front man and mastermind Trent Reznor is currently exploring a variety of ways to finance and perpetuate the Nine Inch Nails " brand , " including allowing fans to video tape concerts , and releasing recordings , sometimes for free or pay what you will , under a Creative Commons license , allowing for remixes of the material .

The scope of her talents , which include singing , songwriting , fashion designing , dancing , and acting , is mind blowing , linking her to other great multifaceted female entertainers , like Josephine Baker , Judy Holiday , and Marilyn Monroe . However , in spite of her reputation and skill at artistic appropriation , Madonna 's accomplishments in the music industry as a woman , including creative and financial control of her brand , are unprecedented . <p> It 's safe to say that without Madonna , there would be no Katy Perry , although the two so far have yet to collaborate or , perhaps more surprisingly , share a smooch or two . Perry 's estimated net worth , $44 million , seems a paltry sum compared to the Material Girl 's moola .

Grossman began managing Dylan after he 'd already achieved significant success in the folk music community . But Dylan had ambitions bigger than being the world 's best-loved folk singer . In his book , The Mansion on the Hill , Fred Goodman writes , " Grossman 's greatest achievement was creating a commercial environment in which his clients could make a lot of money but preserve their integrity .

Their upcoming merchandising blitz , which includes an elaborate online video game , will give birth to a new generation of Deadheads . <p> OK , so Parton is n't a rock musician , but country and early rock and roll are close like kissing cousins , so we think she belongs on this list . Parton 's business acumen is formidable , and probably underestimated , perhaps because of her blond , bubbly , and buxom public image .

Then you forgot to send it and now realize that the person 's birthday is only a day or two away . No sweat ; everyone does this . Just drop it in the mail . Well , those days of looking like you 're on top of everything are over . The United States Postal Service announced recently that it will be shutting down more than half of its mail processing centers and wo n't even bother trying to deliver a letter in one day anymore . The agency 's financial problems are really starting to catch up with it , and frankly , we all might be better off without the USPS .

If you 've got a horse with a broken leg that ca n't work anymore , you shoot it and put it out of its misery . <p> The video rental company has made some major slip-ups in the past year , one of them being that customers had to choose between getting DVDs in the mail and streaming videos online or pay for both separately .

With capitalism in place , businesses are rewarded for being innovative , hiring motivated workers , and finding efficient methods . Companies that succeed in these areas earn more money and are able to keep doing business . But the postal service 's spirit of innovation is suppressed on all sides . Workers do n't feel the push to come up with new ideas because they do n't feel the need for the business ( or more accurately , government agency ) to compete with others . Leaders who want to shake things up find they are seriously restricted by regulatory constraints . Other countries ' post offices are coming up with ideas that make use of new technologies . Sweden , for example , is swapping out stamps for text message payments . Our nation would be better off with a business model that changes with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decades behind . <p> If you 've ever asked an acquaintance , co-worker , or long-ago friend where your invitation to their wedding/birthday party/son 's bar mitzvah is , they probably used the good old stand-by , " Oh , it must 've gotten lost in the mail . " It 's genius , really . They obviously do n't want you at their event , but it 's completely believable that the mail service could 've thrown your invitation in the bin destined for some faraway land bearing no resemblance to your address . You 're left to wonder whether they actually enjoy your company or not . With the USPS gone , hopefully the mysterious disappearance of letters will stop , too , and we will finally get to be told what others really think .

The slower delivery service and soon-to-be abandoned processing centers will save $2.1 billion , almost enough to keep the outdated carrier afloat but barely making a dent in the projected $14.1 billion budget deficit .

Let 's just cut our losses right now . <p> Most of us can probably count on one hand the number of times we use a stamp each month . Some of us might only use a handful of stamps each year . So how is it that these little stickers can be so annoying ? Besides the fact that we buy books full of them and then misplace them or do n't have them when we need them , the price is constantly going up . Forever Stamps have eased the pain for some , but you 've probably experienced the tricky situation at least once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you only have the old stamps with you . The only solution is to suck it up , put two stamps on , and pay almost double . Slightly heavier or bulkier cards and letters are also confusing . And how much do postcards cost ? We really do n't need to be using our brain power on this . <p> The first post offices in the American colonies were set up in 1692 to collect and distribute packages and communication among colonists and between them and England . Benjamin Franklin became the first real Postmaster General of the U.S. , because there was n't an efficient and trusted way to deliver messages or goods . There were n't always roads to the letter 's destination , so post roads were established . Telephones , cars , and the radio did n't exist . The postal service was an essential communications service and the government needed to ensure its success . Now , though , no one receives urgent messages in the mail . It 's really only used for niceties , junk mail , and the occasional bill . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handle them more efficiently . <p> The term " going postal " did n't pop up out of nowhere . It came from the frightening and deadly outbursts from stressed-out USPS workers . In 1986 , a postman in Oklahoma killed 14 workers at his post office and then shot himself . A Michigan postal worker was fired for getting into arguments with customers on his mail route and then killed five people in his local office in 1991 . On a single day in May 1993 , two postmen in Michigan and California killed coworkers . These are only a few of the dozens of examples . A job that causes this many people to snap seems like reason enough the postal service should be phased out . Even though it will mean cutting jobs , ultimately those employees could be better off . <p> At least your email has a semi-effective spam filter . The USPS , though , does n't care what they shove in your mailbox as long as they get paid . It 's hard to blame them since they are billions of dollars in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happier when you have a pile of coupons , catalogs , and cards waiting for you every day when you come home .

The average U.S. household gets about 40 pounds of junk mail every year , and we of course throw most of it away almost immediately . Getting rid of the current system might discourage bulk mailings and unsolicited advertisements . <p> No one at a post office is happy to be there , possibly excluding the toothless homeless man who is loitering outside . The workers are unhappy , the customers standing in the undoubtedly long line are unhappy , even the faces staring out from the special edition stamps seem unhappy . It 's a strange phenomenon that going into a post office immediately changes your mood . Maybe it 's because we always think ( fine , hope ) that our visit will be fast . Maybe it 's because the people working at the desk always seem to give off the vibe that they really do n't care if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of this wretched place .

As a major source of capital for a startup , an angel investor is a perfect way to bridge the gap between the money lent from friends and loved ones and an actual venture later on .

With financial backing from the company , they are free to explore ideas without the added stress of acquiring funding for their work . They can also utilize the mind power and skill of those working in the company . The Skunk Works intrapreneurship at Lockheed Martin is one of the most well-known examples of successful intrapreneurship . Franchises may also be considered a form of intrapreneurship because a parent company provides backing for the otherwise independent business . <p> A business incubator helps a startup acquire cheap leases for their business , secretarial help by the hour , insurance plans , networking with other entrepreneurs , and other support .

An LLC must be officiated by the state . Funding for an LLC can be raised by selling off membership interests . With an enormous number of benefits , the LLC may be the wiser route to go than the corporation . <p> The Service Corps of Retired Executives , known as SCORE , provides free counseling to aspiring entrepreneurs .

For example , charitable organizations , social welfare , and clubs are among the many types of nonprofits that can qualify for exemption . Nonprofit organizations are essential to community fortification . <p> The burn rate is the negative cash flow within a company over time . It is generally tabulated monthly . A company with high cash burn rates can be bad news for an investor , given that it indicates that a company is n't self-sustaining .

His passion for creating helped to spread the use of electricity and lighting at a time when electrical lighting was a rarity .

It was during this time that Edison lost most of his hearing . There are a number of different stories about the actual cause of his hearing loss .

One year later he merged his company with Gold and Stock Telegraph Co. and started another company to manufacture stock printers , called the Newark Telegraph Works . During this time he made and patented many improvements to telegraphs and even created an electric pen in 1875 . The electric pen had declining success until 1880 when others produced electric pens that did not require a battery as Edison 's invention did . <p> In 1877 , as the result of experimentation with the telephone and telegraph , Thomas Edison invented the phonograph .

He is known as the creator of the incandescent light bulb and bringing electric light to the streets and homes . In 1879 , after experimenting with numerous types of lighting elements called filaments at his Menlo Park lab , he developed a lamp that used a carbon conducting element which received an electric current to produce light inside of a globe-shaped glass container . The resulting light bulb proved to be stable , lasting over 13 hours .

In the same year , he established a power station on Manhattan 's Pearl Street to generate electricity for New York street lights and homes . Only five years later there were more than a hundred stations in America alone , which Edison owned and operated . <p> In 1888 , Edison began working on a motion picture device that would " do for the eye what the phonograph does for the ear .

While capitalism is a complex term , it is essentially a system where the hard-working individual is rewarded while the lazy are punished . Opponents of capitalism argue that the capitalist businessman is selfish and that society would benefit more if the greater good was considered rather than the individual . Inadvertently or not , we are drawn to these themes in film , perhaps to see the American Dream played out and cringe at its inevitable downfall . <p> Wall Street is the most obvious in its desire to expose the evils of capitalism , as the characters within it have the most palpable downfall .

At the expense of loyalty to his father and his father 's company , Fox is temporarily charmed by Gekko and his ideals , but ultimately realizes his mistakes in dismantling his father 's business . Fox is fortunate enough to overcome his greedy nature , undergoing a significant character arch , but is still subject to the consequences of his errors when he is arrested for his insider trading . <p> The film depicting Mark Zuckerberg 's rise to fame through the creation of Facebook and the ensuing lawsuits and betrayal of his close friend Eduardo is another great stab at modern capitalism . The Social Network takes a more complicated stance , though , as Zuckerberg may be unlikable , but his ambition should be rewarded . But to what extent should credit have been given to supporting roles ? The film allows you to make this choice , and this is a key component of what anti-capitalists put in check . At the expense of wanting to strip all credit of Facebook from Eduardo and the Winklevoss twins , Zuckerberg distances himself from others . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brouhaha that surrounds fame , in part from Sean Parker 's influence .

Bateman is wealthy , partaking in the fruits of his labor , but they are unsatisfying to him because he lives in excess .

We hear story after story about corporate greed and bonuses for the super-rich execs , but we often miss out on hearing what corporations and big companies are doing right . Many of them have great philanthropic values and compassionate hearts buried beneath all that money . These companies are examples of some of the most generous in the U.S. , based on information collected by The Chronicle of Philanthropy using each business ' giving totals for 2010 and profit data for 2009 . They 've made it part of their missions to give back to the communities they serve , a lesson companies and individuals everywhere should take to heart . <p> You might get excited when you see the savings you get back by using a Kroger Plus card , but the company is also giving a huge percentage back to the community . Kroger gave $64 million to charity in 2010 , which comes out as 10.9% of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much as some larger companies , but they 're definitely sharing one of the biggest slices of their profit pie . Besides charitable donations , Kroger organizes fundraising so members of the community can also give and sponsors races that help fund cancer research . <p> The retail giant known for rolling back prices has been a major player in the world of charitable donations . In terms of total dollars given , Walmart is one of the most generous , donating $319 million in 2010 , the most recent data year . It may not be a huge chunk of their $22 billion 2009 profit , but there 's no doubt it 's helping immensely , especially since the company notes that they also donate food and other products that are n't reflected in the monetary calculation . Their 2011 contributions were probably just as impressive as the previous year , considering they gave away $1.5 million in cash during the holidays via Facebook alone . <p> If you could count the Macy 's Thanksgiving Day Parade as a charitable donation to society , the department store might skyrocket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is , Macy 's comes in among some of the top givers . In 2010 , they donated $41 million , which was about 8.1% of their profits . Most gifts are given to organizations in Macy 's core focus areas : arts and culture , education , environment , HIV/AIDS research , and women 's issues . While the money is important , Macy 's employees also gave upwards of 122,000 hours of their time to community service , which some might argue makes even more of an impact . <p> Investment banking firm Goldman Sachs knows how to manage money , and for them , that includes giving a hefty amount to charity each year . In 2010 , the company donated $312 million , and it gave around $500 million the year before . These huge chunks of change are focused on four areas : honoring service and veterans , helping communities , expanding educational opportunities , and encouraging growth in the economy .

The total when you take the product donations into account : $3 billion . Other drug companies like Oracle and Merck also contributed significant amounts of their pharmaceuticals to the uninsured and underinsured . <p> Safeway is another smaller grocery store that 's making a big difference in the communities it serves . In 2010 , the company gave 7.5% of its profits to charity , which totaled $76.5 million . In addition to this money , they say they gave $130 million worth of food to aid hunger relief programs .

The heart of their altruism lies beyond the monetary contributions in the volunteer hours logged by workers . Employees help build homes , organize food drives , and encourage area students to pursue education and leadership roles , among other tasks depending on the needs of each branch 's community . <p> One of the largest banks in the nation ( and also one of the biggest companies in general ) is also one of the most generous . Bank of America gave away $208 million in donations in 2010 , a respectable 4.8% of their overall profits .

The bank also pushes employees to give their time to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Initiative , and provides its associates ' expertise through its Philanthropic Solutions team . <p> Even when a company has some very visible charitable projects , there are sometimes many more going on behind the scenes . Most of us know about General Mills ' Box Tops for Education program , which allows people to clip box tops of General Mills ' and the program 's corporate partners ' products to earn money toward their local school . But the company has also contributed to other programs throughout the world that you 've probably never heard of , like providing water cellars so Chinese families can collect and store rainwater , contributing to a school in Thailand , and planting vegetables in Puerto Rico . These acts , as well as the $82 million the corporation donated in 2010 , earned General Mills the 2010 President 's Award from the Committee Encouraging Corporate Philanthropy . <p> Target giving starts within the company .

Aside from highlighting gloomy numbers that say 50% of all small businesses fail in the first five years , statistics also point toward the reasons why a business might fail , which are usually a combination of critical factors . Though you really ca n't predict the outcome of your new business , you can avoid some obvious and not-so-obvious pitfalls that contribute to start-up disasters .

You need to pivot your idea according to the wants and needs of the consumer , and according to what 's most efficient and practical at the time . <p> Sometimes the " build it and they will come " mentality does n't apply to all facets of business start-ups .

Timing is also critical . <p> While it 's nearly impossible or very difficult to run your business as the only founder , having too many founders is also a mistake .

For one , it gives access to information that could potentially be considered grounds for discrimination should the employee not be hired .

They could do whatever they wanted on privacy if they wanted to , and you would n't know it until they published their text afterward . There is no protection here . " <p> A separate legislation could still be introduced , and based on Senator Schumer 's open letter , the reasoning for the objection to the failed amendment , as well as its relatively close vote , there 's still a good probability for a federal law in the near future .

Asking for a Facebook password can give access to a candidate 's private messages , advertising account information , and a number of sensitive controls . Additionally , it gives access to Facebook friend 's information , which brings up the issue of their expectation and right to privacy as well . <p> Job seekers and candidates should never feel required to give potential employers their Facebook password . It is , first and foremost , a breach of the website 's terms of service . It could also be considered an invasion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as they have not consented to 3rd party access to the accessible private information ( private messages , " friend-only " access , etc . ) .

I like candidates that keep current on their industry 's publications , news and advice ; but I love those who contribute to them . <p> Showcase your passion .

Make personal business cards if you have to , set goals if you must , but meet as many new people in your industry as you can . Everything else is just an excuse . <p> Network online . This day and age , even CEO 's tweet and sites like LinkedIn are a tremendous networking resource for professionals . With the ability to connect with industry peers who can help find and refer job openings , there might be no better way to find ( and get ) your ideal job . <p> Networking is an ongoing process ; It 's not just for job seekers .

They always did what they wanted to do no matter what other people had to say about it , they also took chances , and the majority of them paid off and helped them become a success . The leadership qualityis something everyone must possess to survive in the fast paced and competitive business world , the leaders and the free thinkers are the ones that excel while the followers and copycats fail . It is not hard to be a leader , just forget what you have learned from others that may have taught you how they did things .

Most widescale chaos like this involves years of increasing tension surrounding certain issues , but there 's always one incident that pushes the mob over the edge . Some of the last straws seem trivial , while others are obviously maddening . Here are 10 of those pivotal moments that got out of hand and led to deadly riots . <p> The riots that have exploded across London started in the northern area of Tottenham when police killed a 29-year-old named Mark Duggan . Duggan was a known offender and was being followed by police on Aug. 4 , 2011 . The police claim that when they moved in to arrest Duggan , he fired at them , hitting and wounding an officer . The police then shot the man . Many doubts , however , have surfaced about whether the man was even armed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ members , about 300 people gathered in front of the police station to demand justice for his death . This community protest quickly escalated into full-out riots , with looting , Molotov cocktails , and unimaginable damage . Many speculate the underlying issues involve the high rate of unemployment for young adults and race tension . <p> In Los Angeles in 1992 , three white police officers were acquitted in the death of Rodney King , who had died after a police chase and reportedly being brutally beaten by the officers . The jury 's verdict enraged thousands of people across the city , and they rioted for six days . Several motorists were pulled from their cars and beaten by angry mobs , and crowds set fire to buildings and vehicles . The danger was so great that the mayor set a curfew and closed schools and businesses . U.S. Army soldiers and Marines were called to the city to help restore order . When all was said and done , 53 people were dead , 2,000 were injured , and L.A. had $1 billion worth of damage to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protest if a daily Bible reading was going to be added to school curriculum , but in 1844 , the rumor that Catholics were trying to take the Bible out of public schools led to a deadly riot . Known as the Philadelphia Nativist Riots , the violence originated when nativist groups began the no-more-Bible rumor in a time of rising anti-Catholic sentiment . At a nativist rally on May 6th , the Irish-Catholic immigrants squared off against the nativists . The riot resulted in 14 people dead , 50 injured , and two Catholic churches destroyed . And these Americans did n't learn their lesson ; other riots broke out later in the year between the same groups . <p> In 2005 , some boys were playing near a power substation in a Paris suburb . Police were called to investigate a break-in at a construction site , and the boys fled when they saw the police , thinking they were being chased and would be interrogated . Two of the boys ran into the power substation to hide and were electrocuted . Their deaths led to riots lasting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's frustration over rising unemployment and police harassment . Nearly 9,000 vehicles were burned in the chaos , and about 2,900 rioters were arrested by police . French President Jacques Chirac declared a state of emergency to try to restore order . In the end , 274 towns were affected by the riots and at least one person had been killed . <p> The famous Boston riot in 1770 that is now known as the Boston Massacre started with a misunderstanding over a wig . Of course there was building tension between colonists and British soldiers , but the event that triggered the deadly chaos involved a wigmaker 's apprentice who accused a soldier of skipping out on payment for his hairpiece . The soldier denied it , and the apprentice eventually went to get a posse of colonists to confront the man again . The crowd began to grow , and though the colonists originally threw harmless snowballs at the soldiers , some eventually used clubs to hit them . The soldiers then fired into the crowd , killing five rioters and injuring others . Is that where the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the deadliest riots in history occurred in Mumbai , India , in 1992 , often referred to as the Bombay riots . It began when the Babri Mosque was destroyed during a Hindu political rally , though it 's still unclear whether the demolition was planned or the rally just got out of hand . The leveled mosque outraged Muslims , many of whom blamed Hindus for the act and rioted against them . Many Hindus were killed in brutal ways , which caused a Hindu backlash against the Muslims , keeping the rioting going for weeks . When the smoke cleared , an astounding 900 people had been killed by police gunfire , stabbings , arson , and other horrendous acts . <p> During the Civil War , Abraham Lincoln passed stricter laws on who could be drafted to fight . Because black men were n't considered citizens , they could n't be entered into the draft . Combine this with the fact that many white , working-class men felt their jobs were being threatened by black workers and that wealthy people could buy their way out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . During draft week in 1863 , after the new laws had been enacted , riots broke out , first with men attacking government buildings and then escalating to assaults on black men and apparent sympathizers for a week . About 120 civilians were killed because some men would rather risk dying in the streets than on a battlefield . <p> At the Altamont Speedway Free Festival in 1969 , the audience had been listening to music and consuming their drugs of choice all day . By the end of the festival when the Rolling Stones took the stage to perform their set , the crowd began to get unruly and pushed their way to the front and tried to get on stage . During the band 's " Sympathy for the Devil , " some fights broke out . By the performance of " Under My Thumb , " the crowd grew even rowdier and after one man was kept off the stage by security guards ( who were Hells Angels being paid in beer ) , the man drew a gun . He was stabbed and then stomped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , unaware of the killing , kept playing through their set because they were afraid the disorder would explode if they quit early .

They found 82 people throwing a party for two returning Vietnam veterans . The cops decided to arrest all the party-goers and attracted a crowd as they led them from the establishment . This crowd turned into a full-scale riot , complete with looting and fires . Despite the news media 's lack of reports on the rioting , the turmoil spread throughout the city . Michigan State Police , the National Guard , and paratroopers were called in to control the violence . Much of the disturbance is blamed on the dissatisfaction of the black community with services provided to them , like education , housing , and employment .

When people tried to take the officers ' bicycles and surrounded the police and paramedics , the crowd was told to disperse and a riot squad was brought in . They dispersed tear gas throughout the crowd . Though no one died in the rioting , about 200 people were injured ; one guy was even in a coma with permanent brain damage after being hit by a plastic bullet . Pretty violent for Canadians , eh ?

It prepares the students and provides integral hands-on experience on how the national economy functions . Classroom economy also helps to instill a stronger sense of responsibility in students , nurturing them to grow up to become more responsible adults . Let 's take a deeper look at classroom economies . Economics is an elementary part of social studies curriculum but it can be hard for younger students to grasp the principles of economics . In this sense , a classroom economy can invigorate the education process by serving as a fun way for students to act as economists as well as consumers in a classroom setting . A classroom economy can help to promote an understanding of basic economics principles and it also functions as a simple behavior management system wherein students become more responsible financially . <h> Objective of Class Economy <p> With the help of a classroom economy , students will : <p> Compare their classroom economy system over history and time . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Evaluate the importance of their classroom tasks along with their daily responsibilities . <p> Be taught about the importance on saving money . <p> Understand that every decision has an opportunity cost . <p> Participate in designing their classroom economy to mirror activity in the real world . <p> Learn how to make a budget of their funds and balance their bank accounts . <p> Study the economic trends in their classroom economy . <p> Observe the behavior of classmates as consumers to learn about the law of demand . <p> Learn about how inflation works and how it affects their classroom economy . <h> How Students Can Earn Money <h> Pay from Their Class Jobs <p> In the classroom management system , students can decide how much is a particular job worth , and through the system , they can establish a pay scale .

@@9124986 @2324986/ <h> Digital Rights Management ( DRM ) A digital copyright debate @qwx124540 <p> A new web standards proposal ( pictured below ) could bring DRM to HTML5 video . The proposal , backed by Google , Microsoft , and Netflix , creates a framework to DRM capabilities into the HTML5 video standards . And while the backing of these companies is a sign that such a proposal has legs , in its current form , it 's unlikely to make it into the standard . <p> The current proposal certainly has it 's critics , being called " unethical " by by Ian Hickson , the WHATWGs HTML spec editor , for one . But the issue has reignited the broader debate regarding DRM as a means for protecting copyright owners as a whole . Proponents claim DRM is necessary to help deter copyright theft of digital content , while opponents argue that it only limits paying customers from legitimate uses of the content and is in many cases anti-competitive . <h> What is DRM ? <p> Digital Rights Management ( DRM ) is a set of access control @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ designed to limit the use of the content after its sale . The goal of DRM is to prevent consumers from being able to freely copy ( digitally ) so as to ( presumably illegally ) distribute the licensed content . <p> A common example of DRM is that found in today 's DVDs and Blu-Ray discs . The encryption is designed so you ca n't simply copy the movie to a digital file on your computer that can be further copied to another and watched ( without the decryption ) . Instead , the file can only be played directly from the disk and only on devices that contain the decryption ability . ( e.g. Blu-ray , DVD players ) <h> Why DRM is bad for consumers <p> The main problem with DRM is that it essentially creates compatibility issues for legitimate consumers of copyrighted ( DRM enabled ) content . In today 's world , it is common to own a number of devices with the ability to play digital files such as music and movies . From a consumers perspective , DRM limits the ability of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It leads to a fragmented media experience for legitimate customers of protected products that users must n't endure with other DRM free formats . <p> This dynamic also leads to another major criticism of DRM : that it naturally leads to anti-competitive practices . For example : iTunes uses its proprietary DRM fairplay for all videos and still 20% of music downloads . The only way to play these files is through iTunes on an approved computer or synced Apple device . Even burning to CD or DVD format is n't allowed . This closed system has enabled Apple to use the power of its market share in the handheld media player industry as a competitive advantage in the digital music industry ( and vice versa ) . A situation that highly beneficial to Apple , while being a major inconvenience to consumers and providing little security for copyright owners . <p> As with most DRM encryption , it takes only a little effort to circumvent . But now , most of such solutions are explicitly illegal as per the Digital Millennium Copyright Act . Which brings us to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't work . There 's always a way around it . If media can be played , it can be copied . It 's a simple fact . It 's why songs and movies can be found on illegal download sites just seconds after they are released ( even with heavy DRM restrictions ) . DRM does n't prevent copyright infringement . It only makes it slightly less convenient to create the first " illegal copy " from that specific source . Though that seems to be enough to convince some copyright holders . <p> " Amazon 's new movie download service is called Unbox and it outlines what DRM implies . The user agreement requires that you allow Unbox DRM software to monitor your hard drive and to report activity to Amazon . These reports would thus include a list of : all the software installed ; all the music and video you have ; all your computer 's interaction with other devices . You will surrender your freedom to such an extent that you will only be able to regain control by removing the software . But if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your movies along with it . You are restricted even geographically , and you lose your movies if you ever move out of the USA . You of course have to agree that they can change these terms at any time . Microsoft 's newly upgraded Windows Media Player 11 ( WMP11 ) user agreement has a similar set of terms . " <h> The business case for embracing DRM <p> Even though DRM is n't a perfect solution to protecting copyright , there are some merits for it to be tolerated in certain applications . One of the more common current applications of DRM is particularly useful for streaming content . DRM can be used to manage subscription based &amp; other tiered licensing pricing models for streaming licensed content . A number of popular services such as Netflix , Hulu , Spotify , and many more use DRM to give access to streaming music and movies on a subscription basis . Even though this model still limits your access to compatible devices , the most successful services ( such as netflix ) have done a good job of fostering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ based business model works so well is that consumers have fewer expectations of what the will be able to do with the content . The DRM works without most consumers having any idea that it even exists because there is no expectation of being able to download a file to play elsewhere . Consumers understand they have access to the media only as long as they are paying the subscription fee . It 's like Disney Exectuive Peter Lee said in 2005 advocating a unified DRM format : <p> " If consumers even know there 's a DRM , what it is , and how it works , we 've already failed , " <p> The only thing holding these services back is lack of device compatibility , something that web standards seeks to solve by including web video in HTML 5 . What a DRM friendly video web standards proposal could do is further embrace and unify formats which would improve portability and compatibility among a greater variety of devices . Especially for services that require DRM implementation in order to license the content from owners &amp; studios who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ value of content protection and DRM , they are requirements we must fulfill in order to obtain content from major studios for our subscribers to enjoy . Although we do n't  have a common platform security mechanism and DRM , we are able to work with individual handset manufacturers to add content protection to their devices . Unfortunately , this is a much slower approach and leads to a fragmented experience on Android , in which some handsets will have access to Netflix and others wont . This clearly is not the preferred solution , and we regret the confusion it might create for consumers . However , we believe that providing the service for some Android device owners is better than denying it to everyone . <p> Further , making room for DRM in web standards would foster participation ( rather than rejection ) of the internet as a medium for delivery by television and movie studios . Blu-ray was backed by most hollywood studios over HD-DVD format because of it 's strong DRM encryption . As a result , the blu-ray format succeeded where HD-DVD went the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even the framework ) for similar protection , perhaps we 'll see a more robust marketplace for video online rather than an industry that prefers to go toe-to-toe with the internet through laws like SOPA and PIPA.

Fast forward to today , and the debate rages on , only now " Obamacare " is a reality , and the debate has made its way into the higher courts . More specifically , the individual mandate portion of the bill that requires health insurance coverage by law for most Americans by 2014 . <p> A number of recent decisions by higher courts have resulted conflicting opinions . The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit in Virginia overturned a lower court 's decision that the mandate was unconstitutional stating that the state of Virginia did n't have the authority to challenge it . The decision , did n't ( however ) comment on whether the mandate was or was not constitutional . In fact , part of the decision even stated : <p> " The significance of the questions at issue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case to reach the merits . This is not such a case , " <p> Meanwhile , one of the more closely watched cases involving this debate was decided in the 11th circuit and was among the first to conclude that the mandate was in fact unconstitutional . With the varying decisions among the appellate courts , the next logical step is for the supreme court to weigh in on the subject once and for all . Something that some predict could happen as soon as October . <p> It seems both sides agree that the continually increasing number of uninsured individuals is a problem that needs addressing , but what they ca n't agree upon is how to solve that problem . A recent GOP debate question raised some eyebrows when the tea party sponsored audience members made their feelings clear on how to handle the willfully uninsured : <h> We want to know what YOU think : <p> Does or should the U.S. constitution restrict the government 's ability to federally mandate health insurance ? Does the constitution protect your right to not purchase health insurance coverage ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ require health insurance ? Do the uninsured cause too much drain on the rest to allow it ?

And for the most part , many of such predictions are relatively accurate . But what about those that stick around even through those tough times ? Brands that found themselves , in one way or another , fading in popularity ; and for one reason or another , are still around today . Brands that simply have n't , and perhaps never will , go away Here 's our top 6 : <h> RCA <p> RCA has one of the richest and most interesting histories for any American brand . Starting with the Radio Corporation of America 's unconventional formation by General Electric in 1919 , their involvement in multiple anti-trust resolutions , the the companies multiple twists and turns resulting in its eventual demise . That 's right : RCA ( the company ) has not been around since 1986 when General Electric re-acquired the property and sold off the pieces . And still , the brand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the french conglomerate Technicolor SA ( Thomson SA ) and the RCA name is licensed to a number of different companies as per the separate RCA product lines , most notably RCA records ( SONY ) , and their consumer electronics lines . It 's a brand so powerful and engrained in society that it survived nearly 30 years after the company 's demise and is seemingly going strong . <h> Fruit of the Loom <p> The widely popular clothing brand mostly known for their undergarments got it 's start back in the 1850 's , about 20 years before trademark law were passed in the U.S. In fact , their trademark number of 418 makes it one of the oldest surviving trademarks today . Getting started as a textile mill , the brand came about when owner Robert Knight was told by a friend , who sold cloth from his mill , that when his daughter painted a red apple on the cloth , it sold better . Mr. knight then used the symbol as his logo and as inspiration for the " Fruit of the Loom " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't go so well for the company , however . Reporting half a billion dollars in losses in 1999 , Fruit of the Loom filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy . A couple years later , Warren Buffet came to the brand 's rescue and purchased it from bankruptcy . Since then , the clothing line has surged and even buying up competitors and expanding its line . This is perhaps one of the most stable brands on the planet ( that you hear very little about ) . <h> Old Spice <p> Almost completely opposite from the above brand , Old Spice saved itself from fading into obscurity by starting what has become the boldest and most talked about marketing campaigns of the new century . Believe it or not , the first Old Spice product , when the company got started in 1937 , was actually for women . A year later , old spice released it 's after shave lotion which quickly became a staple in every household in America . Facing the very real fact that their product was only still popular in aging generations , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marketing strategy . <p> Today , Old Spice has expanded its line to a number of deodorants , sprays , and shower gels for men . This along with numerous clever and strangely entertaining advertising and marketing campaigns , your grandfather 's favorite after shave brand has positioned itself as an industry leader in the newer generations as well . Old Spice : you 're doing it right . <h> R/C " Royal Crown " <p> Royal Crown is one of those brands that simply seems satisfied being in perpetual 3rd place . Another American staple , R/C 's history goes as far back as 1905 when a pharmacist named Claude Hatcher decided to make his own line of soft drinks following a disagreement with a local bottler . Originally called Union Bottling Works , the first line of drinks " Royal Crown Ginger Ale " later gave way to the eventual re-branding of their company as " Royal Crown " in 1959 . Shortly after , they became the first company to develop a sugar free diet cola . <p> In the past 30 years , the R/C company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the brand is barely even a participant in the ongoing " cola wars " . Rather , R/C sits on the tradition of its 100+ year old brand and worldwide bottling infrastructure seemingly satisfied to let Coca-Cola and Pepsi spend millions on marketing to fight for that #1 spot . Perhaps R/C wo n't ever be the most popular brand of soft drink , but it probably wo n't ever go away either . <h> Buick <p> The oldest active American made auto brand , Buick is a company that is synonymous with reliability . Sold as a premium brand under General Motors , Buick , like most of the companies on our list never fully distinguished itself as " top dog " . Rather , they carved themselves a comfortable niche as an automaker that made unassuming vehicles with above average performance , but with a focus on quality craftsmanship . <p> Domestically , Buick sales peaked in the mid 80 's , with a slow decline in the years that followed . Consolidating it 's line of models , the automaker focused on it 's signature makes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large part to China , Buick 's largest market , it remained a profitable brand for General Motors even if the parent company ( overall ) was not . In recent years , Buick begun reshaping it 's product lines to focus on younger demographics and thanks to being called the most reliable car brand in 2009 ( tied with Jaguar by J.D. Power and associates ) it became the fastest growing car company of 2010 helping propel GM back to it 's #1 automaker spot . <h> AOL <p> Perhaps not necessarily a " staple " like many of the rest on our list , America Online was a big player in the early growth of dial-up internet service providers , particularly in the 90 's . And despite numerous customer service issues including a notoriously tough cancellation policy and the billing disputes that followed to the mockingly branded " Always Off-Line " due to service issues , the popularity hit its peak at around 2002 . <p> Since then , however , AOL has gone through a very notable rough patch with it 's ISP service practically disappearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has re-purposed itself as a content provider instead , going for online advertising revenue to sustain the brand .

It may be that you do n't want to work but have to , due to the current economic climate or other reasons beyond your control . Or maybe you just are n't ready to retire , want to continue working , and perhaps even transition into a brand new field . Consider the eight careers below if you 're looking to try something new . We 've included links to reputable resources that provide more information about each of these careers . <p> Getting paid to live in and maintain a large , beautiful house in a community separate from the more touristy areas of the country and having the opportunity to meet travelers from around the world sounds pretty cool . But of course , running a bed-and-breakfast is a lot of work , and sometimes your guests behave more like children than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for you online to help you with such a venture . Begin with the U.S. Small Business Administration website , a great site no matter what kind of small business you 'd like to start . Spend a little bit of time online , and you will find free resources and advice for aspiring bed-and-breakfast owners . <p> Those with a gift for creative and technical writing might consider a career as a grant proposal writer . A genuine passion for the mission of the organization you write for is crucial , as are up-to-date research skills and an eye for detail . Smaller-sized nonprofits and for-profits may only need a part-time writer who can work at home . Grant writing for larger organizations is a full-time position sometimes with a support staff . If you have solid writing skills , but are completely new to the world of fundraising , then seek out a mentor who can help you master the art of writing a grant . <p> Public relations and communications are actually two separate roles within a nonprofit organization . Two different people may head public relations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the responsibility of both roles . Nonprofits can benefit from the years of experience older workers bring to the table , especially those who have lived for some time in the community the nonprofit seeks to serve . The Public Relations Society of America offers plenty of free resources and breaking news about this field . <p> The term " green jobs " is defined broadly , but generally refers to work providing goods or services to create a sustainable environment , economy , and culture . It is a relatively new industry that benefits from the experience , knowledge , and drive of older workers and retirees . If you are an older worker , you can look into the Environmental Protection Agency 's Senior Environmental Employment program for green jobs . Or , you might consider starting your own business based on green initiatives . For example , Judi Henderson-Townsend created Mannequin Madness to recycle , rent , and sell discarded , non-biodegradable mannequins . <p> Older workers can be especially sensitive and responsive to the needs of the sick and elderly . After getting laid off from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the job of caring for her aging parents . Realizing she was good at caring for people in their homes , Albert took free , non-credit gerontology courses at a community college , and developed an overview of the field and opportunities that were available for small-business start ups . She now runs 24 Hour Angels , a care-giving company . <p> Sure , just start your own nonprofit ! Sounds easy , right ? Well , of course it is n't . But in spite of this , many seniors and retirees are bringing some good to the world , and creating a legacy for themselves , by founding nonprofits across the country that support everything from the arts to the humane treatment of animals to the advocacy of underprivileged children . Older workers are especially suited to starting a nonprofit thanks to years of personal investment in their communities , as well as an accumulation of life experience . Consider what needs are not being met in your community ; would people donate money and time to a nonprofit dedicated to addressing that need ? <p> Blogging may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ support yourself financially . There are ways to monetize a blog , but the truth is most bloggers make less than $100 a month from their sites . However , if you are looking for a creative outlet , and are interested in connecting to and interacting with a potentially limitless audience , consider starting a blog . If you know how to use keywords to drive traffic to your site , all the better . Check out ProBlogger.net for tons of information and resources for bloggers . There are plenty of subjects close to the hearts of older workers , seniors , and retirees that could be effectively addressed through a blog . You might consider blogging about your favorite historical figures , the nuances of a sport you love , or developments in business or politics . <p> Many golf courses staff their own pro golf instructors .

As both a businessperson and a consumer I have a unique perspective of the power it can have . It is a symbiotic relationship that at it 's best , pays dividends for consumers and businesses alike . But at it 's worst , it 's a self depreciating pit of despair where everyone loses . And at this day and age , with the way the internet has changed the speed at which information is shared , both its success and its failure can be greatly magnified . <p> But we 've all heard this tirade beforemany times . If you need to be told or reminded that customer service is important , you probably should reconsider why you 're doing business in the first place . So that is n't what I want to convey with this article . Instead , my goal is to bring attention to what having good customer service really means . And to do that , I 'm going to outline some areas that do n't usually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <h> Audit your entire business process <p> The ultimate goal of any businesses attention to customer service should be to need less of it . This does n't mean slashing your customer service budget . It means putting a focus on limiting customer complaints , questions , confusion , returns , and everything else that falls under the responsibility of the customer service department . It means constantly optimizing and simplifying your offering . Make the entire process of doing business with your company easier , simpler , faster , and problem free for your customers . <p> This means taking a full start-to-finish audit of the entire business process . It requires a good amount of communication and effort to sort out and find solutions for common issues and inefficiencies . But by going through the process , you will ideally find ways to improve your offering which will make your customers happier , your company more competitive , and ( in many cases ) reduce overall business costs . <h> Business infrastructure optimization <p> I really feel bad for customer service representatives who work for companies who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They probably spend a lot of their day being yelled at by angry customers for things they can do absolutely nothing about . These companies could have the best customer service department in the world and still lose . Competing companies who get it right , will always steal their business . <p> Here 's an example : <p> A few years ago , I bought tickets to a football game for my brothers and sisters . All total 7 of us were going to the game , but none of us had a car big enough . So we decided to split the cost of renting a van or SUV that could comfortably fit us all in one vehicle . It was my job to find the car . <p> Looking online , it was clear that our timing was awful . It seemed none of the local rental places had anything that would work . Everything was booked , so to the phones I went . The first company I called outsourced their customer service as the person I was talking to clearly did not speak English as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I we ca n't understand each other , and even though he was n't very friendly , all I cared about was the car . In a voice as cold as reading it on the internet , he told me what I already knew : that the local place was all booked up and the closest vehicle was at a location too far away to work . He wished me a nice day , and I hung up disappointed . Next two companies , same storyalmost like I was talking to the exact same representative . <p> Finally , I called Enterprise . This time , a woman with a strong southern accent picked up the line seemingly eager to help . After telling her what I was looking for , she informed me what I what I was only now calling to confirm : that the closest car was in another location that was too far away . However , instead of leaving it at that , she said they could have one of the SUV 's sent over for us that day ! What a marvelous thing ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ company that does this , or if the others were simply unable or unwilling . I 'm also not sure which is worse ? What I do know , is that Enterprise won my business that day , and now they 're the first I call every day after . Not because the other companies decided to cheap out and outsource their customer service to India or elsewhere . But because Enterprise was set up to be both able and willing to meet my needs . Going above and beyond is n't just up to your customer service department , it 's up to the entire business to cater to your customers needs , especially when those needs are challenging . <h> Outsourcing <p> Outsourcing customer service is a buyer beware situation . It usually costs less , but the service is also usually second rate . But once again , most of us already knew that .

If not , you 're going to be held responsible for the carelessness of another company . Never a good situation . <p> Here 's another story : <p> After multiple service problems and fee increases , I became fed up with my local cable company and decided to switch to Direct TV Satellite as our television provider . Getting set up was a snap , though I had to wait over a month before they could install the dish . ( It did n't seem odd at the time ) Everyone I spoke with was quick , friendly , and knowledgeable . I had all the confidence in the world about their customer service . Well worth the switch . <p> This past summer , I finished renovations on my basement/man cave . Having become addicted to the NFL package , I absolutely needed to add a new line in order to watch the games downstairs . So I called to make an appointment to have it installed sometime in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earliest it could be done was August 23rd , nearly 6 weeks from that day . Not happy about it , I set the appointment . <p> When the day came , I took work off so I could be home " between 12 and 5 " . At about 4:45 , I received a phone call telling me that they were n't going to be able to make it . The technicians were too far behind and we 'd have to reschedule . Even though I was a bit upset that I took the day off , I understood how these things can happen . <p> " Unfortunately , it will be another 6 weeks before the next available appointment " , she then told me . <p> " WRONG . " I said . " I did n't cancel on you , so please do n't punish me by putting me back to the end of the line . " <p> " I 'm sorry sir , there 's nothing I can do . " , she offered . <p> " Yes there is . Cancel someone for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , clearly annoyed at this point . " I made my appointment before any of them did , so do n't you think I should be next ? " <p> " Hold on , let me see what I can figure out . " she put me on hold . A few minutes later , " Sir ? I can fit you in for September 6th . I do apologize that 's the very best I can do . " <p> " Well , you could waive the installation fee . That will be two days of work I have to miss for this . " , I suggested . <p> " I 'm sorry sir , we are a subcontractor for Direct TV , they outsource their installations to us , you will have to take that up with them . " I booked the appointment for 2 days before NFL kickoff and urged her to make note that I had already been bumped once . <p> When I hung up , I immediately called Direct TV 's customer service department to share my issue with them . After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even offered to waive one month of the basic package ( more than the installation fee , but less than I lost missing work for a day ) . <p> When the installer came to my house , he was friendly and quick . But when I asked him to put the cable above my new drop-ceiling , he informed me that it would cost another $50 " for putting the cord inside of walls or fixtures " . I showed him how little was involved , but he seemed to care even less . So rather than pay $50 , I spent the 2 minutes doing it myself . Easiest $50 I 've ever saved . <p> Now even though Direct TV went out of their way to make me happy , I still have a bad taste in my mouth from the whole experience . I 'm still a Direct TV customer , but now I worry about the next time I have to deal with one of their " sub contractors " . If my dish gets damaged or otherwise goes offline , equipment fails , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And if another network offers me an alternative ( especially if they include an equivalent NFL package ) , after this experience , I 'm now much more willing to consider it .

Sure , there are times when your supervisor is having a bad day and projects a bit on others in the office , but if the icy disposition continues , there is something unquestionably wrong with your performance in the company .

@@9125003 @2325003/ <h> General Liability Insurance for Small Business @qwx124540 <p> Written By : Carol Wilson <p> No small business owner should go a single day without general liability insurance coverage . By doing so , they expose their entire operation to lawsuits that can arise from negligence on the part of their company or any employee . In this litigious day and age , a small business owner can do everything right and still find themselves involved in an expensive lawsuit . With the right general liability insurance policy , assets are protected from litigation that results from either personal injury or property damage . <p> Liability Limits While general liability insurance can be bundled into a complete business owners insurance policy along with property insurance for a reduced rate , the limits are typically lower than most small business owners find comfortable . By purchasing a separate liability policy , the small business owner can customize their coverage to include higher liability limits . To determine the appropriate coverage levels for a specific small business , two factors should be considered . First , consider the perceived risk of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hazardous chemicals would generally have a higher risk of personal injury or property damage than one that makes cotton balls . Second , determine if the small business operates in a state that has a history of handing out large settlements to plaintiffs in civil lawsuits . If so , the liability limits should be set accordingly . <p> General Liability Basics While the litigation process can be very complicated , the way that general liability insurance protects the small business owner is fairly simple . The policy owner is protected from legal expenses for claims and lawsuits resulting from covered actions such as property damage , bodily injury , personal injury , and advertising injury . Advertising injury includes any damages that result from slander or false advertisements on the part of the covered small business . Many claims are settled outside of the courtroom . However , the insurance company covers all damages and legal fees if the case is tried in a court of law . The only penalties that wont be covered are punitive damages because they are considered punishment for purposely causing harm to another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ specifies the limits of coverage . The policy will list a maximum amount that can be paid during the coverage period and the maximum coverage per claim . Anything above these limits is the financial responsibility of the small business owner . For example , a business purchases a general liability policy that covers their operation for a year with a $2 million yearly limit and a $1 million per claim limit . During the second month of the policy , a customer sues them for a personal injury claim and is awarded $200,000 . Three months later , a negligent worker causes a fire that destroys a commercial property worth $1.5 million . The general liability insurer covers the first claim completely , and the business owner owes nothing out of pocket . For the second claim , the insurer pays the claimant $1 million , and the company is responsible for the other $500,000 . This example illustrates the fact that both the yearly cap and the per incident cap must be carefully evaluated before choosing a coverage level . 
@@9125004 @2325004/ <h> Why HBO does n't  want you as their customer @qwx124540 <p> Cord cutters , you 're called . People who have decided having both internet service and cable service is redundant . The next generation who prefers to get their entertainment at will and on demand , on any device at any time . With services like Hulu and Netfllix , you know what 's possible , and you 'll have it no other way . And despite having an online delivery service of their own called HBO GO , HBO does n't  want you as their customer . <p> But the truth is : they 're terrified of you . And now with the massive popularity of the series Game of Thrones , and the consequential record piracy projections , the issue has gone mainstream . People are wise to the lack of choice as a consumer , and theyve shown that they wont be bullied into buying cable just to watch a single show . And HBO seems content to leave these potential customers on the market knowing full well the consequences of doing so . But now these forsaken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money : <p> The reason for HBOs stubbornness is quite simple : While serving its content directly to online consumers instead of being exclusively tied to cable service might be good for HBO , it would likely be at an overall loss for the parent company : Time Warner . <p> HBO is owned by and represents around 25% of Time Warners total value . And even though its a relatively lone bright spot in an otherwise ( generally ) struggling company , a majority of the revenue still comes from the cable and broadband internet supplier : Time Warner Cable . If HBO were to offer their content independent of cable , they believe it would actually encourage cable cutting . Suddenly , demand for cable service ( their bread and butter ) would be made that much weaker . <p> But that 's not all it would do . <p> If HBO makes it easier for people to get rid of cable , It would also weaken other cable content networks as overall cable subscribers drop . Having cable service as a prerequisite for HBO benefits the other channels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know ( or have guessed by now ) Time Warner owns a number of these properties as well : Turner Broadcasting ( TNT , TBS , TCM , CNN , Cartoon Network , TruTV , etc. ) and Warner Brothers ( WB , CW , etc. ) to name the bigger ones . <p> This is also why Time Warner sees services like HULU and Netflix as more direct competition than services like Comcast or Direct TV . Growth of the former only serves to weaken the demand for expensive cable packages ( that usually include a large number of unnecessary channels you might not have any interest in at allbut you pay for ) ; the latter still strengthen it even though they compete directly for the same customers as service providers . And that means more lucrative licensing contracts as well as ratings and advertising revenue for a majority of their cable networks . <h> Why Game of Thrones may not be a good litmus test <p> The popularity of the show Game of Thrones is not to be underestimated . Its one of the hottest shows on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ratings making it #1 for the highly contested Sunday 9:00 P.M. EST time slot . Add that to the fact that its is the most illegally downloaded show in history , and you have a show that has quite a sizeable audience . <p> Lately , there 's been a lot of those who will look at the piracy numbers and point fingers at HBO for having a lack of foresight . But honestly , if you did n't  see it coming , you do n't  deserve to work in TV , let alone for HBO . <p> Game of Thrones is an adaptation of the fantasy book series A Song of Ice and Fire . Its a show that caters to a built in audience that islets call them : tech savvy . They also probably are n't  ( generally ) quite as interested in sports and likely do n't  watch all that much Television regularly . In other words , ironically , HBOs most popular show caters to an audience of classic cord cutters . More than most shows do , anyways . <p> HBO knows this . That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the media hype around the piracy figures . They do n't  see it as a fair representation of the potential market for selling content to cord cutters . In other words , this is as good as it gets . And it is n't enough for them to risk Time Warners core business model . Meanwhile , the show still does very well regardless . <p> Side note : I am a huge fan of the book series and purchased HBO only for the 10 weeks the season is on just so I could support the show and it would continue to get funding . I feared piracy might hurt ratings to the point that the show would be canceled . Glad I was wrongso far . <h> Somethings got ta give <p> When HBO executives asserts that cord cutting is a fad or a temporary trend brought on by a struggling economy , they are n't  being genuine . Its a growing reality that HBO/Time Warner will likely have to face sooner or later . Their outdated business model is fading and continues to be weakened by every new internet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cant blame them for not wanting to contribute to their own demise .

@@9125006 @2325006/ <h> Mega Conspiracy the ugly truth about Megaupload @qwx124540 <p> Not 24 hours after the blackouts protesting SOPA and PIPA , the Federal Government shut down the popular website MegaUpload.com which represented an estimated 4% of all internet traffic . Kim Dotcom , the Hong Kong based company 's founder and 6 others were also arrested yesterday and listed in an indictment by a U.S. Federal Grand Jury . Conspiracy to commit copyright infringement , racketeering , and money laundering are among the charges . It 's a story that 's been months in the making , and the timing of which makes the title " Mega Conspiracy " all the more appropriate . Here are the facts : <h> A bit of background &amp; recent history <p> MegaUpload.com acts as a service that 's known as a " cyberlocker " a place for users to upload large files so they can be shared and/or downloaded elsewhere . The purpose of this service is meant for users who have a need to transfer files normally too large for email or other online medium . What makes MegaUpload unique , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ video and audio files allowing third party sites ( called " linking sites " ) to stream the files for users without the need to first download the full file . <h> The current charges <p> The federal investigation of MegaUpload and affiliates ( according to the indictment ) goes back as far as May of 2010 . On January 5th , the indictment of charges were filed and sealed until yesterday , January 19th , when the charges were served . In all , 7 people and 2 corporations were listed among the defendants : <p> Kim Dotcom <p> Finn Batato <p> Julius Bencko <p> Sven Echternach <p> Mathias Ortmann <p> Andrus Nomm <p> Bram Van Der Klok <p> Megaupload Limited <p> Vestor Limited <p> 4 of those listed in the indictment were arrested on Thursday in Auckland , New Zealand by officials working with the U.S. department of justice . <p> The 5 charges include : <p> Conspiracy to commit racketeering <p> Conspiracy to commit copyright infringement <p> Conspiracy to commit money laundering <p> Criminal copyright infringement by distributing a copyrighted work being prepared for commercial distribution on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ infringement <p> Additionally , megaupload.com and a number of affiliated web properties were siezed and shut down by authorities on the same day . The files were filed in the jurisdiction of the Eastern District of Virginia federal court because many of the infringing files were hosted on servers located there . <h> How the " Mega Conspiracy " works <p> If you want a detailed account of the alleged charges against megaupload and affiliates , read the 72 page indictment document here . The document outlines how the mega conspiracy works , here 's a simplified version : <p> MegaUpload.com users can upload any electronic document to the service and share it at their discretion for free . Files from unpaid users are online temporarily unless they are downloaded within a specific grace period , otherwise they are automatically deleted . Downloading files is also free , though you must wait 30 seconds ( on a page with advertising ) before the download link becomes active . Video streaming is limited to 72 minutes for non paid members as well . Premium ( paid ) members have no limits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to 72 minutes on streaming videos . <p> Here 's where the " racketeering " part starts Premium members are then offered a cash rewards program for popular downloads to provide incentives for the members to upload popular content ( particularly copyright infringing content ) . These members also , then , have an incentive to promote the content through 3rd party services , known as " linking sites " . MegaUpload benefits from monetizing both additional paid subscribers and advertising revenue while the premium user benefits from the cash reward . Users who uploaded copyrighted material were ( according to the agreement ) subject to disqualifications , but in an email quoted by the indictment , they chose to be " flexible " enforcing them on these grounds as they had " saved quite a lot on fraud already " . <p> The indictment also alleges that the defendants were deliberately conservative about following DMCA take-down notices in favor of the revenue obtained from such violations . In one email correspondence , Dotcom wrote : <p> " I remembered the steep drop of revenue at the same time in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by careless mass link deletions . This made me very mad , especially because I told you that such mass deletions should be prevented and sources checked much more carefully . I am sure such mass link deletions are also contributing to a drop of revenue In the future please do not delete thousands of links atones from a single source unless it comes from a major organization in the US . " <p> Users known to have uploaded illegally obtained copyrighted material not only continued to be able to do so , but were continually rewarded for it . <h> Where it gets even stranger <p> The timing of the serving of the indictment reeks of cac . The clear power of groups like the MPAA and others lobbying our government to take a hard stance on IP theft is difficult to ignore . The length of the investigation along with the apparent timing of both the filing and serving of the indictment with the apparent defeat of SOPA and PIPA can hardly be written off as coincidence . This move is a clear power flex by copyright protectors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The take-down of the entire megaupload.com website is also a cause of outrage as many users ( both legitimate and not ) are arguing that such a preliminary injuction is akin to a " guilty until proven innocent " mentality . But perhaps more concerning about this part of the indictment is the previous attempts by copyright holders to censor megaupload . <p> Finally , the cooperation by officials in New Zealand on the arrest of four of the defendants has also raised a few eyebrows . Even more interesting : today , details about the arrest of the site 's founder Kim Dotcom have come to light in what seems to have been a partial stand-off and potentially violent incident ending in the defendant arrested next to a " sawed-off shotgun " in his " panic room " . <p> This story certainly is n't over . It 's likely that MegaUpload is going to fight each and every one of the charges . But while their business model is certainly set up for copyright infringement abuse , that in and of itself is n't what makes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to cooperate with copyright owners to remove and/or discourage such activity in favor of their own financial gain . The correspondence between two of the defendants ( found in the indictment ) sums it up best :

Tarmac delays lasting hours upon hours have become increasingly more common , and passengers are fed up with the lengthy delays and utter negligence . Even with the Department of Transportation 's new rule that forbids aircrafts from idling on the tarmac for more than three hours , tarmac delays and airline drama are still a nagging problem for domestic and international airline carriers . Out of all the disastrous flights in history , these 10 airport tarmac nightmares truly changed the way we fly . <p> The most recent tarmac nightmare happened on a JetBlue flight that left passengers parked on the tarmac without food , water , or working bathrooms for seven miserable hours . The New Jersey-bound jet was diverted to the Hartford , Conn. , airport because of a rare October blizzard . Before landing at Bradley Airport , the pilot scared passengers when he announced that the plane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an hour away . He quickly reassured them that they had enough fuel to make it to Hartford . Little did any of the trapped fliers know that it would be another seven to 14 hours before they 'd make it off the plane . <p> What was supposed to be a routine , three-hour flight from Houston to Minneapolis turned into a disastrous six-hour delay on the tarmac . The Continental Airlines Flight 2816 was diverted to Rochester , Minn. , because of thunderstorms , but it ended up staying on the tarmac for an agonizing six hours and another three-and-a-half in the terminal . The nauseating smells of the toilet and crying babies drove passengers crazy . To add to the misery , passengers were limited to pretzels and one free beverage during the agonizing delay . <p> Passengers were entertained and a little perturbed by JetBlue flight attendant Steven Slater , who went bonkers after a passenger cursed at him . Slater asked the passenger not to remove his luggage until the plane had come to a complete stop and the passenger told Slater to " f @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the airline 's PA system and dramatically grabbed his two bags , a can of beer , and pulled the lever that releases the inflatable chute to slide down to the tarmac .

The Al-Qaeda operative was armed with explosives in his shoes and tried to light a fuse in his shoe but was subdued by several passengers . The plane was destined for Miami , but made an emergency landing in Boston , where Reid was arrested on the ground and passengers were transported to the main terminal . This frightening experience changed U.S. airports security by making shoe removal and scans a standard security procedure . <p> In 2006 , British charter airline , Thomsonfly , stalled a flight and stranded 178 passengers on the tarmac because the pilot lost his cell phone in the cockpit .

All of the plane 's passengers were interviewed by TSA and FBI officials and were put through a screening and had their luggage re-examined . Following the incident , President Barack Obama ordered increased security for air travel . <p> Passengers and crew members of Flight 1248 from Baltimore to Chicago experienced the landing from hell . On Dec. 8 , 2005 , the Boeing 737-700 skidded off the runway and plowed into a busy intersection , colliding with vehicles .

The biggest perk of all is simply having the ability to see what people are saying about a company without having to actively survey them . <h> Potential Drawbacks <p> There really are n't many drawbacks involved in being active on Twitter . A company should take care to give control of its Twitter account to someone who is skilled in public relations and in social media . In the wrong hands , a Twitter account can create problems . Another potential drawback is simply being unaware of the benefits of Twitter or being unable to make the most of the service . Many companies give up before they give the site a reasonable shot . <h> Generating Traffic through Twitter <p> Many businesses use Twitter to post links to various pages on their websites . This social media platform is perfect for that kind of thing . Incoming links can bolster a site 's ranking with the major search engines , so it 's especially advantageous to post links on Twitter .

Here are ten of the best ones : <p> Include a live stream of your company 's Twitter feed on its main site . The National Archives does it in a way that enhances its site and makes it more interactive . <p> Keep your finger on the pulse of public sentiment . You can set up saved searches or RSS feeds that alert you to comments about your company and its products or services . <p> Use Twitter to connect with other people within your industry . When used properly , it can be a very effective networking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other events by tweeting about them .

Customers are generally impressed with companies take the time to listen to them on Twitter . <p> Do n't strictly post links to your own website .

DIRECTV , for example , uses the social media site to keep followers informed about new features and programming options . Wachovia , which is considered to be a rather stodgy company , routinely surprises people by responding to complaints through the site . JetBlue has been using Twitter effectively for some time and uses the site to listen to what its customers have to say . <h> Will it Last ? <p> As with anything on the Internet , there 's no way to know for sure whether Twitter will last .

Amidst the chaos and terror of a riot , mobs of angry people see fit to smash windows and doors of stores and walk away with anything they can get their hands on . It is an especially effective time for theft , given that police can only control so many people at any given time . Throughout history , riots have been ignited for various reasons . Popular sources include racial confrontations , police brutality , and economic tensions . When a large group of people feel that their demands for justice are n't being met , they can get truly riled up . The ensuing damage can cost billions . <p> The London riots are fresh on our minds , as they occurred less than a year ago , starting on August 6 , 2011 . The riots sparked from an initially peaceful protest over the fatal shooting of Mark Duggan by the police force during an arrest attempt . People @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be unarmed at the time of the shooting and his family was not immediately informed of his death . There were also racial tensions to blame , as well as police brutality . From that point onward , the peaceful protest became violent , with theft , fires , stolen vehicles , and the like . Looters were partial to posting their finds on social networking sites , which resulted in a blackberry messenger hack such that Londoners could be informed of where the next looting would take place so they could collectively participate . The riots were mainly in the Tottenham section of North London . <p> The Los Angeles riots broke out on April 29 , 1992 when the verdict to the 1991 Rodney King case was announced on live television . The case concerned Rodney King , an African American , who had been brutally caned by four LAPD officers . When the verdict cleared all but one of the officers from all charges , the public was outraged , and broke into riots , which continued for four days . Curfews were enacted and schools and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thousand National Guard were called in to restore peace , while the city suffered fires , looting , and general violence towards all kinds of people . More than 50 people were killed and damages within the city were estimated at $1 billion . <p> On July 13 , 1977 , a massive blackout blanketed the entirety of New York City and lasted for just more than 24 hours . During that time , thousands of fires were set ablaze , stores were looted , and people were arrested for rioting and other disturbances . The rioting caused damages in excess of $300 million . It was reported that lightening caused the blackout . New Yorkers were experiencing a low point in morale due to an economic crisis , which may have spurred on the riotous behavior . Chaos ensued as thousands of New Yorkers took advantage of the absence of power to pillage food , appliances , and other goods . <p> When police raided an after-hours drinking club expecting to turn in a few patrons , they were met with 82 people throwing a party celebrating the return @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrest everyone inside anyway , which caused an angry crowd to gather outside the establishment in protest . As the final police cars exited the scene , the gathered protestors began to break windows of nearby businesses to loot the area . They also started fires and other forms of vandalism . The five subsequent days of rioting escalated to a point in which the National Guard had to be called , 43 people were killed , and more than 7,000 were arrested . The rioting started in the Northwest side of Detroit but spread all the way to the East side . The riots started in a predominantly black neighborhood and , on the whole , can be attributed to racial and socioeconomic factors . <p> After Martin Luther King , Jr . ' s assassination on April 4 , 1968 , riots broke out all over the country . However , the worst of the rioting was in Chicago , with a series of riots known as the Chicago Riots of 1968 . These started in the black ghetto and spread . Fires were set and looting occurred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curfew and closed down the streets to vehicle traffic .

Not only were people killed and rendered homeless , but the looting in the black neighborhoods caused a food shortage that had to be addressed by volunteer aid . <p> During the afternoon of April 12 , police in Brixton came upon a young black man with what appeared to be a stab wound on his back . In their effort to escort him to the hospital , civilians began to violently confront the police officers . The officers were able to get the stabbed black youth onto an ambulance and break up the fighting , but doubled their squad cars in the area and patrolled it heavily until the following day .

Riots and other acts of violence had been enacted in the streets in the weeks prior , and the police were sent to a construction site to investigate a potential break-in .

So during this joyful and hectic time of year , particularly for retail store owners , there are a number of things businesses should do in preparation for the rush : <p> Increase staff There 's few things more frustrating than shopping at a store that has painfully long lines next to unmanned registers ( I 'm looking at you wal*mart ) . I personally avoid stores that skimp on this essential improvement like the plague . I 'd rather shop somewhere that cares enough about my time to spend the extra few bucks to make me feel appreciated ( even if it costs me a bit more ) . Beyond cashiers , however , businesses need to understand that all customer service needs will increase during the holidays and skimping on it is unwise at the very least . <p> Improve Security With bigger crowds comes greater opportunity for theft and other forms of fraud . Beefing up security measures can ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Failing to do so , then , will result in diminished returns to the bottom line . This piece of advice comes with a bit of caution , however : Do n't make it too inconvenient for your customers .

If you can improve security without direct customer interaction , look that way first . And if you ca n't limit the interaction as much as possible . <p> Restock Inventory As a shopper , being forced to go to another store because you " ran out " , is a frustrating experience to say the least . And while there are always a few hot items each year that are tough to find anywhere , it 's by and large an avoidable scenario . In the weeks leading up to Black Friday , store owners should pay careful attention to trending items , especially those that are being released just in time for the holiday season .

It happens nearly every year , people are trampled , knocked over , and squished in large part due to the lack of preparation by the store for the enormous turnout on Black Friday . And yes , shoppers are also partly to blame , but situations like these are almost always avoidable when the proper care is taken . Also , for stores and other brick and mortar businesses in the northern states , it 's almost December . Winter is nearly here and that means snow , sleet , freezing rain , ice , icicles , and a number of other accidents waiting to happen .

But even if you choose not to participate in the madness that is Black Friday , remember , the shopping " holiday " is just a marketing ploy to get customers into their store . Offering strategically limited items for unusually low prices is the draw for customers who usually do n't leave without making additional purchases as well . And it 's that " draw " that all businesses should be after , whether it 's exclusively on the morning of Black Friday or not .

I do not advocate this activity in any way , and if a bill were introduced that could stop piracy without serious negative consequences , I would be all for it . <p> That said , neither the SOPA or the Protect IP are such bills . My issues with them are clear : they do more harm than good , and the following is who they hurt the most : <h> Free Speech/Open Communication <p> Your freedom of speech does not include the right to use copyrighted materials ( unless it 's protected under " fair use " , etc . ) . So when organizations or individuals spread copyrighted materials they are essentially breaking the law . Copyright owners have a right to go after damages as well as get a permanent injunction against the offending publication , etc. to have the violation(s) removed as per the DMCA . So why do we need further laws @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quick enough . The solution : something called a preliminary injunction . It 's essentially a court order to block/remove potentially copyrighted materials before the accused has the chance to fully and properly defend themselves . But that 's not all . The proposed acts do n't just reserve the right to a preliminary injunction for specific offenses . Instead , an entire website can be blocked and completely shut down from operating including blocking financial income streams if the site is deemed to be " dedicated to infringement " . <p> This portion of these laws essentially gives copyright owners too much power . Power to censor and block entire services for the actions of a few users without so much as a chance to defend themselves . The potential for this power to be used as a means for censorship and infringement of freedom of speech is very real . But even if you argue that such a scenario is n't too terribly likely , the very possibility of it points out the dire flaw in the laws ' language that needs to be rethought completely . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ online services that are used for open communication more strictly govern their user 's activity . A scenario which may include removal or editing of user activity deemed to be potential copyright infringement ( even if it is n't ) just for the sake of minimizing potential liability . <h> Business <p> Internet giants such as Google , Facebook , and Twitter have come out against the SOPA and Protect IP acts because they represent a very real danger a major component of the success of their business models : that of free and open communication . They not only put this ideal in jeopardy , but place an unrealistic liability on companies who are trying to protect this right . Conversely , these bills argue that companies like Google and Facebook are making profit off of infringing activities and should therefore be held liable . <p> But while both sides might have a point , none of the proposed solutions actually solves the problem . Instead they simply give additional legal authority by copyright holders to place blame and seek damages for activities ( such as linking to an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difficult to govern . Assuming that services like Google or Facebook could successfully govern all such activities , it could , as a result , cause users to find other services that can'tor wo n't . <p> Big companies are n't the only ones who are at risk here , either . These new laws could even effect smaller businesses who simply do n't have the resources to fight accusations from litigious individuals or organizations that now have a broader legal definition of what constitutes copyright liability . <p> In essence , what 's happening here is the movie and music industry have found that their previous attempts to fight online piracy have failed . So now their solution is to ask the U.S. government make it everyone else 's responsibility to help with the fight or become potentially legally responsible for violations that may only remotely include their service . <p> Considering that web innovations are a rare bright spot in a struggling U.S. economy , a bill that threatens their continued advancements could n't possibly come at a worse time . This could be the most realistic and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truly cares at all about the economy , such laws would n't even come up for a vote . <h> Users of The WWW <p> As I mentioned earlier , the DMCA was supposed to be a solution to copyright infringement online .

Pirating domains have been driven to " safe havens " that these bills will be able to attack from a variety of angles . Anything from forcing your ISP to block the entire site to going after income streams that the service relies upon to stay alive . <p> What 's troubling , however , is that these bills give copyright owners the same power for domestic and DMCA compliant services as well . The result could lead to censorship , invasion of privacy , reservations about the spreading of ideas , and a general distrust of all the services we rely upon for the future of communication . The greater impact of which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ source of our global social evolution . Perhaps that last part seems a bit much ? I 'm not the only one who feels this way : <h> Consumers <p> I do n't usually presume to know what an industry should do , but it seems to me one of the biggest losers in this fight against copyright infringement the world wide web , is the actual consumers of music , movies , and television . As a self-proclaimed movie buff , I 've been waiting for the industry to embrace web technologies to provide me with content in a quicker and less expensive manner . You see , I 'm among the first generation obsessed with the instant gratification the internet provides . We know what 's possible , so as a result , my ( and future ) generations grow more impatient with industries who refuse to adapt . <p> The music industry should be a model example of what 's possible . Having done the best to embrace the technology , services like Spotify not only take advantage of our demand for instant gratification , but also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They also provide an essential set of income streams from the very technology these industries are fighting against . AND YET the most interesting part is : services like these actually decreases pirating ! <p> So as an avid consumer of music and movies ( especially ) I ca n't help but feel that these attempts are a clear disregard of consumer demand by industries who are too concerned with protecting outdated business models . This is my message : Adapt or disappearfuture generations wo n't be sympathetic to your lame appeals to protect your right to price gouge us ESPECIALLY at the potential expense of our first amendment rights . Thank you . <h> Piracy <p> At first I did n't include pirates on my list , but then I realized I had to if only to point out the fact that of all the damage these bills could do , copyright pirates are hurt the least . From the very first page of the Protect IP act where it began defining " domains " and " sub-domains " I knew it could n't to much to stop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ internet protocol . Technology already exists beyond the WWW to use the internet to transfer files . And because these laws single out a specific protocol , they wo n't succeed in stopping piracy . As a result , even if you do n't agree with any of the other reasons listed in this article , the failure of these acts to actually do what they are intended for ( on a larger scale ) means they should n't be taken seriouslyby anyone .

Although estimates vary , most experts believe that the five-year failure rate for small businesses is at least 50 percent . This disheartening number can be even higher in times of poor economic growth , which makes the job of an entrepreneur very difficult in today 's environment . Only by providing a product or service that is in high demand by consumers will you be able to achieve success with your small business . In order to do this , you must be able to solve a serious problem from which customers are suffering . When customers are burdened by challenges , they become more willing to give their money to anyone who can make their lives easier . <p> Unfortunately , this is not an easy task . Many entrepreneurs fail to accurately assess the market and proceed to create a business that fails to meet any need at all . Even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do such assessments ; instead , they embrace an idea because of their personal affinity for it . <p> Entrepreneurs are often told to " follow their dreams " and to " pursue their passion . " Of course , considering the amount of time that you will invest in a new business endeavor , it is important to do something that you enjoy . People who do not like their work are less likely to produce a quality product or service , and they are more likely to quit when times get tough . At such moments , people who love what they do are more willing to stick with it because of the inherent joy that they get from the activity . <p> However , it is important to realize that passion is not enough ; you also have to produce something for which people are willing to pay . All the passion in the world will do you little good if it is not directed toward the solution of a problem . Sadly , customers have little interest in your talents and goals ; they simply want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needs to conduct detailed market research before investing a significant amount of time and money in a business . With every idea that you have , you need to consider its potential market . Who is going to buy this product or service ? How much will they pay for it ? How much is it going to cost in order to provide it ? If you do n't have the answers to these questions before you open your business , you probably wo n't have a business for very long . <p> Given the vastness of the Internet , it has become easier than ever to find the answers to such questions . Market research firms and government agencies have reams of data and statistics that can be used to calculate the size of the market for your product . <p> You can also use the Internet to gather information on competitors . In all likelihood , there is already another company that is attempting to solve the problem that you want to fix .

Even in industries that seem very mature , small businesses with unique ideas can disrupt everything . It is rare to find an industry that is operating at peak efficiency ; in addition , the most successful companies in an industry have little incentive to change their methods of doing business . <p> Google used this to its advantage when setting up its fledgling search engine in 1998 . In the early days of the Internet , the search engine business was dominated by players such as Yahoo ! , Excite and Lycos . Whereas these competitors had already established themselves in the market and were backed by powerful venture capital firms , Google was a simple research project run by Sergey Brin and Larry Page , two graduate students at Stanford University . <p> At the time , search engines were considered to be an unexciting and unprofitable business . All of the major Internet companies were focused on becoming " portals , " central destinations for everything a customer would want , including news , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were undesirable because they sent users away from the portal . <p> Therefore , little research was done on search engine technology ; indeed , most companies thought that the technology was already perfected . However , Brin and Page developed an algorithm that produced far superior results than anything that had come before it . They had a great idea , and they developed it into Google . <p> As it turned out , customers loved it . Other companies thought that customers were looking for the digital equivalent of a newspaper , but they were solving the wrong problem . Internet users were looking for an easy way to find information , and they were willing to go anywhere in order to find it . All that they needed was a guide to take them there . <p> When thinking about customers , you should n't define their problems too narrowly . Lycos and Excite thought that the problem was the lack of a quality Internet portal , but the true problem was the inability to find information . The portals were ultimately doomed by their narrow vision @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Google was quickly making their entire business model obsolete . <p> It is a simple lesson , but business owners constantly fail to appreciate it .

However , Ford realized that people did not really want a faster horse and buggy ; they simply wanted a fast way to get from one place to another . The horse was irrelevant , and that is why Ford was able to build an automotive empire . <p> You should always listen to your customers , but you must also realize that they may not always understand the best solutions to their problems .

Doctor fees without a negotiated health insurance rate can sometimes cost uninsured patients twice as much as they cost for insured patients . <h> Ongoing Care <p> If you do not have health insurance , then your primary choice for medical care may be the hospital emergency room . Many physicians will not see patients who do not have health insurance , and the doctors that do take uninsured patients normally require payment in advance or immediately after care is rendered . <p> Without health insurance , your ability to see a doctor on a regular basis is in jeopardy .

But as those younger people age , it can be more difficult for them to get good health insurance . <p> If you do not carry health insurance for long periods of time , you can start to develop conditions that may prevent you from qualifying for health insurance coverage when you need it .

Health insurance covers pre-natal visits for expecting mothers , regular pediatric appoints for young children , assistance in stopping a chemical dependency and help in dealing with stress and other psychological issues . <p> When you do not have health insurance , your ability to deal with life changes is severely limited .

Once you have the names of several different companies , spend some quality time with Google and figure out whether there are folks out there praising or complaining about the company you 're considering . While individual consumer reviews should never hold the weight of objective studies , they can help identify specific trends taking place at individual insurance companies .

How long do you plan to reside in the state where you 're purchasing your auto insurance ? What is the minimum coverage term you can purchase ? Who will be driving your car ? Are there children who you might wish to add to your policy down the road ? Having some idea of your requirements for auto insurance over several years can put you in a stronger position when it comes time to make an agreement with your auto insurance company . <p> For those who already own a home or have other types of life or health insurance , it is worth looking into whether your insurance company offers a package deal for multiple types of insurance ; if so , this can give you another option with a company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insurance is a significant purchase , and drivers should take the time to explore their options and consider the benefits of different companies before making their selection .

Financial institutions that hold so much lending power that their failure could have a damaging ripple effect throughout the economy . It has been suggested that this ripple effect would be so detrimental that the government felt it would be better to bail them out than allow that to happen . <p> Today , with the economy still in a state of despair , citizens are ( again ) pointing their fingers at these institutions looking for ways to hold them accountable for the situation they are responsible for . And these same people have decided that waiting for the government to do something is not enough . Instead , consumers has become proactive and are literally doing everything in their power to send a message that greed at the cost of others must not go unpunished . <p> So what was once an excuse for government to protect their very existence , " too big " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <h> Occupy Wall Street &amp; the 99% <p> The first step along the path to accountability was a plea by the people to regain representation by their government , starting with a simple idea that the lower 99% of income earners are under-represented and the top 1% hold too much political power .

Critics quickly dismissed the movement as ' people looking for handouts ' in an attempt to undermine the message . <p> This trend then evolved into an all-out protest called ' Occupy Wall Street ' . The intent was to hold a protest on Wall Street carrying the message of the 99% and stay there until that message had been heard .

One such regulation is the lowered limit on interchange fees ( the fee charged to a merchant for a customer 's use of a debit card for a transaction ) . As a result , a number of large banks began to announce and implement debit card transaction fees for consumers .

While browsing the web without discretion , sending personal emails , and chatting on Facebook , you may not realize how dangerous it can be to stray from work-appropriate content .

The following list elaborates on the five worst possible things you can have on your company computer . <h> Job Listings <p> If your computer history indicates that you 've been looking for another job while at work , that 's a big no-no .

Restrict yourself to only the most basic things you need to accomplish the task required of you at work . Never install spyware either . If you truly need virus protection on your computer , the IT department will handle it . In many cases , spyware can do the opposite of what it implies , contaminating your computer with endless popup ads and allowing access to outsider sources , which is dangerous if your computer contains sensitive company information . <h> Passwords to Personal Accounts <p> While you should n't be logging into your bank account at work at all , never allow your work computer to store passwords to sites @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your off time , do not use your office computer to store any personal information that you might consider sensitive .

Unless I 'm missing something , all of the numbers referring to " workaholics " seem arbitrary
