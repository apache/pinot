
 n't even been sworn in yet for his second term , and there 's already a huge controversy brewing in Washington over Obama 's " white guy Cabinet , " referring to the recent spate of white males being appointed to top Cabinet positions . And while Obama 's overall appointment record gives him a slight advantage in diversity over his two predecessors , the optics at present admittedly do not look good when run through the media filter . But forget the optics , let 's take a moment and celebrate the first big , ridiculous , and ultimately pointless controversy of the new year and a new term . <p> Mediaite 's Tommy some of the flak the Obama administration has been taking for its picks yesterday , but with this story getting much more steam in the media , I have to ask why this has become the big controversy that it has been . Most people who voted for Obama , I would expect , care more about the qualifications of his political appointees than their race or gender . <p> Let 's look at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exception of Hillary Clinton , all of Obama 's " white guy " nominees thus far will be replacing other white guys . And , if you 'll recall , Obama 's first choice for his second-term Secretary of State was a black woman . Susan Rice could have been the third consecutive female Secretary of State , not to mention her appointment would have made three out of the last four State Department heads African-Americans . But if you 've been paying attention to the news at all since September , you 'll remember exactly why Rice 's appointment did n't exactly work out . <p> Another reason why this is particularly ridiculous is that on the whole , Obama 's Cabinet is actually fairly diverse . We have two Asian Cabinet members : Energy Secretary Steven Chu and Veterans Affairs Secretary Eric Shinseki . Attorney General Eric Holder , an African-American , is staying on for Obama 's second term . Also staying on are Kathleen Sebelius at Health and Human Services and Janet Napolitano at Homeland Security . Do these people not count ? And in spite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are not white men , does the fact alone that they are men make them not count ? <p> There is , of course , one more reason why this whole thing is completely ridiculous . Obama still has Commerce and Labor secretaries to appoint . Commerce has had an acting head since last year , and Labor Secretary Hilda Solis stepped down this week . Obama has n't announced their replacements yet , so maybe we all should reserve judgment on the makeup of Obama 's second-term Cabinet when it 's finalized . <p> John Nolte over at Breitbart sums up why this controversy is such a waste of time . <p> Through this growing , coordinated criticism , the media is deliberately pushing the idea that identity politics is a virtue above and beyond one 's qualifications . And that 's their only opposition to these nominees : gender and skin color ( remember when such a thing was called " discrimination ? " ) . <p> Nolte also makes the interesting point that of all the reasons anyone would be up in arms about any of Obama @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example ) , why is it the racial and sexual makeup of the Cabinet itself that has captured so much media attention ? <p> Diversity is obviously something a president should strive to maintain in government , and Jay Carney said Obama did " insist ... on diversity " in his lists for potential nominees , but the absolute top priority for any president is picking individuals who they believe to be supremely qualified for the job . Diversity of race and gender should certainly be factors for any president to consider , but ultimately , they are second to having diversity of thought . <h> How To Hand 
 are a dime-a-dozen now , but this one is pretty funny , especially if you are a music lover . <p> On last night 's edition of Wheel of Fortune , a contestant excitedly declared that she wanted to solve the " song/artist " puzzle and then proceeded to absolutely botch the title of what was arguably the late Johnny Cash 's most popular song , 1956 's " I Walk the Line . " <p> The only possible way this could have been remotely near-correct was if her entire knowledge of Cash 's famous song was based on some sort of booze-themed " Weird Al " Yankovic parody track . Not only was " I Walk the Line " Cash 's first number-one single , but it was also the title of a biographical film that sold a whole boatload of tickets and garnered a ton of awards . <p> So , uhh , pretty embarrassing . <p> ( To be fair , the next guy did n't fare much better , getting greedy by spinning again and losing the round on a " bankrupt " card. ) <h> Top 10 NFL 
 Jerry Springer appeared on HuffPost Live yesterday and admitted to viewers that he may have a small part in the dumbing down of society . Alright , not exactly . Springer actually admitted a much bigger role , saying , " I am the father of the destruction of Western civilization . " <p> Springer said that his show had " no redeeming social value " and called it " stupid . " When pressed , he said that while his show is " fun to do , " it really is " stupid . " <p> Springer went on to discuss other " reality " TV shows and said " what we call reality shows today are n't really reality . " <p> He also turned to more serious topics , and slammed American politicians for spending money on defense while simultaneously ignoring health care : <p> " We did n't hold hearings and say , ' how much is this going to cost ? ' We just went to war . But then you talk about something that 's real , the diseases that would affect us all , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have health insurance ?

 Golden Globe for " Best Lead Actress in a Comedy or Musical , " Saturday Night Live alumni Will Ferrell and Kristen Wiig hilariously feigned ignorance of the nominated films , ad libbing completely incorrect plot lines for each of the actresses involved . <p> Pretending as if they 've never presented awards before , and under the pretense that knowing the great performances of each nominee is essential to the gig , Ferrell and Wiig proceeded to make up stories to cover for their having " not seen " the movies . <p> The pair took Emily Blunt 's role in Salmon Fishing in the Yemen literally , praising her fishing skills , and her face , and Yemen , and stuff . <p> As for perennial nominee Judy Dench , " Where 'd she come from ? " the pair asked before explaining that she was " a police officer " in her " first-ever movie , " The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel . <p> Silver Linings Playbook star Jennifer Lawrence was praised for " the silver she collected " and the notebook she so vigorously guarded . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was fantastic in a movie about some mysterious " , " despite the fact that " no one knows what it is .

 biggest reactions to President Obama 's executive orders on gun violence from the right has been to call the twice-elected president a " tyrant " with designs to take guns away from law-abiding citizens . Jon Stewart tore into the hyped reactions , saying that tyrants do not go to their legislatures to pass laws , and people convinced that Obama is bringing tyranny to the United States look like assholes . <p> Stewart looked at the wall-to-wall Fox News coverage of Obama 's announcement , which ranged from calling it an " unprecedented assault " on the Second Amendment and saying that Obama has " ripped our Constitution to pieces . " Stewart wondered what possible " fascistic dictates ... King Obama " could have decreed . Well , Obama asked Congress to pass an assault weapons ban , leading Stewart to comment that " when tyrants want something done , they generally do n't ask their legislative bodies . " <p> Stewart also found it odd that Obama is suddenly Hitler merely for issuing two dozen executive orders . Stewart called out Fox News personalities Sean Hannity and Dana @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ W. Bush when he did the same . <p> Stewart admitted that Obama trotting out children at his announcement was " some manipulative political bullshit , " but argued that the right wing has been far more emotional in its arguments . He said told the pro-gun crowd is that if they fear tyranny and it does n't happen , " you just look like an asshole . " <p> Stewart dismissed arguments that German Jews with guns could have taken down Hitler or black people with guns would have meant slavery would n't have happened , wondering about the latter if black people would have only gotten three-fifths of a gun . <p> Stewart said that paranoid gun owners are just " confusing tyranny " with losing an election , pointing out that " tyrants do n't have to fight that fucking hard for Ohio " and do n't show up for debates . <h> Infographic : 64 
 on MSNBC 's Hardball about the dynamics that lead to a victory for President Barack Obama in the 2012 elections , former San Francisco Mayor Willie Brown said that he found the Democratic Party 's fortune in the last cycle not necessarily indicative of future success . Brown said that Democrats did not win races at the state-level in the numbers they should have and , in combination with Mitt Romney 's weak candidacy , the " cult of the personality " around Obama was more responsible for his victory than the Democratic Party 's appeal . <p> Michael Smerconish opened the segment by asking if the 2012 election results herald a more progressive future with an ascendant liberal collation . The Nation columnist John Nichols said that the coalition of voters the president assembled in 2012 was impressive and would be difficult to defeat . However , he cautioned that holding that coalition together without Obama on the ballot in 2016 would be a challenge . <p> Brown interjected , saying that the results in 2012 did not make him feel secure in the Democratic Party 's prospects for electoral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it would have been a more telling benefit for the party if it had been Nancy Pelosi reemerging as the Speaker of the House , and if Democratic governors had won in the numbers that they needed to win in , as well as legislative bodies being dominated by Democrats , " Brown replied . <p> " I think , the cult of the personality had a lot more to do with the end results this time around , in addition thereto , the defective candidacy of the Republican nominee , " Brown added . <p> Frustrated with how 
 a bright , straight line from the NRA 's clanging response to the horrific shootings at Sandy Hook Elementary School and their current slide in public opinion . This is n't just some generalized wave of anti-gun feeling ; six days after the shooting , and the day before Wayne LaPierre 's press conference , Public Policy Polling showed the organization with a positive favorability rating , 48 to 41 . A few weeks later , the same poll had them at favorable , vs. unfavorable , and more recently , an ABC News/Washington Post poll has them at just favorable , to unfavorable . <p> The mainstream media , and the NRA , would like you to believe that those numbers are somehow counteracted by a " surge " of 250,000 in memberships to the organization , a number for which they provide no verification . Even if they did , however , reporting on this surge gives the misleading impression that there 's some parity in Americans ' reactions to the NRA 's post-Newtown actions , or even that the NRA is gaining in support @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ polling numbers to the entire adult population , the NRA has lost the support of 28 million Americans since Wayne LaPierre began opening his mouth after the shootings , while the 250,000 members it claims to have gained represents one tenth of one percent of American adults . <p> According to Harkinson , though , there are compelling ( some more than others ) reasons to be skeptical of anything the NRA says about its membership numbers . He points to wild variances in published reporting of the group 's total membership , with gaps of up to two-and-a-half million in a matter of months : <p> Writing in 2000 , when the NRA claimed to have 3.6 million members , journalist Osha Gray Davidson speculated on some of the group 's strategies for fluffing itself up : <p> Two years ago , David Gross , then an NRA board member , confided to me that a substantial number of the group 's 1 million Life Members are , well , dead . " There just is n't that much incentive to go find out when someone passes away , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maintaining ( a dead member ) is minimal and when they add to your membership list . " <p> Who else is included in that figure of 3.6 million ? I may be although I have n't been a member for years . Not long ago , I received an NRA form letter stating that in recognition of my previous commitment to the Second Amendment , the gun group had granted me an honorary membership . The mailing even included an NRA membership card embossed with my name . <p> The NRA gives members a free subscription to one of four magazines : American Rifleman , American Hunter , America 's 1st Freedom , or NRA InSights . The first three magazines are audited by the Alliance for Audited Media , which as of July gave them a combined paid circulation ( including newsstand sales ) of 3.1 million . NRA InSights is an online-only magazine for kids , with a circulation of 25,000 . Though some NRA members may opt out of a free magazine , it 's likely that others pay to subscribe to more than one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can pick up the magazines on the newsstand , and the 3.1 million figure is almost certainly an upper-bound for the NRA 's true size . <p> If you are n't convinced , consider that , as of Spring , 2012 , the NRA itself could only boast an email list of two million members . Whether the other 2 million are dead , or freebies , or just Luddites , that self-admitted figure seriously undercuts the impression that people have of the NRA 's ability to reach people at a grassroots level . <p> The NRA has a vested interest in creating the impression that it speaks for 4.5 million Americans ( still just a tiny fraction of the population , much smaller than the 28 million who represent their drop in favorability ) , but mainstream media organizations should not . Creating the impression of balance between the NRA and everyone else makes the story more dramatic , and perhaps inoculates against shrieks of " bias , " but it does not serve the public interest . If they 're going to swallow what the NRA is spoon-feeding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other side , in the same breath . <h> UW Trustees Take 
 encourages citizens to document human rights abuses around the world is developing an app which will not only make it easier for them to do so , but may also save a lot of journalists a lot of headache . Witness , the group that describes part of their mission as using " video to open the eyes of the world to human rights violations , " is set to release " InformaCam , " the app which will allow users to verify the authenticity of video , photos or audio created from mobile devices . <p> Witness is joining with The Guardian Project to build the app . The groups are receiving in funding from Knight Foundation . Sam Gregory , program director for Witness , said , " InformaCam is our way to respond to this question of media authentication and model some solutions we hope people will adopt . " <p> Gregory spoke to Justin Ellis at Nieman Lab about how the app would work . InformaCam would create something like a technological watermark for video or photo content and pairs that with metadata like time and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grant will help us work out how InformaCam addresses the challenges of how do you gather as much contextualizing data about a photo or video , " he said . <p> The second challenge , according to Ellis , is how to create a system to show whether a video has been tampered with after being shot . Gregory noted that the software will not be a perfect solution to the problem of media authenticity , but will certainly help . <p> " It wo n't prove everything is true , " he said . " But , given the volume of media , you can make it easier for people to distinguish what is verifiable and help step up that ladder . " <p> Besides human rights and journalism uses , Gregory also said the app will be useful for things like documenting insurance claims and shooting natural disasters . <p> An alpha version of InformaCam is currently available for Android phones and Gregory said the pilot would launch in three to six months . <p> Interestingly , Witness also worked with The Guardian Project on something nearly the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ users to conceal identifies of photo subjects by pixelating faces and removing metadata. <h> A Strategic Analysis 
 thinking it , and I 'm going to say it : Ezra Klein is a know-it-all . The MSNBC contributor and overlord of The Washington Post 's Wonkblog is a , hip-to-be-square who hides his self-satisfaction beneath an air of competent " humility . " He never says it out loud , but you can just feel his judgment : I 'm smarter than you . <p> Well , let 's see how Perfesser Klein handles The Daily Caller 's Mickey Kaus , who set out to prove that the ? is an ? because of Electronic Medical Records ( EMR ) . <p> It 's true that Ezra Klein is on my " side , " and has never demonstrated anything but a straightforward command of policy , even when the news is n't particularly good , and considering the persecution I faced as the oldest rookie in the White House press , you would think I 'd resist the urge to bathe in " these damn kids " resentment , but when I saw Kaus ' piece , part of me was happy . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could find some of the posts that they 're being sued over , even though I knew they had all been deleted , when Betsy Rothstein popped up and promised that Kaus had not just taken Ezra Klein down , but had delivered an intellectual beatdown that she likened to " Mike Tyson up a little kid . " <p> Klein has been in the forefront of parroting the Democrat 's line that digitizing records would be a goldmine of savings to taxpayers , only they have n't been . In a post today , Kaus deconstructs Klein 's history , concluding , " Hoaxer , , or just confused ? When they are through with Manti Te'o maybe the nation 's amateur detectives can turn to Klein . " <p> The piece points out of how the wunderkind might not be all that . And , just as brutal , puts yet another nail in a coffin that would have had a watertight seal by now were it containing anyone other than the lead boy-bander . <p> It seemed like a bit of a stretch that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a nail into Ezra Klein 's career coffin , but maybe Kaus could at least take him down a peg . Carpentry ! <p> Kaus laid out the case against Klein in his opening paragraph : <p> The Education of Ezra Klein ( and Barack Obama ) continues : In 2007 , Young Ezra Klein was full of enthusiasm about the cost-saving potential of electronic record keeping in the health industry . The failure to rapidly adopt this new technology was nothing less than an indictment of the American Way of Medicine ... <p> Kaus goes on to explain that Electronic Medical Records never caught on , and the cost savings that Ezra Klein was so full of enthusiasm about never materialized . By " never caught on , " of course , he means " in half the time it was supposed to catch on , " but EMR is n't really the issue here , it 's Ezra Klein 's enamoration with the billion in annual savings that , let 's face it , were always a massive overreach . Even Kaus admits that EMR may yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use becomes more widespread . The problem is with the pie-in-the-sky billion in savings that Klein keeps droning on about . This is Kaus ' knockout punch : <p> Comes now the RAND corporation to tell us that the projected cost-saving benefits of electronic medical records have not materialized . From the NYT 's report ... <p> Nice ! Ezra Klein spends years pimping the billion in annual savings from EMR , and the RAND Corporation comes along and smashes him to bits ! Time for Mickey Kaus to get a face tattoo . Let 's see you chart your way out of this one , chart boy ! <p> Kaus even finishes Klein off with a link to Ezra 's own blog , in which " Klein 's ' Wonkblog ' colleague , Sarah Kliff , ends her recent analysis on a decidedly agnostic note ... " <p> Oh , snap , you just got pushed off the Sarah Kliff ! <p> Here 's the problem : In all of the Ezra Klein posts that Kaus links to , Klein never once mentions the billion in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side-benefit . He seems much more concerned about not dying : <p> Imagine walking into a bank where clerks scrawled all your information in a giant ledger book . You 'd run out and tweet all your friends about this hilarious bank from the 18th century . But we actually let people do this with our medical records , and then some of us die or have serious problems because our records get lost or our doctor 's handwriting is illegible . <p> Indeed , most of the objections raised by Kaus ' experts are of the " EMR will steal your soul ! " variety , objections that are entirely about human error , greed , and fraud , and not at all about the technology . Everyone agrees that this technology , when properly applied , saves lives . <p> Here 's the best part , though . Remember the impressive source that Kaus used to impeach the billion savings that Ezra Klein never , ever touted ? The RAND Corporation ? It turns out Klein 's Wonkblog colleague Sarah Kliff has heard of them : <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . made an optimistic prediction : Digitizing electronic medical records could save the health-care system at least billion annually . <p> That 's right , the source that Mickey Kaus used to refute something Ezra Klein never ever said is actually the source of the thing Kaus is refuting . To quote Mickey Kaus , " Hoaxer , , or just confused ? " <p> The source of Kaus ' stiffie for Ezra Klein is evident in the reference to " Young Ezra Klein , " but the subtextual drama , while amusing , is n't really the point . Surely , Ezra Klein 's career can survive the reproach of Mickey Kaus , and even of Betsy Rothstein . <p> The problem is that any reader of Kaus ' column would come away with a distorted view of Electronic Medical Records , a potentially life-saving technology that Kaus methodically builds a case against , all so he can take down a colleague he obviously does n't like . That 's not how any journalist , even an " opinion " journalist , should handle a life-and-death @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ duty to serve the public , you have a duty not to harm it . If there are any doctors on the fence about adopting EMR , they should n't be swayed by Mickey Kaus ' resentment toward Young Ezra Klein. 
 show last night , Glenn Beck dressed as a doctor and declared the death of the establishment Republican Party , celebrating with an appropriately-themed cake and footage of actual elephants dying . <p> With co-host Pat Gray lying on a gurney a metaphor for the " dead " GOP Beck explained that " the media is celebrating the fact that the GOP is on its death bed and the president did some excessive celebrating at the inauguration as well , ignoring the 60 million Americans who voted against him . " <p> But Beck is n't angry with the president ( wait , did he just break his own moratorium on mentioning " that guy " ? ) over such celebration , because " we 're celebrating the death of the establishment GOP right along with them . " <p> Before showing off the " Death of the GOP " cake on the table behind him , Beck said that he is glad the establishment wing is dead because " they are refusing to confront the cancer within the party ... Republicans who care about winning really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather than sticking to principles . " <p> The conservative host explained that the only difference between the Republicans and the Democrats is " the speed " at which they take us towards an impending fiscal crisis . He then tore into the " establishment Republicans " for wanting to give citizenship to " illegals . " <p> Playing file footage of actual elephants dying ( " really , really sad , " as he described it ) , Beck bid adieu to the GOP elephant , explaining that he is n't sad at all over such a loss . <p> Beck went on to criticize Obama for " blaming Fox News and Rush Limbaugh " for partisan gridlock , saying that it 's a good thing Fox and conservative radio personalities are able to prevent the establishment Republicans from going along with " progressive weasels . " <p> " While the elephant my be dying , " he concluded , " what is n't dying is personal responsibility . How do I know ? You can trust me . I 'm a doctor . " <p> The use of 
 , Erick Erickson , confirmed today that he has declined to renew his contract with CNN . He also confirmed that he will be heading to Fox News Channel . Before he left CNN behind for good , however , Erickson took to his website to thank his former employers and reveal a few insider anecdotes about his time with the hosts and contributors of the Atlanta-based cable news network . <p> Erickson began his farewell post by expressing his sincere gratitude for being able to work at the network " I grew up watching from Dubai and then home in Louisiana . " <p> " For three years I have worked with some of the greatest people I have ever had the joy of meeting , " Erikson said , listing a number of CNN regulars who he said he was proud to know and call colleagues . <p> " Me at CNN was not an easy fit , " Erickson went on . " The first month was tumultuous with several tumultuous times throughout . I liked to think of myself as job security for the public relations department @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left could agree on was that I did not belong at CNN . " <p> One disturbing story comes from the Republican presidential primaries in 2012 when CNN sent Erickson and Roland Martin on the road : <p> I learned that I will never be competitive with Roland Martin on the fashion front , but he makes an excellent road trip companion through South Carolina . One of the most formative moments of my career at CNN was standing outside a hotel with Roland Martin and tourists began handing him luggage and keys as if he worked at the hotel only because he was in a suit . His courteousness to the people when he did not have to be courteous and the fact that in the 21st century that 'd happen at all really struck me profoundly . <p> Erickson concludes his post by thanking CNN for making him a better political pundit and a better person : <p> I had to learn an art form too often missing these days in partisan talk the art of conversation , particularly with those who might disagree with me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who I disagreed with . And I leave deeply caring for those people . <p> " There are ways to say things that draw people to you and ways to say things that push people from you , " Erickson observes .

 guest on Saturday Night Live 's rerun is Maroon 5 , and so viewers can expect to sit through frontman Adam Levine spending several minutes polishing a bland pop-rock turd on live TV . <p> In an era of the show dominated by the likes of Maroon 5 , Karmin , Ke$ha , and Jessie J , it is important to remember that there sometimes can be the occasional badass SNL musical performance . Every now and then , an artist will ( or the genre it represents ) will make a big impression with a memorable set ; and other times , a legendary artist will show exactly why they 've earned that reputation . <p> So as a reminder of those moments , Mediaite presents the most memorable , badass , great , **27;0;TOOLONG SNL performances of all time . <p> Enjoy : <p> You are seeing this message because you have javascript disabled . To use our slideshows you need to enable javascript . There 's no cross domain hackery or tracking voodoo , it 's just some sweet jQuery animations . Please , think of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ version below . I guess . If that 's your thing . <p> Patti Smith - " Gloria " ( 1976 ) This SNL gig cemented Patti Smith 's reputation as a phenomenal live performer before a national audience . Starting out with a low-key piano part , the song builds and builds until it becomes the seething barnstormer that writer Van Morrison intended it to be . <p> Kanye West - " Runaway " ( 2010 ) Whenever Kanye West 's name comes up , there 's sure to be disagreement . Many found this SNL performance to be pretentious and ostentatious ; others embraced those qualities as the hallmarks of Dark West . Consider this writer in the latter camp . On an all-white stage with just a drum machine and an army of ballet dancers , West and guest Pusha T tore through rap 's most famous anthem of self-loathing . <p> Arcade Fire - " Keep the Car Running " ( 2007 ) Arcade Fire 's debut record Funeral was already considered one of the greatest indie records of all time by the time they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did was successfully introduce the magic to a national audience . Years before cookie-cutter bands like Mumford &amp; Sons turned mandolins and banjos into kitsch , Arcade Fire used all sorts of odd instruments to create thoughtful yet anthemic rock destined for arenas . <p> The White Stripes - " Dead Leaves and the Dirty Ground " ( 2002 ) Jack White is the modern day Led Zeppelin all by himself a rock ' n ' roll force to be reckoned with . Yes , Meg White played drums and was one-half of the White Stripes , but this SNL performance was all about Jack 's energy , his guitar work , and his sheer talent as an entertainer . Bonus oddball points for the fact that Sen. John McCain introduced the band ( he was host that evening ) . <p> Frank Zappa and the Mothers of Invention - " I 'm The Slime " ( 1976 ) In the 70s and 80s , Frank Zappa was synonymous with all things strange and oddball . His 1976 SNL performance of " I 'm The Slime " had all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sets oozing slime , Zappa 's face superimposed onto a drum kit , SNL announcer Don Pardo reciting a verse , and Zappa teaching the audience the lyrics via chalkboard . Sheer genius from the guy who went on to put Tipper Gore and the censors in their place at the 1985 PMRC hearings : <p> Paul Simon - " Diamonds on the Soles of Her Shoes " ( 1986 ) Yes , Paul Simon is the furthest thing from " badass . " But context is important , people . In 1986 , apartheid was still raging , and Simon had broken the international cultural boycott to record the fantastic Graceland with South African black musicians . After finishing up some of the sessions , Simon took local choral group Ladysmith Black Mambazo back to the states to make an appearance on SNL and debut his new material . Needless to say , the performance wowed audiences ; and the Graceland tour went on to take South African artists around the world and help bring attention to their homeland 's racial strife . <p> Fear - " Beef Bologna @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Saxophones " ( 1981 ) To this day , hardcore punk band Fear 's 1981 SNL performance would be considered " shocking " to a national audience . John Belushi was a huge fan of the band and lobbied to have them perform during one of the show 's struggling seasons . They were given a separate stage and were allowed to have fans , including Minor Threat 's Ian MacKaye and Belushi himself , start a mosh pit and dance around . As one can imagine , this did n't end well the show had to cut to commercial after the moshers destroyed the set and MacKaye ran on-stage to scream out a few expletives . Welcome to hardcore punk , everyone . <p> Neil Young - " Rockin ' in the Free World " ( 1989 ) After a decade of artistic mediocrity , Neil Young 's legendary status was rusting ... fast . But the TV debut of his . Bush classic " Rockin ' in the Free World " helped revitalize his image as untouchable . Young lunged all over the stage , jumped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and fired off what some critics called " the loudest thing ever heard on TV . " <p> Sinead O'Connor - " War " ( 1992 ) Sinead O'Connor 's 1992 SNL a capella performance of Bob Marley 's " War " has become synonymous with controversial . Long before priests molesting boys became a normal conversation , O ' Connor tried to bring attention to the church 's sex abuse by tearing up a photograph of Pope John Paul II on live television . To a stunned audience , she shouted , " Fight the real enemy ! " after destroying the picture and throwing it at the camera . No one applauded . <p> Massive boycotts of her records ensued , and she was even booed off the stage at a Bob Dylan tribute concert later that year . But alas , she was vindicated years later , when it was discovered that her " enemy " had indeed been working to cover up for his church 's pedophiles . <p> Nirvana - " Territorial Pissings " ( 1992 ) Around the time of this SNL gig , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throne atop the Billboard charts . Grunge was roaring onto the national stage , and Nirvana 's first SNL showed everyone just how powerful the genre could be . <p> The band played their hit " Smells Like Teen Spirit " first , but then returned later in the show to play " Territorial Pissings , " an incredibly aggressive song that led perfectly to the stage 's demise Cobain destroyed his amps , Novoselic threw his bass around , and Grohl tore apart his drum set . Even though the group likely planned to destroy the set , it still felt entirely visceral and organic . <p> Elvis Costello - " Radio , Radio " ( 1977 ) Everyone 's heard the story : both SNL and Columbia Records requested Elvis Costello play his hit " Less Than Zero , " but a few bars into the tune , Costello defied order by stopping his band and directing them to play his anthem " Radio , Radio . " <p> Costello was banned from SNL for twelve years before finally returning in 1989 . So do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a badass. <h> With river blindness 
 's Happening Now this morning , former U.N . Ambassador John Bolton took to defending President Obama 's program of targeted assassinations of Americans abroad , calling it what it is : an extension of Bush-era policies . <p> " It seems to me that the approach that the Obama administration is following is consistent with and really derived from the Bush administration approach to the War on Terror , " Bolton told host Jenna Lee . " And I think it is entirely sensible . Whether it is foreign citizens who are involved with Al Qaeda or American citizens , we are in a war . They have attacked us . We have a congressional authorization to use military force in response . And that 's what 's at stake here . " <p> In a laughable analogy , Bolton then said , " This is not , you know , robbing the 7-Eleven down on the corner . These people are engaged in war against the United States . " <p> Except , you know , when they 're not . Take , for instance , 16-year-old Abdulrahman al-Awlaki @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against the U.S. , was killed for being the son of a terrorist leader . Or , perhaps , the hundreds of women and children killed during strikes on weddings , funerals , etc . <p> Nevertheless , the former Bush official went on to say : " This is not robbing the local Starbucks down at the corner . This is not a criminal law matter . This is an issue that falls under the paradigm of the law of war where the commander-in-chief 's powers are plenary and where we do n't have judicial review of commander-in-chief decisions . And I think it 's a sound case . " <p> Well , now . <p> What 's particularly fascinating about this whole drones ordeal is how many conservatives ( of a less neocon variety ) are jumping to ( rightfully ) criticize the Obama drone program for two reasons : 1 ) The targeted killings seem to represent a vast expansion of executive authority without any oversight ; and 2 ) If this were a Bush program exposed , the media and Democrats would be going wild . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recognize the double-standard ) , and former is even more undeniably true . But one ca n't help but wonder : If this were a Bush program , would those same conservatives be defending it ? I suspect they would , because they were incredibly silent under the Bush administration 's similarly vast expansion of executive authority . In many ways , Bush 's actions set the precedent for Obama 's abuses . <p> In the end , Bolton 's defense of Obama cements an ongoing meme libertarians have shared since this president first took office . We often make the claim that , particularly on issues of foreign policy , there is very little difference between the Democratic and Republican parties . As I 've repeatedly written here before , many of Obama 's policies on civil liberties , the War on Drugs , and executive authority have extended , if not expanded , Bush 's own horrid policies . Thus , the " Barack W. Bush " or " George W. Obama " meme : <p> And , beyond that , the oddest part ? Dedicated liberals like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Obama drone program . <p> Facebook has 1 
 outgoing Defense Sec . Leon Panetta testified before a Senate committee regarding his knowledge of the events leading up to and immediately following the September 11 , 2012 , attack on an American consulate in Benghazi , Libya . He testified that he did not receive any communication from the White House on the night of the attack after initially informing the president of the situation on the ground in North Africa . <p> Panetta testified that he did speak directly with the president on the night of the attack . He said he informed Barack Obama of the ongoing situation and was directed to respond appropriately . <p> Sen. Kelly Ayotte ( R-NH ) asked if the president made any requests for additional information on American security assets that were in the region which could have responded to the ongoing attack . Panetta replied that the president was generally aware of what regional assets could be deployed , but he did not request any specific information on that night . <p> " Did you have any further communications with President Obama that night ? " Ayotte asked . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever call you that night to say , ' how are things going ? What 's going on ? Where 's the consulate ? ' " Ayotte followed up . <p> " No , but we were aware , as we were getting information that was taking place there , particularly when we got information that the ambassador Chris Stevens his life had been lost we were aware that that information went to the White House , " Panetta added . <p> " Did you communicate with anyone else at the White House that night ?

 , a pediatric neurosurgeon at Johns Hopkins Hospital , raised a number of political eyebrows in Washington this week when he took to a stage he shared with President Barack Obama at the National Prayer Breakfast and advocated a number of conservative reforms . On Sunday , the panel guests on CNN 's State of the Union weighed in on whether it was appropriate for Carson to use the forum of the prayer breakfast to advocate for free market reforms to healthcare and a flat tax code . <p> " Whoa , " said CNN anchor Candy Crowley after playing a portion of Carson 's speech in which he linked the biblical principle of proportional tithing to a flat taxation system . <p> " This was really interesting , number one for the venue , number two for the person doing this , " Crowley said . <p> Former Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison ( R-TX ) said that this moment reminded her of an earlier National Prayer Breakfast she attended when Mother Teresa took a stand against abortion . She said that the room became uncomfortable after Mother Teresa came out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say the atmosphere was similar after Carson delivered his speech last week . <p> " I think his other point , his main point , was that political correctness has just gone beyond bizarre , " Hutchison said . " I just thought it was a great message . " <p> Crowley turned to Rep. Jan Schakowsky ( D-IL ) and asked if she found " anything offensive " in Carson 's speech . <p> " I think that there is a political correctness that he was trying to use to appeal to a conservative audience , " Schakowsky said . " I think it 's really not really an appropriate place to make this kind of political speech and to invoke God as his support for that kind of view . " <p> Schakowsky concluded by saying that Carson 's message displayed an " empathy gap " between where the American propel are and where Carson , and other conservatives , want the nation to go . " We need to have an economy that works for everyone , " she concluded . <p> The McDonogh 35 
 the Union drinking game has become a political media cliche , and while delivering tonight 's official Republican rebuttal to President Obama 's address , so did Senator Marco Rubio ( R-FL ) . Tasked with the unfortunate duty of delivering one of the Republican rebuttals , Rubio spent most of his rebuttal alternately attacking the President , and whining about how mean Obama is to Republicans . The rebuttal , though , will be best remembered for a hilariously awkward mid-speech drink , and will surely cement the Curse of the SOTU Rebuttal in the minds of all future would-be party saviors . Unless his head literally explodes , Rand Paul will barely be noticed . <p> Things started to go wrong for Rubio when he tried to say the Rural phrase " the goal of global liberty , " or something like that . A few seconds later , Sen. Rubio was struggling to describe his frustration at the " false choices the President laid out tonight , " and comically reached offscreen for a drink of water , while eyeing the camera like it might steal his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever spoken publicly has to know how that feels , but as far as Rubio is concerned , it was a good night for Bobby Jindal . <p> Here 's the video , from C-Span : <p> Please enable Javascript to watch . <p> Update : Well , no wonder Marco Rubio was so thirsty , they put him closer to the heat lamp than a large fries .

 MSNBC host Martin Bashir dissected a interview that NBC News reporter Luke Russert managed to secure last night with rocker and Second Amendment rights advocate Ted Nugent . In that interview , the outspoken critic of President Barack Obama frequently referenced excrement to express his dissatisfaction with the situation . Bashir opined that the interview indicates that Nugent may be suffering from from some form of scatological fetish . <p> Russert asked Nugent to explain a comment he made about Rep. Jim Langevin ( D-RI ) when the rocker referred to the congressman as having " shit for brains . " Nugent , not backing down from the incendiary comment , explained to that he was using a colloquialism . Nugent added that , in order to truly achieve the figurative condition he described Rep. Langevin as having , it would require " genuine fecal material instead of brain matter . " <p> After asking if he was on " the Punk 'd TV show " during his interview with Russert , Nugent said that he had actually " shit my pants to get out of this interview . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bashir to identify a larger psychological issue that the rocker may be dealing with . <p> " Mr. Nugent appears to have some kind of obsession with fecal matter , " Bashir prefaced a question to Washington Post columnist Jonathan Capehart . " Is this , do you think , a personal fetish or a personal problem ? " <p> " Oh , lord , Martin , " Capehart replied through uncomfortable laughter . Capehart went on to observe that Nugent 's presence at the State of the Union address " highlights just how course our political discourse has become . " <h> Elisa Villanueva Beard 
 Obama is making her second appearance on Late Night with Jimmy Fallon Friday night , and as the show wrote on Twitter , they just " could n't wait " until tonight to show America this epic segment . <p> The last time the first lady was on the show , she brought Jimmy Fallon to the White House where the two competed in a fitness competition to promote her " Let 's Move " campaign to fight obesity . This time , Obama was on Fallon 's turf . <p> Fallon decided to bring back a classic segment from last year 's Father 's Day , " The Evolution of Dad Dancing , " this time recreated as " The Evolution of Mom Dancing , " with some help from the first lady . <p> The two " moms " went through classic dance moves like the " Go Shopping , Get Groceries " and the " Driving The Station Wagon " before Obama put Fallon to shame with her expert version of the " Dougie .

 Beck 's radio show this past week , Dr. Benjamin Carson took a vastly different stance from most conservatives on the issue of gun control , claiming you should n't be able to own semi-automatic weapons in large cities . <p> Carson became a newfound conservative hero last month when he spoke at the National Prayer Breakfast and laid out a series of criticisms of ObamaCare , political correctness , and tax policy right in front of the president himself . Many called the speech " inappropriate " given the apolitical nature of the event , but many conservatives lauded Carson for his " bold " and " sensible " suggestions for policy reform . <p> Asked by Beck for his thoughts on the Second Amendment , Carson gave the popular pro-gun argument : " There 's a reason for the Second Amendment ; people do have the right to have weapons . " <p> But when asked whether people should be allowed to own " semi-automatic weapons , " the doctor replied : " It depends on where you live . " <p> " I think if you live in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm afraid that that semi-automatic weapon is going to fall into the hands of a crazy person , I would rather you not have it , " Carson elaborated . <p> However , if you live " out in the country somewhere by yourself " and want to own a semi-automatic weapon , he added , " I 've no problem with that .

 has officially selected 76-year-old Argentinian Cardinal Jorge Mario Bergoglio to succeed Pope Benedict XVI as the next pope . He has taken on the regnal name Pope Francis I. <p> Previous popes have come under fire from political leaders for their conservative views on issues like same-sex marriage , homosexuality , and abortion things which church teachings generally forbid . Bergoglio is reportedly considered among the most doctrinally conservative cardinals in Latin America . <p> To wit : <p> On same-sex marriage : The new pope has called gay marraige " a scheme to destroy God 's plan " and " a real and dire anthropological throwback . " In 2010 , he was a vocal opponent of the Argentinian government 's proposed legislation to legalize same-sex marriage . <p> On abortion : He has rallied his clergy against the " culture of death " that is the pro-abortion movement . <p> On contraceptives : The new pope strongly opposed Argentinian President Cristina Fern ? ndez de Kirchner 's efforts to distribute free contraceptives , likely seeing it as part of the aforementioned " culture of death .

 in Connecticut aired a segment yesterday about the " celebration of women " highlighting Women 's History Month and a related event that lauded women 's accomplishments in the state . And what better way to celebrate how far women have come than with footage of women 's breasts ? <p> Needless to say , this elicited a bad reaction and the station later apologized for the " file footage error . " The station tweeted : <p> The Permanent Commission on the Status of Women , which hosts Annual Women 's Day , issued a statement calling out the station for sexism and objectifying women : <p> " We are appalled at the level of sexism this incident shows . It is an insult not only to the Permanent Commission on the Status of Women and to all who attended Women 's Day at the Capitol , which marked the PCSW 's 40-year battle against gender discrimination , but to women everywhere who are tired of being objectified .

 his show tonight with a New Rule that took on conservative groups for their disproportionate influence on the American political landscape considering just how small they are . Maher deemed this " shitkicker inflation " and called out every group from One Million Moms to the NRA for claiming to speak for the majority but really vocalizing the opinions of a small minority . <p> Maher opened by mocking conservative outrage over a Geico ad with the little pig mascot and a Skittles ad with a woman and a walrus . In both cases , groups like One Million Moms was outraged over tones of bestiality , to which Maher rebutted , " Are n't you thinking a little too much about bestiality ? " <p> Maher said that all things conservative are being portrayed as way bigger than they really are , like the fact that One Million Moms does not have one million moms , or how the Catholic League ( a group Maher said makes even Pat Robertson roll his eyes ) is not really a league . He argued both are a " relatively small group of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ politicians think their constituents are more conservative than they actually are . <p> Maher claimed , " Americans do n't hate socialism , they just ca n't define it . " He also targeted the NRA for having a stranglehold on gun policy in the U.S. despite low gun ownership figures and their small membership . <p> Maher ended by turning to CPAC , the message of which he said was " whatever you do , do n't change . " He shot down the idea being touted by speakers at the conservative conference that they speak for the majority of Americans , saying that they do n't , but " they 're just so loud they have n't noticed America has moved on without them .

 a bit of a sensation this past weekend when he tweeted a photo of the Devil from The History Channel 's The Bible mini-series and noted that beared a resemblance to " that guy " ( AKA President Obama ) . Last night on CNN , Erin Burnett used her opinion-laden " Erin 's Essay " segment to go after Beck for what she saw as just another instance of his tendency to compare the president to Satan . <p> Burnett clearly took offense to Beck 's tweet , saying perhaps he calls President Obama " that guy " because he " does n't respect him enough to use his title . " She then offered up a montage of prior instances when Beck drew the comparison in more pointed political contexts . The final nail in the coffin of the segment came when Burnett showed video of another political figure who has been known to compare President Obama to the devil : Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad . Presumably , Beck would n't appreciate that juxtaposition . <p> After the segment aired , Burnett even referred to Beck 's " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ segment online : <p> Beck has not yet responded to Burnett , either on Twitter or on his radio show . <h> House committee leader 
 , MSNBC President Phil Griffin did n't name Denis Horgan , that was already his name . He named him executive producer of the forthcoming 8 pmChris Hayes show , which has n't been named yet . The show , that is , not the executive producer . Horgan comes from MSNBC 's digital team , and has had a hand in the creation of several MSNBC shows , including Hayes ' old show . With the naming of Horgan ( as executive producer ) , the pieces are falling into place for MSNBC 's 8 pm offering , while keeping the steady hand of Jonathan Larsen at the helm of the Up . <p> From MSNBC 's press release : <p> Denis Horgan has been named Executive Producer of the new Chris Hayes program , which will debut on April 1 at 8 p.m . ET on MSNBC . The announcement was made by Phil Griffin , President of MSNBC . <p> " Denis is a creative force and I look forward to working with him and Chris at 8 p.m. , " said Griffin . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chris Hayes , and I ca n't wait to put this show on TV , " said Horgan . <p> Over the past three years , Horgan has been a key member of Phil Griffin 's team , helping with the creation and development of several MSNBC programs including " The Last Word with Lawrence O'Donnell " and " UP with Chris Hayes " , and has worked closely with most of the programs in the MSNBC lineup while playing a key creative role in the development of MSNBC 's digital strategy . Horgan originally joined MSNBC in 2003 as Senior Producer of " Countdown with Keith Olbermann . " <p> From 2007-2010 , Horgan served as Vice President of Community Development at TopCoder , Inc. where he managed and grew a global online community of 300,000 programmers , developers and graphic designers . He began his career at ESPN Radio Network where he served as Senior Producer for a number of programs including " The Tony Kornheiser Show " . <p> Horgan is a graduate of the University of Hartford 's College of Arts &amp; Sciences . <p> I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Chris Hayes ' book , Twilight of the Elites . As you might expect , he was an enthusiastic booster of MSNBC , with an evangelical fervor approaching that of network head Phil Griffin . As I recall , he had an excellent grasp of the steps it took to build to the success that MSNBC now enjoys , including Griffin 's push for new talent , which will be key to his new position . <p> Horgan 's move also wisely leaves Jonathan Larsen in place as Up ( now with ) Steve Kornacki 's executive producer , which will go a long way toward continuing the success that show has built on weekends . The production and mix of guests are key ingredients to that show 's alchemy , and Kornacki is a good match for the show 's format and temperature . <p> That still leaves Hayes ' show without a name , and unfortunately , both The Chris Hayes Show and The Chris Show have an awkward Rural Juror thing going on . After rejecting a few ideas ( Straight Hayes ? and Confused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hayes O'Clock , with the tagline " It 's Hayes O'Clock : Do You Know Where Your Politics Are ?

 's Up with Chris Hayes , host Chris Hayes said farewell to the show by delivering a sincere thank you to the folks who put it together , an endorsement of future Up host Steve Kornacki , and a promise to bring the Up ethos O'Clock ( or whatever his 8 pm show will be called ) . Hayes also signed off with a sight gag , toasting the audience with a historic last bite from the famous Up pastry plate , and had to plow through the last minute or so with a mouthful of muffin . Where 's Marco Rubio 's water when you need it ? <p> Hayes began by talking about how much he learned as Up host , " the best job in TV , maybe the best job in the world , " crediting the eclectic mix of panelists and guests , as well as the , the community of loyal viewers who take the show 's conversations to Twitter , and mix with the occasional fan of amphetamines . <p> " If you 're a fan of the show , " Hayes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for 4:50 on a Saturday morning like a maniac , you should know I have very , very good news . " <p> He praised new host Steve Kornacki as a " fantastic analyst " who is " curious and deeply kind and good-natured , " adding that " if you crave deep knowledge , you 're going to love Steve . " <p> On all counts , Hayes is on the mark about Kornacki , but it is his relentless cheerfulness that sets Steve apart from other possible Up replacements . The show 's signature mix of diverse opinions requires a host who is able to thread the needle between spirited debate and the kind of cheap cable news conflict that Up eschews . Hayes had a tendency to err on the side of giving peace a chance when things got heated , so it will be interesting to see if Kornacki let 's those flames breathe a little . Not all conflict is cheap ; sometimes , it 's revealing . It will also be interesting to see if Steve can deploy the killer instinct that 's sometimes necessary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ points " memo . Hayes sometimes let stuff slide in the interest of keeping the conversation going , and Steve 's kind nature might tempt him to do the same . <p> Chris also gave a well-deserved shout-out to Up Executive Producer Jonathan Larsen , who is remaining with the show , and is the key reason viewers can count on the show retaining its soul . The elements that have made it successful , the mix of guests who can manage to be interesting at 8 am on a Saturday , the structure of the show 's closely-related segments , the camera work that you do n't notice , but that conveys the relationships that make Up go , all are overseen by Larsen . <p> Hayes also promised his prospective new audience that his new show will incorporate what they like best about Up . " If you enjoy the show , and format , and spirit of conversation and curiosity and openness , " he said , " we 're going to preserve those essential features weeknights at 8 pm in my new time slot . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the news with rigor and passion . You 'll have an opportunity to follow stories , as they arc across the week and intervene in the national conversation , about politics , policy and culture . " <p> That 's an awfully big promise to fit into an hour , and a risk that will put Phil Griffin 's vision for the channel to the test . He 's not likely to lose viewers to Bill O'Reilly , but a sharp departure from cable news formula will have its work cut out for it . Hayes will be competing , mainly , against the blinding white light of CNN 's Anderson Cooper , and a program of easily-digestible news of the day . Hayes O'Clock will need to grip viewers without using the Vise Grips found in the standard cable news toolkit , which is a tall order . <p> Hayes concluded his valediction with a characteristically activist-y nod to his staff . " Finally , " he said , " you should know the way TV is produced and presented has a nasty tendency to reproduce a lot about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm committed to fighting against . Every weekend you watch this show , you see my name and face . What you do n't see are the dozens of people who work here , on set , and in the makeup room , and the control room , and the incredible , brilliant funny staff of us who breathe life into this show every weekend . If you enjoy this show , you 're enjoying their work as much as mine . everything we touch in our lives , the shirts on our backs , the keyboard you type on and the coffee you drink is produced by a chain of human beings we never meet but who pour forth their labor for the things we love . To those who have done that with vigor and joy and brilliance at Up , thank you .

 , TheTeaParty.net , arguably the largest ' Tea Party ' organization , appeared to urge a boycott of Starbucks over same-sex marriage . <p> The non-profit organization 's Facebook page , which boasts over 1.6 million ' Likes ' , posted the following link to ' Dump Starbucks ' : <p> In under 24 hours , the post has received over 13,000 ' Likes ' and garnered thousands of comments , mostly in support . <p> The controversy stems from an exchange during the Starbucks annual shareholders meeting last week , in which Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz strongly reaffirmed the company 's support for same-sex marriage . When questioned by Starbucks shareholder , Tom Strobhar ( who is also founder of The Corporate Morality Action Center ) , whether the company 's support for same-sex marriage was hurting its stock price , Schultz noted the company 's decision was not about economics but about embracing diversity , adding ( to wild applause from the crowd ) : <p> " If you feel , respectfully , that you can get a higher return than the 38 percent you got last year , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shares of Starbucks and buy shares in another company . Thank you very much . " <p> The petition and website that ' Tea Party ' linked to , , seems to the same website used in last year 's boycott against Starbucks by the National Organization for Marriage ( N.O.M. ) , a group that promotes traditional marriage . That initial boycott arose shortly after the Seattle-based coffee giant , in January 2012 , issued a press release expressing its support for the State of Washington 's legislation recognizing same-sex marriage . <p> It is difficult to determine whether N.O.M. 's 2012 boycott had any direct effect on the company 's bottom line but , based on share price , it does not appear to have had a impact . The day NOM announced its boycott , Starbucks shares were trading at about a share . One month later , shares were trading at about a share . ( Starbucks 's latest share price , on March 25th , closed at , in case you 're curious . ) <p> The ' Dump Starbucks ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however , how many of these are in response to the latest incident , or rather signatories carried over from the website 's initial posting one year ago . It appears many of the signatures are not new , as the site had already had over 35,000 signatures in May 2012 ( as pictured here ) . <p> Both same-sex marriage and traditional marriage advocates have used boycotts repeatedly . Chick-fil-A faced a boycott last year due to its affiliation with socially conservative groups , leading conservatives to counter by rallying behind the chain . ( In fact , Palin was spotted wearing a Chick-fil-A shirt this weekend . ) And in 2011 , gay rights groups announced a boycott against Target due a controversial political donation . <p> On Twitter , many are expressing their plans to #BoycottStarbucks : <p> It remains to be seen whether this new call to boycott Starbucks will gain any steam . But one thing is certain CEO Howard Schultz will likely not be concerned either way . @ @ @ @ of 
 In The History Of Cable News : An Anderson Griffin Series On CNN <p> In life , there are a handful of moments when we remember exactly where we were when hearing the news ... <p> When the Challenger blew up , I was in my 7th Grade English class ( lest anyone believe this reveals my age today , it should be noted I was like the Doogie Howser of Wayne , New Jersey ... placed in classes with those far older ) . <p> When the Devils won their first Stanley Cup , I was riding down to Long Beach Island on the Garden State Parkway , listening on the radio after attending my aunt 's wedding . <p> When Bin Laden was killed , I was in bed sleeping with my Blackberry . Rolled over , saw the update in a mass email , smiled , rolled back over , and went back to sleep . <p> So it 's safe to say that I remember where I was ten minutes ago at 8:10 PM EST when I heard the apocalyptic ( unconfirmed ) report that CNN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cooper and Kathy Griffin at Time Warner Studios in New York , according to Deadline.com . <p> My reaction caused paint chips to fall off my ceiling : <p> " NOOOOOOOOOO ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! " <p> It 's one thing to put the Cooper and Griffin together on New Year 's Eve : Most folks watching that night are already overserved , likely older ( See : Not out , but struggling to stay awake until midnight and watching a cable news network 's coverage of the ball dropping in Times Square in the process ) . Some tune to CNN because somewhere in the back of their brain , they recall reading about Griffin doing something provocative , something wild in the past , like dropping a F-bomb or performing an oral rendition on her openly gay co-host ( not that there 's anything wrong with that ) . So they tune in to witness the bit , perhaps for no other reason but lack of a better idea . <p> The next day , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . FOX News is horrified on behalf of its viewers ( who , you know ... likely were n't watching in the first place ) , so they replay it again , eviscerating the CNN in the process . <p> CNN really does n't have to do this , particularly with Cooper . Take last Sunday night : Cooper did a riveting , utterly fascinating 60 Minutes package on killer crocs by actually swimming with them . These crocs kill an average of 200 people a year , and Anderson revealed after there was no " Plan B " if one of them actually attacked him . The piece has since been the toast of media critics and social media . It was the type of stuff you could only wish to see on CNN more . <p> Meanwhile , Griffin , 52 , is every bit the D-list ( pun intended ) , attention-seeking , magnet for vitriol you hear about . Yes , she has won two Emmys for best reality program over the past decade , but beating out Snooki and JWoww or Sarah Palin 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Having the comedienne on once a year is one thing . Having her on a regular basis with Cooper who has already failed doing the light stuff during his recently-cancelled syndicated talk-show is quite another . Ultimately it could be an exercise that would run out of " shocking " content so quickly , become so awkward , so utterly awful ( considering the network , the venue ) , that it could ultimately be an error so egregious that CNN and Jeff Zucker may never recover . <p> If today 's pilot was a trial balloon to see what the reaction would be , let 's just say that the overwhelming , landslide , North is almost 100 percent against a show from ever coming to fruition . <p> CNN recently hired Zucker , Chris Cuomo and Jake Tapper . That 's a good start so far , but as stated in this space , much more serious work has to be done in order to recapture second place again in the cable news race . <p> And if this idea is anything beyond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of at least three careers at CNN ... <p> " In a

 host Greta Van Susteren took to her blog on Thursday where she opened up about her relationship with a stalker who shadowed nearly her every move in the 1980s . In the revealing post , Van Susteren discusses how her stalker made her feel , and how she came to have a complicated relationship with both him and his family . <p> " Fox News anchor Shannon Bream and I were talking the other night in my office about stalkers , " Van Susteren began . She told Bream that she had a stalker herself for " 5-7 years in the 1980s " while she was practicing law . <p> " He had a weird look , " Van Susteren revealed of her stalker , Randy Lokke . " His hair was never combed , hung in his face and he had an awkward twitch and grin . " <p> Over the years and years of him stalking me , I spoke to his family about trying to get him to stop ... his Mother was very sweet to me and understood why I was distressed by the situation .... the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and held him overnight ( I always thought they did it because they thought it would look bad if I a defense lawyer were found murdered and floating in the Potomac River when they were aware of the problem and had done zero ) ... I tried everything to get rid of him ... I was nice to him to get rid of him ... mean to him to get rid of him ... ignored him etc . Nothing worked . He was fixated . It was really weird every place I would go , he would be there ... with me . He could find me . It was almost as if he had my phone bugged , too . I had dinner one night with a friend and there he was ! Worse , he stood next ( yes , next ! ) to the table overlooking us and just grinning . It not only was weird , it must have looked weird to everyone else in the restaurant . I had the restaurant make him leave . <p> And then , Van Susteren learned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away . " Strangely , I felt bad , " Van Susteren confessed . " He had followed me for so many years that I felt I knew him quite well . " <p> She went into extensive detail about the many experiences she and her professional colleagues in law had with Lokke and their extensive efforts to get him to desist in his stalking all to no avail . <p> People asked me why I never tried to get him arrested ( other than that one arrest by the US Attorney ) and the answer is simple : he violated no law and you ca n't arrest someone for lawful conduct . There were no anti-stalking laws at the time . <p> " I had no fear of Randy , " Van Susteren wrote . " I was used to him . He was really weird ... and a pest ... but after years of him stalking me and being a pest , I had no fear . " <p> Finally , she added , himself ceased his stalking activities when he " dropped me " for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ student . " <p> " Imagine getting dumped by your stalker ! " Van Susteren exclaimed . She saaid that she and her husband ran into Lokke about two years ago while he was bicycling around and wearing only a swimsuit . <p> It is weird , but I feel bad about Randy . He obviously had some weird problem . He was a troubled person . It turned out he was not dangerous ... he was just weird and a pest .... but how would anyone have known ? <h> Sober Shot : 
 marriage equality was front and center this afternoon on Fox News Watch as the panelists debated the level of objectivity in the coverage and whether the issue was one of the most important of our time . <p> Jim Pinkerton of American Conservative Magazine said he thinks it is one of the biggest issues of our time though it may not be as important as the economy . He does think the press thinks it is one of the most important issues . " The media certainly thinks it is a big story , " said Pinkerton . <p> " I think it was pretty one sided because I think that reflects public opinion , especially young public opinion in America . I think the basic divide is between people who see this as a political issue in which intelligent people can disagree and others who see it as a basic human , civil right . If you 're in the later camp then you ca n't have enough coverage of it , " said Fox News contributor Judith Miller <p> The Daily Beast 's Kirsten Powers viewed the issue as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be the ones that overwhelmingly in support of gay marriage and older people are the ones who are n't . I think the media is more populated by people on the younger scale , so that 's going to be their point of view , " said Powers . <p> Conservative columnist Cal Thomas expressed frustration with the coverage saying that the media is driving the coverage . " I have n't seen so much cheerleading for an issue since that done by the media for President Obama , " said Thomas . <p> Ed Sheeran and 
 's White Student Union the " future of organized hate " ? Its founder Matthew Heimbach does n't think so , but others are n't so sure and the group 's drawn controversy recently , especially following its plans to patrol the campus in response to black-on-white crime . Heimbach spoke to CNN 's David Mattingly in an interview that aired on Erin Burnett 's OutFront , defending the organization and its goals . <p> The Southern Poverty Law Center 's Mark Potok argued that the last time we heard this type of message it was from " the Reconstruction-era Klan . " <p> His group , last year , took writing phrases like " white pride " across campus . " No longer will the homosexual , Muslim , and black supremacist groups be allowed to hijack our campus , " Heimback remarked . <p> Towson University President Loeschke said the group is trying to promote " white supremacy issues " and " issues of non-inclusion . " Specifically , Heimbach has complained about crime on campus and did n't take well to Mattingly 's question about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black group , they 'd be hailed as " heroes . " <p> That wave of crime " appears to be invented , " the segment noted . Pressed on the decline in the crime and the fact that Towson is the safest of Maryland 's universities , Heimbach insisted the numbers do back him up . Given that Heimbach has n't broken any rules , Mattingly noted , the university ca n't do much about his efforts though that have said there will be a stronger police presence to ensure " the entire campus community continues to feel safe and comfortable .

 Dr. Ben Carson illustrates a national crisis that has been ignored and tolerated for far too long . <p> Carson , a renowned neurosurgeon , burst onto the national scene with his resounding National Prayer Breakfast address in February . His conservative views have made him the Right 's newest star . The inconvenient fact that he is an African-American conservative does not sit well with the Left , however , which has hammered away at Carson since Day One with a variety of methods ranging from dismissing him , ridiculing him , attempting to drive a wedge between Carson and conservatives , and ( most recently ) a full-on attack over Carson 's gay-marriage remarks last week ( a matter that should not have provoked a controversy , as I wrote on this site ) . <p> On his show Monday night , during a heated segment regarding Dr. Carson , Sean Hannity noted : <p> " If you 're African-American and you 're conservative , you are vilified . You are demonized , you are called names , you are attacked . That is the ongoing epidemic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for African-American conservatives in America . " <p> Does Hannity have a point ? In short , yes . <p> First , consider what was demonstrated in that very segment . Leo Turell , not a fan of Dr. Carson 's , bizarrely railed that Dr. Carson 's profession disqualifies him from speaking on political issues , stating : " Ben Carson , you 're a doctor , you 're not a politician ! .... I know what I 'm talking about , I 'm a lawyer ! .... I 've got the credentials ! " <p> Huh ? Ask yourself : Is that an argument often employed ? And is there an underlying tone that this African-American doctor should keep quiet and know his place ? <p> Second , as guest Niger Innis ( National Spokesman for the Congress of Racial Equality ) rightly noted , there is a " litany of horrors " spoken by the Left that are not dissected with the same level of outrage as are Dr. Carson 's . Curiously , many of those remarks instead are praised as thought-provoking , go unnoticed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free pass . <p> As the Left has consistently demonstrated throughout the years , trump all . The fact that Carson is a stunning role model for the country , and for African-Americans in particular , is brushed under the rug as irrelevant , in favor of discrediting this black conservative . Dating back to Justice Clarence Thomas 's confirmation or even further , there is a special level of vitriol reserved for black conservatives , who dared break rank . According to general liberal orthodoxy , blacks do and must believe that racism is rampant , that minorities can not get ahead without special help , and that Big Government solutions are the road to blacks ' prosperity . <p> Those who combat this narrative are not suffered gladly . <p> Try being a black conservative who does not support Obama . Inconceivable ! Try being a Latino who does not rush to support amnesty for illegal immigrants . Inconceivable ! Try being any minority who does not rush to see issues through the prism of race or ethnicity . Inconceivable ! And try being a minority who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not only a matter of how few will give you a voice or listen but rather the many who will try to silence you . <p> As a conservative Latina , I directly experience , often on a daily basis , the difficulty of being a minority who did not and does not ' toe the line . ' Due to my political views , I have been called a sellout , a traitor , heartless , ashamed of my ethnicity , and even a ' wetback ' ( no , the Left is not above using racial slurs ) . Many are the moments in which I consider it would be best to keep quiet . I suspect this struggle is even tougher for black conservatives a sitting target for the Left , theirs is no enviable position . <p> ' Freedom of speech for me but not for thee , black conservatives ! ' ... or so the Left shouts with its actions . Sorry , Dr. Carson , but if you wish to make your views heard , it seems you must check either your skin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Left loves diversity just not your kind . <p> Imagine a scenario 
 Rutgers basketball coach Mike Rice was the top story this afternoon on Fox News ' The Five , with the hosts asking why the university only decided to make the move after the video of Rice abusing his players physically and verbally went viral . While most of the hosts agreed that Rice 's behavior was highly inappropriate , Eric Bolling stood alone in defending the coach against what he called " the wussification of American men . " <p> Bolling said this story " infuriates " him , adding , " We 're in the midst of political correctness crushing our ability to teach kinds , to discipline kids , to disagree with people or one another or kids . Our culture is in decline , but this is an example of our culture in free fall and I 'm saying this because he got fired , not because of what he did . " <p> " I talk about the wussification of American men , and this is it , " Bolling continued before describing some the abuse he himself received during his high school sports career . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he asked , " with all of the , the , the and basically making men chihuahuas ? " <p> Suffice it to say , the other members of the panel did not agree with Bolling . Bob Beckel , in particular , laid into Rice 's actions , calling them the behavior of a " mad man " who " deserves to be in a mental institution . " <p> Catch a few 
 " Lean Forward " spot featuring Melissa Harris-Perry is a collection of tired progressive cliches on steroids that harken back to the Clinton era . It really outdoes all previous " Lean Forward " ads . <p> The 30 second spot features Harris-Perry standing on a curving street near some pretty flowers and speaking in the matter-of-fact style that helped land her a weekend show on the progressive cable outlet . There 's so much about this short spot that 's just troubling and wrong that we have to break it down piece by piece . <p> We have never invested as much in public education as we should have because ... <p> Yeah , no . We spend more on education per-student than every country in the world according to the latest OECD Education at a Glance report . If you want to twist the numbers more and view our spending as a percentage of our GDP we come in a very close fifth behind Denmark , New Zealand , Iceland , and South Korea . So Harris-Perry 's allegation that " we have never invested as much in public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In order for it to be remotely true we 'd have to spend a significantly smaller amount of money on education than we currently do . Not only do we invest more than enough but we still manage to get pretty terrible results despite all the money we throw at education . <p> ... we 've always had a private notion of children , your kid is yours and totally your responsibility . We have n't had a very collective notion of these are our children . So part of it is we have to break through our kind of private idea that kids belong to their parents or kids belong to their families and recognize that kids belong to whole communities . <p> There 's some startling stuff in there . Kids do n't just belong to their parents ; in Harris-Perry 's world they belong to the collective whole , the community . They are the responsibility of everyone . She is right to some extent on this concept . We are forced to pay for the education of minors in our communities through some form of taxation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we , well , lose our homes and end up in jail . So , we are forced into some level of collective action to take care of our neighbors kids even if we do n't want to . I think most Americans , particularly parents , are quite alright with the level of collectivism that they are currently forced to engage in and probably do n't want to live in Harris-Perry 's dream world where the lines of parent , neighbor , and state all blur together into some nightmarish borg . <p> Once it 's everybody 's responsibility and not just the household 's we start making better investments . <p> Again , the collective " responsibility " of raising children has already been technically forced on everybody through taxation . The investments she is vaguely talking about have already been made repeatedly and they are often gold-plated , too . This broader collective theme of child rearing she has should be roundly rejected by all sane people . Pooling community resources together to educate our children , even if it is done by force , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traditional bonds between parent and child for the good of the greater collective is off the charts crazy . <h> Wisconsin 's Family 
 The O'Reilly Factor , Bill O'Reilly and guests discussed the hiring of radical Leftists by universities and the recent crop of stories concerning liberal professors ' controversial classroom acts . Joining him to discuss were were Bob Zelnick , journalism professor at Boston University , and Fox News radio host Todd Starnes . <p> O'Reilly criticized Columbia University 's hiring earlier this month of former " Weather Underground radical " Kathy Boudin , adding that colleges across the country are hiring " radical left people . " <p> In 1981 , when she was 38 years old , Boudin , along with several members of the Weather Underground and Black Liberation Army , participated in an armed robbery of a Brinks armored car , taking million in cash . When police caught up to the getaway car ( a U-Haul ) , Boudin , according to police testimony , reportedly exited the getaway truck , feigned innocence and , when the officers dropped their weapons , six of the men in the back of the getaway truck appeared with automatic weapons , overwhelming the four police officers . Two officers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ death toll to three . Boudin served 22 years in prison and was paroled in 2003 . <p> In her new Columbia post , Boudin is a professor of social work . ( Her bio on the university 's website makes no mention of her past crimes . ) <p> O'Reilly and Starnes noted the controversy over Darry Sragow , a political science professor at the University of Southern California who was videotaped , by one of his students , attacking Republicans , including Sragow calling Republicans " really stupid and racist " and " old white guys . " O'Reilly bemoaned that this is " going on everywhere " and doubts there is a solution , in light of the " stranglehold on the university system . " Starnes suggested that the solution lies in conservative students taking action , such as the student who filmed Sragow , or the student who spoke out against the classroom exercise of stomping on the word ' Jesus , ' involving Florida Atlantic University 's Dr. Deandre Poole . Starnes added that these kinds of incidents are " getting worse , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the school that found " young liberals are even more intolerant . " <p> Zelnick noted that " the Left acts up , when the Left feels threatened , " citing their response to McCarthyism , and that they are possibly fearful because " they are on the cusp of victory and they want to make sure that it does n't slip away this time as it has in the past .

 New Gun Laws Will Not Make A ' Particle Of Difference ' <p> Washington Post columnist George Will dismissed the idea that any of the legislation being proposed by the House or Senate will an impact on gun violence in the United States . Will added that the president has spend the most valuable part of his second term on this legislation , too , and is barely getting any of the things he wanted with regards to guns through Congress . <p> At one time it seemed like a ban on so-called assault weapons , along with high capacity magazines , was likely to become the law of the land but less than four months after the massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School it appears those proposals are going nowhere . Now , the only part of President Obama 's call for gun reform that is being given serious consideration , universal background checks , is in jeopardy , too . <p> " He has spent an inordinate amount of time and energy in what will be the most precious moments of his second term probably , the early months @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what are meretriciously called ' assault weapons ' , that are simply semi-automatic weapons , of all weapons sold in this country , we 're not going to get universal background checks , we 're not going to get a ban on magazines , " Will said . <p> " Does anyone at this table believe that when the Senate and House do whatever they 're going to do that it will make a particle of difference in preventing future Sandy Hooks ? " said Will , banging his hand on the table . <p> Washington Post columnist Ruth Marcus said she thinks whatever is passed will make a difference . She add that she thinks " we 're at an extraordinary moment when it 's easier for Democrats and Republicans to support same sex marriage than it is to support the same law passed in 1994 . " <p> The 1994 law she is referring to is the original assault weapons ban that was part of the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994. @ @ A view of 
 CNN have it over its erroneous reporting that an arrest had been made in the case of the Boston Marathon bombing . Stewart mocked how much CNN kept boasting of its " exclusive reporting , " which turned ot to be exclusive " because it was completely fucking wrong , " and was even more blown away by how CNN was subsequently backing away from and questioning that very report . Stewart described this as the network " shitting in their own mouths , " christening CNN " the Human Centipede of News . " <p> Stewart asked , " Did any of your sources end their tip-offs to you with the phrase ' Ba ba booey ? ' " And when CNN just dropped the story altogether , Stewart called it a " news story as imagined by M. Night Shyamalan . " <p> But perhaps the best part for Stewart was the hour-long gap between the initial breaking news and the eventual confirmed walk-back in which CNN anchors attempted to clarify and walk back the report of the arrest . Stewart viewed this as CNN removing the middle-man and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Or , as Stewart more colorfully put it , " the Human Centipede of news . " <p> Stewart then brought on correspondent John Oliver who , with the help of Jessica Williams , narrowed the identity of the bombing suspect down to either a " dark-skinned male , possible white , or maybe a woman , " " a fat Hispanic baby , " or " a dog on its hind legs wearing glasses and a hat . " <h> Q+A : Of 
 Judge All Caucasians By The Actions Of A Few <p> Since the identification and apprehension ( both dead and alive ) of Boston Marathon bombing suspects Tamerlan Tsarnaev ( reportedly shot and run over with explosives strapped to him , amid unconfirmed reports he was clutching an " ACME Co. " receipt ) and Dzokhar Tsarnaev ( apprehended as a result of history 's first heroic nicotine fit ) , there has been a rush to triumphantly point and laugh at liberal commentator David Sirota 's preference that the bombers turn out to be like the cheese on his ham sandwich : white and American . As it happens , both of them turned out to be Caucasian , and one of them was American , but we ca n't allow their actions to define all Caucasian-Americans . <p> Lucky for white Americans , Sirota was at least half-right : when perpetrators of horrific acts turn out to be white , there is some phenomenon that causes their whiteness to become completely irrelevant , even if they are actually from the place where whiteness gets its name . Until Friday , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that some fancy racist thought up to make white people sound better than " negroids " and " mongoloids , " but it turns out there 's a real place called Caucasia , and the Boston bombing suspects are from it . <p> Despite that fact , and despite the fact that their region of origin has been heavily reported as " the Caucasas , " you would never know that these guys were Caucasian , let alone white , from the way cable news has been reporting on them . With the exception of Sunday morning 's Melissa Harris-Perry show , the only cable news description of the suspects as " Caucasian " came from Massachusetts State Police Col. Tim Alben , during a press conference . <p> That 's because David Sirota did n't count on the one possibility that could nullify a white American bomber : a white American Muslim bomber . Whatever you think of Sirota 's expression of his premise , or the timing of it , the results support it : white privilege means never having to say you 're sorry for what other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The skin color that was so relevant early in the week disappeared like a white rabbit in a hat , replaced by a Muslim rabbit with no discernible coloration . Ta-daaa ! <p> The flipside of the white privilege that Sirota described was discussed concisely and effectively by Melissa Harris-Perry 's panel Sunday morning . Muslim-American researcher Zaheer Ali pointed out that " Many Muslims around the country , before the identities of the suspects were known , said ' Please do n't let them be Muslim , ' " and recalled , similarly , " growing up , we said please do n't be black , right ? " <p> " You had a case that at the Boston Marathon where a young 20-year-old Saudi was running like everybody else from the bombing , and he was tackled because he was suspected as being one of the bombers , " he added , " so being Muslim in America post 9/11 is being both being a victim of terror , and also being afraid of being a suspect of terror . " <p> Sikh-American activist and film-maker Valarie Kaur @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Let 's remember that the Oak Creek mass shooting was actually the last incident of domestic terrorism in this country , " she said . " It was committed by a white supremacist who walked into a Sikh house of worship . We did not hear calls for white people to be profiled , we did not hear Christianity denigrated , or Christians living in fear . The way that our country diagnoses a problem when it 's a white perpetrator , it 's an individual problem . " <p> Professor Michael Eric Dyson summed it up best , saying that " This is what it means to be black in America , as well as many other religious minorities . The evil stuff , the bad stuff we do is seen as representative . The great stuff we do is seen as exceptional . The exceptional people can never be representative of the group , and the evil people are the only representatives , or the people who do bad things are the only representatives . White Americans do n't if Tom Cruise goes down , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 're done . " <p> Please enable Javascript to watch . <p> But it 's not just being Muslim that obscures the whiteness of " big C " and " little c " caucasians alike . When white perpetrators of mass horror are involved , media figures will latch onto even the most irrelevant of descriptors to define them . The Aurora mass shooter was alternately described as a Tea Partier and autistic , neither of which was even true , but when was the last time someone falsely claimed " some white dude " did it ? This does n't feel like a privilege , but that 's the entire point of white privilege : you have to not enjoy it to see it . <p> In the Boston Marathon bombing suspects , we have a test case that seems to conclusively prove Sirota 's broader point : the minute they were identified as white , their skin simply ceased to exist . That would n't be the case if they were more " visibly " Muslim , like that Saudi student who was wrongly targeted . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might have noticed them straining through the crowd with 20-pound-plus backpacks , and placing them on the sidewalk unattended , or have picked up on some other behavioral tic . As irrelevant as skin color is when it is mentioned , failure to mention it now promotes an unearned comfort with those who look more like us. <p> Women are their 
 president of the Council on Foreign Relations , shared some sobering analysis with the panel guests on ABC News ' This Week on Sunday . He said that the Boston Marathon bombings were not merely an isolated event , but the harbinger of a new era of global terrorism with a low barrier to entry . He said that the future of terrorism will look more like the attack on the Boston Marathon than September 11 , 2001 . <p> ABC News Chief Global Affairs Correspondent Martha Raddatz asked why , when there were red flags raised about the Tsarnaev brothers by both officials in Moscow and Washington D.C. , why no one was tracking the movements of either of the two brothers accused of orchestrating the Boston attack . <p> " I think you do have to question why was n't he followed up ? " Raddatz said of Tamerlan Tsarnaev who was killed in a shootout with police last week . <p> " What this tells you is that you need a long-term strategy for terrorism , " Haas said . " What happened the other day in Boston @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " This is not a one-off . This was a glimpse of the future , " he continued . " This is granular terrorism that one , two , three people can carry out . We live in a world where power is diffused , where individuals are , in turn , empowered . " <p> " You do n't need to do something on the scale of 9/11 , " Haas added . " That turns out to be much less difficult for us to find out about because there are so many people involved and there 's so many traces ... " <p> New Yorker editor David Remnick agreed and added that the bombs used at the Boston Marathon were crude enough so that they resulted in fewer fatalities than they could have . <p> George Stephanopoulos asked what the response should be if it turns out that the Tsarnaev brothers had no links to an international terror network . Haas replied that it was incumbent on all Americans to engage and to not dismiss the threat posed by " lone wolf " terrorist actors . <p> A nearly identical 
 The Disease Of ' Feel-Good Limousine Liberalism ' <p> On Monday , Ben Affleck , actor , director , and producer , announced he will join a campaign to fight poverty in the Eastern Congo by living on less than a day . <p> One is n't sure whether to laugh , cry , or scream . <p> To be sure , Affleck 's pledge of living on less than will only be for the requisite five days ( after all , let 's not get crazy now ! ) and , naturally , he will still drive around one of his several luxurious cars and sleep in one of his luxurious homes , all during this five-day ' poverty ' pledge . <p> But , you ask , ' Why be so cynical , Delgado ? At least he 's doing his part to get awareness out there about this charity ! ' <p> Ahh , it 's the ' doing his part ' where I get stuck . Is Affleck truly ' doing his part ' ? How ? When ? Did I miss it ? Affleck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he and his wife , Jennifer Garner , have a combined net worth of million . <p> And yet here he is , shaking his tin can in our faces , urging us to live on for five days to benefit the Eastern Congo . <p> This , folks , is the essence of the ' feel-good limousine liberalism ' rampant today . From Bono to Oprah , from Affleck to Streisand , we are inundated with celebrities who preach selflessness and charity in public yet clutch their purse strings in private . But I understand , Ben : I know it feels euphoric to go home to your sprawling mansion and think that , with your for five days , and a quick tweet about it , you 've done your part . It 's a ridiculously tiny act that helps you sleep at night on those 600-thread-count pillows , knowing a child in Africa has no water . <p> Living in New York , I encountered such ' feel good liberals ' to an irritating degree . Millionaire friends would write a check @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the arts or such ) , attend a glamorous benefit where they get to dress up and drink ( hence getting as much out of the ' act ' as they gave ) , and pat themselves on the way home , content and satisfied they 'd done their part for humanity until next ' gala ' season . <p> Yet they and Ben have done nothing . In fact , their very wealth , whilst claiming to be concerned about the plights of the downtrodden , is a glaring contradiction . <p> Make no mistake , though : as a conservative , I have no problem with Ben Affleck hoarding his money as he does . Heck , he can roll around in a bed full of cash , ala Demi Moore in Indecent Proposal , and I 'll root him on . It 's yo ' paper , brother enjoy it . Here 's the catch , though : you ca n't have it both ways . If you are going to rake in and keep millions annually , you simply can not also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or at least temporarily ameliorated , through financial donations . <p> So Ben : How about , instead of your silly five-day pledge and your self-aggrandizing tweet , you write a big ole ' check instead ? Will it solve the problem ? Not permanently , but I can guarantee you some mouths will be fed and some lives in the Congo would be changed instantly . C'm on , is n't giving up just one of your Range Rovers worth a few kids ' lives ? You sit on millions in the bank and yet , typical limousine liberal , with a straight face you purport to care about poverty , poverty you could address in seconds with a single check . How about at least a compromise : donating a chunk of your income ( not even a majority ! ) , ala Mitt Romney 's , to this Eastern Congo endeavor ? He-llo ? Why do I hear crickets , Ben ? <p> But maybe I 'm just being a cynic . After all , even Marie Antoinette threw a scrap of old bread to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passed on the way to Versailles . And that was about as earnest and effective an act as your own five-day pledge , Ben . So never mind . Carry on and best of luck with your publicity stunt pledge .

 of the political press seem united in outrage over the recent revelations that the Internal Revenue Service targeted conservative " tea party " groups for additional tax status scrutiny during the 2012 election cycle , in what many are calling a deliberate act of political harassment . It is pleasing to see broad condemnation of what can only be interpreted as governmental abuse of power , but in order to move forward with better policy , partisans on both sides need to realize : This instance of IRS harassment is nothing new . <p> Bovard explained how President Franklin D. Roosevelt , often revered as a hero by political progressives , used the tax collecting agency to pester those who opposed his enormous expansion of the federal government under the New Deal . During his three-and-a-half terms as president , the Roosevelt IRS took swings at anti-New Deal publishers like William Randolph Hearst and political rivals like prominent Republican Andrew Mellon and radical populist Huey Long . <p> Naturally , the fun did n't end there .

" In the 1990s , Bill Clinton 's IRS was found to have audited many conservative groups that were named in a White House report on groups and individuals critical of the Democratic president . <p> During the Bush era , Rep. Walter Jones ( R-NC ) was one of the very few Republicans to call for an investigation into the fishy auditing practices of the IRS ( leaving Ron Paul aside as the obvious example , given his belief in abolishing the agency altogether ) .

Especially when the real question about the IRS will likely never get asked in Washington : <p> Why do we have this selective 501(c) tax policy in the first place ? <p> When you have a system in which bureaucrats evaluate the tax-exempt status of organizations based on easily-manipulated criteria , it 's the exact sort of policy that lends itself to the powerful playing favorites depending on political whims. <h> Global graffiti :

 somewhat obvious news is that of Americans see legal recognition of same-sex marriage as inevitable , including of marriage equality supporters , and of opponents .

It is going to come back , " declared former Vermont Gov . Howard Dean . " When you have a median home price of , people are going to go buy those houses sooner or later . " <p> " But you 've got to have a government to run the place , " Dean snuck in at the end , ruining a perfectly reasonable observation . <p> Furthermore , since Detroit 's population has fallen below 750,000 , it was not legally allowed to collect income taxes from its residents until Gov . Rick Snyder and the state ' legislature reduced that threshold to 600,000 two years ago . The city 's population hovers today around 700,000 residents . <p> " But this lack of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would impose on us even when our cities have sufficient populations , " Harris-Perry added . " Even when our communities have sufficient populations . " <p> " This is what it looks like when government is small enough to drown if your bathtub and it is not a pretty picture , " she said . <p> Please enable Javascript to watch . <p> " Detroit today employs one city worker for every 55 residents , as opposed to one city worker for every 109 residents in Charlotte , which is just barely bigger than Detroit ( the Motor City has indeed declined so much ) and one city worker for every 101 residents in El Paso , which is one spot down from Detroit on the population rankings , " wrote National Review economics Williamson ... in 2011 . <p> If you believe that the circumstances faced by Detroit 's city managers has improved in the last two years , I 've got a crime-ridden , bankrupt city for you to invest in . <p> Detroit maintains 13,000 government workers but has 22,000 government retirees burrowed into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nearly million of the city 's budget . Pensions alone already account for a quarter of city spending ; in three years , they will account for half . Pensions and city workers ' health-care subsidies account for per year from every resident of Detroit , which has a very poor population average monthly income of barely before taxes , a fifth of the population in poverty , etc . The official unemployment rate is 30 percent ; the real rate is much higher . <p> Detroit has a lot of problems . Having too small a government has never been one of them . On this topic , it would appear , Harris-Perry is either not being honest or is not properly informed of the legacy burdens Detroit 's city government must to shoulder .@@399884 <p> Residents of a 
 Rule segment on Saturday night , Bill Maher savaged the " the resurgence of the smart/stupid person , " namely , otherwise accomplished members of scientific or intellectual fields who nonetheless have the zaniest ideas when it comes to politics . <p> Maher 's first example : Eben Alexander , author of the book Proof of Heaven . He wondered " how a neurosurgeon of all people could say that he made a day trip to heaven while in a coma , when his scientific training not to mention every other scientist in the world is telling him , ' No dude , you were just tripping . Those coma drugs are good shit ' ... Hey doc , come by the show sometime , I 'll give you some bad acid and you can visit hell . " <p> But Maher saved his real vitriol for Dr. Ben Carson , a rising Republican star whose ultra-conservative beliefs which range from linking homosexuality to bestiality to believing the world is only several millennia old have been causing him some problems . <p> " There 's no more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anti-intellectual with an advanced degree , " Maher said , noting other figures like Antonin Scalia , Ted Cruz , and Bobby Jindal , " who are accomplished scholars on the outside , and on the inside a creamy layer of Michelle Bachmann . " <p> " And what 's with all the know-nothing doctors , and their sub-specialty , OB-GYNs who know nothing about reproduction ? " Maher asked . " Like Congressman OB-GYN Ron Paul who says abortion leads to euthanasia , or Congressman OB-GYN Michael Burgess , the guy who just last month said fetuses masturbate in the womb wearing tiny raincoats ! " <p> " Why are we electing so many gynecologists to Congress ? " Maher said . " If having your head between a woman 's legs is a qualification for public office , then why not Congressman Michael Douglas ? " <h> Taking some mystery

 News/Wall Street Journal poll digging into some of the fallout from the verdict in the trial of George Zimmerman found that Americans are deeply split over questions relating to racial equality . The survey found that a majority white Americans believe the United States is a colorblind society while less than 20 percent of African-Americans say the same . <p> Asked if they agree with the statement , " America is a nation where people are not judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character , " respondents in the latest NBC/WSJ poll offered widely varying responses . <p> A majority , 54 percent , of all adults said that they agree with this statement , while 45 said they did not . Among whites , 59 percent agreed with that statement to some degree while just 40 percent disagreed . 54 percent of Hispanics also agreed with this statement , while 44 percent did onto Among blacks , however , only 19 percent agreed with that statement . 79 percent of African-Americans disagreed with the statement that America society is colorblind . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blacks respond to this question . In January , 2010 , 40 percent of African-Americans agreed with the notion that America judged individuals based on character and not skin color while 58 percent disagreed .

The survey found President Barack Obama with his lowest approval rating since August , 2011 , with just 45 percent approval . <p> " The drop is explained in part by an erosion in support among African-American respondents 78 percent approve of his job , down from 88 percent in June and 93 percent in April , " Murray writes .

 Tells Him What She Really Thought Of That Twitter Pic <p> Look the royal baby is nice and all , and sure the President of the United States gave a big speech today on the economy , but we must never lose sight of what 's important : the fact that Geraldo Rivera took a topless picture of himself to share with the entire world . And lest you think he got in trouble for the borderline stunt , worry not ! His wife Erica has forgiven him . Rivera had her on his radio show on Tuesday to tell the listening audience if she was embarrassed to see her husband bare ( nearly ) all for the world . <p> She admitted she was " a little embarrassed , " but now as far as she 's concerned , " I clearly have the hottest 70-year-old husband in the world , and now the whole world knows it too .

 back and forth that erupted this week between New Jersey Gov . Chris Christie and Sen. Rand Paul ( R-KY ) has captured the media 's attention and focused the political mind on 2016 like nothing has since the night President Barack Obama won reelection . It is hard not to view the two GOP officeholders ' heated war of words in the media through the prism of the Republican presidential primaries . <p> Many conservatives have become so disillusioned with Christie , though , that they recoil at the thought of nominating him to be the party 's next presidential nominee . Paul , they reason , while not perfect , would be a preferable alternative to nominating yet another moderate destined to lose in a general election fight against ( let 's just say it , likely Democratic nominee ) former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton . While anecdotal historical evidence supports this conclusion , it ignores the specific value that Christie brings to the table . Most notably , his is the presidential candidacy that Democrats fear the most while Paul is arguably the Republican candidate Democrats would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a snapshot of today 's Republican primary electorate , you would be forgiven for thinking that Christie could never win his party 's nomination for president . According to the results of a recent Pew poll , a full 30 percent of Republicans have a negative view of the outspoken New Jersey governor stiffer opposition from his own party than Mitt Romney faced by this point in the 2012 election cycle . His willingness to compromise with his opponents and to undercut members of his own party when it suits him politically has done serious damage to his brand among conservatives . This makes Democrats very happy . <p> While some conservatives are embracing the young , vibrant , fresh-thinking , and forward-looking Paul , Democrats would much rather run against the junior senator from Kentucky than they would the governor of New Jersey . <p> By 2016 , Christie will have a record as a reformer who has twice won election statewide in a sapphire blue state . His persistently stable approval rating presently hovers around 70 percent of likely voters . In his first term , Christie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sector unions what 's more , he did not run roughshod over Democrats to accomplish these goals . He made them believe it was their idea in the first place . In contrast , GOP governors like Wisconsin 's Scott Walker or Ohio 's John Kasich attempted to enact union reforms via blunt force with varying degrees of success . Both emerged from those fights politically damaged . <p> Paul , by 2016 , will have achieved a variety of legislative accomplishments and delivered some well-received speeches during his tenure in the upper chamber of Congress . He may even sponsor a bill or two which become celebrated law a big maybe given the present occupant of the Oval Office but his accomplishments will pale in comparison to Christie 's . <p> Further , the Democratic Party can run virtually the same campaign that they ran against Romney in 2012 against Paul in 2016 , substituting the former Massachusetts governor 's personal ties to wealth with Paul 's ideological attachment to libertarianism . They will depict Paul 's as a form of " no-government conservatism " on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prosecutes the war on terror lent bipartisan legitimacy by virtue of their being utilized by both the Bush and Obama administrations could also become a net negative in a general election . Paul 's mistrust of many aspects of U.S. defense policy may win over some traditionally Democratic young voters while ceding as many adults and seniors to the Democrats . His candidacy would have the added catastrophic effect of surrendering the issue of national security to Democrats for a generation or more . <p> Christie , meanwhile , can make the issue of national defense a net benefit for his campaign . Given the likelihood that the Republican primaries are going to be dominated by libertarian-leaning insurgent candidates , Christie and the Republican Party as a whole is going to be forced to embrace a non-interventionist posture and a more reformist policy relating to domestic intelligence gathering programs than the governor might be personally comfortable with . In not going over the libertarian cliff entirely , though , he neutralizes what could be a threat to the GOP 's dominance over senior voters by ceding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Speaking of the 2012 campaign , Paul 's baggage when it comes to his past embrace of a neo-confederate speechwriter is as potentially politically toxic in a general presidential election as his father 's questionable newsletters would have been . The Democrats and Clinton can use Paul 's checkered past relating to race issues to drive up minority turnout , cement the impression that the GOP as a whole is unfriendly to minorities , and further depress the white vote . <p> About the only effective attack that the Democrats will resort to during a hypothetical general election that can mirror the 2012 campaign in terms of pitting demographic groups against one another is Christie 's ( ostensibly principled ) opposition to changing the definition of marriage to include same-sex couples . Public opinion has been trending rapidly in favor of gay marriage and , by 2016 , it is likely that Christie 's veto of a state law that would have legalized gay marriages in New Jersey will be problematic for his candidacy . <p> But how effective will Democrats ' attacks on Christie 's old fashioned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so than they would hope . Clinton has taken her share of hits from the Democratic base for embracing gay marriage rights later than anyone in the Obama administration . She came out in favor of gay marriage after Vice President Joe Biden , Obama , and even her husband , former President Bill Clinton . With few issues Democratic presidential candidates can use to cudgel Clinton during the primaries and there will be Democratic primaries in 2016 the issue of Clinton 's seemingly hesitant embrace of marriage equality will come up . <p> Will Clinton 's gay marriage troubles cancel out Christies ? No , but they will muddy the water enough to mute the efficacy of the opposition 's attacks on Christie as being a backwards-thinking bigot . <p> In private , Democrats will concede what the early polls confirm : Christie is the candidate they fear most . Their best hope is that , between now and 2016 , Republicans run Christie out of the party . Or , at least , out of the running to become their next presidential nominee . Judging by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week , Democrats just may get their wish and another eight years in the White House . <h> Outside Groups in 
 Rights drama Lee Daniels ' The a smash hit , but according to some Regal Cinemas patrons in Silver Spring , Maryland , the theater 's security for the film was a colossal bomb . A Twitter user named Tiffany that patrons of the Silver Spring Regal Cinemas had their tickets to The Butler checked twice , and were greeted in the theater by armed policemen . Managers at the theater have been directed not to comment , referring media inquiries to a phone number that 's unmanned on weekends , but Washington ABC affiliate WJLA will air a report on the story this evening . <p> Lee Daniels ' The Butler took an unexpectedly decisive victory at the box office this weekend , opening at an estimated million , well ahead of fellow new release Kick Ass 2 's million estimated gross .

 Down by 3 Oklahoma Teens ' For the Fun of It ' <p> Three Oklahoma teenagers , aged 15 , 16 and 17 , have been arrested and face the death penalty for the random killing of 22-year-old Chris Lane , an Australian attending East Central University on a baseball scholarship . <p> " He apparently was jogging , " Danny Ford , chief of the Duncan , Oklahoma Police Department , said . " He went by a residence where these three boys were , they picked him as a target , they went out and got in a vehicle and followed him . Came up from behind and basically shot him in the back with a small caliber weapon , then sped away .

 Sunday , analyst Juan Williams praised the progress of African Americans since Martin Luther King , Jr .

" You 've got to talk about the fact that of blacks are born out of wedlock I think Dr. King would cry .

 Spectrum Disorders ( ASDs ) are routinely slandered in the news media , even by parents of autistic children , but nothing comes remotely close to a CBS News report that sickly excuses the murder of 14 year-old Alex Spourdalakis by his mother and an accomplice . The report has spurred a petition to have CBS News take it down , but they really need to air a complete retraction , and discipline everyone involved in this travesty . <p> On Friday 's CBS This Morning , reporter Sharyl Attkisson delivered a report that was fatally flawed on several levels , but I hesitate to even mention the reporting itself , because even if everything in the report was above-board and true , it would not support the sick conclusion that permeates it : that Alex Spourdalakis ' mother had no choice but to murder him . This sounds like an exaggeration , surely , but it is not . This was the explicit message of CBS News ' report . <p> The closest anyone in this report comes to denouncing Alex 's murder is anchor Gayle King , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but it shines a light on the struggles of hundreds of thousands of families coping with autism . " <p> " The case is extreme , " as faint a damnation as you will ever hear for murder , is as good as it gets in this four-minute report . From there , Attkisson sets up her story by saying that Alex Spourdalakis ' murder " might be just another unexplained tragedy if it were not for a documentary following his family in the months leading up to his death . " <p> Conversely , then , Attkisson is saying that this tragedy is " explained , " a statement which , on its own , is n't necessarily outrageous , until you get to the " explanation . " It 's important , though , because it signifies the reporter 's , and CBS News ' , explicit agreement with the explanations offered in the report for Alex 's murder . It is the reason all of these people should be disciplined . <p> Attkisson calls the documentary " a rare visual prelude to murder , " and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's killer , his own mother Dorothy and his caretaker , battling a system they felt was ill equipped to help autistic children . " <p> She then plays a clip of Polly Tommey , the documentary 's producer , explaining that " Dorothy was like any other autistic mother desperately trying to get help , " and enunciating the report 's conclusion . <p> " His death did n't need to be , " Tommey says . " It was because there was n't anything in place for him . " <p> The converse of this is that , because there was supposedly not " anything in place for him , " the murder was necessary , a conclusion that is never challenged by the reporter , and indeed , endorsed by her earlier statement . <p> The report goes on to describe some of Alex 's medical and behavioral problems , bad reporting that I 'll touch on later , and then Attkisson again describes Dorothy Spourdalakis ' situation in desperate terms . " ... Dorothy could n't handle Alex while she pursued treatment . She said no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . " <p> " Dorothy 's e-mails reflected growing desperation and exhaustion , " Attkisson says , quoting one . " ' Alex has been forgotten . I did n't have a safety net so i could help him recover . ' " <p> Attkisson then describes the murder , and omits some key details . " In June , police found Alex dead at home , his mother and caretaker barely alive after they allegedly overdosed him on medicine , stabbed him in the heart , and attempted suicide . " <p> What really happened was , after a week of planning , Dorothy and Alex 's Godmother Jolanta Agatha Skrodzka overdosed Alex , took turns for hours waiting for him to die , and when he did n't , Dorothy stabbed him four times in the chest with a kitchen knife , and slashed his wrist . They then cleaned the knife and put it back in the kitchen , and took pills themselves . Dorothy wrote , of Alex 's murder , that " Alex will no longer be treated like an animal , " but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ addition to murdering Alex , " The women also allegedly killed their cat for fear he would be sent to a shelter , " according to Chicago 's ABC 7 . <p> follows her sanitized , description of Alex 's brutal hours-long murder with this quote from Dorothy 's defense attorney , Michael Botti : " Every door closed . She had nowhere to go . Nowhere to take her son . There 's no help for him . " <p> These are the " explanations " that Attkisson and CBS News have explicitly endorsed , that Dorothy Spourdalakis really had no choice but to murder her son , an evil , but a lesser evil . ( Again , this is beside the point , but the Division of Children and Family services says Dorothy was offered services , and she refused them . ) <p> But the ultimate insult , to Alex and to journalism , is how Attkisson presents the lone voice of dissent to the necessity of Alex 's murder . Neither Attkisson , nor anyone else involved in this report , ever says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the one person who does say that , Attkisson presents it as just another viewpoint , from a dude who probably has an ax to grind . " He leads a government-funded autism advocacy group , " Attkisson says , adding ( emphasis mine ) " He says lack of help is no excuse for murder . " <p> " He says . " <p> In over four minutes of reporting on how Dorothy had no choice but to murder her son , Ari Ne'eman , President of the Autistic Self Advocacy Network and the first presidential appointee with autism , is given twelve seconds to explain that " an ideology , a dangerous ideology that preaches that people are better off dead than disabled , is what led to Alex 's murder . " <p> Not for nothing , Attkisson conspicuously whitewashes her own sources ' dodgy backgrounds ( more on that later ) , but takes pains to try and smear Ari Ne'eman 's group as a " government-funded " group , when ASAN is , in fact , a private non-profit that receives some government grants . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " It 's not just Alex . a national survey found many doctors are uncertain as to what 's appropriate medical management for autistic children . Advocates hope this draws attention for the need for some change . " <p> Anchor Gayle King chimes in , at the end , " It 's a heart-breaking story , but she raises a good question . Maybe it will draw attention and help others . " <p> Please enable Javascript to watch . <p> As I said before , even if all of the factual reporting in this piece were accurate and honest , this is an unconscionable travesty . This report explicitly says that , while Alex 's murder is " extreme , " and maybe even " heart-breaking " ( although it 's unclear if the heartbreak is at Alex 's murder , or poor Saint Dorothy 's ordeal ) , what else was she supposed to do , and maybe this story will help keep other autism parents from being forced to murder their children . It is sick , and very tangibly dangerous . I asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Here 's what he had to say , via email : <p> " For years now , disabled activists have been working to fight back against the media presenting the killing of disabled people as understandable and our murderers as sympathetic victims . Unfortunately , CBS chose to perpetrate some of the most harmful tropes justifying the murder of disabled people in their recent segment . <p> The reality is that the Alex Spourdalakis case , like similar ones , was not about lack of support . On multiple occasions , Alex 's mother turned down access to services , turning instead to the psuedo-science peddled by discredited former physician Andrew Wakefield and others . What killed Alex Spourdalakis was an ideology that preaches that disabled people only have two viable options cure or death . CBS chose the wrong side of that fight . " <p> There are millions of parents who care for disabled children , and do not murder them , but Ari is correct , there is a strong strain of martyrdom among some in the autism community for whom the main problem is how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people with autism . It takes just one of them sees this report , and decides that their suffering should also be ended by murdering their child , with the side benefit of drawing attention to how the world forces people to kill their own children . <p> I do n't want to go too far down the rabbit hole of Attkisson 's awful reporting , because I do n't want to distract from the main issue that there is no excuse for murder , but I will offer just two egregious examples . If you 're really interested in how far the rot goes , you can read more about it here . <p> Here is the first egregious , fatal omission by Sharyl Attkisson . Remember this guy from the report , described as " a gastric specialist in New York ? " <p> Arthur Krigsman , MD , is a pediatrician and gastroenterologist best known for his controversial and widely criticized research in which he attempted to prove that the MMR vaccine caused diseases , especially autism . He specializes in the evaluation and treatment of gastrointestinal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ written in support of the controversial entity of autistic enterocolitis . The original study that tied the MMR vaccine to autism and GI complaints conducted by one of Krigsman 's colleagues has been found to be fraudulent , and the diagnosis of " autistic enterocolitis " has never been widely accepted in the medical community . <p> Dr. Krigsman is part of the quack anti-vaccine movement , as is the documentarian , Polly Tommey . When Attkisson says that " no other facility would keep " Alex , and that " insurance would n't pay " for Alex 's treatment , she 's using journalistic sleight-of-hand , because she never explains what treatment she 's referring to . Most reputable facilities and insurance companies wo n't sign off on medically unproven treatments . <p> There is every reason to believe , though , that there was a place for Alex , away from his murderous caretakers . In May , Polly Tommey 's group posted a YouTube video from Alex 's bedside , in which a man named Andy Wakefield says that Alex " is destined , in the next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in an institution , in the absence of his mother and his godmother , without whom it 's going to be a very , very frightening experience , " and pleads with viewers to prevent this . Now , I do n't know a thing about Alex 's specific condition , or what diagnoses were being considered for long-term care , but whatever they were , that prospect was surely less frightening than being slowly poisoned and stabbed to death . Again , this is an inexcusable omission on Attkisson 's part , as this video was publicly posted by her own primary source . <p> Based on these omissions alone , there is no reason to believe anything that Attkisson reports about the lack of help available to Dorothy Spourdalakis , which is irrelevant anyway , because you still do n't get to murder your child . If CBS News agrees that there are choices preferable to murder , they need to send that message by completely , conspicuously retracting this report . This is journalistic harm at its most egregious , and there are n't enough autism parents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right thing . It will take an act of conscience . The media was outraged when an anonymous letter-writer encouraged the euthanization of an autistic child .

Over Labor Day weekend , three hunting parties caught three separate alligators , two of which were over 700 pounds and set records for captured gators . <p> The first gator was caught byMichael and Bethany Piper last Friday , and it took them quite a while to catch it . <p> Around 11:45 p.m. on Friday they hooked it with a fishing pole just south of the I-10 long bridge in Pascagoula ... <p> Michael Piper said they had to ask boaters nearby to help and at 2 a.m . Saturday the 11 ' 5 ?

Beth Trammell led a hunting party near Redwood , Mississippi , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , four whole hours , to get the gator in the boat . Their gator weighed 723.5 pounds , and held the record for largest alligator caught for about an hour , before another gator took the mantle from them . <p> Dustin Brockman of Vicksburg , Miss. , ventured with his brother and friend into the Mississippi River by motorboat early Saturday night and emerged with a 727-pound record breaker that was 13 feet , 4.5 inches long ... <p> Brockman said that it took two hours after hooking the alligator using a crossbow before they could shoot it with a shotgun . It took four hours more to get it into the boat , but Brockman said it was too heavy to do with just the three of them , so they just waited in the middle of the river for the sun to rise . <p> " We killed the alligator at 4 a.m. , " he said . " We waited until 6:30 ( a.m. ) before I called three or four more guys to help us load it into the boat .

 One Last Epic Annihilation of Anthony Weiner <p> Jon Stewart has a long history with Anthony Weiner . Their decades-old friendship has always made it a bit awkward when Weiner does something so stupid that Stewart has no choice but to brutally mock him on The Daily Show . With the New York Mayoral Primary just days away , Stewart took the opportunity to produce one ( presumably ) final take down of Weiner , who may have finally hit rock bottom . <p> Stewart began by looking more broadly at the New York race , and the end of the Michael Bloomberg era . He showed some clips of embarrassing questions from the final Democratic debate this week , but struggled to make jokes about the more competent candidates so quickly moved on to Weiner . <p> On Weiner 's answer to the question about how often he has a housekeeper at his house , Stewart said , " there 's that charm that borders on the edge of dickish-ness . " Showing Weiner 's infamous " selfie " pic , he framed Weiner 's campaign as one that was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' redemption and forgiveness , but now it is somewhat noticeably curved a bit to the right away from that premise . " <p> John Oliver may have had fun with Weiner this summer , but it was nothing compared to what came next as Stewart ran through some of the mayoral candidate 's greatest pandering hits with help from Jessica Williams , Aasif Mandvi and Al Madrigal . Finally , he landed on the confrontation with a Jewish voter than may just have been the final nail in campaign 's coffin . <p> When Stewart discovered that Weiner was actually arguing with the man because he had made a crude comment about his wife , Huma Abedin , the host had a revelation . " What if everything Anthony Weiner has done actually makes sense if you look at it a larger context ? " he wondered . " What if there for each of these incidents , one piece of information that makes each incident okay ? " <p> After testing out his theory , Stewart concluded , " Nah , he 's just a guy with self-control @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @@@497210 <p> " He 's 
 the negative , nasty , unbelievable things Anthony Weiner has ever done . Does " a pathological need to be in public politics " enter the top ten ? No ? Well , good thing you 're not Lawrence O'Donnell then , because that was the first and ONLY issue he took with Weiner in an interview Monday . There are no words that can do this mess justice , only to say that for the first time since the first picture of his penis emerged on the internet ... you may end up feeling bad for Anthony Weiner . <p> O'Donnell opened the interview with a penetrating question : " What is wrong with you ? " <p> He elaborated , but it did n't sound any better . <p> " What is wrong with you that you can not seem to imagine a life without elected office ? " <p> See , O'Donnell did n't dwell on the sexting and the lying , he was more interested in Weiner somehow having this kind of pathological need to stay in elected office , which I do n't think is necessarily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Congress is any indication ) . Weiner got a bit snarky with O'Donnell , while O'Donnell kept going on and on about what the hell is wrong with him , going so far as to say Weiner might have some personal " demons " keeping him in politics . <p> ( Sidenote : this interview just further confirmed my theory that O'Donnell is basically the real-world version of Will McAvoy . ) <p> And AMAZINGLY , Weiner actually stayed for an eight extra minutes on the web , taking great glee in mocking O'Donnell for his obsessive need ; namely , being on television four nights a week . O'Donnell , seemingly stuck on this one issue like a toddler who keeps incessantly asking you WHY WHY WHY WHY WHY , kept pressing Weiner on what exactly is wrong with him . <p> What 's absolutely galling about this whole mess is that O'Donnell seems to think Weiner 's ... IS N'T REALLY THAT BIG OF A DEAL . And when Weiner says that just shouting at him " What 's wrong with you ? " is n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! <p> As bad as Weiner 's swagger gets at times , it really ca n't match the dripping nay , drooling condescension pouring from O'Donnell 's lips . <p> Watch below , via MSNBC , and I DEFY you not to feel just the tiniest pinprick of sympathy for Anthony Weiner : <p> ANTWERP , Belgium 
 ( and , for some reason , Breitbart.com ) have been all aflutter over Diana star Naomi Watts ' baffling walkout during an interview with BBC Radio 's Simon Mayo several weeks ago . In the short clip that has been circulated , Watts abruptly tells Mayo that " I think we 're getting the wind-up , sorry , " and ends the interview above Mayo 's protests , even though Mayo confirms there was no one else in the room with Watts other than Mayo 's sound man . The full interview has now been released , and sheds some light on Watts ' sudden exit . The interview was to support Watts ' starring turn in Diana , the Princes Diana biopic that 's scheduled for U.S. release November 1 . <p> In this shorter version , you can hear that there 's nothing particularly controversial or objectionable being discussed when Watts suddenly says she 's being told to " wind it up . " <p> " Okay , we were given ten minutes , and we 've had eight and a half , which is why we 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh , " a Hannibal Watts says , " well , I think we 're running late , and we 've got to go to the next thing . " <p> " Could we perhaps finish the interview properly , as we started it ? Otherwise , we ca n't use the interview , " Mayo pleads dejectedly , to no avail . The entire episode has the surreal quality of a Jerry Springer brawl on Valium and crumpets . <p> Please enable Javascript to watch . <p> Mayo , as you can hear , is properly baffled at the whole thing , unable to figure out what sent Watts into the British equivalent of a berserking rage . Perhaps a review of the entire interview , which Mayo has just released , will contain clues . Pay particularly close attention to the first seven minutes and fifty seconds of the interview , by which time Mayo has broached the difficult topic of location clearances : <p> There are a few possibilities , the most likely of which is that Watts hung in there for eight and a half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before I had to start skipping ahead . I honestly still have no idea what was said during most of it , and probably never will , because I have what 's called a normal human sleep response . Watts , as a proper Brit , could n't just say " Simon , you 're boring the tits off me , " so she concocted an impatient publicist to spare him . <p> The other possibility is that " we 've got to go to the next thing " was polite code for some other bit of ... shall we say , urgent business , that Watts did n't think Mayo 's audience needed to hear about . <h> Share <p> Undocumented 
 Lemon has , of late , turned the focus of his frequent conversations on race to the idea of personal responsibility in the African American community . On Saturday night 's edition of CNN Newsroom , Lemon continued that controversial trend with comic legend Bill Cosby , who has also felt the heat of controversy on the subject . Cosby talked to Lemon about young black men raising their kids , over-medication of juvenile inmates , and may have even coined a new word : " . " <p> For the past few months , Don Lemon has courted controversy with several segments pegged to his general agreement with comments by Fox News O'Reilly , aimed at solving problems within the black community . Legendary comic actor Bill Cosby has also stirred controversy by airing grievances against his community , but neither Lemon nor Cosby have backed away from their criticisms . In Saturday night 's interview , Lemon asked Cosby to reflect on the 50th anniversary of the March on Washington , and what kind of African American leaders are needed now . <p> " I think it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began . " I think , women , strongly because when you see , in research , that says they are the leaders of the household , what we need is for people to realize I want to raise my kid . I want to go back and get my three kids . I want to take on that responsibility . I want to love my children . " <p> He added that one of the sights he 'd like to see more of is what he saw at the recent Essence Festival , " walking around to see , yeah , to see a black male with his child on the shoulders and holding . " <p> He also encouraged young people who might not be able to go to a prestigious college to " go to community college . Okay , you backed up and did n't do well . You quit school but now you find you need that high school credential . Go to the community college . " <p> Cosby related the idea of personal responsibility to his own experience , adding that " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't want to do certain things . It is not what they were n't doing to me , it 's what I was n't doing . It 's a very simple thing . " <p> Later in the interview , Mr. Cosby talked about what he sees as an overemphasis on medicating juvenile inmates , versus counseling . " If you drug these people , and then you release them , and there 's no prescription for them to get to take to do the same thing , and they go back to the same place , " he said , adding " Now , about this time , this is when you hear the jump up and say ' Why do n't you talk about the good things ? ' " <p> " Because the good things happen to be taking care of themselves pretty well , " he answered . " We are trying to help those genius ' , those not genius ' , people who deserve , because they are human beings on this earth , in the United States of America , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will understand and want to . " <p> Lemon asked " Why is it so hard for some people to get that message , to hear that message , to receive that message , and without lashing out ? " <p> " Well , it 's because they feel , I think they feel embarrassed , " Cosby replied , and related a story about Sammy Davis , Jr . " We were in playing in a routine , and I told him I knew something . He said no you do n't . I said yes , I do . I said it . He said no , that 's not the way it goes . I said the same thing louder . He said , ' Bill , saying it loud do n't make it right . ' " <p> " And so , every loud voice you hear yelling about something , " he explained , " and saying ' Well you just you lost us .

 of an ongoing mass shooting at the Washington Naval Yard , CNN anchor Carol Costello quizzed a producer on the scene about whether a military base like this has ever come under attack by a gunman before .

 Weekend Update Anchor : Best of Cecily Strong on SNL <p> Saturday Night Live starts its 39th season tomorrow night and it 's going to be a major transition year for the show .

 Traces of Russell Brand After His Nazi Joke <p> GQ magazine was apparently so displeased with comedian Russell Brand 's recent Nazi-related joke about the Hugo Boss fashion company that they erased all traces of him from their online and print " Man of the Year " issue . <p> In a tweet this week , Brand accused the men 's magazine of cleansing itself entirely of his image : <p> GQ cleansed me from their issue . That 's what they do when they do n't like something . I guess that 's why they dig the Nazis . <p> ( Before you continue , keep in mind that the fashion company Hugo Boss paid ? 250,000 to sponsor the dinner event . Hugo Boss is also the same company that ( at the time ) proudly supplied uniforms for the Nazi regime . So , yeah . ) <p> After London mayor Boris Johnson accepted a prior award and used the podium to rail against pro-Syrian intervention factions in the UK government , Brand took to the mound and delivered this doozy of speech : <p> " Also glad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the use of chemical weapons in Syria , meaning that GQ can now stand for ' Genocide Quips . ' I mention that only to make this next comment a bit lighter . ' Cause if any of you know a little bit about history and fashion , you 'll know that Hugo Boss made the uniforms for the Nazis . And the Nazis did have flaws . But they did look fucking fantastic , let 's face it , while they were killing people on the basis of their religion and sexuality . " <p> Welp . Naturally , Brand was kicked out of the award ceremony 's after-party and , as we know now , removed from the magazine entirely . He humorously recounted his confrontation with GQ brass as such : <p> GQ editor : " What you did was very offensive to Hugo Boss . " Me : " What Hugo Boss did was very offensive to the Jews .

Perhaps Hugo Boss threatened to pull advertising money ? He 's also been omitted from the web winners ' slideshow . <p> Though GQ has avoided commenting on the matter , Hugo Boss responded by pointing out that the British actor wore a Hugo Boss jacket to an Oscar party in February . Brand himself explained the joke to the Guardian : <p> " The jokes about Hugo Boss were not intended to herald a campaign to destroy them .

 impromptu press conference , White House Press Secretary Jay Carney gave President Obama a list of reporters to call on that did not include a single television reporter . During Friday afternoon 's late-starting daily briefing , Carney went deep into the briefing without calling on Fox News ' Ed Henry , and ignored Henry 's attempts to ask a question until Henry finally gave up , walking out of the briefing 's final minutes . <p> Carney 's snub of TV reporters Wednesday followed recent sharp exchanges with some TV reporters , particularly Ed Henry , whom Carney repeatedly posed as a partisan opponent .

 Fox News ' James Rosen of ' Creating an Exchange for Fox ' on Benghazi <p> Fox News National Security Correspondent James Rosen put in an appearance at Thursday 's White House Daily Briefing to engage Press Secretary Jay Carney on the topic of Republican Congressional investigations into Benghazi . Carney , who has been increasingly eager to call out what he sees as partisan questioning , accused Rosen of " creating an exchange for Fox , " to which Rosen shot back " what we are engaged in here is for the record , not for Fox . " <p> Rosen , who was the subject of Justice Department subpoenas in the leak investigation into then-State Department contractor Stephen Jin-Woo Kim , is not a regular at White House briefings , but joined Ed Henry Thursday in order to question Carney about Benghazi . The nearly ten-minute exchange ended with a persistent Rosen being told " I think we 're done here , James " by Carney as he exited the briefing room . <p> While Rosen is correct that everything in the White House briefings is " for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that if the point was simply to get Carney on the record , Ed Henry could as easily have asked the same questions . It 's also true , though , that most TV reporters ' questions are at least partially for the purpose of creating clips for use in news programming , which is why you 'll often hear very similar questions asked five or six times at each briefing . All of these exchanges are " created " for some TV network . <p> However , Carney 's broader point appears to be that the issue of Congressional investigations into Benghazi has been covered by Fox News in much greater proportion than other outlets , and that Rosen 's line of questioning was tailored to that editorial sensibility , and to that audience . <p> Here 's the exchange , via C-Span : <p> Please enable Javascript to watch . <p> Here 's a transcript of the exchange , via email from The White House : <p> MR . CARNEY : James . <p> Q Jay , thanks very much . I wanted to ask about a completely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Investigations , as you may know , last week held its ninth hearing on the subject of Benghazi . Seven of them have been classified , as was last week 's , where the witness was the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , General Dempsey . I know that you have covered the particular subject matter before in this briefing room , but it has resurfaced in a fresh context as receiving fresh scrutiny from these House Armed Services Committee investigators , and therefore I thought it fair to give you another chance to address it . They accept the White House 's conclusion that no military rescue or response could possibly have been achieved in Benghazi that night because the posturing of U.S. military assets around the world was so poor on that night . And this has led them <p> MR . CARNEY : That 's the statement of a House Republican subcommittee chairman , correct ? <p> Q Well , that is their conclusion . And this has led them to refocus their attention on a press release that your office issued on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was very brief , it was four sentences . But it essentially stated that the President on that day , September 10 , 2011 , had met with key national security principals to assure that as the eve of the 11th anniversary of 9/11 approached , steps were being taken to assure the protection of U.S. personnel and assets . It alluded further to meetings that John Brennan at that time had held . <p> The House investigators have determined that General Carter Harm , the combatant commander with jurisdiction over Libya , was not consulted as part of those sessions . I wonder if you could tell us more about what those meetings entailed , who the participants were , how closely vetted that or thoroughly vetted that press release was , and whether the White House might be willing to make available either to congressional investigators and/or to the public the emails , the memos and other sort of paperwork that was associated with the development of that press release . <p> MR . CARNEY : James , the President of the United States , as did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ team , principals of that team , on the eve of the anniversary of 9/11 on the actions that were being taken both here in the homeland and around the world in preparation for potential threats . <p> If your question is , was the preparation for or was there adequate security at the diplomatic facility in Benghazi to protect the Americans there , the answer is categorically no , as the President said after the attack in Benghazi which is why he said he would make sure that his administration did everything it could to bring those to justice who killed four Americans . And he endorsed the effort undertaken by former Secretary Clinton to set up an independent Accountability Review Board to investigate the situation both before , during , and after the Benghazi attacks , with a particular focus on the question of security . And they found problems with security and made a series of recommendations that Secretary Clinton and her successor , Secretary Kerry , have addressed in full every single one of them . <p> So I 'm not sure I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think I probably also discussed here , as I think my predecessors of both administrations have done , which is that because of the nature of the anniversary , there are preparations made in anticipation of potential threats , but it is clear because four Americans died on that day that there was not adequate security . And that was revealed in the Accountability Review Board . It was revealed in the testimony at 13 congressional hearings that this administration has participated in , with 40 staff briefings and 25,000 pages of documents . <p> Efforts by that committee that you mention I believe it 's that committee to denigrate the credibility of the Accountability Review Board were rejected quite powerfully by the independent inspector general who said that there were no signs of bias in the Accountability Review Board a board which , by the way , was headed up by former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs Admiral Mullen and one of the most admired diplomats who served Presidents of both parties , Ambassador Pickering . <p> The President remains committed to ensuring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an administration and with Congress to enhance the security of our personnel serving overseas , recognizing that by serving their country they of course are in some places and in some cases putting themselves at risk . He is committed to doing everything that we can as a country and a government to bring to justice those who are responsible for the deaths of for Americans . And those are the issues that he believes are most important . <p> Q Your reply to me focused on the work of the ARB , which , as a statutory issue , does not have jurisdiction over military posture and deployment . And your answer to me also emphasized the question of security at the consulate itself . But the piece of Benghazi over which the House Armed Services Subcommittee that I 'm talking about does have jurisdiction is not with respect to the ARB 's work or with respect to the DS facilities onsite at Benghazi . It is with respect to the posturing of the military in a volatile time around the world , which as we now know from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remedy impossible <p> <p> MR . CARNEY : The core statement is a reflection of an assessment made by Republicans who have , as you know , attempted , unfortunately , to make this a partisan issue . <p> Q Allow me to finish the question . <p> MR . CARNEY : And I would simply say when it comes to and I know that we 're creating an exchange here for FOX , and I 'm mindful of that . But allow me to suggest that questions about the posturing of defense forces are usually better addressed at the Pentagon . <p> Q My question to you , Jay , is first of all , what we 're engaged in here is not for FOX . It 's for the record . And the fact that the posturing was such that it made remedy or rescue in that situation impossible is not a conclusion solely of the House Armed Services Committee or of Republicans , it 's a self-evident fact . So all I 'm trying to ask you is , with respect to these meetings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day before those attacks , how is it possible that you can maintain that adequate steps were taken , vis- ? -vis force posture , by the Commander-in-Chief and his aides , when in fact the posture is now universally acknowledged to have been such that it made remedy or rescue impossible ? <p> MR . CARNEY : Again , James , I think I said very clearly that there was not adequate security to protect those four Americans . And the President has been absolutely clear and forthright about that , as have the numerous investigators who have looked into this , including , of course , the Accountability Review Board . <p> I think when it comes to how the U.S. military positions its assets , again , that is a question best answered by the Department of Defense and by commanders . But you get no argument here from the suggestion that there was not adequate security there . That is self-evident , as you said . And the administration 's cooperation with investigations here has been exhaustive . It includes , obviously , the full cooperation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unfortunately , despite the stature and independence of those who were in charge of it , been questioned by partisans on Capitol Hill . <p> And I think that this reflects , unfortunately , the kind of partisan gamesmanship that so frustrates the American people when we need to be focused on making sure that adequate security is provided at our diplomatic facilities around the world so that our personnel serving abroad are protected ; making sure that the intelligence and resources that we can apply are being applied to bring to justice those who are responsible for the deaths of four Americans ; and making sure that we continue to provide the resources necessary to our military , and the rest of our national security apparatus , to allow it to keep us safe . And that 's what this President is committed , to and that 's reflected in everything he does and says about this issue . <p> Q Will he be willing to make any of those documents associated with that press release available , as you did with the Susan Rice talking points ?@@587587 <h> Africa in Focus

A documentary video uncovers the truth behind Chinese cooking " gutter oil " which , along with a variety of animal products , is essentially sewage . <p> The video , produced by Radio Free Asia , features a woman using a sieve to rescue some unidentifiable slop from a sewer which is then converted into oil for cooking . <p> The narrator revealed that one tenth of Chinese cooking oil is estimated to be " gutter oil " which has been found to contain carcinogens and " other toxins .

 Ca n't Get Enough Sebelius Wizard of Oz Jokes <p> Secretary of Health and Human Services Kathleen Sebelius was not in Kansas anymore when she testified before the House Energy and Commerce Committee in Wednesday . No , the former governor of Kansas was in Washington , D.C. , where members of both political parties spent an inordinate amount of time making jokes about and references to The Wizard of Oz . <p> Rep.

By the time in was Kansas Republican Mike Pompeo 's turn to speak , most of the good comments about Yellow Brick Roads and mysterious men hiding behind curtains had been taken .

 Year of Poor Decisions Show Why It 's Time for a Change of Leadership at MSNBC <p> This column is not about MSNBC 's narrative ... not about its ideology or advocacy . The decision by MSNBC a few years ago to go left , to be the anti-Fox , should be applauded , as it boosted what used to be anemic ratings ( averaging about 350,000 viewers in primetime ) . <p> Believe it or not , MSNBC used to be down the middle : Imus , Tucker Carlson , Michael Savage and Joe Scarborough once all had their own shows , for example . But it simply was n't working . The network just did n't have an identity . <p> Then along came the rise of Olbermann and then Maddow , who both were aided by a decision by then NBCU CEO Jeff Zucker and MSNBC President Phil Griffin ( following Olbermann 's lead ) to create a more opinion-based platform . From there , the additions of Al Sharpton , http : **37;0;TOOLONG ? " &gt;Lawrence O'Donnell , Chris Hayes , and Ed Schultz ( along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Joe was created ( to replace Imus ) , and the rest is cable news history . And while MSNBC is still getting beaten by Fox News by 3-1 , even 4-1 margins , it 's a significant improvement from where the network once was . <p> So with momentum at his back following the re-election of President Obama , Griffin felt he had the gravitas and instincts to make some bold pronouncements and even more on-air talent hires . <p> Unfortunately , every single one ( particularly since Zucker left ) has been ill-advised and ill-considered , respectively . <p> So as the headline indicates , there needs to be a change at MSNBC . But not to its liberal presentation ... that is n't at issue . Instead , it 's time for Comcast to politely show Mr. Griffin the door for several other reasons , including : <p> " The Declaration " <p> Griffin told The New Republic in March he expected to beat Fox by the end of the calendar year . An odd declaration given it 's a non-election year ( when breaking news/human interest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lack of a big-time progressive star ( say , Jon Stewart or Bill Maher ) being signed by the network . Instead , Griffin misread the tea leaves of higher ratings leading up to the 2012 election and thought the audience would remain loyal to MSNBC personalities . <p> Turns out they loved the storyline of Obama vs . Romney . <p> The storytellers ? Not so much ... <p> So instead of jumping to 1st place , the network fell to 4th during the George Zimmerman trial . Which led to the next reckless declaration by Griffin : <p> " We 're not the place " for breaking news . " Our brand is not that . " <p> When asked why his ratings were tanking in June , Griffin punted on a major aspect of being , you know , a cable news station . By stating publicly that his network is n't terribly interested in breaking news stories where the biggest ratings can often come from he essentially turned MSNBC into the Olympic games ( which occur once every two years ) . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ natural disasters like Hurricane Sandy or the Oklahoma tornadoes ... or human interest stories like the Cleveland kidnappings ? Griffin inexplicably says do n't even bother coming to MSNBC unless politics are at the forefront . <p> MSNBC itself may not have a Shepard Smith or Anderson Cooper , but it does have the NBC News mothership and all the assets that come with it . For Griffin to punt on breaking news despite having network resources at his disposal for huge events was in itself a reason for termination alone . <p> Moving Chris Hayes to 8:00 PM and Ed Schultz to weekends and again back to weekdays . <p> Mr. Hayes is an intelligent guy . His weekend morning show before moving to primetime was wonky , thoughtful and perfect for that timeslot . But moving him to primetime absolutely the wrong place and time for his kind of show and personality has resulted in the opposite of a rising tide lifting all boats . Keith Olbermann averaged 1.2 million viewers when he fired in 2011 . Hayes has been averaging half that since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ timeslot . Maddow 's and O'Donnell 's numbers have noticeably suffered as a result . <p> As for Schultz , the curious move from 8:00 PM weekdays to 5:00 PM on weekends ( for a few months ) only to bring him back to weekdays ( this time at 5:00 PM ) illustrates little long-term thinking . And with every move , every change , it damages the Schultz brand . Is he on in primetime this week , late afternoon , weekdays , weekends ? Is he part of the network 's political coverage on election night ? Does the network have confidence in him ? These are all bad questions , and Comcast and Schultz have only Griffin to blame . <p> Hiring Alec Baldwin <p> If Baldwin did a show that actually featured guests who 98 percent of the audience actually recognizes ( See : De Blasio , Gary Lockwood , Keir Dullea , Cristina Tzintzun , and Mary Brosnahan in the first five weeks of the show alone ) , it might be succeeding . But the tedious hour has instead produced ratings that have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prison documentaries ( Lockup ) , which once occupied the slot . Then there 's the cost of signing Baldwin , hiring producers , writers , other resources ... with little return on investment . <p> This , of course , does n't even include the PR nightmare Baldwin predictably brought with him to MSNBC . The actor 's public meltdowns were well-known to Griffin , but he went ahead and signed the 55-year-old anyway . Even worse , he 's allowed Baldwin to dictate the kind of show Up Late would become : One that did n't leverage Baldwin 's star power , but appeased his ego instead by doing a niche program that belongs on local New York radio , not on a national stage . <p> Baldwin has been suspended for two weeks for his latest blowup , which was prompted by the host using the colorful combination of " and f*g being directed at a photographer in Manhattan . But who handed down the suspension ? That 's only a mystery because Baldwin made the announcement himself , which is patently odd . Who allows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Huffington Post , no less ? Griffin is nowhere to be found on this story , which only proves he has little control over his talent , especially considering ... <p> And it 's not as he 's killing it in the ratings . Day after day , Bashir easily owns the lowest-rated show in his timeslot among the big three . If Griffin were smart , he 'd use this episode as an excuse to get rid of Bashir . But as of this writing ( Sunday evening ) , nothing has been said or done . No suspensions have been handed down . Maybe Bashir will announce his punishment in Politico ... <p> Is Griffin simply afraid to confront his hosts , or is he more interested in any kind of publicity , good or bad , integrity be damned ? <p> In 2014 , things will be better for MSNBC . Elections and all the hype leading up to them are what the network does well , and the midterms will certainly help the self-described place for politics . <p> Phil Griffin should be commended for helping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that once had no identity is officially a unique brand . <p> But 2013 shows that it 's time for the next step at 30 Rock ... virtue of a lack of leadership , communication , collaboration , vision and sound decision-making . <h> After decades of 
 came after a prolonged , unexplained Schulz absence from the show . <p> " A lot of viewers have wondered where the heck Bill Schulz went , " Gutfeld said . " Sad to say he has decided to move on from the show . He 's been a close friend of mine for 13 years , and he 's been a huge part of Red Eye since its inception , and we wish him the best . " <p> No further reason was given for his departure . <p> Schulz had been with Red Eye from its inception on February 5 , 2007 , until this departure , often serving as the butt end of the show 's running gags and foil to host Gutfeld . <p> UPDATE : Mediaite received the following comment from the network , via a Fox News spokesperson : <p> It 's getting 
 's The Rachel Maddow Show , the story of how Rick Santorum and wife Karen dealt with the loss of their newborn son Gabriel again became fodder for criticism of Santorum 's presidential prospects . Although he handled it in a marginally more delicate fashion than Alan Colmes did ( for which he apologized ) , MSNBC contributor Eugene Robinson cited the incident as a " weird story " that might put off some Republican voters . <p> Host Rachel Maddow began the segment ( you can watch the whole thing here ) by detailing many of the questionable things that have yet to become the focus of Santorum coverage , including his involvement in the John Ensign scandal , and wondered if Santorum would be subjected to the same media vetting as the previous 73 GOP frontrunners from this year . Maddow then brought Robinson on , and asked him if any of his extreme social positions ( banning contraception , banning abortion even in cases of rape and incest ) might " hurt him among Republicans ? " <p> Referencing an earlier clip from Greta Van Susteren 's On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrong . He 's not a little weird . He 's really weird . " <p> " Some of his positions he 's taken are just so weird , " he continued , " that I think some Republicans are going to be off-put . Not everybody is going to be down , for example , with the story of how he and his wife handled the stillborn child whose body they took home to kind of sleep with and introduce to the rest of the family . It 's a very weird story . " <p> To clarify , the Santorum 's baby was not " stillborn , " but rather , died two hours after being born . Here 's what happened : <p> The childbirth in 1996 was a source of terrible heartbreak the couple were told by doctors early in the pregnancy that the baby Karen was carrying had a fatal defect and would survive only for a short time outside the womb . According to Karen Santorum 's book , " Letters to Gabriel : The True Story of Gabriel Michael Santorum , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that reached nearly 105 degrees . She went into labor when she was 20 weeks pregnant . After resisting at first , she allowed doctors to give her the drug Pitocin to speed the birth . Gabriel lived just two hours . <p> What happened after the death is a kind of snapshot of a cultural divide . Some would find it discomforting , strange , even ghoulish others brave and deeply spiritual . Rick and Karen Santorum would not let the morgue take the corpse of their newborn ; they slept that night in the hospital with their lifeless baby between them . The next day , they took him home . " Your siblings could not have been more excited about you ! " Karen writes in the book , which takes the form of letters to Gabriel , mostly while he is in utero . " Elizabeth and Johnny held you with so much love and tenderness . Elizabeth proudly announced to everyone as she cuddled you , ' This is my baby brother , Gabriel ; he is an angel . ' " <p> As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ publicized the event means that , to some extent , it is an appropriate subject for public discussion . For example , the notion that Gabriel 's story is relevant to the abortion rights debate is something that can be legitimately challenged , but even then , it should be handled in a delicate , respectful manner . I have heard liberals mock the Santorums ' expression of grief cruelly in the past , and while Eugene Robinson was n't necessarily cruel , there 's something seriously wrong with his premise . <p> While the Santorums ' actions were certainly different , to call them " weird " is to act as if there are ways of dealing with the dead that are n't weird . We sew their eyes and lips shut , pump them full of chemicals , out them into elaborate boxes that we 'll never see again , and sometimes build little stone houses to keep them in . <p> I 'm not a particularly religious person ( you could call me agnostic ) , but when my father died , I stayed with his body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talking to him , holding him , and even freaking out a little every time he twitched , convinced the doctors might have screwed it up . After he was cremated , my brother and I scattered his ashes at Sandy Hook , and the wind there absolutely coated me , Big Lebowski-style , in his ashes . It was comical and horrifying , and it would n't be a stretch to call it " weird . " <p> In Rick Santorum 's case , his family was dealing with a gut-wrenching tragedy , and along with it , a heart-rending decision . They do n't deserve to be judged as " weird " for their actions here any more than anyone else . By the same token , Santorum probably should n't judge others who are making gut-wrenching decisions , like whether to carry a child after a rape , or when a late-term complication could leave a mother 's other children orphaned , or even whether they can marry the person they love . @ @ @ @ TV 
 pick his favorite means of artistic expression , David Cross selected stand-up comedy . As opposed to other comedy , he said that stand-up comedy was his own true voice without his ideas having to be filtered through anything . That 's what the assembled crowd was privy to in his talk with New York Times reporter ( and , clearly , big fan ) Dave Itzkoff . Cross , while taking the audience on a tour of his career , was affable and hilarious , answering each question with a joke before actually addressing it . <p> Cross discussed his involvement in the " alt comedy scene " a label he says he has grown to accept in Boston , his writing jobs from The Ben Stiller Show ( he said the The Legend of P.J. O'Pootertoot was the only sketch he could claim as his own ) through Mr. Show with Bob and David and The Increasingly Poor Decisions of Todd Margaret , and his acting career , spending the most time on Arrested Development . <p> Cross was quick to denigrate many of his own credits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of one-off roles or guest starring , and that many of his movies are done for paychecks . At the same time , he wildly adores the projects he loves . He described writing with Bob Odenkirk on Mr. Show as " effortless " and said that he realized immediately that Arrested Development was special , and the entire cast appreciated it as it was happening . <p> What They Said " It is a genius idea ... It is so good . Awesome idea . Can not wait . " David Cross is as into the Arrested Development as the rest of the internet , but also will offer as many details as the rest of the internet will <p> " I do n't think he 's a pathological liar ... he 's an infuriating fool ... he 's dumb but he means well . " David Cross has a charitable view of Todd Margaret <p> " I moved to L.A. to make enough money to move away from L.A. " David Cross enjoys going on stand-up tours <p> " I 'm just dying to know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cross on why he is " rooting " for Work It to succeed <p> What We Thought <p> The penultimate audience question was asked by a well-built tattooed man in a ski hat who told David Cross that , in 2004 , he had used his apartment for a shoot , peed with the door open , farted audibly and insulted his vegetables ( " Why buy new vegetables when your old vegetables could just grow new vegetables ? " ) . He then followed it up with " Is that your general attitude ? Does it ever get you in trouble ? " It was a hilarious anecdote , perfectly said , all while at the same time being slightly and vaguely threatening . Cross handled it well and the audience loved every moment . <p> David Cross said that writing Will Arnett 's outrageous character in The Increasingly Poor Decisions of Todd Margaret is the most fun he has ever had writing for any character . Some of the things they 'd have Arnett say would disturb him to the point that he 'd apologize to his female @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought it was interesting how quick Cross was to insult some of his projects and their audiences . He 's ... honest . We 'll give him that . <p> PANEL RULES ! Some audience behavior seems to repeat itself panel after panel . We 'll be updating a running list of " PANEL RULES !

 recent surge in coverage of Rick Santorum following his Iowa success and the ongoing focus on his " Google problem , " it 's interesting to remember that that ... other definition of the candidate 's last name was coined all the way back in 2003 , when the White House was just a glint in the Senator 's eye . More than ever , though , the issue and definition is in the news and in his weekly column this week , the man behind the " santorum " ( and would n't anyone love that title ? ) , Dan Savage , defended the coinage and its continued importance . <p> As Savage writes an advice column , this week 's maintained the structure of responding to letters ; in this case , one letter thanking him for the " santorum " work and two decrying it . To the first writer , he pointed out that much of the thanks belongs to his readers , especially the one who first had the idea to make up a word for Santorum 's name . The second letter came from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pathetic excuse for a human being " for trying to " insert himself " into the Presidential race . Savage reminded him that the definition had been around long before Rick Santorum had enough clout to market his own sweater vests . <p> The third letter writer accused Savage of hypocrisy for creating the " It Gets Better " Project , the online movement to record messages of hope for LGBT teens suffering from bullying , while at the same time bullying Santorum . Savage wasted no time in snuffing that argument . <p> " Taking the piss out of a middle-aged bigot who has repeatedly and viciously attacked a tiny minority for personal and political gain a man surrounded by people who support him personally , politically , and financially is not the moral equivalent of beating the shit out of a vulnerable and isolated 13-year-old queer kid in rural Texas who is a member of the tiny minority that this powerful bigot has repeatedly and viciously attacked . <p> Third , circling back to Elizabeth Santorum 's blowjob on HuffPo : ' Elizabeth is aware of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a campaign by columnist Dan Savage ... " That just makes me sad . It 's disappointing that people can be that mean , " she said . ' <p> I 'm sorry for giving you a sad , Elizabeth . You know what gave me a sad ? Reading about Janice Langbehn and Lisa Pond . The women , together 18 years , were vacationing in Florida in 2007 with three of their four children when Pond suffered an aneurysm . Langbehn and the children were barred from Pond 's room when they arrived at the hospital . A social worker informed Langbehn who was distraught that she would n't be able to see her wife because they were in an ' anti-gay city and state . ' <p> Lisa Pond was not a ' policy thing , ' Elizabeth . She was a human being . And her wife and children were prevented from saying good-bye to her because people who agree with you and your father people who doubtless felt empowered to act on their bigotry thanks to high-profile bigots like you and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> Many people who just see Rick Santorum as another GOP candidate with a chance to oust Barack Obama forget about the values and ideas that he has been espousing for years and the very real ways they affect people in this country . They see the whole Google thing as juvenile and , y'know , it is . After all , it 's basically just an incredibly complicated poop joke . However , it 's the most important poop joke of our time ( again , who would n't want that title ? ) . Until Santorum takes back his hateful comments , that definition will haunt him . In a perfect world , his comments themselves would follow him but we live in a 24-hour news cycle so that 's impossible . His " Google problem " will have to suffice , working as a perfect , frothy reminder of the things he stands for . <p> Oh yeah , I forgot . There was also a fourth letter in the column about Savage 's definition for the word " rick . " I 'm not gon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just have to Google it .

 no other subject more sensitive right now than the place of women in comedy . And it 's not like comediennes do n't have good reason to be touchy . We are , after all , only a few months past a news cycle in which people were writing serious articles asking if a new movie could finally prove that women were funny ... in the year 2011 ! Think about that . <p> So , it 's not surprising that a small firestorm has brewed over a New York Times profile of Eddie Brill , the veteran stand up and comedy booker for The Late Show with David Letterman . In it , Brill claims that female comics are n't " authentic . " Since the piece 's publication , it has inspired a ton of debate , including an argument between the reporter , Jason Zinoman , and Brill himself , with Brill saying it seemed like " had it in for " him . <p> Brill 's certainly right that the profile is n't an exactly flattering depiction . At it 's heart , it 's one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a network late night show " pieces , but this one in particular seems to make Brill out to be a dinosaur , featuring negative comments from up and coming stars like Anthony Jeselnik and Amy Schumer . However , what really got people 's dander up is a section in which Brill seems to hold onto a world view that was already dated in the days of Johnny Carson and Joan Rivers : <p> " Among some comics ' Late Show ' has a reputation for favoring a certain profile . ' The types they seem to like are middle-aged white men from the Midwest , ' the comic Amy Schumer said . Only one woman ( Karen Rontowski ) was booked in 2011 . ' There are a lot less female comics who are authentic , ' Mr. Brill said . ' I see a lot of female comics who to please an audience will act like men . ' <p> Jessica Kirson , a comic who has performed on ' The Tonight Show ' several times but not on ' Late Show , ' responded : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' I like Eddie but the only way to make it as a female comic is to have strength and be assertive and confident . ' " <p> It was n't long before the Internet filled with scathing indictments of Brill , including one for Mirth Magazine which claims Brill 's irrelevance ( " We all well know that the days of comedy kingmaker Johnny Carson granting a comedian a career with one simple motion toward his couch are a thing of the past . " ) and argues that his " authenticity " critique is merely code " code for ' women are n't funny .

 was conspicuously absent from Monday night 's Fox News South Carolina Republican Debate was whether the candidates endorse that state 's continued flying of the Confederate flag in front of their capitol . With yet another debate scheduled for tonight , on CNN , the issue may come up , as it did at 2008 's CNN South Carolina debate . Current frontrunner Mitt Romney spoke out clearly against the flag then , while challenger Newt Gingrich recently defended the flying of the Confederate flag . <p> In 2000 , the state of South Carolina reached a compromise on the issue of the Confederate flag , which used to fly over the capitol dome , but is now relegated to a less-prominent position in front of the capitol . That compromise , though , was overwhelmingly rejected by the state 's black caucus , and by the NAACP . The NCAA still boycotts South Carolina over the decision . <p> Gingrich was recently asked about flying the flag in South Carolina ( the questioner was booed ) , and responded with the predictable " states ' rights " argument , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slavery , two other issues that have historically been tied to states ' rights , under that same flag . Here 's the exchange , via ThinkProgress : <p> Please enable Javascript to watch . <p> Newt 's reasoning flies in the face of the Civil Rights movement , which seeks to protect minorities from the tyranny of the majority . It 's a convenient , winking dodge . <p> Current frontrunner Mitt Romney , on the other hand , spoke out so strongly against the Confederate flag in 2008 , a pro-Confederate group actually ran ads against him ( and John McCain ) . When Romney was asked about it at that 2008 debate , he began with that realpolitik look of discomfort , hemming a bit and saying , " I 'm not going to get involved in a flag like that " ( translation : I wish you were n't asking me this ! ) , but to his credit , went on to say he agreed with the rest of America 's decision not to fly that flag , and spoke about its divisiveness : <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot of conservatives who will groan at this question and consider it a trap , but really , it is a great crucible to judge the courage and conviction of these candidates . Avoiding the question of whether the Confederate flag is a racist symbol by evoking " states ' rights " is sheer ( ironic ) cowardice . If you believe all of that " Heritage , Not Hate " guff ( funny , you never hear German-Americans clamoring to fly a Nazi flag on public property ) , you ought to be willing and able to articulate that point . <p> If you believe it is a symbol of racism , of those who fought under it to protect the enslavement of other Americans , you should say so , even if you think it might cost you some votes in South Carolina . Hell , if you make your case well enough , you might change a few minds . <p> Nobody is saying you ca n't fly the flag on your lawn or at your business .

 Winthrop University panel Thursday , MSNBC host and NBC White House correspondent Chuck Todd ripped into Stephen Colbert and his not-yet-official run , suggesting that Colbert might have some ulterior motives in the way he 's almost throwing his hat into the GOP primary ring : <p> " Is it fair to the process ? Yes , the process is a mess , but he 's doing it in a way that it feels as if he 's trying to influence it with his own agenda , that may be anti-Republican . And we in the media are covering it as a schtick and a satire , but it 's like , ' Well wait a minute here ... ' he 's also trying to do his best to marginalize the candidates , and we 're participating in that marginalization . " <p> Todd said that the " mainstream media " ( his quotes ) has a responsibility to exercise some caution and question what Colbert 's agenda is . " Is it to educate the public about the dangers of money in politics and what 's going on ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Republican party ? I think if I were a Republican candidate , I 'd be concerned about that . " <p> While expressing admiration for how Colbert has exposed a lot of the idiocy involved with the marriage of politics and money , and saying he enjoys his show , Todd went after both Colbert and Jon Stewart for mocking members of the media , then backing off and saying " we 're just comedians " when the members of the media call them out on it . " Actually , no you 're not comedians anymore , " Todd said . " You are mocking what we 're doing , and you want a place in this , then you are also going to be held accountable for how you cover and how you do your job . " <h> Year of the

 key strategies President Obama is utilizing in his reelection bid this year is to run against the " do-nothing Congress , " and on Fox News Sunday today , Chris Wallace asked House Speaker John Boehner to respond to that line of attack and the notion that Congress has been increasingly ineffective . Boehner argued that the focus of House Republicans over the past few months has been on job creation , and pointed to recent successes on the payroll tax cut and unemployment as evidence that Congress has been able to work with the president . <p> Conversely , Boehner argued that Obama 's policies " have failed to get our economy moving again " and made the economy worse . Wallace pointed to studies that showed this current Congress has been the least productive in years , with only 80 laws passed with 20 percent of those focused on naming buildings and other " housekeeping " measures . He contrasted Obama 's middling approval rating with a 19 percent approval rating for House Republicans . <p> Boehner 's argument basically boiled down to " quantity over quality , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it that much more effective . In fact , he argued that " most Americans think we 've got too many laws already , " while pointing to 30 bills the Congress pushed through to help improve the economy . Wallace pointed out none of them ever actually got through . Boehner countered that everything they did was in service of the American people . <p> Wallace wanted to know if Boehner 's attitude that Obama 's policies have failed , especially going into an election year , would make this coming year of Congress less effective than last year . Boehner suggested some provisions proposed by Obama 's jobs council are exactly what Republicans have been pushing for . <h> Ending a Good 
 place you get your news is from the Sunday talk shows , you would not have been informed in the slightest today about the political and technological battle over the Stop Online Piracy Act last week . Yes , there was a huge primary yesterday that completely up-ended the Republican contest , but you 'd figure a powerful people-powered protest resulting in some of the biggest and most visited websites either blacking out or using their resources to raise awareness of the bill would garner at least a brief discussion today . <p> The only exception was Howard Kurtz , who did his due diligence bringing up the conflicts of interest inherent in the media 's coverage of SOPA and how some networks were better at disclosing such conflicts than others . However , Kurtz only brought this up at the tail end of Reliable Sources for about two minutes , so if you were n't paying close attention , you might have missed it . <p> And it 's not just the Sunday shows . On Wednesday , the day of the blackout , none of the primetime shows on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at all except for Rachel Maddow . It 's honestly embarrassing . Yes , it 's awful and/or hilarious how the rest of the Republicans are going after Mitt Romney for being a wealthy venture capitalist . And who knew that Newt Gingrich had marital issues ? <p> But if your argument defending these hosts is " Oh , well they probably had more important issues to cover ! " how is it that Lawrence O'Donnell found time to talk about but not the blackout ? I completely agree with his position on profanity , but when in the editorial process did they decide " Internet freedom is good , but ABC primetime programming is just a little better " ? <p> This needs to be part of the conversation . We are talking about the future of the internet . And whether you support SOPA or oppose it , we all use the internet . That 's how you 're able to read this column right now . There has been some coverage of SOPA and the like last week in the lead-up to and in the reaction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> It was encouraging to see John the GOP candidates about SOPA during last week 's CNN debate , but with the exception of Ron Paul , I do n't think any of these candidates actually cares about the bill . Gingrich had a good line explaining that as a Republican , it would be foolish of him to look out for the best interests of Hollywood . But only Paul has been bringing up SOPA without being prompted , because he actually forms opinions on things before the media starts to notice them and does n't immediately drop an issue just because the media coverage has ended . In fact , Paul gave a shout-out to anti-SOPA activists during his post-primary speech last night , though he accidentally referred to the bill as the " Stop Online Gambling Act . " <p> Please enable Javascript to watch . <p> To Romney 's credit , he did come out against the bill even though its author , Texas Congressman Lamar Smith , endorsed him back in October . But Paul is the only candidate who understands more people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they would be , if not for the fact that the media 's coverage of it has been increasingly lacking . <p> The day of the blackout , Hollywood Reporter 's Eriq the media coverage of SOPA leading up to Wednesday 's protest . It was relatively satisfying for people concerned about the bill to see anchors like Chris Hayes and Erin Burnett bring the topic up for discussion on their programs , but Gardner took issue with how they personally handled the discussion . <p> Hayes wanted to know why so many people were protesting the " consequences of legislative change , " struggling to figure out a way to steer the debate where he wanted or needed it to go : the potential obligations , for better or worse , of US-based tech companies to do something about foreign-based piracy . <p> Burnett talks about discovering a little website called Pirate Bay , and tosses a softball to Wales about whether the site is a problem . Yes , says Wales . She follows it up by asking for an example of how the legislation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but we wonder if Burnett is really listening to any of the answers given . At an earlier point in the interview when Wales is describing , Burnett is murmuring assent as if she wants to get onto her next question on her checklist , and after getting a cursory response to the free speech question , Burnett is already onto her next topic by invoking Murdoch 's most basic criticism . <p> In short , Burnett highlights the most heated rhetoric in the debate and in doing so , demonstrates a lack of patience and curiosity about what 's really going on . <p> On Greta Van Susteren 's website , the only item that mentions SOPA is a press release from Lamar Smith 's office posted verbatim the day before the blackout . And on the day of the blackout , MPAA head Chris Dodd appeared on Morning Joe to defend the bill . In the video below , Dodd refers to the blackouts by Wikipedia and others as an abuse of power , with not much of what he 's saying being challenged by the hosts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " red herring , " but it 's a very real concern shared by people inside the tech industry and legal experts . Some coverage of this bill has basically been no more than " Well , the bill is called the Stop Online Piracy Act . Why do n't you want to stop online piracy ? Huh ? " That 's not the point . The difference of opinion is not whether piracy is good or bad , but what is the best method to deal with piracy . But by giving the bill that misleading title , it hoodwinks some of the less aware media personalities into assuming that is what the debate boils down to . <p> Here 's another example . Lamar Smith , the Texas Republican who proposed SOPA in the first place , has another bill out there called the Protecting Children From Internet Pornographers Act . If all you knew about the bill was its title , you 'd automatically assume that anyone opposing it is okay with internet pornographers . Once again , it misses the point . A provision of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accused of child pornography , mandates that all ISPs collect information for all users including " customers ' names , addresses , phone numbers , credit card numbers , bank account numbers , and temporarily-assigned IP addresses . " <p> Some blogs and message boards have been trying to bring some attention to the and the ACTA treaty being voted on soon by the European Union to create internationally mandated limitations on the internet in other nations , but they 've gotten almost no traction . Anyone who understands the media knows it has enormous power to shape the agenda . And based on how the media coverage of SOPA is back to almost non-existent , many people might wrongly assume the debate is over and the bill has been shelved for good . SOPA and its Senate counterpart PIPA have not been " killed , " as some media outlets have phrased it . They have merely retreated for now , ready to strike again long after people have stopped caring . SOPA will be revisited a few weeks or months down the road , but the media @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regulate the internet and try to at least have an open and honest dialogue with people about it . <h> 13 Centuries Of

" Mitt Romney released an attack ad highlighting the comment , which he was forced to defend during Thursday 's CNN debate . Chris Wallace confronted Gingrich about the comment on Fox News Sunday today and tried to get Gingrich to clarify what he meant . <p> Gingrich argued that he never once used the word " Spanish " in his comments , and the point of his comments was to try and encourage more people to speak English so they can get ahead in the United States . He accused Romney of manipulating his words , but Wallace played the clip and pointed out not only is Spanish one of the most widely-spoken languages in the United States behind English , but Gingrich actually apologized for his comments in Spanish after the controversy first emerged . <p> But what bothered Gingrich more was that his initial comments were about promoting cultural immersion in America , and that is a policy Romney has himself supported in the past . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and noted that at no point in his apology did Gingrich deny his comments were specifically targeted at the Spanish language .

 Race : Night Of The Tucking Dead <p> Last night was special . An event . A holiday . An ( eleganza ) extravaganza . " Why did my bosses make me work today ? " a friend asked me . " Do n't they know , " he wailed , " that today is Gay Christmas ? " Yes , last night gave us the season premiere of RuPaul 's Drag Race , the best show on TV that is n't about a Minnesota teen 's inability to stop eating laundry detergent while not knowing she is pregnant . <p> As with any new season of a reality series , the first episode of season 4 was approached with some trepidation . We were cautious , hesitant , unwilling to have our hearts broken by another Jujubee or Pandora fading too soon , unable to root for a Rebecca Glasscock . Who are these queens , we asked ourselves , who are teetering across our screens , snatching up wigs , begging us to love them ? Or , in the case of Willam , begging us to love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the City ? Because Willam was on Sex and the City . She played Samantha 's merkin . <p> For their first challenge , the queens were asked not to kill Shangela , of season 2 and 3 infamy , when she leapt out of a box . They succeeded , but just barely . <p> Next , the contestants were asked to don giant lampshades and stand on a revolving wooden platform while two half-naked men squirted them with " toxic waste . " It was less " post-apocalyptic " and more " misguided hipster birthing plan , " and involved lots of shrieking and falling down while RuPaul made snarky and increasingly nonsensical comments . " Ooooo , . London Bridge is falling DOWN ! " " Do n't leave your cake out in THAT rain , ! " " Watch out , butterface . When my arthritis acts up , I get ! " Which is to say : This is what fans have been impatiently awaiting for . Jiggly Caliente , whom the other contestants have already dubbed " Jigglypuff , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> And then , the runway challenge . The queens were asked to put together their best approximation of post-apocalyptic couture using whatever materials they could snatch off a gaggle of zombie drag queens , including contestants of seasons past . It was ugly , it was bloody , it was depressing , it was that time I went to Akbar and all they played was New Wave . So much runny eyeliner , so many listless bodies . Such little appreciation for my dancing . <p> The best runway look , hands down , belonged to the incomparable Sharon Needles , a satisfyingly frightening blend of Bettie Page and Marilyn Manson , dipped in Tim Burton with a brief stop at the Hot Topic clearance bin . Her outfit was very Hellraiser Chic , and worked perfectly because , unlike so many of the contestants , it made no attempt at being cute or sexy or overly literal .

How about 10 minutes of her getting super high on TV ? <p> During last night 's episode of her We reality series Joan &amp; Melissa ( which she teased on Jimmy Fallon last week ) , Rivers and her friend Lynne Koplitz bought a bunch of medicinal marijuana , found a quiet spot to park their car , talked about how cute that dispensary doctor was , and lit up .

 common talking points among the Republican party is that the Democrats like to engage in " class warfare " and pitting Americans against other Americans . Which is something the Republicans would totally never do , except , you know , when it comes to those places like San Francisco or Chicago . Bill Maher noted this discrepancy in his final New Rule of the night , where he tore into Republicans for pitting the heartland against the coastal elites . <p> Maher called out Republicans for criticizing Democrats over pitting the 1 percent against the 99 percent , but went down a list of cities and states that Republicans have openly expressed an extreme distaste for . It 's quite a list . And just the mere mention of Massachusetts is enough to get a CPAC crowd wildly booing . <p> Then Maher offered the following hypothetical to illustrate just how much conservatives really do n't care for places like New York City . <p> " If Sarah Palin were president and terrorists struck New York again , she would say two things . First , is Mount Rushmore okay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't hit the real America . " <p> Conversely , this line of thinking is not common among Democrats . Sure , you have a few liberal pundits here and there who always get in a few swipes at states like Texas ( might Bill Maher belong in that list ? ) , but you really do n't see Democratic politicians piling on parts of the country they do n't like in the same way Republicans do . And as for Newt Gingrich saying the New York subway system is a den of elitism , that claim could not be farther from the truth , unless somehow " elitism " has become synonymous with " everything is covered in piss .

 from the 2012 campaign and the workings of the White House , Jon Stewart turned to the issue of Congressional insider trading members of Congress privy to private information because of their committee assignments who can legally use that information for profit . As Stewart put it , it 's a system of checks and balances : " they deposit checks ; it increases their balances . " <p> Stewart became increasingly frustrated with the language members of Congress used to describe the situation , and how each in turn evaded responsibility . It came to this : one member of Congress making the point , as if having just discovered America , that Congress should , in fact , follow the same laws that other Americans do . " Yes , Congress should follow the same laws as everybody else , " Stewart mocked , " I think that was part of the No Shit Sherlock Act of Always .

 's Coverage Of Iran Is Being Framed By Memories Of Iraq <p> Many of you may have noticed increasing media attention devoted to a possible war against Iran , and the ever-ominous Iranian nuclear threat . It 's been getting more and more coverage , particularly since reports that Israel may attack Iran sometime this spring . <p> At The Huffington Post , Michael some concern about how this story is being reported , and wondered to what extent the media can " meaningfully assess " what numerous sources are saying . It 's become conventional wisdom , he writes , that Iran is currently pursing a nuclear bomb . Calderone says the media is amplifying this , but notes " the reality is much more opaque . " <p> Nonetheless , major networks and other media outlets have been commenting on this story . Just a few of the examples he includes are : <p> It 's the sort of thing you would produce if you set out to create a mean-spirited parody of mindless , war-hungry , fear-mongering media stars , but you would n't dare go this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel of realism to it , and this would be way too extreme to be believable . <p> Burnett responded via Twitter : <p> @ggreenwald We do many angles over time . I 'm proud of my and my team 's work . And I 'm glad I went to Iran , not many have . Thanks for watching . <p> We simply do n't have very many details about the situation ( and of course there 's conflicting information ) , and that makes the complex topic difficult to report . Calderone 's piece does an excellent job of discussing the way the media is addressing it , and it includes a wealth of information and background . Toward the end the piece , he makes a particularly good point : regardless of the truth behind the Iranian threat , we can not escape viewing it through the lens of the Iraq War ( and the often-cited WMD debacle ) . <p> Calderone quotes NBC investigative correspondent Michael Isikoff : <p> " People who are skeptical about claims about an Iranian nuclear program will point to the Iraq experience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they 're right and it does n't mean they 're wrong . It just means , it 's just a historical fact that we 're going to look at these issues through the lens of the misleading claims that were made about Iraq . " <p> Hindsight , as they say , is 20/20 .

 Breitbart reminded Occupy protesters at CPAC that their movement had a serious sexual harassment and rape problem , Breitbart and many in his company have been repeatedly making the point as a reminder to a public that has mostly forgotten that Occupy exists that they are not , in the aggregate , the most serious group of political dissenters . This has gotten the attention of some of the lower-tier fringe left , with the latest of these being noted political scholar Alec Baldwin , who added this veritable contribution to politics today : " Andrew Breitbart is a festering boil on the anus of public discourse . " <p> It 's a classic , because it 's the kind of insult that tells you nothing about the person being insulted and everything about the person lobbing it . The comment , which surely many will find witty and/or accurate , came about as a result of DeFace ( aka ) tweeting Baldwin for comment on Breitbart in relation to the Shirley Sherrod scandal or rather , theorizing that the " rape rant " against the Occupy protesters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shirley Sherrod was getting in the news these days . That was all it took for Baldwin to deliver an answer that plays so well into Breitbart strategem one has to wonder whether Breitbart did n't pay him to tweet that himself . But no , this is what the man all the Democrats want to run for the mayorship of New York ( now that Anthony Weiner is out of the running , of course ) sounds like . <p> Breitbart took it in good humor and equally as maturely , responding , " There 's NO REASON you should talk to me like I 'm your daughter ! " Baldwin responded to the counter by calling Breitbart a " witless , no-talent toad , " which is a little less insulting than " festering boil , " in that toads are sentient ( and sometimes cute ! ) beings . Breitbart responded in kind , making a Kim Basinger joke , calling Baldwin " , " and filling up his Twitter stream with responses to Baldwin and his fans ( and , occasionally , noting that Alec @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ response begins like this : <p> This continues for some time , and Alec Baldwin , who started the fight , finally tweets " OK , enough festering boils for this weekend .

 son of Robert F. Kennedy is facing charges of harassment and endangering the welfare of a child after an incident last month in which he tried to take his son from the maternity ward but ended up attacking nurses attempting to stop him from taking the child away . While they are misdemeanor charges and the doctor in charge takes his side , he is accused of kicking and forcefully grabbing the wrist of one of the nurses , and security video shows the altercation . <p> NBC New York broke the story of the charges last night , which note that the doctor in question claims to have suggested Kennedy take a walk with his son but the nurses refused to allow him . According to NBC , a deposition shows the head nurse stating Kennedy wanted the child to " get fresh air , " and the nurse denied him permission . He then tried to go down the stairs anyway but the nurse barred him from doing so while another tried to grab the baby . " While holding the child in his right arm , Kennedy kicked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her backward onto the floor , police said , " the report concludes . <p> Fox News has reported this story , and Kennedy and his wife had given NBC a statement : " The nurse had no right to attempt to grab our child out of his father 's arms and I , Douglas , was shocked and appalled when she did so .

 week of hearing about KONY 2012 , the campaign is slowly but surely coming under a lot of warranted skepticism . Any activist video that starts by spending two minutes on the power of liking YouTube videos and Facebook statuses should raise a few eyebrows . But what other viral marketing campaign can tout " taking down a Ugandan warlord " as one of its ultimate goals ? This highly controversial campaign was debated by the panelists on This Week today , with half of them sharing their skepticism of the campaign and the other half singing its praises . <p> George Stephanopoulos began by saying that " something remarkable has happened on the internet " with the campaign to make Joseph Kony famous . Mary Matalin described how she first learned of the video from her 13-year-old daughter ( who apparently thinks this would be a great issues for Republicans to capitalize on if they want the youth vote ) , before taking the position that having such a complex issue be in the hands of teenagers is probably not a good idea . Because who better to understand the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where it is on a map ? <p> Austan Goolsbee somehow likened this to the popular TV show America 's Most Wanted , before saying that it 's exciting that social technologies are being used on such a global scale , and " dictatorships being brought down by Facebook . " Stephanopoulos rightly brought up the term " slacktivism " as an important part of what 's going on here . And while Goolsbee is certainly right that social media has been used to bring down dictators in the past few years , the key distinction here is that in places like Egypt , it was the people being oppressed using these tools . KONY 2012 is all about the Western world using their Mighty Morphin ' Power Tweets to make Kony famous . The problem with Hosni Mubarak and Moammar Gaddafi is n't that no one knew who they were . <p> Eliot Spitzer , meanwhile , took issue with the " slacktivism " term , insisting KONY 2012 will slowly go from pure online activism to people taking to the streets and demand something be done . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ focused on the power of social media . He said , " it 's got to be good for humanity . " Nicolle Wallace said its purpose could only be served with follow-through , further actions merely beyond tweets and such . <p> Jake Tapper had what was the best and most well-reasoned take on the campaign , bringing up his own attempts to get Kony and the Lord 's Resistance Army into the news . <p> " Awareness is a good thing . As somebody who tried and failed to get stories on air to get the public interested when Obama sent 100 special forces troops to central Africa to take on Joseph Kony ... as somebody who asked President Obama about this last October when there was very little interest in getting that question and answer out there for the public , or very little interest in awareness for the public , bravo to them . <p> " But the question is to what end . There are things in that video that are not factually accurate . He 's not in Uganda , Joseph Kony . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there are probably between 150 and 300 . " <p> This is the important distinction those of us less enthusiastic about this campaign need to make . No one doubts that a focus on this tragic situation is n't important , but when the facts are not presented accurately ( and by an organization which has a less-than-impressive reputation ) , it 's okay to be skeptical . That does n't make us heartless people who want to see this evil man in power . A girl who suffered at the hands of Kony himself is not a fan of this campaign . And a simplistic portrayal of Ugandan history is not helpful here . As HuffPo 's Michael last week : <p> I think it is easy for Invisible Children and other self-aggrandizing foreigners to make the entire story of the last 30 years of Northern Uganda about Joseph Kony , but there is a history of the relationship between the Acholi people from whom the LRA emerged and the central government in Kampala that is a little more complicated than that . <p> As far as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for his crimes against humanity .

 Trayvon Martin Is Not A ' Black Problem ' <p> A very young person was killed last month , for carrying a bag of Skittles and an iced tea . His killer made a dubious claim of self-defense , despite being explicitly told by law enforcement he had no right to confront the teen and his Skittles for his " suspicious " behavior . The claim worked , and witnesses say that police officers told them they were mistaken when they tried to say it was the teen who cried out for help , and not the killer . Trayvon Martin 's death is a harrowing story , particularly given that his killer , George Zimmerman , seems to have escaped any brush with the legal justice system . It should alarm any American than our legal system protected Zimmerman 's liberty after his crime . So why are only black people talking about it ? <p> Like many outside the Orlando area , I first encountered the story on Twitter , with a link to the New York Times ' Charles Blow 's recounting of the events . The facts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Trayvon had left the house he and his father were visiting to walk to the local 7-Eleven . On his way back , he caught the attention of George Zimmerman , a 28-year-old neighborhood watch captain , who was in a sport-utility vehicle . Zimmerman called the police because the boy looked " real suspicious , " according to a 911 call released late Friday . The operator told Zimmerman that officers were being dispatched and not to pursue the boy . <p> Zimmerman apparently pursued him anyway , at some point getting out of his car and confronting the boy . Trayvon had a bag of Skittles and a can of iced tea . Zimmerman had a 9 millimeter handgun . <p> The two allegedly engaged in a physical altercation . There was yelling , and then a gunshot . <p> When police arrived , Trayvon was face down in the grass with a fatal bullet wound to the chest . Zimmerman was standing with blood on his face and the back of his head and grass stains on his back , according to The Orlando Sentinel . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acted in self-defense , despite disobeying police orders , despite later being found to be a serial 911 caller , and despite having warned neighbors , as " neighborhood watch " leader , to keep an eye out for " young men who appeared to be outsiders " by the Miami Herald . Martin 's parents are crying murder and , of course , racism . Zimmerman 's parents claim their son is Latino , and therefore could not be racist . As he has not been charged with anything , and we know for sure he shot Martin , calling this a murder is not , by any means , a legal conclusion that a court has arrived at . The difference between murder and manslaughter or other homicide is " malice aforethought " an elusive term but , to me , if repeatedly calling 911 and warning people about suspicious young black men , before actually killing one in defiance of law enforcement orders is n't " malice aforethought , " I 'm not sure what is . <p> Most of the media is crying neither racism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the online uproar began in earnest over the weekend , the next week will provide many opportunities to bring the story to light . As of now , however , the most vocal in bringing the story to light have been cable news tweeters like Blow himself , Tour ? , Goldie Taylor , and Roland Martin , among others . Al Sharpton has announced he is organizing a rally in support of Trayvon Martin . Many black commentators began using a phrase that I had never quite understood before to describe the situation : " There but for the grace of God go I. " <p> As for coverage of the matter on television , the TV Eyes television transcription database shows that CNN has been on the forefront of covering this story since March 10 particularly Don Lemon on his broadcast yesterday . Among the non-CNN cable news networks , only MSNBC 's Al Sharpton , Martin Bashir , and Alex Witt , Melissa Harris-Perry , and Fox News ' Harris Faulkner having the distinction of reporting on the story at all . To date , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appeared on Roland Martin 's Sunday program , Washington Watch , where Trayvon Martin 's parents appeared to tell their story : <p> Please enable Javascript to watch . <p> The coverage of the story in passing on national news networks , in depth among black critics highlights both the integral need for diversity of experience in the media , and the consequences of a media without enough people who can speak to issues which are unique to certain American narratives that those in the outgroup will never understand . <p> Several reasons exist for the divide in black and white media regarding how they approach this story . For one , the reasons for Martin 's death necessitate an understanding of racism that only black people particularly black men fully understand . As a white Latina , I can say , without a doubt , that no one looks at my skin ( or my name , for that matter ) and feels fear . I can understand bringing that out in people for immutable traits I know what it 's like to forget @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prompting bad service at a store or " this town is going to Hell " comments from locals . I know what it 's like to see your dad stopped by a cop for having a mustache . But , for the most part , no one knows I 'm not " the right kind " of white without an extra clue . People like me do n't have to deal with " it , " usually . Given that my family barged into the American history narrative almost a decade after the Civil Rights Act passed , they likely could have avoided dealing with it had they been here , too . <p> Trayvon Martin , like so many " suspicious-looking " young black males with similar fates , did not have that luxury . No one can hide his or her skin color and , in the context of vigilante violence , the false threat of black skin is a uniquely black male problem . That does n't mean that those who have not experienced it can not see why it is so obviously troublesome , nor does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more just legal system that sends a clear enough message that murders like Martin 's are so unacceptable that they will , for the most part , go away . That lack of joint responsibility may be the single most troubling part of this story . <p> When Caylee Anthony disappeared , Nancy Grace almost single-handedly decided for us that this was America 's Problem . For a good year , this was America 's Problem . This was America 's Problem despite the fact that , by the time Caylee 's mother was arrested and acquitted , there really was n't anything anyone could do about it . Black media leaders had to cover Casey Anthony 's trial , too . And Joran Van Der Sloot 's . And Amanda Knox 's . The lack of reciprocity , particularly in cases with black victims , is stark and needs to be addressed . <p> The media wo n't be able to comfort Trayvon Martin 's mother . It wo n't be able to erase the memory of her son , the sound of his cries for help as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be able to do much about Zimmermann 's tragically flawed understanding of what a criminal looks like , or the violently distorted moral code that enabled him to I believe commit such a crime . The media can she 'd light , however , on what sort of legal system let 's a man like Zimmermann free , and encourages others with similar understandings of the " shoot first , ask questions later " doctrine to continue thinking as they do , because the law has them covered .@@807569 <h> Selena 's Widower 
 , MSNBC host Lawrence O'Donnell invited Joe Oliver , friend and spokesperson for unindicted Martin shooter George Zimmerman , on his program " The Last Word . " O'Donnell also invited New York Times ' columnist Charles Blow to participate in the discussion . What followed was a theatrical performance that should give the overtly progressive network and O'Donnell 's audience pause . <p> Oliver , who says he left his job as a local correspondent for a CBS affiliate to defend Zimmerman against a flurry of personal attacks in the national media over his role in the shooting death of Trayvon Martin , is a brave soul . To call Zimmerman persona non grata would be a step up from his present status ; at least an untouchable can be seen in public . For Oliver to act as a character witness for Zimmerman is courageous by any standard . O'Donnell took the opportunity to berate Oliver , as was to be expected .

He routinely interrupted Oliver . He asked and answered his own question and was openly dismissive of Oliver when his assertions are challenged . Blow mocked and chided his subject , making aggressive and leading assertions that Oliver , had he been a less grounded man , would have risen from his seat to protest . <p> Blow may fancy himself a prosecutor in this particular arena , but his performance ( and it was a performance ) most closely resembles the faux justice handed down by Andrey Vyshinsky , Stalin 's prosecutor general at the height of the Soviet show trials . Vyshinsky 's prosecutorial style characterized by pompous grandiosity and leading so objectionable as to be comical was legendary . He played to an audience , much like Blow , nursing a blood lust that must be sated . Vyshinsky always delivered much like Blow did for O'Donnell 's loyal audience of progressives . This spectacle was a show trial . <p> There will be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be an indictment handed down . Those that are passionate about this case and feel there may have been misconduct that may prevent Martin from facing justice should protest . They should feel free to vent their emotions . But those few blessed with a national television program should feel the weight of responsibility on their shoulders . Restraint should be the hallmark of their coverage of this divisive pending criminal case . <p> But why get in the way of a good mob ? These petty details would tamp down the raw emotionality of the moment , stoked masterfully by Blow and O'Donnell ( in the interview , Washington Post columnist Jonathan Capehart was so restrained and respectful of Oliver that O'Donnell cut him off in the middle of a sentence . Capehart obviously did n't get the memo impartial deliberation was not what they were looking for ) . <p> I wish I could say that O'Donnell 's program last night broke from form , but it did not . The addition of Blow to the mix was just over the top . They know precisely what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Perhaps they were taken by the passion of the moment and their better judgment was consumed by righteous justification .

In the end we think that Trayvon 's life has to be defended , and he should defend himself because he was the person that shot Trayvon on that dreadful night . " <h> Slovakia Celebrates Day 
 Of Apologies <p> It has been a fateful year for the cable news network MSNBC . It seems every month , another host or even the network itself is forced to apologize for reporting a factual error or overstepping the bounds of responsible commentary . <p> **38;156;TOOLONG <p> The most recent apology to come out of the cable network at 30 Rockefeller Plaza is The Last Word host Lawrence O'Donnell . On an April 3 segment , O'Donnell characterized the Church of Latter Day Saints as an " invented religion " and said that Mormonism was started by " a guy in upstate New York " who " got caught having sex with the maid and explained to his wife that God told him to do it . " <p> That understandably offended some , and O'Donnell was forced to publically apologize on an April 11 broadcast . " I am truly sorry if I said something inaccurate about Joseph Smith , " O'Donnell said . " I am happy to provide time on this show to a Church of Latter Day Saints spokesman to correct any inaccuracy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A quick trip into recent history reveals a troubling trend of apology-worthy offenses . <p> The Roberts Affair <p> MSNBC news broadcaster Thomas Roberts got himself into hot water recently when he broadcast a segment on a leaked memo authored by the National Organization for Marriage , which identified as a political strategy pitting African Americans who may be hostile to gay marriage , against same-sex marriage activists . Roberts booked a guest representing NOM to appear on his show , but when she ostensibly failed to show Roberts conducted a mock interview of her empty chair . The implication was that the NOM representative was simply too cowardly to appear and face the music . <p> On March 4 , Roberts was taken in by a satirical piece posted on Huffington Post in which a mock NOM boycott of Starbucks helped their stock price shoot up by . Roberts broadcast the satire as fact and was later forced to admit " we take issues of equality seriously , not as satire . It was my error . " They take every issue of equality so seriously , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down to the disclaimer of satire on the site before becoming incensed enough broadcast this easily falsifiable story as news . <p> The Racist Edit Of George Zimmerman 's 911 Call <p> On April 3 , NBC News itself admitted to an " error " in their broadcast of a misleadingly edited 911 call made by George Zimmerman on the night he allegedly murdered Trayvon Martin . That call , which also aired on MSNBC , was edited to show Zimmerman offering the skin color of Martin unsolicited when in fact the dispatcher had asked for that information . While this admission does not necessarily constitute apology , the concession of an " error " will have to do . <p> Mitt Romney Is Racist <p> In December , 2011 , MSNBC ran multiple reports based on a bloggers assertion that Mitt Romney 's presidential campaign had adopted a slogan , " Keep America American " that was originally used by the Klu Klux Klan in the 1920s . <p> " So you may not hear Mitt Romney say ' Keep America American ' anymore . That 's because it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it was a rallying cry for the group 's campaign of violence and intimidation against blacks , gays and Jews . The progressive blog AmericaBlog was the first to catch on to that , " said Roberts during his dayside news program . <p> On December 14 , 2011 , Hardball host Chris Matthews delivered the mea culpa for the network . " During the 11AM hour on MSNBC , " Matthews said , " we reported on a blog item that compared a phrase used by the Romney campaign to one used by the KKK in the 1920s . It was irresponsible and incendiary of us to do this and showed an appalling lack of judgment . We apologize to the Romney campaign . " Matthews apology was reiterated by Rev. Al Sharpton on his program which immediately follows Hardball , saying that MSNBC " did the right thing " by apologizing to Romney . <p> Chuck Todd 's Bad Morning <p> Also on December 14 , NBC News Chief White House Correspondent Chuck Todd was caught alongside Meet the Press host David Gregory just before being called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finger salute to the production staff just off camera . " The camera is always on . A lesson some of us never learn , " Tweeted a chaste Todd . " My apologies . Am personally embarrassed . Was a joke with someone on the other side . " <p> But perhaps the most egregious serial is Ed Schultz , anchor of the primetime weekday program The Ed Show . In the last year , Schultz has been suspended once and forced to apologize no less than three times . <p> " Rightwing Slut " <p> In May , 2011 , Schultz was suspended briefly and forced to apologize to conservative radio host Laura Ingraham for calling her a " rightwing slut " on the air . He later called his own comments " vile " and offered Ingraham an apology which she accepted . <p> Rick Perry Is Racist <p> On August 15 , 2011 Shultz aired an out-of-context clip of Texas Gov . Rick Perry describing the state of the nation as being darkened by " a black cloud . " Perry was referring to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the clip and presented it as Perry talking about President Barack Obama Obama , of course , being the black cloud . Schultz attempt to imply Perry was voicing a racist sentiment backfired and he later was forced to admit " we did not present the full context of those statements ... It was a mistake and we regret the error . " Rather than admit an unqualified apology , however , Schultz couched his admission of fault in an attack on his opponents by airing the full clip of Perry in context and making the same argument that Perry was , in fact , a latent racist . <p> Virginia 's Republicans Are Nazis <p> On February 22 , Ed Schultz 's radio producer James Holm issued an apology for comparing the Republican members of Virginia 's legislature to Dr. Joseph Mengele . The entire exchange between Schultz and his producer is too long and obsequious to reproduce here , but it falls more in the category of a " you were offended , so I apologize " apology while still maintaining that Republicans are Nazis . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out hope for is his admission that he should have disclosed the in payments he received from the Communications Workers of America union . A disclosure would have prevented the appearance of a conflict of interest when this host helped man the picket lines alongside union members celebrating the successful referendum repealing Gov . John Kasich 's curtailment of public sector union 's collective bargaining rights or the recall elections of Wisconsin state senators . <p> Schultz has defended his union earnings , saying that he works for his payments by booking speaking gigs for the labor organization . He should not , however , be surprised then when his credibility on organized labor issues is called into question . <p> Give credit where its due . They do seem willing to apologize when their mistakes are caught . But in MSNBC 's year of apologies , some would say its the offenses for which no apology was ever issued that are the most telling and instructive about the culture at play there . @ @ @ @ @ 
 Out of Touch Like Mitt <p> Ann Romney is on Twitter . And she 's not happy . Late yesterday evening Mrs. Romney made her debut after Hilary Rosen , noted democratic strategist , said about her : " She 's never worked a day in her life . " To which Mrs. Romney replied : " I made a choice to stay home and raise five boys . Believe me , it was hard work . " <p> Now Rosen , a fellow mom , was n't just taking a random potshot at Mrs. Romney . She was was referring to the notion that the Romney campaign would be rolling Mrs. Romney out to blunt th the stark reality that he has issues big ones with women voters . The Obama campaign has a nearly lead among women voters under 50 . And Mr. Romney is so concerned he 's resorted to using dubious statistics to help his cause . <p> According to him , of the jobs lost during the recession under President Obama 's watch were held by women . What did the nonpartisan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Romney 's fingers are probably still stained from cherry-picking the numbers from the Bureau of Labor and Statistics . By counting job losses from Pres. Obama 's first month in office , January 2009 ( the president was n't sworn in until the 20th day ) , up until March 2012 , Mr. Romney found that women lost 683,000 jobs while men lost 57,000 . Those numbers are true but they do n't tell the whole story . <p> Historically men are the first to lose jobs when a recession occurs . The recession started much earlier than the president 's swearing in : From December 2007 between June 2009 men lost jobs and women lost 2,124,000 jobs . So really it was a matter of time before the recession was going to begin to affect women even more , particularly because they are overrepresented in education and government employment both industries hit hard by GOP-favored cuts in spending . <p> One would think Mr. Romney then would favor the Lily Ledbetter Fair Pay Act , which made it easier for women to sue over discriminatory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet . But maybe that 'll change like so many other positions do . He also does n't support Planned Parenthood . ( At least not anymore , but sure did when he was governor of Massachusetts ) . While they are a lightning rod for the abortion debate , they also provide an extensive amount of contraceptive needs for low-income women at a time when research shows a reduction in abortions can be attributed to a long-term supply of birth control . <p> Enter Mrs. Romney to make that critical connection with women voters who just ca n't embrace a candidate who has yet to embrace them . But how relatable is Mrs. Romney to the average woman voter ? Not very . She had the luxury of staying home to raise her 5 boys . While many women only dream of it , Mr. Romney 's private equity work brought home the millions that financed the reality . <p> Plenty of women rightfully aspire to spend more time with their children at home , for the purposes of leisure or home schooling . The difference between Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means of support . According to Pew Research Center , in 2009 , of women with children 17 and under worked outside the home ; of those worked full time . And of those women not working , could n't find employment and were laid off their last job . <p> There 's no doubt Ann Romney is a strong woman . And no one is questioning her character . She 's a breast cancer survivor who was also diagnosed with Multiple Schlerosis in 1998 , when her youngest son , Craig , was age 17 . But the reality is Ann Romney now has the hardest job she has ever had : convincing people to vote for her husband .@@851663 <h> Defense Industry 's 
 compelling , if insane , 10 minutes or so of television , but there 's really only one section that we need to unpack to truly understand what 's at play with a certain corner of the conservative web . <p> Last weekend , we reported on the way CNN 's language standards have occasionally been pushing the envelope recently , notably with Don Lemon 's uncensored use of the n-word when he argued that , in the context of reporting a news story , " I do n't care what color the reporter is , I think someone should say ' that person called him a nigger , ' rather than ' the n-word , ' because it sanitizes it . " <p> That principle was put into practice the following morning when reporter Susan Candiotti quoted the Facebook page of a suspect in the Tulsa shooting spree , which said " Today is two years that my dad has been gone , shot by a fucking nigger . " <p> We also noted that CNN had relaxed language standards a few weeks ago , playing an uncensored clip of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Newsbusters ' Noel Sheppard had no problem with the " f-word , " but had this thoughtful critique of Lemon 's premise : <p> Now , weeks after the shooting of Trayvon Martin as the media try to fabricate a race war to assist the reelection of Barack Obama not only are CNN employees saying n ger on the air , a CNN host is advocating the previously offensive term be used in all reports rather than the politically correct one . <p> Let that sink in . Two stories , six black shooting victims , but Noel Sheppard thinks that quoting the word " nigger " is the problem , and it 's somehow going to lead to a " race war . " The shootings of black people are n't the problem , the calling black people " nigger " is n't the problem , it 's the accurate quoting of that word that 's going to cause a deadly race war . <p> With six black shooting victims at the heart of this story , a reasonable person might think that Sheppard was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dispelled that in his segment with Lemon last night . After repeating the claim that a race war is imminent because people are talking about racism ( not because of the racism ) , Lemon said " I do n't think we 're on the verge of any race war here . I think we 're beyond that in the United States . " <p> " Dyson , " Sheppard continued , " on Face The Nation today with Bob Schieffer , and he was saying that if Zimmerman is found innocent , there 's going to be a lot a lot of problems . There 's going to be a lot of uprisings . So it 's not just me saying that this is possible , Don . " <p> It 's amusing that Sheppard would confuse Michael Eric Dyson with the textbook example of modern , but is it a telling Freudian slip ? Maybe not , but Sheppard also seems to have a problem telling one black pundit from another . While Dyson did appear on Face The Nation , it was Tour ? who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If you think I 'm reading too much into that , remember what Sheppard claims was said , and listen to what Tour ? actually said : <p> Please enable Javascript to watch . <p> So , how does " But , I mean , if this is found not guilty , there will be tremendous , lasting pain , at least in black America , behind the situation . It will be a scar on the soul of America , " become " if Zimmerman is found innocent , there 's going to be a lot a lot of problems . There 's going to be a lot of uprisings ? " <p> " During the Civil Rights movement , " he explained , " look at the reporters asking Dr. King , not about the vicious police brutality , not about segregation , not about Jim Crow , they are asking about what are the negroes going to do . We 're not going to acknowledge what we 've done , we simply want to talk about black response . And here now black people are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> There is a segment of the conservative media that has been eager to exploit white panic in the Trayvon Martin case ( and another segment that silently watches ) , but watching Lemon 's interview with Noel Sheppard was the first time I 've gotten the sense that some of them are in the grip of it . Learning to tell black people apart , and actually listening to what they have to say , are a couple of steps they could take toward escaping that grip . It also would n't hurt if conservatives who know better would speak up . <h> The Silver Lining 
 Harry Reid ( D-NV ) delivered a spirited defense of the United States Post Office on Thursday , telling his Senate colleagues that while most of the parcels delivered today are " what some people refer to as junk mail , " it remains elderly American 's " love to get junk mail " and feel that it 's " their only way of communicating or feeling like they 're part of the real world . " <p> Addressing the Senate , Reid began his defense of junk mail saying that " elderly Americans rely on the United States Postal Service . " <p> " I 'll come home tonight here to my home in Washington and there 'll be some mail there . A lot of it is what some people refer to as junk mail , but for the people who are sending that mail , it 's very important , " Reid said .

 persons case of Etan Patz , a young boy who went missing in SoHo in 1979 , has been reopened after authorities discovered hair and a possible blood stain in a basement near the location where Patz is thought to have disappeared .

 pretty fascinating controversy . A seriesofstories in the British tabloid The Daily Mirror about a couple of alleged sexual assaults in Germany is taking a fair amount of heat . The reason being that they have been charged with sexism . However , unlike most " sexism " stories , the paper 's victims are men . <p> The stories in question report on a sordid situation in Munich . A woman has been arrested after allegedly bringing two men back to her apartment ( not at the same time ) , having sex with them , refusing to let them leave , and forcing them to continue having sex with her against their will . One man had to escape to a balcony where he flagged down police . Another was , in the words of the Mirror , " found sobbing in the street " after his ordeal . <p> The whole story is pretty terrible . However , what 's caught people 's eye is the fact that the British paper is reporting the whole in a fairly comedic tone which many have pointed out would be unheard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Interest in the most recent article was prompted when a critique of it ( and people 's reactions to it ) became a top story on Reddit . The Reddit post , headlined " Sexism works both ways you know ? , " currently has nearly 3,000 comments . The commenters spilled over onto the Mirror website where they slammed reporter Natalie Evans ( whose name is currently only on the original article ) for her coverage of the story . <p> Amongst the charges : <p> The woman is repeatedly described , not as a rapist , but as a " nymphomaniac , " a term that even the Mirror admits is not medically accepted anymore . <p> Instead of images denoting a crime , the photos attached to the articles are stock photos of sexy couples having ( presumably ) consensual sex . The accompanying article defining " nymphomania " is perhaps the most egregious example . <p> The name of the initial victim is given . This has apparently been removed from the current online version of the article . <p> It 's hard to argue that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about a man refusing to let women leave his apartment until they had more sex with him . <p> Is it sexism ? There 's still a societal disconnect with the way male rape victims are treated , particularly if the rapist is a man . The crime is still seen , at best , as being funny and , at worst , as being impossible . You can see this reaction whenever female teachers molest their male students and the young boys are viewed as being " lucky " instead of being victims . And , apparently , the same goes for the coverage of adult male victims as well . <p> If you want any better example of that , check out the comments on the article about the first man . Unlike the one for the second victim , it does n't look like the Reddit critics have gotten to this one . So these are the only comments : <p> So , what do you think ? Were the Mirror articles inappropriate ? And , if so , do you think it was sexism ? <h> Why Chronically I 'll 
 been a vaguely conservative streak in modern horror films . For instance , the preeminent sub-genre of recent decades , the slasher film , has frequently featured the " punishing " of young people for their sexual proclivities ( the babysitter and her boyfriend get it on , a man with a knife hacks them up ) . However , at least the kids in those movies got to have actual sex ... with another person . That does n't seem to be the case in a new film that takes the " socially conservative horror " idea to its logical conclusion . In other words , here 's a Christian horror film about ghosts attacking people who jerk it to porn ! <p> The movie is called Harmless and it 's about a family being torn apart by a haunted box of porn , a phrase so , uh , terrifying that it makes me giggle just typing it ( always the sign of effective horror ) . Here 's the description from the official website : <p> " Harmless is a feature film shot in the popular found footage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father and his battle with a box of porn that is found in the closet . Once opened , the box of porn begins to torment the family , much like a poltergeist . It 's sort of a social commentary on how pornography can destroy a family . " <p> " Sort of " ? That is an incredibly conversational official description . I guess these are cool , casual religious people ? <p> But I digress . Actually , this might just be what the country is asking for . I mean , in addition to being a sexy , topless corpse delivery system , horror is also the film genre best suited for examining the values and fears of the times . And we just had a genuine presidential candidate talking about banning porn while the country , for some reason , did n't respond by pointing and laughing at him . Maybe America is ready for haunted porn . <p> Besides , the trailer looks kind of fun . They 're clearly working with the " Christian Rock Music Technique . " That 's where you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the real thing unless you listen closely to the words . <p> So , if we 're going to shame all of our teenagers into thinking that their favorite hobby is wrong and unnatural ( just the helpful message growing boys need ! ) , this low budget horror movie seems to be the perfect way to do it ! And , on the off chance that , like me , you do n't consider videos of naked people to be the greatest evil the world has ever known , you can just try and imagine this movie about a father opening up porn and having it ruin his life is actually a metaphor for annoying computer viruses . <h> Stylish Furniture Aims 
 Arnold an op-ed that appeared in the Los Angeles Times about the current state of the Republican party . Schwarzenegger reaffirmed his status as a dedicated member of the GOP , but expressed his hope that the party would try to seek compromise and not be so ideologically rigid in pursuit of an agenda . <p> Schwarzenegger proudly related how he was inspired to join the GOP after listening to Richard Nixon talk about " less government and taxation " and " the need for a strong military . " He marks this as the 44th consecutive year he has identified as a Republicans , but now he admits he feels less certain of his party affiliation than he did those many years ago . Schwarzenegger argued that in the current political climate , moderate Republicans like himself are not being treated well by certain factions of the party . <p> In the current climate , the extreme right wing of the party is targeting anyone who does n't meet its strict criteria .

 a lot of time afterward trying to walk that back , " Gregory shared , " first saying that the Vice President was speaking for himself , and then saying that he was totally consistent with President Obama . " He does think that this administration is " poised " to change its stance on same-sex marriage as President Obama 's ideas on it " evolve , " as he put it . <p> Scarborough found it noteworthy that someone would " evolve " on such an issue at the age of 50 . <p> MSNBC 's Chuck Todd then shared a story about Biden having been moved after attending a fundraiser at the home of a gay couple with a child . <p> " Well , is that the first time he 's ever been around a gay couple ?

What Biden has done has brought attention to the fact that the President is not , quote , " there yet . " <p> Gregory then added that the Obama administration is continuing to change : <p> I do not think that the Vice President was prepared to change administration policy on this , even though he may speak his mind more than the campaign would like .

So I do n't know how they ultimately choreograph this . But the expectation is if they get into a second term , that 's when it will be done .

 Obama SNL Sketch : ' I Do n't Have A Hard-On For Obama ! ' <p> Earlier today , we reported on The Daily Caller 's publication of a script for aSaturday Night Live sketch that was scratched from this weekend 's show , a post that carried the heavy implication that the decision was politically motivated . Since then , we 've contacted the writer of that sketch , Jim Downey , who tells us that he actually sent the script to Daily Caller publisher Tucker Carlson prior to Saturday 's show , and insists there were no politics behind the decision to scratch the bit . <p> According to The Daily Caller story , they " obtained " the script of a sketch that was " critical of President Barack Obama , " but which never aired . From The DC 's Gregg Re : <p> The full text of the skit , which was authored by comedian Jim Downey , is viewable below . It is not clear why the skit was scrapped . <p> The real President Obama has faced harsh criticism in recent weeks for allegedly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the operation that killed him . <p> Instead of the skit , NBC opted instead to air a parody of Fox News Channel 's " Fox and Friends . " That skit , which also featured Armisen , mocked Fox News personalities by portraying them as clueless partisans . <p> What Re fails to mention is that sketch author Jim Downey is a friend of Daily Caller publisher Tucker Carlson , to whom Downey emailed the script before the show even aired ( Downey says he has a stable of friends he sends material to for feedback , including and beginning with MSNBC 's Lawrence O'Donnell ) . If it was " not clear why this skit was scrapped , " it 's because they simply decided not to ask Downey . <p> Although The DC never actually made their accusation out loud , Jim Downey heard it loud and clear . " There 's nothing unusual or sinister about cutting a piece , " Downey says . " It 's not as if an after-the-fact decision was made to take it out . " <p> He said that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " particularly the opening spot . " <p> " I do n't think there was a conspiracy , or anything , they just preferred the other piece , " he added . " Comedy is so subjective . I 'm sure the people who made the decision will say the piece they ran was funnier . " <p> Downey was diplomatic when I asked him if he thought his piece was funnier . " I think they were both funny . They were making two different statements . Mine was making the statement that there 's something kind of interesting and weird about the idea of having an anniversary of a hit , and theirs was making the statement that there 's something weird about anyone thinking there was something weird about it . " <p> While he thought the Fox and Friends piece that SNL went with was " more protective " of the President , he said " I guarantee you that Obama would laughed at my piece , because my piece was silly , I think . It was n't an angry laceration of anybody . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's suggestion that he 's a " right-winger , " telling me " Adam likes to do things like that from time to time , " and adding that " My politics is all over the place , I 'm a registered Democrat , but I 'm sort of hard-left on Wall Street , but I 'm more conservative on things like gun rights . " <p> He characterizes himself more as " skeptical and cynical " of all leaders . " I 'm definitely not a member of any team . " <p> I asked him if he made good on his 2008 promise to vote for Barack Obama if he were the nominee . " I did end up voting for him , there were a lot of reasons , but I just felt it was time for a change . Y'know , I think he 's a cool guy , I think he 's right that there 's a lot of economic problems that are not of his doing , there 's certain policies that I 'm not crazy about ... I could vote for him again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out . " <p> " But I certainly do n't have a hard-on for Obama ! " Downey says . " I also do n't think that he 's the greatest thing ever . It just depends on what comes up . This week ... what was funny was that there 's just something funny about the idea of commemorating , you know , an assassination ... not an assassination , but , whatever you want to call it , it was a targeted killing , just made me laugh . " <p> Downey also does n't see any problem with the President campaigning on the killing . " It would be political malpractice for a politician if he did n't remind people that he did it . Why on Earth would you not do that ? " <p> Downey also says he has " friends at every end of the political spectrum , " including The DC publisher Tucker Carlson . " I often send scripts of my material to a number of friends of mine , " including Carlson and " people like Lawrence O'Donnell " to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ share any of it before it airs . Once the show airs , it does n't matter so much because " a lot of what I write has zero shelf life . " <p> He says he sent this particular script to Tucker Carlson " before the show aired . It had nothing to do with after the fact , he 's just one of about 20 people I send stuff to , " including former and Senator Al Franken . <p> I asked Downey how he felt about The DC publishing his script . " I do n't mind them printing it , but the way it was presented was , they made it sound like some kind of conspiracy or crime had been committed , but ... they decide what they want to run .

Particularly over at Fox News . <p> Stewart took a look at how Vice President Joe Biden basically forced Obama 's hand , expediting the president 's announcement . " A big mouth friend of yours , you know , said something . Now everybody knows something about you that you were hoping to tell them in your own way , " Stewart said . " Congratulations , Mr. President . You really have walked a mile in gay America 's shoes . " <p> And then he moved on to Fox News , where one Shepard Smith remarked that the president was now " in the 21st century " and that Republicans were on the " wrong side of history " on the issue . Pardon ? Say what , Fox News host ? Thusly , Stewart ran through some past remarks about same-sex marriage on Fox News . There 's Newt Gingrich noting the " gay and secular fascism in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bill O'Reilly , who so eloquently described the issue 's " slippery slope " : " If you legalize gay marriage and gay sex and all of that , then anybody who wants to marry five people can do it , commune people can do it , you can marry a turtle . " ( In which case , Sen. Mitch McConnell 's vote would be a sure thing , as Stewart noted . ) <p> Fast-forward to present-day Fox , and cue the montage of remarks about Obama 's political calculation behind his gay marriage endorsement . Stewart remarked : <p> This is the true measure of how far we 've come as a nation . In like five years , the prime talking point from Republicans about people who support gay marriage has gone from , ' It will destroy society via turtle fucking , ' to , ' Oh , of course you 're for it , you 'll say anything popular to get re-elected . ' And that is progress . <p> Toward the end of the segment , Stewart turned to Hollywood Correspondent Jason Jones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all that important about the Hollywood lot . Jones , reporting from George Clooney 's Obama fundraiser , confirmed every stereotype . <p> Jones summed up the timing of the announcement and the fundraiser rather concisely : " It 's like going to Israel after killing Hitler .

 angry during an interview with Denver 's CBS affiliate Wednesday , chiding the reporter for asking questions about gay marriage and medical marijuana , blasting those issues as being insignificant . <p> The reporter , Shaun Boyd , asked the presumptive GOP nominee questions about same-sex marriage . Romney became visibly annoyed as Boyd pressed him with multiple questions for his distinctions between same-sex marriage and civil unions . <p> After a quick question on immigration , Boyd then asked Romney whether marijuana should be legalized for medical use and taxed . <p> A visibly agitated Romney cut the reporter off : " Are n't there issues of significance that you 'd like to talk about ? " <p> " This is a significant issue in Colorado , " Boyd replied . <p> " The economy , the economy , the economy . The growth of jobs . The need to put people back to work .

 the bullying story with Democratic strategist Jimmy Williams , Hall switched gears to discuss Romney 's testy response to a local Colorado reporter 's question about medical marijuana . Carney then played the old conservative media trick of blaming the media when their own candidate screws up , but he made the mistake of doing it to that media 's unamused face . <p> After she played the clip of the marijuana question , Tamron asked Carney for his reaction to a response that " people are raising an eyebrow about . " <p> " I 'll talk about the marijuana in one second , " Carney said . " What you 're doing here is a typical media trick . You hype up a story , and then you justify the second day coverage of the story by saying people are talking about it . Here 's how romney responded to it . Let 's move on to substantive issues . " <p> Hall was having none of that . " You did n't have to accept the invitation to come on , " she said . " You knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Carney tried to protest , but Tamron cut him off . " Hang on . You 're kind of in my house here . The problem is this . The story is out there . You 're right . I am not saying that we should belabor what happened 50 years ago . We 're talking about the response by the campaign and by the Governor . Not just on this issue . " <p> Carney tried to recover , and lighten up the mood . " You are bringing up a meta story . What is Romney 's response to this other non-story . I 'm trying to go meta meta on you and say " <p> " And we are not talking or demeaning listen , 50 years ago , I was a much tougher kid probably than Mitt Romney was in high school . I 'm not talking about the issue of whether he was bullying or not . He said he does n't remember . To be fair , I can not say he does . What I 'm asking you about is how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , how he handled the Colorado reporter . How he handled same sex marriage where he said he agrees with gay parents being able to adopt , but he does not agree with same sex marriage . Just the handling of questions on the economy . If you 're not comfortable about that , I am a-okay , but you 're not going to come on and insult me . You wo n't come on and insult the network when you knew what you were going to talk about . " <p> She then finished the segment with Williams only . <p> Carney is normally a moderate , uncontroversial presence on the network , but his suggestion that Tamron Hall was playing some sort of trick was out of line . In the middle of a segment about a poor response to a story about bullying , it does n't seem like a stretch to bring up an example of another poor response that essentially consisted of Romney attempting to bully a local reporter . Kind of a two-fer . <p> Carney was still around at the end of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off , I 'm sure he 'll be back .

 Chair Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz ( D-FL ) appeared on MSNBC with anchor Thomas Roberts on Tuesday to address the findings in a new CBS/New York Times poll released on Monday night which showed two-thirds of voters believe President Barack Obama decided to back gay marriage as a matter of politics and not as a personal belief . Wasserman Schultz told Roberts that the poll indicates how far Americans have come in accepting gay rights , and said that Obama believes in gay marriage rights . " This is the civil rights issue of our generation , said Wasserman Schultz . <p> Roberts first asked Wasserman Schultz to weigh in on a new USA Today/Gallup poll that shows Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney leading Obama among voters on the matter of " who would improve the economy the most . " That poll found Romney leading Obama by 55 to 46 percent on that question . <p> " What do you feel the President needs to do needs to do in the next few months to make sure that that impression is turned around so that impression is changed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you fight that ? " <p> " Well that same poll also showed that the majority of Americans are very optimistic about their own financial future , " said Wasserman Schultz . <p> " Do you think that 's because they think there will be a new president in place , " interrupted Roberts . <p> " Thomas , if you look at that same poll , it also said that the overwhelming majority of Americans polled there believe that President Barack Obama will be reelected , " said Wasserman Schultz . " What President Obama needs to continue to do is focus on creating jobs and getting this economy turned around . " <p> Roberts turned to the CBS/New York Times poll which found that 67 percent of voters believe that President Obama decided to back gay marriage rights " for political reasons " as opposed to the 24 percent who said he expressed support for gay marriage because " he thinks it is right . " <p> " The Washington Post then reported last week that one-in-six Obama bundlers are LGBT , so how do you answer that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pandering and doing so for voters , " asked Roberts . <p> " As someone who represents one of the largest LGBT communities in the country , I think it 's actually awesome that we 've come so far in advancing the rights of the LGBT community that people would question that it 's a good thing politically for a President of the United States to come out for marriage equality , " said Wasserman Schultz . " That shows the progress that we 've made . " <p> " This is the civil rights issue of our generation , " said Wasserman Schultz . " President Obama came out for marriage equality because he believes in it personally . He believes that no one should be discriminated against and that the laws of our country should reflect an opportunity for equality for all Americans regardless of their choices , regardless of their sexual orientation , regardless of their race , gender , or their sexual orientation .

 ' Mick Jagger ' In Front Of Actual Mick Jagger On SNL <p> Mick Jagger 's comedic abilities are limited , but opportunities to make fun of his image are infinite , and the sketch in which Jagger played a shy insurance salesman stuck at a karaoke bar on a business trip was a great chance for the show to exploit some of them .

 , business models change . Consumer habits make way for new avenues to watch media . And yet , it seems that even with the rise of the internet , there has been a rather lethargic embrace of an ever-expanding online audience from the broadcast networks . Fewer people watch TV shows live anymore when they know they 're going to be able to watch it tomorrow on Hulu . Services like Hulu and Netflix draw in more people to shows past and present , which could be a great boon to the networks , if only they learned to fully embrace it . <p> The reason I 'm bringing this up is because of the mess this weekend involving Dan Harmon , the showrunner of NBC 's Community . He was basically fired and replaced by two other guys who will most likely be retooling the show to appeal to a broader audience . Now , Community may not be the most-watched show on NBC ( far from it ) , but it has one of the biggest and most active online audiences of any TV show . Andy Forssell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that for their business model , they prefer Community to shows like The Big Bang Theory because " while it 's a smaller audience , it 's an audience that self-organizes online . " <p> As of 2010 , 26 percent of U.S. consumers watched TV shows online multiple times a week . Hulu , Netflix , and even YouTube are developing original programming . ( I ca n't be the only one who 's been seeing those WIGS ads everywhere on YouTube . ) So what is with the resistance from TV networks to embrace the internet ? Fewer and fewer people really care about TV scheduling . Last month at a conference run by the National Association of Broadcasters , Digitas executive Ashley Swartz argued that the TV advertising model has largely not changed even with all the new opportunities the internet has to offer . <p> Advertisers continue to primarily spend on traditional TV units , to allocate most of their budgets months in advance , Swartz said , even though changes in the digital media market and market opportunities continue to come at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ news why rush change and disrupt the revenue model that 's working for you . <p> But the problem , Swartz argued , is that because broadcasters still see most of their money in TV , they 're neglecting the money they can be making online . <p> " The misperception needs to get thrown out that the online audience is less valuable , " Swartz said . " I remember buying media five years ago , and the TV guys would throw in all the Web stuff for free . Based on what I 've seen from the upfronts , their approach to second screen is not much different . They do n't know how to value it , what the value of an audience or viewer is versus what it is on the big screen . There 's such a chasm .... So they may let it be a loss leader .

A more recent poll by Adweek finds that not only are 77 percent of people in the younger demographics are watching TV online , but 64 percent of the 55 and over demographic are watching online . <p> To be blunt , it 's not a bad thing for shows to be popular online and be rated poorly on TV . Judging by that one metric alone can lead networks to make bad decisions . Online viewership may fluctuate from time to time , and certain shows may be watched online more than others , but overall these numbers will shoot up .

 columnist Michael Goodwin appeared on Fox &amp; Friends to discuss the increase in food stamp recipients and New York Gov .

" Now we look at it we 've seen this explosion of entitlements and the sense of shame is gone . " <p> Goodwin says that under Presidents Bush and Obama the food stamp rolls have " exploded .

 recapping the remainder of the first season of Veep on HBO . The show is the brainchild of Armando Ianucci , whose BBC show The Thick Of It provided the launchpad for his foray into American television ( one that began with an ill-advised adaptation of The Thick Of It for network television . Both shows feature a gaffe-prone protagonist occupying a governmental office , and follow his/her staff 's attempts to deal with the constant stream of self-sabotage . <p> Well , Veep confirms all our worst fears about politics : no one is in it for the American people , everyone is preoccupied with their own image , and passing legislation and effecting change is constantly placed on the back burner , when it 's considered at all . This is certainly characteristic of the fictional administration on the show , headed up by a shadowy President whom we never see ( and who never calls ) , and co-helmed by Selina Meyers , played by Julia Louis-Dreyfuss . Meyers is a typical career politician , who has been in Washington for decades and is deeply committed to staying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advanced seems to depend completely on their intersection with her ability to remain in power , and she 's often not able to focus on them at all . Day to day , most of her time is spent getting herself into hot water , whether it 's repeating a " hoisted by our own retard " joke to the wrong crowd or referring to a Chinese American governor as " not a real American , " and her staff is also preoccupied with doing damage control . It 's a depressing view of American politics as petty , vengeful , indifferent to the needs of the people , and astonishingly small . <p> It 's also hilarious . The spareness of the show 's setup the absence of a laugh track , or music , or lots of transitions between scenes means that every singularly awful or misguided thing that Meyers says hangs in the air , settling horribly into everyone 's brains . In the most recent episode , the Clean Jobs bill , which Meyers had been laboring over for years , was dropped unceremoniously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Meyers and her team missed this development because it was only covered in the form of chatter on political blogs using one of Meyers 's nicknames Mrs. and she had asked her team to stop searching for news containing any nicknames , since she was depressed that they were so plentiful and so cruel . This is the kind of thing that Meyers specializes in : becoming obsessed with an issue 's personal implications for her to the point that she gets screwed in a different and more damaging way . She is the personification of not being able to see the forest for the trees . <p> Her staff , which has to placate her and perform damage control constantly , is made up of several identically foul-mouthed foot soldiers . The VP 's right hand woman , Amy , has to massage her ego , round up support for legislative initiatives , and head Meyers 's many gaffes off at the pass . Her head of communications has to try to make her look good , often resorting to desperate measures ( in an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ameliorate the situation by suggesting that maybe the joke would be bumped out of the news cycle if Tom Hanks died ) . Her secretary , Sue , serves as a hyper-competent buffer between Selina and the rest of the world . Her communications director has a deputy , Dan , who has already shown himself to be the most craven of the lot and generally very successful and Arrested Development 's Tony Hale rounds out the cast as an obsequious lackey who knows to bring Meyers ice cream she did n't even know she wanted . <p> It 's such a welcome departure from the hyper-competent portrayal of government officials in pop culture , and the show 's approach is refreshing . Essentially , Ianucci is throwing up his hands and admitting that our government is broken and we 're all on the path to disaster , but he does it with tight writing , good performances , and perhaps the most schadenfreude that it is possible to experience in one half hour .

The movie Chernobyl Diaries debuts in theaters tomorrow with plenty of frights and horror movie stereotypes and total disregard for the long-suffering history of the people of Ukraine and Belarus , who live with the health effects and mental challenges the disaster caused to this day . <p> The film 's trailer shows a cast of characters familiar to anyone who has seen Scream or I Know What You Did Last Summer : a haughty tragic hero frat boy who will inevitably succumb to his own hubris ; a bevy of gorgeous women who will follow him to his ( and their ) deaths ; the guide meant to help them who makes the visit to Pripyat go horribly wrong . But the film does n't go too deeply into why Pripyat and the great Chernobyl area is just so dangerous , nor does it detail the tragedy that befell the people on the region . <p> On CNN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reviewed the reaction to the film and the small but loud group that condemns the use of Chernobyl as a backdrop for a casually scary horror film . Hammer makes the point that " you 'd have to be in your thirties at least to remember the disaster , " and the marketing clearly targets young viewers meaning many do n't know enough about the situation to question the film 's premise or its acceptability in the realm of good taste . Hammer is right that the understanding of the Chernobyl disaster is such in the myopic historic world view of many in the United States that few will think twice about the film , that given the 26 years that have transpired between the event and today , many would just assume that the victims of Chernobyl are few and far between , and the situation has been contained . Kiev 's decision to allow disaster tourism into the Pripyat area corroborates that to a certain extent . But that 's not how nuclear disasters work the physical and mental toll on the people of Ukraine ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is immeasurable and long-lasting , and merits a respect absent this production . <p> Please enable Javascript to watch . <p> The Chernobyl disaster is arguably and in my estimation the single most malevolent event in the history of humanity . Its narrative contains every fundamental human evil : the hubris of individuals who believed they could contain the immense power of a nuclear plant without requisite safety gear ; the delusion of communist Moscow in believing they could lie to the entire population of the Ukranian SSR and , as the fallout spread , to the entire continent of Europe ; the suppression of critical thinking of an entire people to the point that residents of Ukraine and Belarus believed their government when they were told they could return to their homes in three days , and that the fallout was negligently dangerous . On the night of April 26 , 1986 , the workers at the Chernobyl plant had obvious signs around them it was time to turn the plant off they reported to Moscow they were seeing pieces of the uranium core outside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to turn the energy production levels up , not down . The children of the residents of Pripyat escaped their parents on night trips to walk around the fire and touch the fallout . None of this was avoidable , all a product of slow-motion human error . <p> The toll of the Chernobyl attacks on the then-Soviet people , as with all information governed by the Soviet Empire , is arguable , as the government refused for many years to acknowledge anyone had been harmed save the five or so workers who died in the immediate aftermath of the explosion . According to the UN , about fifty lives are attributable directly to the Chernobyl attacks . This does not include the numerous cancers and previously unseen diseases ( among them " Chernobyl heart , " known medically as a ventricular septal defect a hole in the heart that sends poisoned air otherwise to be filtered by the heart into the body , killing the victim . The number of Belarussian children exhibiting signs of this defect after the disaster are in the tens of thousands . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dismissed and disrespected by a state that , thankfully , no longer exists deserve better at this stage in the history of the disaster than to be the backdrop for yet another needless forgettable two-hour scare . <p> That 's not to say the subject matter is untouchable in film form films that explore the darkest parts of human history are often the greatest in the medium , and the suffering of hundreds of thousands of innocent people who happened to live in the region is a narrative ripe for the picking . But this film is clearly not about the suffering of a people who , straining under the yoke of communism , were befallen with the indignity of having the Soviet regime 's malevolent incompetence poison their homes to the point of unlivability . This is a film about some bros who think it would be fun to visit the formerly thriving city of Pripyat , Ukraine , and are led by their stereotypical Ukranian tour guide into some scary places . This film is a get-rich-quick scheme on the backs of a nation too vulnerable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be forced to remember . <p> The number of deaths and injuries caused by the disaster will be debated for centuries to come . The toll the event has taken on the identity of the Ukranian nation is unmistakeable , and those unfamiliar with the emotional wreckage left behind atop the physical wreckage should become acquainted with it enough to reject the exploitation of this pain . For those that have not seen it , the 2007 short film White Horse elegantly packages a nation 's pain in 20 minutes of video a trip back to Pripyat by a man who once lived there , at the age of 12 . Had the directors of Chernobyl Diaries seen the pain , individualized , one hopes they would have thought twice to reduce it to a marketing ploy . <p> An African migrant 
 to go after Walter Cronkite , " writes Douglas Brinkley in Cronkite , his new biography of the beloved CBS newsman . The book written with cooperation from Cronkite and his family " dents his halo , " Howard in The Daily Beast . Today , Cronkite 's stunts would have the likes of Kurtz himself calling for him to step down . <p> For starters , Cronkite cut a deal with Pan Am in the 1970s , furnishing worldwide travel for his friends and family . Everywhere from the South Pacific to Haiti . The " news division president , Dick Salant , was upset at what he deemed a blatant conflict of interest , but took no action against his star anchor . " <p> Cronkite 's image is , as Kurtz puts it , one with a halo . A " voice of authority in an age when we still revered , without a trace of cynicism , those who spoon-fed us the news . " But this biography shows that the man was more complicated and unethical than we know him to be . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conduct today he secretly bugged a committee room at the 1952 GOP convention he would have been bashed by the blogs , pilloried by the pundits , and quite possibly ousted by his employer . That he endured and prospered , essentially unscathed , until his death in 2009 reminded me of how impervious the monopoly media were in those days , largely shielded from the scrutiny they inflicted on everyone else . <p> " Nobody wanted to go after Walter Cronkite , " Brinkley says . Within CBS " he became a force of nature . He could almost dictate anything he wanted . He was the franchise . " <p> A liberal , Cronkite pulled stunts that made his political leaning abundantly clear . Meeting privately with Robert Kennedy , Cronkite told him , " You must announce your intention to run against Johnson , to show people there will be a way out of this terrible war . " Later , he had an exclusive interview with Kennedy , in which Kennedy left the door open for a possible run , announcing it three days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kurtz writes . <p> Kurtz 's full story is well worth reading in full , to get a better picture of Cronkite 's behind-the-scenes activity that would cause an outrage today ( misleading editing , anyone ? ) . But it 's a reflection of the times , Kurtz writes and shows us how much we 've changed over the years : <p> Brinkley 's book will undoubtedly tarnish the Cronkite legacy . But my admiration for the man is only partly diminished . Perhaps it is too easy to judge him by today 's standards , any more than we should condemn Thomas Jefferson for owning slaves . Perhaps he simply reflected his times , when some journalists and politicians quietly collaborated , when conflicts of interest were routinely tolerated , when a powerful media establishment could sweep its embarrassments under the rug . <p> Cronkite thrived , " always protecting what we would now call his brand , " Kurtz writes . " That 's just the way it was . " @ @ @ @ @

 discussion of Jeremy Scahill 's accusation of murder against President Obama , The Young Turks Power Panelist ? and Daily Caller columnist James Poulos ( he of the quest for what women are for ) made an interesting point about the use of drone strikes to kill suspected terrorists , and he made it in an interesting way . Host Cenk Uygur led the panel in discussing Scahill 's contention that drone strikes which kill civilians amount to murder , but Poulos challenged a near-untouchable premise about the strikes , and he did it with air quotes . <p> Waldman summed up the issue pretty well , saying that " we should n't make the mistake of thinking that the technology necessarily gives us an entirely different set of moral questions . You know , if its wrong to kill civilians , it 's wrong to do it when you do it from the air , from an unmanned aircraft or from a manned aircraft . Whether you do it on the ground with bullets . The moral calculation is the same , even if it allows our leaders to feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then asked the panel , " Can we get an agreement here across the political spectrum that if its an American citizen we should at least indict them in court before we execute them ? " <p> Here 's where I think Cenk ought to extend Waldman 's logic a bit . Whether you agree with them or not is a separate issue , but the premise of the drone strikes is that these are people who pose a foreign threat to the United States , and need to be killed . If that 's true , their citizenship status should n't be a huge issue , and if it 's not true , then we should n't be killing them even if they 're not US citizens . The right not to be killed unjustly is , in my view , a human right . <p> Poulos ' reply , though , contained a challenge to one of the more attractive things about drone strikes , the elimination of US casualties . " I do n't know if we 're going to get that agreement , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think it would be a nice thing to do at a minimum , and perhaps even a constitutionally necessary thing to do . " <p> " But given the fact that we want to fight wars on the cheap , " Poulos continued , " we want to keep people out of ' harm 's way ' ( using finger-quotes ) if they 're wearing an American uniform it 's sort of a strange way to fight a war it 's understandable in its way , but it 's something that I think people are ready to lose the thread on and let it go where it goes , unfortunately . " <p> The use of drones to eliminate US casualties is usually seen as an unquestioned good , but Poulos appears to be arguing that it also desensitizes us to the human cost , and perhaps makes it too easy for us to look away from what 's being done in our names . The finger-quotes appear to be an underscoring of the absurdity of a " harm-free war . " <p> It 's an interesting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ putting soldiers back in harm 's way instead of using drones , or only using drones to kill other robots , neither of which are likely to occur anytime soon . <p> Cenk concluded the segment by asking , " Paul , at least indict American citizens before we execute them ? Can I get that much ? " <p> Waldman agreed , and noted that the American people have been conditioned to believe in the guilt of so-called terror suspects . " That 's one of the legacies of the September 11th attacks , is that we 've extended the battlefield to cover the entire planet . And now , anywhere where we find somebody who we do n't like , that person can be called a bad guy and then the American public will say , ' Yeah , sure . Go ahead it does n't matter if he 's an American citizen . You can go ahead and kill him . ' And , you know , its one thing when you 're talking about somebody who is most certainly involved in terrorism , like , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , what if that next president decides , ' Well , you know , there 's some American ex-pat who 's living in Amsterdam and organizing an anti-American rally . Maybe we 'll send a drone to go kill him . ' " <p> Cenk renewed his frequent criticism of President Obama . " I 'll go one step further , " he said . " I 'm not worried about future presidents , I 'm worried about *this* president , okay ? Yes , I also care deeply about what future presidents might do , but I do n't trust our government . I know that 's a sacrilegious thing on television , but I do n't trust them , " citing the killings of Anwar al-Awlaki and his 16 year old son without due process . <p> Just a point of clarification . If you actually listen to what I was saying on " Up With Chris , " I was discussing two specific cases . One , was the December 17 , 2009 cruise missile strike on the Yemeni village of al . I investigated that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 30 minute documentary on it for al Jazeera . It was the first strike Obama authorized on Yemen . The vast majority of the victims 35 in all were women and children . The US used horrendous cluster bombs in that attack , which shred human beings into ground meat . Unexploded bombs killed more people a few days after the strike . That was not a drone strike . The other issue I discussed was the so-called " Signature Strikes . " The idea that you target people based on the fact that they are " military aged males " or patterns of travel or geography is extremely dubious and will undoubtedly result in innocent people being intentionally targeted . To me , drones are not the prime issue we should be debating ; the kill program is the issue . Whether it is Tomahawk cruise missiles fired from the ocean , Hellfires fired from drones , or AC-130s firing on people is , in many ways , a side issue . Those are the vehicles for implementing a policy . <h> Matthew Perryman Jones

 point margin of victory , race may have taken anywhere from 3-5 percent of the popular vote from President Barack Obama in 2008 . Harvard PhD candidate Seth Stephens-Davidowitz , whose research was released on June 9 , compared Google searches with " racially charged language " against 2008 vote totals from areas across the nation to measure racism 's effect on the election . The study controlled for votes Sen. John Kerry in 2004 to isolate race 's effect . Davidowitz says that the votes the President lost to racism gave Sen. John McCain " the equivalent of a home-state advantage country-wide . " <p> Much was made of a new ' post-racial America ' after the 2008 election , but the author 's claim that the President lost such a significant portion of the popular vote is evidence that this was na ? ve. 2012 could prove to be a much tighter race , and 3-5 percent of the vote could be enough to spoil the President 's election night if the election comes down to the wire . <p> Davidowitz , who discussed his work on New York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real problem . He sees race cropping up again as a political headache for the nation 's first African-American president , who has taken pains to avoid the issue as he has navigated a host of crises : <p> " If my findings are correct , race could very well prove decisive against Mr. Obama in 2012 . Most modern presidential elections are close . Losing even two percentage points lowers the probability of a candidate 's winning the popular vote by a third . And prejudice could cost Mr. Obama crucial states like Ohio , Florida and even Pennsylvania . " <p> Though its impossible to predict what will happen in November , Davidowitz sees evidence that racism 's effect wo n't shrink this time around . He cites the fact that a convicted felon won a staggering 41 percent of the vote in the West Virginia Democratic primary as evidence that perhaps it could get worse . In the face of a sluggish economy , the Euro Crisis and tensions across the Middle East , the Obama campaign certainly does n't need additional drags on its chances in @ @ @ @ @ <h> Gay White Male 
 Orange juice . Pickle juice . These are just a few of the juices I can imagine being preferable to a glass of cranberry juice . And yet , somehow lots of people enjoy it once in a while , and apparently kids are part of that category . I know this because as a result of Michelle Obama 's healthy eating initiative , the Department of Agriculture is going to institute new standards for what can be sold in schools , and that includes cranberry juice . Sorry , cranberry juice cocktail . Which is a thing that kids drink . Yum . <p> The new regulations are going to crack down on sugar allowances , and the sweetened cranberry juice cocktail is specifically going to come under much scrutiny .

And the cranberry lobby ( which is amazingly a real lobby ) is not happy about their products potentially being banned from schools . Cranberry growers from all over the country are trying to pressure the Congressional Cranberry Caucus ( which is amazingly a real caucus ) to " persuade agriculture officials to make an exception for cranberry products " in the new guidelines . The caucus , which includes John Kerry and Scott Brown , sent a letter to the Department of Agriculture asking for the special exemption . <p> A nutrition expert explained toUSA Today why this might not necessarily be the best idea . <p> " There 's no evidence of any particular public health problem to suggest that cranberry drinks should get a special exemption , " Wootan said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pressing Congress for nutrient standards that are weaker than what Coke and Pepsi have already agreed to . " <p> Placing cranberry juice in the same category with sodas and other sugary drinks is what the cranberry industry wants to avoid . <p> As do I , cranberry industry .

 last week about the middle school students bullying a bus monitor riled you up about young people these days , this might make you angrier . Middle school students in New York went on a field trip to the 9/11 memorial site and were subsequently kicked out after several of them were caught throwing trash in the fountains . And on top of that , one of the students got in trouble for having bullets in his pocket as they went through the metal detector . <p> One of the students told theNew York Daily News that his classmates were throwing baseballs in the fountains , while nearby witnesses said they saw " plastic soda bottles and other refuse " thrown in as well .

 On Cher 's Charges Of Racism Against Republicans <p> Paired with the chyron " Hollywood Hate Speech , " Sean Hannity 's panel on Tuesday night took on Cher for her charges of racism against Republicans . It 's about his record not his race , Hannity argued , drawing mixed responses from his panel with lack of kind words for Cher seemingly their only common ground . <p> Hannity began with a clip from Cher 's recent appearance on Randi Rhodes ' radio show . Asked about the hatred from Republicans , Cher said there 's " definitely " a " component of racism in it . " Republicans " just thought that they were going to be able to be in office forever , " she said and not only did that not happen , but " they dot thrown out and they got thrown out by a black man , " which is a " stumbling block they wo n't be able to get over .

Thus , she said , we have these people playing the race card , trying to divert attention away from the sinking ship that is his administration . It 's " a last ditch effort because they have nothing else to say . " <p> Holder then attacked Mitt Romney for outsourcing jobs during his Bain Capital days , with Hannity countering that Obama has not created a single job .

Barbara Walters kept a very tight grip on the rest of the panel ( Elisabeth Hasselbeck tried to jump into the fray almost immediately , and was gently rebuffed ) , though she seemed to be barely holding in her disdain as she introduced Hunter as " the sexy blonde " that politicians " ca n't resist . " <p> Walters 's first question for Hunter was about her relationship with John Edwards , which has apparently ended . Hunter said her reason for the breakup was that she " does n't want to hide their relationship anymore ... I 'm not a mistress , I 'm a mom . " This was too much for Hasselbeck , who jumped in to remind Hunter that " mistress " was exactly what she was during Edwards 's marriage to his wife Elizabeth . It got worse from there ; Hunter did n't acquit herself very well either when Whoopi Goldberg asked about the negative portrayal of Elizabeth Edwards in the book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whose husband you had an affair and a baby with ... it makes you look bad , " she said as her response was that the public perception of Elizabeth being a saint and John a demon is inaccurate , in her opinion . <p> And the hits just kept on coming , when Walters then asked Hunter about her accusation that Walters " screamed at her " and " bullied " her during an interview ; she has been doing interviews for 30 years , she said , and while she freely copped to " making people cry , " she was firm in her conviction that she 's never yelled at an interviewee . The rest of the co-hosts , seeming sort of exhausted and grossed out by the whole thing , all chimed in to agree that Walters does n't ever yell .

 like being called racist . They really hate it . That 's why , in recent years , many conservative outlets and commentators have funneled this anger into an obsession with the idea of " reverse racism . " Look at any recent news story that even touched on racial issues in the slightest way , and someone will be accused of being racist against white men and exhibiting the kind of oppression that I , as a white man , have had to deal with every single day of my life inside my imagination because it does n't in any way actually exist . <p> This silliness is obviously a response to decades of conservatives being depicted as out of touch and racist . Therefore , you 've got to give Salon editor in chief Joan Walsh some credit for coming up with the greatest troll move ever . When conservative sites accused her of being a reverse racist , she wrote a column comparing the Drudge Report to Stormfront , a KKK message board . <p> " Let 's call a spade a spade : the arrogance , hypocrisy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> Oh , my stripes and garters ! What could Walsh have possibly said to elicit that kind of hyperbole ? Let 's look : <p> " WALSH : On the other hand , I think President Obama is probably going to be kind of lucky on this one . The ruling helps him politically , but also his opponents are such incredible disarray . <p> The House Republicans want to repeal it , they want to run on this , they want to appeal to that base , and let 's say it it 's a white , older base that does n't quite understand the way healthcare works , but they 're worried that some people are going to get something for nothing . " <p> Please enable Javascript to watch . <p> Did you see it ? The racist part ? I 'll help you out . Apparently , in Sheppard 's view , pointing out that Republicans in America tend to be older and white makes you racist against white people . I guess there are a whole lot of racist statisticians out there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sheppard 's real problem was the second half of Walsh 's comment . <p> " Now imagine for a moment if a conservative commentator said of Democrats supporting ObamaCare ' it 's a black , younger base that does n't quite understand the way healthcare works . ' <p> There would be immediate calls from the left for said person 's suspension or termination . But because her racism is pointed at white Republicans , it 's just fine . <p> Lest we forget this is the same woman who in March wrote a column titled " What 's the Matter With White People " and is so proud of the idea she 's turning it into a book . <p> You see , racism for Walsh is a common theme to be repeated whenever possible . " <p> The whole thing is pretty ridiculous . First of all , it requires you to believe that Walsh was saying the Republican base does n't understand health care because they 're white . And , secondly , it 's part of this growing and disturbing trend of a defensive majority 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about actual political statistics , listing historical facts is racist now too ? <p> There 's just something so mind boggling about this all . Have years of seeing white men be the villains in movies made my fellow white men this touchy ? Are they this upset about being accused of being racist in the past that they go around , desperately looking to throw the word back at people ? <p> That kind of thinking is infuriating , which is why , agree with Walsh or not , you have to find her rebuttal from this morning a little hilarious . <p> From a Salon column entitled , cheekily enough , " Drudge Wo n't Link This " , Walsh points out that nothing in what she said was racist against whites in any way ( by the by , is now a good time to point out that Walsh is white ? ) : <p> " Simply observing that the Republican base is disproportionately white , or that Romney mostly surrounds himself with white people ( and acts felony stupid when in a crowd of black people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The questions come in when you try to analyze what it means . <p> I have argued many times that we should be careful when analyzing what it means .

But it 's got to be possible to ask what it means that 89 percent of Republicans are white , or that Romney seems most comfortable around white people , though he wants to lead a country that 's at least one-third non-white , without the outrage machine shrieking someone off the stage . " <p> That 's all well and good , but the really great trolling comes later : <p> " I 'll outrage some people by comparing Drudge to Stormfront , but I think they 're on a continuum , given Drudge 's obsession with black on white crime and his dragnet to find political examples of anti-white racism .

 's edition of Current TV 's The Young Turks , host Cenk Uygur lit into Fox News contributor John a Fox and Friends segment in which he bragged about suckering people into giving him money by pretending to be a panhandler . While Cenk 's righteous anger is perfectly justified , Stossel 's sick display is just a scratch on the surface of how the Fox News ( opinion programming ! ) -led conservative media hurt the most desperate Americans . <p> Cenk opened the segment by introducing a clip of Stossel 's Fox And Friends appearance , asking viewers to " see what he learned " from his hours of fake homelessness , spurred on by the fact that Stossel " heard " that some panhandlers make as much as a year ( more on that later ) . In the clip , Stossel reveals that he collected money at a rate of about a year ( for several hours ) , and concludes that this is evidence that you should n't give money to homeless people on the street . <p> " Yeah , " Cenk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people because I did an experiment where I sat on my ass , and some people were decent enough to think that I was n't messing with them , and thought I really needed help , and they gave me money .

A segment about how you should n't help the poor or the homeless ? " <p> " It 's not the Christian thing to do , to make fun of them , " Cenk concluded , " so stop pretending that you care about Christian values at all .

" <p> That blogger paid the man five dollars to tell her his story , none of which she checked , and all of which sounds like complete bullshit . The guy brags to her about not paying any taxes , yet lays out some kind of crazy fake panhandler 's honor code . She was suckered as badly as Stossel 's marks . <p> The immediate impact of Stossel 's gimmick is , I suppose , that people will hesitate to give homeless people money in the street ( although I suspect Stossel 's target audience does n't have that strong an urge to begin with ) , and there 's an argument to be made ( which Stossel conspicuously does n't make ) that there are better ways to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the poor for as long as I can remember , from Ronald Reagan 's " welfare queens " and " young bucks " on ( Stossel , to his extremely limited credit , leaves out the race-baiting this time ) , and this is n't Fox 's first foray into this territory , which might explain why , if you start to Google " Fox News Poor , " the top suggestion is " Fox News Poor People Have Refrigerators . " <p> Stossel should probably pay a royalty to The Daily Caller 's Matt Boyle , who pioneered the art of warning people against the danger of privileged white assholes gaming the system that 's supposed to help poor people . The natural reaction is that we should eradicate privileged white asshole fake reporters , but unfortunately , there continues to be an audience for this garbage , and that audience continues to support politicians who are dedicated to dismantling the safety net that 's supposed to protect the poor . <p> That 's where the real harm is .

" <p> Williams , referencing the former Massachusetts Governor 's description of assault weapons as " instruments of destruction with the sole purpose of hunting down and killing people " while signing an assault weapons ban in 2002 , asked Romney " On things , however , like Aurora , Colorado , do you see why Americans get frustrated at politics ?

" <p> Romney 's remark bears a buttoned-down similarity to the the Rev. Jeremiah Wright quotes that caused so much outrage in 2008 , and to those which did n't seem to bother people when they were made by white preachers in the wake of 9/11 .

What we can do is remove the impediments for free people wanting to build enterprises from having the capacity to do so and going to work to hire people and putting people back in good jobs . " <p> Romney also demonstrated the diplomatic chops he hopes to hone on this brief tour by throwing in a gratuitous shot at the place he was actually giving the interview in , telling Williams " We 're we 're at a point here where we have two different roads we can go down .

 to say that if the press has had a love-hate relationship with Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney before he became his party 's presumptive presidential nominee , the love is nowhere to be found in the coverage of the former Massachusetts governor 's trip abroad . Romney 's overseas mission was marred by several incidents and misstatements magnified by brutal coverage in the press . With the awful headlines fresh in mind , it is worth reviewing how then Sen. Barack Obama 's 2008 trip abroad was covered . Here 's a spoiler , it was viewed in an overwhelmingly positive light but it did n't have to be that way . Obama 's trip abroad could have been covered quite differently had any news organization been willing to buck the narrative that Sen. Obama was not prone to failure and highlight his own missteps overseas . <p> Mitt Romney 's campaign is being slammed in the media for committing myriad gaffes while on his trip to Europe and the Middle East . His criticisms of London 's security preparation were ill advised , despite that he was simply echoing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for weeks prior . Romney offended the Palestinian Authority when he said that there were cultural aspects to Israel 's economic success and Palestine 's stagnation . Finally , a campaign advisor annoyed the press when he told them to " kiss his a** " and to " show some respect " as they shouted questions at Romney near Poland 's tomb of the unknown soldier . <p> When Sen. Barack Obama embarked on his trip overseas to Europe and the Middle East in the summer of 2008 , New York Magazine was already describing him as a " rock star . " <p> A Pew Research Center study from the time noted that Obama 's European trip dominated 51 percent of press coverage during the last weeks of July . Another 7 percent of media coverage focused on the media 's coverage of candidate Obama and whether it was overly supportive . <p> USA Today 's headline reflected a moment of self-awareness when it noted that " Obamamania " was " in full flight ahead of tour of Europe . " They wrote that " Europe is about to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> It 's not only Obama 's youth , eloquence and energy that have stolen hearts across the Atlantic . For Europeans , there have always been two Americas : one of cynicism , big business and bullying aggression , another of freedom , fairness and nothing-is-impossible dynamism . <p> If President Bush has been seen as the embodiment of that first America , Obama has raised expectations of a chance for the nation to redeem itself in the role that at various times through history Europe has loved , respected and relied upon . <p> In an interview with The Times of London 's foreign editor Bronwen Maddox , National Public Radio 's host described Obama 's trip abroad as having been received like " the second coming of Charles Lindburg . " <p> Even the center-right Washington Times described Obama 's trip abroad as " gaffe-free " and " picture-perfect . " <p> But Obama 's trip abroad was not " . " It was , however , covered that way . <p> While in Oman , Jordan , in a sit-down interview @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United States ' focus on Iraq meant that American security priorities had " shifted away from the central front of terrorism . " At the time , this could have been covered as a gaffe as following major attacks in Europe in every year from 2004 to 2007 it would suggest a lack of interest in the threat of international terrorism . Couric declined to ask a follow up and moved on to what Obama felt was his " weakest area of expertise " in foreign policy . Obama 's answer to that was to correct an earlier potential gaffe , also covered peripherally , when he said that he was " disorganized . " <p> In Germany , Obama put the government in Berlin in a precarious position when the campaign requested that they address an adoring throng of 200,000 Germans from the Brandenburg Gate . The government hemmed over the appropriateness of such an event and why would n't they ? The Obama campaign had essentially requested that the German government abandon neutrality and make a political decision which would favor one or the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ campaign 's request and set him up in an equally high profile location , but without the historically significant backdrop of Berlin 's most recognizable landmark . Had the press covered this potential international incident as a gaffe , it may have marred Obama 's successful Berlin address . <p> Indeed , the New York Times ' Christoph that average Germans raised " ironic eyebrows " at the notion of a Brandenburg address by Obama " because they find such symbolic and emotionally charged events generally disconcerting . " But Peters exonerated the Obama campaign when he speculated that Chancellor Angela Merkel may have simply denied Obama the opportunity because she suffers from " an instinctive sympathy , perhaps rooted in her having grown up in East Germany , for such staunchly right-wing and rather gruff figures of American politics as George W. Bush and John McCain . " <p> Obama found his schedule so overbooked in Germany that he was forced to cancel a visit to wounded American troops in Landstuhl Regional Medical Facility . Republican operatives called Obama on the time he had to meet with European @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's troops . <p> " It was scheduled , we intended to go and we got wind that there was some concern that this might be perceived as political , because we were using campaign resources , " Obama told Fox News Sunday in London before leaving for Chicago . " I did n't want it to be a distraction . " And like that , the story died . <p> Ahead of Obama 's visit to London part of the last leg of the trip to meet then Prime Minister Gordon Brown , the two politicians had engaged in a public disagreement over the danger of broadcasting timelines for the expected drawdown of troops stationed in Iraq . In a joint press conference , Obama had to be prompted by reporters to acknowledge the " special relationship " that has existed between the U.S. and Great Britain for 70 years and stands as a central pillar of American foreign and security policy . How was this reported in CNN ? " Obama , Brown discuss special relationship . " <p> Without question , Obama 's trip abroad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trip is likely to do for his . But the coverage of the Romney campaign 's gaffes is a matter of intensity of focus . Had Obama ' star faded even slightly before his European trip , there is ample evidence that his sojourn into the Old World would not have also been marred by the occasional gaffe . <p> Sandy Lydon , 
 Republican candidate Mitt Romney would have to admit that he took Newsweek 's " Wimp Factor " cover in stride , but the same can not be said for some well-trafficked corners of the conservative media . Sites from to are gleefully disseminating a parody Newsweek cover with a thick , juicy entree of misogyny , with a side order of racism . The parody cover features President Obama , with the headline " The Whipped Factor . " <p> To be clear , my objection to the Newsweek cover has nothing to do with notions of " civility " or an aversion to name-calling . The problem with the cover is that the critique has no value . The term " wimp " is the vernacular of unimaginative bullies , and therefore does n't present a supportable thesis . Additionally , as another blogger put it , " it equates superficial masculinity with competence and integrity . " <p> By definition , the use of this critique says more about the person making it than it does about Romney . Michael Tomasky 's commentary makes the case that Romney @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alas , does n't pop on the newsstand ( that 's the place where old people buy printed versions of the news you read online ) . <p> However , the parody cover ( originated 's Jon Ham ) that 's being passed around the right-wing blogosphere ( with incisive commentary like " Heh " ) is a hideous example of the worst in political tit-for-tat . Rather than lampoon Newsweek 's desperation for attention , these folks decided to take a shot at President Obama , picturing him on a Newsweek cover with the blaring headline " The Whipped Factor , " and sub-headlines about the influence of First Lady Michelle Obama and senior advisor Valerie Jarrett . <p> In case you 're unfamiliar with the subtext , " Whipped , " in this context , is shorthand for " , " a pejorative meant to convey excessive deference to a female sex partner . Let 's not dwell on this , but simply imagine , for a moment , if influential , well-trafficked political websites like Politico or , hell , Mediaite decided to speculate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ayotte 's respective vaginae on Mitt Romney 's decision-making process . <p> As if that 's not offensive enough , let 's not discount the racial implications of calling our first black president , whom Ancestry.com has just linked to America 's first documented slave , as " whipped .

 by Fox News contributor Liz Trotta is such an obvious and ham-fisted attempt to bait liberals ( and other full-time residents of the 21st century ) that it 's tempting to ignore it . Chock full of nonsense about a supposed " double-standard " between coverage of First Lady Michelle Obama and prospective FLOTUS Ann Romney , Trotta 's " look at me , I 'm not PC ! " commentary does have value as a textbook example of the right 's tortured persecution complex . <p> The fulcrum for Ms. Trotta 's rant is a contrast between media reaction to Ann Romney 's t-shirt and the jacket worn by Mrs. Obama at the Olympics ( a rep for the designer , J. Mendel , tells Mediaite that the jacket was a loaner ) . According to Trotta , Ann Romney 's t-shirt was a " scandal , " while Mrs. Obama 's jacket " drew nods of approval from the media . " <p> Along the way , she points out how the press hounded Jackie Kennedy about her wardrobe , until she put her foot down , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was " unacceptable to critics , " while the media made a " big story " about a Kennedy woman falling off of her horse , but were n't quite mean enough about it for Trotta , and digs up the Hilary Rosen flap as evidence that " the ladies of the press ( so un-PC ! ! ! ) really believe they 're acting on principle , except that the principal is driven by envy , envy by a woman who managed to do exactly what their mothers told them , although they would never admit it ; marry a good , preferably rich man , raise your children full-time , and of course , dress like a lady . Come on , girls . Play fair . " <p> The truth , of course , is that there were no " ladies of the press " attacking Mrs. Romney over her t-shirt , unless you count Lawrence O'Donnell , and a random column here or there , and nobody , lady , press , or otherwise , indicated that Mrs. Romney 's use of dressage for therapy was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Romneys ' horse being used as a business deduction . <p> On balance , the coverage of Mrs. Romney has been overwhelmingly positive , and as Trotta even points out , when Hilary Rosen made a perfectly reasonable observation about something Mitt Romney said on the campaign trail , the entire universe rose up to smite her like Cthulhu on a Red Bull bender . <p> Facts are n't the point , though . Generating outrage from liberals and smug satisfaction from the Fox News audience over such anti-PC boldness is job one , and promoting the myth of conservative media victimization is a close second . Conflating partisan cable news personalities with " the press " is a tried-and-true tactic of right-wing watchdogs like Newsbusters , as is ignoring actual offenses by the media outlets they like . <p> That brings us back to Liz Trotta delivering a rant about the nonexistent persecution of Ann Romney on Fox News ... the same network whose hard news anchors , not their opinion hosts , accused Mrs. Obama of employing a secret terrorist greeting and called her " Obama @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opinion hosts have been attacking Michelle Obama for a little over four years now , while generously ( but conditionally ) calling off a " lynch mob " against her , the same network on which Liz Trotta joked about making Mrs. Obama a widow .

 , a guy could do worse . While campaigning in Florida on Monday , Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney accidentally told the host of a Cuban-American radio show that he 's a " big fan of ... " vagina . That 's the Cuban slang translation of papaya , among a list of fruits that Romney professed admiration for . Maybe his campaign should start selling those big foam fingers . <p> It could happen to anyone , really . The host , whose name is Carlos Santana , brought up the subject of fruit , in anticipation of Romney 's later visit to El Palacio de los Jugos , a juice shop owned by Reinaldo Bermudez , who was convicted of conspiracy to distribute cocaine in 1999 , and served three years in federal prison . <p> " They 're waiting for you with a mamey and a guayaba Cuban fruits here in Miami , do you like those ? " Mr. Santana asked . <p> " I am a big fan of mango , papaya , and guava , " Romney replied , to laughs from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there too .

 CNN : If Not ' Unbiased , ' Then Certainly Non-Partisan <p> On Tuesday , the self-described centrist cable news network CNN touted their unbiased coverage of politics in a press release . But , this week alone , CNN has frustrated both sides of the aisle with their refusal to allow professional talking point purveyors as much rope as they often receive in other venues . But what some may mistake for bias could also be construed as effective journalism . The bi-partisan frustration that has greeted CNN 's coverage of the 2012 race this week is , in a sense , a sign that they are doing their jobs . <p> As the only cable news channel that has not picked sides in this election , CNN has a unique lens with which to cover these conventions . In Tampa and in Charlotte , we will give both parties an opportunity to showcase their platforms while also asking tough questions of Republicans and Democrats . Coverage of the conventions will dominate our air over two weeks as CNN 's deep bench of anchors , political reporters and analysts help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " CNN has bet on the idea that Americans will ultimately favor nonpartisan political coverage . Now , they 're making it their primary selling point , " writes Byers . <p> This is certain to generate a hearty chortle from partisans on the left and the right who , in the last alone , have ample evidence to prove that CNN 's coverage has been anything but " unbiased . " <p> Conservatives certainly do not have to reach far back in the archives to find a few examples of frustrating bias . On Monday night , Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich hammered prime time host Piers Morgan for asking why , in his estimation , Republican policies focus primarily on " looking after the very wealthy in America . " Gingrich wondered , smiling through the predictability of it all , why Morgan sounded like an " extension of the Obama campaign . " <p> " I do n't want to sound disrespectful , but I do wonder sometimes if you guys all get off on a little club and learn a brand new mantra and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fair question , when Morgan 's viewers are treated to talking points slightly less sophisticated than the average MoveOn.org sponsored protest sign . <p> Similarly , Romney campaign surrogate John Sununu was driven to telling Starting Point host Soledad O'Brien that she should affix an " Obama Bumper Sticker On Your Forehead " due to her repeating Democratic counterpoints to the charge that the Obama administration , through the Affordable Care Act , took billion away from the Medicare budget . <p> This , along with a charge that O'Brien referred to a statement from to Sen. Ron Wyden 's office published on Talking Points Memo to attack a conservative guest , have been cause for much consternation on the right over CNN 's treatment of Republican guests . <p> But those conservatives forget that CNN 's Democratic guests often get the same treatment , albeit from different on air personalities . <p> It would have been easy to let Wasserman Schultz get away with PolitiFact 's 2011 lie of the year and simply move along but Blitzer refused to do so .

Following a clip of Biden spitting the outrage back in the GOP 's face , Capehart weighed in . <p> " When I saw Andrea Saul 's statement about Vice President Biden 's comments , " he said , " I rolled my eyes , because we have been looking at a campaign , and in some instances the candidate himself , engaging in some somewhat racially insensitive things . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the President a food stamp president , " he continued . " You had Mitt Romney say to donors in Montana , after speaking to the NAACP saying how he would repeal Obamacare , saying if you want more free stuff vote for Obama .

Allen accusing the President of bringing back slavery ( Scarborough delivered the Breaking News that " Allen West is black .

" <p> " I understand why the Obama campaign would be angry , being yelled at , being lectured to by the Romney campaign about a ' campaign of divisiveness and hate , ' which is what they have been getting from the republican Party , and the Romney campaign in particular , for quite a long time .

When was the last time you heard a President accused of " stealing " for saving costs on Medicare , or any government program ? <p> The purpose of the feigned outrage at Joe Biden is n't actually to extract an apology , or even to shame him .

The document they 're relying on lists nine separate categories of disability , including blindness , deafness , partial or complete paralysis , missing extremities , and epilepsy , plus a tenth catch-all category .

The only problem is that the punch line was n't created by The Onion 's writing staff . It was forced on them by a mad man at the Empire State Building . <p> You see , yesterday , the satirical paper wrote a article jokingly celebrating the lack of " deadly shootings " in the nation in recent days . Today , they had to put at update . <p> Yesterday 's article was called " Nation Celebrates Full Week Without Deadly Mass Shooting .

We banded together and managed to go seven whole days without killing our fellow Americans in a senseless murdering spree ! " <p> Pitch perfect ( and pitch black ) satire from The Onion . But then came this morning . <p> However , The Onion ( the paper which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best , satirical responses to 9/11 ) was n't just going to remove the article .

There was another one about 20 blocks from here . So , party 's over . Sorry .

 websites you read last night , you might think MSNBC purposely avoided airing the speeches of several ethnic minority Republicans to further their progressive personalities ' narrative of the GOP being " racist " . <p> , Hot Air , The Daily Caller , and Town Hall were among the right-leaning websites who ran with the story that MSNBC had purposely neglected to cover the minority speeches . <p> We here at Mediaite also received many tips suggesting we check out these websites ' reports on the egregious racial move by MSNBC . One reader wrote that " MSNBC has proven they are the sic , and yet Mediaite refuses to present this fact ? " and implored us to read about it " all over the internet ; you look silly ignoring it .

 Todd : ' Democrats Wish They Had The Diversity ' Of The GOP <p> NBC News ' Chief White House Correspondent Chuck Todd appeared on Morning Joe on Thursday where he gave voice to the counterintuitive observation that the Republican Party has showcased a diverse array of speakers at this year 's convention that the Democratic party only wishes it had .

However , " as the elite East Coast , Harvard-educated creator of RomneyCare started to run in the most conservative Republican field in history , Romney realized the terrible truth : he had built himself the wrong way .

Stewart rebutted Romney by running clips of conservatives saying , less than six months after Obama was inaugurated , that he was already a failure .

 Saturday morning , MSNBC host Melissa Harris-Perry grew visibly frustrated over a guest 's assertion that the " big thing " missing in the President 's " you did n't build that speech " was an emphasis on taking risks , raising her voice and slamming down on her desk as she gave an impassioned rebuttal insisting that , no , the real risk is in being poor in America . <p> " What is riskier than living poor in America ?

Another guest pointed out a New York Times cover image of a black man laying back in an otherwise empty-looking New Orleans shelter , which she interpreted as an attempt to give an example of a " lazy person " living off others ' work . <p> Later on in the show , Harris-Perry offered an apology for " losing my temper earlier , " adding that it 's been a particularly hard week .

 of the United Nations General Assembly in a time of global crisis , President Barack Obama opted to legitimize the growing chorus of critics who condemn America 's provocative right of free speech .

This is an equivalency between what Obama views as equally condemnable religious slanders committed by malefactors on all sides . <p> That moment did not call for equivocation . When throngs of frustrated Muslims crowd Arab streets calling for America to rethink its commitment to free speech , when foreign governments demand Washington act to imprison individuals who exercise their constitutional rights however distasteful they may subjectively appear to some and when American diplomatic officials are in fear for their life , the President of the United States was obliged to defend this country 's guiding principles . As if he was unaware , those principles are under immediate threat . <p> President Obama chose instead to offer an excuse for his fellow citizens ' behavior in this statement .

 week after the terrorist attacks of September 11th , 2001 , Bill Maher made controversial comments on his ABC late-night talk show that undoubtedly led to the cancellation of the program and his eventually moving to HBO . <p> During a debate about terrorism , Maher disagreed with President George W. Bush 's characterization of the terrorists as " cowards " noting that " we " ( the U.S. military ) have been the cowards for remotely bombing countries while the terrorists stayed in the very planes that crashed into the World Trade Center and the Pentagon . <p> " We have been the cowards , lobbing cruise missiles from 2,000 miles away .

Look at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guys who were willing to give their life ; none of them backed out . All of them slammed themselves into pieces of concrete . These are warriors . <p> In that light , it 's fascinating that Maher became the subject of so much controversy while D'Souza was spared .

" <p> Just last month , Maher had D'Souza on his HBO show and confronted him over this . He told the conservative author how " it could have been helpful " if during the national firestorm over his remarks , D'Souza had stood up to defend him since the two of them were originally just agreeing on the air . <p> D'Souza shot back that Maher 's real troubles were the result of his including the United States military in his comments something D'Souza explicitly did not do .

 fiscal crisis bearing down on the nation and the need for closed-door negotiations and face-saving compromises for squeezed members of Congress never more apparent , President Barack Obama has embarked on yet another political campaign . This time , he is agitating for public support for increased tax rates on the nation 's high-income earners as part of a comprehensive resolution to the fiscal cliff . But higher tax rates is the only policy prescription the president campaigned on in 2012 if he has any mandate whatsoever from his victory , it is for higher taxes . Why then does Obama have to mount yet another campaign ? For one , the path of stump speeches and pushing hash tags on Twitter is far easier than acting as a sober and authoritative executive behind closed doors . <p> Obama 's perpetual campaign has begun to assume some familiar characteristics . The president has already mobilized a tread worn social media campaign and will hit the road to stump Philadelphia and it 's collar counties in Pennsylvania . Surely , the president hopes those rallies will dominate the airwaves and increase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watch . <p> The White House applied similar tactics when they sought to extend the payroll tax cut and raise the debt ceiling limit in 2011 . <p> Campaigning is comfortable territory for politicians and it is an especially cozy place for President Obama to occupy he is an extraordinary campaigner and has spent the majority of his political career on the trail seeking one or the other public office . But is this an effective tool for governing ? One need only look at Obama 's accomplishments in his first term to determine that it is not . <p> The president did not need to campaign to pass the stimulus act his party 's electoral mandate after the 2008 elections was broad enough and the financial crisis so dire that virtually any measure the president advocated for would have been passed . The president did , however , need to push hard to pass his health care reform law a program which remains deeply unpopular and whose future is forever in doubt . <p> The only reassurance that Democrats who support the Affordable Care Act have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , dramatically amended ) by a future Republican administration or GOP-dominated Congress is that broad entitlement programs is rarely repealed after it is fully enacted because vulnerable members of the public become dependent on those programs . Those who hold this view cite the legislative accomplishments of President Lyndon Johnson 's " Great Society " to support this thesis . But Democrats who idolize Johnson and seek parallels between the 36th president and the 44th have few to choose from . <p> Johnson was a famously passionate negotiator and a dogged pursuer of legislative compromise so long as ultimate goals were agreed to at the end of the day . The tails of his tireless efforts to strike deals between members of his party and Republicans in Congress ( some of whom he had better relationships with ) remain legendary . <p> Numerous accounts , notably those of reporter Bob Woodward in The Price of Politics , suggest that Obama is more likely to alienate his opponents in a tense negotiation than to win them over . Woodward noted that Vice President Joe Biden was the administration 's link @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were convened in Obama 's first term .

Such tactics are impediments to real compromise , but these are the tools of Obama 's first resort . <p> Republicans have signaled their willingness to compromise by increasing tax rates on high earners and Democrats have begun to see the light on the need for dramatic reforms to entitlement programs . But the willingness to compromise does not automatically translate into a forthcoming bargain .

" <p> On Wednesday 's edition of The Five , during a discussion of the controversy that erupted from Bob Costas ' commentary on Jovan Belcher 's murder of girlfriend Kasandra Perkins and subsequent suicide , co-host Dana Perino tried to steer the discussion around to violence against women , saying that the gun discussion " skirts the issue that women are victims of violence all the time .

" <p> Finney referenced a similar discussion from MSNBC 's The Cycle last week , in which S.E.

Cupp 's commentary , " I had to live through somebody saying that it was not the gun that hurt Jovan Belcher 's girlfriend , but it was domestic violence . Guns escalate anger and escalate situations . They are the most efficient killing machines we have . Yes , there are other things that we use to kill , but Bob Costas , and for once Jason Whitlock , was absolutely right to say allowing this gun culture is problematic for all of us .

 Air Acquired By Salem Communications <p> CPAC has n't even officially started and already its making news . Mediaite has learned that leading center-right web site Hot Air has been acquired by Salem Communications for an undisclosed sum . Sources close to the deal claim that Michelle Malkin , the conservative pundit and sole owner of Hot Air , has been in talks with Salem for some time , but the announcement was timed to coincide with the Conservative Political Action Conference , which opens tomorrow in Washington D.C. <p> Hot Air is one of the biggest , most influential conservative sites on the Web and was launched on April 24 , 2006 , with Michelle Malkin as founder/CEO ( though she remains editorially focused on her own blog MichelleMalkin.com and her own writing and television appearances . ) Hot Air is managed on a day-to-day basis by editors Ed Morrissey and the mysterious AllahPundit , who are reported to be part of the deal in the sale of to Salem , and absolutely essential to the core value of Hot Air . We are told that , from a user @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the change in ownership . <p> Last Fall , Mediaite cited Hot Air as one the Top 25 most influential blogs on the Internet . This is what we had to say at the time : <p> As Mediaite 's Tommy Christopher , a personal friend of Morrissey 's , wrote in the preface of a recent interview with him , Morrissey " does n't jump on every right-wing meme that comes along , which makes the battles he does choose that much more resonant , " which is as true of his Hot Air stewardship as it was of his earlier work . At Captain 's Quarters , he made a name for himself mixing passion with nuance , dissecting what he saw as bad arguments with a scalpel . It did n't hurt that he had a hand in taking down the Canadian government , thanks to a big scoop on a scandal plaguing the ruling Liberal Party that Canadian news outlets were gagged from reporting . All this while working full-time as a call center manager . <p> is a shadowier figure ; in an era @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his insistence on keeping a pseudonym has an anachronistic , early 2000s feel to it . Like Morrissey , he made his name on a possibly scandal he was one of the small handful of conservative bloggers whose investigative work led CBS to repudiate a set of documents of uncertain authenticity that were critical of Bush 's National Guard service record . At Hot Air as before , he distinguishes himself from the often strident political blogosphere by maintaining a sense of humor and displaying a keen wit . <p> Salem Communication defines itself as a leading U.S. radio broadcaster , Internet content provider , and magazine and book publisher targeting audiences interested in Christian and family-themed content and conservative values . Perhaps their most relevant property to this transaction is Townhall.com which claims itself to be the #1 conservative website . The " About Us " section of its website claims " Townhall.com pulls together political commentary and analysis from over 100 leading columnists and opinion leaders , research from 100 partner organizations , conservative talk-radio and a community of millions of grassroots conservatives .

 ' I Lost Track Of My Buddhist Teachings ' <p> At today 's press conference , Tiger Woods made specific note of how he lost what he 'd been taught having been raised Buddhist by his mother . When news of Tiger Woods affairs broke , some questioned his faith and spirituality , most notably , Fox News analyst Brit Hume actively suggested that Tiger would be better off forsaking Buddhism for the more " redemptive " and " forgiving " Christianity . What do we know about the redemptive <p> First a video clip of Tiger discussing his faith during his press conference <p> A guiding principle of Buddhism is Karma the law that guides our lives and acts as the basic social contract for humanity . From Buddhanet , Karma is defined thusly : <p> Karma is the law that every cause has an effect , i.e. , our actions have results . This simple law explains a number of things : inequality in the world , why some are born handicapped and some gifted , why some live only a short life . Karma underlines the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present actions . How can we test the karmic effect of our actions ? The answer is summed up by looking at ( 1 ) the intention behind the action , ( 2 ) effects of the action on oneself , and ( 3 ) the effects on others . <p> What else do we know about what Buddha teach ? The basic concepts in Buddhism can be summed up by the Four Noble Truths and the Noble Eightfold Path . Also from : <p> * What is the First Noble Truth ? <p> The first truth is that life is suffering i.e. , life includes pain , getting old , disease , and ultimately death . We also endure psychological suffering like loneliness frustration , fear , embarrassment , disappointment and anger . This is an irrefutable fact that can not be denied . It is realistic rather than pessimistic because pessimism is expecting things to be bad . lnstead , Buddhism explains how suffering can be avoided and how we can be truly happy . <p> * What is the Second Noble Truth ? <p> The second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We will suffer if we expect other people to conform to our expectation , if we want others to like us , if we do not get something we want , etc . In other words , getting what you want does not guarantee happiness . Rather than constantly struggling to get what you want , try to modify your wanting . Wanting deprives us of contentment and happiness . A lifetime of wanting and craving and especially the craving to continue to exist , creates a powerful energy which causes the individual to be born . So craving leads to physical suffering because it causes us to be reborn . <p> * What is the Third Noble Truth ? <p> The third truth is that suffering can be overcome and happiness can be attained ; that true happiness and contentment are possible . lf we give up useless craving and learn to live each day at a time ( not dwelling in the past or the imagined future ) then we can become happy and free . We then have more time and energy to help others . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Noble Truth ? <p> The fourth truth is that the Noble 8-fold Path is the path which leads to the end of suffering . <h> UN launches new 
 Man , the Mystery , the Secretary of the Treasury <p> In the March issue of Vogue , contributing editor Rebecca an interview with Timothy Geithner , Secretary of Treasury . Perhaps it seems ironic even wrong to place " the man responsible for crafting much of the bailout " next to a Prada bag , but Johnson 's article provides a refreshing , humanizing peek into Geithner 's life . Not just his closet . <p> And right now , that 's what just what Geithner needs . Since he assumed his post as captain of a sinking ship , he has received such negative flack that his own mother began to watch TV on mute . In response , Geithner emotionally shut down , constructing a steel facade that let him deal with the criticism hurled his way while simultaneously establishing legislation to save our wallets . He became hated , misunderstood . <p> " I understand that people want to understand you and get a feel for who you are , " Geithner told Vogue , " but it 's hard to do that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Such overwhelming abuse and disconnect has the potential to complicate an already messy job , and this article seems to be Geithner 's attempt at redemption . Johnson 's piece captures Geithner as a whole , delving into his normally private personal life and making him utterly likable . <p> For example , Tim Geithner has a Kindle ! He grew up in India , Africa and Thailand , and there 's even a picture of little Timmy Geithner playing baseball in India . He makes dinner , barefoot , in his parents ' Cape cod summer house and , when he comes to New York City , he does n't think he the Secretary of the Treasury can get a table at the " popular " places . <p> When the Daily Show filmed their clip exploring Geithner 's issue selling his home , they scared the crap out of Geithner 's kids , who were home alone , and that is one of the few times Geithner has expressed visible rage . And his flawed tax returns that emerged after his appointment ? Only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his complicated , international taxes with TurboTax . Sure , he probably should have hired someone . But who does n't try to save a few bucks where you can ? <p> Johnson 's piece paints Geithner as refreshing , full of integrity and humble , giving him a Vogue sparkle that makes him , well , lovable . Indeed , that seems to be Johnson 's goal ; she sprinkles the concept of popularity throughout the piece and , by the end , effectively confirms our greatest fear : high school is never over . <h> Italy convicts Google

 Vanity Fair Writer with Profanity , Cup of Coffee ? <p> Daily Intel 's Jessica Pressler dug a pretty explosive anecdote out of a James Fair article Taibbi 's exploits publishing Exile magazine in 1990 's Russia , and now it 's making the rounds on blogs and Twitter . According to Verini , Taibbi reacted to some criticism with a meltdown worthy of Christian Bale . Verini should have known trouble was brewing when Taibbi threw coffee on him , but it did n't end there . <p> I have some questions about this story , but let 's take this a step at a time . describes how he showed up late for lunch with an Taibbi , to get some material for the article : <p> I mentioned some of the Exile pieces of his I planned to write about , and he said , " That was covered in the book . " I told him yes , that was true , but the book had been published in 2000 , and , frankly , I did n't think it was very good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said . <p> " No , I did n't think so , " I said . <p> " My book ? " he said . <p> " Yes , the Exile book . I thought it was redundant and discursive and you guys left out a lot of the good stuff you did , " I said . <p> At this , Taibbi 's mouth turned down and his eyes narrowed . <p> So far , I 'm with Taibbi on this . My mouth would " turn down , " too ( some people would just call that " frowning " ) , if some guy I barely wanted to meet showed up late and told me I was doing him this favor because my work sucked . <p> " Fuck you , " he snarled , <p> That 's about right . <p> " Fuck you , " he snarled , and then picked up his mug from the table , threw his coffee at me , and stormed out . <p> Wow , he went from zero to Joe Pesci in Goodfellas like that . Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but here 's where the story gets a little dubious for me : <p> The restaurant was packed with customers , and they all turned to watch as I sat there , stunned , coffee dripping from my face . The waiter arrived with the milkshake Taibbi had ordered . <p> After Verini 's deconstruction of Taibbi 's scowl , there just seems to be something missing here . Like the part where he runs around the restaurant , screaming " My EYES ! " Was it an iced coffee ? That 's an important detail . <p> Here 's another question : At this point , why is your headline still " Lost Exile , " and not " Matt Taibbi Me With a Hot Beverage ? " <p> But , I digress . Verini then follows Taibbi , who just threw coffee on him , out of the restaurant to try and talk him down : <p> After wiping myself off a bit , I went outside , where Taibbi was putting on his coat , and asked him to calm down and come back into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beside himself with rage . <p> " Fuck you ! " he yelled . " Did you bring me here to insult me ? Who are you ? What have you ever written ? Fuck you ! " I tried to talk to him , but gave up when he walked away . I went back inside , paid the bill , left , and began walking up Sixth Avenue . Halfway up the block , I turned around , and Taibbi was behind me . <p> " Are you following me ? , " I asked . He walked toward me , raising his arms as though preparing to throttle me or take a swing . <p> " I still have n't decided what I 'm going to do with you ! " he said . <p> " Are you kidding ? , " I asked . <p> ... But the anger in Taibbi 's eyes was genuine , and , after some more glaring , he fumed off . That was the last I saw of him . <p> So , the guy just threw coffee on you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ healing powers or something , and now he appears on the street like Nosferatu , and you do n't give him a ? Call a cop ? <p> The really weird part is that Taibbi then ended up participating in the article anyway , via email , and none of those emails apparently said " BTW , sorry I assaulted you and stalked you like human prey afterwards . I 'm switching to Sanka . " <p> The whole thing sounds like one of those apocryphal tales , like the Jake story . I do n't know Taibbi , I only met him once . He was in Philadelphia doing a segment on the Democratic primary for Real Time . We shot the breeze for about half an hour , and he sure did n't seem like a hair-trigger psychopath . In fact , he kind of annoyed me by smiling too much . Am I a clown ? Do I amuse you ? <p> Do n't get me wrong , I 'm not saying Verini made it up . How could he ? It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I tried ( unsuccessfully ) to get ahold of Taibbi to get his side of the story .

 Like To Bizarrely Criticize Your Lack Of Manliness <p> Criticizing the American public for the role its own immaturity plays in political gridlock is all the rage lately . Jacob it in Slate early last month , ( rightly ) pointing out it 's unrealistic to expect government to tackle the biggest issues facing the country while also getting smaller . And Evan it in the latest Newsweek , similarly blaming a " culture of entitlement . " ( Still , Weisberg and Thomas might allow that there 's a bit more those in Washignton could be doing to work together and get things done . ) But the most ... interesting " cultural immaturity " critique also comes from this week 's Newsweek , in the person of George Will . Will 's argument : that men are getting more and more immature and less and less , well , manly . Now , Will might even be right about this , but his methods in making his point leave something to be desired . <p> He gets off to a questionable start when he bemoans men " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Center reports that 28 percent of wives between ages 30 and 44 have more education than their husbands , whereas only 19 percent of husbands in the same age group have more education than their wives . Twenty-three percent of men with some college education earn less than their wives . In law , medical , and doctoral programs , women are majorities or , if trends continue , will be . <p> One might look at that and think , " Wow good job , women . " George Will did not think this . In fact , there seems to be a bit of " **31;0;TOOLONG " undercurrent here , even if , as is likely , he did n't mean for there to be . Also , " twenty-three percent " is that really a cause for alarm of some kind ? ( Taking that a step further , is a subset of men earning less than their wives a cause for alarm either ? ) And re : his last point , he 's getting all worked up about something that 1 ) has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does n't sound like such a bad thing . The problems continue when he talks about marriage : <p> A recent study found that 55 percent of men 18 to 24 are living in their parents ' homes , as are 13 percent of men 25 to 34 , compared to 8 percent of women . <p> 18 to 24 ? Is n't that awfully young to start getting judgmental ? A lot of those parents ' on the younger end of that spectrum are kids commuting to college , no ? Remember , college ? The thing he was just saying not enough guys are going to ? And ... 18 ? Forget college , most people are still in high school at that age . And the wheels are about to fall off . <p> If you wonder what has become of manliness , Penn State historian Gary Cross says , note the differences between Cary Grant and Hugh Grant , the former , dapper and debonair , the latter , a perpetually befuddled boy . <p> Ah yes , Cary Grant and Hugh Grant . Very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s . Another instructive example : think of the differences between Theodore Roosevelt and this delicious roast beef sandwich . One was our 26th President , a Rough Rider , a passionate hunter a true man 's man . The other ? None of these ! What is happening to manhood ? OK , so Cary and Hugh are both handsome leading men , they 're both English-born but would n't , say , George Clooney be a better modern-day Cary Grant comparison as far as suaveness , dapper-ness , etc. is concerned ? Or would that just defeat the purpose of the comparison ? <p> Permissive parenting , Cross says , made children less submissive , and the decline of deference coincided with the rise of consumer and media cultures celebrating the indefinite retention of the tastes and habits of childhood . The opening of careers to talented women has coincided with the attenuation of male role models in popular culture : In 1959 , there were 27 Westerns on prime-time television glamorizing male responsibility . <p> There is probably more " permissive parenting " than ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about how there are n't any Westerns on TV anymore to tech men how to be real men is anyone 's guess .

 Rove wants to travel to a simpler time . With the release of his new book slated to drop this Monday , Courage and Consequence : My Life as a Conservative in the Fight , Rove is making the 2000 presidential election an issue again by admitting to some of his worst mistakes as the ' Architect ' of Bush 's win , and accusing a former Gore staffer ( and , perhaps unintentionally , a major media ally ) of putting into motion the news story that may have led to the Florida recount . <p> Perhaps the biggest reveal comes when Rove candidly admits that the biggest mistake of the first George W. Bush presidential campaign was allowing the story of the former president 's 1976 Maine DUI arrest break five days before the election . Not that it was Rove 's fault entirely : in the book he accuses Gore campaign press secretary Chris Lehane of being responsible for releasing it . Lehane , for those of you who need a refresher , was raised in Maine and had ties to both local politicians and lawyers , including @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tipster to release the story to the media . The unlikely news accomplice ? A then up-and-coming cable news outlet called Fox News , who broke the story and , according to Rove , cost Bush five states that could have canceled out the electoral college value of Florida . The excerpt via Politico : <p> " Before the news broke , we were up ... in Maine ... Bush went on to lose Maine ... If Bush did drop 2 percent nationally in the vote because of the DUI revelation , then it probably cost him four additional states that he lost by less than 1 percent New Mexico , Iowa , Wisconsin , and Oregon .

 In Great Detail , On MSNBC Anchors Of The Past <p> Keith Olbermann has n't appeared on MSNBC since March 1 ( and has n't anchored Countdown since February 24 ) while he cares for his ailing father . <p> But that does n't mean he 's disappeared from the web , where he 's been feuding with ESPN 's Bill Simmons , and last night took time to explain , in great detail , the history of some former MSNBC anchors . <p> It 's hard to really see where this all began , but Keith Olbermann responded to an interview between Cenk Uygur and Jesse Ventura with a lengthy blog post on Daily Kos last night . Then he followed it up with 18 more comments to fellow Kos commenters . All concern his history with MSNBC , Ventura 's , Ashleigh Banfield 's time at the network ( and leaving the network ) and ... more . <p> Here 's a taste of the initial blog post : <p> The other landmarks of shaking the fog of propaganda followed as they did for most of us .

Why not ? He was popular , recognizable , intelligent , a television veteran , and a recent ex-Governor . And so he was signed , met the advertisers with us ( I recall his displeasure that Chris , Scarborough , Lester Holt and I were all a little taller than he was ) , and they set about developing the show ...

One day she even came in , all smiles , we reminisced , I commiserated with her about her impending life after MSNBC , and I went out and worked at a desk somewhere . <p> Having been given a lot of notice ( maybe as much as a year ) she made her speech about Iraq . Then they formally notified her , yes , as planned , they would not be renewing her her a new contract . <p> So , was she " not renewed after giving her Iraq speech " ? Yes . Was she told they were n't going to renew her before she gave her Iraq speech ? Yes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because I was critical of the war " story is a lot better than the " they did n't renew my contract " story . <p> And was there an attempt to lurch right at MS ? Sure as hell was ! They signed Michael Savage , did n't they ? And they fired him , too . But kept me . <p> As Banfield surveyed developments like these , she began to question the state of cable news : Had the line between journalism and entertainment grown irreversibly blurred ? Her unease deepened with the coverage of the Iraq War in March and April of 2003 , which she thought celebrated the triumphs of war at the expense of the scarcely visible tragedies . These concerns formed the basis of a lecture Banfield delivered at Kansas State University on April 24 , 2003 , a couple of weeks after the fall of Baghdad . The lecture caused a furor especially among her bosses at NBC , who publicly rebuked her : " We are deeply disappointed and troubled by her remarks , and will review her comments with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comments would severely damage her career . <p> And so on . <p> Olbermann also wrote Donohue : " Phil Donahue got cancelled .

What I have here before me is a 300-page spiral bound book . As in , paper . As in , in 1998 , Media Metrix printed out thousands of 300-page books to give to people to deepen their understanding of the Web . I considered various analogies here , and settled on this one . <p> So , join me as we walk twelve years backward into the halcyon days of the World Wide Web . <p> The IntroductionThe modern usefulness of the introduction can be summarized by the image at left .

 media has squeezed every last eyeball from the year of frenzied interest in health care reform , it appears that Crazy Republicans are , at the very least , the interim replacement . A supporting player in the health care drama , it looks like they have become the story now . <p> The poll has been fairly ubiquitous on cable news shows the past few days . The numbers are scary , indeed . believe the President is a socialist , although Harris did n't do anything to verify that respondents knew what that word meant . <p> The real sizzler , though , is the who believe he was n't born in the US , and the who say he " may be the Antichrist . " There 's no way to tell if there 's any overlap , so it could be that up to of Republicans believe the President was either born in another country , or that he was born here , but of a jackal . <p> My first instinct was that the cablers were paraphrasing , and cooking the numbers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these were straight true/false questions , no " unsure " responses . <p> The poll 's methodology is not rock solid . While the sample size is more than adequate at 2,320 ( scientific pollsters frequently use samples in the 500 range ) , the poll is an interactive survey , as ABC 's Gary out , " done among people who sign up to click through questionnaires via the Internet in exchange for points redeemable for cash and gifts not a probability sample . " <p> Others have attacked the way the questions were asked , and they have a point . For example , if you believe in an Antichrist , end-times theology states that it could be pretty much anyone . Hell , I 'd probably score higher than on this poll . <p> As for " doing many of the things Hitler did , " aside from slaughtering millions and admiring his ball , who does n't ? Taken literally , it 's a tough statement to disagree with , especially when you 've got Bonus Web Bucks riding on it . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessarily weaker than others of its kind . This kind of interactive polling is relied upon all the time for market research and the like . It 's just not as solid as other , more expensive polling methods . Zogby International , for example , uses similar methods . <p> Even if you grant a pretty wide margin of error , though , people will assume that where there 's smoke , there 's fire . The Republican leadership 's willingness to flirt with ideas like the birth certificate conspiracy , or their insistence that health care reform is an " apocalypse , " will appear to be bearing fruit . <p> Methodology aside , the battle to paint Republicans as unhinged loons has already been won , as this poll has been splashed across TV and computer screens as a series of bullets , straight to the heart of conservative credibility . The next stop ? Gun rights rallies scheduled for April 19 , the anniversary of both the end of the 1993 siege in Waco , and the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing . Liberal cable hosts like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an alarm . <p> How can conservatives combat the new narrative ? That 's a tough question . Once people start looking at you like you 're crazy , it 's tough to shake that impression . The louder you protest your sanity , the crazier you look .

 F-Bomb Version Of Schoolhouse Rock 's " I 'm Just A Bill " <p> Rarely does a comedy bit feel both inevitable and really funny , but that just happens to be the case in the following clip . By now nearly everyone has heard Vice President Joe Biden 's " this is a big f-ing deal " comment to President Obama that was picked up by hot mics during the ceremonial signing of the recently passed health care bill . But it took clever comedic minds at Late Night with Jimmy Fallon to present that wonderful gaffe in the proper context : via the classic Schoolhouse Rock short " I 'm Just A Bill .

 He Was Fired Because Of His ' Waterloo ' Column <p> It did seem a tad coincidental . Just days after penning his much talked about ' Waterloo ' column ( as in HCR was the GOP 's Waterloo ) conservative thinker and former Bush administration official was fired from his job at the American Enterprise Institute , where he 'd been since 2003 . The firing apparently came as much as a surprise to Frum as it did to everyone else . No room for reality checks on the right ? went much of the speculation . <p> Frum , who was supposed to appear on Countdown last night and canceled , unloaded to Politco 's Mike Allen instead , asserting that it was " donor pressure " following the ' Waterloo ' post that led to his dismissal .

 Politically-Charged " Window Seat " Taken Off Of YouTube <p> Singer/songwriter Erykah Badu has come under fire recently for her latest music video " Window Seat , " which shows the African-American songstress stripping down around the site of JFK 's assassination . Along with being charged by the Dallas police for a misdemeanor in public nudity , " Window Seat " has also been pulled off of YouTube , despite the fact that all the R-rated portions were blurred out in the video . We can understand the legality of charging Badu ( which our sister site Gossip Cop reported on yesterday ) : after all , there were public complaints that she exposed herself to children during the taping of the video , but why is YouTube taking such a hard stance on one of the more innocuous displays of nakedness on their site ? <p> One ca n't help but be reminded of Lady Gaga 's " Telephone " controversy several weeks ago , where CNN reported that MTV had pulled the video from its channel due to its graphic nature ( though that rumor was later revealed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Youtube , and was far more sexual than the statement Badu was making with her " Window Seat " politics . <p> Badu claimed that the video which was all done in one take represented the power of " group think " and as of Thursday said on her Twitter that no one has pressed charges .

 Fox News ' ' Bogus ' Coverage Of ACORN <p> Rachel Maddow may well on her way to establishing herself as the preeminent mainstream media watchdog after last night . Her calm , thorough , twelve minute evisceration ( sorry Jon Stewart , but it was ) of the ACORN scandal was a far more damning commentary on the laziness and gullibility of the media and the questionable intentions of Fox News in general than it was an expose of how James O'Keefe et al . faked much of their now infamous report with " highly selective editing of reality . " <p> Using last week 's California attorney general 's report on the ACORN tapes as well as the unedited video Maddow compares the news that was reported , primarily on Fox , but eventually elsewhere also , with what actually happened .

Turns out she was encouraging Giles not to give up looking for financing for housing . <p> Maddow , who does n't let ACORN off the hook for its other legal misdemeanors , reserves her most damning commentary for Fox : <p> I know it must shock you but it turns out Fox News was not giving its viewers an accurate portrayal of exactly how these two activists portrayed themselves when they went into the ACORN office ... the huge tide of negative publicity that followed these tapes and the coverage they got on Fox , wall-to-wall for months , was bull-pucky .

 Dangers Of Deadspin 's Comments Section <p> Yesterday , Sarah Silverman participated in a chat in Deadspin 's comments section . The chat was the culmination of " Deadspin Comedy Week , " a series of pieces designed to generate buzz for Silverman 's new book , " The Bedwetter . " <p> Although Deadspin is a sports blog , they appeared to be fully behind Silverman 's new book . There were excerpts , guest posts by other comedians , and banner ads prominently displaying her visage . <p> But the highlight of the campaign was going to be a chat at the end of the week . Silverman , the notoriously abrasive comedian , was going to go head to head with Deadspin 's commenters , notoriously abrasive in their own right . Much like Silverman 's show , the chat had the potential to be racist , homophobic , and very entertaining . <p> It did n't turn out that way . <p> Silverman , who had clearly not been given any lesson how to use Gawker 's somewhat complicated comments section , had trouble replying to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the chat 's first few minutes , Deadspin editor AJ , " Worst chat ever ? Worst chat ever . " <p> It did n't get much better from there . Silverman , in addition to having trouble using the comment section 's features , seemed uninterested in the chat itself . As this became apparent , the Deadspin commenters turned on her , criticizing her past movie roles and bringing up her relationship with Jimmy Kimmel . Those were some of the milder shots . <p> Meanwhile , Silverman either ignored the more malicious comments or did n't see them . Either way , Daulerio 's frustration over her perceived indifference grew . At one point he commented , " She 's dumb . She wo n't see this question . Sorry . I hate her . " <p> A short time later , Silverman left , apparently unaware that the chat had gone sour . Following the chat , Daulerio made a follow-up post summarizing it . It opened with this : <p> From dealing with her handlers or her publicist or assistant or handbag holder or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sarah Silverman 's Literary Life , this live chat , dear loathsome readers , sucked . <p> " I trusted her people too much , " Daulerio told us when we spoke to him last night . " They said they 'd sit her down and show her how to use the comments . That obviously did n't happen . " <p> In addition , Silverman 's perceived disinterest in the chat angered Daulerio . According to him , the " Comedy Week " had been discussed for months . Silverman 's editor David Hirshey also happened to be a Deadspin contributor , and he facilitated the partnership ( Daulerio was quick to point out that Hirshey was n't part of the contingent responsible for prepping Sarah on the ways of Gawker commenting ) . <p> The payoff was supposed to be the chat between Silverman and Deadspin 's commenters .

 Mean Parody Of Controversial Lane Bryant Ad <p> Yesterday , Lane Bryant , the clothing store chain that caters to plus-sized women , slammed ABC and Fox for refusing to air a commercial for their new lingerie line . Since the commercial had nothing in it that a thousand Victoria 's Secret ads before it did n't , the company accused the networks of discriminating against larger women . It 's a fairly interesting story that speaks to the shallow nature of our society and Christi Paul and Brooke Anderson ( two women who have never shopped at a Lane Bryant ) tackled it earlier this afternoon on CNN .

And the parody had a fairly mean joke inside it that must have gotten past the eyes at CNN . <p> Please enable Javascript to watch . <p> For those of you that missed it ( we 're not sure how you could have ) the difference between the original and the parody that CNN aired comes at the point where the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she gets a calendar reminder telling her to " Meet Dan for lunch , " and she sets off in her Lane Bryant lingerie for what we can only assume is going to be clothing optional mean .

 National Enquirer Wasting Its Shred Of Credibility On This Obama Story ? <p> Over the weekend the National Enquirer published an " exclusive " story that said President Barack Obama had had an affair with campaign worker Vera Baker back in 2004 . You can read the original Mediaite post here its updated post here and managing editor Colby Hall 's clarification here . And Dan Abrams ' comment here . <p> Shortly after the National Enquirer posted their " special investigation " Drudge picked it up and ran it as its lede story for the better part of 24 hours . Needless to say , the Drudge showcase guaranteed the story a level of attention it would not otherwise , and probably should n't , have received . <p> With that in mind , I want to focus on something I think was missed in the our original posts , which is why the National Enquirer opted to squander the little bit of credibility they had mustered as a result of their Pulitzer Prize eligible John Edwards story , and their fairly accurate prediction of the Tiger Woods debacle , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough holes in it to drive an army of Mack trucks through . <p> The short answer of course is sales . Newsstand sales , and online sales , otherwise known as page views , and you ca n't hit a bigger page view bonanza than a headline Drudge link . What 's interesting about this is that the Enquirer is standing by their story . <p> Here is an email we received yesterday from National Enquirer Web Editor Dick Siegel in response to Frances Martel 's second post about the story : <p> In reference to the online story which carries your Frances Martel by-line : http : <p> 1 . The ENQUIRER has NOT retracted the story http : 2 . The updated story was edited for clarity and the online copy is an abridged version of the original posting 3 . The reference to the hotel surveillance video you claim in your story that was omitted is in the online ENQUIRER posting 4 . The full unabridged story appears in this weeks Globe magazine cover date May 10 , 2010 pgs 30 , 31 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> So ! The Enquirer is standing by their shadily sourced story . And I mean seriously , shadily sourced : " An ENQUIRER reporter has confirmed the limo driver 's account the print version provides an expanded , if equally shady , anonymous account from said limo driver of the secret 2004 rendezvous and has also learned that on-site hotel surveillance video camera footage could provide indisputable evidence to the investigation . " Yeah , that 's a pretty big could . As in it could provide evidence that campaign workers stayed in the same hotel at Barack Obama in 2004 . As in , if we could get video evidence of Roswell , we might be able to prove the existence of aliens ( actually , I think that may have been a NE story ) . <p> Likely the most reliable part of this entire story is that " that top anti-Obama operatives are offering more than million to witnesses to reveal what they know about the alleged hush-hush affair . " Yes . I think it 's pretty much a guarantee that a whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot of money for some sort of proof ( video tape or otherwise ) that the president is not what he says he is . Duh . In political terms it 's referred to as " opposition research . " <p> Interestingly ( or maybe predictably ) , when I emailed Siegel back to ask him to comment on how the National Enquirer is following up on this story , and why the NE has suddenly decided to re-pursue it , or if we can expect the sort of photo evidence that accompanied the Edwards stories ? His only response was to confirm that I had the right link to the story . <p> The National Enquirer currently occupies a strange place at a very strange time in journalism . As has been noted by many others , their big score on the John Edwards story elevated them to the realm of possibly believable ( as opposed to grocery line time passer ) . And they followed this up by being proved right about Tiger Woods ... by Tiger Woods , but nevertheless it was a one-two punch they could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Edwards story and this one are striking . For one , the Edwards story was happening in real time and the NE was reporting it as such . They paid to have people follow Edwards round the clock . They took pictures . A lot . And published actual photos of Edwards and Rielle and the baby , together . It was this tenacity and documentation of the facts ( sordid though they were ) that convinced people the NE , despite their usual fare , should be made eligible for a Pulitzer . None of these things are true here . None . Zero . However , the fact they were right that one time injects enough of a shadow of a doubt to warrant a second glance at this story ( and likely make some pols just a tad nervous or a tad excited , depending ) and I imagine that second glance was just what they were banking on ( maybe literally ) . <p> Add to that the fact TMZ.com , the online prodigy of the type of ' journalism ' the NE pioneered , has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ add to that a cable and blogosphere that often operates ( aka , link baits ) in innuendo and suggestion , and what you have a perfect opportunity for the National Enquirer to plunk itself once again squarely into the news cycle , generate a gazillion page views , and hope that with all this blood in the water someone will bite . And the blue dress equivalent will appear . At least that 's my suspicion . Because otherwise this story is the political equivalent to an Elvis sighting , but even less reliable . <h> Spell It Out 
 ' at Center of Coverage of D.C. Crime Mystery Set for Trial <p> When a " ripped from the headlines " trial involving a dead lawyer , a gay " thruple " into kinky sex , and a bungled murder investigation begins May 10 in Washington , D.C. , the bulk of the trial coverage will likely be handled by four guys with a blog . <p> While the traditional media will be present for some of the trial , the four men who started the blog Who Murdered Robert Wone are set to provide continuing coverage and frequent updates of the obstruction of justice trial connected to the 2006 murder of Robert Wone , a married man found dead in the home of the gay men involved in a three-way relationship . <p> In an example of citizen journalism on steroids , the bloggers have immersed themselves into the investigation of Wone since they started the blog in December 2008 .

" We are n't a gay gadfly blog but instead have tried to be an unblinking observer inside the weave of the investigation . " <p> Sean Bugg , co-publisher of D.C.

Although MetroWeekly was one of the first media outlets on the scene in 2006 , he expects to use some of the blog 's coverage in shaping MetroWeekly 's reporting on the upcoming trial . <p> Brownstein says " we do n't really have a model since no one else has really done what we 've done , " but credits the work of the Chauncey Bailey Project as an example of other crime coverage done outside the traditional media . Unlike the institutional support and investigative reporters behind the investigation of the murder of Oakland Post editor Bailey in 2007 , the Robert Wone bloggers have no money and little experience in investigate reporting . <p> The bloggers expect to top 1,000,000 page views once the trial is over .

Each new filing in court ends up on the blog , where the memo , motion , or report is examined by the bloggers who are n't lawyers and their loyal readers . <p> While the blog is heavy on dissecting forensics reports and legal filings , it also focuses on Wone and his family . On the anniversary of the killing , the bloggers turned the blog over to friends and family of Wone who spent a week talking about his life and his work . <p> was an attorney with high-profile law firm Covington &amp; Burling and had just become general counsel at Radio Free Asia when he went to spend the night at the home of a college friend , Joseph Price , instead of driving home to his wife in the far Virginia suburbs of D.C.

The three men who lived in the house , including Price 's longtime partner and a third man who had joined the relationship , almost immediately lawyered up . <p> Because the story has dragged on for almost four years , coverage of the murder and investigation happens in fits and starts , Brownstein said . He credited the gay press and the legal press for staying on the story . <p> " There are allegations the police botched processing the crime scene and that evidence is missing . The case could come down to expert testimony . This all makes for a gripping narrative for any news outlet , especially one focused on the legal community , " Scarcella said , adding that the fact two lawyers were involved as the victim and a suspect initially spurred interest in the case . <p> The traditional press has also reported on the story , often with some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the beginning including an online-only opus in 2009 by crime reporter Paul Duggan . Just recently , Washingtonian magazine did a lengthy feature by Harry Jaffe focusing on Wone 's wife and the high-profile names involved in the case . <p> WaPo 's Local Editor Emilio Garcia-Ruiz emailed that the paper would " cover the trial the way we cover any major trial , " but decisions about coverage have not been made beyond that . Both of the city 's gay newspapers MetroWeekly and the Washington Blade are expected to provide coverage but not be in the courtroom for the whole trial . <p> " I did n't even watch Perry Mason as a kid , " Brownstein quipped when talking about his naivete about legal reporting and criminal investigations .

While the bloggers became interested because of the compelling nature of promising straight lawyer found dead in the home of a gay rights and his two lovers , they 've tried to avoid the sensational nature of the story . <p> " It was important for us to achieve credibility and that was done by approaching the investigation with a venere of journalistic integrity , " Brownstein says . While Brownstein said the three defendants are " one-degree of separation " from the bloggers given the small-town nature of Washington 's gay community , the bloggers did not know the defendants and the gay element of the story was not the thing that most interested them in the story . <p> The decision to start a blog came from their sense that the story just was n't being reported . While the story got a lot of play when the crime first took place , the men felt that the strange nature of the crime and the high-profile nature of the defendants and Wone would have resulted in more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was important that blog not be viewed as four gay guys trying to make a statement about a crime where the main defendants were gay .

I 'm sure there are more , but it seemed worthwhile to get this important piece of WHCD history officially on the books . <p> It should be noted , btw , that Cox did not coin the actual phrase " Nerd Prom , " just applied it to the WHCD .

 have released a poll today showing the various demographics that remain steadfast in their belief Pres. Barack Obama was not born in the United States . <p> The biggest surprise ? A third of these " birthers " seem totally fine with the idea that the President was n't born in America . <p> First , let 's figure out how many of these birthers there are . According to the poll , of Americans believe Obama was born abroad ( check out the results in chart form ) . Of those , say it 's just a " suspicion only . " Phrased another way ( " Where was Barack Obama born , as far as you know ? " ) , said the U.S. , while said another country and said they did n't know . <p> Ok , that 's a lot of birthers . But guess what some of the birthers really like Obama , despite him being from another country ! Washington Post 's Dave the stat : <p> The more interesting part of the poll is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in another country approve of his job performance , and 34 percent give him a favorable rating . That validates a theory of mine that many so-called birthers do n't actually hold Obama 's ( to them ) foreign-ness against him , or think it 's a way to oust him from the presidency . They have little information , they know he 's half African , and they jump to conclusions . <p> This sort of birther is echoes by another stat from the poll are Democrats , call themselves " liberal " and identified themselves as Obama VOTERS IN 2008 .

 just reported on some previously-unreleased FBI documents which contain fairly shocking allegations against the late Walter Cronkite , host of the CBS Evening News for 19 years and one of the most respected journalists of all time . The documents include the claims of a confidential informant who once told the FBI that Cronkite aided a group of student Vietnam War protesters by giving them advice and even going as far as to promise them CBS resources for their cause . <p> While it is well known that Cronkite was against the war ( in fact , his famous editorial against it in February of 1968 is often credited with turning the tide of public opinion against the war ) , the claims in the documents allege a heretofore unheard of connection between a political group and a news organization of the time .

The most stinging allegation is that Cronkite promised to rent an official CBS helicopter to fly Muskie to the event . <p> " Redacted told group he had been to CBS Channel Six in Orlando prior to meeting to speak to newsmen about Vietnam moratorium activities . Redacted related that while at TV station , Walter Cronkite , nationally known radio and television commentator , spoke to him by telephone for approximately forty five minutes and that Cronkite reportedly told redacted that CBS would have thirty six hours of coverage on Vietnam moratorium with " open mike " to give demonstrators a chance to be heard . Cronkite noted , according to redacted , that Senator Edmund Muskie would be in Orlando , Fla. , November 13 instant for Democratic fund raising dinner . According to redacted , Cronkite suggested that redacted attempt to Muskie to come sic to Cape Kennedy to speak at Kelly Park rally to be held November thirteen instant .

 Washington Post column today is more of a trend-spotter than a policy analysis , noting that the Republican " Class of ' 94 " that stormed in during Newt Gingrich 's Republican Revolution seems to have more sex scandals than most . " No fewer than 15 of the 73 elected in the landslide that year , " Milbank writes , " have entertained the nation with flaps that include messy divorces and a suspicious car accident . " In other words , the Class of ' 94 is bringing career-destroying sexy back . But did it ever leave ? <p> " With each passing year , the class notes for the famous House Republicans Class of ' 94 get more lurid , " he argues . Using yesterday 's Mark Souder scandal as a launch point , Milbank cites Mark Foley , Mark Sanford ( who won election to the House of Representatives in 1994 ) , and John Ensign as examples . He even throws in a couple of Congressmen involved in the Jack Abramoff scandal to add to the 15/73 number , though the closest thing to lewd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to don to court . He also takes a jab at former Libertarian presidential candidate Bob Barr for , well , being " socially libertarian . " When he tries to explain the why behind the scandals , however , he only focuses on sex scandals and uses logic that can apply to the political career of someone from any ideological background : <p> Yet millions of people live in the Washington area , and relatively few of us have adulterous relationships with married subordinates we have hired to assist us in broadcasts for Christian media outlets . That , and not this town 's " poisonous environment , " is why Souder is resigning . <p> Perhaps the problem is that lawmakers are spending too little time in Washington . In the old days , they moved their families here ; now they jet back and forth and focus on raising campaign money , straining marriages . That reality , combined with the sense of invincibility many lawmakers acquire , has ensnared more than a few of Souder 's classmates most of whom came to town with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ analysis open-ended , however , since he only gives that number in absolute terms . 15 out of 73 about , one in every five politicians does n't seem alarming , but rather par for the course for any other collection of politicians . I 'll admit that my perspective might be skewed from a lifetime in New Jersey , where we long for the righteous days of Jim McGreevey , but think of five names of any American public officials , and chances are at least one of them will be Rod Blagojevich or Larry Craig , or any politician with a sullied name . While part of this is publicity , some percentage of it must also be sheer number of corrupt politicians , from the days of the Teapot Dome Scandal to the rise and fall of Monica Lewinsky . <p> Centuries of political scandal have still not satiated the media 's interest in the topic , nor has it suppressed the desire to make it appear as if corruption werer a trend rather than a fact of life . Take , for example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To celebrate ( ? ) the release of former Ohio Congressman and current Ohio Congressional from jail , Newsweek 's " The Gaggle " blog officially declared that " Suddenly , Disgraced Politicians Are Cool Again " in September 2009 . For some reason , it was Traficant 's release from jail that made corruption a fashion statement , not the previous Year in Blago or the New Jersey arrests of 44 suspects in a corruption raid in July 2009 that stripped the town of Hoboken of it 's three-week-old mayor . It even ignored the fact that Traficant , a of sorts ( hair and all ) , and his shenanigans had not been making news for years before he was released from jail . <p> Milbank is absolutely correct in noting that there is something " lurid " about the Congressional Class of 1994 . There is something " lurid " about a number of all politicians in every capacity . In artificially extracting the history of the 1994 Congressional Republicans from the long-term political narrative , he fails to note that moral and legal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an issues Americans have consistently dealt with for centuries . <h> Running for Sheriff

 all the makings of an SNL sketch , but may actually be the best news BP has gotten in the Gulf of Mexico since an oil rig exploded there , leaving a gushing oil well open , almost a month ago . Academy Award-winning actor Kevin Costner and his brother , Dan , have been developing oil separation machines designed to respond to massive oil spills for 15 years . Thanks to BP , they 'll finally have the opportunity to test their technology . <p> The New York Timesis reporting that BP has approved six of the machines from Costner 's company , Ocean Therapy , for testing in the Gulf . The machines work like a centrifuge , using the oil 's larger density to separate it from the water . The water that comes out of the machine is purified .

" That 's the gist of the History Channel 's terrifying documentary , The Crumbling of America , which ran this morning just to offer some cheery fodder for a holiday weekend . The documenary is from 2009 , but it amidst the staggering damage of the BP oil spill it could not be more timely as the nation gapes at the massive catastrophe still unfolding in the Gulf and looks back on how it might have been prevented . <p> The happens after every the blame game and the finger-pointing of who should have known and why was n't this looked after but The Crumbling of America is ahead of that process for the nation 's bridges , roads , dams , tunnels , sewage systems and everything else that holds the country together , and it 's pretty damn scary . <p> The scariest part : Knowing that it will be largely ignored until the next catastrophe happens . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corrosion , and decades of deferred maintenance have conspired to bring America 's infrastructure down , " intones the voiceover who could well be doubling for the trailer for 2012 . <p> Take the dams . " There are 85 , 000 dams in the U.S. , " says the narrator , as the camera pans over a sparkling-blue sampling . " Four thousand of them are unsafe . And 1800 of those are high hazard dams dams that are likely to kill people if they fail . " We are informed that the number of unsafe high-hazard dams has quadrupled since 2001 . <p> Here 's some more to freak you out : <p> Inspections are critical ... and yet , states have cut inspection programs to the bone . In 2007 , the last year for which statistics are available , Texas had just 7 inspectors responsible for 7,400 dams . That 's over 1,050 dams per inspector . The state was only able to look at 239 dams . That same year , Iowa had one full-time and one part-time inspector . Overseeing 3,344 dams . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does n't even have an inspection agency to monitor its 2,000-plus dams . Adding to the danger are thousands of ' orphan dams ' those abandoned by corporations and private owners with no one left in charge . <p> Never mind the revolting dangers posed by a crumbling sewage system . I would not advise anyone to move to St. Louis any time soon . <p> I 'm not a horror flick person , so I never saw Wolf Creek . But this , about the Wolf Creek Dam in Kentucky , sounds pretty damn scary : <p> Five major dams in the eastern U.S. were also built on porous limestone in the 1930s . At the time , dam designers did n't understand the ramifications of porous foundations . But Wolf Creek may well be the most hazardous . If it failed , 6 million acre-feet of water in Lake Cumberland would pour into the Cumberland River , rushing downstream at 40 feet per second , and flooding towns and cities for hundreds of miles . 6 million acre feet is enough to cover the entire state of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be killed , and damage would run into the billions . <p> Ironically , The Crumbling of America goes on to map out how the overflow would be carried to the next urban center downstream : Nashville . It shows the doomsday Nashville flood scenario : " The heart of Music City , USA is 20 feet underwater . " It 's is shocking to see and meant to freak the watcher out except since this documentary was made , Nashville under water has happened . To middling media interest , thanks to other distractions . That does not bode well for media interest in covering these other infrastructure issues especially before they happen . Yawn . <p> The Crumbling of America goes into similarly scary detail on sewage ( " Nationwide , the United States has more than one million miles of sewage pipes ... and much of that vast system consists of heavily leaking pipes like these " ) , bridges ( " In the next 10 years , , , over of our bridges will be over 50 years old " ) , roads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a crash ... 33 Percent of our major highways are in poor or mediocre condition .

Best of luck . <p> Remember the Minneapolis bridge collapse ? Does the media ? Does the administration ? Do the administrations of each of the states ? There are so many things that can go wrong and this BP episode is such a scary test case of how badly things can screw up . <p> The Crumbling of America should be required viewing for local and national government , not to mention the local and national media who should be keeping their feet to the fire on guarding against disaster .

 reached the peak of desperation for finding solutions to the open oil well in the Gulf of Mexico . After a Russian newspaper suggested the tried and true tactic of sticking nuclear weapons under oil leaks to stop the flow , the idea of sticking a plutonium bomb in the Gulf is popping up everywhere as the only hope to save what little remains of the Gulf as it is now . The plan is only slightly less insane than it sounds . <p> The plan first appeared in the context of BP 's oil leak in Russian Pravda , where writer Vladimir Nagowski noted that Russia and , previously , the Soviet Union , had dug a hole deep and large enough for a small plutonium bomb near the oil well and detonated it underground , making the hole collapse on itself and stopping the leak ( Gawker dug up an instructional video of the plan ) . Yes , there is an Armageddon reference in his piece . <p> He also notes that nuclear " plugs , " sometimes three times as powerful as the Hiroshima bomb , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ failure in 1972 that " mysteriously " left a mushroom cloud where the gusher was supposed to be . According to Nagowski , the risk of a mushroom cloud in the Gulf of Mexico is " only " , so why not take a chance ? <p> Some people are listening . Over at National Review Online , Daniel Foster is hoping the President is coming around to it . As long as the fallout is " a limited amount of radioactive material across the vast Gulf , " which is " preferable to the blanketing of thousands of miles of American coastline in ribbons of tar , " he seems to like the idea . Yes , you just heard the " Gulf of Mexico is a very big ocean " argument again , this time to justify dumping a nuclear weapon in it . To Foster 's credit , the list of ideas BP has come up with , which he goes through in detail , do n't sound any more successful . He writes : <p> " The simple fact is that the leak has confounded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and its federal overseers to resort to a series of untested , increasingly unwieldy , and heretofore unsuccessful backup plans as the American people 's impatience and rage grow at geometric rates . In the madness that is Deepwater Horizon , The Bomb may be the sanest choice . " <p> Raw Story reports that the idea is also gaining some traction among energy experts like Mark Simmons , founder of energy investment bank Simmons and Company : <p> " Simmons said the US government should immediately take the effort to plug the leak out of the hands of BP and put the military in charge . ' Probably the only thing we can do is create a weapons system and send it down 18,000 feet and detonate it , hopefully encasing the oil , ' he said . " <p> Adding weight to the possibility of using a nuclear weapon to solve the oil spill is the fact that President Barack Obama has assembled a team of nuclear experts to come up with solutions for how to handle the leak and the subsequent damage to the ocean , according @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Energy Secretary Steven Chu , was described by BP CEO Tony Hayward as " lots of nuclear physicists and all sorts of people coming up with some quite good ideas actually . " <p> The most perplexing thing about this argument is why no one is suggesting a large amount of conventional weapons , rather than a small nuclear one , since conventional explosives would actually be available to BP without major government involvement , and would not mean the risk of significant radioactive contamination . So far , it appears that the largest members of America 's mainstream media are abstaining from bringing it up or supporting it , but as the idea seems to be floating around the internet , and worst case scenarios have the leak gushing well into August , we might be hearing more about the nuclear option as time goes by . <h> Summer 's best

 Conflicts of Interest In Covering BP Oil Spill <p> Since the BP oil spill began in the Gulf of Mexico 50 days ago , the media has been attacking the situation from all sides . Coverage has included everything from outraged citizens and wildlife to Obama trying to figure out " whose ass to kick . " But the Washington there is a more complex situation with conflict of interests since " BP bought up some of Washington 's biggest pundits to clean up their image . " <p> John Feehery is an example . He has worked on BP 's account with the Brunswick Group , according to the article , but also has appeared on CNN and MSNBC saying he 'd " like the administration to focus on plugging the damn hole . " There is nothing fundamentally wrong or misleading about that except that he was identified on television as Republican strategist . <p> defended himself : <p> " I did n't think we were going to talk about the issue , " he said .

 Carly Fiorina had some explaining to do yesterday after an off-air open mic caught her questioning fellow Republican Meg Whitman 's decision to go on Hannity and making fun of opponent Sen. Barbara Boxer 's hair . Tonight she went straight to Greta van Susteren to explain herself : yes , she thinks Sean Hannity is a tough interviewer , and as for the hair issue ? " It sort of goes with the territory . " <p> Her comment that Sean Hannity is " not an easy interview " saved a series of comments along the lines of " you know what he 's like " that could 've been interpreted pretty negatively , but talking to van Susteren on On the Record last night , she did n't really change her original statement . In fact , she added she is excited to sit down with Hannity at the end of the week , and fully expects him to give her as hard a time as she suspected he would give Whitman . " He is a tough interview and that 's his job !

 like me , you 're probably really in the mood for a story involving the planet 's sea life that is n't a tragedy . Fortunately , that 's exactly what the Miami Herald published this morning in the tale of Paul Shultz , a Coast Guard investigator who found a camera that washed up in Key West . Proving true to his job title , Shultz used the clues in the pictures inside and the help of people on the internet to locate the camera 's owners on the other side of the world . It 's a story that has everything : mystery , the kindness of strangers , and even a demonstration of a hungry sea turtle 's cinematography skills ! <p> When Shultz found the camera , it was covered in six months worth of sea growth but the camera inside was still working thanks to its protective water-proof case . He turned it on and started checking out the contents . At first he became concerned for the camera 's owners when he saw a video inside of what appeared to be an underwater struggle . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actually captured after a sea turtle tried to eat the camera and accidentally turned it on ( amazing video clip is below ! ) . <p> After he had made sure that the camera did n't contain some kind of Blair Witch hybrid and that the owners were probably still alive , Shultz decided to try to find them . His only clues were the pictures they had taken . <p> There were photos of two men preparing to scuba dive and a towheaded family nestled together on a couch . There was a mysterious relic settled deep into the sea floor . And even a puzzling video clip of splashing water that appeared to have been taken as the camera thrashed around under the control of something that was n't human . <p> " There was nothing on the pictures that said this camera belongs to so and so , " Shultz said . <p> After looking through the pictures , Shultz adopted the screen name of " " and took his hunt online . <p> He uploaded the images on , hoping some diving aficionados @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Internet sleuths had parsed the pictures and found some clues all pointing to Aruba , a Dutch island off Venezuela 's coast that 's 1,100 miles from Key West . <p> There was a plane 's tail number and a computer search showed the aircraft was in Aruba the day the photo was taken . There was a blue-roofed building that searchers pinpointed to the island using Google Earth . And there was a school poster written in Dutch . <p> But could the camera make such a trip ? , an associate professor of physical oceanography at the University of Miami , said such an odyssey is possible . The buoyancy of the plastic case combined with various currents could have taken the camera to Key West , she told The Associated Press in an e-mail . <p> With Shultz 's search narrowed , the resolution came quickly . He posted the pictures on the travel websites and Aruba.com , and within two days was contacted by an Aruban woman who said she recognized the children in some of the photos as classmates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the de Bruins , and all the pieces came together . <p> " I have a smile on my face ... I ca n't stop laughing about it , " Dick de Bruin said in a phone interview from Aruba . " It 's really big news ( on the island ) and in Europe . " <p> Yes , some stories just work out better than others . A Dutch family can lose a camera scuba diving in Aruba and still get it back but I will never again see the wallet I left in a cab somewhere . Oh well . <p> As promised , here is the incredible video that the sea turtle took . While the turtle is n't as skilled as this filmmaking octopus , the video is at least better than half of the movies in the theater this summer ! <h> Jay-Z , Stevie 
 Of Hypocrisy For Accepting Medicare Payments <p> Get ready for the second round of " Meet Rand Paul " on the cable news shows . Just a few weeks after the Kentucky Senatorial candidate was accused of being too Libertarian after criticizing the Civil Rights Act , his opponent , Jack Conway , is now claiming he 's not Libertarian enough . The charge ? Paul , who strongly opposes government handouts , receives a large amount of Medicare and Medicaid payments from his ophthalmology practice . These are pretty damning accusations . If there 's anything in politics that 's worse than being called a racist , it 's being called a hypocrite . <p> His campaign has said about half of Paul 's medical income in Bowling Green has come from Medicare and Medicaid payments which it says is in line with the average for eye doctors around the country . Since 2005 , Paul has received slightly more than in Medicaid funds , about one-third of the amount he billed the program , according to the Kentucky cabinet that administers the state-federal health insurance program for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figures on his Medicare payments , those are unclear as Paul and his campaign have refused to disclose them . This refusal has worked as even more ammunition from the Conway team . <p> So , is this a fair criticism ? A little bit , yeah . The problem is , Libertarianism is a tough ideal to hold to , especially when you run a medical office that caters primarily to the elderly . <p> " Paul campaign manager Jesse Benton defended Paul 's acceptance of Medicare and Medicaid payments , saying that to shun the two health care programs would " penalize his older patients or his poor patients . " Paul said he sees patients who rely on the government programs , private insurance or who pay for their own care . ' I do n't discriminate in my practice , and though I 'd prefer to have less government intervention in ... medicine , I put my patients first in this matter , ' the Republican said . ' My medical practice has never been about any ideology or running for office . ' " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deciding factor will probably be all of the Libertarians who stood by him during the Civil Rights brouhaha . If they feel let down he might be in trouble .

 ' Rachel Maddow Rewrites Obama 's Oval Office Address <p> As has been repeated extensively in the past 30 hours or so , President Obama 's first Oval Office Address was not quite received with open arms . Some were left unsatisfied ; others wondering what the president could have possibly done differently to make things better . But it 's safe to say few actually did anything about it . Rachel Maddow , on the other hand , went ahead and gave the speech she wanted to hear herself , fake Oval Office background and all . <p> Maddow 's concern with the speech was that it did n't go far enough to plan a way to prevent a similar tragedy in the Gulf of Mexico or anywhere , really in the future , and was not fiery enough to make up for it . President Maddow 's speech used much stronger language , expanding President Obama 's moratorium on offshore drilling indefinitely until safety technology was advanced significantly and promising that " the age of oil is over . " " Never again , " she hypothetically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allowed to drill in a location where they are incapable of dealing with the potential consequences of that drilling . " <p> In her idealized version of the speech , the president would promise a daily update on the situation in the Gulf of Mexico until life was mostly restored to its condition before Deepwater Horizon exploded , and , even more important than the clean up effort underway was the assurance that alternative energy sources would finally replace oil : <p> " The world is different now . Our country is different now . The scales have fallen from our eyes . People say we are not ready they 're right ; we 're not ready . We also were n't ready to fight in WWII before Pearl Harbor happened ... I no longer say that we must get off oil . We will get off oil , and here 's how . The United States Senate will pass an energy bill this year . The Senate version of the bill will not expand offshore drilling . The earlier targets in that bill for energy efficiency and for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> To do this , she continued , she would get the Senate to override filibusters and , in an extreme case , use as many executive orders as possible to get them through .

Maddow did not elaborate , however , on whether there was a plan B in case those deadlines were not met and , without offshore drilling , America was met with an energy definiciency , though buying foreign sources of energy seems to be the only alternative in that case . <p> " God bless the United States of America , " she concluded , adding a quick p.s. : " I 've also decided I 'm not a White Sox fan anymore I 'm a Red Sox fan .

For a reminder of just how intertwined Nike and Jordan are , check here . Considering the many well-known stories ( see #2 ) of Jordan going to great lengths to avoid publicly wearing anything but Nike , and it 's pretty clear that a tweet even an obviously fake one expressing misgivings about Nike 's human rights record probably would n't fly with Jordan himself , or any member of the Nike empire .@@1527086 <h> Hingham soccer coach

 last week , many wondered how his eulogizers might treat an ugly part of his past : his role as a leader/recruiter in a West Virginia chapter of the Ku Klux Klan . Former President Bill Clinton answered those questions while speaking during the memorial service , ostensibly defending Byrd 's part in the Klan by saying " he was a country boy from the hills and hollows of West Virginia , " adding " he was trying to get elected . " Fox News ' Media Analyst Bernard Goldberg took exception to the cavalier shrugging-off of Byrd 's racist past . <p> It 's a difficult thing to do criticize the words of someone praising the past of someone who has just past ( especially one who has given so many years of service to his country . ) However , Goldberg dared to point out what he seemed to be an offhand and inappropriately informal explanation of Byrd 's time in the Klan . And he makes some very good points without stomping on the legacy of the departed Senator . <p> First , the excepted words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are a lot of people who wrote these eulogies for Senator Byrd in the newspapers and I read a bunch of them . and they mention that he once had a fleeting association with the Ku Klux Klan . What does that mean ? I will tell what you it means . He was a country boy from the hills and hollows of West Virginia . He was trying to get elected . And maybe he did something he should n't have done , and he spent the rest of his life making it up . And that 's what a good person does . <p> Goldberg shows both deftness and reason in his critique of Clinton 's eulogy , given that damning the past of the " dearly departed " is ostensibly a very tricky wicket : <p> Well , first I thought the obvious . You do n't use a funeral to unload on the dearly departed . So I understand why Bill Clinton , you know , did what he did to some extent but he went way , way , way too far . <p> First @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Bill Clinton says well , he was just a country boy from West Virginia , trying to get elected as if , what , that somehow justifies joining the Klan ? Even in the 1940s , Bill , decent people did n't join the Ku Klux Klan . By the way , Robert Byrd was n't just a regular bigot in the Ku Klux Klan , he was a special bigot . He recruited the other morons who joined the could you Ku Klux Klan . Imagine today if some politician felt he had to bad mouth or bash black people in order to get elected . Do you think Bill Clinton would be be so cavalier or anybody else for that matter as to say , well , come on , he is just a country boy who is trying to get elected . Of course not . <p> And then the second thing Clinton said is that Robert Byrd spent the rest of his life making it up . That 's not even true . In 1964 , Robert Byrd not only voted against the civil rights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year later in 1965 , He voted against the voting rights act . Now , in fairness , later on in life , Robert Byrd championed making Martin Luther King 's birthday a national holiday . We will give him that . <p> But this leads to one of two possibilities . Either he had a genuine change of heart , which is possible , or he is simply made another political calculation . Just as he joined the Klan for political reasons , maybe he realized that being a bigot was n't going to work anymore . I 'm not saying that you use the funeral to bad-mouth the guy but Bill Clinton , ever the statesman , could have compromised and just said a little bit less . <p> O'Reilly summed up by reaffirming that " we a a nation that believes in forgiveness and redemption " but hedges with " I do n't think the media would have been so kind if Robert Byrd been a Republican .

 do this Fox News ? Why do you present a truly " fair and balanced " debate on an issue ( well , more like one versus three , but close enough , right ? ) and then disguise it with a stupid gimmick ?

Every interesting point brought up by the guests was overwhelmed by the fact that the panel was a realization of some weird joke .

And Jezebel 's Irin Carmon fired a big shot , calling the Daily Show " a boys ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The open letter from Daily Show women took that one head-on . " We 're indispensable , " they wrote . " We generate a significant portion of the show 's creative content and the fact is , it would n't be the show that you love without us . " <p> Fair , fair , and more than fair awesome . I had no idea so many women worked at the Daily Show and as a viewer and fan it was sort of incredible to see them all arrayed across that familiar set . <p> But . <p> But it 's also incredible because it 's so unusual . Because when we 've gotten a glimpse of the people behind the scenes in the past , emerging from the shadows to , say , claim their Emmys , that picture looks more like this : <p> And that 's what the letter did not address . <p> Where there is a ratio , there is a legitimate reason to ask why . That falls squarely on Jezebel 's beat . Even more so since the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so much attention this year , since the Letterman story broke and beyond , covered widely in mainstream as well as rabidly feminist media . <p> So Carmon 's research and reporting was not out of left field . More than that , it was research and reporting , on a question about which she has written about widely ( see here and here and here and here and here and here ) . Does that mean she is a greater authority on the Daily Show than the women who work there ? No . But , does that then disqualify her findings ? Again , no . <p> And that 's what made me sad about the Women of the Daily Show open letter : it seemed to freeze out the question entirely , the notion of questioning entirely . <p> I understand where they are coming from , why they wrote it and more than that , that they are damned proud of making it to one of the coolest and most competitive jobs in television . And more than that , I also get that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ applied , put themselves in the ring , showed up . As Lizz Winstead and Alison Silverman have pointed out , there are very few female applicants . ( Note that that 's the same reason given for the dearth of women getting VC money in the new media/tech startup scene . ) <p> But there are reasons for why there are so few female applicants . Is it just that women are lazy and/or unqualified ( or worse , unfunny ? ) Come on . It is not new to acknowledge that the pathways to these positions heavily favor men . <p> Women are funny . Women can be hot and funny . Men can be , too ! There 's no reason why they ca n't be hilarious together . But still , an overwhelming most of the time , they are not . And that 's why Jezebel did everyone women , comedy , women in comedy , and even these women in comedy a favor by raising this issue . @ @ @ Cool Things

 department of Human Rights has decided to ban " Ladies Night " the bar promotion that provides free or discounted drinks for female bar patrons because it is , in their purview , gender discrimination . Should a private business be allowed to offer discounts to attract a certain clientele ? This was was the remarkably absurd ( and " fair and balanced " ) debate between Fox New 's legal analyst Lis Wiehl and self-proclaimed " anti-feminist " Marc Rudov . If the story could n't be weirder , check the sudden and severe vitriol that evolves between the two panelists . <p> Somehow the discussion which is led by host Gretchen Carlson starts on the subject of free and/or discounted drinks for women , quickly goes to the perils of insurance companies covering Viagra over birth-control , and the stunningly leads to the very odd accusation made by Rudov that dating is akin to prostitution ? <p> Wiehl : The human rights board of Minnesota is wasting their time on ladies night ? Why do n't they go and check out hairdressers that charge women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cleaners that charge women twice and three times as much for blouses as they do a man for a shirt .

Minnesota has declared ladies nights a violation of human rights . But because they 're violating men , they 're not going to really enforce it unless men complain . This is the same state that allows convicted convicts to illegally vote for Al Franken . The fact of the matter is ladies night is just another female entitlement and women are n't going to show up at the bar unless they get free drinks . <p> Carlson : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Rudov : The state does n't care about enforcing the laws . <p> Carlson : let 's say yes , they do . come on . the state let 's say that the i go to ladies night and get a lot of women who come to the bar , do men like that or do they not ? <p> Rudov : Well , what you 're just doing is reinforcing the point that I 've always made is that dating is legal prostitution . if women are n't going to show up unless they 're bought and paid for , that 's prostitution . <p> first of all , get a life . ok ? come on . this is ridiculous . if the free drink so much , put a wig on and go to the bar , all right ?

That said , this is hilarious : USA Today is reporting that Cold War era paranoia is alive and well in today 's society ( albeit modified to accommodate the more ambiguous range of threats we face today ) in the form of a booming underground bunker industry .

 move for someone who has previously tried to affirm his heterosexuality ( yet a fairly expected one for someone who is now being called a gay icon ) , Illinois Representative Aaron Schock , with his camera-ready smile and infamous physique , showed up on the Bravo channel last night . <p> No , he was n't tossing back cocktails with Andy Cohen during a Watch What Happens Live after show , unfortunately . He was tasting some finger foods and offering valuable ethics lessons as a guest judge on Top Chef . <p> Presenting the non-elimination Quickfire Challenge , Schock and host Padma Lakshmi fumbled through a hard-to-follow explanation of the role that food plays in the relationship between members of congress and the lobbyists who try to court them . The challenge came together , however , when Lakshmi revealed that the chefs would have to create dishes that could be served on toothpicks to sway Schock in their favor . Still confused ? <p> The challenge recalls recent legislation that makes it more difficult for lobbyists to bribe politicians . In an apparent loophole , supplying congressmen with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treats can be enjoyed while standing . And thus the point of the challenge : " devising a delicious hors d'oeuvre that packs the punch of a full dish " and can be skewered on a tooth pick , putting the chefs in the role of lobbyists and Schock in the position of the hungry and possibly impressionable politician .@@1575478 <p> In France , 
 exactly new you do n't get to 6.6 million users overnight . In fact , Tumblr 's been around since November 2007 , when founder David Karp launched it at the ripe old age of 19 with the help of lead developer Marco Arment . Karp was waiting for traditional blog companies , like Blogger or WordPress , to come up with a platform for ' ' ( short-form posting ) , more akin to text messaging than a longer-form blog posting ( like , say , this ) . Karp got tired of waiting , and decided to go ahead and start it himself . <p> Here 's the gist of Tumblr : a dead-simple way to get out your ideas or inspirations , what you 're doing , what you like or hate , whatever snip of culture or sub-culture is engaging you at the moment , across any form of media photo , text , quip , video , audio clip , chat transcript . The sum total contributes to a unique online identity through sharing what you gather on the web with your followers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's as simple as " LOL " ) . <p> There are two very important elements of Tumblr , the ability to " follow " other users and to " reblog " their posts . When you " follow " another tumblr , all of their posts show up in your dashboard , which is where you can post new content , read content created by people you follow , and see the reactions of other users to that content , theirs or yours.You can reblog the posts you like and add your commentary to the post . And it should be noted : Before there was retweeting on Twitter , there was reblogging on Tumblr . <p> Tumblr 's growth has been incredible . Last month , it broke Technorati 's top 50 sites on the Internet . ( That 's the whole internet . ) It 's not just that they have 6.6 million users , it 's that those users are highly engaged . ( A year ago , in preparation for another piece about Tumblr , Karp told me that the average Tumblr post had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compared to an average 1.5 comments on the average WordPress post . ) In March , the company clocked their posts at about 2 million per day . <p> All this to say : Of course the MSM will want to get on Tumblr ! It 's a no-brainer , and we 'll see it happen just as we saw the eventual stampede of conventional news outlets to get in on Facebook and Twitter . Everyone needs every edge they can get nowadays why would n't you take advantage of an additional content stream ? <p> They will eventually . Meanwhile , the smart ones are doing it first . The NYT 's Jenna Wortham cites the now-famous example of Newsweek 's Mark Coatney , who used the Newsweek Tumblr to engage a whole new audience with the magazine 's content ( and , it should be noted , a savvy and influential audience too , including many web writers and editors who scour Tumblr just like Twitter for content to aggregate ) . Wortham cites a few of the new blue-chip entries to the form the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , HuffPo and the NYT itself ; others include the Today Show , which adopted the model of having a editor run the show ( staffer Rina Raphael , who has been on Tumblr herself for well over a year ) . And disclosure alert online sports-blog network behemoth SBNation tapped me , a longtime Tumblr user , for the same reason ( so please come visit us at ! ) . <p> Will Tumblr become the new Twitter ? ( Both seem to be taking their time to monetize , but that 's another story . ) There 's no question that a Tumblr takes more work to keep up it is essentially a blog , after all , and however short-form it may be it still takes more work than 140 characters but there 's also no question that the payoff for smart content companies is there , in new audiences , user engagement and creative possibility . Is this the tipping point ? I guess we 'll see . <p> With Rachel Sklar . NB : Rachel Sklar is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Anthony de Rosa for its Tumblr .

 9 : A Trip Through The Lower 9th Ward in New Orleans <p> I was in New Orleans this past weekend for the fifth anniversary of Hurricane Katrina , and was fortunate to pay a few visits to the Lower 9th Ward one of the hardest-hit neighborhoods , and on the front lines when the levees broke ( literally the neighborhood is right on the Industrial Canal Levee ) . In defiance of what happened five years ago and defiantly in plain view of the levee the Make It Right Foundation , Brad Pitt 's non-profit org , has built and continues to build sustainable , affordable and hurricane-resistant homes for displaced residents of the Lower 9th . These modern , brightly-colored , geometric angled new homes sit high on a sturdy raised foundation , with mandated open roof access in case of the worst-case scenario . They look great . <p> They look great , but over 4,000 homes were lost five years ago and Make It Right is building 150 . On Tennessee Street and surrounding , the gleaming new homes are rising @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in a larger neighborhood where countless homes still stand , empty and broken and boarded-up and decaying . On many , the spray-painted ' X ' markings from recovery teams is still in sight , with their symbols indicating , among other things , how many bodies were found inside . ( I spoke last night with a member of one of those teams , who said that the high water would sometimes carry strange bodies into homes , through open walls and blown-out doors , to be deposited there to be found or , worse , dealt with by whomever might be there to meet it . The flooding of the Lower 9th left scores dead ( I 'm currently reading1 Dead In Attic by Times-Picayune writer Chris Rose , whose title comes from the grim yet all-too-common reports from those dark days ) . I walked around the Lower 9th on Sunday , and realized with a shock that the water would have been probably three times my height , at least ; from where I stood on Tennessee Street , with the levee in clear view @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could have survived . <p> We were on Tennessee for a second line street party , where the neighborhood marches along with a brass band , amid lots of clapping , singing and dancing . Afterward a man stood up on a ladder against a tree and hung a wreath , inside which was a drawing of a man on his roof with the waters closing in , waving an American flag . He said that his mother , grandmother and niece were lost on that day , but they were all still here and the Lower 9th would go on . They would rebuild , and they 'd never leave .

If you are a Bad Religion fan , or a student of Professor Graffin 's perhaps this wo n't come as a total surprise , but for everyone else here 's some ( pretty fascinating ) background . <p> Graffin started his unusual career trajectory as the leader of the 70 's punk rock band Bad Religion , which he co-founded at the age of 15 . However , perhaps less widely known is the fact he went on to earn a master 's degree in geology from UCLA , and later received his Ph.D . from Cornell University . Currently Graffin teaches a class in evolution at UCLA and he 's also co-authored a new book with Steve Olson called Anarchy Evolution : Faith , Science , and Bad Religion in a World Without God . I told you it was unusual . <p> The book , which hit stands last week , is described as " equal parts memoir and manifesto " combining Graffin 's " experiences in punk culture and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " deep connection between art , religion , and science . " Not surprisingly it 's been turning heads . Graffin stopped by Morning Joe last week to talk about Anarchy Evolution and ended up reflecting on Bill O'Reilly 's sharp words with Bill Maher over the origins of the universe as described by Christine O'Donnell , as well as discussing ( ish ) with Peggy Noonan her views of how science relates to God . You can watch the MJ clip below . <p> " Unfortunately , science can not be reduced to short catchy phrases . And if this is all that the general public can comprehend , it 's no wonder that we spend so much of our time in the interminable debate about belief in God , or lack thereof . " <p> Intrigued ?

Did similar things draw you to both ? <p> I definitely was attracted to similar things in punk and science . They both depend on a healthy dose of skepticism . My science teachers always encouraged their classes to " go out and discover something " because all scientific endeavors depend on observation and experimentation . Through such pursuits anyone can find something new to science , and if it 's truly novel , the entire edifice of science might have to be restructured . In this way , science is a constant challenge to authority , and no scientist swells with too much hubris because she knows that anyone might come along with some new verifiable data that can cause a revolution . The thread of culture that runs through the entire history of punk is also a dedication to challenging the authoritarian . So , in this way i see a connection , and i feel comfortable in both circles . <p> There has been a lot of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in light of Christine O'donnell 's remarks on mice with human brains , etc . Is it frustrating to hear the political conversation on science , and the science of evolution get distilled down to silly soundbites ? <p> When I was on MSNBC last week , I was challenged to explain the origin of the earth in 5 seconds . Now the host said it partly sarcastically , but they would definitely prefer a five second answer over a conversation that might take longer but systematically lays out the evidence . There is very little patience for science it seems and this greatly hobbles the ability of the even best story tellers to explain basic natural phenomena . <p> You are an atheist . What is your response to a political season that is revolving around whether President Obama attends church , and who is building mosque where ? <p> Politics , sadly , is also about sound bites .

 's Failed Campaign : " A Model Of Dysfunction " <p> In the mood for some dirt on the midterms ? You 're in luck yesterday , Shira Toeplitz of Politico published a long postmortem of Sharron Angle 's campaign , which was apparently as poorly-organized and ineffective as Harry Reid 's was compelling . <p> focuses most on Terry Campbell , Angle 's longtime aide and campaign manager . The writer uses an incident in which Campbell almost canceled an appearance by John McCain at an Angle campaign event as an example of the manager 's ineptitude : <p> While McCain was en route to the event , held five days before Election Day , Angle was bombarded with calls from teary tea party activists who begged her not to campaign with the Arizona senator because they contended he was not conservative enough to appear on the same stage with her . <p> The source of the emotional appeals from some of Angle 's most loyal followers ? Campbell himself did the urging , according to multiple sources with first-hand knowledge of the incident . Much to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the McCain event went on without a hitch . <p> " In the 20 years that I 've been involved politically , I 've never had the misfortune of working with such sheer , utter incompetence . Too much is at stake in these political campaigns people like Campbell do n't need to be anywhere near them , " said Chris LaCivita , who served as political director for the National Republican Senatorial Committee this fall and worked directly with the Angle campaign . " If they were filming a sequel to the movie ' Dumb and Dumber , ' Terry Campbell would have a feature role . " <p> Additionally , Campbell could n't keep track of the campaign 's finances , had a voice mail box that was constantly full , and did n't answer emails for days a serious handicap in the fast-paced world of 21st century campaigning . At one point he called the National Republican Senatorial Committee about President Obama 's upcoming visit to Nevada , only to discover that Obama had arrived in Angle 's home state two days earlier . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as buying advertisements on closed-circuit television cameras at gyms and hiring a plane to be called " Angle One " for sky-writing the candidate 's name all of which were criticized as a waste of money by the professional operatives working on the race . <p> At one point , Campbell hired a digital billboard truck with Angle 's face on it that drove around the tourist-drenched Las Vegas Strip a tactic he referred to as a " game changer , " according to three sources . <p> Though various outside organizations pleaded with Angle to fire Campbell , she remained fiercely loyal to her old friend even when he chose to have elective knee surgery soon after her primary win , taking him out of the ring for several weeks . That blunder allowed Reid to get a head start on fall campaigning , launching ads that painted Angle " as an out-of-touch extremist attacks that went unanswered for weeks , " writes Toeplitz . <p> Thanks in no small part to Campbell 's incompetence , Angle squandered the 11-point lead she had over Reid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ election .

 The Self- Objectification Of Julian Assange <p> If there is one cardinal rule that binds all media and all mass production of information , it 's that sex sells . It sells big and it sells female , whether it 's scantily clad photos of Fox News ' leading lady or x-rays of curvy skeletons in heels . It 's been the bane of the existence of many women for decades , and instead of subsiding for them as media evolves , something bizarre has begun to happen : what do we make of our culture when the sex that is selling is gaunt , male , brainy , and wanted by Interpol for rape " sex crimes " ? <p> Frequenters of online information pirate website Wikileaks surely must have noticed something new when the company , booted out of their original domain name Wikileaks.org , landed on Swiss servers at Wikileaks.ch : the website 's proprietor , Julian Assange , reclined casually over the site 's header , in what appears to be an expensive suit and a come-hither look worthy of a teen heartthrob ( that look courtesy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ month ) . Should you miss him on the homepage , Assange also asks for money to support the site on every single page of the newly-leaked US diplomatic cables in the same pose , in which there is an unequivocal appeal to his sexuality . <p> Why is a man wanted by Interpol for sex crimes littering his website with seductive photos of himself ? Given what we know about Assange so far , the short answer is self-indulgence . This is a man who allows no room for dissent in his organization ; who will walk out of an interview at the drop of a hat and spend the day tweeting catty things at the Pentagon like a Kardashian . There is no stooping too low when egos are concerned at the very least , Assange has yet to hit the bottom of his vanity . Yet the shock is not that Assange would feel comfortable enough to do this , but that the media is mostly letting him get away with it , too distracted with the details of his actual day job ( leaking confidential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figures would have survived . <p> In some ways , it has worked . After repeated bashings for looking like a Bond villain back in the " Collateral Murder " days , Assange cut and dyed his hair ( moving eulogy to the silver mane here ) and started wearing suits for a change . The very least it got him was his very own fanpage , where giddy fangirls ( and boys ) fawn over him and lament they were not the objects of his rape charges ( really ) . Degrading , perhaps , but it 's all a walking PR disaster the size of former BP CEO Tony Hayward can do to keep the public in his favor . Those who perceive a gender bias in the way media figures must present themselves should take some solace in the fact that sex is now a tool for both genders or , at the very least , Assange is desperately trying to make that so . In the aforementioned Megyn Kelly case , those who supported her choice to look sexy in a skimpy dress without a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's version of a skimpy outfit and sexy look devoid of irony engenders more pause . The personalities and histories , of course , are different , whether there is something equally empowering or degrading about a man taking to what has traditionally been a woman 's battlefield to save his image has now become a matter of contention where , previously , the physical exploitation of a male figure was only possible for the sake of comedy . <p> Had it been any other website proprietor , it would have been ridiculous enough imagine a new Drudge Report with Matt Drudge 's bedroom eyes baring down from above , or Big Andrew Breitbart pinups all over the place , or a Daily Caller with something like this wallpapered everywhere . Because these are all men , it would be quite funny ; one suspects Arianna Huffington would not get away with being " funny , " but rather would be accused in a rainbow of euphemisms of prostituting her image for money . That Julian Assange is now doing the same when he faces an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gutsy , bizarre , disarming , insane move worthy of universal mockery or universal recognition . <h> First wave of 
 Media Mask , Are We A Nation of Agoraphobes ? <p> Remember back to the days before social media had really made it 's grand entrance , back to when if you wanted to get in touch with someone , you had to use an actual landline , and then you had to actually SHOW UP on time because cell phones were not yet a prevalent part of society ? Way before the days of Facebook , when you had to actually phone someone ( Not text , CALL ) to find out what they were up to ? And a lifetime before Foursquare , which allows you to not even have to call , nor text , but simply to hit the " Friends " button to see where your companions are so that you can meet up ? Remember when in order to syndicate your media pieces , you actually had to email them , rather than just posting a URL to Twitter ? Remember this time ? Yeah , I barely do either . <p> If you had told me ten years ago , when I was in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that there would soon be a world where I could do nearly all communication online or via text , rather than calling my crush , only to hang up three times in a row when he answered , I would 've begged for you to transport me right then and there into the future . I have a barrage of friends who NEVER actually use their cell phones to make calls , ( nor do they answer them ) . They ONLY text , and even if you call them , they will listen to the voicemail and then text in response . I wonder how these people got through those awkward teen years when you had to be courageous enough to live in the moment of the phone call . Perhaps , if they had answering machines , they were chronic screeners . I admit that I am prone to the cell phone screen myself . In fact , I do it a lot , and for selfish reasons : usually I just want to hear what you leave on my voicemail and then respond to it when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I do n't want to have to think on my feet . I want time to formulate an intelligent and sound response , and then I will call you back . I think about the " screen " a lot actually , and periodically go through phases where I force myself to pick up each and every call as it comes in . I find that I am more productive and lively when I do this , but unfortunately , I 'm never quite able to keep it going . <p> Facebook is yet another way to tactfully avoid potentially awkward situations . Let 's say , for example , that you 've just had an argument with Friend A , and you want to see how REALLY angry they are . Well , if they are the rabid sort of FB user , all you need to do is hop online and check out their status . If they are still really pissed , you will probably know it . I think about FB a lot in terms of dating , also . There 's always that moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to decide whether or not to make the leap . Do you befriend them immediately ? Do you wait until you 've really determined that you like each other ? Or do you creepily stalk them , praying that they do n't have their profile set to private ? But let 's say that you do decide to befriend them . You search for their name , and discover that THEY 'RE NOT ON FACEBOOK ? ! How , HOW , is this possible , you wonder ? Everyone is on Facebook . Even your ( God help you ) mother ! How can you possibly get to really know this person without viewing their profile , wall comments , relationship status , and obliterated college photos ? Suddenly you become a bit untrusting . What does this person have to hide that could deter them from joining the rest of society ? You realize that if you wish to continue to date this freak of nature , you will have to actually ask them the questions that you are curious about . <p> And now of course , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ text to find out where the party is on any given evening . You can simply identify where all of your friends are , and drop in on the one(s) that you desire to see . Foursquare is also a fantastic way to sneakily avoid certain parts of town where you may run into those that you really do not wish to see . You are once again able to avoid the happenstance of the real world . <p> I realize that none of this is particularly profound , and I 'm certainly not the first to ponder the issue , but I do wonder where all of it is leading . Are we turning into a world of agoraphobes ? Will the cell phone one day become obsolete , and instead we will simply have " text machines ? " Oh , wait . We already do : the iPad . But will this become mainstream ? Will we one day all just sit in our apartments and video chat , glass of wine in hand ? Of course , there are a myriad of ways in which social @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need to go into that . I am a huge proponent ( and abuser ) of it , but I do question whether or not it 's turning us all into a bunch of scared , Xanax-popping recluses . On those days where I force myself to answer every call as it comes in , even if it is the dreaded " Unknown Number , " I find myself living in ( and missing ) the days of the good old-fashioned rotary phone . Behind every ring was an uncertain possibility , and you were forced to remove yourself from whatever activity you were currently involved in . Perhaps this is all just my issue , but I think it 'd be nice to remove ourselves from behind our laptops , smartphones , and other social facemasks for just a bit . Too much comfort is isolating .@@1739130 <p> He kept a

 joked that Bristol Palin looked like " the white Precious " after her supposed weight gain , her audience a group of servicemen and women at the Marine Corps Air Station in Miramar , California booed in response . Curiously , though , the group responded much more positively when Griffin made a crack about " deformities " even though soldiers injured in battle must have been watching the show , VH1 Divas Salute the Troops , both during its taping and as it was simulcast around the globe . <p> Griffin 's joke came during a bit in which she read a list of standards to which she was supposedly ordered to adhere . The audience howled as she recited the first entry on the list , " Entertainment must be wholesome and adhere to the standards of good taste .

 Putin is at it again .

The big game , it turns out , will be the game after the supposed Game of the Year . In San Antonio on Tuesday night , the Lakers will be out to give themselves and their fans the much-needed gift of hope . " <p> This is what Ding is alleging Selva stole . When I first read that , my initial assumption was that it must have been merely an example of parallel thinking , the phenomenon that leads two late night comics to hear that Sarah Palin killed a deer in late December and go " Hmmm , Palin killing deer around Christmas ...

 Press Pool : No Topless Pics Of President Obama <p> " I 'm not going to let you guys take a picture of me with my shirt off , ' ' President Obama said to reporters earlier this year , during a trip to Florida 's Gulf coast . And Sheryl Gay in the New York Times that the ban on photographing the Commander-in-Chief 's naked torso is also in effect in Hawaii : " The White House gave the press pool traveling with the president strict instructions that there would be no long lenses or other sneaky attempts to take pictures of a shirtless leader of the free world . " <p> So what is Obama trying to hide ? Just his ripped bod , apparently : <p> The subject of images of Mr. Obama sans shirt has been a touchy one during his presidency . In 2008 , when he was president-elect , some pictures emerged from him body-surfing in Hawaii , and he seemed a little sheepish when they were splashed all over the tabloids and magazines .

 to kick back and take it easy during the holidays . That 's why so many blogs fill up space with lists like 2010 's Top 10 People Named Dave or whatever other silliness they wrote two weeks earlier . So , for their last segment of the year , Jansing &amp; Co. had a little fun , bringing in body language expert Lillian Glass to explain the importance of that perfect New Year 's Eve kiss . Unsurprisingly , the segment got fairly goofy fairly quickly until it just devolved into discussions of the various guests ' romantic techniques and a talk of how " awesome " Cory Booker is . <p> The jokey from the start piece just dropped all pretentions once Chris Jansing tried asking everyone about a poll stating more women than men would consider bad kissing to be a deal breaker . When she tried asking Salon 's Steve Kornacki if he would ever dump a woman over her kissing style , he sheepishly admitted that he 'd more likely be on the other end . Soon Jansing was threatening to call up his ex-girlfriends to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the " nice ladies " that Kornacki would be hanging out with tomorrow night .

 Or , The Minefield of Holiday Greetings <p> I hope everyone has been having a nice holiday season . Whatever you celebrate . Which brings me to an interesting subject : the PC-ness of the holidays and the awkward hilarity that ensues . I 'm not really talking about whether you say Merry Christmas or Happy Holidays or whatever . It 's more about how I 'm an idiot . I have been putting my foot in my mouth since I learned to talk , and 34.5 years into my life that has n't changed . <p> Let me just say that Christmas + social networking = landmines . I spent the last week stepping all over them . I 'm part of a lovely group of friends on Twitter who extend greetings to each other on a daily basis , and when I get a chance I try to reply back to everyone . On Christmas Eve Eve I wanted to get a jump on my holiday greetings I decided to go for the " reply all " on a daily hello and wish everyone a Happy Christmas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that comes when one hits " reply all " without thinking . <p> I was really thrown off when another of my other lovely twitter friends , Sara , wished me a heartfelt Merry Christmas . <p> More internal dialogue : <p> Sara just sent me a sweet Christmas greeting . Hold up . Is n't she Jewish ? *Checks twitter feed to confirm , since there is confusion. * Yep . She 's Jewish . But she 's tweeting about going to a Christmas celebration . SO CONFUSED ! ! Well now how do I reply ? <p> I did n't want to blow my idiot streak , so I wished her a Merry December 25 . You know , instead of the very original " Merry December 23 . " Could there possibly be a worst greeting ? You wo n't find those cards at Hallmark , and for good reason . But really , how do you wish a Jewish friend Merry Christmas ? ( Yes , I realize that 's a dumb question , but I 'm on a dumb roll here . ) I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , since it 's hard to find even an open gas station on Christmas , yet nothing closes for Hanukkah . Seems a little unfair . <p> Fortunately , as I belatedly learned , Sara wrote a post about what Jews do on Christmas if only I had read that before getting all awkward ! I will know for next year . Until then , I 'm sure there will plenty of other opportunities to be awkward on Twitter .

Stewart said he had never been happier to see " math " and " arithmetic " used in a speech , gleefully contrasting Clinton 's approach of getting specific with how vaguely the Republican ticket laid out their policies last week . <p> Before getting to last night 's speeches , Stewart addressed the controversy over the Democratic platform omitting language about God and Jerusalem , saying that God is n't so petty that he immediately " freaks out " if you do n't mention him . Naturally , the Democrats stood by their platform 100 percent ... except for when they did a complete 180 yesterday . Stewart found it particularly ridiculous that despite the fact that the vote looked " dead-even " from the delegates , the motion passed anyway . <p> And then Stewart transitioned to Clinton 's big speech , which he immediately noted was unbelievably long , hitting on almost every important policy issue in the country right now , and with " more false endings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stewart did credit Clinton with bringing something truly unique to the convention : numbers and facts .

 longstanding gun advocate talking points about how arming everyone makes the world safer , and is being presented as some sort of neutral scientific assessment . Before anyone in the mainstream media is tempted to fll for this con , they should know two things : It seems like no one reporting on this study has fully read its contents ; and its author , Mark Gius , has something of a right-wing " tell . " <p> Breitbart calls it a " Quinnipiac Study " because the author is a professor of economics at Quinnipiac University , but the study is published in the journal Applied Economics Letters . The reason I say no one reporting on Gius ' study " An examination of the effects of concealed weapons laws and assault weapons bans on state-level murder rates " is that no one seems to quote anything but the study 's abstract : <p> The purpose of the present study is to determine the effects of state-level assault weapons bans and concealed weapons laws on state-level murder rates . Using data for the period 1980 to 2009 and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the present study suggest that states with restrictions on the carrying of concealed weapons had higher gun-related murder rates than other states . It was also found that assault weapons bans did not significantly affect murder rates at the state level . These results suggest that restrictive concealed weapons laws may cause an increase in gun-related murders at the state level . The results of this study are consistent with some prior research in this area , most notably Lott and Mustard ( 1997 ) . <p> The correct way to report on this would perhaps be to say " Economics Professor Claims Study Shows That Concealed Carry Results in Fewer Murders , " unless you 've actually read the full study . <p> If you want to read it , you 've got to pay , but even the abstract gives away the game . Gun control advocates will be the first to tell you that weak state laws can render strong local laws useless , and nonexistent federal laws do the same to decent state laws . Banning guns at the local or state level is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bathtub . The National Firearms Act demonstrates how effective strong federal laws can be at eliminating crimes with certain classes of weapon . <p> One clue that Gius might not be such a straight shooter , ideologically speaking , is evident in his " The Impact of Ultrasound Laws on the Demand for Abortions by Young Women , " which naturally concludes that forced ultrasound laws " reduce the odds of a woman having an abortion quite substantially . " <p> In his conclusion , though , Gius slips up a little further emphasis mine : <p> The primary motivation for the present study was to determine if the anecdotal evidence on ultrasound laws was true : did giving women the opportunity to view their unborn fetus reduce the probability that they would have an abortion ? Most pro-life groups believe that is the case . Most pro-choice groups also believe it to be true , although they believe that these laws are unconstitutional . Results of the present study suggest , however , that both groups are correct ; ultrasound requirement laws reduce the odds of a woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is rusty , women in all 50 states have the opportunity to view an ultrasound .

 to Call Benghazi an ' Act of Terror ' Following the Attack <p> Remember when it was a huge deal that President Barack Hussein Obama just flat-out refused to call the September 11 , 2012 attack in Benghazi , Libya an " act of terror , " or an anything of terror , except for the three times he did it in the two days following that attack ? Well , it turns out there was someone else who even more stubbornly refused to combine any reference to the attack with the word " terror " in the days following the tragedy , which has become a relentless political attack . <p> This narrative was a popular theme with conservatives , and the myth that President Obama did n't call the Benghazi attack an " act of terror " did n't die on the debate stage with Mitt Romney . People kept repeating it long after that . Fox News ' Ed it yesterday . The fact is that , in the days following the attack , the " terror " label was n't in question , but rather , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the perpetrators ' relationship to international terrorist organizations ( another part of the myth is that Susan Rice never mentioned terrorists on the Sunday shows , even though she specifically said it might be al Qaeda ) . <p> So while it is completely untrue that President Obama avoided the use of the " t-word " in the days following the attack , there was someone who danced a Riverdance around it in his or her first White House briefing following the attack , repeatedly making ambiguous references to " violence " in Libya , and the incident itself as simply an " attack , " with not a single mention of the word " terror . " <p> Can you guess who it was ? <p> Now , in all fairness to Fox News ' Ed Henry , there 's a pretty good reason why he did n't call Benghazi a " terror attack " during that briefing : Because aside from the obvious fact that there had been an attack , and it was , as the President said three times that week , an " act @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operational allegiances of the perpetrators were under investigation . We now know that a New York Times investigation found no " evidence that al Qaeda or other terrorist groups had any role in that assault , and suggests the deadly attack was in part due to anger at an American-made video seen as anti-Islam " ( that 's not an exact quote , it 's what I heard on Fox News ) , and that according to the Intelligence Community , " the nature of the attacks suggested they did not involve significant pre-planning , " but how could Ed Henry have known any of that at the time ? At least he did n't call the terrorists " protesters , " like this guy did : <p> Anti-abortion protesters assemble

 the State of the Union : More Viewers Tune Out , Attendees Fall Asleep <p> The State of the Union is one of the highest-rated television programs of the year . But thanks to more options on the tube , pad or phone ... along with a growing disdain for all-things DC ( President , Congress ... does n't matter ) , viewers at home are tuning out more and more . <p> Last year , President Obama 's speech was watched by 33.5 million people despite being on 14 different networks . For context , that 's only half the number of people who watched Bill Clinton 's SOTU in 1993 ... when the address was only seen on seven networks . For those into pop culture comparisons , Mr. Obama 's 2013 speech was 43 million viewers short of NBC 's Seinfeld finale ( which still makes me angry for sucking as badly as it did and ending the greatest series of all-time on such a craptastic note ... but that 's a column for another time ) and seven million short of the last year 's Oscars ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Perhaps the declining interest is because of the repetition of the whole spectacle . You know the drill : President enters ( does n't matter if it 's a Democrat or Republican ) and has that " Wow ! I ca n't believe you made it ! " expression when glad-handing attendees along the way . This is followed by breathless , hyperbolic predictions of the usual pundits off-screen , who will not focus on , you know ... the actual state of our union that impacts the daily lives of people at home ( economy , health care , foreign policy , jobs , etc. ) but instead focuses strictly on the President and what it means to his image : Can he improve his poll numbers ? Will this speech turn things around ? Can he use this stage to regain the trust he 's lost of some Americans ? <p> Then there 's the speech itself , which can last anywhere from 1 hour and 24 minutes ( Bill Clinton , 1995 ) to 28 minutes , 55 seconds ( Nixon in ' 72 ) . Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thus far ( going approximately 1 hour and three minutes ) , while Jimmy Carter preferred to keep matters short ( wonder why ? ) , clocking in at an average of 35 minutes , 26 seconds . <p> But the State of the Union ? You 'd be hard-pressed to count on one hand how many notable moments there 's been ( from the podium , anyway ) since they began being televised back in 1966 ( LBJ ) . <p> Sure , there was Bill Clinton 's declaration that " the era of big government is over . " In 2009 , there was GOP Congressman Joe Wilson shouting " You Lie ! " to Obama in the middle of his ( it looked like an official SOTU , but was actually a joint session of Congress ) . And President Bush outlined his world view in 2002 , which included actually naming U.S. ally Iran as part of an " axis of evil " along with North Korea and Iraq ( for those just joining us today , MSNBC 's Andrea Mitchell stated Iran was " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2002 . Someone better tell Ben Affleck re-edit Argo ) . <p> But mostly , the SOTU is a study of what 's happening with the eyes of the attendees . Nancy Pelosi blinked her way to infamy in 2007 ( 41 times in 30 seconds , according to a skit on The Colbert Report ) .

 who was the focus of a recent Daily Show piece on minimum wage laws has released an email from the show 's staff in the process of accusing them of lying and editing his words out of context to make him seem villainous . <p> Euro Pacific CEO Peter Schiff was interviewed by Samantha Bee as the voice in opposition to minimum wage hikes . The segment made headlines when Schiff responded to a question about " who would be willing to work for per hour " with the answer : " The mentally retarded . " <p> Suffice it to say , the final cut of the interview did not reflect well upon the businessman . Following the segment 's airing and subsequent viewer outrage , Schiff took to his website to blast The Daily Show for whittling down his 4-hour interview into the offending soundbite : <p> My use of the words " mentally retarded " ( when Samantha Bee asked me who might be willing to work for per hour a figure she suggested ) has come to define the entire interview . Although I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't remember the politically correct term currently in use ( it is " intellectually disabled " ) . Assuming she knew it , Bee could have prompted me with the correct term , but she chose not to . By including those comments in the final package , " The Daily Show " proved that they did not care who they offended , as long as they could make me look bad in the process . The volume of hate mail I have received in the show 's aftermath confirms their success on that front . <p> When asked the per hour question , I responded that very few individuals would take a job at that pay , even if it were legal . In a free market , businesses compete for customers by keeping prices down , and for labor by keeping wages up . Any employer offering even low-skilled workers just per hour would be outbid by others offering to pay more . <p> However I did suggest two groups of people who might be willing to work for per hour . The first group @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who tend to value work experience and connections more than pay . ( In fact , " The Daily Show " staffer who booked me , and who was present during the interview , had been thrilled to start there as an unpaid intern ) . Since many interns work for free , per hour would be an improvement . Some interns are even willing to pay to work . <p> And Schiff asserted that the show purposely left out the broader context of his argument : <p> ... " The Daily Show " was never interested in an honest debate about the minimum wage . Nor is it concerned with the intellectually disabled , whom they have no qualms about offending if they can get a laugh . In fact , it 's " The Daily Show " that wants to tell the intellectually disabled they are worthless , as they want to make it illegal for them to have jobs . I did not notice any intellectually disabled people working at " The Daily Show . " I 'm sure many would jump at the chance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But since they choose to pay their intellectually capable interns zero , why should they be expected to pay the intellectually disabled more ? <p> We NEVER edit out of context . Meaning we never ever show responses to a question we never asked . For starters it LOOKS BAD ! But in all seriousness it 's not our prerogative to attack our interview subjects &amp; slander them ( unless they say really horrible , awful , racist things ... but last I checked Peter does n't say such things ! ) . <p> The general idea is to pretend this is a real news interview &amp; correct our correspondent when he/she asks goofy questions . Our questions usually come from misunderstanding the other side 's arguments , for example . We want our interview subject to play the straight guy &amp; that way they look normal &amp; we look like the fool . <p> In this case Samantha Bee is our correspondent . She 'll take things she heard at these fast food strikes &amp; report them back to Peter . Peter tells Sam why she may be mistaken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , etc . That 's the general idea . And we 'll go over all of this before we start up the cameras next week .

 that often suffices for expertise on cable news was perhaps never more smug than when former Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney warned the American public that Russia was rapidly positioning itself as America 's " number one geopolitical foe . " Among the worst offenders were the hosts and guests who provide MSNBC with content on a daily basis . <p> In early 2012 , President Barack Obama was caught on an open microphone telling Russia 's then-President Dmitry Medvedev that he would have more " flexibility " after the presidential election in his dealings with Russia . Romney reacted strongly to that comment . Appearing on CNN , the GOP nominee said that the United States should regard Russia as a geopolitical adversary and should work to limit Russia 's flexibility rather than to secure it . His observation was soundly criticized by the president 's defenders who , at the time , were still attempting to rehabilitate Obama 's floundering " Reset " with Russia . <p> There were few who defended Romney 's comments . Even snake-bit Republicans , chastened by the swift backlash in the media , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the challenges posed by Moscow . But MSNBC 's wagons circled particularly quickly in defense of the president . Volley after volley of snark was lobbed in the GOP nominee 's direction . <p> " I do n't know what decade this guy 's living in , " MSNBC host Chris Matthews said with a sigh on March 28 , 2012 . " Is he trying to play Ronald Reagan here , or what ? " <p> " This is Mitt Romney 's severely conservative problem , " University of Georgia professor Cynthia Tucker opined on-the-air . " It made Romney look dumb . He 's not a dumb man , but he said something that was clearly dumb . " <p> Huffington Post reporter Sam Stein agreed that Romney 's statement was evidence of an " antiquated worldview . " He fretted further about how Romney , should he become president , would enter the office having severely complicated America 's bilateral relations with Moscow given his carelessly provocative statement . <p> " I personally am worried about what it says to the Russian people , " Matthews added @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Please enable Javascript to watch . <p> MSNBC hosts Rachel Maddow and Lawrence O'Donnell got in on the self-satisfied ridicule , too . Promoting Maddow 's latest book about the " unmooring of American military power , " O'Donnell asked the flagship MSNBC host if Romney was merely reflecting on what he might have read in that book . <p> " He read about Reagan 's private , cabal of team-B zealots who were telling him that Russia had all the stuff they did n't have so he could justify a giant defense budget , " Maddow submitted scornfully . <p> " It is amazing that Mitt Romney can flip like that just as soon as he hears something to exploit in foreign policy , " O'Donnell remarked . Watch that below : <p> I can appreciate why the Romney campaign would try to make Obama 's " hot mic " story interesting , but the problem is the former governor just does n't have any real policy chops in this area .

 of Female GOPer Another Blow to the ' War on Women ' <p> One week ago , Oregon Republicans celebrated the recruitment of a promising Senate candidate who is poised to win a crushing primary victory and likely face Sen. Jeff Merkley ( D-OR ) in November . Pediatric neurosurgeon Monica Wehby has run a strong primary race , has a compelling biography , and is moderate enough on social issues to appeal to a center-left Oregon electorate . After several cycles in which the Beaver State 's GOP mounted competitive but unsuccessful statewide campaigns , the party felt like they had finally found a winner . <p> Then , beginning on Friday , a cascade of reports began to emerge in political publications which suggested that Wehby has a manic history with the men in her life . Last week , Politico reported that a former boyfriend of Wehby 's , Andrew Miller , accused her of " stalking " him and " harassing " his employees last year . In a 911 call obtained by Politico , Miller threatened to file a restraining order against Wehby . <p> Those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Oregon news outlets that Wehby had instigated a physical confrontation with her ex-husband as their marriage crumbled . A police report from that altercation indicated that Wehby 's former ex-husband , Jim Grant , sported a " slight red dot " after being reportedly struck with a pad of paper . The episode of violence , both parties claim , was fueled by alcohol imbibed at a December 2007 Christmas party . In 2009 , Grant again called the police on Wehby when she attempted to see the couple 's children and would not leave his home until she did . <p> The carefully crafted image of Wehby as a cogent and measured medical professional was shattered by the reports that cast her , instead , as an erratic , jilted lover prone to fits of violence . But there are some warning signs in these reports which should give gleeful Democratic partisans pause before attacking Wehby for being unstable . <p> Miller never filed a temporary restraining order - a process that is not difficult to pursue and , unlike a final restraining order , does not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Furthermore , " Miller has said he regrets calling police in 2013 , he and Wehby are now friends and he supports her campaign for Senate , " Oregon 's KXL reported . Similarly , the physical altercation between Wehby and her ex-husband , which preceded their divorce , also did not result in criminal or civil charges . <p> Finally , as The Oregonian reported , Politico likely received the tip on Miller 's altercation with Wehby from a research assistant with the Oregon Democratic Party . Aware that the party 's efforts to attack Wehby on personal grounds could backfire , Merkley has denied that he was aware of the effort to uncover his likely opponent 's police records and the state party has declined comment . Wehby 's campaign manager accused the Oregon Democratic Party of waging a " war on women . " <p> It 's a situation that should appear familiar to partisan conservatives who indulged in an ill-advised bit of schadenfreude when similar allegations of domestic violence were made against Rep. Alan Grayson ( D-FL ) . <p> Also amid a messy divorce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in March . Armed with images that she insisted proved her claims , Lolita her husband of slapping her in the face and kneeing her in the stomach . Claiming that this was not the first violent episode , she pursued and received a temporary restraining order against Grayson . The Florida congressman denied the charge against him but , as so often is the case with allegations of domestic violence , the burden of proof fell on the accused . <p> But conservatives who pounced on the charges against the Democratic bomb-thrower ignored the red flags in Grayson 's wife 's allegations , the most glaring of which was that Grayson was never charged criminally in any of the alleged attacks . The congressman later produced the audio of a 911 call and photographic evidence which exonerated him . Within days , Carson-Grayson announced she would drop the restraining order against her husband and pursue reconciliation . Grayson , for his part , accused his wife of bigamy and sought to have his marriage annulled on those grounds . <p> The Grayson saga was personal , bitter , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , are now public . The distinction between these two cases is , however , that Republicans did not seek to discredit Grayson by digging up his personal issues with his wife . The Oregon Democratic Party has , however , endeavored to tar Wehby by digging up police records regarding domestic incidents which cast her in an unfavorable light . <p> It is certain that the nation 's campus feminists could easily append the word " shaming " to the treatment Wehby has endured at the hands of Democrats . The effort to discredit women professionally by bringing up their personal issues , we are so often told , is supposedly a subtle and insidious form of misogyny . While Wehby 's personal issues may not be off limits in the context of a political campaign , a similar incident Grayson faced suggests they should be taken with a grain of salt for now . <p> What this episode demonstrates definitively , however , is that the Democratic Party 's image as protector of the dignity of modern , professional women is easily abandoned when the woman in question @ @ @ @ <p> campaign from

 Texas Police Executing Handcuffed Prisoner <p> Earlier this year a grand jury declined to charge an El Paso police officer in the shooting death of a prisoner .

Saenz had demonstrated that he was capable of reversing his handcuffed arms to the front of his body , the police say , which , along with his body-builder strength , made him a serious threat . <p> In the video you can see that Saenz is clearly resisting the officer 's effort to remove him from the jail , and he reacts violently . Saenz refuses to remain still , even with two men on top of him . At one point as he 's thrown off the prisoner , Flores reaches for his gun , and shoots the man through the shoulder .

The civilian escort 's arm then hits the trigger hand of Officer Flores , causing his weapon to discharge . " <p> Saenz was a competitive bodybuilder and trainer known at gyms across El Paso . An autopsy report said he was 5 feet , 8 inches tall and weighed 217 pounds . The autopsy did not find cocaine , PCP or other hard drugs in his system but reported that Saenz tested positive dimethylamylamine , or DMAA , a substance found in both workout supplements and bath salts synthetic stimulants that can cause paranoia , panic attacks and impaired perception of reality . <p> The old accidental discharge while pointing a gun at a handcuffed man routine .

 Game of Thrones to ' Christ ' <p> The hit show Game of Thrones raises many important questions , like " What is wrong with these people ? " and " Jesus Christ this show ca n't possibly get more bloody , can it ? " But Pastor John posted a list of questions online any decent Christian should ask themselves before watching Game of Thrones . <p> And the first one on the list is a doozy : " Am I Christ ? " And while it seems strange to compare the of Jesus himself to watching a show with murder and titties , there 's actually a very reasonable explanation for why the mere act of watching a TV show is so horrible . <p> He has blood-bought power in his cross . He died to make us pure . He " gave himself for us to redeem us from all lawlessness and to purify for himself a people for his own possession " ( Titus 2:14 ) . If we choose to endorse or embrace or enjoy or pursue impurity , we take a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we do . <p> ( You mean , like how SPOILER almost did with SPOILER in season four ? ) <p> There are , obviously , lots of mentions of the nudity in Game of Thrones and how watching nudity on television " does not advance our holiness " and that it triggers feelings of impurity in men . Oh , and also this question : " Do I Care About the Souls of the Nudes ? " <p> I mean , really , there 's a lot about the nudity . Other questions include " Would I Be Glad If My Daughter Played This Role ? " and " Am I Assuming Nudity Is Necessary for Good Art ? " <p> But , of course , there are plenty of Christians who watch the show anyway , and Piper thinks he knows the reason why . <p> " What keeps those Christians coming back is the fear that if they take Christ at his word and make holiness as serious as I am saying it is , they would have to stop seeing so many television shows and so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

 More Tolerant of Libertarians ? <p> One of the most burning questions the " small-L " libertarian movement perpetually faces is : With whom do we align ourselves ? We generally agree with conservatives on economics , and we generally agree with liberals on social issues . <p> Except even that dichotomy is fraught with a painful amount of nuance . For instance : Conservatives have a terrible track record when it comes to actually following through on fiscal responsibility . They are often obsessed with resisting military budget reductions , and seem less alarmed by government debt and overspending when those concepts fit their needs . And liberals often stray from a " live and let live " attitude on social issues into nannying that 's really just a progressive version of conservative social controls . <p> And that 's just the tip of what has been a decades-long , debate . <p> Generally speaking , however , most people who know of libertarianism have come to know it as " fiscally conservative , socially liberal " people who are " on the right . " Ron Paul was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the libertarian-leaning Rand Paul , is a GOP senator . Reps . Justin Amash and Thomas Massie both represent team R in the Capitol . You do n't see any libertarian Democrats on the national stage , with the exception of Rep. Jared Polis occasionally acting like one on key issues . <p> And so the argument goes : Conservatives are more tolerant of libertarians . And while that may be true in some respects , a new Reason-Rupe poll suggests it 's not so cut-and-dried : <p> Besides libertarians ( obviously ) , liberal millennials indicated the most support for a classically " libertarian-leaning candidate " by a margin of 60 to 27 percent . Conservative millennials , on the other hand , are the most opposed ( 48 percent ) to such a fiscally conservative , socially liberal candidate ( " the presidential equivalent of a unicorn , " perhaps ) . <p> A libertarian-leaning candidate would appeal to both Democratic and Republican voters . For instance , 60 percent of Hillary Clinton voters , 61 percent of Rand Paul voters , 71 percent of Chris Christie voters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Obama all say they would support a fiscally conservative , socially liberal candidate . <p> Also interesting : A plurality of those surveyed millennials who described themselves as " liberal " express incredibly libertarian undertones. 33 percent explained their liberalism as a simple belief in " social tolerance , openness , and personal freedom . " Many of the respondents reportedly said they were liberal because people should have freedom to do what they want in their personal lives without government interference a classically libertarian belief . <p> Of course , this is just one poll , and it would be impossible to attempt to answer this article 's question based on the results alone . But it should provide some more insight , especially when combined with how some conservatives treat libertarians when the going gets tough . <p> Learning is as

Because the U.S. gives financial and military support to Israel , West said that makes President Obama a " war criminal .

" Every human being is made in the image of God . " <p> Later , he extended the " war criminal " charge to the U.S. president .

" <p> The drone issue has long been a point of contention when it comes to West and President Obama .

 10 , 12:20 p.m . ET : CBS just made Colbert 's succession of Letterman official , confirming that the Comedy Central host will take over the Late Show sometime in 2015 .

He credited his ability to slip in and out of character so easily on his time spent at the Second City theater in Chicago . " The rule there , the old saying is ' wear your character as lightly as a cap , ' " Colbert told Russert . " You can take him on and off as you need .

" And I did n't want to ascribe any insincerity to trying to go do this musical at Lincoln Center . Because I knew that I was dealing with somebody else 's delicate product and I did n't want to invest it with my character 's ego .

 corporal punishment had been internalized from slavery practices meant to keep black children from crossing the slave master and incurring a harsher fate , and was now used to prevent African-American children from angering police officers and incurring the same . The result , Dyson said , was a generations-long routinization of black-on-black violence . <p> " Black people were beat and hit in slavery , " Dyson said . " Some slave parents , especially women , had to beat their kids in front of the slave master to prove that they could go along with the slave master 's intention and keep them from being rebellious spirits . ... As a result of that , we began to absorb that practice , collectively speaking , and we 've reproduced it . " <p> " One of the reasons many African American people beat their kids is to prevent them from being beat by their master even worse , " Dyson said . " And one of the reasons we beat our kids so severely now is because we do n't want the police to hurt them later . ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't kill our kids , we of course make sure that the only power we have is to make sure that our kids are behaved correctly .

 of the Highest-Paid People in TV News <p> We continue to hear about the gap between the rich and poor widening in this country , even under a president who vowed to level the playing field for all Americans . <p> The stats are staggering : According to U.S. Census figures , the poverty level in the country is currently at a 50-year high , while the so-called richest one percent have been feasting on the record highs of Wall Street that neither party would dare take credit for . All of this while a record 47 million Americans now receive food stamps , which is almost 13 million more than when President Obama came into office . <p> The pay gap also continues to expand in the world of television news , where the difference between the rich ( mainly anchors/hosts ) and the poor ( production assistants , bookers , associate producers , small-market reporters , etc. ) is just as vast . Which is why it must be painful for some in the business to soak in TV Guide 's annual highest paid list in the news business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the highlights and lowlights : <p> Ronan Farrow currently gets paid per year by the folks at MSNBC . If that number feels familiar , it 's only because Chelsea Clinton reportedly made almost the same amount while working at the Peacock . Only difference ? Despite Mr. Farrow 's struggles , he does show up for work five days a week while hosting his soon-to-go-bye-bye one hour afternoon program . The former First Daughter also had the kind of 24/5 mentality that is required when starting out in television : Of course , that meant in Chelsea 's world working 24 hours a month , five weeks per year in earning her astronomical annual salary . <p> These numbers pale in comparison to what most others in their 20s are raking in while working overnights , weekends and weekend overnights . In speaking with two employees around the same age as Mr. Farrow and Ms. Clinton currently working at two national cable networks , they are each making under as a production assistants .

CBS Evening News anchor Scott Pelley , who is currently third in the Big Three evening newscast race , makes million more than Muir ( Note : Pelley also is a correspondent for the perpetually-highly-rated 60 Minutes , hence the bigger paycheck ) <p> And since Mediaite ventures into the fictional world of political drama on occasion , it should be noted that the great Kevin Spacey gets per episode as Frank Underwood on House of Cards , or less than three cast members of The Big Bang Theory on CBS .

The suit claims the interns worked a 40-hour work week performing many of the same tasks as full-time employees . Similar suits are being filed against programs like The Wendy Williams Show as well . Working for little or nothing is all too-common in the news business particularly on the television side where a hyper-competitive environment keeps entry-level employee costs low . <p> But if you 're one of the few who can make it to the executive or lead anchor/host level , there are n't enough yachts to waterski behind . <p> Such is the wage gap in the television news business , which is something many Americans outside the industry can relate to all too well these days . @ @ @ ! <h>

 six weeks into the Chuck Todd era as moderator of NBC 's Meet the Press . And quite frankly , outside of a strong debut , the mistakes being made both on-set and off have made this second first impression go about as poorly as NBC could have feared . <p> First , the numbers : They 're ugly . Todd debuted at #1 in the demo the week after Labor Day . Since that time , he 's dropped back to the David Gregory position known as a comfortable third . But here 's where things are disturbing if you 're NBC News President Deborah Turness : Over the past two weeks which were heavy , compelling news cycles from Ebola to ISIS to the upcoming midterm elections Meet is down 34 and 30 percent in the demo , respectively . ( Note : We 're not talking being down this much from the Russert era or some kind of high water mark of the past , but from the same time last year , when the Gregory offering was limping along . For context , last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the demo year-to-year while CBS 's Face the Nation was up 13 percent . ) <p> As any respected TV exec will tell you , if this is how a program with an existing brand name , plenty of hype and a new set to match comes out of the gate , it will only perform worse after the new car smell wears off . <p> Off-camera , the decisions have seemingly been misguided and mismanaged . For example , why is Mr. Todd even speaking to Media Matters ? Or Breitbart for that matter ? Both sites are successful and have their own niche audiences that 's not the point , nor is it an indictment on what each provides in terms of content . But as the neutral moderator of the television 's longest-running program , Todd probably should n't sit down publications seen as heavily partisan for the perception it gives alone . Choose Time , AP , Reuters , Bloomberg , Slate , National Journal , even Politico but the more polarizing publications offer no reward . Bad form . The bigger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> As far as the importance of a neutral moderator not making himself the story , well , Chuck keeps jumping in without reservation . Could you ever picture Russert saying he felt " physically i 'll " after one party ( GOP ) used his remarks which were made very publicly and therefore fair game in a campaign ad ? Again , it 's about perception . And if you 're a conservative , you might think twice about just how neutral Todd who otherwise has been accused of bias by both sides , which is usually a sign of playing it straight really is when he editorializes so openly . <p> Another head-scratcher : One of Chuck 's targets in both interviews is Fox News , which Chuck says has an " obsession " about media bias . He also appeared to take aim at Fox News CEO Roger Ailes , stating " it does n't help when any former political operative is involved as a news executive in any form " because " it 's all winning and losing . " <p> Again , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a shrinking Meet the Press audience , is it smart to attack the #1-rated cable news outlet , whose audience loyalty even its critics would agree is easily the fiercest of any network ? Why alienate potentially half your audience ? To quote the immortal Captain Tom " Stinger " Jordan in Top Gun , Chuck 's ego is writing checks his body ca n't cash . <p> Add it all up : <p> One-third of Gregory 's relatively small audience ( compared to CBS and ABC ) has jumped the MTP ship in the past two weeks alone . The show is third and dropping in the Sunday morning talk show race despite a PR push that is clearly doing more harm than good . <p> Todd is speaking out of turn by making himself the focus , and doing so with publications that may further give the wrong impression on being an honest broker . <p> This is n't all on Todd 's shoulders .

 of Americans Disapprove of Obama 's Handling of ISIS <p> A new poll reveals rapidly shifting attitudes towards the conflict against ISIS , with of Americans disapproving of how the Obama administration is dealing with the terrorist threat and even of Democrats disapprove . <p> The poll , conducted by CNN/ORC , noted that this number was up from September , in which of respondents disapproved of Obama 's plan to handle ISIS .

 Lion More Important Than Killing of a Black Man to Cable News <p> The killing of 43-year-old Samuel DuBose by University of Cincinnati police officer Ray Tensing has dominated the news this week , especially since the release of body-cam video showing the shooting . At the same time , the killing of 14-year-old Cecil the Lion by dentist Walter James Palmer has become a worldwide outrage , even spurring a petition to extradite Palmer to Zimbabwe to face criminal charges . Cecil 's killing also resulted in a protest shrine at Palmer 's dental office , which featured a sign that perfectly illustrates the way in which these stories intersect . <p> Right next to the sign imploring Palmer to " Rot in Hell " was a sign featuring the hashtag " #CatLivesMatter , " a play on the #BlackLivesMatter movement that has grown in response to a seemingly weekly series of unarmed black victims of police violence . <p> That misplaced sense of priorities is also evident in the way that cable news has covered the DuBose and Cecil killings this week . According to a database search of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been mentioned 241 times so far this week on cable news ( 41 by CNN , 60 by Fox News , 75 by HLN , and 65 by MSNBC ) , while Sam Dubose has been mentioned a total of 189 times ( 48 by CNN , 12 by Fox News , 32 by HLN , and 99 by MSNBC ) . Even if you subtract Fox News ' 5-to-1 ratio as an outlier , you get a level of coverage that is roughly equal for the killing of a human being and the killing of a wild animal . <p> Even the White House press corps has displayed a similar sense of proportionality , asking several questions about the killing of Cecil the Lion , while only AURN 's April Ryan has asked the White House to weigh in on Sam DuBose 's killing . <p> The disturbing similarities between these two stories do n't end there , though . It 's just the beginning . As Ted Nugent has pointed out , it is legal to kill African lions , but as several recent analyses of police killings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kill African-Americans , too . In an April analysis of thousands of police-involved killings since 2005 , only 54 cases were charged , less than half were convicted , and only 12 times did a fellow officer offer testimony . More recently . The Washington Post 's Wesley Lowery reports that of 559 killings by police so far this year , only four have resulted in officers being charged , and that in all four of those cases , there is video to support the charge . <p> The DuBose killing has been widely posited as yet another reason to require police to wear body cameras ( a policy position that Hillary out months ago ) , and if the string of incidents that we 've seen this past year prove anything , it 's that police officers , even the " good apples , " ca n't be relied upon to intervene against other police officers to protect the public . The familiar refrain that " of cops are good " may apply in most situations , but when it comes to preventing a fellow cop from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or stopping an officer from planting a weapon on Walter Scott , or keeping Freddie Gray safe during a van ride , or telling the truth about what happened to Sam DuBose , there are exactly zero good apples . <p> The only impediment to scot-free killings of black people seems to be video evidence of the incidents , and even then , not really . Despite clear video of the killings of Eric Garner , Tamir Rice , John Crawford , no officers were charged in those incidents , and even in the few cases that have been charged , I would n't bet heavily against the cops . Police body cameras , which enjoy overwhelming support from the public , seem to offer a coin-flip shot at getting killer cops into court , but that 's where these cases run into another obstacle in intensely pro-cop juries . While it 's clear from the video that Officer Tensing lied when he said he was being dragged by DuBose 's car when he fired that deadly shot into his head , by the time a defense attorney gets through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the jury , there 's no telling what they 'll decide . <p> Or maybe there is . In 2011 , South Carolina Police Chief Richard and killed 54 year-old Bernard Baily in a dispute over a broken tail light ticket that Combs had issued to Bailey 's daughter . Combs was finally indicted in the killing in 2014 . The details , minus the existence of video , sound awfully familiar : <p> On May 2 , 2011 , Combs , the then-police chief of Eutawville , shot Bailey three times as he climbed into his pickup truck in the parking lot outside the police station . Bailey was attempting to leave the station after a heated dispute over a broken taillight ticket given by Combs to Bailey 's daughter seven weeks earlier . On that day , Bailey had attempted to intervene on her behalf alongside the road , and Combs later sought a warrant against Bailey for obstruction of justice but did not serve him until Bailey came to Town Hall on May 2 , the day prior to his daughter 's trial . Prosecutors contend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be arrested , Bailey left the office to return to his truck . <p> Combs followed Bailey into the parking lot to make the arrest but said he became caught in the truck 's door when it began to move . He fired in self-defense and not because of Bailey 's race , the former police chief 's defense attorney said during the trial . <p> Pascoe , however , argued that Combs wanted to make a display of arresting Bailey and could have requested backup from other officers . He said also that the truck was not moving and Bailey 's foot was found on the brake pedal . <p> That story was enough to hang a jury in January , and although Combs is about to be retried , his attorney only needs to convince one juror . He 'll ask them " Do you really want a police officer to hesitate , to second-guess himself , when he 's standing between you and a potential threat ?

The whole thing was caught on video , as Groubert ordered Jones to produce his license , and when Jones reached for his license , was shot four times for his trouble : <p> Please enable Javascript to watch . <p> Body cameras are definitely a necessary step , and over time may have an impact on police behavior , but these incidents show that even when they know they 're being recorded , cops are not deterred from making these poor split-second decisions , and lying about it later .

However , that does n't meen that this new parody from the folks over at Landline is any less hilarious . Besides , while it may have missed campaign season , the tons of snow we 've gotten recently makes the idea of Summer attacking Winter in an ad still manages to be plenty timely ! <p> Attack ads are always ripe for parody and , as such , there 's quite a few examples of great riffs by various sketch groups ( this one 's always been one of my favorites ) .

 a government-financed satellite news network , has aired a report linking the suicide bomb attack on the Airport in Moscow Monday with an American video game . According to the report , the airport attack " mirrors " a scenario found in the game Call of Duty : Modern Warfare 2 , which includes a dramatized commando raid on a Moscow airport . As The New York Times explains , the Russia Today report " emphasized that the video game was made by Americans " and includes an interview with Walid Phares , a Fox News terrorism analyst , who suggested that terrorists might " look at the games and say these games will serve them to train . " <p> The Times points out the airport attack in Call of Duty is in reality quite different from the suicide bombing : unlike the suicide bomb , the video game involves a group of attackers entering the airport with automatic weapons and firing at passengers far closer to the 2008 terror attacks in Mumbai.@@3983097 <p> The Family Research 
 Reporter Pat Collins Looks Forward To " 15 Inches Of Fun " <p> You 've really got to feel for reporters sent out to , we suppose , prove that snow has fallen by standing out in several feet of icy coldness . It 's a tough task to make winter snow seem interesting or newsworthy ( Are roads cleared ? Airports open ? School closed ? Must we change out of our Mickey Mouse pajamas ?

 years of President Obama being in power , a good number of Americans have no idea what his religious background is a plurality admitting they have no idea , while an alarming number suggesting he is Muslim . This despite the President discussing his religion publicly and make clear that he is a Christian . Even this latter action , however , seems to be irking some conservatives , like Charles Krauthammer , who considered his recent trips to church " ostentatious " and " somewhat distasteful . " <p> A recent Pew poll showed that a whole of Americans were n't sure what the President 's religious background was , this despite open declarations of Christianity from the Obama family . Tonight 's Special Report did not seem to object to the idea of a president having strong religious beliefs , but Krauthammer in particular was skeptical of the President 's latest appearances in church , and found it somewhat problematic for the President to claim that said appearances were genuine . He particularly objected to the appearance that " there is no connection whatsoever between his late @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand , and the polls that show on the other hand that only a third of Americans think he 's a Christian . Clearly , he 's acting as a politician . " Krauthammer continued to argue that he did not " begrudge " the President that strategy , but nonetheless found it " somewhat distasteful " on a personal level " God is not particularly pleased with public shows of religiosity . " <p> The panel did not unanimously agree , though there was little dissent on the point that President Obama 's religious displays were politically motivated . Stephen Hayes , particularly , agreed with the premise that the Pew poll was behind his latest religious declarations pointing out that he actually found the level of religion coming out of the President lately quite minimal , having expected " that he would be going to church every day " and " carrying the Bible " everywhere . Unlike Krauthammer , however , Hayes did n't " have a problem with him ... if a public official wants to talk about religion , if it 's what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing wrong , " he concluded . He did not succeed in convincing Krauthammer. <h> From the Field

 Perform The Impossible By Publishing A Photo Of Nikki Finke ? <p> Nikki Finke is often referred to as the " most feared " or " most hated " woman in Hollywood , not only for the exclusive gossip she publishes on her industry news site , Deadline.com , but also because , using come combination of wilyness and black magic , she 's managed to accomplish that rarest of feats in today 's online age : make it through her career with only three photos of her available online , one from a college yearbook , a photo of Finke from her debutante days , and the other her fairly ubiquitous black and white headshot . Well , Rupert Murdoch 's fledgling iPad news source , The Daily , may have changed all that . <p> Gawker once offered a reward for a recent photo of Finke or , as they phrased it at the time , " the scourge of industry reporting " but their endeavor ultimately proved fruitless . <p> Now , The Daily has published a photograph of Perhaps Finke , Possibly Maybe , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ car . Their story , by reporter Hunter Walker in the " Flash " section helmed by gossip veteran Richard Johnson , attempts to cover its tracks by asking " Is this the most powerful woman in Hollywood ?

Those asked by The Daily to verify that this woman is indeed Finke each replied that they could n't be sure . <p> Finke , for her part , has publicly ( from the privacy of the home she rarely leaves not that we blame her ) stated that the photo is not of her . But , as The Daily reports , she has called several higher-ups at The Daily 's parent company , News Corp , threatening that her site 's coverage of News Corp 's media outlets might take a negative turn if the photo is not taken down . <p> Finke wrote to Gawker , attempting to set the story straight because , come on , like she 'd be caught dead in a Yaris : <p> What is ' preventing ' the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in fact , it is NOT of me .

There are other details about the photo demonstrating it is not of me . Also , Johnson told me the photo was taken at a time when , in fact , I was not driving any car or outside my home . News Corp has not shown the photo to me . <p> As The Wrap positioned as a rival to Finke 's Deadline reports , Walker ( formerly of The Wrap , now working at The Daily ) had informed Finke 's boss , CEO of Mail Media Corporation Jay Penske , of his plan to hunt down a recent photo of Finke .@@4004455 <h> New Orleans to

 . Elizabeth Spiers : The Anatomy Of A Media Feud <p> From the " What New York Media Types are Fighting About This Week " file comes a ( n ongoing ) feud between Rupert Murdoch biographer and Vanity Fair columnist Michael Wolff and Elizabeth Spiers , Gawker founding editor and current editor in chief of The New York Observer . <p> Wolff , who is not exactly known for being extra chummy with others fighting for air inside the tiny bubble that is media writing , oversaw a column in AdWeek ( he 's the publications ' editorial director ) by staff writer Dylan Byers : " Elizabeth Spiers and N.Y . Observer : Married in Hell ? Can the devil of snark and the boy real estate heir survive each other ? . " The article bemoans ( yet attempts to explain the possible strategy behind ) Spiers ' appointment at The Observer 's helm . Pointing to what he describes as The Observer 's " jaw-dropping downward spiral , " Byers believes that not too many are keen on working for the paper at this juncture , rendering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relevancy . <p> Byers also highlights somewhat gleefully , if we 're reading it correctly the fact that Spiers has been something of a nomad across the media landscape . As evidence , Byers offers Spiers ' own take on her itinerant ways : <p> " I 'm kind of an opportunist in the respect that if a door opened , I would check it out and think about doing it , " she once told The New York Times , putting a positive spin on a career in which she has seldom held a job for more than a year , and in which her professional relationships often come to abrupt and unhappy ends . <p> To further drive home the quixotic nature of her hire , Byers lists a number of anonymous , less-than-glowing reviews by Spiers ' former co-workers " extremely odd , " " toxic , " " one of the strangest people I 've ever interacted with , " " seriously odd smart , nerdy , ironic , idiosyncratic , dark , mysterious , " " makes tongue-tied look hip , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... not quite nailing anything , " has " the attention span and metabolism of a blogger , so she probably ca n't really do much else , " " painfully fucking shy ; she 's painfully fucking arrogant " - painting Spiers as an awkward , high-strung , flaky individual who would n't hold the clout she currently does were it not for the fast-paced , walled-off , snarky nature of online writing today . <p> In the comments section for the AdWeek piece , Page Six columnist Paula Froelich points out that Wolff may not have be the most impartial editor . She writes : <p> This is appalling . That Ad Week would stoop so low as to publish something by Michael Wolff who has long had a feud ( and often been on the losing end ) with Spiers and is the worst gossip I know ( Irony Alert ! I used to deputy edit Page Six , which Spiers was NOT a tipster for , she was actually a freelance writer , regardless , gossip is very hard to write and Wollf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his own name ) . This article is based in personal grudge slinging , not fact . Spiers has been very successful in creating companies , and helping companies flourish . Just ask Conde Nast , b5 media , her original colleagues at Deadhorse , which , if she had stayed on ( and adhered to her original proposal instead of backtracking ) would have sold for millions . Shame on you Ad Week . <p> When it was brought to Froelich 's attention that Wolff was n't actually the piece 's author , she responded by painting the peripatetic nature of Spiers ' career in a different light : <p> well , then I feel sorry for you . MW has never been adept at much except for promoting himself . As for the article , I can continue to poke many holes .. including the fact that Spiers hired Choire , and groomed him for the takeover of Gawker before she left , how is that not creating the tone ? and short lived job stints ? She created companies , then left to own/run her own ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And considering she is very adept at finding and nurturing new talent exactly what the Observer was known for . And sadly , what Ad Week is clearly not under MW . <p> Ouch . <p> Spiers alluded the article on her Tumblr blog by posting Wolff 's Tweeton her Tumblr in advance of the AdWeek piece . " My old friend does n't fair too well in Adweek story posting soon ... alas ... , " he wrote . Ed. note : I had previously linked to Spiers ' Tumblr post about a different AdWeek piece also by Byers , also about troubles at The Observer in which she quotes fellow Gawker vet Doree Shafrir 's thoughts on rumors of bad feeling among . You can read that post here , if you like your media news extra meta . ) <p> Wolff has responded to the controversy , telling New York 's Daily Intel that Byers ' piece was meticulously researched and that " I have been on occasional lunching terms with Elizabeth Spiers friendly terms , as far as I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all ... Her enmity is misplaced . " Daily Intel might also be , however inadvertently , be lending credence to Byers ' and/or Wolff 's hesitation over the hire by offering this amusement little tidbit : <p> In the meantime , we hear Spiers is trying to make it more amusing on the basic style level . All writers have been asked to rewrite a New York Times article in " the Observer house style " by Friday . It 's been a few years since former editor Peter Kaplan steered the paper 's prose into the chatty , arch tone for which the paper became famous , so we hear no one there now has a clue what she 's talking about . <p> What 's particularly awkward about tiffs of this sort among those in media is that everyone is constantly rubbing shoulders and writing about one another it 's a small , small , incestuous world after all while others , mostly those also inside that little media bubble , look in . Or gawk , as it were . It behooves those involved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helps draw in eyeballs and attention now Wolff 's name is nearly inextricably tied to Spiers ' and , as her success either grows or wanes , his reaction will be sought .

And with other potential candidates and Fox News employees ( Sarah Palin , Mike Huckabee and John Bolton ) being warned by the network that " as soon as each of them shows some serious intention to form an exploratory committee " similar action will be taken , one thing is clear : Fox News ' strategy to secure so many compelling newsmakers was a very smart business decision , and one that we might likely see more of in the future . <p> Any criticism of the arrangements seems to gloss over the fact that nearly everyone involved comes out a winner . Fox News received nearly exclusive access to national persons of interest , while each of the Republican candidates secures for themselves a platform to continually reach the largest and most favorable cable news audience .

Why watch pundits on another channel talk about Palin or Huckabee , when instead you can turn on Fox and hear directly from the source ?

While such a practice is great for ratings , it does no favors to dispel allegations of Fox 's right-leaning bias . Even though Huckabee is the only host of a show and the rest are merely guests in a stable of rotating commentators , with so many powerful conservative contributors to the network , defenders of the " fair and balanced " slogan have to be disappointed that the most prominent liberal contributor with a similarly political background is Joe Trippi . <p> Moving forward , it seems like a new era is upon us , one where in future election cycles it will be commonplace for all cable news channels to compete for the exclusive access of likely presidential candidates , so that never again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Therefore , in 2013 do n't be surprised to see Jeb Bush , possibly even Hillary Clinton and many others be the subject of bidding wars between news channels as a career in punditry benefits all while a candidate mulls their presidential prospects . <h> LA goes

 List Of Reports From Around The World ( UPDATED ) <p> Just a few hours ago , Japan was hit with an 8.9 magnitude earthquake , one of the largest in the country 's recorded history . It struck the northeast coast at 2:46 pm local time ( 12:46 am EST ) . 250 miles away in Tokyo , the BBC 's Roland Buerk reported that being on the street was like " walking across the deck of a ship at sea . " Soon after , the earthquake caused a deadly tsunami that is affecting areas as widespread as Russia and the western coasts of North and South America . Below are some of the many reports from the destruction . ( IMPORTANT UPDATE AT BOTTOM ) <p> CNN has enabled a live online feed with Japanese affiliate NHK . Watch here . BBC News has an incredibly useful ticker running and being updated frequently . They recently reported that the United States should be safe from any serious damage as the tsunami passed through Hawaii without major effect . <p> Fox News also quoted them as saying that an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hit near Nobiru Station .

" According to this report , all American military personnel have been accounted for without serious injury and are now organizing for relief efforts in the country . <p> The New York Timesquoted President Obama as saying " Michelle and I send our deepest condolences to the people of Japan . " BBC News quotes this message from Queen Elizabeth II to the Emperor of Japan : " Prince Philip joins me in extending our heartfelt sympathy to your majesty and the people of Japan . Our prayers and thoughts are with everyone who has been affected by the dreadful disaster . " <p> Tons of incredible and terrifying video footage taken by people on the ground is showing up online .

Some news outlets are still using 88,000 , but we 've taken that figure out of this post and any other post and will await a more certain tally . <p> At this point , the world can mostly await the damage reports and prepare relief for the areas affected . <h> Daylight Saving Time 
 a former Saturday Night Live cast member , is blasting Glee , calling the show " sickening " after last week 's episode , which included a kiss between two gay characters . In a post on conservative blog WorldNetDaily.com , Jackson says the show " made a mockery of Christians .

" And then she proceeds to say a lot about Muslims , Glee , progressives and even CBS Evening News anchor Katie Couric , suggesting they all share a single objective : <p> Why do liberals embrace Shariah law even though " beheading your wife " seems to go against the feminist movement 's mantra ? Why do liberals embrace Islam knowing it frowns on homosexuality ? <p> Because they have the same goals . Progressives , communists , liberals , globalists and Muslims want to destroy America .

And , besides shoving the gay thing down our throats , they made a mockery of Christians again ! I wonder what their agenda is ? Hey , producers of " Glee " what 's your agenda ?

 Wiz once said " Pay no attention to the man behind the curtain , " but we believe that what happens behind the TV screen is important to understanding what ends up on it . In today 's inaugural installment of Mediaite In the Control Room , we bring you the insights of Bill Wolff , the Executive Producer of Rachel Maddow Show , as he talks about what makes the show tick , and where it fits in the cable news landscape . <p> In addition to being TRMS 's Executive Producer , Bill Wolff is also Vice President , Primetime Programming , for MSNBC . He came to the network in 2005 to handle the " other " Situation , the one Carlson , following stints with Fox Sports Network and ESPN , where he created Around the Horn . Before that , Wolff spent several years writing screenplays for Dimension Films and Dreamworks , including the 2005 Martin Lawrence vehicle Rebound . <p> A St. Louis native and Harvard College graduate , Wolff cut his teeth as an intern at NBC affiliate KSDK , and later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Los Angeles Bureau Producer for ESPN on shows like Sportscenter , Outside the Lines , and NFL Countdown . <p> In our exclusive interview , Bill Wolff talks about The Rachel Maddow Show 's strengths , their position in the cable news landscape , and the dividing line between " opinion " media and hard news . <p> Mediaite : What would you say is TRMS 's mission statement ? <p> Bill Wolff : We 're not big on mission statements , I 'll confess , but , pressed to come up with one , I 'd say : TRMS seeks every night to increase the amount of useful information in the world and to enunciate accurate , original narratives based solely on that information . <p> Q : How do you avoid falling into a trap of trying not to feel redundant , and coming up with new things ? <p> BW : It is a challenge not to repeat one 's self for anybody who 's doing a show every day . One thing that helps is that the news is always changing in unexpected ways . Another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exceptional . <p> Q : How important a role does humor play on your show ? <p> BW : Working the sort of hours we work on the sorts of subjects we report , humor is critical to getting through every day . <p> Q : I 've been a fan of Rachel 's since day 1 at Air America , and so I recognize much of TRMS tone and cadence to be distinctly . What 's the Bill Wolff imprint on the show ? <p> BW : We do n't take our good fortune for granted , and that 's the frame of mind we try to maintain as a group . If we truly enjoy what we 're doing and have fun while we 're doing it , the show will reflect that , and that will be a positive thing . <p> It 's also critical to have great players up and down a team 's line-up , and we 've tried to assemble and develop a group of great producers who understand the show 's tone and sensibility and who work well together . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and grateful every day . They 're all smart as hell , selfless and motivated and conscientious , well-informed , and great to be around . <p> Q : Lawrence O'Donnell compared Countdown to a series of op-ed pieces . TRMS seems more like a political essay that unfolds over the course of the week , or longer . Is that conscious , and is it a tough format to stick to in the age of bite-size news ? <p> BW : Our show 's best asset the thing that gives us competitive advantage in the marketplace is Rachel 's analytic ability . There are very , very few people in any medium with her skills . Thus , the format of the show is devised to capitalize on that advantage by highlighting and amplifying the things Rachel does better than anybody else . <p> Q : You recently were quoted as saying that MSNBC has no partisan agenda , but that seems to run counter to both public and comments made by Phil Griffin who said of MSNBC 's shift in strategy , " It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " concluding " a vision of smart progressives just began to emerge . " Can you clarify your comments ? <p> BW : I was confronted with the statement by an interviewer that MSNBC has " an agenda . " I said that was n't true . My understanding of an " agenda " is that it means an enunciated set of political goals to achieve . We do n't have that or anything like it . <p> Q : Do you think TRMS is in striking distance of Hannity , ratings-wise , and how soon do you think you might overtake them ? <p> BW : Some nights we 're pretty close , other nights we 're not as close . Fox News deserves a ton of respect for their commercial success . <p> Q : I 've noticed the show taking more frequent shots at Fox News , particularly Megyn Kelly . Is that part of a strategy to challenge Fox directly , a coincidence , or just my imagination ? <p> BW : Not part of a strategy . We address things that happen in the news @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of what we do when what they do becomes part of the news . <p> Q : What do you make of the distinction , often raised by Fox News , between hard news and opinion programming ? Do you feel that separation at MSNBC , and is there a difference in standards between the two " breeds ? " <p> BW : There really is n't a difference in the standards of accuracy . Hard news and opinion/analysis are both required to have all of the information verified and accurate . Factual errors bear correction in all cases . The fundamental commodity in any news enterprise is credibility , and that axiom applies across the board in every format . <p> Q : At the last two CPACs , many prominent conservative media figures and politicians have told me , privately , that they really like Rachel , and enjoy TRMS . Does this surprise you , and to what do you attribute this secret admiration ? <p> BW : It 's nice to hear . I think it reflects what Rachel puts out there . We , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure we 've got the facts straight , and Rachel is devoted to being fair . <p> Q : In your with , you made several valid points about mistakes they made on your Wisconsin budget coverage . One thing they failed to mention is that TRMS claimed that Wisconsin had both a surplus and a deficit , simultaneously . Is n't that impossible ? <p> BW : It is impossible to have a deficit and a surplus simultaneously . However , it is possible to have a current surplus but be facing liabilities which project that your budget will have a deficit moving forward . <p> Q : Do you think Keith Olbermann 's Current TV show could establish a programming bloc that would cannibalize your audience ? <p> BW : Our goal remains the same focus on being awesome at what we 're doing . <h> In Search Of 
 Day : Joe Biden Calls For Obama 's Impeachment ? <p> A diverse gaggle of online media outlets ( from Drudge and Hot Air to Wonkette and HuffPo ) are enamored with the idea that a series of 2007 speeches that Joe Biden gave regarding the possible impeachment of George W. Bush are now applicable to President Obama 's Libya policy.With varying degrees of shrillness , they 're playing " Gotcha ! " with Biden 's promise that a unilateral move to war with Iran would be met with impeachment , and applying that promise to Obama 's Libya policy . The premise is based on a legal memo that Biden talked about on the stump in 2007 , augmented with the following two YouTube clips : <p> I am not one , who if you 've observed me for some time , I am not one who 's engaged in excessive populist rhetoric . I 'm not one that pits the rich against the poor . I 'm not one who 's gone out there and made false threats against presidents about , and god love him he 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everybody now . <p> Now , it 's important to realize that there 's no way in the wide world that President Barack Obama is going to get impeached over this . As Dave Weigel pointed out Tuesday , the prevailing attitude in Congress over the matter of congressional approval is best exemplified by the statements made by Sens . Lindsey Graham ( R-S.C. ) and Jack Reed ( D-R.I. ) , who each basically said they 'd simply rubber-stamp whatever Obama wanted to do . " I 'd be glad to vote on it afterwards , " said Graham , all but cementing Congress ' ornamental role in military conflict . <p> Despite some superficial similarities between the two situations , it 's also a poor comparison . Biden was talking about a unilateral , full-scale attack on Iran , not a UN-led no-fly zone , for which there is plenty of precedent . Whether the latter is a good idea is a subject for legitimate debate , but it 's just not the same thing . <p> That said , though , this meme fits in with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , from a wide range of sources , to President Obama 's Libya policy , making strange bedfellows of people like Michael Moore and Rudy Giuliani . On its face , there 's nothing wrong with this , it 's even a little bit healthy for such a vigorous debate to take place , but a lot of it is scattershot nonsense and hyperbole . The criticisms the President faces are so varied , it 's tough to know where to even start the conversation , and this silly comparison of Bush and Obama is just another example of that . <h> Does the Internet 
 first draft is typically filled with errors that need to be paved over , which is why it can be extremely embarrassing if these drafts ever make it out into the harsh gaze of the public 's eye . What can be more embarrassing is if those " errors " are actually " descriptive language " that some might find racially insensitive . That 's what happened in Tennessee as the Nashville Scene has apologized for a review of In the Heights , the hit musical set in New York 's diverse Washington Heights neighborhood , that many readers and theater fans called " racist . " The Nashville Scene 's editor has written a statement saying the review was merely a first draft that got published by accident . <p> So what did the original review say ? Well , from the beginning , critic Martin Brady seemed to be debating Broadway 's insistance on giving every ethnic group a musical ( he began the review : " What will the American musical do for thematic material when the melting pot has completely turned to ethnic mush and no group @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the beginning of an interesting argument if it were n't phrased so antagonistically ( darn " underprivileged " folks ! ) . It would also be more appropriate around the time that , like , Fiddler on the Roof was coming out . Our " ethnic musicals " really that popular in 2011 ? Is there anyone out there really rejoicing because , finally , the nation 's spidermen and women have their own show to sing along to ? <p> The review continued in that frame : <p> " Creator Lin-Manuel Miranda 's story book by Quiara ? a Hudes tells of a vibrant community in New York 's Washington Heights neighborhood , ' where the coffee from the corner bodega is light and sweet , the windows are always open and the breeze carries the rhythm of three generations of music . ' In other words , an excuse to employ dynamic youthful minority performers who dance and sing and holler to a lot of salsa music and groove on lyrics about Latin loving and partying . " <p> As this reader pointed out , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that really ticked people off . <p> " But if you like your ing ? nues brown and leggy and your music ' hot , hot , hot , ' this is the show for you . " <p> Yeah , no matter what the intentions were , that 's the kind of thing most editors would put the kibosh on . So how did the review get online ? This was Nashville Scene 's editor Jim : <p> " An unedited first draft of Martin Brady 's Critics ' Pick of In the Heights ran by accident in the online edition of the Nashville Scene . As is the case here , first drafts are places for writers to work out ideas that should often be discarded before they ever see the light of day . Instead , the uncorrected piece was published online , and many commenters were offended by the descriptive language in the piece concerns that were raised with the author during the editing process , and which , to his credit , he apologized for and agreed to change . The Scene apologizes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my own personal apology as well and accept responsibility for the error . " <p> So these were " ideas " that needed to be " discarded ? " How odd . Oh well , I guess I should just be glad , again , that I write for a website that never feels any need to censor the thoughts of its staff . <p> Editor 's Note:This post has been edited from an earlier form . Like many of Mr. Bershad 's articles , it was filled with strange and unnecessary references to his distrust of the people of Norway . Normally we take these out before posting , but , somehow , these were missed . The comments were offensive and had absolutely nothing to do with the topic at hand . We apologize to any readers who were offended . Particularly any Norwegian readers . No one at Mediaite believes you are " all murderous vikings .

 silver lining , no " good side , " nothing remotely redeeming about the atrocious devastation the earthquake earlier this month and subsequent tsunami in Japan submitted that nation 's people to , but even in the darkest of news stories there sometimes arises a story that inspires some good feelings . Rescue workers saved a dog today that had been floating out at sea for the three weeks since the tsunami , alive and as well as can be expected . <p> Officials do n't yet know how the dog survived without food or fresh water , but , shockingly , they found the dog in relatively good health with high prospects of surviving and living a full life . As with all the Japan tsunami news , that 's where the good part ends rescuers are searching for his owner or , perhaps , a new home for the pup , but the odds are as slim that the dog 's life will return to normalcy as it is for the thousands of displaced humans caught up in this situation .@@4075251 <p> I am writing 
 fun of Rebecca Black all you 'd like , but who was performing your music when you were 13 ? To the list of people now culturally bound to her hit ( ? ) single " Friday " we can now add Stephen Colbert and Jimmy Fallon , who , along with The Roots , the Knicks City Dancers , some guy in a Bigfoot outfit , and American Idol winner Taylor Hicks for some reason , performed the most over-the-top rendition of the tune yet . <p> While reinterpreting " Friday " a song that , should the Mayans be right about the world ending in 2012 , will define pre-apocalyptic humanity forever is enough of an artistic statement in itself , there was some method to the madness .

 secret that whenever Stephen Colbert claims to a " big fan " of somebody , he 's setting himself up to absolutely rail on his target . In these instances , Colbert is like a giant truck , backing up to unload an enormous heap of scorn , though pleasantly delivered with his uniquely detached irony and absurdly amplified delivery .

 to say that most of us have been tempted to get out of jury duty by pretending to be a little more hateful / insane / insanely hateful than we truly are , but we generally have the good sense to know that playing up biases takes a certain level of finesse : In other words , hating everyone seems a little suspect , unless you happen to be a television pundit .

In a moment that seemed unintended for discussion on air Perino at first insisting the tie was " lovely " until Hannity forced it ultimately led to a full-on question and answer session , and clearly producers wanted to bring it up , since they had time to grab a shot of the tie and produce a side-by-side logo graphic . <p> HANNITY : And joining me now with reaction from the Fox Business Network , the host of " Varney &amp; Company , " Stuart Varney and former White House Press Secretary , Fox News contributor Dana Perino . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> DANA PERINO , FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR : Nothing .

 Wolff On The Irrelevance Of Media Reporters <p> Adweek has recently undergone an image overhaul , merging Adweek , Mediaweek and Brandweek into one , single brand and honing its focus in on the intersection of advertising , marketing and media . We spoke with Adweek 's editorial director , Michael Wolff , about the brand 's changes ... and on what he thinks about media reporters . ( Hint : He may or may not find them " completely irrelevant . " ) Ed. note : Update at bottom <p> Wolff explained that the decision to fold Mediaweek and Brandweek into Adweek comes from focusing " not about the subject so much as the brand , " with Adweek being the much better known , and more successful , of the brand 's former titles . <p> We 'd noted that the official press release about the brand 's changes focused quite a bit on Wolff himself , as had the bulk of media coverage surrounding Adweek . Was this , we wondered , a conscious decision to equate the Adweek brand with one particular personality ? <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ editor . I have to take responsibility , whether it 's a win or a lose . " He added that he feels magazines definitely " should have strong editors " who are willing to speak of and essentially become " the face " of the magazine . <p> In the past , Wolff has continually brushed off comparisons between Adweek and AdAge another ad-focused publication . In fact , a recent Yahoo write-up about Adweek 's revamp quoted The Observer 's Elizabeth Spiers who , it 's worth noting , became embroiled in a particularly nasty feud with Wolff . Said Spiers : " You 're not going to compete with rival trade AdAge by having Michael pick fights with small circulation regional newspapers . " Wolff , however , insists the two magazines are not " rivals " in the least . AdAge , he argues , is a trade publication , and Adweek is decidedly not . <p> " The trade category has problems , " he says . " It 's too niche , and general business too broad . " Adweek , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ journalism . " It will tell the story of this industry , " Wolff continues . In this way , he believes his magazine is more like , say , Fortune than AdAge . <p> But , seeing how Mediaite is n't terribly invested in the advertising world or day-to-day operations of magazines ( as beautiful and plump as the new issue of Adweek happens to be ) , we wanted to know a little more about the media 's contentious relationship with Mr. Wolff . <p> Covering media , we tend to gauge our own little bubble 's thoughts and reactions to news items through twitter , where we noticed that the general consensus among media reporters seemed to focus , primarily on Wolff rather than on the magazine itself , and that this reaction had ... a negative tinge , to put it mildly . We asked Wolff whether he sees a difference in the way the ad industry views Adweek versus how media reporters view the brand , pointing out that the revamp was generating negative buzz on Twitter . <p> Wolff believes that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been overwhelmingly positive , and his focus is on his readers , not " the 26 people writing about media . " As he sees it , " Most people writing about media have no idea what they 're talking about . " Ed. note : Gasp ! , thought the media writer for Mediaite . First , Keith Olbermann announces my co-workers and I do n't have real jobs , and now Wolff believes my ilk is good for nothing . Also , totally chipped some dishware yesterday . It 's been a bad week . ) Yahoo ! noted Wolff 's sometimes contentious relationship with those inhabiting the media world : <p> Of course fighting is what Wolff is known for . Here he is butting heads with Rupert Murdoch ; sparring with former publishing doyenne Judith Regan ; shooting spitballs on the grave of late Upper East Side restaurateur Elaine Kaufman ; getting kicked out of at least 10 other restaurants in that neighborhood , where he used to live . <p> And , Wednesday , mediabistro 's FishbowlNY blog Ed. note : Full disclosure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Wolff that ... well . Got a lil ' tense : <p> US : " Wait . We got ta discuss the typo on the cover before you go . " <p> HIM : " Actually , you already passed up your opportunity to ask that . " <p> US : " What does that mean ? You wo n't discuss it ? " <p> HIM : " No . That 's YOUR story . " <p> US : " Can you at least explain it to the audience ? That 's a pretty big typo , and people are talking about it . " <p> HIM : " No . That 's YOUR story . " <p> US : " Ok . Well , let 's ask a couple more general questions just so we have enough content for the final video . " <p> But Wolff is n't losing sleep over it . " They are of absolutely no concern or interest to me , " he says . " They 're completely irrelevant . They have no audience , make no contribution . " <p> So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staffers whose numbers will soon rise from 32 to 50 ? " Here , reporters are covering a beat , and they do an honest job , " explained Wolff . " Unlike Jeff Bercovici . " <p> We asked Bercovici to comment . First , he pointed us to an article he 'd published ( , while he was still at Aol ) which documented a particularly heated exchange between the two : <p> I ran this scenario by Wolff , whose unpleasant personal manner is so famous as to be perversely endearing . " Let 's not have this conversation , " he said . When I pressed him for a comment , he reminded me of a story I wrote last year saying that he was preparing a column for Vanity Fair about how his personal life had become gossip fodder for the New York Post a column that was never published . I asked him why he 'd brought that up . " I 'm saying get some stuff right for once , " he snapped , and hung up the phone . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time that he was writing the column , but cautioned that it was a work in progress and might not turn out as I expected . ) He did n't respond to a follow-up email seeking clarification , and an E5 spokeswoman was unable to she 'd any light . <p> " The upshot is , " Bercovici told us via email , " a couple of times now , he 's gotten pissed at me because I wrote about something he had in the works before he was ready to talk about it . I think if you follow the links and read the items in question , you 'll see that everything I wrote was 100 percent accurate . So unless he has some other example of my supposed dishonesty , I 'd say it 's just him being thin-skinned . " <p> One thing , at least , if for certain where Wolff is concerned : If it 's true that all publicity is good publicity , then the man most certainly knows how to market himself . <p> As for Adweek , the reinvigorated magazine 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this article noted that Wolff had mentioned he 'd " neglected to hire " Bercovici , a claim Bercovici denies . In an effort to determine whether we 'd misheard Wolff , we followed up with him via Adweek . When asked to clarify , Adweek said the publication does not discuss those it has neglected to hire . When it was pointed out that Wolff may not have been referring to Adweek specifically , a spokesperson for the magazine relayed that Wolff never said he had neglected to hire@@4103575 <p> As industrial robots 
 9/11 Conspirators Actions Revealed By Wikileaks <p> In the wake of the 9/11 attacks , the United States government , the media and the world became consumed with the whereabouts of anyone who might have been connected to the 9/11 attacks . It was a consumption that paid off when many of the so-called masterminds were captured or killed one by one in the months and years after the attacks . But the details of exactly what many of them were doing with their time and where they were doing it remained a public mystery until now , courtesy , of course , of Wikileaks . <p> Wikileaks , which has become the scourge of this administration by releasing hundreds of thousands of pages of classified documents , released this latest cache to various news outlets . It included information on almost all of the the 779 individuals who have been held at Guantanamo Bay , Cuba since 2002 . The most fascinating details involve Osama Bin Laden , His deputy Ayman al-Zawahiri and some of the other top Al Qaeda leaders . Some of the highlights ( via Washington Post @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were planning numerous other attacks in the months after the attacks but decisions about where to attack and who would be involved led to major in-fighting . <p> When Bin Laden and Al-Zawahiri escaped from Tora Bora in December 2001 , Bin Laden was broke and had to borrow . <p> In those first post 9/11 months , Bin Laden traveled by car in Afghanistan , and gave out assignments for fear that he would be captured <p> On 9/11 most of the Al Qaeda leaders were in Karachi , Pakistan watching television images of the World Trade Center attacks . <p> The documents also offer moment-by-moment details gathered from interviews with many of the Guantanamo detainees about Khalid Sheik Mohammed , Ramzi Binalshibh and other 9/11 plotters . While the administration wo n't be happy about the release of these documents and has already expressed dismay , they probably will not have anywhere near the sort of deleterious effect that the individual secret cables had on various diplomatic relationships . @ @ @ @ @ 
 where the mainstream media is in covering the brouhaha over Wonkette 's birthday attack on Trig Palin ( since deleted ) , CNN 's Reliable Sources answered the call Sunday morning . Host Howard Kurtz gave a quick recounting of the offensive post ( and perhaps too much credit for an apology ) , and while the panel unequivocally disapproved , the discussion was disappointingly superficial . Kurtz pulled a few choice quotes from the post , saying that Wonkette mocked 3 year-old Trig Palin as " retarded , " " somewhat alive , " and " perhaps not really Sarah Palin 's child , " then explains how the site initially stood by the post , but once advertisers began to desert the site in response to an online campaign , deleted the post and " apologized for poor comedic judgment . " <p> Clarence Page talked about the " normally delightful " comeuppance of Wonkette at the hands of their " lack of experience " in not knowing that you do n't go after the kids . Adweek 's Michael Wolff called Wonkette " tone deaf , " and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Low Blow : An apology for mocking Trig " appeared . <p> Cumulatively , the effect was a failure to convey the true character of the Wonkette post , which was " tone deaf " in the way that a punch in the balls is " impolite , " and the apology , which was of debatable sincerity and completeness . <p> The segment was also disappointing because it did n't ask any of the deeper questions that this story begs . Chief among them is the power of the Twitter boycott , and the question of whether such boycotts are necessarily a good thing . While it 's not surprising that Andrew Sullivan has reservations , so do some who support the boycotters in spirit . <p> Additionally , while comparing this episode with others where politicians ' children were insulted , it would have been natural to discuss the ways in which this attack crossed lines that the others did n't . Finally , with advertising expert Wolff on hand , why not delve into the practical consequences of a boycott ? <p> In any case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't getting the attention it deserves , but is right in Kurtz 's wheelhouse .

 Sunday episode of This Week was titled " God and Government " and focused on the unique relationship between " politics and the pulpit " according to host Christiane Amanpour . The early part of the show featured discussions with a variety of religious leaders ( at least one of whom sounded a lot like a Birther ) , but the later half featured a roundtable discussion about Barack Obama 's faith and the perception by some that the president is actually Muslim ( supported by a poll that indicates that a fifth of America think believes so . ) Cokie Roberts explained the reason why : Americans are racist . <p> ROBERTS , C. : But but the bad part about this is that he that that it 's acceptable to say that he 's a Muslim ... <p> EBOO PATEL , INTERFAITH YOUTH CORE : That 's right . <p> ROBERTS , C. : ... because the same people wo n't wo n't say , " I do n't like him cause he 's black .

" <p> To be clear , Roberts was n't calling all Americans racist , she was simply explaining why some Americans believe Obama is Muslim despite his repeated claims of being Christian .

 Google Of Sexism With WNBA Search Results <p> In a funny clip from last night 's Sports Show with Norm MacDonald , the comedian accused Google of sexism ! The reason ?

Sure , Google , maybe if I had typed " , " there would have been a mistake , but anything else and you 're just projecting ! <p> Of course , MacDonald is only kidding . Google 's algorithms are merely responding to the fact that many more people search " NBA " on a regular basis and the computer only sees " WNBA " as a potential one-letter typo instead of its own thing . However , I 'm gon na bet that with this clip of MacDonald as well as a Twitter campaign ( ) , someone over at Google headquarters will have rushed to fix the little error by the end of the day . What other sports-themed comedy shows can lay claim to that kind of social change , huh ?

Beyond the presence of the unsettling cast , the story line , which revolves around a trapeze artist marrying a midget for his money , preceded strict enforcement of Hollywood 's Production Code , when sexual innuendo and violence were considered acceptable . In the full version of the movie 's climax , the " freaks " descend upon the trapeze artist and mutilate her . One audience member blamed the film for causing her miscarriage . <p> Freaks has had a lasting impact on American culture , or , perhaps more accurately , subculture .

Celebrating absurdity and non sequitors , it 's often baffling and rarely funny but regularly amusing . <p> Which was the goal of the old side shows , too , of course not to invoke laughs but instead bewildered amusement . The freaks were meant to send a chill down your spine , meant to get the girl you liked to bury her head into your shoulder . In a world without 4chan , they were all frisson , no irony . <p> As you may know , there still exists a sideshow at Coney Island , but , being in Brooklyn , it 's populated mostly by self-aware hipsters , exchanging their dignity for cachet .

In the year that we lived there , 2007 , the blocks-long Feast of San Gennaro took over the parking lot across the street , transforming it into a side show for the duration of the nine-day festival . <p> This being New York City in early September , it was hot , meaning we needed to keep our windows open .

We turned a quick corner , and there she was not exotic , not interesting , just a tiny person sitting on a pillow , grinning broadly and grasping for any money we might care to offer . It was shockingly banal . We smiled , greeted her awkwardly , and left .

 Slut <p> The name may sound sweaty and vaguely recall the scent of old cabbage , but , you guys , we 're officially entering " The Summer of Sluts . " <p> Since one and a half instances of something happening in the public eye equals a trend , we can thank MSNBC 's Ed Schultz for giving this summer its pleasantly alliterative title . You 'll recall that Schultz recently called radio host Laura Ingraham a " right-wing slut , " an offense that was taken in stride by Ingraham , who accepted Schultz 's subsequent apology , but one that resulted in a week-long suspension for the liberal pundit . <p> It was , interestingly , MSNBC.com that pointed to that incident , as well as the recent wave of Slut Walks " inspired by one police officer 's insensitive comment , as the impetus behind this Summer of : <p> The walks , which began in April after a Toronto police officer advised women in a York University audience not to dress like a " slut " to avoid sexual assault , are not only attempting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the meaning of " slut . " <p> This is a delicate topic to discuss , but it 's one well worth the effort . So here we go . <p> I am all for treating language as something that lives and changes with time , and I think it 's totally possible to alter the meaning or connotation of words to great effect . For example , I think Bitch magazine has done a great job of taking a pejorative term that seeks to equate ambitious , confident women with a lower being and turning it into a badge of pride for its readers . The meaning of the term " bitch " may not have changed in society at large because of one feminist magazine , but it does represent the reality that some women wo n't allow themselves to be subjected to sexist language . Human skidmarks have the freedom to hurl unsavory language my way should I elect not to respond to their coos of " Hey mama , what 's good ? " and I have the freedom to choose not to be bothered by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I have the freedom to be very bothered by it , and to try and turn a bad situation into a positive by speaking out . <p> So , good for that ! <p> Now , I consider myself a feminist , while fully realizing that capital F Feminism , as a movement , has many flaws and that the term feminism contains so many variations and inconsistencies and subgroups so as to be rendered almost meaningless , but , hey . I believe we live in an unjust , patriarchal society and women can and should assert themselves in a way to achieve a greater balance . I also believe that women should n't be coddled or infantilized by society , and that this means taking responsibility for ourselves and our decisions . <p> When women are raped and harassed and catcalled , it 's not the fault of women . Repeat : It is not the victim 's fault . But walking with a designer purse brimming with cash in a dark alley at 3 in the morning is placing myself in a dangerous situation , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and leave me alone , because that person is n't a thief . But my decision makes me vulnerable to those who are thieves , and to those who would take advantage of me in this situation because , you know . They can . Women should be able wear what we 'd like without fear of being assaulted or attacked or belittled , but this is n't the reality of how the world we live in works , and so it 's up to us to remain aware . ( In fact , my favorite protest sign ever comes from one such slut walk . Here it is . ) <p> That said , I think a lot of men and many women do n't realize that catcalls and harassment are not the result of an outfit . Men bother women wearing short skirts and tight dresses , and they bother women wearing bulky winter coats and worn-out snow boots . They harass young women , they harass older women . They assault conventionally attractive women , and those less so . They go after drunk women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complete strangers , and , more often than not , they go after women they know . <p> These so-called " Slut Walks " are positive in that they very publicly and very loudly assert that women and their male allies are n't going to stand for being patronized by one police officer or by a whole system . But this issue is n't black and white , and dictating the reactions of others is nearly impossible , while educating others might eventually get us somewhere . <p> Here is what one organizer has to say about the walks : <p> " We have taken up the word slut ... to claim that a slut does not have to remain a pejorative and demeaning epithet , " Toronto Slut Walk organizer Heather Jarvis told me . " A slut can be someone who is in control and unashamed of their sexuality .... A slut can be someone who is unafraid to enjoy consensual sex . A slut can be someone who refuses to believe ... that enjoying sex or owning one 's sexuality is an invitation of violence . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these walks . <p> Enjoying sex =/= dressing in any particular way . You can be a proud slut in a pair of jeans , and be a woman in a tight dress who , you know , enjoys being fashionable , but just does n't really enjoy sex all that much . Saying that " dressing like a slut " means someone is proudly and loudly asserting her sexuality only works to bolster the idea that women dress a certain way in order to gain sexual attention , as opposed to because it 's fashionable or because New York City turns into a festering pit of heat and humidity in the summertime . <p> And then there 's the reality that there 's no real male equivalent for the word " slut . " Using this word as either a source of pride or empowerment , or even as a seemingly innocuous term of endearment among friends ( " ' Sup , slut ? Can you untag me in that Facebook picture where I look like a baby rhino ? Much obliged , you silly whore . Kisses . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women and men are perceived when it comes to sex and sexuality . <p> So , here are my plans for the summer : I 'm going to continue to dress and behave in a way that feels comfortable for me . I 'm going to continue to get catcalled from time to time , and I 'm going to either ignore it , internalize it , or lash out at it , depending on how I 'm feeling at that particular moment . I 'm going to make sure not to put myself in particularly dangerous or vulnerable situations , while remaining aware that there is still no way of fully knowing which guys out there pose a threat to me . <p> And I 'm probably not going to be referring to myself as a slut anytime soon . But , hey . More power to you if you choose to .@@4155532 <h> City boy ,

 were wondering what the wife of the soon-to-be-former New York Times executive editor Bill Keller thinks about his resignation ( And who has n't ? ) , Vanity Fair is here to help . The magazine gave Emma Gilbey Keller a bit of real estate to write about how her husband 's occupation has impacted life her life as well as those of their two daughters , Alice and Molly . <p> This this knitting of headlines and family dramas has turned my memories into a composite of what 's happened both inside and outside of our house . Four years ago this month , I remember standing in a Long Island field , watching Alice ride as I dialed Bill in South Africa . He was there with Molly , and they were waiting to meet Nelson Mandela but the purpose of my call was to tell Bill his mother had just died . <p> Here 's more : <p> We did go to India this past March , and the Times reporters were released . We celebrated the news with a raucous dinner in Delhi , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the " news " that Molly had food poisoning . She missed seeing the Taj Mahal , as she was too i 'll but she did become Twitter buddies with India correspondent Lydia Polgreen . <p> Which would you rather ? <p> I suppose Vanity Fair readers might be the sort to be interested in the family life and personal musings of Bill Keller and his wife , as well as the type of readership for whom someone like Keller is something of a celebrity , his personal life being as newsworthy as his professional choices . <p> I 'm not a Vanity Fair reader so while I understand , somewhat , the interest , I find Gilbey Keller 's piece indicative of something that troubles me about those in media , even though , by covering it , I 'm a part of the problem . The angst ! <p> The fact is that Gilbey Keller 's piece , while interesting and moving , sure , is n't just one wife 's look at her husband 's work and its impact on their family . It 's a piece @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is now also known . <p> While it is pleasant and satisfying and sometimes even educational to be able to glimpse into the lives of others especially people who have the opportunity to travel to exotic locales where their children can contract food poisoning someplace other than the Muncie , Indiana Best Western that 's not all that 's playing out in this particular article . The article also acts as a move that , whether calculated or not , serves to bolster the idea that those in the media , like Bill Keller , are included in our nation 's ever expanding definition of celebrity . That way , when they churn out articles about , say , how they think Twitter renders a person stupid or when they cast judgment on other news sources or even when they seek to malign this nation 's most beloved past-time the rabid consumption of kitten videos they do so from a position of knowledge and authority . And while I 'd be somewhat keen on learning about Keller 's take on , say , running a paper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his personal musings about a social network tool he , apparently , refuses to use to its full newsgathering potential . That is , I 'm not interested in such an article beyond how it 1 ) reflects on his ( and it was , indeed , " his " ) paper 's reporting and 2 ) acts as an ironic and most likely highly calculated means of giving his New York Times column even more attention across social media platforms . <p> While my fellow Mediaite editors and I cover ( and , for the most part , relish in covering ) the fallout from the media industry 's and political sphere 's most bloated egos , it rings hollow to attempt to fashion an editor of a paper devoted to presenting " all the news that 's fit to print " as a personality in his own right with his family and his oddly personal attacks on fellow media figures also playing a part in his celebrity . <p> I do n't necessarily want to know Bill Keller 's , nor new executive editor Jill Abramson 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paper 's coverage , nor in the journalism of its individual reporters . And I do n't care much to hear either wax on about their thoughts regarding social media , particularly since I should be able to tell this from the manner in which their paper and web properties utilize or fail to utilize outlets like Twitter . I want the product to speak for itself , regardless of the person behind it . <p> Still , it would be cool to be able to tell people that my daughter happened to be Twitter buds with India correspondent Lydia Polgreen . <p> Of course , now that Keller can write op-ed pieces freely without carrying the weight and reputation of the paper on his shoulders , I 'll be more open to his musings . While probably vehemently disagreeing with his take on most things related to the changing ways we consume and share media .@@4165228 <p> The murder case

 's upcoming film Page One : Inside The New York Times ( opening June 17th in New York , and nationally July 1 ) documents a year in the life of the Gray Lady , but also sets the table for what may either be the print media 's suffocation within , or emergence from , the chrysalis of the brave new media world . Rossi spoke with Mediaite about his film , its de facto star ( Times Media reporter David Carr ) , and what it all means for journalism . For the average viewer , Page One is an engrossing look inside the machinery of the news , but it is a must-see for anyone with more than a passing interest in the state of journalism . The film focuses on TheTimes ' Media Desk , particularly on David Carr and Brian Stelter . They are fitting proxies for the audience , as they 're each outsiders , of a sort . <p> Carr is the nucleus around which the film gathers , and his musings form much of the narration . While a 25-year veteran , much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his backstory reads more like a pulp novel than the resume of a media reporter for the world 's most prestigious newspaper . His emergence from drug addiction and crime give him a hard , weathered edge . <p> I asked Rossi how hard it was to resist making world-weary Carr the star of the film . " Initially that was my intention , it was to focus on David , " Rossi says . Carr resisted that idea , he says , " but ultimately , you know , I think he rises to the level of sort of being the star of the film . He is the Virgil , sort of guiding us through all of these stories in a broader sense like , you know , the audience 's potential feeling of alienation or dislocation in a digitizing world .

That 's probably why outsiders like Carr do n't often work their way up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why Carr is such a one-of-a-kind . He braces sources in a way that let 's them know they need him more than he needs them . <p> Stelter , on the other hand , came to The Times fresh from college , after founding TV Newser . Such a rapid rise lends Stelter an outsider 's perspective of a different sort , the young , new media Turk to Carr 's deeply-etched cynic . <p> One of the film 's great pleasures is watching Carr 's complete ownership of new media types . He smacks down a conference room full of online entrepreneurs who try to feed him some PR pap , and deals Newser 's Michael Wolff a coup de grace during a debate on the merits of mainstream journalism with nothing more than a printout of Newser 's front page , and a pair of scissors . <p> In between Carr and Stelter , though , are scores of lifelong Times employees who are being laid off , evidence that they 're waging a losing battle against a media culture increasingly obsessed with profitable , popular fluff , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ villains of the film . In one particularly evocative clip , Arianna Huffington compares those concerned with the cost-cutting and de-professionalization of journalism to prehistoric stone-tablet etchers , declaring that journalism " has always been a technology business . " <p> Rossi takes exception with that attitude . " I think it 's utterly insulting , " he says . " She almost says that people who are bemoaning the erosion of financial stability of newspapers , it 's like , who cares . There 's a lot of smart people saying that this is a digital evolution , the road to some utopian future are going to have a lot of dead bodies on the side of the road . " <p> " That sounds very hardcore and forward reaching , " he continues , " but that does n't take into account a lot of original data and information that those ostensible , potential dead bodies are producing .

" Rossi says . <p> The future is uncertain , but Rossi sees some hope in the results , so far , from the paper 's implementation of a paywall . " I know that about 150,000 people thus far have opted in , " Rossi says , " but I also know that the users for the website is typically about 40 million a month , and I think that that has gone down to about 36 million . And that statistic is pretty heartening , an attrition rate of just for the paywall , when there were predictions that traffic would be cut in half or more .

" Fahrenheit 911 was amazing and incredibly entertaining and really important . I agree , it 's really different from the way that I try to make films that are more observational and less with an agenda . It seems like when Michael Moore sets out to make a film , we almost have a problem set that he wants to find the proofs for . The whole movie is on a trajectory towards proving a point . I think that this film , I think there are a lot of imperatives or messages , but I do n't think that it 's out to prove a point . I think it does prove certain things , but it 's not crafted to do so . " <p> Perhaps indicative of the future that his film tries to lay out , Rossi gets his news from a hybrid of the old and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ newspaper versions of the NY Times and the NY Post , I get them delivered to my door . And I check twitter multiple times a day . Twitter has become , I think , the real fountain of news stories .

" <p> The New York Times is far from perfect ( as the film illustrates by detailing some of its darker hours like the Jayson Blair scandal and Judith Miller 's pre-Iraq War reporting ) , but it 's a bellwether for the health of newspaper journalism , and journalism as a whole .

Herzog , known for , among other things , eating his own shoe and trying to firebomb an actor 's house , provided Colbert with one of the most bizarre and unmanageable interviews in the history of the Report , calling cave paintings " beyond than Baywatch " and philosophizing about radioactive albino crocodiles . <p> Herzog was on the program to promote Cave of Forgotten Dreams , a documentary about the oldest paintings known to man , found in a cave in France .

 World 's Population Disabled : Where Is The Media ? <p> I spent a lot of time reading through Sarah Palin 's pretty much completely uninteresting emails last week . Yes , there were some amusing moments , but overall , they proved that she was running a functional government , the emails of which do n't make for particularly spicy reading . One thing that stood out to me was the email she wrote before the birth of her son Trig . <p> It 's not very often that you see anyone discussing the issues Palin does in that email . As some background , she chose to write an email , with God as the author 's voice , to tell her friends and family that she was having a child with Down syndrome . This passage essentially summarizes the overall theme : <p> Trig 's mom and dad do n't want people to focus on the baby 's extra chromosome . They 're human , so they have n't known how to explain this to people who are so caring and are interested in this new little Alaskan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ joy of this gift I 'm giving to the Palin family , and the greater Alaska family . Many people wo n't understand ... and I understand that . Some will think Trig should not be allowed to be born because they fear a Downs child wo n't be considered " perfect " in your world . <p> In some ways , the email is touching . It paints Palin as a caring and generous mother , and helps to she 'd light on issues that arise when a parent finds out that their child may be disabled . Her book , " Going Rogue " expands upon the themes she touches upon in the email , and the way that she broaches the subject is commendable . For someone as strongly pro-life as Palin is to admit to having hesitancy about having a Down Syndrome child is a courageous move . <p> Did I have enough love and compassion in me to do this ? Do n't you have to be wired a little differently to be gifted with the ability to raise a special needs child , a child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? I did n't know if I should be ashamed of myself for even thinking these things . <p> In reading Palin 's opinions on her child and special needs children in general , it struck me that these are n't things that we hear about very often , or really at all , in the media . Yet , of the world 's population is disabled . Where are the stories about these people ? <p> The only stories we hear about in the media are shocking and sensationalist . For example , this man recently made news for forcing a mentally disabled woman into prostitution . Stories of violence and mistreatment of the handicapped are what are making the news . Are they completely horrible ? Absolutely . They turn my stomach every time I see them . But they do n't directly address the bigger issues that the handicapped are facing in America , which essentially boil down to a lack of federal funding . <p> Many insurance companies exclude certain disabilities from coverage because they expect that the state will pick up the costs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the disabled , the families of the disabled have to pick up the tab . Health care without insurance is not cheap and generally speaking , those who are handicapped suffer from more health problems than the average person . <p> Along similar lines , the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act , ( IDEA ) which was passed in 1990 mandates schooling and therapy from birth through age 21 for all children with disabilities . While this was passed in reaction to earlier laws that kept disabled children out of public schools , and was a huge step for those with handicaps , it still is n't enough . Although the IDEA has an annual budget of billion dollars , this only covers of the costs of educating those with special needs . So the laws mandate schooling , but do n't offer enough funds to run successful programs . As a result , State run programs have to cut corners , and ca n't offer the same level of support that private organizations can . Private organizations are often , you guessed it , expensive . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disabled are facing . In addition , there are obvious stigmas attached to being handicapped ; physical limitations , medical problems and a host of other issues . But perhaps the biggest issue the disabled are facing is that they lack a voice . The media is n't covering their stories in the way that they should . There are not nearly enough advocates for the handicapped . <p> Which brings us back to Sarah Palin . In some ways her openness about her son Trig is wonderful . When I interviewed Mediaite 's Tommy Christopher , he pointed out that " there are very few representations of disabled people as people " . Palin is helping to change that with Trig . <p> But then there is the matter of her political approach to the issues of disabilities . Palin is pro-life , and holds firmly to her principles . But her decision to have Trig , even with prior knowledge of his Down syndrome puts her in a minority : research from the Children 's Hospital in Boston has shown that of women who receive the news @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terminate the pregnancy . <p> Palin 's views on these issues are important , as she appears poised on the edge of the 2012 GOP race , ready to toss in her hat . Her statements in 2008 that special needs families would have an advocate in the White House were she to be elected are interesting to look at now that she has another potential shot at ending up there . As Tommy pointed out : <p> Simply having a special needs child does n't confer you with automatic disability street-cred , and although she had a good record as governor , her party 's current budget slashing will hit special needs kids disproportionately . <p> Similarly , individuals with Down syndrome only account for a small percentage of those who are disabled . There is a huge spectrum of handicaps that affect Americans . One person ca n't hope to speak for or represent all of them . Not that Palin has tried to do this , but she is one of the most visible public figures who in some way represents the disabled . <p> She should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't just fall on Sarah Palin , despite the media 's eagerness to point the blame finger at her . The disabled wo n't get the support they need until they have multiple voices on their side . The media can help with this : we all need to become more comfortable discussing disabilities . Only then will we gain the capacity to confront the issues and change them . <p> Parents ' directive 
 Town Consisting of Three People Votes to Dissolve <p> The small Minnesota town of Tenney , made up of three people ( the butcher mayor , the baker city clerk , and the candlestick maker city clerk 's sister ) , voted to dissolve their town and merge it with nearby Campbell Township . <p> The Minneapolis Star Tribunereports that the vote was 2-1 in favor of dissolving the town , with City Clerk Oscar Guenther 's sister voting against it . Guenther said he tried attracting more people to the city because " people love the notion of a little town . It 's a quaint idea .

Also Maddow disputed the idea that Palin and Michele Bachmann are direct competitors , arguing we are " past the glass ceiling wherein people have to compete to be the female candidate . " Yet strangely Maddow saved her harshest critique for Christie , someone who claims he is definitely not running for President . <p> Christie made comments that President Obama ca n't accomplish anything because he is preoccupied with being liked by everyone .

 AP published an extensive piece on " John , " the CIA agent they claim to be the single most important person on the mission to find Osama bin Laden . Needless to say , it took little time for someone to attempt to identify the man , and today Gawker published photos from the White House Twitter feed claiming them to be of the man , courtesy of a leak website that traffics in such information . While there is no confirmation as to the man 's identity , someone may have been tossed into al-Qaeda 's cross-hairs today . <p> The photo was discovered by the group Cryptome , who used a hint in the AP article to find the man . According to the article , the CIA analyst was " hidden from view , standing just outside the frame of that now-infamous photograph " of the President and his Cabinet watching the raid unfold . Looking through other photos in that album , they found an individual present in several places the article claims he was , and conclude that this must be the man . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only with the caveat that his identity would be protected : <p> The CIA will not permit him to speak with reporters . But interviews with former and current U.S. intelligence officials reveal a story of quiet persistence and continuity that led to the greatest counterterrorism success in the history of the CIA . Nearly all the officials insisted on anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to reporters or because they did not want their names linked to the bin Laden operation . <p> The photos were then reproduced by Gawker ( they are on the official White House Flickr account , but Gawker made sure to point out the man in question ) with further speculation on whether Cryptome found the right man . Cryptome is a competitor to Wikileaks that has , on occasion , directly challenged the protection that organization did n't give Bradley Manning for leaking secret military files to Julian Assange and company . Any organization that lives on the premise that there is no such thing as necessarily secret information will have no problem trying to out this man , and their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sphere is rather clear . When a group blindly vows to disclose information , there is no possible moral opposition to disclosing information . <p> But Gawker is not a website that traffics in such philosophies the way Cryptome does or , for that matter , Wikileaks . It is difficult to come up with a legitimate reason to out someone who , as far as anyone knows , has done nothing wrong , and may have been the mastermind that caught this century 's most hated mass murderer . Other than pure human curiosity , no benefit arises from knowing who this man is , if it even is him . If the person in the photo is n't " John the CIA agent , " then an entire new set of complications arise . Not to mention the title of the post : " Is This The Guy Who Killed Bin Laden ? " The assumption from the headline is that this man was responsible for physically taking the Bin Laden 's life , though the text of the article clearly states that is not the case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of English could easily get confused and rally allies around the falsehood that the man from the AP article deserves to die for tracking down the martyred hero of many extremists . <p> Putting a face to the man who was instrumental in bringing down the idol of hundreds of potentially suicidal psychopaths bent on killing as many Americans as possible only serves to give Al-Qaeda members a target to shoot at . It provides a graphic for their cave-made YouTube videos that their colleagues can print out and burn in effigy , or try to hunt down . Revealing the identity of this man whether the man in the photo is him or not does nothing but endanger a potential hero ( or even some " random staffer " as Cook points out ) and stir the embers of hatred in an organization stripped to the bone by people like him . <p> Or , as one Gawker commenter so succinctly put it : " If this is the guy who tracked down Bin Laden , I can think of no better way to thank him for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ highly trafficked web site and putting his career , his life , the lives of his loved ones in danger .

 know is true : a little while ago , a private meeting between President Obama and Congressional leaders regarding the budget battle ended . Beyond that , the hearsay is flying fast and loose , as Rep. Eric Politico that the President lectured him on Ronald Reagan , told him " do n't call my bluff , " and " abruptly " left the meeting . Meanwhile , Democratic sources claim the President left when the meeting was over and " lit up " Rep. Cantor so badly " if the public saw , Obama would win in a landslide . " <p> " Eric , do n't call my bluff , " Rep. Cantor claims the President told him , and according to reports from both parties then began to lecture the room on talks , claiming that not even Ronald Reagan would accept the terms Republicans were proposing and that , according to Reuters , " I 've reached my limit . This may bring my presidency own , but I will not yield on this . " He then left the meeting because the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he merely stormed out . Rep. Cantor himself said the President " shoved back and said ' I 'll see you tomorrow , ' and walked out . " For added cattiness , the Politico report notes one Democrat quipping off the record , " Cantor is the last guy who should complain about people abruptly leaving meetings . " <p> CNN 's Jessica Yellin reported on John King USA today that the key issue that ticked the President off was Rep. Cantor proposing " a series of short-term votes for the term extension , " something that had been considered unacceptable in many points during the negotiations . This , Yellin relayed , sent him into a lecture about how inefficient Washington was and why faith in the government was at such a low point . This matches the Politico report , in which one official described the speech as " incredible .

 portion of the Sunday morning news shows is often the most entertaining and illuminating segment of the entire program . Given that the top-of-the show politician guest tries their hardest ( and often succeeds ) at sticking to their talking points and avoiding off-script comments , it 's often left to the roundtable participants to provide an element of unpredictability to the Sunday morning festivities . Of the three shows with weekly roundtable segments , in my opinion , week in and week out there is a clear hierarchy between the shows based on the variety of topics discussed , the diversity of guests and the overall enjoyment of hearing the conversation . <p> With the Nation and of the Union not featuring a regular roundtable panel , that means only the three remaining Sunday shows can be judged and will be awarded medals accordingly . The bronze medal goes to NBC 's Meet the Press , the silver to Fox News Sunday and the gold to ABC'sThis Week . The main thrust here is to compare the vast quality differential between the efforts of This Week and Meet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an informative and interesting discussion , but This Week narrowly edges it out for the gold with unique guests and a frequently more laid-back atmosphere that allows for a little more fun banter between the panelists . <p> " Fun " is one word however that would never come to mind of viewers of the Meet the Press roundtable . David Gregory regularly leads a discussion with the same NBC regulars like Andrea Mitchell , Chuck Todd , Eugene Robinson or esteemed newspaper columnists for an " intellectual " deliberation of the events in the week that was . There are subtle differences that often make Gregory 's roundtable sleep-inducing , including the apparently well-known rule that Gregory 's guests rarely engage one another , instead making their case directly to Gregory , and the probably intentional decision to avoid overly partisan guests in favor of centrists and reporters who can participate in more peaceful discussions . The problem however is then viewers are forced to hear frequent guest historian Doris Kearns Goodwin continually talk about how great a president Teddy Roosevelt was , or hear idealistic centrists ( today @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ford Jr. ) complain about how partisanship is ruining Washington and preventing anything from getting accomplished . <p> Several months ago I Amanpour was the wrong choice for This Week , primarily because she made the roundtable a more serious and boring segment than what it had been under her predecessor Jake Tapper . Today however , Amanpour has come a long way , and with her bookers , producers and This Week regular panelist George Will , deserves much credit as it seems she has not only metaphorically let her hair down to enjoy these segments more , but her show now often features more than just one roundtable per show amassing varied experts for different debates . Such a decision often results , as it did today , in exciting and buzz-worthy news ( see here and here ) . Meanwhile the Meet the Press panelists long for the days of yesterday when the opposing political parties were n't so mean to each other and possibly when Meet the Press was the show regularly making the headlines . <h> Parks in New

 n't exactly an area we cover a lot here on the site but readers coming here mostly for politics should be interested in the one big crossover , talking points . Just like politicians ( " kicking the can , " " taking the nation hostage " ) , anyone who follows the soul-sucking world of press junkets and talk show appearances can see actors repeating the same tired , studio-approved messages over and over again . In the case of this movie , the message just seems weird . To paraphrase , someone appears to have instructed Bateman and Reynolds to let the world know , " Yeah , this movie is just as dumb as it looks but it 's also really , really gross ! " <p> I first noticed it during Bateman 's recent appearance on The Daily Show in which he informed Jon Stewart that , sure , body switch movies are old and boring , but this one was R-rated so that was different . It seemed , in Bateman 's skilled hands , to genuinely be an actor going off script to promote a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his admissions were refreshing . <p> Then , however , the studio released this viral video , and it became clear that this " off-script " conversation was as scripted as anything in the movie : <p> Now , for all I know , the movie really does transcend its plot ( and , hell , I 've always kind of enjoyed body switch movies ) , but that video really puts me off . Watching the two gifted actors having to pretend to " rebel " while clearly saying exactly what the studio wrote down for them is just painful . It 's " faux edginess with a clear agenda " reminds me of the immortal " No Adults Allowed " sketch from Mr. Show . <p> Still , while the marketing puts me off , I do find it pretty fascinating . Can anyone think of another movie that 's attempted to diss itself to sell it ? <p> Every summer , 
 nature of politics in this decade , it takes a certain amount of fearlessness to publicly switch teams or even admit to a past reawakening . While certainly not alone in doing so , former Carter campaign staffer Rep. Michele Bachmann and former conservative gubernatorial candidate Arianna Huffington present a striking contrast in how to let the base down easy with news that you are or may have been playing on the wrong team . Simply put , it 's a lot easier to do when switch parties does n't necessarily mean switching beliefs systems and yes , one is possible without the other . <p> Huffington has faced fierce criticism for her conversion to left-wing politics that Rep. Bachmann , while certainly fending off a barrage of criticism of her own , never had to deal with . Much of this , of course , has to do with the fact that Rep. Bachmann switched teams very early on in life , and aside from some work for the Carter campaign in college , while Huffington experienced this conversion very late in life , and at a very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when a market had opened for liberal dissent and vocal calls for big government . But it also have to do with the nature of the change in ideology and the climate in which it happened . <p> That Huffington was once a conservative before metamorphosing into the liberal web proprietor we know today is no secret ; she had lent prior support for Newt Gingrich and professed belief in small government . Here 's how a Salon column from 2003 described her evolution : <p> Of course , Huffington 's current political incarnation anti-SUV polemicist , diarist of corporate greed is an unlikely development for a woman who came to American political prominence as the wife of oil magnate Michael Huffington ... She was widely viewed as the brains behind his campaign , and when it failed , she went on to work with House Speaker Newt Gingrich . Then she began a slow , surprising evolution leftward talking up the rumors of Warren Beatty 's presidential run , championing the candidacy of Republican insurgent John McCain , hosting the distinctly activist Shadow Conventions during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and finally , organizing the Detroit Project , which raised money and produced the controversial anti-SUV ads . <p> As the proprietor of the Huffington Post and author of several political tomes , it is difficult to recall her as anything but what she is today , but for those who saw her rise as a right-wing talking head , her current reinvention is difficult to reconcile . Take , for instance , an interview she did with Judge Andrew Napolitano on Freedom Watch , where the libertarian host asked point blank of her new position , " How can anyone take you seriously ? " <p> Rep. Bachmann , in contrast , seems to take her days as a college liberal are mostly taken in jest , as she told a Michigan Republican gathering this year . " I 'm a Minnesotan who had ' DFL ' that 's what we call Democrats in our state stamped on my birth certificate , " she noted . This only changed when she read Gore Vidal 's Burr , when " as a reasonable , decent , fair-minded person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' You know what ? What he 's writing about , this mocking of people that I revere , and the country that I love ? ' " Unlike Huffington , one can see vestiges of the present Rep. Bachmann in her description of what she was like as a " liberal . " <p> What 's more , those on the right that condemn Huffington do n't do so simply because she abandoned their cause , but because she did so after having established herself with it . Experiencing a political conversion later in life and doing so in the political spotlight is nearly unforgivable in this highly polarized , futuristic world of 24/7 cable news and internet a world , ironically , that Huffington had a great hand in constructing . It is not too different a phenomenon from what cost former **28;54;TOOLONG Senator Arlen Specter his seat in Congress . There is a point of no return in a public career from which one simply can not survive as a respected political figure . <p> In Bachmann 's case , the switch was neither public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notes above that she was a Democrat by default . It is telling that she was a Democrat under Ford given the insidious nature of the Watergate scandal , it would be wiser to distrust of the few remaining Republicans in the Ford era than of those looking for an alternative to seemingly endless corruption . And then there 's the eureka moment she thanks Gore Vidal for providing her . Nothing we know about Rep. Bachmann today would be incongruous with the idea that a book mocking the Founding Fathers would be offensive enough to her to prompt a political conversion . <p> For Huffington , it was the inconsistency of her beliefs that drove her to switch . She has admitted in interviews that her conversion was prompted by an increased trust in government . " I actually believed that the private sector would be able to address a lot of the issues that I believed were very important , " she told John Stossel in a 2008 interview . As much as Rep. Bachmann rails against the far-left extremism she sees in the Obama administration , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Democrat who shared her beliefs on the size of government , because those have n't changed . <p> The templates to follow for such conversions vary greatly , depending on the time and place in which each were enlightened , but to take the two at face value and claim that Huffington gets much more flak for having come from the right is to ignore a large set of factors that contributed to the lighthearted nature of young liberal Michele Bachmann turning into one of the more beloved and feared conservatives figures of our time and made the reverse phenomenon in Huffington far more controversial . <p> Update : A Huffington Post spokesman sent us the following statement : <p> I 'm emailing you to correct inaccuracies in your story . Arianna Huffington did not for Governor of California as a conservative . She ran as an Independent . Furthermore , you claim that is was the " inconsistency of her beliefs " that caused her to change her politics . The truth is less dramatic : she has always been progressive on social issues pro-choice , pro-gun control @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Republican . However , whereas she once believed the private sector would address America 's social problems , she realized first-hand that that was n't going to happen without government action . <h> The Tisch :

 class has n't quite finished talking about Newsweek 's " intense " cover photo of Rep. Michele Bachmann , but it 's already safe to say the UK Telegraph has found a way to grossly outdo it . In a scathing look at the Iowa State Fair that makes it sound part Rome during Lupercalia , part French Revolution mobbery , the Telegraph decided to run a somewhat blurry photo of Rep. Bachmann , mid blink , chomping on a corn dog . <p> The photo actually goes quite well with the article , which sounds like it was written by a high-class 17th century English fop who the Telegraph forced into a time machine and sent to Iowa because none of their actual reporters would reduce themselves to the indignity of on-the-ground coverage at a crass American " state fair , " whatever that is . Author Toby Harnden turns his nose up at everything from fried twinkies ( understandable ) to Tim Pawlenty 's cowboy boots ( really ? ) . This is the opening : <p> On the eve of the Ames Straw Poll , the Republican candidates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fair in Des Moines a huge spectacle in which cattle , pigs and horses are on display as well as politicians and Iowans queue to for fairground rides and some of the most unhealthy food on the planet ( I was going to try the Fried Twinkies but the queue was , alas , too long ) . <p> Tom Harnden does n't stand on lines . Alas , he " queues . " <p> But the maddening arrogance of the text will almost certainly get lost behind the photo one that would work well in a slightly trashy campaign ad but is obviously not fit for print . As what reads like a hasty attempt to justify using it , Harnden ends the piece by noting that Bachmann drove away on a golf cart with her husband , buying the corn dog and " after applying mustard and allowing Mr. Bachmann to take the first bite , she chomped into it with gusto . " This is highly salient to the piece , apparently , as a cultural note : in America , presidential candidates eat " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( the correct word is " unhealthiest , " by the way ) and drive golf carts and have husbands who get first dibs on whatever disgusting thing the lady 's having . Oh , those Americans so quaint ! <p> But it 's not hard to see how her supporters and even some of her detractors can begin to see a deliberate attempt to undermine the one characteristic Rep. Bachmann has that no one seems to disagree with : she 's photogenic . There are photos of all the Presidential candidates that are equally unflattering , because , as has been explained many times by many critics , photographers often take a rapid series of photos to get the best shot . It 's difficult to believe that professional photographers are this bad , or that Rep. Bachmann is simply difficult to photograph in the wild . <p> Then there 's the sexist subtext here : would the Telegraph have run a similar photo of a presidential candidate consuming an obvious phallic symbol if said candidate were male ? Phallic symbols make for good comedy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and there appears to be no intent at humor here , only degradation . The image sends a clear message to any woman thinking about pursuing such high public office : we at the Telegraph are unable to look at you as anything but a sex object , no matter what your qualifications for office . That 's not to say the decision to public such a photo is always innately sexist some outlets clearly would have run the photo no matter who was in it , particularly on the internet ( looking at you , Wonkette ) . Whether a print publication a British one with no theoretical reason to work for or against any American candidate would have is an entirely different question , one that we can expect to get addressed often among conservative commentators in the near future .@@4273337 <p> SALEM A 
 books are banned in schools or libraries in the United States , the phrase " concerned parent " is bound to pop up at one point . All the usual suspects get the same run-through ; Huckleberry Finn , The Catcher in the Rye , and more recently , Slaughterhouse Five . A few days ago , a concerned parent in Virginia raised concerns over the depiction of Mormons in the Sherlock Holmes book A Study In Scarlet , and it was consequently taken off class reading lists . <p> The book will still be available to older students , but it was removed from the 6th-grade reading list because one parent found a paragraph in the book that he believed was insulting and denigrating to Mormons , and young children should not be introduced to the religion through the book . This is the paragraph in question : <p> ( John Ferrier ) had always determined , deep down in his resolute heart , that nothing would ever induce him to allow his daughter to wed a Mormon . Such marriage he regarded as no marriage at all , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think of the Mormon doctrines , upon that one point he was inflexible . He had to seal his mouth on the subject , however , for to express an unorthodox opinion was a dangerous matter in those days in the Land of the Saints . <p> Wait , that 's it ? Is that really the evil anti-Mormon message being sent by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle ? The Obama campaign using " weird " as code for " Mormon " is , I would think , slightly more offensive to Mormons than a paragraph in a book no one has even heard of anyway . <p> But the bigger issue at hand here is the idea of censorship , particularly censorship at the grade school level . Every time parents say they are doing this " for the children , " that 's really code for " our kids do n't get to be exposed to things we do n't like . " As mentioned above , Slaughterhouse Five was recently banned in a Missouri school district because some parents complained about the anti-Biblical message of the book . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Huck Finn or changed all the references to the n-word to " slave .

In response to Slaughterhouse being banned , the Kurt Vonnegut Memorial Library has offered to give out over 100 copies of the book for free . The library 's executive director had this to say about the book ban : <p> " It is shocking and unfortunate that those young adults and citizens would not be considered mature enough to handle the important topics raised by Kurt Vonnegut ...

A lot of us blamed weak " conservadems " for undercutting stronger measures , but as President of the United States , Barack Obama should have been able to heel those blue dogs . <p> There was also a lot of impatience with the President on the repeal of Do n't Ask , Do n't Tell , but history has shown that his handling of that issue was pitch-perfect . <p> Now that the House has gone Lipton , and the Senate is no longer filibuster-proof , there 's a tendency in this town for people to be like the Oliver Platt character in 2012 , whose every utterance is a way too-harsh reality .

Instead , they got the Bad . From Crooks and Liars : <p> No , liberals are n't upset that he does n't make more heartwarming speeches . Liberals are upset that Obama 's tactics to negotiate in the conditions Zakaria describes is to start out giving the other side more than of what they want and move further to the right from there . But that 's a much harder position to defend , so Chait and Zakaria create a strawman to make liberals look unreasonable .

 to enter a feminism feud between Sarah Palin and Gloria Steinem with low expectation 's for the latter 's thoughts , if only given the extra three decades Steinem has studying the subject and being at the vanguard of the feminist movement . And yet , on Fox News today with Megyn Kelly , Palin tore the feminist mantle out from under Steinem , somewhat disgruntled that the latter had made sex an issue and dismissing her claim Palin was bad for women as a relic of another era . <p> Palin was on with Kelly to discuss the National Organization for Women 's rebuke of Newsweek for running an unflattering photo of Rep. Michele Bachmann , which the group called " sexist . " While Palin was happy to see that NOW had defended Rep. Bachmann despite her beliefs , she could n't agree that the photo was sexist , and in fact seemed pleased that Rep. Bachmann was getting a bit of a Nixonian treatment from the media . " Bottom line , " she told Kelly , " every candidate is going to be vetted . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be vetted the same way as a man , or moreso , as sexist I do n't  know if I 'd characterize it as sexist , " Palin admitted , " I just characterize it as being the new normal in a way it 's quite healthy . " Palin not only went as far as to call the cover , by proxy , " healthy , " but take a bit of a veiled swipe at Rep. Bachmann , insisting that in the 2012 elections , such vetting will be necessary to find someone who , among other traits , had the " executive experience " to govern . <p> Kelly then brought up criticisms from feminist icon Gloria Steinem , who argued that Palin and Bachmann had " sold out the women 's movement " and made their careers on being women " only a man could love . " Palin , unfazed , argued that Steinem seemed to have missed the train on 21st century feminism which , without either the previous statements semi-supporting the Newsweek cover or her subsequent explanation , would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Palin actually backed up her claims with some substance , as a career woman who had risen to international recognition against the odds herself . " I think Gloria Steinem has evidently had her day ... it 's over , it 's very passe , " she said of her comments . As women who " desire to serve something greater than self , " ( and in this she recruited Kelly herself ) , " we are the women 's movement ; we are illustrating equality . " Palin gave her predecessor credit for " adding some healthy debate back in the day , " but concluded that her opinion nowadays was moot , as " she does not share our views of women being able to do much more than she gives us credit for . " <p> At face value , it 's hard to disagree with Palin 's statement : that it 's " healthy " to see candidates vetted equally , and any evaluation of their efficacy as political icons that stems exclusively from an acknowledgment that their genitalia is the minority in politics , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A woman running for office , one imagines , would much rather be lauded and smeared on their statements and political merits as harshly as any man would , and given what we 're seeing with Rick Perry , Rep. Bachmann would have an uphill battle arguing she 's getting it worse than anyone else . That 's not to say that Newsweek 's cover is or is not sexist , or that **25;117;TOOLONG smears like the Telegraph 's now-famous Bachmann corn dog photo do n't prove that not everyone has tossed gender tropes out of their political quivers . But the shift must begin with a demand from people like Palin not to be victimized , and as far as her comments here , she is doing just that . Palin even has a good argument that comparisons with Rep. Bachmann , who despite defying the 50/50 odds and being female , is an entirely different political breed , are now perfunctory are as sexist as any attack against either . <p> Palin goes out of her way to say vetting in 2012 requires finding a candidate with " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ political voice with little need to learn to compromise or inform herself on what her peers fellow governors are thinking . Rep. Bachmann , with her attorney degree in the bag and experience in Congress , is extremely unyielding within the context of her job description , but legislating necessarily requires a different way of thinking . What 's more , even in the way the two women publicly muse on their randomly selected status as females they differ more than they agree . Palin went out of her way to defend Byron York 's question to Rep. Bachmann about her wifely submissiveness while in Iowa , adding that she could " never imagine my husband telling me what to do " ( Marcus Bachmann famously commanded his wife to study tax law , a subject she claimed to hate ) . They may be conservative and have brown hair , but nothing in the way their publicly discuss their wifely duties seems to align in a way that would permit Steinem to generalize in such a way . <p> The validity of attacks on Palin 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the women 's movement , only unnecessarily obscured in a way that functions to Palin 's benefit . By highlighting some sort of abstract " women only a man could love " appeal , Steinem takes away from the plethora of entirely valid criticisms that give even many Republican pause about Palin from her short time in an executive position to how fast and loose she seems to be with her understanding of complex issues , and Palin capitalized on that quite effectively here . <h> Missouri River Governors

 James Hoffa , Fails To Inquire About ' Sons Of Bitches ' Comment <p> When the news hit this morning that Teamsters Union head Jimmy called the Tea Party " sons of bitches " at a Labor Day event attended by the President , Americans responded with one powerful , unavoidable question : " When did they find Jimmy Hoffa ? " After being informed that the apparent anachronism was merely due to the fact that Hoffa 's son , James , Jr. , had taken the Teamsters throne , it was time to demand an answer for the tactless rhetoric . That demand fell by the wayside in his next TV appearance , however , as CNN host John King asked him only to elaborate on the labor movement 's zeitgeist and their take on the 2012 contenders . <p> Hoffa appeared on John King USA to discuss the labor movement and the Tea Party 's place in it after his speech today from which the controversial clip was played to introduce the guest . But that was where any discussion of the rhetoric ended , and instead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether Hoffa was satisfied with the more fiery tone exhibited today . He was , and he explained that , to him , " there really is no dealing with the Tea Party you ca n't be reasonable with people that are unreasonable .

" I think people are aware now that this group is after them , " he contended , via their opposition to significant funding for entitlement programs . <p> King asked him specifically about one political candidate in the Republican race whose roots were , long ago , in the Detroit auto industry . Hoffa seemed to be in disbelief with some of Mitt Romney 's rhetoric , arguing that he was " making a mistake " to attack unions given the current progress in the city , which Hoffa believed significant . " I ca n't believe that he 's talking this way and I do n't know who he 's addressing , " Hoffa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to work in Michigan . " Hoffa did not address his remarks this morning , nor was he prompted to . Hoffa did give an interview earlier today to Talking Points Memo , however , where he said he would say the exact same words again , word for word . <p> For many other guests who say and do outrageous things all the time and get media coverage for them , it may have been perfectly reasonable to overlook the comments , which made for one of the top stories of the day . But for Hoffa , calling the Tea Party " sons of bitches " is just about the entirety of the 15 minutes to which he , as we all are , entitled . Hoffa is not and has not been an important figure in the national news spotlight for a very long time leaders like Andy Stern and Richard Trumpka greatly overshadow his influence in the labor movement . The only thing that would make Hoffa an interesting person to talk to about such issues for anyone watching is the fact that he made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the United States that has yet to be explained . While a simple question about the comments would have been in order , he was instead allowed to make the same point in much more lukewarm terms that the Tea Party was " unreasonable " and dangerous to the labor movement without question . <p> That is not to say that King had to be belligerent at Hoffa for the comment , as many on the right will surely demand of him in the future . Some on the left have denied that Hoffa meant anything of it other than voting people out of office , suggesting Fox News selectively edited the comments to make them sound violent ( Fox News aired the comments earlier today , and the clip used on John King USA is the same one that appeared on Fox News ) . Other sites have published more extensive quotes from the day that show he was at some point during the speech referring to elections , and Fox News aired a longer clip of his full comments with context later in the day . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needlessly antagonistic but , as it stands , Hoffa remains unaccountable for what , if taken at face value , are significantly off-color comments and , more importantly , his only claim to relevance .@@4306818 <h> Search Results <h>

Speaking about the Republicans ' lack of a formal response to tonight 's presidential address , Beckel reminisced about Jindal 's 2009 post-SOTU response , saying , " It reminded me of a call center ad from Mumbai . " About three weeks ago , Beckel channeled his inner Al Swearengen when he tried to dig his way out of a " redneck " comment by explaining that " Chinamen " can be rednecks , too . At the time , he confirmed what many conservatives think when he said , " I 'm a liberal , I can get away with this stuff . " <p> There may be some truth to what Beckel said .

It was ... feisty ! There were certainly some strong opinions on the issue , and multiple viewpoints on the best way to acknowledge and address it . While the ideal , of course , is to have awesome women talking onstage about anything other than this topic , it did start a conversation , about which many people disagreed but few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presenting who would otherwise not have attended . Fundamentally , it changed the ratio and was a factor in changing the ratio in a multitude of real , specific ways going forward . For that , feisty though it was , I really ca n't thank Michael Arrington and Sarah Lacy enough . <p> SARAH : First of all , some people on this panel would have you believe that we need to raise awareness that there is not enough women in tech . So , I just want to get this done really quickly . Can we get a show of hands in the audience : anyone who is shocked that there 's more men than women working in tech ? Anyone who is shocked at the news that there 's more men in leadership positions than women ? All right , one guy in the back . Ok , I suggest you look around the room . Ok , you 're not shocked anymore . Now that it 's not an awareness problem that there 's more men in tech than women , let 's talk about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raise awareness . <p> As Eric alluded to this is n't a panel I thought we should have . I do n't like women being tokens on stage . I have an issue with it and that 's what 's going on here . Mike asked me to do it . Essentially we 're here because you Rachel Sklar think TechCrunch is holding down women . That 's what started all this . <p> RACHEL : Oh , come now . That 's not what I said . There was an article in the Wall Street Journal about the dearth of leadership positions for women in the tech community . And I started an initiative called Change The Ratio , which addresses the ratio that you just pointed out and is very visible here . <p> Before we get into this I actually think it 's important to say that I actually think that this is a great panel , I 'm psyched to be on it . I 'm psyched to see all these people on it who might not have been added to other panels . I appreciate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needle is now being moved . The ratio is being changed because you because Michael Arrington made the decision to see the issue and make it happen . So , my quote in the Wall Street Journal was I wanted to raise awareness so that people would see an event like TechCrunch Disrupt and not be able to not notice the overwhelming maleness of the line-up . I mean , if we 're getting into it , it 's really hard to find conferences , panels , magazine articles , where women have even close to gender parity . We 're not talking about 50/50 , 60/40 , 70/30 <p> SARAH : I 'm not disagreeing with you . As I said , and the audience obviously agrees , this is n't news to everyone . We can pick up a magazine , we can see this . I 've been a reporter for 15 years . I mean , I know I 've written more men in business than women in business . We try every year to get as many women on a panel as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <h> article <h> Vintage 
 , it does n't look like American Idol will ever die . Even if we come to a point where Fox needs to develop cloning techniques just so there will still be new , innoffensive singers to compete , as long as people keep watching , then Randy Jackson will continue telling those clones that they are , in fact , da bomb , dawg . That 's just the way capitalism works . Success and money means immortality .

Take a look at how the audiences are watching this program , and you 'll find that amid unthinking laughter people have been corrupted .

Do n't they realize that creating products that poison and corrupt young people is the best way to be successful ? <p> So , next time you 're sitting at home , listening to another bland white guy with a guitar absolutely butcher a Rolling Stones song , and wondering why the heck you 're still watching this show , just remember that you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clip of Super Girl .

 Jane Harman called Maher out over the remark , prompting him to resort to the familiar , idiotic defense that it 'd be sexist for him not to insult Kelly . <p> You do n't have to be a stand-up comic to recognize that Maher 's insult was scripted to look like an ad-lib . " The blonde twink asking the questions , " he said , pausing for audience reaction ( even though there was none ) , then said , " I 'm sorry , Madame Curie ... " <p> He went on to criticize Kelly 's framing of a question about public support for taxing millionaires , repeatedly underscoring the fact that he supposedly did n't even know Megyn Kelly 's name . <p> Former Democratic Congresswoman Jane Harman , currently the head of the Woodrow Wilson Center , waited for Maher to finish his question , before calling him out . Referencing Maher 's earlier interview with Confidence Men author Ron Suskind , Harman coolly observed , " About the ' blonde female ? ' We just had Ron Suskind on ... whose book was about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As Harman tried to point out that she was the only woman on that night 's Real Time episode , and that she 's also a blonde , Maher interrupted to say , " It 's not because she 's a woman , it 's because she 's dumb . " <p> Maher offered the weak defense that nobody ever called him sexist for insulting George W. Bush ( because Bush does n't belong to a group that 's been historically dismissed for their gender , genius ) , then added , " It 's actually more sexist to call attention to somebody when I say ... I did n't say she 's dumb because she 's a woman . " <p> Later in the segment , panelist Michael Moore got to the heart of the matter when Maher referenced Kelly again , sarcastically , as " that esteemed woman , " to which Moore interjected , " whom you 're secretly attracted to ...

She 's just another hot Fox News babe with an empty head . The sexism is self-evident , since it would be damn near impossible to make the judgment Maher does without ever learning the person 's name . <p> Maher 's comment is wrong on several levels . First of all , there are legitimate reasons to criticize Megyn Kelly , but five minutes of watching her on TV demonstrates that her remarkable good looks are far outstripped by her toughness and intelligence . There 's a running joke in media circles about Fox News and vacuous on-air eye-candy ( although it 's a phenomenon with deep roots throughout TV news ) , but Megyn Kelly in no way fits that bill . She famously left a nearly decade-long career as an attorney to become a journalist , a courageous move that deserves respect , even from her critics . <p> But even if she did fit that bill , even if she was simply plucked from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maher 's remark would have been no less sexist . It is legitimate to criticize someone 's qualifications , and even to make the case that their looks are the only thing they 've got going for them , but you 've got to make that case , and if you peg it to their gender , while not even learning their name , you 're guilty of sexism . <p> This is an issue that has particular resonance for me , because I 've seen how this double-standard cuts both ways . In addition to having impeccable journalistic chops , many of my female colleagues also have to be world-class beauties in order to succeed alongside male journalists who , no offense , meet a much lower bar of physical attractiveness . After passing every test , overcoming every obstacle , these women then have to struggle to be taken seriously by people like Bill Maher . His piggish attitude demonstrates that , whatever short-term leg up female journalists gain by being attractive eventually erodes on the actual field of play . <p> Update : As an amusing sidenote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but in the kind of move his site routinely calls out mainstream outlets for , introduces Jane Harman simply as " former Congresswoman Jane Harman , " omitting the fact that she was a Democrat . Only waaay way at the end of Sheppard 's commentary ( although Harman is identified as D-California in the transcript ) does he give any indication of Harman 's point of view , saying " Brava to Harman for calling him on it . If only more left of center women would . " <p> C'm on , Noel , you can say it : Harman is a liberal , and you 're right , she deserves credit for calling Maher out .@@4340050 <p> LEWISTON , Maine

 March Has A Woman Problem <p> I went in to The Ides of March wanting to like it . I really wanted to ! It has West Wing-esque political drama , following a candidate and his campaign for the Democratic nomination for President . It boasts a stellar cast including George Clooney and ( feminist ! ) Ryan Gosling . It has already garnered significant Oscar buzz and is seen as a potential Best Picture contender . But five minutes in , it became glaringly obvious that even the combined star power of Clooney and Gosling could n't save this film from its major problem : the women . <p> In a cast full of all-star talent , there are two women in this movie and both characters are vapid , one-dimensional , and function only to prop up the male characters . As the film opens , the first female character ( Evan Rachel Wood ) is bringing coffee to a team entirely of men she 's an intern . From what I can see in the film she is the only woman working on the entire campaign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Later it is revealed ( spoiler alert ! ) that she has slept with multiple men on the campaign staff and repeatedly calls herself a slut . Altogether , her character in Ides exists for two reasons : 1 ) to sleep with the men and 2 ) to bring coffee for the men . <p> The other female character is a reporter played by Marisa Tomei who hounds Ryan Gosling and Philip Seymour Hoffman for scoops . Her character gets probably no more than 15 minutes of screen time and is more an archetype than a complex character . She functions largely as a pawn in the male characters ' twisted schemes and betrayals , with no real storyline of her own . This is the role given to Marisa Tomei , an actress who has won an Oscar and been nominated three times . It 's a terrific waste of talent to relegate her to a role of such little significance . <p> Towards the end of the movie , suddenly , we 're introduced to another woman . Maybe there 's hope , I thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new intern , still fetching coffee for the men . <p> Tomei and Wood are both talented actresses and both give strong performances even within the vast limitations of the roles they are handed . But I left the theater with the persistent nagging feeling that the women in this movie are so one-dimensional they 're one step away from being props . Much like The Social Network , this is another critically praised film where women are portrayed as ballbusters , sluts , coffee-fetchers , or helpless damsels whose men cheat on them ( that 's Clooney 's character 's wife , who appears on screen only a minute and barely speaks ) . In the world according to The Ides of March , it is men who make all decisions , men who run for office , men who work on and run campaigns politics is still entirely a man 's world and the women are just messing it up for them . <p> And while American politics is still largely dominated by men it has come a long way in the last several years , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to believe . There have been dozens of prominent women running for office and even more working on campaigns in the last few election cycles : there have been Hillary Clinton , Nancy Pelosi , Sarah Palin , and countless others . Patti Solis Doyle ran the Clinton campaign in 2007 and Donna Brazile ran the Gore campaign in 2000 , to name just a couple . Yet nowhere in do the writers even consider the possibility that women may have had something worthwhile to contribute to politics . <p> Someone suggested to me that perhaps the absence of any meaningful female characters in Ides was deliberate meant to be a reflection of the current reality of our political system and a nuanced commentary on the low numbers of women in American politics today . Oh , I wish Hollywood were that progressive ! But women are regularly marginalized on screen , and Ides is not the first film to do so nor will it be the last . <p> The Bechdel test for women in movies tests whether women have a meaningful presence in a film by looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two women <p> Who talk to each other <p> About something other than a man <p> Seems so simple , but in The Ides of March , Tomei and Wood never cross paths both are on screen so briefly and they never speak to each other at all . <p> Flip that around and ask yourself , not just about Ides but any movie : are there at least two men ? Are they talking to each other ? About something other than a woman ? <h> Profile : The

" In the beginning , we recommended a dialogue between the two sides and all parties , but they did not pay attention to our recommendations .

" <p> " But we sympathize with all people of the world , " Amadinejad continued . " We say , ' Why Afghans should be killed ? Why American soldiers should lose their lives ? Why they should spend so much money for killing people instead of using the money for development ? ' That is very simple . Maybe the U.S. administration does not accept that . But believe me , continuation of these policies are going to lead to the collapse of the U.S. empire . And it is against the interests of the people of the United States . " <h> " Do n't

 conservative undercover journalist James O'Keefe released the second installment of his " To Catch A Journalist " series , a takeoff on Dateline NBC 's " To Catch a Predator " sting aimed at discrediting mainstream journalists . His first swing , at Sam Stein , missed badly , and his second attempt , aimed at NYU Prof. Jay Rosen and Clay Shirky , brings the count to 2 and 0 . Prof. Rosen , however , responded to O'Keefe 's attack with some revealing information about O'Keefe 's " investigation . " The second " To Catch A Journalist " video , released yesterday , features hidden-cam clips of a classroom discussion by NYU journalism professor Jay Rosen and new media expert Clay Shirky , and although it contains lots of buzzy right-wing watchwords ( like " The New York Times , " or " elites " ) , even out of context , the cumulative effect is of a fairly ordinary classroom discussion . It 's like an upskirt photo of someone in snowpants : <p> The video is so baffling , I emailed O'Keefe yesterday to find out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shirky doing . He did n't respond to that question , but from the video , it appears that he thinks the " We are the " bite is the money quote . ( I also pointed out that he had published Prof. Rosen 's phone number in the video , and it 's still there today . Nice . ) Rosen explains the context of that quote : <p> When Shirky says " we are the most elite ... " and I follow it up with " we 're the one percent ! " the discussion was about news consumption : journalism professors and students are at the extreme end in attention to news and willingness to pay for it . But you can feel O'Keefe salivating over those words as he splices them in . The implication he wants : we are your overlords ! <p> In his response last night , Professor Rosen echoed that criticism , saying " there 's not much to say because it 's so incoherent , context-less and , frankly , boring . As Erik Wemple of the Washington Postput @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in not-so-fascinating ways about media and politics . ' " <p> What Rosen does reveal , though , is that when O'Keefe called him to get comments on some quotes from the class , Rosen was able to discern who taped the class : a prospective student , pseudonymously dubbed " Lucas , " who was a guest in the class that day . As always , it turns out the devil is in the details that did n't make it into O'Keefe 's video : <p> " Lucas " had taped us , surreptitiously . Then he asked to meet with me . I did n't know it at the time , but this was part of the sting . He said he wanted to become a political journalist : did I have any advice ? I gave him several career paths he could follow . He asked me if being a politics major and a journalism minor would be a handicap . I said no . Then he let me in on something . <p> He said he had a tape of a Tea Party gathering in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things were said . He said it was gruesome stuff . He wanted to know how he could get it to the media . To the New York Times . I said the New York Times would n't be interested in something like that , and that he might try to contact Max Blumenthal of the Nation . He asked if I had any other advice for him . I said find a niche and start a blog . I gave him the examples of Ezra Klein , Dave Weigel and Nate Silver to show him that it was possible . I was trying to inspire him ! " Lucas " thanked me and left . He had a strange smile on his face . <p> It 's understandable that O'Keefe would want to justify the he spent on a hidden cam , and the time invested by his operative , but not only is this product embarrassing , it also manages to undercut O'Keefe 's credibility even more than it already has been . In the second part of our interview , O'Keefe defended a similar omission , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he probably would have gotten more play if he had made " Lib Journo Prof Does The Honest Thing " his lede . <p> I asked O'Keefe if he planned on releasing the footage of Prof. Rosen 's meeting with the Project Veritas operative , and why he had n't done so . His response was mystifying : <p> Please follow up with Jay Rosen about the contested info regarding Clay Shirky and The New York Times . Jay Rosen , my trusted source , did n't comment there . <p> I would talk to Professor Jay Rosen , my trusted source , to make sure he 's comfortable with the New York Times 's characterization of Shirky 's relationship with the NYT . <p> Not to get into the weeds , but in the video , O'Keefe identifies Shirky as someone who " has done consulting work for The New York Times , " which Shirky and the paper dispute .

 the sort of dad who would console his teenage daughter 's boyfriend when he crushes the boy 's father in an election . This the most recent development from a fascinating profile in New Yorker of the Republican candidate 's daughters particularly Liddy Huntsman , the one with Saturday Night Live aspirations and the tension within the Huntsman campaign about their comedic recklessness . <p> The profile , by Ryan Lizza , has some hilarious anecdotes about the sisters in it , which lead the story . One , in particular , reveals that at least one of the Huntsman girls has been a repeated problem for his political career , though one he has always been able to temper : <p> When Huntsman was running for governor of Utah , in 2004 , Liddy , then sixteen , began seeing the son of his Democratic opponent . The night before the election , Huntsman found his daughter at her computer engaged in a tearful instant-messaging chat with the boy , Briggs Matheson . " My dad was , like , ' What is going on ? ' " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You ca n't win , Dad . Briggs says his life is over if you win . ' " Huntsman sat down at his daughter 's computer and , pretending to be her , consoled the distraught boy over I.M. ( The next day , he crushed Briggs 's father at the polls . ) <p> The article also indicates that there is some tension between former campaign staff and the Huntsmans , whose Twitter account is run without much of any oversight by the campaign , as are their videos , like their parody of Herman Cain 's " Smoking " ad . The girls seem to feel the campaign does n't understand their sense of humor . " We are the only ones providing some honest humor in this race , " said Abby Huntsman , while Liddy Huntsman the one who tweeted a " Panda Express " foreign policy joke at Mitt Romney seemed entirely dismissive of the concern . <p> Another confession ? Seeing someone like Romney towering over Huntsman in the polls is " humbling to them " that being the candidate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whatever he can to be President , and everyone knows that , " Abby Huntsman told Lizza , disappointed that this seemed not to deter his campaign . <h> The Global Entertainment 
 almost like an Onion parody of the Herman Cain alleged sexual harassment story , The New York Times ' Caucus blog reported , Sunday night , that a woman has come forward to accuse Cain rival Mitt Romney of being polite but disinterested in her health care reform suggestions during a recent Delta Airlines flight . Following a week in which disastrous PR only made his rival stronger , Mitt Romney is getting bad press for minding his own business on an airplane . I now officially feel sorry for Mitt Romney . <p> According to The Times ' Emmarie Huetteman , Romney ( flying coach , of course ) was polite and gracious to passenger Carolyn McClanahan , and even posed for a picture with her , before things got ugly : <p> According to Ms. McClanahan , about an hour into the flight which Mr. Romney mostly spent reading USA Today and using an iPad while wearing headphones she told him her idea for improving the American health care system : slashing overhead costs by switching to an electronic billing system . <p> " He looked at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then put his iPad headphones in and kept reading , " she said . <p> That was n't the end of Romney 's reign of , though , as McClanahan said the former Massachusetts Gov. responded to another passenger 's request for a Boston restaurant recommendation by saying " I ca n't give you any . You 'll have to ask someone else . " <p> This was obviously a trick question , though , as Romney would 've gotten grief whether he sent that passenger to the nearest Subway , or for a reservation at Chez Monopoly Guy . <p> Now , I kid Romney , but I 've got to give him props for restraint here . If someone interrupted me while I was rereading the latest Twilight book on my iPad , I 'd have been like , " Really ? You thought up an electronic billing system ? Let me show you my idea for a unicycle , but with two wheels ! I call it the ' ! ' " <p> Based on this experience , McClanahan ruefully ( see what I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel he 's out of touch or does n't want to be in touch or that he 's afraid to be in touch . He 's just like people describe him : just very wooden . " <p> As Romney himself has said , there are many reasons not to vote for him , but his politely wanting to be left the eff alone on an airline flight should not be one of them . This story just underscores the self-fulfilling nature of the political media 's " who do you want to have a beer with " narrative on picking presidents . I think most people , upon encountering their president at the local watering hole , would ask , " Why are you having a beer with me ? Do n't you have shit to do ? " <p> Granted , there are lots of people who do cast their votes on the basis of irrelevant things like " relatability , " and it is weirdly fun to watch candidates chase that idea , but should n't the media push back against that , rather than simply reflect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one that kicked off last week , it really becomes a sad joke . Herman Cain started the week evading questions about alleged sexual harassment , then capped off a raft of contradictory TV appearances on the subject by being wildly , raucously cheered by the Republican base , and maintained his already inexplicable grip on the GOP frontrunner 's spot . <p> Romney , on the other hand , is clearly the most qualified candidate in the field , but no matter what he does , the Republican townspeople always seem to want a different sheriff . The whole thing is beginning to remind me of the story of poor Frank Grimes , from what was probably The Simpsons ' most darkly comic episode ever . <p> Grimes was a hard-working , competent hard luck case who found himself in a rivalry with Homer Simpson , and no matter how badly Homer screwed up , or how hard-working and competent Grimes was , people still loved Homer , and hated Grimes . He ends up dead , his tombstone engraved with the nickname that he despised , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ critique of the utter failure of substance in our culture , as it invites viewers to love Homer , and loathe Grimey , in complete defiance of the merits .

And they landed on what was probably the most unlikely of formats a five-person panel show that tackles the day 's topics from several angles . It 's like The View , but for political junkies . And with more suspenders . <p> On Monday , Entertainment Weekly 's Editor-at-Large , Ken Tucker , ushered the show into the realm of pop culture relevance by responding to the show 's take-down of his South Park criticism . Yes , it was a response to a reaction to a review , and therefore borders on being too " inside baseball " for most people . But Tucker generally dabbles in network comedies and established hits , rarely going up the dial into the cable news shows . He loves The Five , though , calling the show , " my favorite guilty pleasure . " He then adds a level of weirdness in describing the hosts , implying that Greg Gutfeld is toady and suggesting that Kimberly Guilfoyle is , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ break with clockwork regularity , to keep young boys just home from after-school sports watching closely . " It 's a little odd to think that many 16 year-old boys rush home from basketball practice to flip on FNC , even if it 's for the occasional shot of Guilfoyle 's legs . If this was 1980 and the internet was n't so omnipresent ? Perhaps . But it 's still a strange assessment of Guilfoyle , a former deputy district attorney in Los Angeles . <p> Regardless , as creepy as Tucker is in his descriptions , he somewhat nails the attraction of The Five , which wins its 5 p.m. time slot in the 25-54 demo with regularity , and by a wide margin . It 's a loose , funny , smart group of people . And Beckel regardless of what comes out of his mouth looks like he should be filmed in black-and-white with an ashtray of still-smoking cigarettes in front of him . " Unlike so much of what we see on squawky news talk shows , The Five five enjoy each other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happy family , you know ? " tucker writes .

 The Brave New World Map Of URL Shorteners <p> When the revolution in Libya began , many Americans , savvy to the ways of international diplomacy , raised an important point : what would happen to bit.ly ? The . ly in bit.ly , after all , is the top-level domain ( TLD ) reflecting the country code for Libya . The country controls the TLD ( though not all access to the domain ) ; any . ly domain that 's purchased is money going to Libya . <p> It 's not as though bit.ly sought the domain to express support for the country , of course . Its TLD happens to also be a suffix for a number of English adverbs . Like the nation of Tuvalu which several years ago saw a boom in purchases of its . tv extension , Libya is one of the happy nations whose country code is in demand by English-speakers . These nations ( with country codes like . me , . to and . in ) also benefitted from the rise of Twitter . When you 've only got 140 characters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makes a difference . <p> The result is a diverse multinational array of shortened URLs allowing media companies , businesses , even political candidates the opportunity to reinvent their identities .

 ago when The Greatest Campaign Ad Ever Made by Man or God ? was unleashed upon the world by Herman Cain , every single blogger worth his weight in snark ( including this one ) made the note that it looked like something dreamed up by surrealist comedians Tim and Eric . Well , as coincidence would have it , one half of that duo , Tim Heidecker , was becoming oddly fixated on Cain and the strange ( or evil ) comedic possibilities he held . How fixated was Heidecker ? Well , he 's now released a full album of songs dedicated to the man . <p> Heidecker , who already had a musical career going in addition to his comedy , clearly felt a kinship with his fellow musical multi-hyphenate Cain .

 's Countdown , host Keith Olbermann gave Rep. Allen West ( R-FL ) top honors in his " Worst Persons " segment , ostensibly for " admitting " ( and even " bragging " ) that he was a member of a white supremacist motorcycle gang , after denying any connection to such a gang for the past year or so . <p> In the weeks before the 2010 mid-term election , NBC News reported that West defended The Outlaws motorcycle club in an email to a supporter , and that he was photographed at an event speaking to other clubs affiliated with The Outlaws . <p> At the time , West 's campaign manager , Josh Grodin , issued a statement saying the report as a " political hatchet job by the liberal mainstream media ... Let me be perfectly clear , Allen West has absolutely no ties to the outlaw bikers club an organization with a history of criminal activity , as well as racism against African Americans . " <p> On his program last night , Keith Olbermann mangled even the basic background of the story , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liar " West " had once been a member of an otherwise all-white motorcycle gang . " <p> Perhaps Olbermann can be forgiven this slip , though , since it was West himself who appears to have originated that oversell when he told an interviewer , " " This most recent desperate insidious attack where Lisa Myers of NBC News did her piece where they are trying to associate me as a member of the Outlaw motorcycle club ... " ( emphasis mine ) . <p> But then , Olbermann makes the bewildering claim that " now , when it 's useful for a compulsive liar like Allen West to admit that he was in that gang because he can use the ' yes ' answer to play the race card . " <p> Notwithstanding the mysterious premise ( how would boasting about membership in the Outlaws help West ? ) , the clip that Olbermann plays , from the conservative Scott Show , is obviously not an " admission " of past membership in the Outlaws , but rather , West citing an example of what he believes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cain must endure . Here 's what West said in the clip that Olbermann says consists of a " boast " that West was the " only member of a white supremacist biker gang " : <p> Scott Hennen : Is it an attack on a black conservative because he 's a black conservative ? <p> Congressman West : " Oh come on , I mean you know I was the only black member of a white supremacist motorcycle gang , so liberals and there are certain others I would say even within our party that are not comfortable with strong black conservative voices , and I would say there are people that feel very threatened by that because we do stand on principle . We are someone or entities that are out of the mainstream , if you want to call it that , so liberals are definitely going to come at you . But I think you also have this inner fight within our primary candidates for that piece of the pie that they want to have . " <p> Olbermann was n't the only one to report @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he misinterpreted the clip , but it 's hard to imagine something so obvious getting past everyone on his show . <p> Ironically , West 's supporters now have to choose whether to spread West 's lie that NBC accused him of being a member of the Outlaws , or call him out for it , or simply give Olbermann a pass .

 odd bit of journalistic protocol for you . Yesterday we brought you the story of the allegedly shoddy and even violent treatment that a number of journalists received at the hands of the NYPD when they attempted to cover the eviction of the Occupy Wall Street protesters . In that story , we mentioned how many of the journalists resorted to using Twitter to disseminate information about the apparent " media blackout . " This was especially true when a number of journalists were actually arrested for attempting to do their jobs . However , an Associated Press reporter and photographer have gotten in a little trouble with their employer for Tweeting about their arrest . Not because they were arrested but because the AP could have totally broken that . <p> The story comes from the Daily Intel which was forwarded a company-wide email sent to AP staff . The email reminds the staff that " we 've had a breakdown in staff sticking to policies around social media and everyone needs to get with their folks now to tell them to knock it off . " <p> The guidelines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . However , many see them as outdated . Would it not have been easier for the Associated Press to simply have retweeted the reporter 's tweets ? After all , they may have scooped the wire , but anyone else on the scene ( and there were plenty or journalists there ) could have scooped it too . Still , this kind of practice may go against the very business model of the AP . <p> The opinion of most journalists , though , probably fall in line with that of the New York Times ' Brian Stelter , one of the reporters live tweeting the raid last night . In response to the Daily Intel 's piece , Stelter wrote that , if the staff is getting in trouble for beating the wire , " should n't the wire speed up ? !

Joel McHale , one of the stars of the show , explains that at the beginning of the episode , the college 's glee club shows up in the cafeteria and annoys everyone with their singing , so his character , Jeff Winger , calls ASCAP and tells them that the club is using copyrighted music without the permission of the artists .

 , in the world of ratings , how many different conclusions can be drawn from the same set of numbers . Someone can be winning a nightly battle in " total viewers , " but lose in the 25-54 year-old demo . An anchor may be up a certain percentage from a year ago , but be down compared to the previous month . There are so many opportunities for twisted language and clever turns of phrases that when networks come out with their year-end ratings press releases , there 's room enough for everyone to just say wonderful things about their own shows , and not have to bring up those on rival networks . <p> But MSNBC 's release , sent out this week , had a little bullet point that seemed out-of-step with the rest of the information ( " A25-54 " is the estimated number of viewers in the demo ; " P2+ " is the estimated number of total viewers , all numbers courtesy of Nielsen ) : <p> " Hardball with Chris Matthews " at 7 p.m. ranked #2 with A25-54 ( 188,000 vs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CNN 's 537,000 ) . This is " Hardball 's " best A25-54 delivery since 2009 . CNN 's " Erin Burnett Outfront " is performing below what " John King USA " did in the hour with Adults 25-54 . " <p> The Erin Burnett mention pits her show against another on her own network , as opposed to solely contrasting it against MSNBC 's Hardball . Furthermore , the numbers MSNBC used for comparison are not the same as the ones CNN used . <p> MSNBC looked at John King 's numbers at 7 p.m. from the start of the year to Sept. 30 , 2011 . It then compared them to Burnett 's numbers from Oct. 3 , 2011 ( OutFront 's debut ) , until Dec. 15 , 2011 . <p> In CNN 's release , they compare Burnett 's numbers from Oct. 3 , 2011 , to Dec. 15 , 2011 , with John King 's numbers in the same time period last year . Their data finds Burnett to be up in total viewers and in the demo . <p> In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the same year , while CNN measured her against the same predecessor in the same time period a year before . And , after comparing the two , it ends up with CNN holding the advantage in methodology . There were plenty of huge events taking place in the first nine months of the year that drew viewers to all the cable news networks ( the Arab Spring , bin Laden 's assassination , among others ) , and there 's no way of knowing what Burnett 's numbers would have been had she been the anchor , instead of King , for those events . More likely than not , OutFront would have gotten a boost , possibly up to King 's levels , from viewers tuning in to ( as cliched as it sounds ) watch history unfold . <p> Even holding her 2011 ratings against the 2010 numbers are somewhat unfair , as the Chilean miner drama was unfolding in October 2010 , and resulted in ratings boosts across the board . But using that time frame is really the best and only window @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ viewers , and even in the demo , is an impressive feat . <p> In baseball ( just stay with me for a moment ) , there are groups of numbers known as " splits . " They are , basically , statistics split into different categories . A hitter 's splits , for example , could include his batting average in the month of September . They can be represented in almost any category : home runs in day games , runs scored on turf in April , ERA in June on the road . The specificity of the splits can sometimes be maddening , but they can be used both to make a player look good or bad . And this , I think , is where MSNBC got tripped up . <p> MSNBC is looking at one set of Burnett 's splits , while CNN is looking at another . What wins out , however , is the relevance of the splits one looks at , as well as what lies beneath the numbers . While MSNBC could be looking at something like Burnett 's " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months of the same season , they 're brushing off the fact that she ( figuratively ) had a sore elbow for one game and was facing the Yankees twice , while he faced the Mets and Dodgers without DHs in their lineups . King would , obviously , have better numbers in that scenario . Not to take away from King 's ratings , but Burnett did n't have the luxury of an Arab Spring to report on . She had a handful of debates and Halloween . <p> CNN , on the other hand , is looking at a more appropriate predictive statistical measure , like Burnett and King 's WHIPs against the same team ( say , the Orioles ) . <p> In short , MSNBC may be ignoring some extenuating circumstances in stating that Burnett is down against King . It is the truth , of course , and they are n't making numbers up , but their methodology may be hiding some significant elements buried beneath the numbers . CNN 's comparison looking at the same time periods in essentially ( or as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a more accurate measure of Burnett 's ratings compared to King 's . <p> Both networks , however , are ignoring another baseball statistical term : small sample size . No matter how good or bad Burnett looks right now , she 's been on CNN 's air for under 90 days . Any good statistician knows that she needs at least a few more months in the majors before we can make any kind of real judgment .@@4476506 <p> General Electric Co. 
 Ron Paul 's ( R-TX ) ascent to the top of the polls in Iowa comes the obligatory media glare . Although not as flashy as the newsletter controversy , here 's a fascinating curio from Dr. Paul 's political closet : in a Christmastime appearance on Meet The Press in 2007 , Paul said that Abraham Lincoln should never have started the Civil War , instead ending slavery by having the federal government purchase all of the slaves and set them free . Like many libertarian ideas , it 's appealing unless you think about it for five seconds . <p> Set aside the question of , if Ron Paul disagreed with starting the Civil War , why he did n't just tell Lincoln himself . This is serious business . <p> The late , great Tim Russert asked Paul about remarks he made to The Washington Post . " I was intrigued by your comments about Abe Lincoln . ' According to Paul , Abe Lincoln should never have gone to war ; there were better ways of getting rid of slavery . ' " <p> " Absolutely , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a senseless civil war . No , he should n't have gone to war . He did this just to enhance and get rid of the original intent of the republic . I mean , it was that iron fist ... " <p> " We 'd still have slavery , " Russert interjected . <p> " Oh , come on , " Paul replied , dismissively . " Slavery was phased out in every other country of the world . And the way I 'm advising that it should have been done is do like the British empire did . You buy the slaves and release them . How much would that cost compared to killing 600,000 Americans and where the hatred lingered for 100 years ? Every other major country in the world got rid of slavery without a civil war . I mean , that does n't sound too radical to me . That sounds like a pretty reasonable approach . " <p> Sure , it 's reasonable if you 're one of the people doing the buying , selling , and " phasing out . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a payroll tax cut extension that benefits 160 million people . How long does Ron Paul think it would have taken to muster the political will to fund a slaveowner bailout that only benefited people who could n't even vote ? The British bailout plan that Paul refers to freed 40,000 slaves , at a cost of ? 20 million , of the government 's total annual expenditure . There were almost four million slaves in the US when the Civil War began . <p> As for that newsletter controversy , Ron Paul has consistently expressed regret over what he says was a mistake , and in the years I 've been covering him , nothing I 've seen or heard from him would lead me to believe that the ideas in those newsletters reflect his beliefs . Having said that , part of making up for a regrettable mistake is facing the music for as long as it plays . If people still have questions about it , Paul owes them answers , just as surely as he is owed the chance to give those answers . <h> Is Nyquil a 
 as with any time an old star comes back to host , Saturday Night Live looked to its past . They recreated acouple of host Jimmy Fallon 's classic sketches and , since the season was right , they even brought back Horatio Sanz , Tracy Morgan , and Chris Kattan to perform " I Wish It Was Christmas Today , " the holiday hit they first did back in 2000 . The goofy tune is actually one of the few Christmas songs not written 50 years ago to have had much staying power so its unsurprising that Fallon and Sanz have performed it a number of times in the past decade . We 've collected all the different versions below . <p> The first version , from December of 2000 , is the simplest and sets the ridiculous tone perfectly ( Why 's Tracy Morgan there ? Why not ? ) . <p> One year later , the quartet reunited to play the song again . Listen to how loudly the audience roars when it becomes clear what song is actually being played . Also , look at Fallon 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2009 , the year Fallon began to host Late Night . The show has become famous for its musical performances as well as its callbacks to the host 's SNL past so it should n't have been any surprise that Sanz would stop by to perform the song . However , things got even better a verse in when Julian Casablancas joined in to rock things up . <p> Casablancas actually released a single version of the song that year . It 's pretty great . <p> And then , finally , we get to this past Saturday when the original four got back together . Horatio Sanz is skinny , Jimmy Fallon has a good haircut , and Christmas was good again . <p> Fun stuff . <p> However , to wrap things up , here 's a bonus SNL Christmas treat . As great as " I Wish It Was Christmas Today " is , it might not be the best recent holiday tune the show has done . In the humble opinion of this writer , that title would befall 2005 's " Christmas for the Jews @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ song is a pitch perfect parody of Phil Spector classics and its even sung by Darlene Love ( who , of course , already has one Christmas classic under her belt ) .

 Al Gore In 2000 : ' For The Love Of God , Stop ! ' <p> Friday 's year-end review episode of Current TV 's The Young Turks was a veritable feast for longtime Young Turks viewers and noobs alike , as host Cenk Uygur gave each of his fellow Young Turks a turn in the spotlight . Among the treats was a piece of video , courtesy of longtime co-host Ben Mankiewicz , in which Cenk commits an act of supreme liberal heresy , and tells future boss Al Goreto stop contesting the 2000 presidential election . He does this in characteristically low-key fashion , imploring Gore " For the love of God , stop ! " <p> Longtime TYT viewers have probably already seen many of the vintage clips that were featured on Friday 's episode , but it was great for new fans , and who could ever get tired of watching Cenk Uygur hawk tires for Tire Heaven , wolfing down a bacon cheeseburger , or seeing him get body-checked out of an interview with Kevin Spacey ? Unfortunately , Current does n't yet post entire episodes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 'll have to settle for this brief walk down memory lane , from CurrentTV : <p> Please enable Javascript to watch . <p> With friends like Ben Mankiewicz , who needs enemies ? <p> In a few short weeks , the Current TV iteration of TYT has managed to strike the right balance between its gritty , underground visual style and the right level of production polish . It 's a big change from the web series , which always punched above its weight class in production values , but that signature look is important to conveying the show 's ethos to those who have n't been with Cenk and the gang for years . <p> It was a lack of identity , in my view , that severely hampered the show that MSNBC threw together for Cenk . They never bothered to give it a name , or a look of its own , and it was missing the most important ingredients to The Young Turks ' success : the rest of the Young Turks . The Current TV show hit the ground running with the entire group @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ audience to get to know Ben , Jayar Jackson , Ana Kasparian , and Dave Koller . The success of the new show rests largely on their work , and chemistry , with Cenk .

 of the opinion coverage Fox News has done on Occupy Wall Street , you could be forgiven for thinking that critiquing the rich is a sin against man . Seriously , I 'm pretty sure the phrase " class warfare " has been said more times on that network in the past few months than " this just in . " But a recent report from the Washington Post and University of Michigan that shows that the median net worth of Congress members has skyrocketed in the past year has raised some FNC producer 's dander ( as well it should . ) The figures are astounding . <p> Political analyst James Kotecki pointed out that it probably was n't that rich people were " gaming the system " to get into Congress . Rather that , with campaign finance reform desperately needed and campaigns so incredibly expensive , we 've now reached a point where it 's basically impossible for anyone aside from the super rich to run for office . <p> Now , I could start bitching that there 's a seeming hypocrisy where , if you complain about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country in a way none of us ever could , you 're mocked on The Five , * but , if you talk about the politicians doing the same thing , Fox News will jump on board .

 his interviews with police following the shooting of Michael Brown , Ferguson officer Darren Wilson described the unarmed as being so " angry " he looked like a " demon . " In this description , MSNBC 's Rachel Maddow saw shades of John DiIulio 's 1995 Weekly , " The Coming of the Super-Predators . " <p> " It was meant to sound scary , and it was , " Maddow said , before quoting a portion of Delulio 's controversial theory later recanted by the author . <p> wrote : <p> On the horizon , therefore , are tens of thousands of severely morally impoverished juvenile super-predators . They are perfectly capable of committing the most heinous acts of physical violence for the most trivial reasons ( for example , a perception of slight disrespect or the accident of being in their path ) . They fear neither the stigma of arrest nor the pain of imprisonment .

So for as long as their youthful energies hold out , they will do what comes " naturally " : murder , rape , rob , assault , burglarize , deal deadly drugs , and get high . <p> As Maddow pointed out , despite the fact that Wilson said he " felt like a five-year-old holding onto Hulk Hogan " in his altercation with Brown , both men were 6 ' 4 ? ( though Brown weighed 290 lbs to Wilson 's 210 ) . <p> " He 's 6 ' 4 ? , armed , a trained police officer , inside a police car , " Maddow said of Wilson . " He thought he had met Hulk Hogan , a larger-than-life threat that he could stop only by shooting .

She 's everywhere on the network because she 's smart , witty , and has actually said several of the " 6 things we wish cable news pundits would learn to say . " You 'll almost never see her trolling or engaging in a shoutfest and yet , unlike the normal cable news trajectory , her punditry is being rewarded with more appearances . Perhaps there is hope after all . <p> Sally Kohn , CNN A diehard progressive , Kohn never shies away from saying what 's on her mind , even if it stirs controversy . By repeatedly drawing the ire of the conservative commentariat , Kohn has substantially boosted her profile over the past year , becoming one of the most-recognizable commentators in CNN 's arsenal . She 's also seemingly everywhere lately interviewing Bill Maher in Variety , writing a column for The Daily Beast , or appearing on CNN 's untitled all-female @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hoover . <p> Kate Bolduan , CNN Kate Bolduan is as relentless an interviewer as exists on television , all the more devastating because she does n't draw attention to herself like some more anchors . Her cornering of Texas Governor Rick Perry on the immigration crisis last summer was a master class in holding a politician to account . Perry did n't seem to know what hit him ; more lawmakers and executives should feel that way following their cable news appearances . Bolduan 's been on maternity leave , fueling ugly rumors of her current gig 's demise . We hope to see her and her distaste for rhetorical slipperiness back in the New Day anchor chair soon , or even on her own show . <p> Richard Grenell , Fox News This former Romney advisor and U.N . ambassador spokesman just renewed his contract with Fox , cementing his position as one of the network 's top-level pundits for the next election cycle .

As we wrote earlier this year , his show , Up , boasts " wonks and reporters " rather than " pundits and bloviators , " a reflection of Kornacki 's own priorities . <p> Drew Griffin , CNN CNN 's long-time investigative reporter really came into the spotlight this year for his relentless uncovering of horror stories in which American military vets wait months for care at VA facilities , sometimes resulting in death . He 's also won a prestigious National Press Foundation award for his series of " Congress for Sale " reports on the dark side of politics and the congressional obsession with fundraising . Following @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Dana Bash , Griffin is making a name for himself by as Anderson Cooper labels it " keeping them honest . " <p> Harris Faulkner , Fox News This long-time reporter and anchor may not be as young as other rising stars on this list and she 's certainly more well-established , having hosted the weekend Fox Report for years but we selected her because of how much her profile has risen in the past year , thanks to a hosting gig on Outnumbered . Along with Sandra Smith ( an honorable mention for this list ) , Faulkner plays an excellent straight-laced anchor to the show 's more ridiculous pundits ( See : Keith Ablow ) .

 his amazing nine-year run on The Colbert Report last night , but with all the excitement over his star-studded finale , let 's not overlook one of the most underrated voices in late night : the Scottish-American cheeky monkey Craig Ferguson . <p> It 's possible many of you may not be intimately familiar with Ferguson or The Late Late Show , so here 's a quick summation : his sidekicks are a talking robot skeleton called Geoff Peterson and the pantomime horse Secretariat , there 's always time for , four dings means we talk like Italian Bill Clinton ( " " ) , and it is always a great day for America . And he had the best damn theme song of any late night show on television . <p> Ferguson 's last show airs tonight on CBS at 12:37 am EST ( though it was taped yesterday ) , and in honor of the occasion , we 've assembled ten of the best and enjoyably weirdest moments from Craig Ferguson 's 10 great years behind the Late Late Show desk : <p> You are seeing this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slideshows you need to enable javascript . There 's no cross domain hackery or tracking voodoo , it 's just some sweet jQuery animations . Please , think of the animations . <p> In the meantime , enjoy the html version below . I guess . If that 's your thing . <p> Okay , I 'm just throwing you in the deep end without a life preserver right now , because this is genuinely one of the weirdest things you 'll ever see from any late night host , especially without context . Before Geoff and Secretariat joined the show , Craig had to grab guests in the cold open all by himself . And so , occasionally he would put on these grand musical spectaculars , including this completely silly and random yodeling session : <p> Sid the cussing rabbit Craig Ferguson 's show aired on CBS , which meant he was constrained by the bounds of network television , but it was on incredibly late at night , thus allowing him to push certain limits . Enter Sid the cussing rabbit , a hand puppet that appeared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place . The combination of the cuteness of the puppet , the innocent little accent Craig gives him , and the liberal use of profanity made this one of the most memorable side characters created on the show : <p> Britney Spears monologue This was the moment that Craig Ferguson established himself as a different kind of late night host . He devoted a whole monologue to explaining that he would n't be making fun of Britney Spears for her personal troubles because he struggled with addiction for many years of his life . He shared some remarkably candid stories about his past and his fight for sobriety in one of the most honest late night moments ever . <p> Remember when Conan O'Brien briefly hosted The Tonight Show ? Well , here 's a fun fact : not even a few weeks into his Tonight Show run , NBC put out a press release calling him the " king of late night . " Craig , who did n't particularly care for the late night wars , had a great cold open mocking this by simply declaring himself the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Awkwardly addressing the Letterman sex scandal Not only did Craig Ferguson follow David Letterman on CBS , but his show was also produced by Letterman 's company Worldwide Pants , making Letterman his boss . So . You can imagine how awkward things got for Craig when Letterman publicly admitted to affairs with female staffers . Most of the humor in this bit comes from Craig 's reluctance to talk about it at all , but he also did have some very poignant things to say about morality in the entertainment industry . <p> Desmond Tutu interview This is the episode that earned Craig Ferguson a Peabody award . The entire thing was devoted to one guest : Archbishop Desmond Tutu . It was a very in-depth interview rivaling the best conducted by more political late night hosts like Jon Stewart . ( Another great interview of his worth highlighting is his audience-free episode featuring Stephen Fry , which you can watch here . ) <p> Becoming an American citizen Back in the early days of The Late Late Show , Craig decided to campaign for American citizenship , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state in the nation on the way to becoming a real citizen . ( And fun fact , Sarah Palin made him an honorary citizen of Alaska back in 2007 . ) And then , he finally became an American citizen , and shared the moving experience with his entire audience in 2008 . <p> Rocky Horror cold open See what I meant about the cold opens ? This Halloween one represents everything that made Craig Ferguson such a fun host . There 's no explanation , there 's no lead-in , just Craig talking with a zombie and then everyone bursting out into song .

Geoff Peterson is a robot skeleton created by former Mythbuster Grant Imahara . Geoff was voiced by another underrated talent : Josh Robert Thompson . Thompson did some very good impressions of celebrities like Morgan Freeman and Liam Neeson ( QUICKLY ! THERE 'S NO TIME ! ! ! ) , and every single disembodied voice on the show ( from Miriam to evil Santa ) is his creation . But a few years ago , Thompson was away from the show for a weeks-long period , so Ferguson decided to bring in celebrities like Lauren Graham and Alfred Molina to supply guest voices for Geoff . And the greatest guest voice had to have been that of none other than Larry King . Now , the reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 ) he had the idea of letting King do this in the first place , 2 ) he has the best banter with King , and 3 ) it features what I believe is the single greatest crack-up in recent late night history .

 Message to Palin Amid Rumors of Trump Endorsement <p> There 's been a bit of friction in some conservative circles today over Sarah Palin 's rumored endorsement of Donald Trump over Ted Cruz .

 and Trump Are Battling For the Soul of Oprah <p> On her show Friday , Maddow reported on Mike Bickle , the extremist Christian pastor who endorsed Cruz . Among Bickle 's more flamboyant beliefs is the notion that Oprah is a harbinger of the End Times . She 's a " classy woman , a cool woman , a charming woman , but has a spirit of deception and she is one of the clear pastors , forerunners to the Harlot movement , " Bickle has said . <p> Conversely , Trump has expressed over the years his fondness for Oprah , semi-seriously floating her name as a potential VP pick . " I like Oprah , " he said in June , " what can I tell you ? She 's great , she 's talented . " He added : " I 'd love to have Oprah . I think we 'd win easily . " <p> And so there you have it . In the clownish cosmology of the GOP primary race , Oprah is either VP material or media Mephistopheles . <p> Maddow concluded : <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Donald Trump/Ted Cruz death match , at this stage in the 2016 presidential race , one of the fronts of battle turns out to be Oprah Winfrey . I mean it 's a pretty clear distinction , right ? Harbinger of the Antichrist or possible running mate ? Choose . <p> In the classic Maddow tradition , this is a goofy hook that helps drive home a couple relevant ( if well-worn ) points . One is that Trump is treating the election like the world 's greatest reality show ( which it may well be ) . The other is that Cruz has been quietly collecting the endorsements of far-right Christian extremists , whose stated convictions form a constellation of harrowing views on women 's rights , marriage equality , and the role of religion in government .

 California 's Assembly Bill 60 allowed undocumented immigrants to pursue driver 's licenses beginning on January 2 of 2015 .

That 's of the licenses that were issued in California last year . <p> According to The Orange County Register , the state hired 1000 temporary employees , extended Department of Motor Vehicles buildings ' business hours , and opened new locations where immigrants could file for a license . It was just enough to accommodate the portion of the 2.4 million undocumented immigrants that sought licenses . <p> " We were surprised , but no unprepared , " said spokesman for the DMV , Artemio Armenta . <p> Although they were prepared for the onslaught of applicants , the process required to obtain a license slowed down considerably .

" <p> Lawmakers and pundits have to be careful about condemning the program too much , though . Historically , that has n't always worked well , considering the amount of positive feedback the programs receive from the immigrants and their family members . For the affected immigrants , however , there are very few complaints .

The total cost of the three-year program implementation is estimated at million . Many have mixed feelings like Moore , especially because advocates of the law have pointed out that not only do undocumented immigrants benefit from the inclusion , but everyone on the road is safer when all the drivers around them are licensed . <h> National underutilization of

 ' My Mother is Very Deeply a Person of Faith ' <p> Over at The Post 's Page Six , Richard Johnson is doing the Lord 's work .

It is deeply authentic and real for my mother , and it guides so much of her moral compass , but also her life 's work .

Whitlock explains that he 's having King on to discuss his Peyton Manning article , not to continue their Twitter feud <p> The fourth time , Whitlock let 's King finish his opening statement : " You do have a demonstrated history of bullying and sexism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Buker that he shamed and abused her for being a woman . He argues that this makes Whitlock incapable on viewing the sexual harassment allegations against Manning through an unbiased lens . <p> ( 16:48 ) After Whitlock continually denigrates King 's journalistic chops , King points out that Whitlock once tried to recruit him , even inviting him to his office for a one-on-one interview . <p> Whitlock immediately shoots him down , saying he only interviewed him and never offered him a job . " I thank God daily I did not take that job , " King shoots back . <p> ( 17:52 ) Whitlock tells King that the reason he did n't hire him is because he looked into stories he posted and decided they were probably fabricated . " We tried to vet out the amazing stories you told , and we could not vet those stories , " he says . <p> In particular , Whitlock says King wrote a story claiming when he was 14 , the rapper C-Bo came to a restaurant in Kentucky and got in a shootout .

" <p> ( 29:50 ) King accuses Whitlock of sexism again , noting that in his entire tenure at ESPN , not a single woman wrote for him . Whitlock counters that he hired women as editors , which King notes is a tacit admission that he never published a story written by a woman . King again points to the incident when Whitlock fired his female assistant for " speaking out of turn , " which even ESPN admitted violated policy . <p> ( 31:10 ) King and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Whitlock drops all pretense , and straight-up calls King a white dude .

Hodges , the two landmark cases for marriage equality . <p> Scalia also joined the majority 8-1 opinion that ruled in favor of the WBC in Snyder v.

 Donald Trump Fits Right In On Game of Thrones <p> HBO 's Game of Thrones is littered with themes of political strife , tension among nations , and the pursuit of power at all costs .

We have a tremendous problem and we ca n't be the stupid country any more , " Trump says in a recycled soundbite on his plan to ban Muslims . <p> The rest of the video shows Trump in his element : blasting his critics , boasting about all the support he has , and , of course , fortifying the Wall against the White Walkers .@@7421488 <h> Grieving loss of 
 Cruz Campaign Caught Pushing Fake Smear of Rubio <p> According to an article pushed by the Ted Cruz campaign Sunday , Marco Rubio casually renounced his Christianity in a roomful of people yesterday . <p> In a video posted by the University of Pennsylvania student paper The Daily Pennsylvanian , Rubio runs into Ted 's father Rafael Cruz and a Cruz staffer while the campaigns were both staying in the same hotel . According to the video 's subtitles , they had the following conversation : <p> After The Daily Pennsylvanian posted a trolly piece wondering what book it was , the Cruz campaign of course responded by telling them it was the Bible . <p> Now if the video 's transcription is accurate , Rubio randomly went up a Cruz staffer , complimented the Bible ( " Got a good book , there " was a statement , not a question ) , immediately denounced it seconds later in full view of a room of people and his young son , and then casually strolled off . That may strike some as plausible , but only those who are already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problem is , listening to the audio , Rubio does n't say " not many answers in it . " It sounds to me like he 's saying " all of the answers " are in it . Some say they hear him saying " a lot of answers in it , " but it definitely does n't sound like " not . " <p> According to Rubio spokesman Alex Conant , his boss said " all " of the answers . " How do I know ? I 'm in the video ! ! " he tweeted . <p> People hear what they 're told to hear and what they want to hear . Here 's the same video with the subtitles of what the Rubio camp claims he actually said .

Before that , the Cruz campaign pushed untrue rumors that Ben Carson was dropping out of the presidential race during the Iowa caucus , and sent out official-looking mailers telling Iowans they had committed a " voter violation " that could only be rectified by voting for Cruz . <p> I 'd say Cruz campaign should be ashamed , but really they ought to be proud .

 grade Fox News receives for its impeccable preparation and performance for last night 's GOP Debate from Detroit , which was the most-watched debate of 2016 ( an estimated 17 million viewers tuned in ) . The primary takeaway : After nine months and literally hundreds of interviews by Donald Trump with every kind of outlet , Fox 's debate team finally found a way to nail the GOP frontrunner on his lack of specific detail : Full Screens ... TV jargon for graphics . And in pushing the GOP frontrunner into a corner he could n't spin out of , all while immediately peppering him with more full screens in anticipation of what his answer would be upon presenting the first full screen , it provides a perfect microcosm of the aforementioned prep . <p> And that includes Pell grants for low-income students and aid to states for special education . I assume you would n't cut those things . The entire budget for the EPA , the Environmental Protection Agency , billion . <p> TRUMP : OK . <p> WALLACE : The deficit this year is billion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Your numbers do n't add up , sir . <p> Moments later , in a move right out of a chess match ( planning two moves ahead ) Wallace went the Full Screen route again when Trump claimed savings that could be achieved by negotiating better prices on prescription drugs would help fill the gap : <p> TRUMP : You are talking about hundreds of billions of dollars ... <p> WALLACE : No , you are not . <p> TRUMP : ... if we went out to the proper bid . Of course you are . <p> WALLACE : No , you 're not , sir . Let 's put up full-screen number two . You say that Medicare could save billion a year negotiating lower drug prices . But Medicare total only spends billion a year on drugs . Sir , that 's the facts . <p> KELLY : " Mr. Trump , one of the things people love about you is they believe you tell it like it is . Time and time again in this campaign , you 've actually told the voters one thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

Bush lied leading up to the 2003 Iraq War again , tangible , easy-to-absorb stuff that did n't allow Trump to deny he ever said such things . " How is any of this telling it like it is ? " she proceeded to ask , adding , " You change your tune on so many things , and that has some people saying , what is his core ? " <p> Trump responded by agreeing " You 're right " and then stated a need to be flexible on certain positions in order to get things done . Will that answer be good enough those loyal to him in his corner ? We 'll see . Answer : Probably ... if the recent past is any indication . <p> The reaction across the Twittersphere was almost universal in its praise for Fox 's approach and execution last night , most notably from those who normally deride the network as being on/to the GOP : <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has n't appeared on any program on the network . And the fact that Bernie Sanders who is n't scared of anything and stands by the courage of his convictions will be appearing solo on Monday ... speaks wonders about Clinton , who probably saw what Wallace , Kelly and Baier did to Trump on his changing positions last night while questioning his core values and vowed never to expose herself to that kind of scrutiny . Because in the end , as someone who lacks a core herself , she 'll look no better than Trump appeared last night . <p> As for the rest of the candidates , John Kasich ( A+ ) was the clear winner . Again , the only adult in the room , on policy and perspective , and has a better record and more experience than anyone on either side of the ledger .

Honorable mention : Howard Stern ( A ) got four times as many mentions as Bernie Sanders . Note : Never doubt his title , King of All Media ever again ... <p> As for Trump ( D ) , he easily had his worst night and failed a big test I stated he had to pass earlier that day : Could he pivot to acting more presidential and less petulant ?

 live MJ phoner , an exasperated Scarborough reluctantly asked Trump about how " in the media , there have been some people who have taken still pictures to make it look like " his crowds are giving Nazi salutes , by which he presumably means " taking pictures of Trump 's crowd , " the sneaky devils . <p> Trump called the comparison a " stretch , " and said that this morning was the first he 'd heard of the controversy that 's been roiling since Saturday . <p> " They 're raising their hand in the form of a vote , " Trump explained , " not in the form of a salute . That is crazy . I ca n't believe that 's even being posed . " <p> Then Scarborough buttoned it up with this enthusiastic agreement : <p> All of us around the table , I think , actually agreed it was equally crazy , but just needed to ask it . <p> And this was n't even Scarborough 's most egregious bit of ; earlier in the show , he confessed that this was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ likened it to a Baptist worship service , and then told a great , big , fat lie ( emphasis mine ) : <p> Scarborough : This is the first time I 've actually seen the video .

Mike Barnicle , did that look like a Nazi salute to you ? " <p> Barnicle : No , no , no . <p> Mika : Are we really having this conversation ? <p> Scarborough : We 're really having this conversation because there are people at respected newspapers that are writing and they 're showing a quick clip when people first raised their hand to make it look like a fascist salute . <p> First of all , Baptist churches are n't like meetings of the Order of Stonecutters , people can actually check that , and no , there is no Baptist custom of raising your right hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wave or sway them if they catch the Holy Spirit , but it does n't look like this : <p> But more importantly , Joe Scarborough is lying . I 've seen this " pledge " story reported everywhere for days now , and only once has the full context , of Trump asking them to pledge to vote for him , not been included , and that was in the clip Scarborough played . It 's a self-evident lie because he makes that completely false claim right after saying he 's just seen the footage for the first time . <p> While it 's great that the Anglos at the Morning Joe table agree that the Jews and Jew-lovers are just " hyperventilating , " it 's importnt to at least here them out . Here 's the statement from Abe Foxman that Scarborough finds " crazy " : <p> " As a Jew who survived the Holocaust , to see an audience of thousands of people raising their hands in what looks like the ' Heil Hitler ' salute is about as offensive , obnoxious and disgusting as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States of America , " he told The Times of Israel . <p> " We 've seen this sort of thing at rallies of neo-Nazis . We 've seen it at rallies of white supremacists . But to see it at a rally for a legitimate candidate for the presidency of the United States is outrageous . " <p> " It is a fascist gesture , " Foxman said . " He is smart enough he always tells us how smart he is to know the images that this evokes . Instead of asking his audience to pledge allegiance to the United States of America , which in itself would be a little bizarre , he 's asking them to swear allegiance to him . " <p> Now , you can argue over whether Trump knew in advance how this would look , but once the crowd thrust those arms in the air , well , even Clayton Bigsby would recognize the visual it evoked .

 good , long look at that headline to make sure it really settles in . <p> The 2001 Tom Green comedy " Freddy Got Fingered " is about as goofy and admittedly low-brow of a comedy film as you would expect .

When his parents demand he leave , he begins to spread rumors that his father is sexually abusing Freddy . <p> Great , so now we 're caught up .

 Donald Trump supporters have this talent for stretching every which way to defend the indefensible , and tonight we reached another such low point on Fox News . <p> Trump supporter David Wohl defended The Donald tonight amid the fight over candidates ' wives .

Trump responded by attacking Cruz 's wife under the false belief that he was responsible for the ad , leading to Trump 's nasty tweet about Heidi Cruz 's looks . <p> But was it ? Wohl spun it thusly : <p> " Donald Trump responded with satire ! That was a satirical tweet of his wife next to Heidi Cruz ! " <p> I fail to see the " satire " in there .

 Dad Seeks to Unravel the History and Impact of Right-Wing Media <p> Documentarian Jen Senko never knew her father Frank to be a cigarette smoker so it was a little stunning when she witnessed him walk up to a group of smokers sitting outside a family favorite restaurant , take a generous inhale of their second-hand smoke , and boast , " I love the smell of cigarette smoke ! " <p> It may have had something to do with the fact that Rush Limbaugh Dad 's " hero " had been inveighing against the whole notion of harmful second-hand smoke , which he mocked as a liberal fantasy . Frank Senko was n't having any of that hokum . <p> Trailer for The Brainwashing of My Dad : <p> This was also during the same period when he refused to wear seat belts ( another Limbaugh scourge ) and railed against " feminazis " a period Senko described as " the height of his Limbaugh lunch days . " His daily habit of listening to Rush during his commute to work and at lunch , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full-bore multi-media diet of right-wing news and commentary coming at him via Fox , talk radio , and a glut of email newsletters , which he forwarded to his increasingly disconcerted family . It was , Senko says " almost like he joined a cult or joined a new religion . " <p> Senko 's new film The Brainwashing of My Dad is about the media apparatus that , in her words , " changed a father and divided a nation . " It 's an inquiry into how her amicable , " Kennedy Democrat " father , who was never particularly strident in his political views , became unrecognizably , caustically partisan , as well as hateful , angry , and intolerant of basically anyone who was n't white , male , middle class , and straight . <p> Using her father 's transformation as a starting point , Senko , who also co-directed 2009 's The Vanishing City , began making the film three years ago . Brainwashing was funded in part by Kickstarter backers who recognized Senko 's alienation from her father in their own family . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heads punctuating the film with descriptions of their own similar experiences : a chorus of exasperated sons , daughters , siblings , husbands , wives estranged from relatives who consume right-wing media and seem to inhabit an entirely different reality . " It hit me , " Senko said , " this is a phenomenon . " <p> The personal stories come through loud and clear and are hard to argue with . Where I suspect the film will court objection is in its ambition to unravel the history of the " vast right-wing conspiracy . " ( The film airs , and seeks to vindicate , those eternal words from the current Democratic frontrunner . ) <p> The particulars may be familiar to anyone who has a passing interest in these matters or who watched Rob Greenwald 's 2004 documentary Outfoxed : Rupert Murdoch 's War on Journalism . In an economical 90 minutes , Senko deftly weaves her family history with an American cultural history a five-decade saga of how establishment conservatives created a propaganda apparatus of think tanks , lobbying groups , publishing houses , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ articulated by Senko of redirecting the " insecurity of aging white men " into righteous anger at social movements . <p> " A Plan for Putting the GOP on TV News " a memo from the Nixon-era White House , which Gawker reported on in 2011 is treated like a smoking gun . The memo 's authorship is unclear , but it comes riddled with handwritten notes by Nixon 's television consultant Roger Ailes , the master of the young medium who would go on to be CEO of Fox News.The memo reads in part : <p> Today television news is watched more often than people read newspapers , than people listen to the radio , than people read or gather any other form of communication . The reason : People are lazy . With television you just sit watch listen . The thinking is done for you . <p> Senko draws a straight line from the once-fringe ideology of the John Birch Society to the Tea Party currently championed by Fox and taking up residence in the Party of Lincoln . We are told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conservative interests at Grover Norquist 's Wednesday meetings . That buzzwords ( like " death tax " ) are incubated in Frank Luntz focus groups and grow up to become broadcasted relentlessly to inculcate popular support for elite opinions . That talking points from Ailes cascade from early-morning memos down to the primetime arias of Bill O'Reilly and Sean Hannity . <p> As to the " brainwashing " claim of the title , cheekily illustrated by cartoons of Space Invaders and clips from The Manchurian Candidate ( 1962 , of course ) , Senko enlists a neuroscientist to explain how Fox News is guilty of " brainwashing by stealth , " assiduously calibrating the high emotional intensity of its shows to get viewers riled up , among other tactics . ( Media Matters ' Eric Boehlert calls the network a " phony outrage machine . " ) Senko pieces together montages of O'Reilly railing against the specious " War on Christmas , " or preposterously likening the ACLU to al-Qaeda to drive home the absurd hyperboles . <p> The film 's message is clear : the assembly of the right-wing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goal of turning a generation of middle-aged , middle-class white Americans into angry dittoheads . " We 've sort of ignored it , " Senko told Mediaite . " There really was a vast right-wing conspiracy . " <p> At this point ( and probably much , much earlier like when you heard the film 's premise ) , you 're either nodding your head vigorously or dismissing Senko 's project as liberal propaganda of the lowest order . In that way , the film is perhaps both a victim , and example , of the polarization it endeavors to illuminate . ( " My guy is a journalist ; your guy is a propagandist . " ) <p> Centrist it is n't . No one is going to mistake Brainwashing as politically agnostic . A final title card encourages viewers to seek edification at sites like Media Matters , TruthOut , Alternet progressive media outlets that are likely familiar and loathed with a white-hot hatred by many of the people Senko is trying to reach . <p> Also , by positing that a cabal of media Svengalis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neglects the very real social and cultural forces that drive voter attitudes . And it also , frankly , let 's people who espouse extreme , hateful ideologies off the hook for their retrograde beliefs as if Americans are simply unwitting , empty vessels for whatever media they consume . ( Though certainly some will argue that Dad 's change of heart once he starts ingesting reporting from the progressive TruthOut suggests as much . ) <p> But Senko also makes an inarguable , if well-worn , point : that our media intake has a profound and often unacknowledged impact on how we view the world , on what we consider truth , and moreover , what we consider a trustworthy source . " You have to watch what you eat , " she said . " You can get influenced . " <p> Does that caveat not extend , then , to Senko 's own movie a movie that has no patience for anti-gay , anti-feminist , or racist views , while still exhibiting sympathy for those " afflicted " with them ? <p> Senko admitted that her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It 's a movie and it has to entertain or no one will go see it , " she said , " and yes it has a personal story involved so there is emotion . I guess people will have to decide for themselves if they are being manipulated . " <p> Take issue with the film 's claims or ( and this will require slightly more legwork ) with its reporting , but one thing is rendered with unambiguous clarity : In documenting her relationship with her father ( who passed away shortly before the film 's release ) , Senko has drawn an affecting portrait of a family scattered across seemingly unbridgeable ideological divides and , in doing so , captured a microcosm of our current national predicament . <p> For those who are willing to engage with Senko 's film in good faith , Brainwashing is a nimbly assembled , mercifully rancor-free , often funny , and always earnest appeal to our better natures . It 's a plea to open our minds , to privilege reason over emotion , facts over feelings , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wide as they may be . <p> Senko 's advice is straightforward enough : " Always fact-check . " The problem , of course , is where ? <h> Devout come to

By all accounts , it is the former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton whose experience seems to indicate a larger and more substantive understanding of global politics . <p> However , one of the primary reasons that Hawaii state Congresswoman Tulsi from her position in the DNC last month was because of an upstream conviction that it was Sanders not Clinton best suited to make decisions abroad .

 on Importance of the White Vote <p> Independent Vermont Senator and upstart Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders may soon earn the nickname " Mr. Plow , " since the whiter it gets , the more he cleans up . Over the weekend , Sanders put up huge margins of victory in Washington and Alaska and narrowed his gap with Hillary Clinton in pledged delegates to under 300 . His success in white-dominated caucus states led CNN 's Jake Tapper to ask Sanders an uncomfortable question on Sunday 's State of the Union . " Back in 2008 , Hillary Clinton touted her support with white voters , " Tapper reminded viewers , an uncomfortable observation for Hillary Clinton . He continued , " This year , you seem to be doing well with that group . Do you agree with Clinton 's 2008 assessment that the white working-class is pivotal to Democratic chances in November ? " <p> I think every vote is pivotal . We are now winning in state after state the Latino vote . We 're doing better now that we 're out of the South with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people .

" <p> A better question , though , might have been whether Bernie agreed with another , more recent assessment of the importance of white voters in a general election , from November of 2014 : <p> It 's smart politics for Bernie to abandon his evangelizing for white voters now , but the real test will come if and when he narrows Clinton 's lead in pledged delegates , and has to make a convincing argument for Superdelegates to flip their support to him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a case against a Republican nominee like Donald Trump . <p> Zayn Malik released

But in 2016 however , the host city of this summer 's games -- Rio de Janeiro , Brazil is in such economic , social , and health-related turmoil that the games are already cast in a dark shadow . <p> The situation has grown so dire that now the Brazilian government is considering buying remaining tickets and giving them to public school children , according to an interview that Ricardo Leyser , the country 's brand new minister of sports , gave to the newspaper Folha . <p> Here 's a quick rundown of the litany of issues currently facing the country of Brazil : <p> Brazilians are looking for regime change .

 Basically Hijacked Part of Fox News ' Cruz Town Hall <p> So something pretty awkward happened this morning : a big chunk of a Fox News town hall ended up airing on MSNBC . <p> A lot of these network town halls are taped hours in advance before you watch them in primetime . Apparently this Ted Cruz Megyn Kelly one -- which you would expect would have first aired on Fox -- kinda sorta first aired on a competitor . <p> Which is kind of awkward . <p> MSNBC 's Tamron Hall intro to their live feed of the town hall was a bit awkward , as was the long awkward pause that followed as Fox was getting ready to tape the next segment of the town hall . <p> Please enable Javascript to watch . <p> MSNBC only showed 12 minutes of it , but it was still pretty weird .

 not chewing over the latest Donald Trump controversy , the political media is hard at work obsessing over " delegate math , " which is like regular math mixed with sleeping pills . On Tuesday morning 's Good Morning America , ABC News political commentator Matthew Dowd attempted to inject some suspense into the Democratic contest by asserting that insurgent candidate Bernie Sanders has a better chance of overtaking frontrunner Hillary Clinton 's lead in pledged delegates than Ted Cruz does of taking the delegate lead from Donald Trump : <p> Please enable Javascript to watch . <p> Ted Cruz has less of a chance of passing Donald Trump than Bernie Sanders does . Bernie Sanders has a better chance of passing Hillary Clinton among pledged delegates than Ted Cruz in passing Donald Trump . <p> As a matter of math , Dowd is correct , Bernie Sanders is much closer to Hillary Clinton in pledged delegates than Cruz is to Trump , but this is delegate math , so comparing these two races is n't that simple . While Democratic delegates are awarded proportionally , Republican states can choose some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opportunities to catch up that Sanders wo n't have . On the other hand , the larger Republican field means that neither Trump nor Cruz has a great shot at securing the majority of delegates needed to secure the nomination . <p> The fact is , though , that neither runner-up has a great chance of overtaking their party 's respective frontrunners at this point , which leaves most of the drama to occur on the sidelines . <p> Suspect 1 is 
 and months of ambiguous promises , Donald Trump has finally presented a method for how he would force Mexico to pay for the construction of a wall across the national border . The plan : threaten the Mexican economy with a policy that would block immigrants from making any financial transferences to their home country . <p> Immigration has been one of Trump 's political cornerstones since the beginning of his campaign , and his proposals and rhetoric have drawn theire of many people along the way . In a memo received by the Washington Post , Trump 's campaign wrote that they wanted to change anti-terror laws of the Patriot Act and cut off portions of remittance until the Mexican government coughs up a " one-time payment of billion " for the wall . <p> " It 's an easy decision for Mexico , " the memo states .

Economically , Forbes noted how much of the funds sent in by immigrants are used to stabilize the nation 's struggling economy , and provide backing to impoverished families . This also does not account for the fact that estimate that the wall 's cost would exceed the figures put out by the Trump campaign . <p> Washington Post also noted that the proposal could end up testing the bounds of executive power , tying up international economics , and setting off an economic war with Mexico . <h> Pittsburgh Mayor Peduto 
 Possibility of Leaving Fox News <p> Fox host Megyn Kelly said she was leaving open the possibility of leaving her network once her contract expires next year . <p> In an interview with Variety published Tuesday , Kelly discussed Fox 's clashes with Donald Trump over what the candidate has sought to characterize as her poor treatment of him .

 Out of Reagan Alzheimer 's Comedy <p> Actor Will Ferrell has backed out of a movie that would have made light of President Ronald Reagan 's battle with Alzheimer 's after the premise received condemnation . <p> " The REAGAN script is one of a number of scripts that had been submitted to Will Ferrell which he had considered , " Ferrell 's agent told The New York Post . " While it is by no means a ' Alzheimer 's comedy ' as has been suggested , Mr. Ferrell is not pursuing this project . " <p> According to a report from Variety , Ferrell would have played Reagan at the beginning of his second term , when the fictional version of Reagan would develop dementia .

 surprise that during Donald Trump 's Retweet candidacy here in 2016 , there has n't been a whole lot of fact-checking that has gone on to many of the wild assertions the frontrunner has been making on the stump .

The senior Cruz told a reporter Monday , " I implore , I exhort every member of the body of Christ to vote according to the word of God and vote for the candidate that stands on the word of God and on the Constitution of the United States of America .

 few years , I 've read a lot of books about news broadcasting , a lot of books about feminist theory , and a few books that combine the two . Most recently , I 've been digging into Fox darling Andrea Tantaros ' Tied Up in Knots : How Getting What We Wanted Made Women Miserable . Although I have n't yet finished entirely and , thus , have not yet gotten around to writing what I am sure will be the book review of all book reviews , one passage has been getting some traction today and I feel compelled to address it . That passage is the opening anecdote from Tied Up in Knots ' second chapter , " Twisted Sisters , " and it is a hypocritical swipe at another woman in the industry . <p> Tantaros , who has been mysteriously missing from Fox 's line-up since the day after this book came out , is a staple here at Mediaite because she can always be counted on to say something shocking . Just read some of the headlines we 've written about her proclamations here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ news cycle . She makes her assertions with no shame and never , ever backs down on them . Her brand of punditry is a necessary part of how commentary works these days . <p> In contrast to Tantaros , there is Mika Brzezinski of Morning Joe . She 's level-headed and serves to reel Joe Scarborough back in whenever he gets too feisty early in the morning . She , too , is a necessary presence in the so-called " infotainment " sphere . That 's why she is also a staple here at Mediaite , where we cover the personalities that deliver the news as closely as those who make it . <p> Cable news fans were undoubtedly shocked to crack Knots and be confronted with an unkind look at Brzezinski on page 12 . By her own telling , after she went full-time at Fox , Tantaros stopped appearing on other networks , but remained friendly with them . Brzezinski allegedly did not remain friendly with Tantaros , dramatically pretending not to recognize her for a protracted period of time at a charity function before quipping , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preeeettty . " <p> If that really happened , it was a disappointing move on Brzezinski 's part , but how Tantaros countered is even more vile . Tantaros read up on Brzezinski , then waited five years to use a book that is ostensibly about helping other women break free from a unique sort of bonds to question whether the MSNBC host attacked her because of residual self-doubt left over from previous struggles with eating disorders . <p> No , I 'm not lying . Tantaros wrote a book under the guise of helping other women and in that book , she wrote , " Mika had written about struggling with eating disorders in her book Obsessed . Was that why she felt the need to cut down people like me ? Was it self-doubt and malicious insecurity ? " <p> A low blow like that especially one that is dealt after holding a grudge for five years is unconscionable . <p> Worse yet , Tantaros went on to dedicate the entire chapter to how mystifying and certain it is that all women " hate each other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sisters " chapter by asserting , " Anytime estrogen is involved , there is bound to be drama . " <p> That is pure fiction . I am the proud owner of two X chromosomes and I can vouch that drama does not follow me into my relationships with other women . In fact , I prioritize those relationships and value every woman in my life , even those with whom I fundamentally disagree on major issues . Perhaps Tantaros ' presence is the harbinger of drama . Maybe her idea that it is " bound to be " in all female interaction comes from the fact that she is surrounded by the drama she herself brings . <p> As I mentioned earlier , drama is part of her brand . Wild assumptions and borderline inappropriate interjections are what have propelled her to infamy over at Fox and , again , there is a place for that in the industry . Her knack for dramatics is exemplified in her decision to wait five years to drop a blow on Brzezinski over an incident that it is very likely the older @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> To use a book meant to help women untie the knots of modern existence to shove another woman 's eating disorder back in her face and generalize that all women are dramatic and silly is irresponsible and cruel . If Tantaros ever gets her job at Fox back , she owes Brzezinski a massive apology . <p> As far as why she lost that job in the first place ( although Fox insists it is only a temporary thing ) , I think it is safe to assume that it had something to do with , well , drama . <h> Conservative protesters are

 to Edit Briefing Video to Remove Admission of Falsehood <p> Fox News 's James Rosen called out the State Department Monday , accusing them of deleting a damaging exchange from their archive video of a December 2013 press briefing . <p> In 2012 , Rosen had the following exchange with State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland . <p> ROSEN : There have been reports that intermittently , and outside of the formal P5+1 mechanisms , the Obama Administration , or members of it , have conducted direct secret bilateral talks with Iran . Is that true or false ? " <p> NULAND : We have made clear , as the Vice President did at Munich , that in the context of the larger P5+1 framework , we would be prepared to talk to Iran bilaterally . But with regard to the kind of thing that you 're talking about on a government-to-government level , no . <p> Nuland 's answer contradicts what we now know to be true . In a profile with The New York Times , national security advisor Ben Rhodes admitted that the White House secretly sought out nuclear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far back as 2011 . <p> In 2013 , after initial reports emerged that the Iran deal was negotiated earlier than the White House let on , Rosen confronted Nuland 's successor Jen Psaki . But when Rosen went back to pull the video of that confrontation for a Fox News segment years later , he noticed that his questions had been edited out . <p> " Late today , we discovered that the State Department 's video of its December 2 , 2013 press briefing , at which I confronted spokesperson Jen Psaki ... has itself , with the use of a white flash , been deleted from both the State Department 's official website and from its YouTube channel , " he reported during Monday night 's edition of Special Report . <p> Rosen claimed that in the deleted section of the video , Psaki " effectively admitted " that the administration lied to him , citing " privacy " concerns . <p> The version of the briefing posted on YouTube does appear to be truncated , with a white flash appearing twenty-seven minutes in that cuts just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Please enable Javascript to watch . <p> In the deleted remarks , Rosen directly asks Psaki whether it 's the State Department 's policy to lie to reporters in order to preserve secret negotiations . Psaki gives an answer that , at best , does n't rule the idea out . <p> ROSEN : Is it the policy of the State Department , where the preservation or the secrecy of secret negotiations is concerned , to lie in order to achieve that goal ? <p> PSAKI : James , I think there are times where diplomacy needs privacy in order to progress . This is a good example of that . Obviously , we have made clear and laid out a number of details in recent weeks about discussions and about a bilateral channel that fed into the P5+1 negotiations , and we 've answered questions on it , we 've confirmed details . We 're happy to continue to do that , but clearly , this was an important component leading up to the agreement that was reached a week ago . <p> Once again , 
 to denials from spokespeople , the devil is always in what is n't being said ... <p> Take Facebook 's recent controversy over its alleged censorship of conservative news and topics . Anonymous sources -- former news curators there say they witnessed such actions happening . According to one source in an interview with Gizmodo , " Depending on who was on shift , things would be blacklisted or trending . I 'd come on shift and I 'd discover that CPAC or Mitt Romney or Glenn Beck or popular conservative topics would n't be trending because either the curator did n't recognize the news topic or it was like they had a bias against Ted Cruz . " <p> And according to other news curators per Gizmodo 's Michael Nunez , they were " instructed to artificially ' inject ; selected stories into the trending news module , even if they were n't popular enough to warrant inclusion or in some cases were n't trending at all . The former curators , all of whom worked as contractors , also said they were directed not to include news @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As a result , these kind of items were allegedly kept off Facebook 's coveted trending news sidebar . With over 1.1 billion members worldwide , getting on said sidebar is kind of a big deal . So big , in fact , that the Senate Commerce Committee which resides over media issues , internet communications and consumer protection issues just sent a letter today to Facebook senior management requesting answers to questions it has on the way it decides what qualifies for its trending topics section . <p> So is it true ? This is all based on anonymous sources , after all . We do n't know if these people have an ax to grind with the company . We also do n't know if they are , say ... conservative activists or Donald Trump supporters looking to avenge Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg 's recent public statements blasting the presumptive GOP nominee 's immigration stance ( " Facebook founder " being a generous term , given he basically stole the whole idea from the Winklevoss twins while at Harvard , who each failed to have him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another time ) . <p> So is this a case of innocent whistleblowers who simply felt compelled to speak out in the interest of truth ? Or is there a political or personal motive here ? Answer : Nobody really knows right now , but it 's attracting big-time attention now regardless . <p> Facebook was noticeably silent after the news broke early Monday morning , but the company finally came out with a statement more than 12 hours later when the story really picked up steam , primarily in conservative media , largely thanks to Drudge making it the lead story . Again , before reading the company response , remember the rule we began this column with . When it comes to denials from spokespeople ( or in this case , VP Tom Stocky ) : " The devil is always in what is n't being said ... " ( emphasis mine ) : <p> " We take allegations of bias very seriously . Facebook is a platform for people and perspectives from across the political spectrum . Trending Topics shows you the popular topics and hashtags that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guidelines in place for the review team to ensure consistency and neutrality . These guidelines do not permit the suppression of political perspectives . Nor do they permit the prioritization of one viewpoint over another or one news outlet over another . These guidelines do not prohibit any news outlet from appearing in Trending Topics . " <p> Let 's unpack that by asking a few more questions , shall we ? <p> Is there a direct denial took place ? No . The statement lamely and repeatedly points to " rigorous guidelines " as a reason this could n't ever possibly happen . To illustrate why this is so lame , think of it this way : <p> You 're a newspaper or magazine reporter in the 1990s . You get a tip that a over-the-counter brokerage company named Stratton Oakmont , founded and run by millionaire Jordan Belfort ( who may or may not resemble Leonardo DiCaprio ) , is conducting business in a very shady , very illegal way . You also hear via a former employee who was fired for feeding his ( now-late @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ huge IPO that hookers , cocaine and midgets used for entertainment are a regular presence at the firm . So you contact Stratton Oakmont 's spokesperson , who eventually issues the following statement : <p> " We take allegations of bias very seriously . Stratton Oakmont has rigorous guidelines against the presence of drugs , prostitutes and little people used for the purposes of comic relief . These guidelines do not permit such actions to take place in a work environment . " <p> See how that works ? <p> In a related story , which is patently ironic and perhaps telling , the Facebook controversy was a trending story on Monday . But somehow not on Facebook , of course , but Twitter ... another social media platform recently accused by some conservatives like Breitbart 's Milo Yiannopoulos of suppressing members of a certain ideology . On cue , Facebook proceeded to put out another statement . Not from Zuckerberg or CEO Sheryl Sandberg , mind you , but again from Tom Stocky , who apparently conducted and completed a full investigation in the time it takes to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are the interesting parts : <p> " We take these reports extremely seriously , and have found no evidence that the anonymous allegations are true , " later adding , " Trending Topics is designed to showcase the current conversation happening on Facebook . Popular topics are first surfaced by an algorithm , then audited by review team members to confirm that the topics are in fact trending news in the real world and not , for example , similar-sounding topics or misnomers . " <p> So given there is a human element , and guessing that since the average age of a Facebook employee is just 29 years old the whole **34;1244;TOOLONG does have the real possibility of being skewed leftward . Pew Research shows that more than half of millennials identify as Democrats , while only about one in three call themselves Republicans . If you 're Stocky , perhaps the wiser choice of action would be to conduct a full investigation the kind that takes more than less than a day to complete before definitively declaring there is n't a problem . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It may be a social media platform first , but Facebook is very much a media outlet as well in terms of sharing news and information . It was only a matter of time until it was included in the conservation and accused of something along the lines of bias , because almost every other outlet already is . <p> Whether this is a fair accusation is something that remains to be seen . <h> Congressional IT desk 
 Comment on Removal of Last North Korea Report by Expelled Journalist <p> After filing what the country identified as " disrespectful " reports , North Korea yesterday expelled a BBC team of journalists , flying the team back to Beijing on a direct flight from Pyongyang .

" The secretary general of the DPRK 's National Peace Committee went on to say , " The journalists were speaking very i 'll of the system of the leadership of the country when they should have been reporting very fairly , objectively and very correctly . " <p> Wingfield-Hayes and his team are not allowed back to the hermit kingdom . " We think that if the BBC is a genuine , true , international media organization you should be acting in such a way as to respect the law and system in the country , and you must admit your mistakes , " the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ report from Pyongyang , Wingfield-Hayes admitted , " So now our minders are rather upset with us because we tried to do a piece to camera in front of the statue of Kim Il Sung here and they clearly felt that we said stuff that was not respectful to the Great Leader and now we are in trouble . " The team of journalists were forced to delete much of their captured content . <p> Wingfield-Hayes ' piece focused on the North Korean political and social ideology known as Juche , which is typically translated to " self-reliance .

 the most direct line of rhetoric out of the Obama administration yet regarding the highly contentious debate over the rights of the transgender community , a " sweeping directive " is being issued to all US public schools today . <p> A letter from the White House is expected to go out Friday to all school districts in the nation to allow transgender students to use the bathrooms that match the gender that they identify with , not necessarily that of their birth . This is the most widespread and visible effort from the President on the issue yet , and a topic of national conversation that the administration has weighed in on for several years . <p> The New York Timesreports , " It does not have the force of law , but it contains an implicit threat : Schools that do not abide by the Obama administration 's interpretation of the law could face lawsuits or a loss of federal aid .

 headline already gives away , the question of the day is this : <p> Do the personal , not political , but personal actions of someone 25 years ago outside of committing a major crime resonate in any capacity with the general public ? <p> The question is prompted , of course , by a Washington Post report today that Donald Trump used to impersonate his own spokesman to brag about himself to reporters . Of course , Trump denies the voice on the tape obtained is him in a testy interview with NBC 's Savannah Guthrie this morning and scolded the Today anchor for even broaching the topic as the first question of his interview . Said report is likely the first of many if the cadre of Post reporters ( 20 ) assigned to dig up everything in Trump 's past is any indication ( still no word on how many reporters are assigned to the likely Democratic nominee , but here 's betting it ai n't close to 20 ) . <p> Update : The paper now says in responding to Fox 's The Five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to investigate Clinton . It 's still not clear why Bob Woodward only mentioned Trump when broaching the 20 reporter investigation . Only after two days and notable blowback did the paper decide to be " transparent . " Check . <p> Regardless , will anyone -- voters outside the bubble care about this latest revelation ? Trump once declared he could walk out onto 5th Avenue and shoot somebody and most people now backing him still would . And based on everything we 've seen for these crazy 11 months since that now infamous escalator ride down to his announcement at Trump Tower ... the McCain insult , the Carly insult , the Megyn , the revelations about Trump University , the Heidi Cruz insults , the insults of basically every GOP candidate once in the race ( Jim Gilmore somehow escaped unscathed ) , the softening of stances and outright flip-flops on others , know this : It all does n't matter . His numbers keep going up despite historically high unfavorables that somehow best his **33;490;TOOLONG opponent in Hillary Clinton . In the end , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forgive if the contents keep changing inside . And despite being caught in more than a few lies , he still somehow keeps an aura of authenticity to him . Do n't bother applying logic here ... this is what it is . <p> Several polls this week and yes , it 's still early with 178 days to go -- show Trump essentially tied with Clinton both nationally ( Reuters dead heat at 41-40 with 19 percent undecided ) and in key states such as Florida , Pennsylvania and Ohio ( Quinnipiac ) . The Trump train just keeps moving along , and you have to start to wonder if the Post by assigning so many reporters to one person clearly in the interest of taking him down is n't playing right into Trump 's hands . Per his interview with Fox 's Sean Hannity Thursday night : <p> " Every hour we 're getting calls from reporters from The Washington Post asking ridiculous questions . And I will tell you , this is owned as a toy by Jeff Bezos ... Amazon is getting away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Post for power so that the politicians in Washington do n't tax Amazon like they should be taxed . " <p> And earlier today with the aforementioned Guthrie : <p> Trump : Wow . You mean you are going so low as to talk about something that took place 25 years ago , about whether or not I made a phone call ? I guess you 're saying under a presumed name . <p> Guthrie : Yes , under a presumed name . <p> Trump : Okay . The answer is no . Let 's get on to more current subjects . I know it 's wonderful for your listeners , but we have more important things to discuss . <p> The whole thing brings back memories of 2008 and a tactic Clinton chief strategist Mark Penn of repeatedly mentioning President Obama 's past cocaine use while in college ( which he wisely admitted to in his memoir , Dreams of My Father ) . <p> Per MSNBC 's Hardball in December of 2007 : <p> CHRIS MATTHEWS : David Gregory , the old slogan was , " Things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helping ? Is it helping Barack , being the victim of what looks like a dirty attack , or is it helping Hillary by diminishing the electability quotient of Barack Obama next November ? <p> DAVID GREGORY : Well , if that 's her intention , if that 's the Clinton campaign 's intention , they seem to be missing the mark here . The question of his electability , of his strength and his experience that 's exactly where they want to attack him , but that 's not what 's happening now . <p> I mean , what was striking last night on this program is that here is Hillary Clinton 's chief strategist not just message man , strategist , her guru , besides her husband , the guy who has predicted historic female voting patterns for Hillary Clinton , the guy who 's written a book about all the microtrends in the country and yet he 's on this program , and he 's saying , " Well , we 're not raising the cocaine issue , " even though he says " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " -- Obama " started getting mean before we did , " and that , " Oh , by the way , he 's too ambitious , " something that nobody would accuse the Clintons of . <p> So if that 's a sign of where their campaign is -- <p> MATTHEWS : Yeah . <p> GREGORY : on the heels of Bill Clinton attacking the press and misstating his position about the Iraq war , it 's a sign of defensiveness . <p> So did voters care about Mr. Obama 's drug use 25 years prior ? Not one bit . It got chalked up as a college thing and if anything , it only made the Clinton campaign which already knew it was in big trouble look somewhat desperate for even broaching it . <p> Same goes here with this Post report about Trump : Did he call reporters in the early 90s to brag about himself ? Hard to put that past him . But is this really what one of the nation 's top newspapers is going to be offering up for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do likewise to Mrs. Clinton who likely has a full closet of her own will it only embolden Trump 's argument that the media is corrupt ? <p> Do the personal , not political , but personal actions of someone 25 years ago outside of committing a major crime resonate in any capacity with the general public ? The bet here is no if the last open election season is any indication ... especially with something as flimsy as what the Post just breathlessly reported as a big story on its once-hallowed pages this morning . <p> With Trump , there are plenty of areas to scrutinize -- particularly when it comes to policy specifics and changing positions . <p> The Post can do so much better , but really hurt is credibility moving forward when it comes to Trump on this one ... <p> BOSTON ( CBS

Demanding that every public school now allow grown men and boys into the little girls ' bathroom . We have entered the world of politically correct lunacy . <p> ... And there is nothing in the Constitution that gives the president the power to be the bathroom police for this country .

 Away Half of Donald Trump 's VP List , and Sarah Palin is On It <p> Former Republican presidential frontrunner and current member of Donald Trump 's vice-presidential selection committee Ben Carson let some major cats out of the bag this weekend , assuming he 's really in the loop . According to The Washington Post 's Ben Terris , Carson confirmed five names , including former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin , on a Veep shortlist that 's supposedly already been cut down to five or six names : <p> Ben Carson , the neurosurgeon turned presidential candidate turned unfiltered pitchman for Donald Trump and now part of the presumptive nominee 's vice presidential search committee , sat in the back of a Town Car with his wife , Candy , on his way to a televised interview .

 then received top billing on The Drudge Report 's banner , which gave it massive exposure and set off accusations among Trump fans on social media that Facebook was snubbing Trump conservatives . There 's only one problem : literally none of that is true . <p> It is true that of the group of conservative invited to the Facebook meeting includes anti-Trump conservatives like Glenn Beck , S.E. Cupp , and Dana Perino . But that 's because if you took a random sample of conservatives in any context , a huge chunk of them would be opposed to Trump . Many of the first conservatives to announce they were attending the meeting were anti-Trump , but not all or even most of them are . <p> If you read the Breitbart piece in question , they tacitly admit as much : <p> It is also important to point out that nearly every " leading conservative " listed above who has accepted and confirmed their attendance on Wednesday is part of the anti-Trump or " Never Trump " movement . The move to invite from this school of " conservatives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creating a diverse group for the discussion . <p> " Nearly " everyone is anti-Trump ?

Yep , this is the next paragraph . <p> One exception is former Romney strategist Zac Moffatt , who has stated his willingness to work with Trump . " Of course we would work for the RNC under Trump , " Moffatt said . <p> So usually , as a journalist , this is the part when you stop : after adding something to your piece that blows up the entire premise . But at Brietbart , cognitive dissonance is more of a feature than a bug and they braved on . <p> If that was n't enough to definitely refute the accusation , The Hill reported the same morning that Trump advisor Barry Bennett was invited to the Facebook meeting .

 you more about why the Iranian Revolutionary Guards Corps , which is an organization set up to protect Iran 's Islamic foundations and prevent the interference of foreigners , said Kim Kardashian is a secret agent , I would like to present a few things to you . <p> Consider all of the following : <p> 1 . Kardashian is the child of a woman who is arguably the most brilliant PR strategist of all time . Kris Jenner has spent her adult years forging relationships with media personalities , paparazzi personnel , and well-to-do people and it has paid off . She dragged no less than 10 members of her family to fame while working quietly and diligently in the background as a " momager . " Say what you will about the Kardashians and yes , I 'm sure you will say plenty , since it is very trendy to hate them for banal reasons right now -- but they are all wildly savvy businesspeople who learned from Jenner how to negotiate and social climb . If anyone could be a secret agent , it 's that woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it 's spread the success around to all of her kids . <p> 2 . Kardashian has gone undercover and incognito before . Here is a video of the fashion maven titled " plotting and planning . " She is hiding from the paps in plain sight . That 's a spy skill . <p> 3 . Here she is donning a full costume that drastically changed her appearance ( via the Daily Mail ) . She has unfettered access to makeup artists , hair stylists , and outfit coordinators 24/7 ; have you ever considered that her " glam team " is something more covert than she let 's on ? <p> 4 . She has certain skills that do n't really jive with her public persona . Watch here to see Kardashian seamlessly park a truck that is much too large for a very small woman and then try to tell me she has n't been trained to operate combat vehicles : <p> So , listen : I 'm not saying she is or is not some type of international spy . I do n't want to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little bit less cautious . The Iranian Revolutionary Guards Guards is among them . On Sunday , the Organized Cyberspace Crimes Unit of the Revolutionary Guards dedicated an entire news broadcast to their theory that she is working in cahoots with the CEO of Instagram to inspire young women in the country to buck morality and Islamic tradition in favor of private jets and hair extensions . <p> According to People , this is what was said in the broadcast by the unit 's spokesperson , Mostafa Alizadeh : <p> Ms. Kim Kardashian is a popular fashion model so Instagram 's CEO tells her , ' Make this native . " There is no doubt that financial support is involved as well . We are taking this very seriously . <p> Also according to People , when Kardashian was asked about this rumor by a reporter at Cannes , she said this : <p> " What ? For who ?

She said it 's " possible that some of these folks do n't like Trump or Republicans and wanted to see me take him out .

Bila instantly cited Clinton 's perceived mishandling of the Benghazi attacks as the reason she is seen as untrustworthy and unfit to lead . Everyone began arguing , but Paula Faris gamely told the crew to settle down so Bila could finish . <p> Sunny Hostin countered by telling Bila that Trump 's immediate characterization of the downed EgyptAir plane as a terrorist attack when no Islamic groups have claimed was out of line , then read a long list of lies told by Trump that have been fact-checked and disproven .

She was talking so fast that it was almost difficult to make out what she said , but at the end of her speedy speech , when Behar asked if Bila would prefer a liar whose actions she could n't predict over a liar whose actions she could , she simply said , " Yes !

If you looked away for a second to avoid getting hit , and heard the sounds of the barrier being slammed , you might reasonably perceive , in the heat of that moment , that the chair was thrown . You look back and see people helping someone up off the floor . The metallic noises continue . <p> It 's also still possible that the folks onstage did see something like chair-throwing or flipping that was n't caught on camera .

Using governmental power to root out dissent from big-government orthodoxy follows naturally enough . <p> One clear goal of this strategy is to discredit dissenters by tying them to an energy giant .

 1237 delegates to clinch the Republican nomination . As of Thursday morning he has 1238 , according to the AP . <p> Trump reached the magic number after a number of unpledged delegates told the AP that they would support him , including Oklahoma GOP chairwoman Pam Pollard . <p> " I think he has touched a part of our electorate that does n't like where our country is , " Pollard told the AP .

 Times made a curious editorial decision yesterday regarding the picture they picked to go with their article about Donald Trump 's speech before the Rolling Thunder motorcyclists in Washington D.C. <p> In their piece , the Times described how Trump addressed an " incongruous constituency " at this event , which was basically his way of pushing his military and veterans talking points for Memorial Day weekend . The Rolling Thunder Rally is meant to ' honor educate , facilitate , and never forget by means of a demonstration for service members that were abandoned after the Vietnam War . ' But even as the Times covered the high points of Trump 's rally , they also brought up the lows along with notes about how his relationship with veterans is complicated to saythe least . <p> However , in what might have been the most peculiar part of the article , though , the Times decided that their top featured image from the event would be one with a Trump-supporting biker with the Confederate Flag patched on the back of his jacket . <p> The picture 's use has some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the Times brought up how Trump was upset that yesterday 's event was n't big enough to Luther King Jr .

The Confederate Flag is still seen by many as pro-racist symbol , and between this and Trump 's hesitation to denounce his white supremacist supporters in the past , it throws water on any desire to make a comparison to MLK . <p> Another factor worth consideration is that the Times decided to go with the picture of the flag when there were many images from the rally for them to choose from . In fact , we reviewed coverage from several different mainstream media outlets and we did n't find anyone else featuring an image with the Confederate Flag . Trump 's event received a great deal of media coverage as per usual , and even though the Times ' flag picture is n't blown up or exceptionally blatant , there were plenty of pictures available where the controversial image is not seen . <p> Finally , it does bear mention that the New York Times has faced enormous friction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , especially when their coverage has turned negativeor problematic for him .

 HBO of Making Misleading Edits to Interview <p> The inventor of the AR-15 rifle accused HBO Tuesday of making selective edits to an interview that aired in an episode of Real Sports w/ Bryant Gumbel . <p> Jim Sullivan 's comments began making waves within the pro-gun blogosphere after he appeared to tell host Bryant Gumbel that he never envisioned that the AR-15 would be sold for civilian use , that it had the most lethal rounds in human history , and that it was just as deadly as its military counterpart the M-16 rifle . The last assertion was particularly controversial , given that the AR-15 is semi-automatic while the M-16 is fully automatic . <p> In a Tuesday guest editorial for The Federalist , Sullivan claimed that his words had been twisted by HBO . " They were apparently trying to make the AR-15 civilian model seem too dangerous for civilian sales , " he wrote .

 , former Secretary of State and current Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton has faced varying levels of sexism and misogyny from opponents and the media , but gender bias can be so pervasive that it even slips into otherwise friendly spaces . For example , on Friday night 's All In with Chris Hayes , the topic was how Hillary Clinton has been kicking the living crap out of Donald Trump this week , which , no matter your political preference , is simply an observable fact .

Calling ( Trump 's ) policy positions " rants . " That he 's thin-skinned .

Something that , again , no other Republican was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Speaking of interesting word choices , Plank 's use of the qualifier " quote-unquote " seems to be an acknowledgement that she understands the problem with the phrase , yet values the utility of the shorthand enough to deploy it anyway , and Hayes , also a feminist , goes right along with it . or not , what does it say to our daughters that dominating a male opponent is an inherently masculine activity ? And what , exactly , was " almost masculine " about anything Hillary did this week ? I 've watched women stand up to others my entire life , and never has it ever occurred to me think of it as " masculine . " Even if you accept gender stereotypes , which a guy my age is certainly steeped in , Hillary did n't engage in any behavior that remotely fits those , other than kicking his ass . Women can kick ass . <p> This is the flip side of other liberals ' attempt to feminize Trump , as exemplified by Bill Maher 's declaration that " Lady Trump @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inherently inferior traits on Trump by using slurs against women . It 's also part of something that rarely , if ever , gets called out : the use of Trump 's penis size to insult him . It is a window into Trump 's insecurity that he took the extraordinary step of responding to Marco Rubio 's insult at a nationally televised debate , but Trump opponents who glory in trolling Trump by insisting he really does have a small penis are similarly imparting inherent power to a masculine trait . If Trump is weak because he has a small penis , then what does that say to people who have no penis at all ?

The point is , he is an instrument of the death and theft and rape and violence that has been inflicted time and time again upon this miserable continent . He has tried to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but of course , it 's a futile endeaveor , because even when you throw down your sword and become a man of God ... there are always other Gods . <p> So it is in the episodes 's final scene , which is perhaps perfunctory , but still grisly , in which the acolytes of the Lord of Light set upon the little band of Seven worshippers and slaughter them all in their tracks . ( Why did n't they burn them ? I wonder . ) <p> Religious extremism has never been far from the show 's focus . We witnessed the Lord of Light 's priestess roast innocent children alive , and now their roaming missionaries butcher men , women , and children by the dozen . But of course , as noble as the Septon played by McShane was , espousing the virtues of tolerance and nonviolence , it is important to remember that any religion , given an iota of power , is utterly toxic . The Faith of the Seven in King 's Landing , newly institutionalized as the state religion under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true colors . The Faith betrays many of the same conspicuously misogynistic signs of its real-world counterparts , as when the High Sparrow all but forces Queen Margery to get into bed with the king , saying , " You have a duty , your grace . Congress does not require desire on the woman 's part , only patience . " <p> Echoing Jaime 's charge to the High Sparrow that Cercei only had to make her walk of shame because she was a woman , the Faith seems implicitly set on punishing and controlling women ; meanwhile the Faith of the Lord of Light seems intent on burning and murdering all those who do n't subscribe to its precepts . The most obvious avenue to escaping the cycle of violence religion , that is is itself besmirched with murder , desecration , and subjugation . <p> Clegane 's re-appearance does confirm the theory that he will be the Faith 's champion in the Trial by Combat for Cercei 's soul ; he will be facing off against the reanimated Mountain because , of course , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ god of Drama , and what could be better than a good ol ' smash-up between the two Clegane brothers , both resurrected in his own way ? <p> Meanwhile , the forces of the north are trying to establish an army to challenge the Boltons at Winterfell . ( The 10-year-old running House Mormont was the obvious highlight of this episode . ) They have assembled the Wildlings ( or Free Folk ) as well as some other minor houses , but it is still an uphill battle . And , across the Narrow Sea , Arya has been repeatedly gutted by a Waif in a borrowed face . <p> The title of " The Broken Man " refers , ultimately , not to any single character but to an entire world , beaten and tortured and mutilated and shattered , left decimated and violated by war , rape , and torture . The elements that might deliver us out of this cycle of violence namely , belief in a higher power , like the Seven or the Lord of Light are themselves merely banners . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their words and their symbols .

 Trump 's Rhetoric Reminds Me of Nazi Race Laws <p> MSNBC host Joe Scarborough continued his attacks on Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump 's rhetoric towards a Mexican-American judge Monday morning , saying that it reminded him of the Nazi racial codes under Adolf Hitler . <p> Republican Arizona Senator Jeff Flake was very critical of Trump 's comments , saying that he could not yet endorse his party 's presumptive nominee . " His statements this week on the judge , that 's a new level , " he said . " It 's not just ill-informed , ignorant statements , but they suggest that when he 's president after November that perhaps he ought to go after that judge . " <p> " And also a guy who was born in America , a guy from Midwest like Paul Ryan , born in Indiana , " Scarborough pointed out . " He 's not even looking at his citizenship , he 's not even looking at his place of birth . " <p> " I mean , this sounds like Nuremberg , " Scarborough said . " ' Are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? ' ' Are you 1/8th Mexican ? ' I mean , what standard is this ? This is not American . " <p> The Nuremberg racial codes were implemented at the height of the Nazi regime to determine who exactly was undesirable and subject to persecution .

 Paid Hundreds of Workers for Services , Report Says <p> A new report today finds that hundreds of workers have issues with Donald Trump just not paying them what they were owed . <p> According to USA Today , a whole chunk of the lawsuits Trump has gotten into over the years involves a wide variety of workers ( i.e. glass-makers , waiters , bartenders , real estate brokers , and law firms ) have said Trump has failed to pay them , and that there have been lots of liens filed against Trump by people who have worked on his properties over the years demanding compensation . <p> Trump has been successful in a number of those lawsuits , but one cabinet builder says his business suffered after Trump did n't pay up : <p> Edward 's son , Paul , who was the firm 's accountant , still remembers the amount of that bill more than 30 years later : . The reason : the money never came . " That began the demise of the Edward J.

If a company or worker he hires is n't paid fully , the Trumps said , it 's because The Trump Organization was unhappy with the work . <p> " Let 's say that they do a job that 's not good , or a job that they did n't finish , or a job that was way late .

" <p> Her speech started feeling more like a comedy roast when she went after Trump for his racially-charged attacks on the judge , calling him a " thin-skinned racist bully .

 report from YouTube news channel , Google appears to be purging its autocomplete suggestions of terms that would be embarrassing for Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton . <p> " Thanks to our editor , Spencer Reed , Sourcefed has discovered that Google has been actively altering search recommendations in favor of Hillary Clinton 's campaign , so quietly that we were unable to see it for what it was until today , " said host Matt Lieberman in a video announcing their discovery . <p> The video , which has received 10 million views on Facebook , certainly sound conspiratorial , but the evidence is surprisingly sound . SourceFed fed the same terms into Google , Bing , and Yahoo to see what the search engines ' autocomplete would recommend . Yahoo and Bing had the same results ; entering a phrase like " Hillary Clinton cri " turned up suggestions like " Hillary Clinton criminal , " " Hillary Clinton criminal charges , " and " Hillary Clinton crimes . " <p> The trend held up across all the terms they tried . " Hillary Clinton ind " on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Hillary Clinton indictment , " but Google offers terms like " Hillary Clinton Indiana " and " Hillary Clinton India . " The same thing does n't seem to happen for damaging terms like " Donald Trump racist " or " Bernie Sanders socialist " . <p> SourceFed did n't just compare the separate search engines , they also used Google Trends to figure out which terms were actually the most searched for . Surprise , surprise : " Hillary Clinton indictment " was searched for eight times more often than " Hillary Clinton India . " Despite " Hillary Clinton crime reform " being Google 's top suggested search term , so few people search for it that it does n't even show up on Google Trends . <p> We at Mediaite decided to give it a try with a few other politicians . Searching for " Bill Clinton white " brings up the same results across all search engines , usually items about his White House . But add only one more letter , and Google 's autocomplete gives up entirely . <p> Likewise , Google autocomplete @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Senator Ted Kennedy . <p> The Wall Street Journal 's Tim Hanrahan also points out that when you put in " Bill Clinton aff , " the site assumes you must be looking for information about his views on affordable health care . <p> Contrary to SourceFed , we did find that Google will sanitize certain searches for Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders . " Bernie Sanders com , " brings up recommendations for his " commercials " and " commitments " on Google , while Bing and Yahoo 's recommendations are all variations of " Bernie Sanders communist . " Google also stops recommending searches after " Donald Trump bigo , " while the other sites recommend variations on " Donald Trump bigot . " <p> UPDATE ( 1:43 PM ) : Google has responded to the allegations put forward in the SourceFed video . <p> " Google Autocomplete does not favor any candidate or cause . Claims to the contrary simply misunderstand how Autocomplete works .

 of Policy Specifics : ' My Voters Do n't Care ' <p> Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump dismissed concerns about his lack of policy specifics in an interview with Time magazine , saying that his voters just did n't care . <p> Trump began by mocking Hillary Clinton for her campaign 's high level of organization . " Hillary 's campaign is crazy , " he said . " I look at her staffing , and I mean she 's got the United States government there . " <p> " She 's got people that sit in cubicles writing policy all day . Nothing 's ever going to happen .

His ex-wife , who spoke anonymously to The Washington Post , said that at first , he " seemed like a normal human being " and " was a very private person .

 Shooter Hosted Strange , Anti-American YouTube Show <p> The father of Omar Mateen , the mass shooter who killed 50 people in an Orlando nightclub , hosted a bizarre YouTube talk show . The Associated Press reported that a former Afghan officer said that the show was filled with " anti-US tirades . " In one episode , he even professes to hold allegiance to the Taliban . <p> Seddique Mateen posted dozens of episodes of the show , which was called " The Durand Jirga Show . " Most of the videos have less than 200 views . The shows are obviously very low budget . Mateen speaks mostly in the Dari language . Bizarrely , in one of the episodes , he announces his candidacy for the presidency of Afghanistan ( a year after the elections had already occurred ) . <p> " Our brothers in Waziristan , our warrior brothers in the Taliban movement and national Afghan Taliban are rising the Durand Line issue will be solved soon , " the father said in one of the videos , according to a Washington Post translation . Even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mateen posted a video on his Facebook page which is called the Provisional Government of Afghanistan . <p> The videos seem to take a different tone from the statement he released following the mass shooting on Sunday .

 is Arya Stark of Winterfell , and I 'm going home , " Arya tells Jaqen before finally walking out of the House of Black and White and quitting the world 's worst unpaid internship . Despite their unique abilities and arcane , pontifical ethos , the Faceless Men are ultimately mere tools , servants of the Many-Faced God , and hired hands for the clients who pay for their services . Arya is none of these things . Like every major character in the show , she is motivated by an agenda that does not allow herself to be converted into someone else 's instrument . <p> It does n't matter if you 're a band of dispossessed zealots like the Sparrows or the Brotherhood Without Banners , a lifelong warrior like Jaime or Brienne , or a child of privilege belatedly locating your backbone like Sansa or Tyrion . Everyone is animated by something larger than themselves : belief in several or singular gods , fealty to a lord or lady , or the desire to protect and avenge your family . <p> The only thing that matters is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something larger " will itself on the world ? Anonymity can be a comfort , but it 's also a liability . If you 're truly " no one , " chances are there 's a " someone " out there prepared to enlist you to kill and be killed for reasons that ultimately mean nothing to you . <p> " All of us have to believe that we 're decent , do n't we ? " a captive Edmure Tully asks Jaime . And the answer is , no , not really . As we learned last week when Brother Ray and his humble little band of sept-builders got themselves massacred , decency for decency 's sake is basically a death sentence . <p> " You do n't matter to me , Lord Edmure , " Jaime says calmly . " Your son does n't matter do me . The people in the castle do n't matter to me . Only Cercei . And if I have to slaughter every Tully who ever lived to get back to her , that 's what I 'll do . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within the confines of one 's family , or religion , or particular desires . And so to answer your impudent question , Lord Edmure , " How do you sleep at night ? " You do it , knowing that you did whatever it took for you and yours . Which is how Edmure finds himself ordering Riverrun to surrender to the Lannisters , selling his kinsman the Blackfish up the river . <p> A somewhat reformed Sandor Clegane articulated the central theme of " No One , " when he told Thoros of Myr , " Lots of horrible shit in this world gets done for something larger than ourselves . " <p> Or as Jaime glosses it , " The things we do for love , " recalling the last thing he said before pushing Brandon Stark out of a tower to close out the show 's premiere episode merely the first instance of " horrible shit " going down in Game of Thrones because " something larger " came up . <p> People do unspeakable things in the name of family , loved ones , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ causes , even something as nebulous as " the greater good " or ominous as " the winds in the North . " Westeros is teeming with multitudes of lowborn folk who would not , as Jaime puts it , like to " die for someone else 's home . " But they 're , in effect , " no ones . " So die they do , by the thousand and the ten-thousand , in long , costly , bloody , brutal wars that traced to their root causes almost always began with the things that higher-born people did " for love . " <p> Arya made the right call . It 's better to be " someone . " <p> And then there 's Brienne and Jaime , whose touching reunion and subsequent silent , somber parting , formed a kind of counterpoint to the pitiless machinations with Edmure . If his conversation with Lord Tully evoked all the horrible things about Jaime namely , his ruthless , murderous devotion to his sister his scenes with Brienne remind us that she is the only person who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and honor underneath all that gold and swagger . She watched him break ranks with his family to rescue her from a bear , and she alone knows that he broke his oath to protect the king in order to save a city . ( Asked how many people 's lives he had rescued , Jaime once told Qyburn : " Half a million , the population of Kings Landing . " ) <p> And yet -- according to a tangled lattice of house loyalties if it comes to it , these two will be honor-bound to fight each other . It 's a fight I expect we will see on the show someday soon , but apparently not today . <p> Meanwhile , the Hound was enjoying a reunion with Thoros of Myr and Beric Dondarrion that was far more amicable than their last encounter in season 3 . After breaking bread and tag-teaming some executions with them , the three got down to the portentous business of destiny and those disquieting rumblings coming from north of the wall . Should the Hound decide to join the BwB @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against the Walkers , he would probably prove a potent ally , Valyrian sword or no . <p> Meanwhile , in the nation 's capital , they have no time for dire existential threats posed by the looming winter and the Night King ; petty power plays are still the order of the day in Kings Landing . <p> Despite being king , Tommen has been a puppet his entire adult life . His own libido made him putty in Margery 's hands , his ignorance of governmental affairs made him briefly Tywin 's pawn , and like all the Lannisters -- Cercei has exercised a formidable pull over him . And now , drunk on the platitudes of the His Holiness the High Septon ( awfully puffed-up moniker for such a conspicuously humble fellow ) and possessed with a righteous purpose he has never known in his life , Tommen has all but sealed his mother 's fate , by outlawing trial by combat and taking her personal Terminator , the reanimated Gregor Clegane , out of play . <p> Between the Hound 's rendezvous with the BwB @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does seem unlikely we 're going to get the CleganeBowl resolution to Cercei 's legal trouble <p> Of course that was n't the only theory that had some water splashed on it this week . Some of the trippier Fight Club-inspired notions about Arya and the Waif came to a bloody , satisfying fizzle when Arya dropped her nameless tormenter 's face on the wall . For all the rapaciously speculative mind-bending fan theories out there , Thrones tends to deliver fairly straightforward results that play according to conventional rules of drama . ( See , for example , Jon 's resurrection occurring in pretty much the most expected manner possible . ) <p> So if a girl ( Arya ) and a girl ( Waif ) face off in Episode 1 , expect a dramatic showdown in Episode 8 . Their chase through Braavosi back alleys , a marketplace , and a sauna was an elegantly staged and suavely executed sequence . And perhaps a tip of the hat is finally owed to the tremendous physical performances Maisie Williams and Faye Marsay ( who portrayed the Waif ) who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Offhand I ca n't think of any other actors in the show , for whom the majority of their time onscreen seems to be primarily eaten up by endless , brutal fight choreography . <p> Of course , Daenarys made a triumphant return to Meereen , borne on the back of Drogon ( who can breathe fire , sure , but his real magic power seems to be a capacity for making dramatic entrances ) . It looks like she 's about to leave Essos smoldering in dragon breath and get to the long-postponed business of sacking Westeros , but the Seven Kingdoms might not even last long enough to be destroyed by fire . <p> With a craven Tommen delivering his country into the hands of regressive fanatics , and three distinct civil wars playing themselves out in three separate kingdoms , it seems like the nation may be well on its way to rotting away into chaos and deprivation all on its own . Recall that the Crown is " half a kingdom in debt " to the Lannisters , themselves in arrears to the Iron Bank in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as exciting as ice-zombies or dragons , but if you want to ruin a country , they will get the job done . <p> As an episode like " No One " plainly illustrates , the most destructive forces in this show do n't come from foreign shores , they come from within . <p> <p> Odds &amp; Ends <p> Qyburn seems to have located Tyrion , but I think Cercei has bigger fish to fry than her fratricidal brother on the other side of the world . Then again , she has a way of getting out of even the tightest corners and no matter how busy she is , she always seems to be able to devote time and resources to plotting Tyrion 's death . <p> The next episode , entitled " Battle of the Bastards , " will see Jon Snow and the Free Folk facing off against Ramsay Bolton . So far , the penultimate episode of every even-numbered season has been entirely focussed on a single large-scale battle . See Season 2 's " Blackwater " and Season 4 's " The Watchers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tradition , we could expect another episode-long skirmish , which would mean only one episode remaining , the finale , to resolve the show 's other threads : Sam and Gilly , Brandon and Meera , Varys ' secret mission , the resurgence of the slavers , Theon and Yara , that Dorne nonsense , and , uh maybe , Jon 's parents ? <p> Tyrion 's joke , cut short by the maritime invasion of the masters , begins : " I once walked into a brothel with a honeycomb and a jackass .

 , a gunman who had pledged his loyalty to ISIS killed 49 people in an Orlando nightclub . By the time the day was through , prominent politicians and journalists took to the airwaves and reacted by calling for banning a gun that did n't exist , banning guns that are already banned , and spreading laughably false information . <p> Legendary journalist Tom Brokaw got things rolling on NBC 's Meet the Press by calling for a ban on AR-14 rifles , if it turned out the shooter used one in the attack . <p> Please enable Javascript to watch . <p> But let 's say it 's a domestic shooting . We 've got to do something about that . You know , I 'm a gun owner , I 've been saying this for months now . It 's time for people to come together and say , " Enough . " If he had an assault weapon , if it was an AR-14 , Stan McChrystal has said not to be in civilian hands . It 's designed to do one thing , to kill people . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an AR-14 , given that the AR-14 is not a gun that exists . <p> Brokaw is of course thinking of the AR-15 , the single most popular rifle in America . It 's a small error but a telling one , and an odd one for a gun owner to make . It 'd be rather like someone claiming to be a gamer and then ranting about the deficiencies of the Nintendo 54 . <p> He was then one-upped later in the program by Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders . <p> Please enable Javascript to watch . <p> Oh , it 's horrific , it 's unthinkable . And just hopes go out to all those who were shot that they can recover . And I 've got to tell you , 25 years ago , I believe that in this country , we should not be selling automatic weapons which are designed to kill people . We have got to do everything that we can on top of that to make sure that guns do not fall into the hands of people who should not have them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ struggles continues . <p> Sanders was n't alone in calling for a ban on automatic weapons . He was joined by celebrities Seth McFarlane and Susan Sarandon . <p> These shootings are a regular occurrence . You do n't get to be " shocked " anymore unless you take action to stop them . Ban automatic weapons . <p> Sanders and friends make a common mistake here , conflating " assault weapon " with " automatic weapon " ( an easy mistake , considering " assault weapon " is an invented political term used exclusively by politicians and activists ) . It 's semi-automatic weapons like the AR-15 that are legal , but they require the user to manually pull the trigger every time they want to fire a shot . It 's possible Sanders meant to say that he wants to ban all semi-auto weapons , but that would include virtually all non-revolver handguns on the market and would be an unpopular proposal even among most Democrats . <p> Last and certainly least came Florida Democratic Representative Alan Grayson with a shocking fact about the AR-15 . " If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not able to buy a weapon that shoots off 700 rounds in a minute , a lot of those people would still be alive , " he said solemnly on CNN . <p> Please enable Javascript to watch . <p> Just ... no . Absolutely not . <p> This is a common assertion from those who , again , have only a limited knowledge of guns and misunderstand common terms . The cyclic rate of fire from an AR-15 is indeed around 700 rounds a minute , but that 's just how quickly the mechanics of the gun move the next bullet into place and allow it to be fired . Again , semi-automatic guns still require you to pull the trigger with each shot . <p> One conservative on Twitter offered Grayson if he could fire an AR-15 700 times a minute , but do n't expect him to collect . You would need to pull the trigger more than ten times a second just to fire off that many shots . And that 's assuming you have a magical , non-existent magazine rather than the standard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ activists who actually know their facts and understand the complicated issues that underlie the debate . But all too often , outspoken activists seem to not understand the very weapons they are so certain must be banned .@@9341698 <h> Hundreds on hand 
 massacre of 49 patrons at an Orlando gay bar in the early hours of yesterday morning , we 've been doing a lot of talking about religion . The shooter 's religion , in particular , has been brought up , given his self-proclaimed ties to the Islamic State . The shooter 's imam was even interviewed . Conversely , Christianity has been brought up , as well , especially as ardently Christian politicians who have voted against the best interests of the LGBT community have issued vaguely-worded condemnations of the attack while leaving out the fact that it targeted a gay bar . <p> In short , religious ideologies and the differences between them get people heated up very quickly . Now , the following video may get you heated up very quickly , because it shows a Christian pastor outlining " the good news and the bad news " about the massacre . <p> Spoiler alert : the " good news " is that " sodomites , " " pedophiles , " and " disgusting perverts " died . <p> It almost feels senseless to give this man , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ addressing his diatribe , but more importantly , it should serve as a reminder of the type of radical ideology that allows and encourages the mistreatment ( and murder ) of LGBT people . That ideology is not limited to Islam . <p> I wo n't transcribe parts of the video ; you can watch what is available if you want to . What I will do is tell you that in an itty bitty act of Internet justice , 5,725 of the clip 's 111,111 viewers downvoted it . Only 568 have upvoted it . Eventually , those downvotes got the attention of YouTube , which took the entire thing down for violating their policy on hate speech . <p> Luckily , the Internet being the Internet , some people had already ripped it and added their own commentary to it .

 's the ubiquitous Omar Mateen ( the first and last time his name will be mentioned here ) who has easily been getting the most airtime over 48 hours of blanket coverage after a horrific event that left 49 dead and more than 50 injured at an Orlando nightclub . It 's a Facebook and Twitter world now , so plenty of photos of the terrorist some of the variety are being featured everywhere via network , cable and online news , plus obviously social media . <p> For ISIS , a sophisticated ( for lack of a better word ) propaganda machine that builds its aura and reach to the more through social media than any its caliphate can overtake in Syria and Iraq , it could n't draw up this scenario any better . The American media 's primary focus on the shooter specifically from a visual perspective via the aforementioned photos is as stunning as it irresponsible , as it does nothing but provide a boatload of PR and recruitment power for ISIS at no cost . <p> The call for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this space . I wrote it after Newtown and did the same after Oregon : Is there really a need to show personal photos of the gunman in these situations or even say his name ? In the case of Orlando , the shooter/terrorist has one particular selfie that is especially nauseating ( below ) . Do we really need to see this in an attempt to help " understand " his demented psyche or explore his background ? <p> It 's not unlike the stunt Rolling Stone pulled with the surviving Tsarnaev brother ( Dzhokhar ) , turning him into a 21st Century ( young ) Bob Dylan in the process . And this thought process of glorifying evil people just does n't apply to terrorists ... simply look no further than the all the attention O.J. Simpson still gets more than 20 years later via mini-series after mini-series for basically decapitating his wife while also stabbing Ron Goldman to death in the process . And we as an audience , as consumers , eat it all up . <p> Per my October column following the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , including the shooter who committed suicide as police closed in : <p> It ( not using names or photos of mass shooters ) is largely a symbolic act , of course , as it takes all of two seconds to find that information online or on social media . And even if every on-air anchor or host did n't share names or faces in these situations , those who want that information and/or visual can and will find it . <p> But is that really the point ? Because perhaps if the heads of every major broadcast news organization got together and decided that the policy should be universal across ABC , NBC , CBS , Fox and CNN , that would pressure others to do the same . Not all will be on board , of course , and there is the unfortunate business end of this as well , but it 's worth a shot . Critics will counter that withholding this kind of information ( name , photo , etc. ) amounts to censorship . But the question is : If an outlet still shares @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and photo , is that still censorship ? <p> And look , nobody is saying this act puts an end to mass shootings in this country . But it 's impossible to ignore this joint study from Arizona State University and Northeastern Illinois University that finds " 20 to 30 percent of attacks are set off by other attacks . " <p> There is a group with growing support that is pressuring the media on Twitter and Facebook called ( and ) . The group was started by Caren and Tom Teves who lost their son and daughter Alex and Jessica after the Aurora , Colorado movie theater mass shootings . Here 's their message this morning ... one that is impossible to argue against : <p> Unfortunately , the media landscape is far too competitive , far too gone in terms of sensationalism , to ever apply logic , responsibility and common sense in not providing those like the Orlando terrorist the notoriety he sought here . The face will remain everywhere for days and weeks to come . <p> And in the end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ receives as a result ... and barely lifts a finger in the process . <h> Share Update : 
 Tapper wondered Tuesday whether President Barack Obama 's White House speech denouncing Donald Trump 's rhetoric on Islam signaled that he was not confident that Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton was up to the job . <p> " Let me also make one observation , which is obviously President Obama is very eager to get into this political debate and he 's very eager to defend himself , but also to do what he can to stop Donald Trump from becoming president , " Tapper began . <p> Please enable Javascript to watch . <p> " I ca n't help but observe that if he thought Hillary Clinton was doing a good job or an effective job making the case against Trump , maybe he would n't go to the East Room and make it himself , " he argued . <p> " So in a way , while this is completely a condemnation of Trump and everything Trump stands for , I would n't say that President Obama entering the presidential race this way exactly expresses a huge vote of confidence in the way that Hillary Clinton is rebutting Trump @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made , " he concluded . <p> The indie comedy

He continued , " I want to know who were the soldiers that had that job , ' cause I think they 're living well right now , whoever they may be . " <p> Now , it was famously reported back then that a lot of the money meant for Iraq reconstruction went missing and a lot of it got misspent , but Trump is making the specific accusation that U.S. soldiers took that money and are now " living well " off it . <p> Please enable Javascript to watch . <p> And in case there 's any lingering doubts as to what he could have meant there , behold this Guardian report on something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggested that some American soldiers charged with distributing money to fund the Afghan and Iraqi government embezzled it instead .

" <p> Yes , Trump seemed to make the case that he would be kinder to the press when he is leader of the free world ... when the media would no doubt be tougher on him . ( And then there was the fact he specifically threatened to loosen the libel laws as president . ) <p> Trump insisted all he wants is fair treatment from the press , saying , " By the way , if I have a bad story , that 's okay , if it 's true . If i deserve it . You know , I 'll deserve bad stories on occasion . " He did not give specific examples of such . <p> What we do know is exactly where he draws the line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they write lies ; when they write stories that have no bearing on the truth ; when they say things that are so wrong , and they know they 're wrong , and they tell me that they know they 're wrong , but they refuse to change them , then I say , they 're not going to come anymore .

 Donald Trump has been that President Obama is a secret Muslim who sympathizes with Islamic extremists like the Orlando nightclub shooter ? Well , he 's pushing a story saying that the president has provided aid to the predecessors of ISIS . <p> The presumptive nominee took to Twitter again this morning , where he shared this story from Breitbart 's Patrick Howley . <p> The story reads that the State Department under Hillary Clinton received a " secret memo " from a Defense Intelligence agent who said that Obama provided support to al-Qaeda 's Iraqi branch that eventually splintered off to become ISIS . <p> " The report identifies Al Qaeda in Iraq ( AQI ) as being one of the principal elements of the Syrian opposition , which the West was choosing to ' support , ' " the report reads .

 Muslims to be in his show when he lectures on " what Islam is really about " is like having a discussion on Black Lives Matter with only a panel of white people . True , we see that very thing happen on Fox News , but Maher keeps telling us he 's a liberal . Well , would n't a liberal invite a Muslim who disagrees with him on the show when having such a conversation ? <p> On Maher 's show Friday , he told America that Muslims are not countering the threat of radicalization enough , declaring , " We need to ask more of Muslims . " Well what a great place for a Muslim American activist to explain to Bill and the audience exactly what our community has been doing . And to make it clear that no one wants to stop Muslims from committing acts of terror more than fellow Muslim Ameircans for a few reasons . The first is because we do n't want to see innocent people killed in the name of our faith it 's morally reprehensible . Plus we are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attack , as we are seeing now after Orlando with shots being fired at a mosque , a Muslim man being punched in New York City , women in hijabs being threatened and more . <p> And if Maher had on a Muslim who is actually a part of the Muslim American community- as opposed to a Muslim who has no following and is more about selling books- he would have learned that Muslims have turned in suspected terrorists and are working with law enforcement . <p> The reality is Maher at one time did invite a spectrum of Muslim voices on his show . Maher welcomed people like Congressman Keith Ellison , the first Muslim elected to the U.S. Congress , author Reza Aslan , journalist Rula and others . <p> But Reza and Rula have n't been back on the show since they challenged Maher 's views on Islam a few years ago after his famous blow up with Ben Affleck . And to my knowledge , no one else from the Muslim American community has been invited on the show unless they are on Maher 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appears Maher does n't want Muslims on his show that will talk back to him . Or could it be that Maher simply does n't know any other Muslim Ameircans ? Maybe that 's it- Maher needs more Muslim friends . <p> On my weekly SiriusXM radio show ( which will be expanded this week from once a week to live Monday to Friday at Noon ET on Ch. and yes , that was a shameless plug ) I open each program by saying , " I want to be your Muslim friend . " Now given my history with Maher , I doubt he wants me on his show . ( Last year , Maher mocked me on his show for my Daily Beast article defending Ahmed Mohammed , the teenager who made a clock . Plus I have written countless articles for CNN and The Daily Beast very critical of Maher . ) <p> But I can promise you this is not about me getting on Maher 's show it 's about having a person from the Muslim American community who can , and will , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our faith and community . <p> So here are a few Muslim Americans I have had on my radio show in the past that Maher might like to be friends with and invite on the show . ( The order below is random , not a ranking . ) <p> 1 . Congressman Andre Carson ( D-Ind. ) The second Muslim member of Congress and a great progressive voice . <p> 2 . Linda a leader in the Muslim American community in New York City and a tireless fighter against racism , sexism and bigotry . <p> 3 . Maysoon a comedian and activist who is co-founder of the Muslim Funny Fest and New York Arab American Comedy Festival . <p> 5 . Suhail Khan a Republican Muslim ( yes , they exist ) who served in the Bush administration . <p> 6 .

I 'm happy to share their contact info if Maher 's producers are interested . <p> But now it 's up to Bill : Is he content simply playing a liberal on TV or will actually be one and invite Muslims who do n't agree with on his show ?

 published in the Washington Post Thursday , Michael Farris , one of the earliest members of the Moral Majority movement , which sought to infuse Christian values into the Republican platform , condemned Donald Trump and the evangelicals who have flocked to support him . <p> The Moral Majority was established in 1979 by Baptist minister and segregationist Jerry Falwell , and Farris , currently chancellor of the evangelical Patrick Henry College in Virginia , attended the first meeting in 1980 . <p> Trump 's " candidacy is the antithesis of everything we set out to achieve , " he writes . Falwell taught his followers that " believing Christians were not to be silent , nor the tools of any political party . " <p> " We are conservative , yes . And yes , the Republican Party has been the home of political conservatives , " Farris writes . " But we were to stand for principle . We wanted leaders who were closely aligned with a biblical worldview on the issues of the day , and we also wanted leaders of good moral character .

Ultimately , Bash still concluded that if there is a " headline , " it 's all about Hillary Clinton and that even if Gowdy wo n't admit it , he and his committee spent $7 million in tax-payer dollars to investigate her and find " no smoking gun . " Still , she said it is hard to " pin it down into one or two sentences . " <p> " I can pin it down into this sentence , " offered Banfield.

 Wiesel , Author of Night , Dies at 87 <p> One of the foremost voices and educators about the horrors of the Holocaust passed away Saturday at the age of 87 . <p> Elie Wiesel , who was born in Romania before being forcibly deported to Auschwitz , later authored the book Night and became one of the most recognized and decorated writers of the 20th century . <p> Night is a frequently-read text in American school classrooms , and details Wiesel 's time at the concentration camp beginning in 1944 . Wiesel famously had the number " A-7713 " tattooed on his left arm , an insignia that he wrote was given to him within days of arriving at Auschwitz as a 15-year-old . According to the US holocaust Museum , 1.1 million people died at Auschwitz between 1940 and 1945 . <p> Wiesel was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1986 , and received the Dayton Literary Peace Prize 's Lifetime Achievement Award in 2007 ; in 2009 he toured Buchenwald concentration camp alongside German chancellor Angela Merkel and President Barack Obama , the site where Wiesel 's father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , one of the more striking moments came as Wiesel chillingly recounted his time at Auschwitz : <p> Then came the march past the victims .

 Turned the USA Into the Divided States of America <p> The Fourth of July is the one day each year when Americans specifically celebrate our nation . Sadly , this holiday is not as unifying as it once was . After all , it 's not nearly as politically correct to honor old , white , males ( some of whom were ) slave-owners these days , and many of our founding principles seem to have been reduced to mere suggestions . <p> However , Independence Day still generally passes as one of those increasingly rare happenings which most of our citizens share as a communal event , often even literally at community fireworks displays . Given how infrequent these types of occasions are in modern America , it seems to me that the Fourth of July is the exception which proves the rule of this seemingly dangerously divided nation . <p> In today 's America , we share , in any meaningful sense , frighteningly few moments together . I believe this is a large part of why our politics are so maddeningly deadlocked . If you think of America @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while we often disagreed about its meaning , we at least seemed ( pretended ? ) to all accept what the words and the page numbers are . <p> Today , it appears that we have divided ourselves into ever-shrinking tribes isolated by our own truths which are encased in the bubble of our own self-serving realities . We are largely no longer the USA , but rather the Divided States of America . <p> As usual , I blame the media . <p> Ironically , it was n't that long ago that the media was the most unifying force that our country had . It seems hard to believe in today 's extraordinarily fragmented media world , but there are still lots of people alive who would routinely once gather in public places to listen to presidential speeches and sporting events ... on the radio . <p> Starting in the 1960s , and specifically with the Kennedy Assassination , television became an even more powerful force for creating communal events . The Beatles became a sensation with just a single appearance on the Ed Sullivan Show . The moon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American 's consciousness . <p> In the 1970s , television in a four-channel universe became such a dominant presence that to this day secondary stars of middling comedy shows are still considered to be legitimate celebrities . I often kid my friend Franco Harris ( NFL Hall of Famer ) that if his still-famous " Immaculate Reception " happened today it would be forgotten in a week or two . <p> The Watergate hearings ( even at the very preliminary Senate committee level ) were carried live on nearly every television channel . When Bill Clinton was actually impeached a quarter-century later , the trial was jettisoned largely to cable news channels and was seen by a far smaller audience . The fact that Richard Nixon resigned before even getting impeached , while Clinton survived and is seemingly about to have his wife elected president is , in my opinion , a direct result of this fundamental alteration of the media landscape . <p> In the cable era , television audiences fragmented into a 500-channel ( or more ) universe . The advent of the Internet further splintered the dissemination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very same media which used to unify us ( at least with regard to communal experiences and a commonality of basic information ) , is now the force which most actively divides our country . As someone who lives in the Los Angeles market , where about half the radio and television stations do not even broadcast in English , I can personally attest to how dramatic this change has been . <p> Today , " Broadcasting " ( other than the Super Bowl ) no longer exists . It has been replaced by " Narrowcasting , " in which outlets are cynically designed to appeal to nothing but a tiny sliver of demographic for the purposes of maximizing advertising efficiency . This is destructive enough in the fantasy world of entertainment ( no current TV show could even remotely claim to be well-known to a majority of Americans ) , but this has been absolutely catastrophic in the realm of news . <p> Almost all of our news outlets now can be easily identified as having a particular , and often very narrow , political bent and they act @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sellable demographic which will keep them afloat ( see Breitbart.com &amp; Donald Trump ) . This means that most " news " organizations are only interested in stories and truths that their audience will want to hear . Quite simply , nothing could be more antithetical to both the pursuit of truth ( which is quite often very UN-popular ) as well as the maintenance of a country which has enough " knowledge " in common so as to be able to function as remotely unified society . <p> Taking this concept out of the theoretical and placing it into the practical , this is exactly why we saw such deeply divergent opinions among the races regarding the very simple O.J. Simpson murder case ( as well as numerous other similar " racial " episodes which have followed ) and are currently seeing a civil war among conservatives about the equally clear-cut candidacy of Donald Trump . Each different demographic slice of the American Pie is now simply living in totally separate worlds with completely different realities . <p> Most of those who get their news only from Fox News @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Breitbart.com think that Donald Trump is a savior who is certain to win and that Hillary Clinton is the anti-Christ . Almost everyone who only consumes the New York Times , Washington Post , MSNBC , CNN , NPR &amp; the Huffington Post are sure the opposite is true . President Obama 's approval rating is split about 50/50 , but , isolated in our own information bubble , almost everyone is positive their view of him is 100% correct . Regardless of your politics , this phenomenon is a cancer on our country . <p> The worst part of this conundrum is that there is seemingly no way to fix it . In fact , unless television and internet outlets start going out of business at an impressive rate ( which is possible ) , it will likely only get worse . My only immediate suggestions are that we at least become fully aware of this incredibly corrosive force on our national integration , and that we enjoy days like today when most of us are still celebrating the United States of America in a fashion that is at @ @ @ @ <h> Man accused of

 former President Bill Clinton 's impromptu tarmac meeting with Attorney General Loretta Lynch continues unabated , given fresh life by the news that former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was interviewed by the FBI over the weekend . On Tuesday 's edition of Morning Joe , Washington Post columnist and Hillary Clinton supporter Jonathan Capehart continued the flagellation by calling the meeting a " disaster of epic proportions " while dissecting his various and sundry interviews with AG Lynch on the subject of that meeting . <p> Capehart told dour MJ concern troll Mika Brzezinski that AG Lynch wanted to accomplish two things : to explain how the process works , and to emphasize how the process works : <p> Please enable Javascript to watch . <p> One , she 's trying to explain how this process works , because she knows that this was and remains a disaster of epic proportions when it comes to the independence and integrity of the Justice Department .

Most objective observers consider it " poor optics , " nothing more . I do n't think even Donald Trump has gone to DefCon " Epic Disaster . " <p> That 's an awful lot of trouble to go through just to avoid getting yelled at by Mika Brzezinski , but Capehart 's over-the-top reaction raises a similar question to the one he asked AG Lynch this weekend : What was everyone thinking when they decided that Lynch 's first interview following that meeting should be conducted by an openly pro-Hillary columnist ? No matter how good the questions or the answers , their impact is blunted by that fact , and now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ credibility , instead of doing what he ought to be doing : holding the " objective media " to account for using the " bad optics " crutch in order to avoid talking about the substance of this story . <p> That bit of shorthand is an implicit admission that the concerns raised by your Brzezinskis and your Andrea Mitchells are superficial crap , and are , by definition , without substance .

 at MSNBC 's Morning Joe continued to deliver the top-notch political analysis we 've come to expect when , on Thursday morning , they all agreed that presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump " got his groove back " during two speeches this week , while acknowledging that those speeches continued to contain defenses of Trump 's anti-Semitic star of David tweet and reiterations of his longstanding praise for Saddam Hussein . <p> This might sound absurd at first blush , but hosts Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski explained that despite those and other seemingly disastrous flaws , Trump " connected " with the audience , and recaptured the " energy " and " joy " of campaigning . Despite the anti-Semitism and praise for Saddam Hussein , panelist Mark Halperin agreed that Trump " has a sense of what it will take to win " this election . <p> Please enable Javascript to watch . <p> This is also the tale of two speeches .

 reason that no one has yet been fired over in the Trump campaign for the fact that Melania Trump read an evidently plagiarized speech Monday night at the Republican National Convention ? <p> In the minds of some , the answer is yes : because someone who can not be fired was responsible . <p> According to Morning Joe 's Mika Brzezinski , one of Trump 's five children was " probably " responsible for the flap . During a discussion about the unprecedented influence that the children in the Trump family have wielded on the campaign , it struck the Morning Joe host that perhaps there was something else that they had a hand in that no one had considered . <p> " Were one of the kids responsible for Melania 's speech ?

 Anti-Blackness of Ted Cruz 's RNC Speech <p> Everybody 's talking about Texas Senator and former Republican presidential candidate Ted Cruz 's Wednesday night speech at the Republican National Convention , but they 're talking more about what he did n't say than what he said . Cruz was booed off the stage for failing to endorse nominee Donald Trump , but not before he managed to out-Trump Trump when it comes to outright racism , and to remind liberals that there really are worse things than a Trump presidency . <p> Cruz kicked off his speech with the decision to pervert the death of a Dallas police officer into a pep talk for Republican base voters , telling the story of 9 year-old Caroline Smith 's heartbreaking last words to her father , Sergeant Michael J. Smith . But then Cruz took the extra step of slandering black people , and turning them into the villains of his story in the process : <p> I have no idea who he voted for in the last election , or what he thought about this once , but his life was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who mocked him because he loved his country , and his fellow man . <p> The Republican National Convention has n't exactly been a love letter to Black Lives Matter , but what Cruz did was to slander and demonize people who peacefully advocate for accountability for the unjust use of force against black people , and who , by all accounts , were doing so with mutual respect for the police officers who were on duty the night of the Dallas police killings . Surely Cruz knows this , as one of the key points in the reporting on the shootings was the fact that the Dallas Police Department had been posting photos of cops posing with protesters that night . Cruz just made it up , and he did so in order to make black people who do n't want to be murdered by bad cops the villains in his pep talk . <p> Cruz is right that he has no idea who the late Sgt. Smith voted for , but it 's a safe bet that no Black Lives Matter protester would have had a quarrel with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with an object in his hand , he put himself on the line instead of shooting to kill : <p> Several years ago , while working CBD , Sgt. Smith and his partner made contact with a pair of gang members which they did not know . While Sgt. Smith was searching one of the members , he noticed that the other gang member lunged at his partner with an unknown object in his hand . Sgt. Smith intervened to protect his partner and was cut with an unknown object on the head . Sgt. Smith was taken to the hospital with a large laceration . It took 31 stitches to close the wound . <p> As if all of that was n't bad enough , Cruz went on to explain why he had brought the whole thing up to begin with , and instead of coming up with some kind of thin but defensible rationale about remembering the important things in life , Cruz just came out and said that Sgt. Smith 's death was a reminder to get out the vote : <p> Maybe it 's because of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is our last time ? Our last moment to do something for our families , and our country ? Did we live up to the values we say we believe ? Did we do all we really could ? <p> I realize that there are far too many lies being told at the RNC for the media to possibly keep up , but when one of those lies is used to slander an entire race of people just for not wanting to be killed with impunity , maybe make a little bit of space on the schedule . <h> Hear Macy Gray

" he asked . <p> It had seemed pretty clear to me for a long time that Mediaite employed and featured people with a variety of perspectives , but I did go back to my desk that day and look up what people said about Mediaite . I learned that Rachel Maddow had called us a " conservative media criticism website " and that Joy us a " Fox News fan site .

 the lack of diversity in late night television , with critics typically bemoaning the lack of female comedians or hosts with minority backgrounds . However , rarely do such critics complain about the fact that literally every late night host either leans liberal or screams liberal . I might strangely be alone in thinking that some diversity in political beliefs amongst comedy talk show hosts would also be beneficial to the viewing public , but until that time arises , we have to work with what we 've got . Therefore , without further ado , let 's get to my ranking of the best and worst of the late night talk shows and hosts , from the perspective of a right-leaning viewer . <p> The rankings below are based on how each show covered the Republican National Convention . Of course , all the hosts mercilessly mocked Donald Trump and the Republican party , but what separates the great shows from the garbage ones are vastly different levels of creativity , humor , mean-spiritedness and condescension . Conan O'Brien skipped being political last week to focus on Comic-Con , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weighed in and I 've grouped them into three categories . The first tier of shows is " insightful and hilarious , " the second tier is " mindless and impartial , " and the third tier is " unwatchable and sanctimonious . " Here we go : <p> Category 1 : Insightful and Hilarious ! Must Watch Full Episode ! 1 . Real Time with Bill . Last Week Tonight with John Oliver3 . The Daily Show with Trevor Noah I may be overstating it , but Bill Maher 's show is not merely the best talk show , it 's also one of the most important , insightful and entertaining shows anywhere on television . Yes Maher thinks Trump is evil , yes he basically thinks most ( possibly all ? ) Republicans are horrible , but despite his personal beliefs , he regularly welcomes conservatives on as guests and grants them a completely fair and uncensored opportunity to argue their case . What makes this so unique is that true debates are encouraged and Maher seems genuinely interested in learning about why Republicans think the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through " the bubble " and convince them to change their mind . Most importantly , Maher is always funny and one of the rare hosts who takes legitimate comedic jabs at Hillary Clinton and others on his side , proving to be a fearless equal opportunity offender who never predictably toes his party 's line . <p> In nearly a tie for second place , both John Oliver and Trevor Noah are nicely filling the shoes left behind by Jon Stewart , who until last week I thought was sorely missed ( more on that below ) . Noah definitely started out shaky , but based on last week 's coverage of the convention alone , I 'd argue his version of the show is now severely underrated . Noah 's opening Stewart-esque monologues were really funny all week and he also featured a laugh-out-loud " documentary " about Trump 's life story narrated by Rosie O'Donnell . Meanwhile Oliver is killing it with his format-defining show , and just last night probably had the best , most thought-provoking takedown of Trump I 've heard from anyone , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ campaign is basically based entirely on feelings and with a disregard for facts . <p> Yet despite such stinging attacks from Maher , Oliver and Noah towards Republicans , these three hosts launch the assault with such charm , wit and smiles that for me at least , even if I do n't agree with them , I thoroughly enjoy their presentation . <p> Category 2 : Mindless and Impartial !

In covering the GOP convention , Fallon unleashed his spot-on and very funny Trump impression , Kimmel sent a crazy man-on-the-street reporter to the convention hall to conduct enjoyably weird interviews and Corden expertly " plagiarized " David Letterman 's Top Ten list as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fun , but without any of the insight viewers receive from Category 1 shows and without any of the hidden anger towards half of the country seeping out of Category 3 shows . <p> Among these three hosts , I personally give the slight edge to Kimmel , since he tends to be funnier ( given he does n't have the crutch of being a talented impressionist or singer ) , while Fallon 's bits tend to consistently be the most crowd pleasing . Yet Corden is fast on the rise , and in this writer 's opinion , his ascension to replace the Category 3 Stephen Colbert could n't come soon enough . <p> Category 3 : Unwatchable and Sanctimonious ! Avoid At All Costs ! 7 . The Nightly Show with Larry . The Late Show with Stephen .

And his roundtable discussion with guests is nowhere near as funny or interesting as Maher 's similar format . So ultimately Wilmore might mean well , but with the glut of shows covering the same news every day , my response to The Nightly Show is just " nah ! " <p> My real bone to pick is with the final two hosts Stephen Colbert and Seth Meyers . I 'll readily admit if you are a serious liberal Democrat , you probably disagree with my opinion here , however , for anyone else , Colbert and Meyers regularly come across as smug , know-it-alls who lecture rather than entertain . Especially last week , in covering the GOP convention , their disdain not only for Trump , but Republicans generally was on full display . At least Colbert stepped aside twice in favor of a genuine comedic bits : a perfect Melania Trump impersonator and a , occasionally funny , possibly Jon Stewart rant . Yet the most painful segments of the entire week were Meyers ' " Closer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and poorly recited bits were laugh-free , mean , and utter wastes of time . I can only remember once laughing during all of Meyers ' bits , calling Ben Carson a brain surgeon and a brain donor .

 for Hillary and Bernie at Start of Democratic Convention <p> It would seem that the harsh reception for Bernie Sanders ' call for unity was but a foreshadowing of Monday 's start to the Democratic National Convention . <p> The convention will officially establish Hillary Clinton as the the 2016 Democratic presidential nominee , though the fallout from this weekend 's WikiLeaks data dump has caused enormous friction for Democrats in Philadelphia . Rev. Cynthia Hale invoked Clinton 's name as she addressed the audience , and it seems the Sanders and Clinton factions in the crowd were dueling to have the loudest applause for their respective Democratic candidate . <p> Many in the convention audience are carrying pro-Sanders paraphernalia , and there have been multiple reported instances where they have booed or tried to shout over the speakers .

Since then , that favoritism towards liberalism has only gotten worse , and yet I am firmly convinced that this is NOT even close to the most distressing issue currently facing the industry . <p> Instead , it has been my experience that a radically altered and now business model of " journalism " has created a broken machine which can almost NEVER produce the truth and where lies now routinely rule ( it 's therefore not a coincidence that we have now ended up with two extraordinary liars for our top presidential candidates ) . Just as bad , real news has been almost completely replaced with frivolous fluff . We are now continuously being fed almost nothing but the news equivalent of cotton candy . <p> In short , the Internet has created a situation where fewer , less skilled , people have far less time to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and an overriding incentive to value the popularity of a story over its truth or importance . Modern journalism is much like if you took a winery and forced it to create product on a daily , rather than a yearly basis . Obviously you would never create any decent wine . Similarly , today 's news media almost never gets the story exactly right and often , far more than they even realize , they get it dead wrong . <p> On this week 's show Oliver nailed every aspect of this incredibly pressing problem and did so in hilarious fashion . After blistering the state of the industry in documentary style , he enlisted several name actors for a deadly spoof of the Academy Award-winning movie Spotlight , which was about the Boston Globe investigation into the Catholic Church . In it , no one supports the one lone reporter pursuing corruption at city hall because there is a hot photo that is going viral . I urge you to watch all of it . <p> The fact that Oliver , a British comedian , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the crisis in American journalism than anyone else with a major platform is probably the greatest proof of just how incredibly dire the situation really is ( it should be noted that Oliver singled-handedly did a FAR better job of vetting Donald Trump during the primaries than the entire " conservative " media ) . Ironically , of the many reasons that so few journalists have spoken out loudly about this horrific situation is that the collapse of the business model has eliminated any semblance of job security for them and thus greatly reduced their threshold for taking career risks . <p> This phenomenon is also at the very heart of why the " popularity over truth " issue is so damaging to journalism in the Internet era ( I actually once had USA Today columnist Christine Brennan write to me that she believed her reporting on a story , on which I knew her to be very wrong , was good because it had been very popular ! ) . Every time a reporter does a story which is important , but not " click bait , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going against a popular ( i.e. , usually false ) narrative on which the rest of the media has jumped , is even less common than a pack animal leaving the safety of the herd . <p> Good gigs are now so scarce that no one will do anything to even theoretically risk losing them . Making matters even worse , those with the most powerful positions have the most to lose and are therefore even MORE risk adverse , thus making the journalism at the largest media outlets even more prone to inaccuracies born of dangerous group-think . <p> For journalism and truth to have any chance of thriving , reporters must be allowed to be rewarded , or at least not punished , for stories which are inherently unpopular ( the truth is usually far less " commercial " than a nicely crafted lie ) and for taking the risk of being contrarian . Sadly , in today 's world the opposite is so obviously true that even those still pretending to be " journalists " literally do n't even consider stepping out of line . It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> So kudos to John Oliver for at least articulating the problem in a way which might give it some much-needed attention . Unfortunately ( and somewhat appropriately ) , it does n't appear that the subject is " sexy " enough for this episode to go as " viral " some of his other episodes . -- John Ziegleris a nationally-syndicated radio talk show host and documentary filmmaker .

 is essentially -- in the opinion of this writer a foregone conclusion that former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton will win the November general election . Before we continue with the absurd findings of the Public Policy Polling data out today that suggests a staggering 69% of Trump faithful think the election will be " rigged , " let 's quickly establish why I 'm so confident Trumpty Dumpty will lose yuge : <p> You do n't vote for the President , Trump fans . Remember your social studies classes ? Well , at some point you learned that it is the electoral college that decides who wins the White House , not you and your precious vote ( Aww , you thought we were a real democracy ? Cute ) . To be specific , a candidate needs 270 electoral votes ; Trump wo n't even come close . By many estimates , Clinton already has 217 safely locked up . Even Megyn Kelly last week welcomed Larry Sabato onto her show with his newest prediction for the electoral college map : a victory for the Democrat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> The Big Eleven . There are eleven key states in play for November : CO , FL , IA , MI , NV , NH , NC , OH , PA , VA , and WI . Many people are saying if you 're voting in any of the other 39 , it 's a practice in democratic futility . Sure , every vote counts , but like Animal Farm , some votes count more than others . Clinton dominates a ground game and ad spending in those states , plus is making a play at notoriously red Georgia and Arizona . If Clinton wins Florida and Virginia alone , we 're in for one helluva concession speech from Trump Tower the night of November 8th . Oh , and by the way , Barack Obama went 21-for-22 in these eleven states over the past two elections . <p> Math , Math , Math . I defer to my conservative colleague John Ziegler here to lay out all of the reasons Trump is in for a shellacking by the numbers , an inconvenient truth that Trump ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Math is hard . For some people , math is really hard , " Ziegler writes ) . Among his points : the difference between primary turnout versus the general election beast , perceptions of the man 's qualifications , and the popular vote ( in numbers ) equated when you see a statistic like " Trump is down 6% nationally " ( about 8 million people ) . <p> -69% of Trump voters think that if Hillary Clinton wins the election it will be because it was rigged , to only 16% who think it would be because she got more vote than Trump . More specifically 40% of Trump voters think that ACORN ( which has n't existed in years ) will steal the election for Clinton . That shows the long staying power of GOP conspiracy theories . <p> This is simply astounding . Trump was apparently right when he said , " I love the poorly educated ! " because all it took was for the GOP candidate to strategically float the word " rigged " around in a few interviews and go utterly and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the entire American democratic process at the federal , local , and state levels are being manipulated by the all-seeing eye . " I 'm telling you , November 8th , we 'd better be careful , because that election is going to be rigged . And I hope the Republicans are watching closely , or it 's going to be taken away from us , " he told Sean Hannity last week . <p> During the primaries when Trump was beating up on his Republican ... let 's call them " rivals , " polls were his best friend . Now that poll after poll after poll show him getting trounced , they are inconclusive falsehood narratives perpetuated by the lamestream media like dopey columnists at Mediaite . Even the damn President himself had to field a question last week from a reporter who asked the leader of the free world to confirm that the election would not be rigged ( " I do n't even really know where to start on answering this question , " he dryly replied ) . <p> Factcheck.org and Politifact have verified that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course , as the legions of Mediaite readers who double up as Trump supporters will say in the comments section below ( as well as my Twitter mentions ca n't wait ) : " those are liberal sites !

 of Working for ISIS Long Before He Got Around to It <p> After roughly a year of Hillary Clinton , Barack Obama , and countless liberal pundits and journalists solemnly declaring that Donald Trump was a de facto ISIS propagandist doing their work for them , the media suddenly decided Thursday that accusing your political opponents of working with a terrorist group is off-limits . <p> Let me begin first with a lengthy tangent : I think there has been a big misconception floating around about what Trump actually said Wednesday . A lot of reporters and commentators seem to be taking Trump 's remarks literally ; they think Trump argued that Obama and Clinton literally met with a bunch of bearded men in the Middle East and formed a terror group . <p> Reading his remarks in their full context ( which far too many media reports have lacked ) , I think it 's clear that Trump was saying Obama is " the founder of ISIS " by virtue of letting it grow in power after withdrawing troops from Iraq . <p> " Normally you want to clean up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . He made such a mess . And then you had Hillary with Libya , so sad . In fact , in many respects you know they honor President Obama . ISIS is honoring President Obama . He is the founder of ISIS . " <p> That 's still a controversial remark that ought to be scrutinized ( Trump also supported an immediate withdrawal from Iraq , for one thing ) , but when I first saw headlines on the remark , I thought he had gone full truther . This Never Trumper really does n't think that 's the case . <p> DT : I do n't care . He was the founder . His the way he got out of Iraq was that , that was the founding of ISIS , okay ? <p> Trump is then even more explicit : <p> DT : I mean , with his bad policies , that 's why ISIS came about . <p> HH : That 's ... <p> DT : If he would have done things properly , you would n't have had ISIS . <p> HH @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was the founder of ISIS . <p> It sounds to me like Hewitt and Trump are basically talking past each other . They agree that Obama was not the actual founder of ISIS , but that Obama bears some responsibility for the rise of ISIS given his initial inaction and his creation of a power vacuum in Iraq . But to Trump , that makes him a de facto founder of ISIS , while Hewitt disagrees . So when Trump stood by his comments , he was standing by his ( admittedly stupid ) definition of " founder . " <p> The " founder of ISIS " charge is n't so much conspiracy-mongering as it is more hyperbole and loose language from Trump . So to see headlines from outlets like CNN reading " Donald Trump : I meant that Obama founded ISIS , literally " based off the Hewitt interview seems like a disservice to their readers . Trump 's comments were bad , but we can still be honest about why they were bad . <p> As The Washington Examiner 's Eddie Scarry points out , Trump @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inventor " of ISIS for the past seven months , always in connection with her failure to stop the rise of ISIS . This appears to be the first time it was taken literally and turned into a major story . The other times , the press seemed to recognize that it was just an over-the-top rhetorical flourish , rolled their eyes , and moved on . <p> Which brings me to my larger point : when it comes to over-the-top rhetoric accusing your political opponents of working for America 's enemies , multiple liberals and Democrats have gotten a free pass for exactly the same kind of remarks . <p> " He is becoming ISIS 's best recruiter , " Clinton said of Trump in December during a Democratic primary debate . " They are going out to people showing videos of Donald Trump insulting Islam and Muslims in order to recruit more radical jihadists . " <p> Clinton 's remarks raised a bit of the stir at the time , but only because the allegation underlying her rhetoric that Trump had been featured in ISIS recruitment videos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ examination of the facts behind her claim , that Clinton was characterizing a major political rival as working for a terrorist organization that murdered Americans went virtually unremarked upon . <p> There was , to the media 's credit , substantial criticism directed at President Barack Obama when he claimed that those who opposed the Iran deal were " making common cause " with Iranian radicals chanting " Death to America . " But when he ( and virtually every liberal pundit taking cues from the administration ) claimed with a straight face that Republicans were doing " exactly what ISIS wants " when they recommended taking a tougher stance against the terror group , conservatives cried foul but mainstream media outlets took little notice . <p> " Donald Trump is the ISIS candidate , " MSNBC 's terrorism expert declared solemnly last month . " Will ISIS Soon Endorse Donald Trump ? " asked CNN and the Daily Beast 's Dean a Mediaite op-ed . " Donald Trump is , in effect , the recruiter in chief for ISIS , " veteran newsman Ted on Meet the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conservatives were accused of being de facto ISIS agents f0r the crime of disagreeing with the president . <p> I 'll concede that Trump went further than Clinton or Obama did by saying they were founders of ISIS , rather than agents or recruiters . But I 'd bet good money that Trump 's comments would have received just as much pickup if he had only called them " footsoldiers " or " backers " or such . The basic principle remains the same . <p> I end with this thought : this is entirely a mess of Trump 's making . Even if he really , really decided he had to call Obama the " founder of ISIS , " he completely lacks the coherence necessary to even explain himself properly . He ca n't then be shocked when his explanation is misinterpreted . <p> There 's also a reason why so many people immediately assumed Trump was saying Obama was the literal founder of ISIS : because it sounds exactly like the insane conspiracy theories Trump puts forwards every day . It 's the same reason that everyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When you intentionally build a reputation as a " politically incorrect " jerk who makes horrifying statements , you ca n't then complain when people immediately think the worst of you . <p> There 's also a boy-who-cried-wolf element at play here . Time and time again , Donald Trump has said terrible , violent , bigoted statements , only to immediately lie afterwards and say the media was taking him out of context . Well now that it 's actually happening for once , who 's going to believe him ? <h> Disney 's '

 that Andrea Tantaros appeared on Fox News was Monday , April 25 . The former cohost of The Five turned Outnumbered staple was the source of conversation from time to time in the Mediaite offices , especially as attention turned to her new book , Tied Up in Knots . The book was frequently discussed on Outnumbered , and when it was released , others on the network briefly promoted Tantaros ' text as well . <p> And then , Tantaros was off-air , suddenly , and without warning .

 here yesterday , one of the many incredibly depressing elements of having Donald Trump as the GOP nominee is the constant need to have his supporters say things that are not just not true , but are clearly based in nothing but wishful , even magical , thinking . The new narrative being floated by his campaign manager and by Rush Limbaugh , among others , with regard to why he is losing in the polls is a perfect example . The great irony is that I believe this lame theory will actually reduce Trump 's already very limited chances of winning , while increasing the humiliation once he does . <p> Trump 's newly-minted " campaign manager " and pollster Kellyanne Conway ( is n't it weird that the " tell it like it is " guy who supposedly does n't care about being politically correct now has a pollster supposedly running his campaign ? ) is now claiming that Trump is actually winning because the polls are wrong . The polls are wrong , she says , because there are " undercover " Trump voters who are afraid to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There is a technical term for these types of rationalizations : Bullshit . <p> Let 's go through all of the many holes in this notion that Trump ca n't get out of the low 40s ( at best ) in national and key states polls but that without anything dramatic happening , he will suddenly turnout at least 47% of the electorate and beat Hillary Clinton . <p> First , if Trump is really " winning " as Conway says , then why was she and Steve Bannon hired to replace Paul Manafort in a second major shakeup in the campaign in recent months ? <p> Third , Conway 's theory is inherently contradictory . The entire premise that the polls are wrong is based on the notion that the massive and incredibly enthusiastic crowds who show up at Trump 's rallies are a better representation of what is really going on than the polls are . But this makes no sense in relation to the super-shy Trump voter theory . On the one hand Trump voters are willing to show up in public for events with lots of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them are afraid to tell an anonymous pollster who does n't know their name that they will vote for him ? This is infantile and magical " thinking , " even by Trump standards . <p> Forth , there is absolutely no evidence to suggest that Trump over-preformed polling in the primaries ( if anything , it was slightly the opposite ) and given his woeful on the ground organization in key swing states , the likelihood is far stronger that he will underperform his polling in November than that there will be a shocking surge of previously bashful Trump supporters show up to vote . <p> Fifth , Limbaugh 's similar theory shows a shocking lack of understanding of how polls are even conducted . He seems to think that if you have never voted or are n't registered that you are n't on the radar of any pollster . This is simply not true . While most polls do report results based on " registered " and " likely " voters , many do also report on " adults , " and there is no evidence to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Also , where 's the logic in the idea that millions of Trump voters are suddenly just now register to vote for the first time so they can cast a ballot just for him ? His campaign has been the number one news story in America for over a year . Every single state has already given the prospective " disaffected " Trump voter a great reason to register for the primaries ( when , by the way , there was very little evidence of " new " Trump voters ) . If these people really do exist , there is simply not enough of them to overcome a major deficit . <p> Finally , all of this is coming off of a 2012 election cycle where nearly every conservative ( except for me and maybe a couple of others ) convinced themselves that , despite what the polls were saying that Mitt Romney was not only going to beat President Obama , but would likely do so in a landslide . You would think that such an epic fail would cause there to be at least a little hesitation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this time with far worse polling for the Republican candidate ) , but in Trump 's GOP the desire to believe in magic is strong . So robust , in fact , that conservative pundit Dana Perino was recently forced to almost apologize on Fox News for admitting that she believes in polling . <p> The great irony here that this entire actually diminishes the chances that Trump could really pull off this near-miracle . This is because Hillary 's biggest weakness is obviously going to be a glaring lack of enthusiasm among her voters , making her vulnerable to low turnout . If , in a rational world , Trump was perceived as polling a solid 3-4 points behind Hillary until election day , I could foresee a scenario where an over-confident and lackadaisical Democrat base simply fails to show up in tremendous numbers and that Trump 's enthusiasm advantage could , if everything went perfectly , close the gap enough to at least dream about pulling this off . <p> However , the entire narrative of Trump being a " magic " candidate with scary " undercover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a horror movie where the monsters are undereducated white male Trump supporters , should be more than enough to keep both Hillary 's supporters and the news media ( I know , they are the same thing ) from getting complacent . <p> This is kind of like an early season college football game when no one really knows who is good and who is n't . If you are ahead in the fourth quarter and are playing Alabama you are going to be far more on edge and aggressive than if you have the same lead against a team you have no reason to fear . <p> In this case , about the only thing that Hillary Clinton has to fear , is the lack of fear itself , a concern which should now be put to rest thanks to Trump supporters laughably claiming he processes magic when he does n't . <p> -- <p> John Ziegler is a nationally-syndicated radio talk show host and documentary filmmaker .

She explained that written reporting is almost informal in the way interviews are conducted , whereas television interviews are more formal .

 a lawsuit from back when Bannon was the director at Biosphere 2 -- one of those bio-domes simulating what it would be like on the surface of Mars -- and the facility 's former director alleged sexual harassment from both Bannon and banker Mark Bowen . <p> Margret Augustine made the following allegations : <p> Both Bowen and Bannon were insulting to the plaintiff and other females employees of Biosphere 2 , and in their presence , and against their will , made lewd remarks , told offensive off-color stories , made disparaging remarks about females , made sexually suggestive remarks , discussed females they had known in a lewd and derogatory fashion and in general acted with total indifference to the feelings of the plaintiff and other female employees of Biosphere 2 . <p> She also claimed the two of them " made comments as women walked by about the size of women 's breasts and body parts in lewd tones and language , " and that there were other female employees of the biosphere that were similarly harassed . <p> Mother Jones recently reported that back then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had called one of the plaintiffs a ' self-centered , deluded young woman ' and a ' bimbo .

" After all that is the exact comment Trump used when he maligned Mexican immigrants as being rapists and drug dealers but his supporters had no problem with that . <p> Her second mistake as Clinton has acknowledged -- was quantifying the percentage of Trump supporters who subscribe to hateful and truly un-American views .

Here are some examples : <p> 1 . White Supremacists : David Duke does n't just support Trump in spirit , he recently recorded a robocall to help attract other white supremacists to vote Trump . And other leading white supremacists also love Trump such as Richard Spencer and Jared recently told the media " Most white people , whether they say so or not , would prefer to live ... in a majority white country but they 're too terrified to say it .

We are talking Jewish reporters being sent Holocaust imagery such as cartoons of Jews being shot in the head and ovens , calling them at home and playing Hitler speeches and making death threats . It became so alarming that one female Jewish reporter bought a gun to protect her family from Trump 's anti-Semitic fans .

Instead Trump responded , " I do n't have a message to the fans . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ support . ) <p> 4 . Anti-LGBT : Just this past weekend Trump spoke to his adoring fans at the Value Voters Summit , an event The Advocate notes is " a yearly conference hosted by the homophobic , transphobic Family Research Council . " This groups despicable goal is preventing gays and lesbians from being treated equally in America as noted on its website : " We oppose the vigorous efforts of homosexual activists to demand that homosexuality be accepted as equivalent to heterosexuality in law , in the media , and in schools .

" For those lucky enough to have not heard of Geller , she has been denounced the Anti Defamation League and the Southern Poverty Law Center for her jihad against Muslims .

 About His Defense of Roger Ailes <p> On Tuesday morning 's edition of The Today Show , Fox News personality Bill O'Reilly promised to " keep my big mouth shut " about the serious allegations of sexual misconduct being leveled at now-former Fox News Chairman Roger Ailes , but even as he made the promise , O'Reilly said enough to land him in hot water . Or hot pants , at least , as in the " on fire " variety , because O'Reilly also told interviewer Savannah Guthrie that " all I said " in Ailes ' defense was that he was " a good boss , best boss I 've ever had . " <p> Savannah Guthrie on Tuesday pressed O'Reilly on similar support that he gave to Ailes following the lawsuit initially filed by Gretchen Carlson in July . <p> SAVANNAH GUTHRIE ( CO-HOST ) : We have to ask you about what 's been going on at Fox News . Obviously Roger Ailes is no longer there in the wake of these sexual harassment allegations and revelations . You 've been on record saying you support him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last few months that makes you change your mind about that ?

Nothing . So he was a good boss , best boss I 've ever had , and that 's what I said to Seth Meyers . That 's all I 've said . And I 'm not going to say anything else because I work for this company and I do n't really have any insight into anything , so for once in my life I 'm going to keep my big mouth shut . <p> As longtime Fox News watchdogs Media pointed out , however , that 's really not all he said , although for some reason , Media O'Reilly 's recollection a " whitewash " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , because O'Reilly very clearly suggested that Gretchen Carlson 's lawsuit was " frivolous " : <p> SETH MEYERS ( HOST ) : Gretchen Carlson , your old colleague at Fox News , has issued some allegations , some sexual harassment allegations , over your boss Roger Ailes . What is your position on this , or what did you think when you heard this ? <p> BILL O'REILLY : Well , I think it 's a very sad situation , number one . And I 'm just going to say this about it . I 've worked for Roger Ailes for 20 years , right . Best boss I 've ever had . Straight shooter , always honest with me . And I believe that over the years , he 's been in the business for 50 years , 95 percent of the people who have worked for Roger Ailes would say exactly the same thing that I just told you .

 of his first head-to-head with Hillary Clinton , Donald Trump 's performance has been met with glowing praise , fierce condemnation , and everything in between . Depending on how you feel about the mogul though , online conversation would tell you that he either had a clean-sweep , or that he did so badly that it 's time to slap him again with some Internet mockery . <p> While it has yet to be determined who won with voters last night , the hashtag #TrumpWon emerged on Twitter overnight . Naturally , Trump himself took notice . <p> It 's not 
 of the Debate was Conservatism <p> With all of the understandable analysis of who " won " ( Hillary Clinton did ) or " lost " the big first presidential debate , the biggest and most unquestionable loser has been mostly overlooked . In my view , that is clearly the concept of conservatism . <p> In about one hundred minutes of discussion , I can recall only one principle that was fairly well outlined and which also resembled anything close to traditional conservative political theory . That was when Donald Trump claimed that under his presidency taxes would go down significantly for businesses and that jobs would be created through a version of what liberals have often ( wrongly ) derided as " trickle-down " economics . <p> But even in the realm of taxes Trump mocked real conservatism by forcing his Republican supporters to pretend that it is is n't extremely troublesome that he has not released his own taxes ( after promising to do so and lying about why he supposedly ca n't ) , or that it seems that he admitted that he pays very little , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supposedly being a multi-billionaire while not paying taxes makes him " smart , " and " conservative " in an Ebenezer Scrooge sort of way . But the reality is that a real conservative of his alleged wealth ( at least one with even a modicum of class ) would never push the law so perversely as to be audited on yearly basis , in what he obviously sees as a yearly negotiation process . <p> For the rest of the debate , there was basically nothing that was discussed which would closely resemble what Ronald Reagan , for instance , might have said on any other topic . Now , to be fair , this was partly because moderator Lester Holt decided that this debate would be fought on mostly on non-philosophical turf and almost exclusively on subjects to the liking of Hillary Clinton . However , much of the blame for this can and should be pointed at Trump who , as I and others have been saying for over a year , is not remotely conservative . <p> Perhaps the most astonishing proof of this came in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " law and order . " Forgetting for a moment that Republicans used to at least pretend to be protectors of liberty and freedom , Trump completely betrayed conservatism even on one of the three core issues where he is currently still pretending to be a believer ( four if you laughably count Supreme Court picks , which Trump tellingly barely even mentioned on Monday night ) . <p> Trump has continually claimed , in addition to being a border hawk on immigration and supposedly being " pro-life " , that he is a great defender of the 2nd Amendment right to bear arms . And yet , on two major occasions during the debate , Trump actually staked out positions which , if Hillary alone had voiced them , would have had the NRA and the " conservative " media up in " arms . " <p> Trump supported taking away the gun rights of American citizens put on the " terror watch list , " which is a designation with which one can be labeled with almost no due process and often in complete error . Even more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Hillary on the issue of police engaging in so-called " stop-and-frisk , " saying that it is a good idea to " take the guns away " from " bad " guys in inner-cities . <p> Not only would implementing this policy be way outside his dominion as president ( at least under the Constitution , assuming that still matters ) and include no realistic due-process protections , but , given the locations where Trump is proposing this procedure be instituted , it also seems tinged with racism . However , despite all of this , the NRA was silent , refusing to even lightly criticize their chosen candidate , even as he created two very slippery slopes by which gun rights could be easily eviscerated . <p> Trump also declared that as president he would not " allow " American companies to move elsewhere , and it sure felt as if he did n't mean by simply offering incentives/penalties to make sure they did n't . Meanwhile , his delusional view that he can magically restore jobs lost from another economic era is based in an overly-optimistic view @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ principle of free trade . <p> Even worse than Trump not articulating any cogent argument for conservatism , however , is the abundantly obvious reality that not only does Trump not really believe in it , but that he simply does n't possess ANY political philosophy . Trump sees everything and everyone only through the prism of what is good for Trump on THAT day . <p> The travesties of all of this are many . I believe that a legitimate conservative with no real baggage like Marco Rubio would have crushed Hillary in that debate and would be headed to the White House with the goal of preserving Antonin Scalia 's Supreme Court seat . Possibly just as sad as that reality is that , these principles will now go at least eight years between opportunities to educate the non-political public about them , on a grand stage , with little filtering by the mostly liberal news media . <p> In a very real sense , it is like " conservatism " is a country which , through no fault of its own ( but rather by the cowardice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but who sell out for a few pieces of silver ) has been banned from an Olympic Games . This obviously would have a devastating impact not just on the present , but also its future . That 's because losing an entire " generation " is a blow from which recovery is nearly impossible . <p> The only question now is whether conservatism , assuming it is n't already dead , would die sooner if Trump loses , or if he somehow wins . It is my belief that it is far more likely be the latter . <h> Tenn . House

 What Kind of Genius Loses a Billion Dollars In a Single Year ? ' <p> Hillary Clinton ripped Donald Trump over the revelation that he lost nearly a billion dollars in a single year and may have used the enormous loss to avoid paying income tax for close to 20 years , according to a bombshell report in the New York Times . <p> Speaking at a rally in Toldeo , Ohio , Monday afternoon , Clinton accused Trump of having " made all those bad bets and lost all that money , " and using his accountants and political connections to avoid paying taxes , while leaving his contractors and employees in the dust .

 Campaign News , Nearly All the Cards Turn , Predictably Against Trump <p> One of the hallmarks of this unprecedentedly insane ( and yet , oddly , ultimately predictable ) presidential campaign is that events which would have been massive news stories in prior cycles have gone almost unnoticed . For instance , remember when a major newspaper published photos of Trump 's wife , apparently with his approval , two days in a row ? Remarkably , neither does hardly anyone else . <p> Similarly , the flurry of news in the last few days has allowed several campaign stories to effectively go , at least so far , without a full " hearing " in the news media . Here I will attempt to catch up on many of them with some random thoughts and analysis . <p> In the wake of Trump 's unsurprisingly disastrous debate performance , he became obsessed with former Miss Universe Alicia Machado and bogus online polls showing him winning a debate he clearly lost . As damaging as that was ( at least to ) , those misguided rants may have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worse news . <p> Most amazingly , a cover story in Newsweek outlining the case that Trump 's organization had broken the Cuba embargo in order to investigate the possibility of a golf course in the land of Fidel Castro barely registered on the major media radar in comparison to its potential political impact . <p> A Republican can simply not win a close race in Florida without strong support from anti-Castro Cubans there . If this story , which was not remotely even denied substantively by the Trump campaign , gets traction within that community , even with the recent U.S. policy softening towards Cuba , it is very tough to see how Trump survives there . Of course , without Florida , he can not possibly win the election . <p> Also overshadowed ( at least until today when the New York attorney general took action to shut it down ) by the Machado insanity was the remarkable revelation that the Trump Foundation , which has already been exposed as an outrageous fraud by the Washington Post , was n't even legally certified to accept donations . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's " charity " money to buy himself absurd things and fund lawsuits against his enemies , but now , it appears , the organization does n't even pass the most rudimentary standards of legitimacy . <p> But please remember , Trump always hires the very best and smartest people ! <p> Then came the " bombshell " from The New York Times , which had apparently been mailed a tiny fraction of Trump 's 1995 tax return . Those documents revealed that he had taken almost a billion dollar loss that year . While the Times has come under attack from some corners as having an agenda against Trump ( which they clearly do , but not without legitimate reasons ) , it seemed to me that the way they portrayed the story was actually as " favorable " to Trump as possible . <p> Based on seemingly nothing but educated speculation , the Times framed the tax revelations as effectively an explanation/excuse for why Trump may , quite legally , not have paid any federal income taxes for the most of the past two decades . While that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ focus , the Times actually buried their own lede . <p> Based on what we currently know for sure to be true , the story really should have been , " Trump 's Enormous 1995 Financial Loss Discredits his Business Narrative , Raises Charges of Hypocrisy , and New Questions about His Refusal to Release His Taxes . " <p> Here is a guy who is running for president solely on the mythology of his business record and yet he does n't even release his taxes ( even when he could now humiliate The New York Times by doing so if their presumptions were false ) , all while routinely mocking others on Twitter for not paying enough in taxes to the federal government . At least so far , the news media is actually letting Trump off the hook a bit over what little we have learned so far about this issue , though it is certainly very likely to come up again at Sunday 's next debate . <p> Weirdly , the very best moment for Trump in the last week came with the release of a videotaped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was made public , supposedly , against his team 's wishes . As a " Never Trump " conservative who has actually been searching in vain for over a year for a version of Trump that I could find remotely acceptable as president , this particular species ( calm , understated , thoughtful , etc. ) was actually as close as I have found . Similarly , I also thought the dustup over Hillary Clinton 's " secretly recorded " comments about Bernie Sanders supporters living in their parent 's basement to be completely overblown and actually made me feel slightly better about her impending presidency ( hey , at least she seems to believe that a president really does need the approval of Congress to do big things ! ) . <p> On Sunday night we learned that NBA superstar LeBron wholeheartedly endorsed Clinton . I see this as almost the inverse of the story of Trump violating the Cuba embargo . It certainly seems very tough ( despite recent polls showing him ahead there ) for Trump to win Ohio now . Currently the Republican governor there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , by far the most popular person in the state and fresh off of bringing Cleveland their first championship in most of the population 's lifetimes , is helping Hillary get key demographics to the polls . At the very least , since Ohio is an obvious " must-win " state , this will at least require the Trump campaign to keep putting valuable resources there . I also see this endorsement by James as further opening the floodgates for big-time celebrities to feel more comfortable being totally open about supporting Clinton . <p> Finally , on Monday , in addition to the ruling on his bogus foundation , Trump also got hit with another Newsweek investigation which exposes further hypocrisy on his key issue of protecting American manufacturing jobs , specifically against China . Should this story get the play that it would seemingly deserve , how Trump could make a comeback in the nearly must-win state of Pennsylvania , or the even tougher sell of Michigan , would be impossible to comprehend without a " game-changing " event of enormous magnitude . <p> In short , what we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Trump campaign which is still viable enough to win 270 Electoral College votes . But if/when that reality finally becomes abundantly clear to a news media ( especially the " conservative " variety which is currently invested in him ) very understandably hesitant to declare the " magical " Trump dead , I really hope we wo n't have to endure a bull-crap narrative about how the events of the last few days finally started to bring this national nightmare to an end . <p> The reality is that none of what we have learned in the last week is remotely surprising and it was all far too easily predictable . All that has really happened is that dealer at the election casino has finally dealt a series of cards from a deck fully " stacked " against Trump by his own complete lack of qualifications for the job . None of this is the fault of liberal media bias . The blame belongs solely on Trump and his many enablers in the " conservative media " during the primaries , who were either too stupid to see the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corrupt to care . <h> The pain and

 thoroughly researched and published at a time when the rumor mill surrounding Jeb Bush was heating up that there may actually be a third Bush president , and months before Donald Trump would take his infamous escalator trip to casually slam Mexicans as rapists . <p> Giles , in no uncertain terms , referred to the Bush family as a " sprawling political dynasty , " but the reason that the information stuck with me so strongly was an exclamation I made out loud to no one in particular when I got to the second page : <p> " Billy Bush is a Bush ? ! " <p> I mean , I knew that Access Hollywood host Billy Bush had the last name of Bush , but it never even remotely dawned on me to consider that he was a member of the Bush political family . Of course , he is not the only member of the tribe heavily invested in the media ; George W. Bush 's daughter Jenna has served as a contributor to the NBC TODAY Show , and the New York Mag 's spread revealed a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> I surprised many of my Mediaite colleagues earlier this summer with my Fun Fact about Billy Bush when he was at the center of the Ryan Lochte controversy in Rio ( Lochte gave his first post " robbery " interview to Bush directly , claims that were eventually proven false . Matt Lauer scored the more sought after follow-up with the disgraced Olympian ) . Did you know Bill Bush is , like , a Bush Bush ? I would say , and my colleagues would roll their eyes with the same indifference I face when I spout off my other favorite fun facts , like how the word " democracy " does not appear anywhere in the Constitution . <p> So the tremendous irony of the new situation that Donald Trump finds himself in struck me immediately . <p> After all , it has largely been the Trump v. Bush dynamic that has launched him into the position of political power he now finds himself . During the Republican primary process , the real estate mogul absolutely eviscerated former Florida Governor Jeb , making a public spectacle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ punching bag in dire need of a 5 Hour Energy . <p> In time , Trump would further solidify his anti-establishment place in modern American conservatism . In addition to indicating that President George W. Bush outright lied to the American people ( he once toldWolf Blitzer , " Well , he lied . He got us into the way with lies , " ) , Trump distanced himself from the Bush brand of Republican politics by essentially faulting Bush 43 with the attacks of 9/11 during a campaign stop in South Carolina . <p> Reportedly , even Poppy Bush has since indicated that when it comes to choosing a President on November 8th , Democratic challenger Hillary Clintonwill be earning his vote . To this date , neither Bush 41 , Bush 43 , nor Jeb himself have supported Trump 's candidacy , unable to derail it despite the popularity of the Bush name in American conservative circles . <p> Enter Billy boy . <p> Billy Bush is the son of Josephine Bradley and Jonathan Bush , a banker in Connecticut , one of the leaders in the second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1932 , is the brother of William H.T. Bush ( a banker ) , Nancy Walker Bush , Prescott Bush Jr . ( an insurance executive with a failed Senate run to his name ) and George Herbert Walker Bush himself . <p> If you 're following along , this makes Billy Bush the first cousin of President George W. Bush and Jeb Bush , the first cousin once removed of Jenna Bush , and the nephew of no-new-taxes himself . <p> He was also in a bus with Donald Trump eleven years ago when the real estate mogul and reality TV star said , " Grab ' em by the pussy , " a revelation that threatens to derail all of his presidential ambitions . <p> " Come on shorty , " Bush can be heard saying on the tape that The Washington Post leaked on Friday afternoon . The conversation between the two men is right in line with what Trump called it immediately after its release to the public : locker room banter between a few of the guys , never to be seen or heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bush that day , " I moved on her like a bitch . But I could n't get there . And she was married . Then all of a sudden I see her , she 's now got the big phony tits and everything . She 's totally changed her look . " <p> " Sheesh , your girl 's hot as shit . In the purple , " replied Bush . <p> For people in the American electorate this year who have long supported the values of small government and Constitutional originality long peddled by the Bush brand of politics who have resisted the Trumpian overthrow of the Grand Old Party it is perhaps the sweetest bit of delicious irony that it is ( inadvertently of course ) a Bush who is indirectly responsible for what could finally be Trump 's downfall . The Republican nominee is losing a staggering number of influential party endorsements today , with calls for Veep choice Mike Pence to replace Trump at the top of the ticket . Though Trump told the Wall Street Journal this morning that there is simply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it 's difficult to imagine rebounding from the vicious blow he will likely suffer from . <p> And to think : instead of getting into verbal spats on a debate stage calling Trump a " chaos candidate , " all Jeb Bush really had to do to crash Trump 's campaign was take him aside and shoot the shit like one of the boys . <h> Merced victims of

Campaign manager Kellyanne Conway said GOP leaders were being " wishy-washy " and " pussyfooting " around , rather than coming out in unanimous support of Trump . <h> Six Seasons Later 
 on an email obtained by WikiLeaks showing then-CNNer Donna Brazile apparently sending Team Clinton a heads-up on a CNN town hall question . Brazile denied ever sending candidate questions ahead of time , there were reports this may have just been Brazile sending over information about a TV panel she was going to appear on , and CNN said in a statement to Mediaite , " To be perfectly clear , we have never , ever given a town hall question to anyone beforehand . " <p> Politico today obtained another email that they say was " word for word the language of a question that Brazile appeared to have sent to the Clinton campaign a day earlier . " <p> The email in question was allegedly sent by TV One 's Roland Martin , co-moderator of the March town hall . Martin sent some questions to CNN producers , including this : <p> DEATH PENALTY <p> 19 states and the District of Columbia have banned the death penalty . 31 states , including Ohio , still have the death penalty . According to the National Coalition to Abolish the Death @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ death row and later set free . Since 1976 , 1,414 people have been executed in the U.S. That 's 11% of Americans who were sentenced to die , but later exonerated and freed . Should Ohio and the 30 other states join the current list and abolish the death penalty ? <p> Not only is this the exact wording of what Brazile sent to the Clinton campaign , but Politico says both the spacing and capitalization are the same . <p> Martin spoke to Politico about his prep before the town hall : <p> In a follow up interview on Tuesday , Martin said that he did send his questions to CNN via his producer and his TV One team . <p> In a follow up email on Wednesday , upon being informed of the email POLITICO had obtained , Martin said he did not believe had had consulted with Brazile ahead of the town hall . <p> " As far as consultation , I do n't believe I did . I know I asked all of my social media followers for their input on what they wanted me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Clinton town hall we did in South Carolina in 2014 . And I know that I called Rep. Clyburn to lock down language on his 10-20-30 amendment . That is an issue I 've pushed for several years . I also know I called other members of Congress to ask them specific questions about their various bills and their status . All of that informed my questions . That 's called research , " Martin wrote . <h> Sheriff : Lynnwood 
 was published Wednesday night alleging that Donald Trump committed sexual harassment in the years prior to his presidential run . <p> Mindy McGillivray says that Trump groped her behind 13 years ago at his Mar-A-Lago resort , according to The Palm Beach Post . " Donald just grabbed my ass ! " she reportedly told her friend . She was 23 at the time . <p> Please enable Javascript to watch . <p> The Post 's Joe Capozzi writes : <p> " All of a sudden I felt a grab , a little nudge . I think it 's Ken 's camera bag , that was my first instinct . I turn around and there 's Donald . He sort of looked away quickly . I quickly turned back , facing Ray Charles , and I 'm stunned . ' <p> McGillivray said she remembers saying to herself , ' ' ' OK , am I going to say something now and make a scene or be quiet ? ' I chose to stay quiet .

She thought about her own daughter . And she did some soul-searching before she reached out to us . " <p> Capozzi 's story was published on the heels of another in the New York Times , which reported on two women who accused Trump of sexual misconduct : one on a plane some thirty years ago , the other in Trump Tower in 2005. <h> More <p> PHILADELPHIA 
 Dobbs Tweets Out Personal Info On One Of Trump 's Accusers <p> A day after the New York Times reported on two women who have accused Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump of inappropriate sexual touching , a Fox Business host decided to tweet out one of the accusers personal information . <p> In the since-deleted tweet , Lou Dobbs quoted a tweet from Michael detailing the address and phone number for Jessica Leeds , a 74-year-old woman who said Trump groped her three decades ago . <p> Business a screen image of the tweet prior to it being deleted and redacted out Leeds ' information . <p> Even though did delete the tweet , it was up on Dobbs ' timeline for two hours and had been retweeted hundreds of times .

 in Manhattan and head upward and westward to 160 Riverside Boulevard , you 'll find yourself at Trump Place , an apartment complex that is as ostentatious as it is luxurious . Once you get past the gilded exterior , you 'll also find some residents who are less than thrilled to be living in a building bearing the name of the Republican nominee for the presidency . <p> Listen , the Upper West Side has always been liberal , but a new report from Buzzfeed News is showing just how humiliated those within Trump Place really are by what Donald Trump has done to the GOP . The building is owned by Equity Residential and has been since 2007 , but the Trump name remains attached to the building . <p> According to the report , residents want the name removed from the property altogether . <p> An occupant named Mallory Gibson is quoted saying , " Uber drivers have commented on how it is the Trump building when dropping me off at night and then given me a bad rating while I was still in the car ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been under the impression New Yorkers liked the Trump name , which is why they kept it on the building when they acquired it in 2007 . <p> " The truth is , " said one man named Gary , " we never thought of him . " <p> Gibson said that if the management wo n't remove the name , they should lower the rent for those who have to " deal with it . " <p> One of the people interviewed for the report was a volunteer for the Hillary Clinton campaign and nearly all of the people interviewed refused to refer to their building as " Trump Place . " <p> One woman said this : <p> Everything is marble , but the walls are really thin and sort of shabby . I always say , if he runs the country like he made this building , we 're in trouble . <h> Yearly Price Target 
 is a weird one if only because women who were reportedly groped in nightclubs and who host syndicated celebrity gossip shows are playing an integral role in the election of the next President . <p> Other women , like conservative pundits Laura Ingraham and Ann Coulter , want to play their part , too , so they 've been trying to defend Donald Trump as more and more stories ( and recordings ) of his allegedly sexually predatory behavior emerge . <p> The only problem is that they 've targeted other women -- Beyonc ? and Nicki Minaj to help them make their point , but in doing so , they have brought massive ire upon themselves . <p> Let 's start with Coulter , who tweeted this : <p> Beyonce , cited by Michelle Obama as role model for her daughters , sings about " pussy curvalicious , served delicious . " Oh my . I just fainted . <p> Close , but not quite ! The line she referenced is from a Beyonc ? song , but was actually rapped by Minaj . In " ***Flawless ( Remix @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rhymed , " , pussy served delicious . " <p> Like the remix , the original version of " ***Flawless " is about women empowering themselves , focusing on strengthening female friendships , sticking together , and not tolerating outdated ideas about living to serve men . The original sampled a TEDx Talk by Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie that centered on the importance of rejecting the notion that women should seek to grow only into subservient wives . <p> Coulter 's argument seems to depend on Minaj 's use of the word " pussy " and the theory that people who are railing against Trump have taken moral issue with his use of the same word during " locker room talk . " <p> However , most of Trump 's detractors are not as outraged by the word " pussy " as they are by Trump telling Billy Bush that famous men can get away with grabbing women by the pussy . That amounts of the promotion of sexual assault , according to a number of outspoken opponents of Trump 's , including First Lady Michelle Obama , whose praise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> By referring to her privates as something being " served , " Minaj is , in effect , giving her partner her consent , which a woman being grabbed " by the pussy " by a famous man has not done . <p> Once again , these lyrics include mentions of consent . It is being argued that to sing that a man " let me play with his ... " is to acknowledge that he consented to the activity . To many who noticed and responded to the tweet , then , there is no correlation between this admittedly raunchy talk and the sexual assault allegations against Trump that have so many politicians and pundits worked up . <h> China , now

 campaign is going nuclear on the chairman of the Ohio Republican party and accusing him of " duplicity . " <p> Matt Borges , who supported John Kasich in the primary and said last week his own wife does n't want a Trump sign in their yard , reacted as many other Republicans did to the lewd comments Trump made on that 2005 audio . He still publicly supports Trump , but he openly said , " I 've been very public about saying that there will be no repercussions for anyone who feels like they need to withdraw their support or endorsement of Mr. Trump .

 discussion between a CNN contributor and a Donald Trump supporter , Don Lemon got deeply personal over the accusations that the mogul sexually abused multiple women . <p> The accusations were the subject of a spirited discussion between Margaret Hoover and Scottie Nell Hughes , where they argued over whether there are holes in the Trump accusers ' stories , and why they waited until now to go public . Lemon compared the situation to Bill Cosby 's downfall , stating that one possibility was that these women felt intimidated by Trump 's wealth and prestige , and that they feared their accusations would n't be seen as credible . <p> Hughes argued that Cosby 's accusers had evidence to back their allegations where Trump 's accusers do not . Hughes went on to complain about how much media conversation went towards the women , and that Trump 's alleged sexual assault is not more important than the WikiLeaks release of John Podesta 's emails . <p> Please enable Javascript to watch . <p> Lemon did not approve of Hughes ' take on the assault allegations , and he was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's really insulting , especially as someone who is a survivor of sexual abuse and who is a product of a single mother and was raised with all sisters and aunts and who looked after me .

 , let 's get the twist ending out of the way : The man you 're about to see rail against Donald Trump 's claims that voter fraud is an epidemic and the election will be rigged is still voting for Donald Trump . That tidbit came at the end of a six-minute interview segment and was quite the reveal , but for our purposes , let 's just run with it from the jump . <p> So , here is Jon Husted , Ohio 's Secretary of State , calmly debunking all of the big talking points about voter fraud and election-rigging . He revealed that one woman who was caught actually trying to commit voter fraud went to prison and that most people wo n't risk having to do that . <p> After calling Trump 's criticism of the voting process " irresponsible , " he also suggested that if Trump or the voters are really that concerned , they should actually speak to their Secretary of State . If they are aware of real voter fraud , they should tell someone who can make a difference . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , " he said . " Do n't just make an allegation on Twitter . Tell me .

 at the Huffington Post Sam Stein said Monday morning that the hacked Hillary Clinton campaign emails released by Wikileaks confirm all the worst suspicions about how the political power couple acted out of office . <p> The panel of MSNBC 's Morning Joe in particular took aim at an email showing that the Qatari government gave the Clinton Foundation $1 million as a " birthday present " to Bill Clinton , and wanted to meet him in person in return . " I call the $1 million gift club the second-tier friends , " Stein joked to loud laughter . " This is how I grade my friends . " <p> " As Bloomberg 's Mark Halperin said , this confirms sort of the worst portraits of the Clintons and how they operated out of office , " he continued . " and it raises obvious questions about why they were accepting this money . " <p> " You know , there were charitable purposes that went along with the Clinton Foundation , but of course it came with a conflict of interest , " Stein said . <p> After recently getting

American Bridge , a pro-Clinton Super PAC run by David Brock , dug up footage of Trump telling NY1 that he was cool with Michael Bloomberg pushing New York City to extend its term limits when he ran for mayor a third time . <p> " Well , I 'm not a believer in term limits , " Trump told the host . " If you do n't like someone , you push a button .

 a Wall In Front of Trump 's Las Vegas Hotel <p> It may not be a taco truck on every corner , but dozens of food trucks will make a statement on Wednesday when they form a wall around Trump International Hotel in Las Vegas . <p> Vegas is the site of the final presidential debate between Republican nominee Donald Trump and Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton . It was a Trump surrogate who was the inspiration for this demonstration as he warned that if Trump did n't become POTUS , we would have " taco trucks on every corner . " And , of course , Trump famously wants to build a wall at the southern border and make Mexico pay for it . <p> According to NBC News , the union workers organizing this have dual reasons for doing this tomorrow . One , they want to make a statement about his rhetoric about building the wall . <p> " We did not come up with the idea for the wall , Donald Trump came up with building the wall , " said Yvanna Cancela , the political director of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We want to show him that walls do n't divide us , and rather what he has done is uniting us .

" <p> Second , they want to highlight Trump 's treatment of his workers . <p> " While we will have taco trucks , the reason we are out there is for the last year now Trump has illegally refused to bargain with workers who won a union election at his hotel , " Cancela said . " The biggest message we have sent to him is he needs to come to the negotiation table .

 of blog posts , The Washington Post columnist Erik Wemple accused Fox News host Bill O'Reilly of " historical fraud , " saying O'Reilly wrote about a hostile encounter between a reporter and Ronald Reagan in Killing Reagan that simply did n't happen . <p> In Killing Reagan , O'Reilly argues that the injuries from a 1981 assassination attempt permanently affected the Republican president . As evidence , he cites an 1984 confrontation at the Reagan family ranch where a befuddled Reagan was shouted at by ABC reporter Sam Donaldson , who O'Reilly depicts as a loud , boorish man who despised Reagan . According to O'Reilly , Reagan was so confused had to lean over and whisper the answer to the question . <p> Wemple points out there 's a slight problem with that telling , however : Donaldson was n't even at the ranch . " " I was n't there , " he told Wemple . " I was down in Santa Barbara with the rest of the press corps . " <p> managed to identify and track down the actual questioner , former CNN White @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite like that , " he chuckled when reading the exchange from Killing Reagan . Bierbauer denies that there was any hostile intent in his " shouting " at Reagan ; he notes that Secret Service kept them at least 70 feet away from the president , who was also known to be hard of hearing . <p> On Thursday , Wemple uncovered and published video of the encounter , which diminishes O'Reilly 's telling even further . The exchange does n't appear confrontational at all , and Reagan 's relunctance to answer Bierbauer 's question comes after he had already told the press he would n't be answering policy questions . There does appear to be one nugget of truth to Killing Reagan 's version of the story , Nancy suggests a generic response to the president under her breath , which Reagan repeats . <p> " Nancy 's prompting was the story , such as it was , " Bierbauer told Wemple in an email . " But O'Reilly is writing fiction . " @ @ @ @ <p>

His refusal to comply was the real reason he was released , according to Terricka . <p> " One things ( sic ) for sure I know my husband was told Not to take a Knee and he went with his heart and he took one , " Terricka Cromartie wrote .

According to a new Newsweek report , producers in the entertainment industry described him as someone who " was n't a hard get " because he would be in any movie as long as he could highlight his fame and wealth . To that end , they also described him as " incredibly pompous .

Here 's her quote : <p> When I met that man , I had a boyfriend , and he tried to become his friend to get my home telephone number . He got my number and he would call me to invite me out ... When I told him I would n't go out with him even if I did n't have a boyfriend , which he took as disrespectful , he called -- well , he would n't say he called , but someone told the National Enquirer ... I 'm not going to say who , because you know that whatever he wants to come out comes out in the National Enquirer . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because I was too short . <p> She said that he called her after the story came out and asked , " Can you believe this ? Who would say this ? I do n't want people to think this about you . " She claimed he wanted her to go out with him so that no one would think she was " too short . " <p> All of this was said to back up Hayek 's insistence that she believes the woman who are coming forward to claim Trump sexually assaulted them . <p> During her interview , she also lambasted the media for not paying enough attention to Trump 's promise that if he is President and Mexico wo n't pay for the border wall , he will freeze funds from Mexican-Americans to their families across the border , who use that money to eat . <p> She said , " That 's gravely serious .

Here 's Hall talking to CNN 's Dylan Byers about the film : <p> She pointed out that the focus of the film is not just Chubbuck 's final act , but rather , all of the things in her life that led up to it . She said that the movie is n't about Chubbuck 's death , but rather her struggle to live . <p> If you ca n't get to the movies this weekend , we can tell you a little bit about Chubbuck , who left an indelible mark on the broadcast news industry . <p> Born in Ohio and equipped with a broadcasting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the news world until she was employed at WXLT-TV .

She even wrote dialogue for whichever of her colleagues picked up the script . The technical director , however , did not keep the image of her body on the screen and no coworker ever got to read that script , which said something like , " TV 40 news personality Christine Chubbuck shot herself in a live broadcast this morning on a Channel 40 talk program .

" <p> James Dimos , the association 's deputy executive director , objected to the term " libel bully " and other sharp language in the report , saying in an Oct. 19 email that the changes were needed to address " the legitimately held views of A.B.A. staff who are charged with managing the reputational and financial risk to the association . " <p> " While we do not believe that such a lawsuit has merit , it is certainly reasonable to attempt to reduce such a likelihood by removing inflammatory language that is unnecessary to further the article 's thesis , " Mr. Dimos wrote . " Honestly , it is the same advice members of the forum would provide to their own clients . " <p> There were apparently some " minor edits " people in the ABA wanted made before publication . <p> However @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrote the report has posted it online here . Just to give you some idea of the tone , here 's how it opens : <p> Donald J. Trump is a libel bully . Like most bullies , he 's also a loser , to borrow from Trump 's vocabulary . <p> Trump and his companies have been involved in a mind-boggling 4,000 lawsuits over the last 30 years and sent countless threatening cease-and-desist letters to journalists and critics . <p> But the GOP presidential nominee and his companies have never won a single speech-related case filed in a public court . <p> They provide specific examples , including that infamous lawsuit he filed against Bill Maher . For those who do n't know , Maher made a joke offer that he would donate money to a charity of Trump 's choice if he produced his birth certificate to prove his father was not an orange-haired orangutan . <p> Trump apparently decided this joke was legally binding and filed a lawsuit . Here 's part of what the report says about that : <p> Trump has zero sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hilarious lawsuit ! He proved that much when he sued HBO Real Time cable television show host Maher for not making good on Maher 's joke that Maher would donate $5 million to charity if the orange-haired and orange-tinged Trump could provide a birth certificate showing that Trump was not the " spawn of his mother having sex with an orangutan " ... <p> Shortly after filing his frivolous lawsuit against Maher , Trump quickly withdrew it , and his lawyer said he would refile an amended complaint . He never did . <p> MEXICO CITY-- (

" <p> McCaughey criticized Fox host Megyn Kelly for pressing Newt Gingrich about said accusations . " I have enormous respect for how she runs her show . But I do believe the polls show that Americans are not buying this roll out of accusers and this bigger theme of man-shaming , and they want to get to the real issues , " she told CNN 's Don Lemon . <p> " The latest Fox poll shows ...

 another open letter from Amy Schumer meant to address some controversy she has stirred up . <p> Just a few days ago , she read a letter to a New York crowd that addressed the people who walked out of her Tampa comedy show when she started lobbing insults at Donald Trump . Her latest letter appears on Medium and focuses on the accusations of racism that stemmed from her reinterpretation of Beyonc ? ' s " Formation " video . <p> Following a thorough Twitter dragging that involved the hashtag #AmySchumerGottaGoParty , she released the essay which includes this : <p> It was NEVER a parody . It was just us women celebrating each other . The video Beyonc ? made was so moving and I would n't ever make fun of that . There is absolutely no way to . I make fun of myself a few times in the video as I do in everything I am a part of . I loved every second of working with those women to make this thing that lifted us up . <p> If you watched it and it made you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not my intention . The movie we made is fun and the women in it are strong and want to help each other . That 's what it was about for me . Of course I had Beyonc ? and Jay Z 's approval . They released it on Tidal exclusively for the first 24 hours . <p> You have every right to feel however you feel about the video and me but I want you to know I 'm not going anywhere . Use whatever hashtag you like . <p> She explained that watching Hillary Clinton at the DNC this summer inspired her to reimagine the video and song as telling all women to get in formation and that the goal was never to detract from the original themes of " Formation , " including a celebration of black history and a condemnation of police brutality . <h> EVENT <p> Three 
 campaign chairman John Podesta has released a statement in response to the FBI investigating new emails . <p> Here is the full statement : <p> Upon completing this investigation more than three months ago , FBI Director Comey declared no reasonable prosecutor would move forward with a case like this and added that it was not even a close call . In the months since , Donald Trump and his Republican allies have been baselessly second-guessing the FBI and , in both public and private , browbeating the career officials there to revisit their conclusion in a desperate attempt to harm Hillary Clinton 's presidential campaign . <p> FBI Director Comey should immediately provide the American public more information than is contained in the letter he sent to eight Republican committee chairmen . Already , we have seen characterizations that the FBI is ' reopening ' an investigation but Comey 's words do not match that characterization . Director Comey 's letter refers to emails that have come to light in an unrelated case , but we have no idea what those emails are and the Director himself notes they may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we would see something like this just 11 days out from a presidential election . <p> The Director owes it to the American people to immediately provide the full details of what he is now examining .

 has had vanity license plates for the past nine years featuring his last name is suddenly dealing with a whole lotta harassment over them . Why ? Because he happens to have the same last name as the Republican presidential nominee . <p> In a report by KATU in Oregon , Brian Trump discussed how over the past year and a half he 's been receiving more and more negative attention over his ' TRUMP ' plates . Brian , who lives in the suburbs of Portland , detailed how while he has gotten a couple of thumbs up , mostly he 's heard vulgar language and been flipped off on the road . <p> For the most part , he 's brushed off the anger he 's received with a good sense of humor . However , his good nature has reached its limits when his wife , who also has vanity plates featuring her last name , was recently tormented by three men who thought it meant she was a Donald Trump supporter . <p> " So you got three grown men yelling at a woman alone in her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scary . You do n't want something to happen . " <p> Brian Trump said that he will not take the plates off , though . Instead , he is going to put a sticker on his back window that says Trump is his last name and that he has better hair . <p> He did n't answer whether he was voting for Donald Trump this election , but said it should n't matter if he is or not . <p> " Even if I was a die-hard Trump supporter , why should there be potential threats of violence or vulgar language , " he explained . <h> Packers without Matthews 
 CNN 's Brian to his program Reliable Sources to decry the " plague of fake news " that has infested social media . The main point of the essay was to urge viewers to " triple check " their sources before sharing stories on Facebook and Twitter , noting how much damage the dissemination of hoax news articles presented as factual can do . <p> But the B.S. stories hurt the people who read and share them over and over again . Many of these fakes reinforce the views of conservative or liberal voters and insulate them from the truth . The stories prey on people who want to believe the worst about the opposition . <p> It was an admirable and much appreciated gesture by Stelter , fitting nicely into much of what he 's been saying over the past few months regarding the need to be truthful in today 's media climate . ( This has led to him getting embroiled in a feud with Fox News ' Sean Hannity after calling out the conservative host for pushing conspiracy theories . ) You can check out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ However , the same day Stelter delivered his message about fake news , his employer did something that should have infuriated and angered the media correspondent . Covering Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump 's Colorado rally Sunday night , CNN published an article claiming Trump encouraged supporters to vote multiple times . The only thing is , he did n't . <p> Roughly an hour after the article was posted , CNN stealthily edited the piece to change its headline and quotes from Trump , providing additional context and changing the entire premise of the piece . However , it would be more than an additional hour before CNN placed a correction note at the bottom of the article explaining the edits . <p> Meanwhile , the initial tweet with the original headline remained up for two and a half hours and was retweeted over 900 times before finally being removed . <p> Yet , we have n't heard anything from Stelter , despite this clearly being in his wheelhouse . <p> While Stelter has noted on his Twitter timeline that he 's taking most of today off , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brazile story , his own essay and other news items . Also , he did make an appearance on New Day this morning , where he and fellow media analyst Bill Carter discussed the disproportionate press coverage Hillary Clinton 's emails have received and , ironically enough , media and Trump rallies . <p> Now it is possible , perhaps even likely , that Stelter has not been made aware of this article and how CNN pushed a false narrative and then quietly tried to correct its mistake hoping no one would notice . However , at the same time , it is a bad look to make a concerted push for news consumers to pay extra attention to the facts on the same day your employer is exposed presenting a falsehood and then attempts to backtrack in a sneaky fashion . <p> The hope here is that Stelter will eventually use his critical voice to draw attention to this misstep by CNN and tell them they need to do better . A whole lot better . Otherwise , this will continue to feed into the perception , fairly or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Clinton .

 op-ed published by TIME Magazine Monday , attacking Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton 's handling of her private email server is an attack on womankind itself . <p> " I am mad , " writes Robin Lakoff , a professor of linguistics at UC Berkeley . " I am mad because I am scared . And if you are a woman , you should be , too . Emailgate is a bitch hunt , but the target is not Hillary Clinton . It 's us . " <p> " The only reason the whole email flap has legs is because the candidate is female , " Lakoff continues . " Can you imagine this happening to a man ? Clinton is guilty of SWF ( Speaking While Female ) , and emailgate is just a reminder to us all that she has no business doing what she 's doing and must be punished , for the sake of all decent women everywhere . " <p> Lakoff argues that criticizing Clinton 's emails was part of a Republican war on women , and amounted to criticizing Clinton for using a form of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be no scolding and no ' scandal , ' " she argues . " Those very ideas would be absurd . Men have a nearly absolute right to freedom of speech . " <p> " Since it 's a woman , doing what decent women should never do engaging in high-level public communication well , there must be something wrong with that , even if we ca n't quite find that something , " she continued sarcastically . " We will invoke the terminology of criminal law to account for our feelings . She 's getting away with treason ! Put her in jail ! " <p> All the highlights 
 with gun owners in North Carolina , Sen. Richard Burr ( R-NC ) joked that a picture of Hillary Clinton on a gun magazine may have been improved with a " bullseye on it . " <p> In audio obtained by CNN Monday , the vulnerable lawmaker , who is in a close Senate race with Democrat Deborah Ross , stated that nothing made him feel better than seeing the magazine with her photo on it . <p> The North Carolina Republican , locked in a tight race for reelection , quipped that as he walked into a gun shop " nothing made me feel better " than seeing a magazine about rifles " with a picture of Hillary Clinton on the front of it . " <p> " I was a little bit shocked at that it did n't have a bullseye on it , " he said Saturday to GOP volunteers , prompting laughter from the crowd in Mooresville , North Carolina .

 most popular things that the cable news nets have been doing over the last few days is rolling tape from the not-so-distant past of Democrats praising FBI Director James Comey for everything from his professionalism to his hunky good looks . At the time of course , Comey had wrapped up an investigation into Hillary Clinton 's use of a private email server and found no wrongdoing substantive enough to recommend charges to the Justice Department , so everyone from President Barack Obama to HRC herself to Nancy Pelosi sung Comey 's praises . <p> On July 7th , Maryland Rep. Elijah Cummings on the House Oversight Committee went full-on proud papa and said to Comey , " I do n't know whether your family 's watching this , but I hope that they are as proud of you as I am .

" I love that part , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's a love that a mother has for a child ! It 's a love that endureth forever , " he continued sarcastically . <p> The Clinton campaign has called for Comey to be more transparent after he wrote a bombshell letter to lawmakers Friday saying that the original investigation was being reopened due to new findings that " appear to be pertinent . " The findings come from the home computer of disgraced former New York Congressman Anthony Weiner , the estranged husband of Clinton 's top aide Huma Abedin. <p> According to a

 Ryan 's Days as Speaker of the House Could Be Quickly Coming to an End <p> According to a new report from The Hill , " chatter is growing louder , " that House Speaker Paul Ryan may soon be stepping down . <p> The embattled leader of the Republican Party has faced unprecedented scrutiny and pressure in his role trying to unite the fractured party and conservative movement amid the contestable candidacy of Donald Trump . Many have met Ryan 's game with criticism , and House GOP members are reportedly growing more certain that the 46-year-old Wisconsin pol will soon be out . <p> The Hill cites four members of the House who say that they expect Paul Ryan to step down after the election , " arguing that he faces a daunting path to the 218 votes he needs to win a full two-year term leading the House GOP .

 MSNBC host Rachel previewed elements of the new blockbuster story by Newsweek 's Kurt Eichenwald that details the deep-running connections between Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin 's Russia . Elements of Maddow 's segment and Eichenwald 's reporting support theories we 've heard tossed about before by the likes of Glenn Beck and others : that Putin 's chief efforts in Russia are to badly destabilize the global community ( including NATO ) , and help prop up the unpredictable and worrisome Trump candidacy in the process . <p> Eichenwald 's highly-anticipated Newsweek story was released Friday morning , detailing the extent to which Trump 's actions impacted Russian cyberattack efforts and their hopes of " weakening Western alliances . " The piece titled " Why Vladimir Putin 's Russia Is Backing Donald Trump " contains lots of intriguing information regarding the depths of the dynamic . Here are some of the most engaging points of Eichenwald 's original reporting : <p> At the first presidential debate at Hofstra , moderator Lester Holt pressed both Trump and Hillary Clinton to identify the threat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the DNC . Trump 's response ? " I do n't think anybody knows it was Russia that broke into the DNC . She 's saying Russia , Russia , Russia . Maybe it was . I mean , it could be Russia , but it could also be China , but it could also be lots of other people , it also could be someone sitting on their bed that weighs 400 pounds , OK ? " <p> Eichenwald notes that although Trump was briefed by intelligence officers about Russia 's efforts to interfere with the election , his public dismissal " alarmed several NATO partners because it suggests he either does not believe the information he receives in intelligence briefings , does not pay attention to it , does not understand it or is misleading the American public for unknown reasons . " <p> Many in the global community fear that if Donald Trump is elected , he could quite frankly continue to disregard key information shared by the intelligence community . He continued his laissez faire approach at the third debate , remarking , " Yeah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when faced with the reality of Russia 's involvement in the hacks . " Our country has no idea , " Trump continued telling Chris Wallace , shocking our NATO partners who were certain of Russia 's role . " But he blithely dismissed the conclusion of not only the United States but its allies as well , based on absolutely nothing . " <p> Trump 's attacks on the Khan family caused Russia to rethink its strategy <p> Donald Trump 's open combative rhetoric against a Gold Star family that spoke at the Democratic National Convention caused the Kremlin to essentially assume his candidacy was done . Trump 's language was viewed as so severe that Russia assumed he would be replaced as the GOP nominee . As Eichenwald writes , " the Kremlin assumed the Republican nominee was showing himself psychologically unfit to be president and would be forced by his party to withdraw from the race . " <p> In response , Russia puts its hacking efforts on hold , " ending the distribution of documents until Trump stabilized . " The hacks continued however once it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Republican ticket . <p> Later in the piece , he continued , " Top Russian officials came to believe Trump would be forced to withdraw from the race because of his psychological state and apparent unsuitability for the presidency . " <p> The connections between Trump 's inner circle and Moscow run deep <p> By now , it 's very well documented that former campaign manager Paul Manafort has a lengthy history of involvement with pro-Russian politicians in Ukraine ( he told a Ukraine crowd in 2007 , " I am trying to play a constructive role in developing a democracy . I am helping to build a political party " ) . Manafort may have received nearly $13 million from Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych 's Party of Regions as first reported by The New York Times . Additionally , Carter Page ( a former Trump advisor ) is alleged to have had back-channel discussions with the Russian government as recently as this summer . Though he denies any wrongdoing , Page is under investigation by both American and European intelligence as a result . <p> Even retired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's most vocal surrogates and a onetime VP contender , has dubious ties with Russia . Last year , Flynn attended the 10th anniversary celebration of Russia Today television ( RT ) , sitting two seats away from Putin himself , and " despite public warnings by American intelligence that the news agency is used for Russian propaganda , " Flynn attended anyway . <p> Kremlin propaganda has mysteriously wound up as Trump talking points <p> Trump and his campaign have long touted various reports that have materialized to be little more than Russian propaganda . " In one instance , " writes Eichenwald , " a manipulated document was put out onto the internet anonymously by propagandists working with Russia ; within hours , Trump was reciting that false information at a campaign rally . " <p> The Trump camp has also spread around information from the Russian outlet Sputnik identified as a " disinformation campaign " to American journalists . Trump 's spokeswoman Hope Hicks did not respond for comment . <p> Propping up Trump is good ; destroying Clinton is better <p> Eichenwald writes at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not so much to support Trump as it is to hurt the Democratic nominee . " Vladimir Putin was allegedly furious when Hillary Clinton as Secretary of State slammed Russian elections in 2011 as " neither free nor fair . " Enter Trump , who spoke glowingly about the Russian president , earning immediate favor . <p> Win or lose , Putin 's done his job <p> The Newsweek story reveals that even if Trump loses the presidential election , the disinformation campaign was a success . Even in the likely case that Clinton wins , " her administration would be bogged down trying to heal divisions within the United States brought about by releases and misrepresentations of hacked information . " <p> Was Trump getting ... too powerful for Russia ? <p> Eichenwald cites " buyer 's remorse " by the Russian government concerning the Republican nominee once they learned that he may be so unpredictable and unstable that his victory would spell out brutal uncertainty at the highest levels of diplomacy . " Russia came to see Trump as too unpredictable and feared that , should he win @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him or even anticipate his actions , " he writes . <p> Our Western European allies are preparing for the worst <p> Although they are stunned to admit it , officials in Western Europe , according to Eichenwald , are now compelled to gather intelligence on Trump himself , " but believe they have no choice . " The man 's rhetoric this year has indicated to many that he perhaps would have more favorable views of Putin 's Russia than our own NATO partners ; " should the United States , the last remaining superpower , tilt its policies away from NATO to the benefit of Russia , the alliance between America and Western Europe could be transformed in unprecedented ways , " he writes . A Trump victory next week could spell unprecedented fear in the global community with the potential to do " irreparable harm " to our longstanding alliances . <h> Today : The

 GOP Congress Should Get Rid of the Filibuster <p> Scott Walker thinks the new Republican Congress should get rid of the filibuster so that they and President Donald Trump can get their agenda through without procedural roadblocks . <p> He told Wisconsin radio host Charlie Sykes that he firmly believes that Trump wants to tackle big issues in his presidency and work with the Republican Congress . <p> And the filibuster , he thinks , would be a serious impediment : <p> " I think that would really upset the electorate of the people who not only elected Donald Trump and Mike Pence but the people who elected Ron here and elected other members of the House and the Senate .

 I 'm stunned . Not about the fact that Donald Trump will be our next President , a forecast I was universally ridiculed for when I made that very " crazy " prediction last summer . Nope , I 'm shocked at how nearly everyone in the media ( and for that matter , thousands of protesters across the country ) continue to underestimate , misinterpret and unjustifiably vilify our next President . <p> Given the backlash I felt for being a loud and proud Trump supporter in the past , I was hesitant to jump back in these waters again . But heck , why not , for one final time let 's dive in and get my objective assessment of Trump 's potential success on the record as soon as possible : Trump will make the office of the President great again ! You heard it here first . <p> Let me assure you that my vision of the forthcoming triumphant Trump presidency is not viewed through rosy orange-tinted glasses from deep in the heart of Trump country . In fact , as a New Yorker now living in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ media circles and in my daily real world encounters with literally only Trump haters . I was hopeful that after the election was finally over , the losing side would graciously admit defeat and be supportive of the victor . I was fully prepared to stop complaining about Hillary Clinton 's endless lies and corruption , since if she became President it would have meant she won the election fairly and that the issue was n't important to a majority of the country . She would have been the country 's President , she would have been my President , and the fight would have been over . <p> That is why I 'm genuinely shocked that after Trump 's victory , instead of allegations of him being a **28;1131;TOOLONG word du jour disappearing , they seem to have actually ramped up . In the aftermath of this election , I 've even humorously ( I think ? ) been compared to a Westworld robot several times , in the sense that just like how the robots on the popular HBO show are programmed not to hear or comprehend any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mine wonder if I 've been programmed to block out , what they describe as Trump 's " obvious and undeniable racism . " <p> Well , categorically ruling out the possibility that I 'm a robot is as futile as trying to change the opinion of many that some of Trump 's statements are unforgivable and in their mind , prove his bigotry . However , what I can propose is my belief that Trump 's actions as commander-in-chief ( as opposed to his often haphazard and trivial campaign rhetoric ) will protect and serve all Americans , regardless their background , sex or sexual orientation a result which should silence his critics , atone for perceived sins , and undeniably be great for America ! <p> Easily exceeding the insanely low expectations half the country expects from the racist caricature they dreamed up of him ( or more precisely , a caricature that has been largely media-generated ) is just one reason why Trump will eventually be perceived to be a great President . But here are several more reasons to prove it . Most significantly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no big donors , and honestly not even to the Republican party or any ideology whatsoever . This gives Trump the freedom to simply serve the American people , to compromise on deals with all players in Washington and to end the partisan divide that has recently been a roadblock to any progress . <p> Furthermore , when the wall along the Mexican border is built , it will be viewed as a rare moment when a leader delivered exactly what he promised . Will Mexico pay for it ? Unclear and ultimately irrelevant , since as long as Trump 's negotiations are visible ( and when does Trump desire doing anything that does n't generate attention for himself ) , then his supporters will be satisfied with the mere attempt . Ultimately , Trump 's private sector background of constantly needing measurable results combined with his personality of always needing to brag about some type of success , is further proof that Trump will never stop publicizing any achievements no matter how big or small , from renegotiated trade deals , replacing Obamacare , to boasting about his ever-increasing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the only one saying he did a great job as President , then I would n't hesitate to return right back here , admit my mistake and get behind a certain Missus who likes " to go high " to run a campaign against him . But betting against Trump is what nearly everyone did every step of the way during this campaign season , and I would n't recommend doing it again ! Stay tuned ! <p> -- <p> Matt Schneider is a .

 for election 2016 becomes more clearly refined , one of the hottest topics from a media perspective , has been the widespread dissemination of false information . Facebook in particular , has suffered the brunt of the criticism for allowing stories filled with factual inaccuracies to flood pages and misinform the public . How much blame Facebook actually deserves will certainly remain a subject for debate . After all , humans may be largely to blame for sharing error-riddled , often conspiratorial nonsense . <p> Not so for Google search which may be the single most important way people around the world gather information , have questions answered and are directed to websites . The " Google Algorithm " is a constantly evolving , jealously protected secret . Sure , Google offers benign tips on how to improve its omnipotent search results but the nuts and bolts of the methodology remain deeply under wraps . <p> So it is with that background , that I share this anecdote of searching in Google today for " Final Vote Count 2016 , " which I would assume is a fairly common search phrase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on why the anachronostic electoral college needs to be abolished , I wanted to review the latest numbers and update my piece accordingly . <p> The number one search result ( for this and other related searches ) in Google News was this story <p> from a site called 70News which appears to just be an individual 's WordPress site . The headline on the angry , conservative site blared in all caps : <p> Now , of course , I knew this could n't possibly be true because that would have meant that somehow the state of California , where many of the latest votes were still being tallied , had suddenly gone seriously red . To be clear , those numbers are not remotely accurate as shown here , here and here . Clinton has actually expanded her lead in the popular vote significantly ( my piece has been updated accordingly ) . <p> But if you were to rely on the number one search result on Google News , one would falsely believe that Trump was suddenly up by 700,000 votes <p> " #PopularVote : #Trump : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the numbers come ? Alas , the author anticipated that question and was armed with this response as of today , November 13 : <p> " Update : Anyone asking where I got the figures , it was from twitter posts . " <p> And the website 70News which shows up at the top of Google News search used " Michael " as its source . When Michael was challenged on Twitter about the source of his assertion , he linked to some nonsense about how absentee ballots are counted <p> While Michael can and will share whatever factually erroneous material he so chooses , the fact that Google , which typically is pretty good at sorting the news wheat from chaff , is promoting this site that uses Michael from Twitter as its source is a real issue . <p> 70News went on to explain why it is the only site with the ' real numbers . " <p> " Knowing the Democrat media have been dragging their liberal feet giving Michigan to Trump finally they did , with Arizona finally declared two days ago -- Trump now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the popular vote number still need to be updated in Wikipedia or MSM media which may take another few days because the liberals are still reeling and recovering from Trump-shock victory . If I 'm wrong , I wo n't hesitate to change the numbers . It 's the job of the establishment media to tell the people the final numbers when it 's out there already . " <p> The " establishment media " have , and will continue to do so ( see links above for a few ) . But he/she does n't want to hear that and instead wants to rely on Michael 's Twitter feed . Furthermore , he/she is apparently waiting for the numbers to be updated on Wikipedia which , of course , gets its information from users citing the mainstream media since it does no actual reporting . <p> We are entering a zone where even the hardest of facts become debatable ? in the minds of conspiracy theorists . But Google , you are effectively a computer program with none of that supposed media bias , so Google programmers please @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

The books came out after their personal drama ended and Fields , at least , believes that there are plenty of people out there whose view of the books was colored by the turmoil . <p> Both of them have terrible Amazon reviews and Fields has asserted that they are " almost identical " because they are from " Trump trolls who have n't read " the books . <p> Here are some of the reviews on Fields ' Barons of the Beltway : <p> Kelly 's book , Settle for More , only came out yesterday , but here is a review : <p> While the above review of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it still follows the pattern seen in reviews of Fields ' book : it mentions Trump 's feud with her instead of addressing the book 's content . <p> We already reported on the horrendous reviews of Fields ' book earlier this summer , but it 's the fact that Kelly 's book has n't even been out for two days yet that makes this particularly noteworthy .

 to believe that it has been nearly 22 years since the first Bad Boys film was released , but the buddy cop flick starring Will Smith and Martin Lawrence is still a favorite among movie goers . The original was so popular that the two teamed up with Michael Bay and Jerry Bruckheimer in the height of the CSI fandom in 2003 , providing a grittier ( and far more bombastic ) sequel to the original ( the scenes of Lawrence accidentally downing Ecstasy and the undercover bust of a KKK rally alone are worth the price of admission ) . <p> All these years later , it 's still a constant source of questioning for the stars : any plans for a third ?

 at Carly Fiorina for Director of National Intelligence <p> The New York Times reported Monday that Republican president-elect Donald Trump was considering former primary opponent Carly Fiorina for the nation 's top intelligence post . <p> " Mr. Trump will meet on Monday with Carly Fiorina , the former Hewlett-Packard chief executive , to discuss the job of director of national intelligence , " The Times reported , citing a senior transition official . <p> If selected , Fiorina would be the first female director . She would also be the first director with no prior government experience , although she was the chair of the informal CIA External Advisory Board under the Bush administration . <p> Fiorina 's selection would be unusual given the lingering bad blood between the two following the primary race .

 to understand why the story was so popular . It has Santa , a terminally-ill boy , a final Christmas gift , a dying wish , and an extremely emotional and compelling witness in Schmitt-Matzen who looks like the perfect modern television version of Santa Claus . When I first heard about it , being the father of a four-year-old girl to whom Santa is currently almost everything , I was prepared to be choked up by the whole sad affair . <p> Instead , I had a very different reaction . <p> At first , I found myself stunned that the story had gotten such remarkable coverage with an extraordinary lack of details and corroboration . Then , as I delved deeper into how the original column had quickly exploded nationally , I became extremely confused as to how to make sense of it all . Now , I have several questions that should have been asked and answered before this Internet sensation had been given such remarkable news media coverage . <p> I want to make clear that I am not saying that the story is hoax , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Santa " says that it did . I am , however , willing to say , perhaps because of the lightning speed with which the story worked its way up the media food chain , that it does possess almost all the markings of a possibly " fake , " or at least partially fake , news item . At the very least , the follow-up reporting here has been extremely poor . <p> First , let 's take basics of the original story . It began as a column ( not a news story ) in a rather small newspaper in Knoxville . The first half of the column does n't even mention the boy but instead reads like an advertisement for Schmitt-Matzen 's Santa Claus business . Okay fine , so the writer , Sam Venable , buried the lede . That 's weird , but it does n't prove anything . <p> However , the column which is heavy on emotion , is almost completely lacking in facts of any kind . Here are the following key bits of information which are missing from the story and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in by any follow up reporting : <p> The date this happened ( a subsequent interview with Venable indicates it was " about a month ago , " but he clearly does n't know ) . <p> The name of the nurse who called Schmitt-Matzen urging him to rush to the hospital to see the dying boy . <p> The name of the hospital . <p> The name ( even a first name ) of the boy . <p> The name of the family . <p> A statement from anyone else who was there ( according to Schmitt-Matzen there were many witnesses ) , or anyone else at all , including his wife who seems to have been out town during a key portion of the story . <p> Now it is certainly possible that Venable , being a columnist who was never expecting the story to break nationally , decided that none of these facts were important enough to overcome possible privacy concerns . However , there are other aspects about how this all went down which raise even more questions . <p> There are several parts of both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which simply do n't make sense . Here are some of them : <p> Is n't early November in Tennessee a bit early for a dying child to be obsessing about Santa so much that a nurse decides to take it upon herself to rush St. Nick to the hospital ? And if Santa was rushing to the hospital on no notice in early November , how is it that the parents had a wrapped Christmas gift ready for Santa to give him ? <p> Does it not seem odd that the parents of an imminently terminal five-year old would allow him to be totally alone ( as Schmitt-Matzen makes clear happened ) with a complete stranger ? Also , I 'm not a doctor , but it seems odd to me that a boy could be well enough to meet Santa , have a very cogent conversation with him , and express joy over having received a gift , all just seconds before dying ( of an undisclosed illness ) . And where are the medical personnel while this is all happening ( none are mentioned by Santa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ detail that as soon as the boy died he immediately rushed out of the hospital , which , while certainly plausible , is consistent with a storyteller who wants there to be an explanation for why no one remembers him being there ( it should also be noted that , because he was in such a big hurry to get to the hospital , he was apparently not in full Santa garb , which is also extremely convenient . ) <p> How Venable found out about the story also seems strange . As he discusses in a video interview about the story having gone viral , he got wind of this in a whisper-down-the-lane situation which included at least four degrees of separation from Schmitt-Matzen . In all my years of interviewing people I have NEVER found a story which had more than one degree of separation from its source to be fully credible . <p> The fact that , in this era of instant news , it took several weeks for the story to come to the attention of anyone in the media should inherently raise concerns . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never seen a similar story which took that long to get reported where there were n't significant problems with the narrative . Even more interesting is that Venable talks about how tough it was to get Schmitt-Matzen to talk on the record about his experience , and even suggests that at one point " Santa " almost backed out from doing so . <p> Venable , who seems to have not ever seriously questioned Schmitt-Matzen 's veracity , appears to have been , understandably , blown away by the deep emotion expressed by " Santa . " Whenever a reporter gets hooked into the emotion of a story and leaves their skepticism at the door , there could be issues . <p> The indisputable reality is that the only person who has spoken on the record about this episode is the same guy who makes a living pretending to be someone he 's not , and who will now be able to charge a lot more money for his services . <p> This is exactly the type of story which the news media would be VERY hesitant to debunk , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being wrong ( you went after Santa , you asshole ! ! ) far outweighs the reward for being right ( gee , thanks for ruining Christmas , you asshole ! ) . <p> Both me and a Mediaite editor have searched for every Knoxville obituary ( on the Knoxville News Sentinel 's own website ) in the key portion of November , and have so far found no sign of anything close to a five-year-old boy dying . <p> For the record , I have emailed multiple editors at the Knoxville News Sentinel asking to speak to Venable and have not yet received a response . <p> Again , I 'm not saying that this story is a hoax . Maybe it is simply exaggerated due to the long delay between the event and its reporting , and by Schmitt-Matzen really getting deep into his character , while never thinking the story would go much beyond Knoxville . Perhaps the story is completely true and has just been very poorly reported and involves a lot of extremely media shy people . <p> I 'm also not saying that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is n't 100% true . However , with " fake news " now being rightfully such a hot topic , it would be an important " teaching moment " for how easily the news media can be duped into buying a possibly false narrative , especially when so many emotional hot buttons are pushed at the same time . <p> As usual , I just want the truth and it feels to me that on this one we might need to know more . <p> This copy is

The Sleep Revolution author , who this year left her namesake HuffPo for Thrive Global to further focus on the importance on sleep , was discussing the impact that a good night 's sleep has on positive decision making .

" So I think it 's absolutely fine . " <p> The rest of the Morning Joe panel beat up on Deutch the way he deserved .

In the video , Rye is seen being patted down by a TSA agent at an airport and the security check appears to be very aggressive . <p> At one point , though Rye is standing in the public space and wearing the sort of dress that would be perfectly at home in an upscale office , the agent appears to attempt to lift her skirt . Rye asserts that her genitals were touched twice at this time . In the final seconds , she looks to be on the brink of tears . <p> Here is a Periscope video from after the screening in which she explains the situation . She said that while she is not a victim of previous assault , she worries what sort of effect that sort of touching could have on one .

She swatted away unsolicited advice and asserted repeatedly that she did not set off any beeps when going through the initial scanner . <p> Rye says she has sent the video to the top of the chain of command at the TSA in an effort to get a statement and prevent this from happening to others . <p> At least one

" <p> However , when it came to how he would respond to Russia over the cyberattacks , his answer may have left a lot to be desired for many . <p> " Our goal continues to be to send a clear message to Russia or others not to do this to us because we can do stuff to you , " POTUS stated . <p> He added , " But it is also important for us to do that in a thoughtful methodical way .

" I see it as a welcome sign that he will be open to alternative views and even to critics . " <p> The 2012 republican Presidential nominee indicated that he was bound by a sense of duty to the country to speak with the President-elect about joining his Cabinet . <p> " I was indeed very critical of Donald Trump during his campaign , " Romney said . " But now he has been elected president and accordingly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the country I love , I would have been more than willing to do so . " <p> Romney wrote his letter in response to a Salt Lake Tribune editorial which sharply criticized him for softening or reversing many of his criticisms about Trump in order to potentially be tapped as Secretary of State . <p> " The best case for Romney would have been remaining consistent to his anti-Trump screed and eventually acting as a check on the new president 's hubris , " the editorial said .

 ' Becomes The New Weapon Of Mass Destruction <p> In 2004 , during my freshman year in college , I remember turning on the presidential debate between President George W. Bush and Senator John Kerry . <p> At the time , I was a novice , just dipping my toe into the political water for the first time . Within Bush 's first two answers , I was forever progressive . <p> Immediately , I studied up on the failures of intelligence and journalism that led us into the Iraq War ; the taking anonymous intelligence officials word hook , line , and sinker ; the dereliction of broadcast and print outlets to prominently feature anti-war critics ; the seize and destroy mission to label anyone who doubted the intelligence or mission as " anti-American " ; and the total vacancy of investigation into whether Bush and Halliburton Inc. -- excuse me -- Dick Cheney , had any semblance of an exit strategy . <p> 13 years later , it took one week for the the New York Times , the Washington Post , CNN , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time about Russia . <p> " There 's a perception that you 're letting President Putin get away with interfering in the U.S. election , and that a response that nobody knows about or a look-back review just do n't cut it , " Josh Lederman of the Associated Press began his question to President Obama at his final press conference . <p> " Are you prepared to call out President Putin by name for ordering this hacking , and do you agree with what Hillary Clinton now says , which is that the hacking was actually partially responsible for her loss ?

" <p> This is n't a revolutionary question . This is n't even that smart of a question .

According to the sources , the tapes ( and the accompanying audio ) were not part of the actual pageants , rather they involved backstage , behind-the-scenes filming for social media and other promotional purposes . <p> According to four sources , attempts were made by Trump opponents to contact editors and production staff who used to work for the Miss Universe Organization , but they were unresponsive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the Trump Organization requires all of its staff to sign are legendarily tough , leading many to stay silent out of fear of being sued by the famously litigious Trump . <p> It was also reported that Trump critic Mark Cuban reached out to Ari to get a hold of the tapes , only to be told " My brother is in politics , I 'm not . " <p> The Beast also noted that while Ari Emanuel donated money to Hillary Clinton , as did employees of his company , the amount was way lower than in both the Obama campaigns . After winning the election , Trump met with Ari at his New Jersey golf course , where he was conducting interviews for Cabinet spots . <h> News Local <h>

 Hayes reported on the comments made by Turkish assassin Mert Altintas in the aftermath of his murder of the Russian ambassador Tuesday , but curiously left out the fact that he yelled " Allahu akbar " " God is great " in Arabic . <p> " The gunman was Turkish , a 22-year-old officer in the Ankara special forces , " the All In host said . " According to witnesses , the gunman yelled out , ' Do n't forget Aleppo , do n't forget Syria , ' wounding three additional people before being fatally shot by police . " <p> Video of the shooting is readily available online , and shows that Altintas immediately yelled " Allahu akbar " after firing the shots . While nearly all outlets included that fact in their reports on the shooting ( including MSNBC earlier in the day ) , Hayes did not . <p> Hayes ' was the only primetime MSNBC show to omit the phrase from its reporting entirely and/or not show the video of the shooting .

 host Joe Scarborough ripped into Bill Clinton Tuesday after the former president made a series of comments blaming " angry white men " and other external factors for Donald Trump 's victory over his wife Hillary Clinton . <p> Scarborough was especially peeved by Clinton 's insistence that his wife only lost because America had entered a " post-truth " era . " Oh , my god . This coming , Mika , from the man that said it depends on what your definition of ' is ' is , " he recalled . <p> " I would ask if he has no shame , but he proved decades ago that he did n't , " Scarborough said . " If the Clintons would just get out of the way and be gracious about this , there would be people carrying their water . " <p> But it was the " angry white men " comment that annoyed Scarborough the most . " Those ' angry white men ' that Bill Clinton is talking about are the same ' angry white men ' that got him elected president and the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for months that the Clintons were n't reaching , " he noted . <p> CARY , N.C.-- 
 a humorist who specializes in creating short videos revolving around politics and the media , announced earlier this week that he was taking a break from Twitter due to an onslaught of online attacks accusing him of pedophilia and leading a child sex ring . <p> Berger is pointing to Mike Cernovich , owner of the website Danger and Play and one of the leading voices in the alt-right movement , as the main culprit behind these attacks . Cernovich , coincidentally , was also one of the loudest voices when it came to pushing the crazed #Pizzagate conspiracy theory which claimed members of Hillary Clinton 's inner circle were involved in child prostitution . <p> Will be off Twitter until this is settled . This is serious &amp; horrifying . involved . Have to protect my family . <p> It appears that Cernovich and Berger began actively feuding on Twitter last month after Berger posted a video poking fun at Cernovich . At one point , Cernovich blocked Berger from following him , leading the online satirist to ask his followers to call on Cernovich to unblock him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ write @Cernovich and ask him to unblock me. 1st amendment is very important . Thanks ! <p> However , the beef got more intense last week when Cernovich received a couple of messages making what he called " pedophilia jokes " regarding a photo of him holding his baby . <p> The alt-right provocateur did some online investigating and noticed that the users who sent him the insulting messages followed Berger and had received responses from Berger on Twitter in the past . Following that , Cernovich started directing suggestive tweets Berger 's way , seemingly claiming that Berger was actually at the center of a child sex ring and urged followers via videos and tweets to to keep an eye on Berger and his followers . <p> Berger created a compilation of Cernovich 's videos showing the suggestive ways he implied Berger and his followers were involved in pedophilia . <p> For his part , Cernovich is stating that he never called a pedophile only that he was hanging around pedophiles . Speaking to The Daily Beast , he noted that Berger needs to take ownership @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vic told his followers to message me , and some of his followers sent me the most revolting pictures . He has to take ownership of what his followers do when he tells them to message me , " he said via direct message . <p> " Vic misrepresented what I said . I never said he was a pedophile . I said he 's palling around with and associating with them . He pals around with pedophiles his own followers . You can see he has interacted with them on Twitter . Why does Vic associate with that ? Why did n't Vic apologize when the very same people he told to message me sent me that stuff ? " <p> When asked if he should be responsible for his followers do , Cernovich merely said that they " would not jump to the wrong conclusions " because , as he claimed , " I am careful with my words . " <p> However , as Berger highlighted , it is obvious that many of Cernovich 's followers are absolutely accusing him of pedophilia . <p> Berger also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ libeling him , disputing his claims that he did n't call him a pedophile . <p> " He knew exactly what he was doing . I saw that he backtracked last night and said he ' was very careful not to call me a pedophile . He never called me a pedophile . ' True ! He called me the leader of a pedophile ring , " said Berger . That 's even worse . And he encouraged his followers to come after me . " <p> Referring to Pizzagate , Berger thinks Cernovich has a " weird hangup with pedophilia " and wonders why he constantly falls back to " calling people pedophiles . " <p> We have reached out to Berger for comment on this story and will update with his comments if we hear back . <p> UPDATE 10:30 PM ET : Berger responded back , telling us that " it 's been a horrible past few days " and he 's " looking forward to moving past this . " He also noted that it appears that Cernovich " already has since he 's now accusing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Mike Cernovich using the fact that he just had a kid himself as a weapon to try to damage other people 's reputation is pretty disturbing to me , " he added .

 turned to Trump , Bee explained that the new political reality requires people to work together if the president-elect is ever to be confronted when necessary : <p> " I think that our future is going to require a broad coalition of non-partisan decency . It 's not just individual people against Donald Trump , it 's all of us against Trumpism . " <p> Beck said that he agreed , but he also explained that he does n't want to see anyone damage the country by fostering political divides like he used to . Beck also pointed out how Bee has become a " catastrophist " like himself , nudging her to admit her view out loud that Trump will turn America into a freedom-crushing dictatorship . <p> In the end , Bee and Beck solidify their new friendship the only way they could in their situation : by eating a " strange bedfellows " celebration cake . <p> Angry young men 
 Of Its Whole Comments Section <p> Comment sections are special places . Those who frequent the comments at one particular outlet get to know one another and there is often very intense discourse . From what we hear , it can involve name-calling and the occasional ban , but people surely still come away from their encounters having had their minds opened to new ideas and having learned something important . We ca n't be totally sure . It would be hard to look through all of the comments during an average day of writing , but we 're positive that everyone says really kind things about each one of the Mediaite writers individually and collectively . <p> Apparently , the commenters at Vice were not being kind . The site 's explanation for yanking the comments section is a barnburner lite that should be read in its entirety : <p> Unfortunately , website comments sections are rarely at their best . Without moderators or fancy algorithms , they are prone to anarchy . Too often they devolve into racist , misogynistic maelstroms where the loudest , most offensive , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reasoned responses drowned out in the noise . While we always welcomed your thoughts on how we are actually a right-wing mouthpiece for the CIA , or how much better we were before we sold our dickless souls to the gods of capitalism , or just how shitty we are in general , we had to ban countless commenters over the years for threatening our writers and subjects , doxxing private citizens , and engaging in hate speech against pretty much every group imaginable . <p> After that send-off , they addressed the " hot , brilliant non-bigots " who used the comment section to promote real discourse . Vice promised them that Facebook comments , tweets , and even physical mail will all still be read going forward . <h> Ottawa pledges overhaul 
 panel tonight turned into a shouting match during a debate about the search warrant used to obtain Hillary Clinton emails in that probe of Anthony Weiner 's laptop . <p> John Flannery , who said there was no probable cause for the warrant , took a shot at Donald Trump as a " man-child . " When guest host Jesse Watters scolded him and said " It 's President-elect Trump to you , " Flannery responded , " No , not to me ... He 's not my president-elect . " <p> When Dan Bongino started to speak , he told Flannery that he 's " completely embarrassing " himself . Flannery pushed back , Bongino told him not to interrupt , and Watters broke things up by telling Flannery , " We 're gon na have to cut your mic a la O'Reilly if you do n't shut your mouth . " 
 angry with Hillary Clinton now that they 've practically turned their " Least Influential People of 2016 " list into a testament to her failure to win the election . <p> Described as " a comprehensive , anger-fueled list of everyone who ruined our year , " the article states that Donald Trump 's victory did n't occur from his efforts alone , but also because of the " boobs , liars , and hapless idiots " who got involved in the election . While writer Drew Magary said he hated putting Clinton on the list after she won the popular vote , he had no choice but to rake her across the coals : <p> " When you lose an election to Donald Trump , you belong on this list . How do you fuck that up ? ? It 's Donald Trump ! I genuinely doubt whether that man can tie his own shoes , and he still beat her . Would it have killed you to visit Wisconsin , Hillary ?

I 'll be 80 and on my deathbed and my kids will be around me and I 'll beckon them closer and , in my final moments , I will whisper these words like a secret : " I ca n't believe she lost to that asshole . " <p> Magary was n't done there though , not by a long shot . He went on to name and shame a whole bunch of people who made Trump 's rise possible in their own unique capacities . <p> Here 's part of what Magary wrote for Anthony Weiner : <p> You idiot . You breathtaking , unbelievable idiot . Do n't even talk to us right now . Do n't even look at us . You should just go lock yourself in the pantry and stay there until we tell you to come out , which will be never . <p> And here 's a glimpse of Tim Kaine 's segment for you : <p> Do we know where he is ?

 no fan of Donald Trump 's . He 's also known for his sharp tongue- he 's never been one to hold back or mince words . During the campaign , when he was asked if he would ever have dinner with the GOP nominee , his answer was " Absolutely f*cking not . " <p> He sat down with Eater 's Helen Rosner on December 19th- the day the Electoral College voted the President-Elect into office , dashing anyone 's hopes that it would go the other way . He talked about his concerns ( his daughter , mostly ) whether or not he 'll move ( he wo n't ) , and the future of his show , Anthony Bourdain : Parts Unknown ( " I 'm just going to keep doing what I 'm doing . It 's about the story " ) . <p> They also discussed the fact that restaurateurs are still opening in the Trump Hotel in Washington , D.C. , which Jos ? Andres famously pulled out of , resulting in a lawsuit and countersuit . Not surprisingly , Bourdain is n't interested in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , he told Rosner , " I 'm not going . I 'm not going . " <p> Another place he 'd never go ? <p> The White House Correspondents ' dinner though I doubt there will be another . Thank god , that 's an institution I 'd like to see die for years . If there 's one good thing to come out of the Trump administration , let it be that there will be no more White House Correspondents ' dinners . It reinforces all the world 's worst notions about the hideous , inside-the-beltway , all-in-it-together culture . It brings honor to no one to have Kim Kardashian or Tara Reid sitting there next to a news anchor . What is this all about ? Fuck that . If I 'm gon na make fun of you today , I 'm not accepting your food tomorrow . I had dinner with President Obama , but I paid . We were offered Air Force One , and I said , " There 's no way . No way . " <p> There 's lots more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head over to Eater. <p> In hindsight , 
 against the idea that conservatives must take the side of cops , even when they 're in the wrong . <p> All week , we 've been talking in one way or another about the sort of unity that reaches across traditional party lines . Now that a video of a cop arresting a woman after she tried to report that her seven-year-old had been choked by a white man has gone viral , some of that particular brand of unity is on full display . <p> Red State 's senior contributor , Ben Howe , went off about the six-minute clip on Twitter . He was especially furious that the officer had asked the mother if she 'd taught her child not to litter after she had told him that he had been choked . <p> He began his tweetstorm by quoting a tweet from Joy Reid , a media personality whose work could easily be described as the exact opposite of Red State 's . <p> Stopped watching after the cop asked her why she does n't teach her 7 yr old son not to litter in response to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left-leaning public figures like Reid who are quick to jump on and condemn videos like this . Howe referenced that and seemed equally incensed by the idea that conservatives ca n't care about police brutality as he was about the brutality that appears to be shown in the video . <p> And I KNOW people on " my side " do n't want to hear this . But this shit simply would n't have happened to me. https : <p> It is still too early to know whether his predictions about who , exactly , will defend the officer in the video are true , but it 's worth noting that Howe advocated for a unification against police brutality from the beginning . <p> Nowsch had pleaded 
 unclear when the video in question was filmed , CNN has reported that Amri was caught on camera as he swore allegiance to ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi . This development comes amid breaking news about how Amri was shot and killed by Italian authorities this morning , bringing an end to the manhunt launched to find him . <p> Paul Cruickshank noted that the video was prerecorded before the attack , meaning that Amri might not have known exactly what would happen after he drove into the shopping Berliners . Cruickshank also said that the news is relevant to the previous discovery that Amri was previously investigated as part of a probe on an ISIS recruitment ring in Germany . <p> The development comes days after ISIS took credit for the massacre on their media networks . Reuters reported on the video itself , saying that Amri also used his video to call on other Muslims to " kill the crusader pigs , each person to their own ability . " <h> Canada in favour 
 whether Trump 's anger was directed towards an online article or a segment on TV . Nonetheless , it is worth noting that NBC has an article containing Trump 's quote in full , and Politico noted that the network reported on the same complete quote at multiple points in their recent TV broadcasts . <p> Trump 's nuclear comments have caused a firestorm of concern and questions over the past few days , particularly after he went on to suggest that he would " let it be an arms race " on nuclear proliferation . <h> Merry Christmas :

 you ask , fake news is either rampant or not a problem at all . Facts either do n't exist or are the absent element that newscasters need to do their best to inject into the national conversation . For the people who run popular fact-checking site Snopes , fake news is nothing new , but it 's definitely seen an intense renaissance lately . <p> The site 's managing editor , Brooke Binkowski , said this in an interview with the New York Times : <p> Rationality seems to have fallen out of vogue . People do n't know what to believe anymore . Everything is really strange right now . <p> Her site is 20 years old and long focused on urban legends about razor blades in Halloween candy and various celebrity death hoaxes . During the 2016 election , though , it became the de-facto fake news buster as conspiracy theories about Hillary Clinton 's health , the intentions of Muslims on Twitter , and so much more abounded . <p> Lately , conspiracy theories and fake news about Snopes and its founders have been emerging , too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back on falsities no matter what . <p> " At least until someone shows up at my workplace and kills me , " she said . <p> In light of a man firing a weapon in a family restaurant after reading and wanting to " investigate " a fake news story , that statement holds more weight than ever . <p> Vera Rubin , 
 Abrams sat down with Megyn Kelly tonight for an extensive two segment discussion of the implications of a Trump presidency for the media . <p> Abrams said that in Trump 's world , if you criticize him " you 're the enemy . " He gave Kelly due credit for setting the standard for how members of the press should respond when Trump attacks . <p> Kelly recalled how she had to have security around her after getting that criticism and warned that she was lucky because she works at a company like Fox -- -- someone in a less fortunate position might not be so lucky . She said , " It would have real First Amendment implications . " <p> Abrams was particularly alarmed about Trump " punishing certain media organizations because they publish things you do n't like " and " marginalizing the media as a whole . " <p> He distinguished between something like Trump criticizing the New York Times which he seemed to think was fair game as opposed attempting to marginalize the media as they exercise their role as a check on presidential power . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a vis the president , " he told Kelly , " is scary stuff to me .

 politics editor Sam Stein argued on MSNBC 's Morning Joe Wednesday morning that President Barack Obama shoulders much of the blame for his party 's historic losses during his eight years in the White House . <p> Stein suggested that Democrats may be overanalyzing the 2016 election loss . " They ended up with 2.8 million more votes for their candidate . It was 80,000 votes in three states that really cost her , " he said . <p> " But then on the other hand , you look at the destruction of the Democratic Party under Barack Obama 's leadership and you have to wonder ; what was the political what were the electoral benefits that he gave to the party ? " he argued . <p> " He leaves them in a much worse position , " Stein noted . " The states are decimated , they lost control of the House and Senate , the governorships are decimated .

The Israeli Prime Minister expressed his ire for the Obama Administration in a response shortly afterwards , attacking Kerry 's " unbalanced " speech and saying he does n't need to be " lectured " by foreign leaders . <p> During a recent slam on President Obama , Trump asked Israel to hold on long enough for him to rectify the " total disdain and disrespect " they have seen from America 's 44th president .

 host of CNN 's Parts Bourdain called out elite East Coast liberals in an interview with Reason , saying that their " utter contempt " for working-class Americans was unhelpful and nauseating . <p> Bourdain , himself a liberal , is highly critical of Donald Trump . " Wherever one lives in the world right now I would n't feel too comfortable about the rise of authoritarianism , " he said . " I think it 's a global trend , and one that should be of concern to everyone . " <p> That said , Bourdain was equally critical of his peers for paving the road to Trump . " The utter contempt with which privileged Eastern liberals such as myself discuss red-state , gun-country , working-class America as ridiculous and morons and rubes is largely responsible for the upswell of rage and contempt and desire to pull down the temple that we 're seeing now , " he argued . <p> " I 've spent a lot of time in gun-country , God-fearing America , " he continued . " There are a hell of a lot of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else in this world is trying to do : the best they can to get by , and take care of themselves and the people they love . When we deny them their basic humanity and legitimacy of their views , however different they may be than ours , when we mock them at every turn , and treat them with contempt , we do no one any good . " <p> " The self-congratulatory tone of the privileged left just repeating and repeating and repeating the outrages of the opposition this does not win hearts and minds , " concluded Bourdain .

 Talking Points Memo fame is an equally well-regarded and well-known journalist in our industry ; he boasts a Twitter account of 164K followers ( with an indefatigable 113K tweets to his history ) on left-of-center issues , but is hardly known as a sharp provocateur . <p> So imagine the shock that swept across the faces of people in the world of political media late Friday night when Marshall tweeted out a PornHub link called " Angela &amp; Strawberry .

" Josh Marshall responded directly : <p> The piece from Louis the Trump transition team alleging that President Obama 's sanctions against Russia this week were done , " to quote ' box in ' President-elect Trump , " as Conway put it , instead of punishing the Kremlin for election interference . <p> Marshall 's satiric ( I guess ? ) response , then , was the PornHub link that quickly was shared and heavily-debated .

 has decided once again to tweet about his disdain for CNN . Today 's tweets are somewhat unusual however , because instead of criticizing the network 's reporting as per usual , Trump decided to complain about the photo used on the network 's new book about the election <p> @CNN just released a book called " Unprecedented " which explores the 2016 race &amp; victory .

 the hosting duties for Monday 's NHL Winter Classic on NBC . Part of those duties , in the pregame festivities , included an introduction of hip hop star Nelly , who was to perform for the crowd in St. Louis 's Busch Stadium . <p> And based upon his intro , it is entirely reasonable to conclude ( perhaps even declare a certainty ) that Bob Costas had never heard of Nelly prior to Monday afternoon .

Wilkins then grabbed what appeared to be Samuel 's right buttock , then reached again and seemed to grab Samuel 's gentials . <p> The referees apparently did not notice the act , the play was not penalized . Samuel got right back up and stayed in the game , as the next play was run almost immediately with the Buckeyes in the no-huddle . <p> Following the game , Wilkins admitted culpability . <p> " I was being silly and I apologize for that , " said Wilkins , Hale of ESPN . " It 's stuff you do when you 're competing , and I know that 's not a good look . I apologize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the game . There were no hard feelings . " <h> Turkey Mourns As 
 earlier today , Fox News ' Sean Hannity traveled to London to speak with WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange for an exclusive in-person interview . <p> While Hannity will present the interview tomorrow evening and then show additional parts throughout the rest of the week , we do have some bits available now . <p> In response to why he thinks the Obama Administration took a dramatic response to the allegations that Russia hacked the election , Assange had the following to say : <p> " Our publications had wide uptake by the American people , they 're all true . But that 's not the allegation that 's being presented by the Obama White House . So , why such a dramatic response ? Well , the reason is obvious . They 're trying to delegitimize the Trump administration as it goes into the White House . They are trying to say that President-elect Trump is not a legitimate President . " <p> The WikiLeaks head also said that his source for the hacked DNC and John Podesta emails were not " the Russian government and it is not a state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a radio interview . <p> As for whether he thought WikiLeaks was responsible for the outcome of the election , Assange gave this response : <p> " Did it ( WikiLeaks ) change the outcome of the election ? Who knows , it 's impossible to tell . But if it did , the accusation is that the true statements of Hillary Clinton and her campaign manager , John Podesta , and the DNC head Debbie Wasserman Schultz , their true statements is what changed the election . " <p> Additionally , Assange stated that Obama was acting " like a lawyer " regarding the Russian hacking allegations and has n't specifically said WikiLeaks obtained the information from Russia . <p> Stay tuned for video of Assange 's comments , which will be added to this post when available . The interview will be shown tomorrow at 10 PM ET and Mediate will be there to cover it . <h> Show 2 more 
 released an unsettling selfie video to state media , and it shows the man who they believe was responsible for killing 39 people as he celebrates the new year at an Istanbul nightclub . <p> Anadolu Agency reported on Turkey 's continued efforts to find the shooter , and as part of their TV broadcast , they released a 44-second video that they said was taken by the alleged killer . The footage shows the scowling suspect in a black hooded jacket as he walks through Taksim Square , a popular tourist destination near the heart of Istanbul . <p> ABC reports that at least 14 have been arrested in connection with the attack that left scores of people dead and wounded inside the Reina nightclub . The manhunt continues for the suspect in the video , though reports state that the police have information about the killer 's fingerprints , and that he left his jacket and weapon at the club before he escaped . <p> Who : 32 
 month or so , there have been three embarrassing and major corrections on three separate pieces from The Washington Post , all of which were critical of president-elect Donald Trump and his flirtation with the Russians . <p> First , there was a much-belated correction to a November story which uncritically passed along the accusation that the Russian government was behind the explosion in fake news during the 2016 presidential election . One of those groups making that claim was PropOrNot , which maintains a list of media sources that they believe are proprietors of Russian propaganda . That propaganda effort , they claim , was designed to elect Trump . <p> The problem is , that list was very , very flawed and the " experts " who curated it are completely anonymous . Posting only one story that merely aligned with Russian interests was enough to earn a spot on their list . Media outlets that ended up tarred as Russian propagandists were incensed . <p> Editor 's Note : The Washington Post on Nov. 24 published a story on the work of four sets of researchers who have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American democracy and interests . One of them was PropOrNot , a group that insists on public anonymity , which issued a report identifying more than 200 websites that , in its view , wittingly or unwittingly published or echoed Russian propaganda . A number of those sites have objected to being included on PropOrNot 's list , and some of the sites , as well as others not on the list , have publicly challenged the group 's methodology and conclusions . The Post , which did not name any of the sites , does not itself vouch for the validity of PropOrNot 's findings regarding any individual media outlet , nor did the article purport to do so . Since publication of The Post 's story , PropOrNot has removed some sites from its list . <p> Let 's get the obvious out of the way : yes , there is a remarkable irony in the fact that the WaPo expos ? on fake news turned out to be based on unverifiable claims . <p> But I have to say , I do n't quite understand WaPo 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's claims without vouching for them . There are untold amounts of self-proclaimed and anonymous experts dwelling on the internet hawking claims that may or may not be true . When a prominent newspaper picks one of those theories and repeats it without noting competing arguments or the holes in their theories , the inescapable conclusion is that the paper believes those theories have merit . <p> Put another way : suppose The Washington Post passed along the bogus claim that Hillary Clinton murdered a DNC staffer , based on a shadowy group 's say-so and without noting the considerable evidence against that theory . Would anyone really argue they were n't actually accusing Clinton of being a murderer ? Or would the " just asking questions " defense be seen as the sham that it is ? <p> After the story went to print , Burlington Electric said in a statement that they had indeed found Russian malware on one of their computers . But the computer was not connected to the electrical grid , which remains secure . The utility company 's statement came only an hour and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unclear how much of an effort the authors made to contact them beforehand . Disturbingly , the other Vermont utility company mentioned in the piece tells Forbes they were not contacted by WaPo about the story until after they went to print . <p> Despite their initial failure to contact the actual parties involved , WaPo was sure to get Trump 's take before they went to print . Spokesman Sean Spicer told them it would be " highly inappropriate to comment " before they were briefed . <p> And here we arrive at the heart of the matter : both stories were about Russia , but really of course they were about Donald Trump . " President-elect Donald Trump has repeatedly questioned the veracity of U.S. intelligence pointing to Russia 's responsibility for hacks in the run-up to the Nov. 8 election , " the hacking story notes . PropOrNot likewise gasped that , " Russia was running a super PAC for Trump 's campaign . . ? . ? . It worked . " Even if they had n't been so explicit , both stories on phantom Russian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ received criticism for his denial of other alleged Russian activities in the U.S. <p> We could add a third embarrassing correction here : a WaPo column that denounced Trump 's pick for OMB Director for being too inexperienced , in part for having never served on the House Budget Committee . Had the author or her editors spent three seconds on Google , they 'd have discovered that Mick Mulvaney actually had served on that committee . Oops . <p> I do n't believe there 's a vast liberal media conspiracy out to defame Donald Trump ( because there 's no evidence of that : see how that works , WaPo ? ) . But when a series of major mistakes happen and every erroneous piece was politically damaging to the president-elect , I think it 's fair to question whether editors and reporters are letting their personal feelings about Trump ( and by extension , the Russians ) get in the way of healthy journalistic skepticism . And when they all happen in one newsroom ... <p> At the very least , it 's fair to ask why there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the evil Russians back when the Republican nominee for president was highly critical of Vladimir Putin , and was mocked by liberal editorial pages for declaring Russia our number one geopolitical foe . There sure seem to be a lot more now that the de facto head of the Republican Party is Putin 's greatest admirer and Obama 's shelved the reset button . Perhaps it 's a coincidence that coverage shifted at the same time conventional progressive and conservative opinions did a 180 . Perhaps not . <p> Whatever the reason for these mistakes , they only hamper the paper 's credibility when they report on the real troubling stories about Trump and Russia and believe me , there are plenty . The journalistic shortcuts and mistakes that led to these corrections are easily fixed ; for the sake of the paper and the public alike , here 's hoping they are . <p> This is an opinion piece . The views expressed in this article are those of just the author . @ @ @ @ @

 by Gallup reveals that the American public is n't all that sold on President-elect Donald Trump 's ability to handle the duties of his soon-to-be office . <p> Using a sample size of over a thousand adults and conducted December 7-11 , the survey found that only 46% of respondents feel confident Trump can handle an international crisis . And this was before his recent tweets about the United Nations , Israel and North Korea , among other foreign policy issues . <p> Another question that was asked was if Trump could prevent major scandals in his administration . Only 44% said that they were confident he could . For comparison 's sake , the average for the incoming Clinton , Bush and Obama administrations was 76% confidence . <p> Another area where Trump was unable to get even a slight majority to express confidence in him was regarding whether he 'd use military force wisely , with only 47% feeling he would . <p> The area where voters felt most confident in Trump was his ability to work effectively with Congress to get things done , with 60% stating their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into office with Republicans holding power in both the House of Representatives and Senate . <p> Today , with 
 , Whoopi Goldberg took aim at Bill O'Reilly on " The View , " singling out comments he made on " The O'Reilly Factor " the night before . O'Reilly had accused Hollywood as a community of engaging in " reverse McCarthyism " to scare musicians from performing at Donald Trump 's inauguration by branding his supporters as " bad people . " O'Reilly claimed that " a number of entertainers believe their careers will be harmed , should they associate with the new Trump administration , " a situation that he branded " an awful state of affairs . " <p> " If you do n't vote for people who do n't support you probably wo n't get turned down as much , " she said . " I know that one of the people that supported Donald Trump was Ted Nugent . So , why is n't Ted Nugent performing ? He 's one of your big supporters . " Panelist Jedediah Bila did n't necessarily agree with O'Reilly invoking McCarthyism , but she did cite conservative entertainers who had told her they were afraid to be public about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Goldberg pointed out that a big part of Trump 's issues in finding inauguration performers has been his team going after liberal performers and not conservatives in the first place .

Do n't go after the people who clearly did not support you and label them as being bad . " <h> Cabot Oil &amp; 
 a Weekly Show Instead of a Nightly One <p> TBS is planning to rework Conan and turn it into a weekly show instead of a nightly one , according to a report from TheWrap . John Martin , CEO of Turner confirmed it and cited competition in the field as one of the reasons for the shift . Late night TV is better than ever , and thanks to the Internet , more people are seeing lots more of its content . <p> Martin also said that weekly will be a better format for the show . Recently , host Conan O'Brien has traveled for several of the episodes , including trips to Cuba and South Korea . The out of town episodes have boosted the show 's ratings , and with a weekly format , he 'll be able to do more of that . Weekly late night shows have become more common recently .

 Feel Invited Artists Should Perform at Inauguration Even if They Do n't Want To <p> There has been quite a bit of discussion about the lack of A-list talent that President-elect Donald Trump will have performing at his inauguration . It was reported last month that his team was desperate to get some big names to show up . Meanwhile , Trump himself took to Twitter to deflect the issue , saying he wants " the people " and that A-listers were trying to get tickets . <p> Regardless , with the inauguration two weeks away , there are no stars lined up to perform . With that in mind , Morning Consult ran a poll asking voters if they believed celebrities and entertainers should be obligated to perform if invited . And , the responses fell largely along partisan lines . <p> While the majority of all respondents felt that artists should not perform at the inauguration if they did n't want to , 53% of Republicans believed the following : <p> " Celebrities and artists should perform at the inauguration if invited ; the country needs to come together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turning down invitations to make political statements only furthers the divide and disrespects the person who won the presidency . " <p> As you can see from the above poll results , only 15% of Democrats felt artists should be obligated to perform , compared to 77% who thought they should have the freedom to decline . <p> Views on individual performers and groups such as KISS , Celine Dion , Elton John and Justin Timberlake who have declined invitations also fell along partisan lines , with Republicans saying their declines made them have a less favorable opinion of the artists and Democrats seeing them in a more positive light . <p> Streaming became the

He went on to call himself " the ratings machine , " and even go as far as to bash Schwarzenegger for his previous political alliances . <p> Trump made no reference however to the fact that he is still serving as Executive Producer for the series .

 interview that raged on for the better part of twenty minutes this morning , CNN New Day anchor Chris Cuomo sparred with Kellyanne Conway of the Trump campaign on a wide variety of controversies , foremost of which has been the President-elect 's willingness to seemingly discredit our own intelligence community . <p> The senior Trump advisor took issue with the fact that talk of the " alleged " Russian hacking ( as she puts it ) is being conflated with why Hillary Clinton lost , a claim that Conway put at the feet of CNN itself . " Your network is doing it constantly , " she told Cuomo . At times , two continued to spar even over the basic premise of questions asked due to Conway 's effective filibustering . <p> " I 'll ask you a third time !

" <p> " You 're ducking the obvious , " he said , " and I do n't know why . " <p> At one point , when the New Day anchor alleged that Trump was " sheltering Russia , " Conway defiantly shot back , " Do n't you say that again . " <p> The best part of the hit ( in my estimation , anyway ) comes when Cuomo repeatedly tried to bait Conway into simply including Russia among those foreign entities that should not hack or interfere with the United States . She refused to name the country on its own , saying instead we reject interference , " by anyone . By anyone .

 Are Dumb &amp; Dangerous , Regardless of Who the Victim Is <p> By now , most people have heard of the horrific abuse which four people in Chicago inflicted on a male with special needs , live on Facebook . Part of what made this story so noteworthy is that the alleged crimes were committed by black people against a white person , with statements which were made during the horrendous episode indicating that the acts were at least partially racially motivated . <p> I was curious to see if the perpetrators would be charged with so-called " hate crimes " because normally those laws are used to increase the penalties for crimes committed against members of a minority group , not BY a member of a " protected " class . In this case , those charged have indeed had the " hate crime " designation added to the other charges against them . <p> As a white guy who was skeptical that in a politically correct world blacks would be treated the same way whites would be under similar circumstances , part of me was pleasantly surprised that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equally and fairly . However , a bad law is still a bad law , regardless of how equitably it might be implemented . <p> In my view , hate crime laws are both dumb and dangerous and this case , partially because of its " man bites dog " quality , further proves this reality . <p> To me , the biggest problem , among several , with hate-crime laws is that they force the criminal justice system to read the mind of the perpetrator of a crime . Sometimes this may seem rather easy to do , but usually it is not so clear why someone decided to harm another person . <p> But even when we are reliably able to discern a motive which is particularly egregious to society ( like racial animus ) , the bottom line is still that we are punishing someone for their thoughts and not their actions . There is no more slippery slope than between " hate crime " and " thought crime , " and while the former has now become accepted within American jurisprudence , the latter concept goes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> When you start punishing someone for their thoughts or beliefs in the name of political correctness and in an effort to make society feel better about itself , there is simply nothing to stop that model from ultimately effectively ending free speech . Hate crime laws are the " loophole " in the First Amendment which will eventually render it powerless . <p> In order for freedom of speech/thought to have any real meaning we must be willing to endure all expression , no matter how repugnant , and not give in to the tempting siren song of those who think that we can somehow end racism by simply increasing the punishment for crimes which appear to be racially motivated . Hate crime laws are simply the vehicle through which liberals who naively think the world can be a perfect place , have sold out one of our most cherished rights , all in the name of feeling better about ourselves when faced with the most horrific acts of humanity . <p> There is just no need for the " hate crime " classification . A crime is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the act , not the which may have motivated it . <p> Then there is the problem of who gets " hate crime " protection . This is another slippery slope with no logical end . As the Chicago case shows , this can often create strange and confusing situations . <p> Was the victim here targeted because he was " white , " or was it because he has " special needs " ? Was the condemnation of Donald Trump during the taping of this alleged crime an indication of racial animus against whites , or that the culprits really dislike Republicans ( or perhaps those who pretend to be Republicans ? ) . <p> In our increasingly grievance-oriented culture , the limits on what groups of people who can plausibly claim extra legal protection under hate-crimes laws is almost literally only restricted by one 's own imagination ( there is also little doubt that when someone is part of a " protected " group that they are far more likely to perceive any negative act against them only through that prism , which then creates the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ violent crimes at least partially motivated by " hatred " of some kind ? What difference does it make whether the " hate " was driven by which demographic the victim belongs to ? <p> My final objection to hate crime laws is one that never gets mentioned in this debate . That is the complete demonization of " hate " as motivation . Yes , often times , as apparently was the case in Chicago , " hate " is a horrible human emotion , but this is not always true . We forget that , among many examples , had we not " hated " our enemies in World War II that we likely would have lost that conflict . Sometimes " hate " can be an extremely productive sentiment and it is clear that , partially through the acceptance of the " hate crime " concept , the word has now taken on a universal and extremely negative connotation ( as proof , try to remember the last time sports announcers described a good healthy rivalry with the word " hate " ) . <p> So , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " hate crime " under the current law , that only further illustrates how illegitimate these types of penalties really are . <h> Brad Gushue curls 
 <p> In the wake of the deadly shooting at Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport Friday , some have latched onto a particularly baffling gun control proposal : banning guns from checked luggage . The proposal is based on the fact that shooter Esteban Santiago checked his gun in Alaska , before pulling it out of his luggage in Florida . <p> The Associated Press wrote a piece titled " Airport Shooting Raises Questions About Guns in Baggage . " " Transportation Security Administration rules prohibit guns in carry-on bags , but they allow passengers to ship guns if they are unloaded , put in a hard-sided , locked container that only the owner has the ability to unlock , and placed in a checked bag ... " they note . " That means gun owners ca n't get to their weapons during a flight but can easily retrieve and load them after claiming their checked bags . " <p> CBS likewise ran a breathless segment on the rule allowing guns in baggage . In it , Florida Democratic Congresswoman and former DNC chief Debbie Wasserman Schultz hinted that she may push @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take a hard look once and for all at the unsecured areas of our airports , " she told CBS , as the narration noted that she " plans to review security procedures with TSA leaders . " <p> To me , this all makes no freaking sense . Checked luggage is only accessible once passengers are in public areas that anyone can walk into . You could pull out a gun from your luggage in baggage claim and open fire . But you could also just walk in and open fire . <p> AP 's aviation security expert even told them as much . " What 's to stop him from driving to the airport , parking his car , getting his gun and going into the airport and shooting people ? " he asked . Nothing in the remainder of the piece rebuts that very basic question . <p> A ban on carrying guns in checked luggage would have had the exact same effect as existing Florida law designating airport terminals a gun-free zone . Which is to say , it would have none . As best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the nation 's most prominent lawmakers are pushing for a rule that does n't actually do anything to prevent airport shootings . <p> While banning guns from checked luggage would do nothing to stop shootings , it would do a lot to inconvenience people trying to lawfully move their guns from one state to another . Mailing guns is a cumbersome process that requires working with a licensed dealer or collector . Driving requires working out which states and cities will reciprocate and recognize your license , at risk of being thrown in prison . For many , flights are the easiest and only feasible option . <p> But now those lawful gun-owners will be inconvenienced further for the sake of the desperate need to do anything in the wake of the Friday shooting , even if the benefits are illusory . I understand the need for action , but this proposal in particular makes no sense at all . 
 <p> Last night , after Meryl Streep ripped into him during her Golden Globes speech , President-elect Donald Trump spoke with the New York Times ' Patrick give his response . Besides stating that he was " not surprised " because Streep was a Hillary Clinton supporter , and stating that he never mocked a reporter for his disability , Trump also made the following observation about whether celebrities would be attending his inauguration . <p> " We are going to have an unbelievable , perhaps record-setting turnout for the inauguration , and there will be plenty of movie and entertainment stars , " Mr. Trump said . " All the dress shops are sold out in Washington . It 's hard to find a great dress for this inauguration . " <p> Well , this apparently comes as a surprise to shopkeepers in the Washington-area , who state that they have plenty of gowns on hand still . <p> Definitely not , said Martha Slagle , vice president and general manager of the Neiman Marcus in Friendship Heights . If a ball attendee were to walk in today @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to choose from , " she said , noting that the store stocks up every four years in anticipation of inauguration demand . <p> Slagle also laughed when told of Trump 's comment , stating that she was " stuffed with beautiful gowns . " Smaller stores like Ella Rue said they " always have dresses " and would only be sold out if " a thousand people came in today . " <p> One boutique owner told the paper that she could n't imagine the city 's shops all selling out , saying that D.C. is a " bigger city than people think . " <p> There was some reaction on Twitter to Trump 's claim : <p> Why FALSELY state inaugural gowns sold-out in DC ? Certainly not good for local biz which bring in xtra gowns for the event . 
 <p> Note : This post has been republished from May 19th , 2012 -- Tucker Carlson 's Fox News program is debuting tonight at 9 PM ET , going head to head with old rival Rachel Maddow so we are revisiting their old battles . <p> Watching the prim , polished Rachel Maddow show as it exists today -- MSNBC 's flagship it 's hard to recall the days Rachel Maddow was a radio host first and foremost , with some gigs on TV on the side . Her first regular stint on national television was on The Situation with Tucker Carlson a news opinion program that preceded both Wolf Blitzer 's The Situation Room and Jersey Shore 's Mike " The Situation " Sorrentino , and eventually became simply Tucker , giving way to a series of programs before ceding the 9PM MSNBC spot to Maddow herself . <p> This series will take a look at some of the most exciting discussions/debates on that program . In this five-part series , we watch as a less experienced but still savvy Maddow plays the combative guest to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the horserace election politics . <p> In this installment of our ongoing series , the topic du jour is the latest Osama Bin Laden tape , in which Carlson finds a number of suspiciously talking points . Maddow is livid at the idea that Bin Laden 's threat to attack America is somehow being used to attack the Democratic Party . The two are reviewing a previous segment on the matter from Scarborough Nation , where Carlson and Joe Scarborough made the point that the comments in the Bin Laden video were quite similar to those made by Democratic frontrunners for President ( for 2008 ) . " It blew my mind that that was your take on it , " Maddow notes , to which Carlson asks , " is n't it uncanny ? " He adds the caveat that he is " in no way comparing , " but does n't get through the sentence without Maddow exclaiming that this is ridiculous . " I literally expected him to say Hillary in 08 !

" " I 'm actively angry that this is being turned into a political attack on Democrats , " Maddow argued , to which Carlson , still smiling , joked , " it is an acknowledgment that Osama is stealing your best lines . " <p> The segment on Bin Laden ends with Maddow and Carlson laughing as she shouts " I 'm mad at you ! " at him , which is a pretty good indication of the regular tone of the program 's segments when they debated each other . 
 <h> Corinne is Naked 30 Minutes into Episode 2 of The Bachelor <p> On tonight 's episode of The Bachelor , 12 of the women get invited on a group date where they all get dressed up in some sort of bridal or bridesmaid outfit for some reason and do a photo with Nick . Themes included Vegas , a " shotgun " wedding that involved both a pregnant belly and a shotgun , and someone 's costume was really just leaves covering her nether regions with no top . <p> This did not sit well with Corinne , who does n't seem to know where she is at times . She 's totally jealous that Nick is talking to and interacting with the other women , despite the fact that she literally signed up for a show that involves dating the same guy that more than 20 other women are also dating . <p> As you might imagine , it also does not sit well with Corinne when Nick kisses another girl . <p> So , what does she do ? She decides she 's also going to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're only 30 minutes into episode 2 . <p> Anyone want to place bets on this season 's villain ? Corinne got the rose on the group date too , which is n't going to help her cause , although we 're betting she 's going to give us the classic **29;878;TOOLONG line " I 'm not here to make friends " any moment now . 
 <p> " Trump Just Dismissed the People in Charge of Maintaining Our Nuclear Arsenal , " reported Ashley Feinberg , who wrote for Gizmodo 's sister site Gawker before its shutdown . " According to an official within the Department of Energy , this past Friday , the President-elect 's team instructed the head of the National Nuclear Security Administration and his deputy to clean out their desks when Trump takes office on January 20th , " she wrote . <p> Trump , she continued , " appears determined to immediately push out everyone who was appointed by Obama , regardless of whether or not he has anyone in line for the job . Or , as our source put it : ' It 's a shocking disregard for process and continuity of government . ' " <p> The piece was widely shared , but Gizmodo soon added a large correction to the body of the piece . It turns it 's not at all true that Trump told the NNSA appointees they had to leave , he just never asked them to stay . <p> Another NNSA official , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disputed this report as " inaccurate " while confirming that " there have been no discussions between the president-elect 's transition team and any of NNSA 's political appointees on extending their public service past Jan. 20 . " In other words , the Trump transition team has not asked the top two NNSA officials to stay on until they can be replaced . <p> After speaking to our source for clarification , we have updated the story and headline to reflect that , while Klotz and Creedon have submitted their resignations , intend to depart on January 20 , and have not been asked by the Trump transition to stay past that date , the Trump team has not explicitly instructed them to leave or " clean out their desks , " as we reported . According to our source , both officials " have expressed to the Trump team that they would likely be willing to stay to facilitate a smooth transition , if asked , " as is the tradition for key officials , and have received no response . <p> The headline has likewise been updated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Charge of Maintaining Our Nuclear Arsenal .

 <p> Seth Meyers kicked off a new year of Late Night on Monday , and the show 's first order of business was taking a " Closer Look " at Donald Trump 's need to seemingly tweet about every little thing in the world . <p> Even though Trump 's top priority is to focus on his upcoming presidency , Meyers noted that the mogul has managed to find time to get on Twitter and complain about trivial matters like the new Celebrity Apprentice and what Meryl to say about him . Meyers found it amusing that Trump could retaliate by calling Streep " overrated , " when her Sunday night appearance was based on her lifetime of achievements in entertainment . <p> " She 's so good , " Meyers said , " people use her to compliment people in other professions . Like LeBron James is the Meryl Streep of basketball , or Donald Trump is the Meryl Streep of having thin skin . " 
 <p> Jockeys , by their nature , live life on the run . One former Thoroughbred rider in England kept on living that way even after hanging up his tack -- leading police on a wild chase as he posted pictures and even a video taunting them . <p> UPDATE 6:04 p.m . ET It turns out the charges , in fact , did n't amount to much more than a speeding ticket . According to a report in The Gazette , McMenamin was charged with " driving while disqualified " and driving without insurance . He was fined a total of ? 235 , and is forbidden from driving for three months . 
 <p> According to a report from NBC News , president-elect Donald Trump was not actually briefed on the unsubstantiated memo alleging links between the Trump campaign and Russia , and officials brought the two-page summary of the memo to his briefing to serve as an example of " disinformation . " <p> " Intel and law enforcement officials agree that none of the investigations have found any conclusive or direct link between Trump and the Russian government period , " a senior official told NBC News . The reason they brought the memo , the official told them , was to provide examples for Trump of the difference between " analyzed intelligence and unvetted ' disinformation . ' " According to the official , they never had to use it . <p> The NBC report appears to contradict the Tuesday CNN report , which broke news of the memo 's existence . CNN reported that the memo was " presented " to Trump , and the reason for its inclusion was to " was to make the President-elect aware that such allegations involving him are circulating among intelligence agencies . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assertions from Trump and Kellyanne Conway that Tuesday night was the first time they heard about the document . <p> According to NBC , intelligence chiefs also brought along examples of " disinformation " about Hilllary Clinton to present if they had to , but never did . 
 <p> In his first press conference in over one hundred days , Donald Trump indirectly addressed some of the more salacious details of the unconfirmed memo released by Buzzfeed Tuesday , denying they ever happened . <p> A reporter asked Trump if he had ever done anything in Moscow he later regretted and that the Russians could use to blackmail him . Trump responded that he was " extremely careful " whenever he traveled abroad because of his high profile . In particular , he stated that he never trusted hotel rooms in places like Russia not to have secret cameras . <p> " I told many people , be careful , " he said , " because you do n't want to see yourself on television . Cameras all over the place . " <p> He then indirectly denied the most inflammatory of the accusations , which included a hotel bed and generous amounts of body fluid . " Does anyone really believe that story ? I 'm also very much a germaphobe , by the way , believe me , " Trump said to laughter . 
 <p> Congressman Cedric Richmond , the current head of the Congressional Black Caucus , had some pretty strong words in response to the placement of his testimony and others during a Cabinet nomination hearing today . <p> The confirmation hearings for Senator Jeff Sessions , Donald Trump pick for Attorney General , continued , featuring testimony from Richmond , congressman and civil rights icon John Lewis , and Senator Cory Booker ( it was of particular note that Booker decided to testify against his own Senate colleague ) . <p> But Richmond made the following argument about their testimonies being placed at the tail end of the confirmation process : <p> " I want to express my concerns about being made to testify at the very end of the witness panels . To have a senator , a House member , and a living civil rights legend testify at the end of all of this is the equivalent of being made to go to the back of the bus . " <p> At one point in his testimony Richmond implored senators to " be courageous or be complicit " in what Sessions will do as AG. 
 <p> Buzzfeed 's decision to publish a 35-page dossier containing unverified allegations about President-elect Donald Trump has come under criticism by personalities at all three of the major cable news networks . New York Times executive editor Dean Baquet , likewise , disagrees with Buzzfeed 's decision to publish the allegations in full . <p> In a New York Timesreport published Wednesday , writers Sydney Ember and Michael M. Grynbaum called Buzzfeed 's move to publish , " a break from typical journalistic practice . " And the Times 's executive editor , calling the allegations " totally unsubstantiated , " said that he refused to publish a document that the Times could n't stand behind . <p> " We , like others , investigated the allegations and have n't corroborated them , and we felt we 're not in the business of publishing things we ca n't stand by , " Baquet said . 
 <h> Buzzfeed Is Selling ' Failing Pile of Garbage ' Shirts Now <p> During a long-awaited press conference today , President-elect called Buzzfeed a " failing pile of garbage . " That was about three hours ago . They 're already selling merch branded with the phrase . <p> There are t-shirts , bumper stickers , and even an actual garbage can . <p> The whole online shop got a bit of a makeover and has a splash header announcing their Trumpian rebranding : <p> Trump prides himself on being a savvy businessman , so surely even he would be impressed by this quick profit-seeking turnaround . <p> UPDATE 5:07 p.m . EST : <p> It has been brought to our attention that the proceeds from this are now going directly to the Committee to Protect Journalists , which is the same organization Meryl Streep encouraged donations to during her Golden Globes speech . <p> All proceeds from purchases of BuzzFeed 's limited-edition " Failing Pile of Garbage " merchandise will go to the Committee to Protect Journalists .

 <h> Greta Van Susteren to Pelosi : ' Who 's in Charge of the Democratic Party ' After Obama Leaves ? <p> Greta Van Susteren , a former Fox Newser now anchoring on MSNBC , spoke with Nancy Pelosi tonight and asked her about the state of Democratic leadership once Donald Trump is sworn in . <p> She asked , " After January 20th , when President Obama leaves the White House , who 's in charge of the Democratic party ? " <p> Pelosi talked about herself and other congressional leaders playing a major role , but Van Susteren said there should be someone in charge of building up the party . Pelosi countered that the Democrats won more votes overall across the country . 
 <p> The worst kept secret right about now in Washington is that Democratic Senator from New Jersey Cory Booker is already beginning his 2020 campaign or so many allege by targeting the confirmation hearings of the incoming Attorney General Jeff Sessions . <p> Booker , who just so happened to find himself in New Hampshire recently , openly challenged Sessions Wednesday in a splashy display , asserting , " In a choice between standing with Senate norms and standing up for what my conscience tells me is best for our country , I will always choose conscience and country . " It marks the first time in history that a sitting Senator is openly testifying against one of his Senate colleagues ; flanked by the Congressional Black Caucus , Booker called out Sessions ' record on social inequality and voting rights . He continued at one point by uttering a line that should be said at all confirmation hearings in my opinion : " The arc of the moral universe does not just naturally curve towards justice . We must bend it . " <p> But despite the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what it is Thursday : " Calculating . " <p> " Has anybody seen anything as calculated , as obviously calculated as this ? " he asked his morning panel , expressing disbelief that the Garden State pol would angle in such a way . <p> Mike Barnicle quipped , " Wrong venue , wrong time . " <p> Scarborough alleged that the feeling of Booker being opportunistic was shared by many over in the Beltway on Wednesday who watched the 47-year-old former Newark mayor attacks Sessions ' record . " There was a collective groan that went up during that . Very calculated and a lot of senators irked , especially on the Democratic side . " 
 <p> In an interview with the Associated Press , Vice-President Joe Biden stated that he and President Barack Obama were briefed about the unsubstantiated dossier that alleges Russia attempted to make efforts to compromise President-elect Donald Trump . The VP also noted that the reason the intelligence chiefs brought it up to them last week was due to concerns that the information could go public and surprise the White House . <p> According to Biden , Obama wanted to know why this info was included in the briefing because it did n't appear to have " anything to do with anything . " They were then told by the intel heads that " you may hear about it " and that they were also going to inform Trump of it . <p> The Veep added that the chiefs were unable to say if the allegations included in the dossier were true and that he and Obama did n't ask for any additional detail on it , as the purpose of the briefing was to go over the report ordered on Russian interference in the election and this was " totally ancillary . " 
 <p> The end of the world is coming . Whether you believe that or not , an old Italian prophecy has come true recently , and it was believed to be a sign that the Apocalypse is upon us . <p> More than 500 years ago , 16th century philosopher and " Italian Nostradamus " Matteo Tafuri foretold that snow would fall two days in a row in the Italian seaside region of Salento . Tafuri warned that when this happened , " Salento of palm trees and mild south wind , snowy Salento but never after the touch . Two days of snow , two flashes in the sky , I know the world ends , but I do not yearn . " <p> Salento typically enjoys a mild climate where residents say " it never snows , " but this week , The Sun reports , the town observed two consecutive days of snowfall . Southern Italy has been experiencing unusually cold temperatures recently , but local schools were reportedly closed , and superstitious observers and conspiracy theorists have been bringing up Tafuri 's prediction . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but Inquisitr noted that people have been concerned about warning signs that Campi Flegrei might soon erupt . Camp Flegrei is one of Italy 's biggest volcanos , and scientists have projected that the devastation a full-scale eruption could cause would be tantamount to a meteor impact . <p> Anyone who suggests that Tafuri ever made mention of Donald Trump would be distributing fake news . 
 <h> ' Denial of Real News ' : CNNers Go Off on Team Trump After New Report on Intel Briefing <p> If you were wondering how CNN would proceed after being trashed by President-elect Donald Trump and his advisors this week , the first 15 minutes of tonight 's AC360 should make it very clear . <p> The quartet of Anderson Cooper , Jake Tapper , Jim Sciutto , and Jim Acosta ( the reporter who Trump fought with ) went all-in criticizing the Trump team 's reactions to their network 's initial reporting about the 2-page synopsis the president-elect was briefed on . <p> Kellyanne Conway in particular disputed that -- in part by citing reports from elsewhere -- but with CNN supplementing its reporting tonight , Cooper called out Conway for " misleading on two points " in their contentious back-and-forth last night . Cooper again made it clear that CNN 's reporting was separate and distinct from BuzzFeed 's ( and they did not link directly to BuzzFeed 's report with that dossier full of unverified allegations , even though Conway told Cooper they did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that heads should roll at CNN if their report turns out to be wrong , and then he said this : <p> " Given what 's happened today ... it seems like that 's a better question for her . I agree with Kellyanne Conway . If we were wrong , we would admit it . But we were not wrong . She was . The question is will she hold herself and her team to the same standard ? " <p> And that was just the tip of the iceberg , because when Cooper brought his colleagues on , Tapper observed that " this has been the modus operandi for President-elect Trump and his team , to say what they believe to be true even if it is disputed by facts , and then stick with it ... It 's a fact-free campaign . " <p> All four men talked about how their network 's reporting has been bolstered not just by the follow-up tonight , but by Vice President Joe Biden and DNI head James Clapper , and Sciutto expressed his concern that Trump " went out with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There 's something worse than fake news and that 's the denial of real news ... They 're just not in command of the facts . This has been a pattern for the Trump campaign and now the Trump transition where they do n't like the news that 's being reported and they go after the messenger . " <p> Sciutto also brought up the issue of " a hostility to facts ... and a concerted effort by Donald Trump and his team to call into question the very existence of facts , the very existence of non-partisan news . " 
 <p> According to a new Quinnipiac poll , 18 percent of of voters feel Congress should fully repeal Obamacare. 47 percent would like some parts of the ACA to be cut and 31 percent state they want the entire law to stay intact . <p> On whether President-elect Donald Trump should support efforts to repeal the law , the public was divided . 48 percent feel he should back Congressional efforts to ax Obamacare while 47 percent think he should n't . <p> When drilling down on the results , it predictably fell along party lines . 86 percent of Republicans believe Trump should support the Obamacare repeal while 78% of Democrats want the incoming POTUS to oppose the efforts . 49 percent of independents do n't want Trump to back a repeal compared to 44 percent who do . 
 <h> In Defense of Buzzfeed 's Publishing of the Trump Dossier <p> Two days ago , I wrote that Donald Trump has somehow , against the odds , pulled off another victory against the hapless news media in the whole CNN/Buzzfeed flap . At the time , I mildly defended both CNN and Buzzfeed for what they did journalistically , while expressing strong skepticism about the substance of what was in the , which was the original basis for why the subject of Russia potentially having blackmail material on Trump became part of a presidential intelligence briefing . <p> Since then , we have learned a lot more context about this entire story and , after now being able to more confidently put some more pieces of this puzzle together , I have come to two pretty solid conclusions , both of which go against the conventional wisdom among the chattering class . <p> The first is that Buzzfeed was not only ethically justified in publishing the 35-page document , but they were virtually morally obligated to do so . The second is that CNN , while their reporting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great political disservice when they effectively got scared and pushed Buzzfeed under the bus , thus creating the impression that some journalistic crime had been committed here ( a perception which Trump obviously took full advantage ) . <p> Here are some of the developments which helped me reach these determinations . <p> The " 4Chan " hoax theory , latched onto by some of Trump 's media sycophants , including Matt Drudge , turned out , just as I predicted , to be , ironically , " fake news . " While I never believed the silly " 4Chan " theory , having it out there , like a foul smell in the vicinity of a restaurant , clearly had at least a general subconscious impact in making people like me more hesitant to buy into the contents of the dossier even a little bit . <p> We learned the name ( Christopher Steele ) and the very credible background of the author of the " Buzzfeed " memo , not only killed the " 4Chan " theory or the idea that this was some sort of hoax , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , even if not true , has very legitimate reasons to be taken seriously . <p> Intelligence Director James Clapper released a letter about a conversation he had with Trump , while it had the tone of condemnation of the story , actually left no doubt that at least CNN 's reporting was correct . Of course , this did n't stop Trump from lying about what Clapper said , which , in my mind , only heightens the suspicion that there might really be something to all of this ( if there is n't , Trump does n't need to be lying about what Clapper said , unless he just ca n't physically help himself ) . <p> Vice-President Joe Biden confirmed that he and President Obama had both been briefed on the materials in question , further corroborating CNN and thus giving added weight to the substance of the raw intelligence in the dossier . <p> CNN took a network-wide victory lap in the most aggressively fashion you can imagine , showing that this is clearly not a situation where CNN is concerned that they might have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quickly run away . Their extreme confidence in their story tells me that their sources were n't leaking this to them in a hesitant manner , nor were they hyping something that only sounded plausibly significant , but which was really just total bullcrap . Clearly , somebody really important thought that this story was substantial enough to make sure that it was in the public domain . <p> So in this new context , let 's now evaluate Buzzfeed 's role , which has been almost universally admonished by the rest of the news media and castigated by the Trump team ( which actually benefitted politically from what Buzzfeed did ) . Based on what we know now , even if the dossier is completely false , I fail to see much wrong in what Buzzfeed did . <p> Once CNN reported that a document Buzzfeed and many other outlets had was used , directly or indirectly , in a presidential intelligence briefing , in my view that dossier becomes inherently newsworthy , regardless of its veracity . At that point it basically becomes a question of whether the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done by promoting possibly false information . To me , there are several reasons why , especially in this unique set of circumstances , it absolutely does . <p> We obviously are n't dealing with a " normal " President-elect here . Trump has praised Russian leader Vladimir Putin numerous times , told conflicting stories about having met him , and nominated friends of Putin to be both his Secretary of State and National Security Advisor . He has also refused to release his tax returns . And , oh by the way , Russia is believed to have been actively working against his opponent during the campaign . <p> Trump also made the centerpiece of his campaign against Hillary Clinton the idea that her private server issues made her a huge risk to national security . But what could possibly be a greater risk to our national security than Russia possibly having blackmail material on a new president ? <p> Trump also lives in the most fragile of glass houses when it comes to being the victim of supposedly " fake news . " When you falsely claim to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the United States , I think you give up the moral high ground on information in a presidential intelligence briefing leaking out . Heck , does anyone remotely believe that if a similar document backing up " Birtherism " had been unearthed , even under far less credible circumstances , that Trump would n't have released it himself at a live press conference preceded by showgirls and followed by fireworks ? ! <p> But the most important reason why this document absolutely needed to be released is one that I have n't heard anyone even mention . That is , by publishing it you theoretically destroy its value as blackmail because obviously , should Russia really have " Kompromat " on our incoming president , it is rendered virtually powerless if the American public already knows about it . This is why it can be argued that what Buzzfeed did was not only ethically defensible , but it was both obligatory and in the best interests of the nation . <p> However , two things outside of their control ended up destroying much of the inherent value in Buzzfeed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certainly motivated far more by the knowledge that someone else might scoop them at any moment than by any high-brow concern for the public good ) . <p> The first was that Trump vehemently condemned all the allegations in a blanket denial , which effectively ENHANCED the value of any blackmail material Russia might have because now any release would absolutely be politically lethal to him . If he had simply refused to dignify the allegations with direct comment ( LOL ) , then you could make a strong argument that Russia 's leverage against him , assuming it even exists , would be at least be greatly diminished . I realize this put Trump in a bit of a no win situation , but that is why being president is such a tough job . To be clear , I hope/trust that Trump told the truth , but if he did not , then , and I do n't make this charge lightly , he has effectively committed treason and would now be very exposed to impeachment . <p> The second was that , in what I perceived as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were getting , CNN hung Buzzfeed about as far out to dry as they could in a futile effort to separate themselves from the dossier itself after Trump humiliated them at his press conference . In reality , this was perceived as a sign that the premise of the story was highly vulnerable to criticism and created the feeling of blood in the water . <p> Once there is ANY sign of trouble with a major story like this one , especially with the new fear of being labeled with " fake news , " the other major outlets are going to quickly diminish or ignore it , and to a large extent that is what happened here . NBC for instance , in what now seems like a petty political move , even went out of their way to attack the CNN story with what were , at best , nitpicky and irrelevant contradictions . <p> The bottom line of this Buzzfeed controversy is that it really all comes down to two words . I honestly believe that if the highly explosive words " golden shower " were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even half of the criticism it did . <p> They never said that the information was true and they never claimed that it was their reporting . This was document that was deemed important enough to be used at the very highest levels of our government ( if a mistake was made here it was by the intelligence agencies more than Buzzfeed ) . That gave it more than enough significance , especially in the current environment , to be published . The public and the rest of the media should have been mature enough to simply put it all in its proper context . <p> As for how much of the dossier is actually true , I still think/hope that most of it is false . But I must admit that I am not nearly as confident of that view as I was just two days ago . -- John Ziegler hosts a weekly podcast focusing on news media issues and is a documentary filmmaker .

 <h> Head of DC National Guard Ordered to Step Down on Inauguration Day <p> The Washington Postreported earlier today that the commanding general of the D.C. National Guard , Maj. Gen. Errol Schwartz , is being forced to step down from his post and that he has to leave his command on the 20th , during the presidential inauguration ceremonies . <p> Schwartz has been involved in helping plan the inauguration for months , coordinating with the city 's police , Secret Service and other officials . As the inaugural parade is going through Washington , Schwartz will hand over control of the Guard to an interim replacement until a new one is assigned . <p> Schwartz noted haw strange this move was , considering how he would be in charge of thousands of troops gathered in the area for the ceremonial transfer of power . <p> " The timing is extremely unusual , " Schwartz said in an interview Friday morning , confirming a memo announcing his ouster that was obtained by The Washington Post . During the inauguration , Schwartz would command not only the members of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in from across the country to help . He also would oversee military air support protecting the nation 's capital during the inauguration . <p> " My troops will be on the street , " Schwartz , 65 , said . " I 'll see them off but I wo n't be able to welcome them back to the armory . " He said that he would " never plan to leave a mission in the middle of a battle . " <p> The general told the paper he was not instructed why he was being removed , noting he was " a soldier " who was following orders and that the " president has the power to remove me . " <p> Unlike in states , where the duty falls upon governors , the appointment of D.C. 's National Guard commanding officer falls up the President of the United States . 
 <p> While appearing on ABC 's The View today , Vice President Joe Biden was asked about incoming president Donald Trump . He remained diplomatic , but said that he does have major concerns about the President-elect 's foreign policy knowledge , or lack thereof . <p> " What I worry about is the inadvertent mistake in the near term on foreign policy . By that I mean I do n't mean any nuclear war , that kind of malarkey what I think is , there 's a lot of complicated circumstances in Eastern Europe , Ukraine ; there 's a lot of complicated circumstances that exist today in the South China Sea ; there 's a lot of complicated circumstances that exist in Latin America . " <p> He went on to criticize the President-elect for discrediting intelligence agencies , then said that he hopes much of what Trump has said is " rhetorical " and he will learn the value of his words sooner rather than later . 
 <p> New England Patriots fans are celebrating another trip to the AFC Championship game . <p> After a 34-16 win at home over the Houston Texans , the Tom Brady-led squad is advancing to the conference title game yet again for the sixth consecutive year . But that did n't stop a faithful Pittsburgh Steelers fan from crashing a live shot outside of Gillette Stadium Saturday night , interrupting Sports Reporter Joe Amorosino in the process . <p> Just as 7News ' Amorosino was touting the " many weapons " that the Pats have on offense , a Pittsburgh fan jumped in front of the camera to cheer on his squad , who will be playing tomorrow against the Kansas City Chiefs with a shot to play that very New England team next week . His appearance did n't last long . <p> Amorosino posted a version of the clip to his own social media feed with the simple caption , " Yep . " Watch above via 7 News . -- image via screengrab 
 <p> On CNN 's State of the Union today , White House Chief of Staff Denis McDonough reflected on the past 8 years and said the thing he 's " most proud of " is how their administration has been " historically free of scandal . " <p> This talking point echoes the words of President Obama , who said last week , " We are probably the first administration in modern history that has not had a major scandal in the White House . " <p> McDonough also argued that the White House cooperated with every single investigation Congress investigated them for . <p> Jake Tapper pointed out a lot of people ( particularly Republicans overseeing those investigations ) would take issue with that characterization ... 
 <h> ' Was This the Leaker of Fake News ? ' : Trump Takes to Twitter to Attack CIA Director John Brennan <p> Earlier this evening , President-elect Donald his Twitter account to take aim at Saturday Night Live over its blistering cold open , calling the program the " worst of NBC " and " really bad television . " <p> Well , it appears the incoming POTUS was n't done for the day with his Twitter criticism . Responding to CIA Director John News interview today in which the outgoing intel chief stated that Trump does n't seem to understand the Russian threat , Trump sent out these two tweets. 
 <p> The Tweet which appeared from the account read " Also good morning to everyone except Americans who do n't want to accept the simple fact that Hillary Clinton had a major garbage campaign , " in what could be interpreted as a slight pro-Bernie Sanders message . <p> The retweet was promptly removed from the IHOP official social media feed , and in its place the pancake chain put up the following message , writing in part , " we have confirmed that our account was hacked this morning . " <p> After investigation , we have confirmed that our account was hacked this morning . We appreciate our fans bringing this to our attention . <p> The official Twitter account of IHOP has gotten decidedly snarkier in recent years , opting to share photos of its own food alongside hip and trendy lyrics and popular phrases . The company 's account last worked its way into hot water by displaying an image of pancakes with the caption , " Flat but has a GREAT personality " a presumed nod to women 's breasts to the outrage of many . 
 <p> Secretary of State John Kerry offered some criticisms today of President-elect Donald Trump for what he said about Angela Merkel in a new interview . <p> In an interview with the Sunday Times , Trump said of the German chancellor , " I have great respect for her , I felt she was a great leader , I think she made one very catastrophic mistake and that was taking all these illegals and taking all these people where ever they come from and nobody really knows where they come from . " <p> Kerry told CNN 's Christiane Amanpour , " It was inappropriate for a president-elect of the United States to be stepping into the politics of other countries in a quite direct manner . " <p> He suggested that Trump should be more " careful " in talking about another world leader like that and said he does n't agree with his characterization " at all . " 
 <p> Regarding Brexit , the incoming POTUS stated that he " sort of , as you know , predicted it " and said that the United Kingdom voted to leave the European Union because " it wanted its own identity . " This then led to a discussion about Syrian refugees , which he claimed was " the final straw that broke the camel 's back . " Trump added that he believes other countries will leave the EU due to refugees coming in . <p> Trump went on to talk about Merkel and the mistake he feels she made : <p> While he expresses admiration for Angela Merkel , Mr Trump believes that she made " one catastrophic mistake " by welcoming an unlimited number of Syrian refugees . More than one million migrants from north Africa and the Middle East arrived between 2015 and 2016 . He adds that he believes the West should have built safe zones in Syria paid for by the Gulf to limit the surge . " I think she made one very catastrophic mistake and that was taking all of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wherever they come from . And nobody even knows where they come from . " <p> Trump 's use of the term " illegals " to describe refugees did get some reaction online . 
 <h> John Oliver Crashes Game of Thrones , Other HBO Programs to Promote New Season <p> The fourth season for HBO 's Last Week Tonight begins on February 12th . And if the new promo to hype up its return is any indication , the show 's sharp wit will be intact . <p> The clip starts with a shot of the iconic Iron Throne , hyping up the return of HBO 's biggest Sunday night show , with the obvious inference being that it was about Game of Thrones . It 's at that time John Oliver sheepishly emerges from behind the large chair with the realization that the narrator was n't talking about his Sunday program . <p> We get the same situation with Oliver crashing another HBO comedy beginning its fourth season -- Silicon Valley . In this instance , we 're treated to a funny exchange between Oliver and Silicon Valley star Kumail Najiani . <p> One last time , we are presented with Oliver walking while the narrator discussed the " long-awaited return of the HBO show everyone 's waiting for . " This time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to point out that narrator is talking about his program coming back after years off . 
 <p> According to the Dallas News , this would be the first Cabinet to not have at least one Hispanic member since 1988 , when Ronald Reagan chose the first Latino , Laura Cavazos , to be his Secretary of Education . Ever since then , every president has had a Hispanic Cabinet member throughout . <p> Over the past few weeks , it had been reported that the Trump transition team was considering a handful of Hispanics for the position . However , in the end , they decided on Perdue to round out the Trump Cabinet . <p> Hector Sanchez of the National Hispanic Leadership Agenda told the Dallas Newsthat it was " anti-democratic " while hammering Trump . <p> " Trump has not only been the most anti-Latino , anti-immigrant president in the history of the nation . By not including Latinos in the Cabinet he is just showing how he is planning to govern , " Sanchez said , noting that Latinos now account for 17 percent of the U.S. population . <p> In terms of diversity , Trump can point to Ben Carson , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nikki Haley as UN ambassador and Taiwanese-American Elaine Chao , who he 's chosen the head the Department of Transportation . 
 <p> " We have n't asked him , " Tom Barrack , the chair for the committee , told CNN . " He considers himself a friend of the President-elect , but it 's not the venue . The venue we have for entertainment is filled out , it 's perfect , it 's going to be typically and traditionally American , and Kanye is a great guy , but we just have n't asked him to perform . " <p> Barrack said West was n't performing and that the event would be " traditionally American , " but he does n't appear to have ever said West was n't performing because the event was " traditionally American . " As I read it , the comment about it being " traditionally American " seems to be a continuation of his earlier comments that the event being " perfect " and " filled out " : all praiseworthy things for an inauguration ceremony . <p> There were two thoughts in his statement there 'll be no West , and the venue will be great but he never made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say is that Barrack 's point was garbled and confused , but the NYDN tweet just seems extremely uncharitable . <p> A few hours later , Buzzfeed picked up the story with a similar take : " Kanye West Was Not Asked To Perform At ' Typically And Traditionally American ' Inauguration . " That headline 's not as overtly incorrect as NYDN 's , but still ties the two unrelated thoughts together . And the subheadline just omits huge blocks of text to take it even further out of context : " He considers himself a friend of the president-elect , but it 's not the venue ... It 's going to be typically and traditionally American . " <p> Unsurprisingly , people tweeting out the Buzzfeed piece ended up with the same mistaken impression they did from the NYDN piece , often never getting further than the headline and sub-headline . <p> What 's bizarre is that the Buzzfeed piece was already corrected : " An earlier version of this post included the suggestion that Kanye West was not invited to perform at the inauguration due to it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Barrack did not say that . " Kudos for admitting they were wrong , but I do n't understand why the piece is still written in a way that gives that mistaken impression . <p> As a final note , I 'll point out that there actually is an African-American performer for the inauguration : Chrisette Michele . Likewise , Broadway star Jennifer Holliday was scheduled to perform , but backed out after being pressured by -- well , many of the same people now accusing Trump of excluding blacks . So really , this whole story ought to have been dismissed from the outset . <p> UPDATE ( 3:14 PM ET ) : Geez , now even The New York Post is getting in on the game . 
 <p> Protesters have gathered in Washington D.C. tonight outside the National Press Club where Donald Trump supporters have gathered for an event called " Deploraball . " <p> The event page for the Deploraball read in part , " There will be many inaugural balls , but there will be nothing like our party our massive , 1,000-person extravaganza to celebrate the Inauguration of President-Elect Trump . Attendees include Trump supporters of all backgrounds , ethnicities , and walks of life , from all over the country and world . This is a ' big tent ' event for Trump supporters . " <p> And with a Trump-supporting event taking place in D.C. tonight , there were , of course , protesters gathered outside : 
 <p> During the Congressional Luncheon after his inauguration , President Trump had the room stand up in order to honor his 2016 Democratic rival : Hillary Clinton . <p> The former Secretary of State attended the ceremony earlier today , and she shook hands with Trump as they took their seats inside the building . As the meal concluded , Trump stepped up and offered some remarks . <p> " I was very honored when I heard President Bill Clinton and Secretary Hillary Clinton was coming today , " Trump said . As applause broke out , Trump asked everyone in the room to rise and join in . <p> Trump joined the applause himself , and as it died down , he said , " There 's nothing more I can say , because I have a lot of respect for those two people . " <p> Mrs. Clinton stood up for the ovation , and she appeared to mouth " thank you " for the gesture . 
 <h> Donald and Melania Trump 's First Dance as First Couple of America <p> During the one of the three inaugural balls they were scheduled to attend this evening , the 45th President of the United States , Donald Trump , danced with the nation 's new First Lady , Melania Trump . <p> In one of the grand traditions of the presidential inauguration , the Trumps had their first dance as America 's First Couple . However , before taking the dance floor , the new POTUS addressed the crowd , telling the audience that he " respects " that people that did n't like him very much told him he had done a really good job with the inauguration . <p> He also remarked about how they did something " very special " while praising his running mate , Vice-President Mike Pence . That was followed by a " Make America Great Again ! " <p> The couple proceeded to cut a rug to the strains of ' My Way , ' a song made famous by Frank Sinatra and apparently one of Trump 's very favorites . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Trump 's grown children and spouses . The song was sung by Erin Boheme , Nickie Conley and Jason Eskridge. 
 <p> The morning after Donald Trump was inaugurated as the 45th President of the United States , he took to Twitter his personal account , not his official @POTUS one to thank the media , and particularly Fox News , for all of the GREAT reviews of his inauguration speech . <p> A fantastic day and evening in Washington you to @FoxNews and so many other news outlets for the GREAT reviews of the speech ! <p> Now , one can claim that Fox News was largely complimentary of the speech , if not exactly extremely praiseworthy . Following Trump 's first address to the nation as its president , Fox 's Tucker the speech " populism " and that it was " not a conservative speech . " He also lauded it showing a " freshness about the way Trump sees the country . " <p> While other commentators at Fox described it as " muscular , " " very forceful " and " masterful " while stating it was " completely nonpartisan , " only one seemed to be overly hyperbolic with her critique @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Fox News provided GREAT reviews of his speech , even if it would seem they were more on the decent to good scale . But who are these " so many other news outlets " that heaped praise upon President Trump 's address ? <p> Over on CNN , Jake it " One of the most radical inaugural speeches we 've ever heard . " The network also collected a number of takeaways from across the political spectrum , with a common theme being that it showed Trump will not change , that it showed flashes of authoritarianism and that it reflected Trump 's appeal to populism . Only conservative commentator Alice Stewart gave a full-throated commendation of the speech . <p> Looking at newspapers , major news sites and magazines , the consensus was that the speech was dark and angry . The Los Angeles Times review had this to say about the address : " The 16-minute inaugural address that President Trump delivered was Trumpism distilled to its raw essence : angry , blunt-spoken and deeply aggrieved . " <p> The New York Timeshighlighted how " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ build bridges to his opponents . " Conservative pundit George extremely blunt in his appraisal , labeling it " the most dreadful inaugural address in history . " TIME it a " grim assessment of the state of the nation . " <p> So , once again , one has to ask who are all of these many media outlets that praised his speech ? 
 <p> Earlier this week , it was reported that President Donald Trump wrote his inauguration speech himself , with CNN stating that two Trump transition officials told them he had written the draft . The report further noted that the president told historian Douglas Brinkley last month that he was writing the address . <p> Trump would also post an image on social media of him purportedly working on the speech while at Mar-a-Lago weeks ago . <p> Much of the speech was written by Stephen Miller and Steve Bannon , two of Mr. Trump 's top advisers , a White House official said . <p> " I do n't think we 've had a speech like that since Andrew Jackson came to the White House , " said Mr. Bannon , Mr. Trump 's chief strategist and senior counselor . " It 's got a deep , deep root of patriotism . " <p> During the campaign and after winning the election in November , Miller had been largely responsible for many of Trump 's prepared speeches . In fact , it had also been reported last month by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the inaugural address . 
 <h> SNL Sings ' To Sir With Love ' In Honor of President Obama <p> Standing in front of a banner of America 's former leader , Strong sang " To Sir , With Love " before Zamata joined in halfway . <p> At the end of the song , the two of them presented Obama with a present : a tea mug saying " world 's greatest president . " The two offered their last goodbyes , though Zamata could n't help but slip in a " do n't go " amid the 
 <p> The opening panel for MSNBC 's Morning Joe took on the weekend of controversies for the fresh-faced Trump administration , beginning with Sean Spicer 's combative press conference and the President 's allegedly tone-deaf message at the CIA . <p> " This was a tale of two weekends , " said Joe Scarborough , indicating that the pro-Trump good feelings in our nation 's capital quickly gave way to hundreds of thousands of protestors who took to the streets as part of the Women 's March on Washington . " You look at the first full day in the White House for this President : it could not have gone worse . " <p> Mark Halperin of Bloomberg notably added , " As for this White House 's performance : governments lie all the time , " he said . " Usually they lie about big things . This was a series of lies from the President , from his spokesman , that were unnecessary , " he said of the combative tone surrounding inauguration crowd size . <p> " But I think most disturbing was what the President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To stand in front of the wall of people who have made the ultimate sacrifice for this country with no credit because they 're anonymous and to talk about himself that way I think that confirms the worst feelings people had . People say there 's a good Trump and a bad Trump . It 's the absolute worst of Donald Trump 's personality . " <p> " It could not have gone worse ; it could not have been more concerning , " Scarborough added at one point , as the conversation shifted onto the fact that the White House staff is comprised of people who have never served in a White House administration before . " They better get somebody in there who has been to this rodeo before . " 
 <p> Newsweek apologized Tuesday after publishing a piece that relished in the assault on white supremacist Richard Spencer Friday as he was counter-protesting at an anti-Donald Trump demonstration in Washington , D.C. <p> " The Infinite Joy of Watching a Nazi Get Punched to Music , " Newsweek culture editor Joe wrote . " On a day when many Americans were despairing over what they see as the transition of power to a fascist demagogue , it was a small moment of reprieve . It was possibly the first entertaining day on the internet since the election . " <p> " Like any resilient meme , the remixes started to appear . In this case , the game was simple : sync the punch up with a memorable moment ( often percussive ) from a hit song . It was ... beautiful ... " he continued . " Watching a smug Nazi get blasted by brave fists of justice has always been and will always be entertaining . " <p> After being up for around two hours , the article disappeared . Newsweek then apologized on Twitter . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the assault of Richard Spencer , published on Jan. 24. 
 <p> We 've been highly critical of the idea of Floyd Mayweather and Conor McGregor squaring off in a boxing match . But we will concede that we rather enjoyed watching this video game simulation at least up until the odd , violent conclusion . <p> The video was fashioned after the classic Nintendo boxing game Mike Tyson 's Punch Out ! ! . The graphics are perfect . So is the music , and the sound effects as a whole . <p> The first two rounds are amusing . It proceeds much as we suspect a real boxing match between the two would with Mayweather giving a boxing lesson to the mixed martial arts star . McGregor is frustrated that he ca n't get inside . Between rounds , a thought bubble pops up which shows McGregor saying " This bum do n't do nuthing ( sic ) but hug . " The whole thing is fun to watch . <p> But then comes the third round , and that brutal ending . We 'll spare you the details -- but the gist is that McGregor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , begins to employ mixed martial arts tactics . It does n't go well for Mayweather. 
 <p> This begs the question : what did Todd do before he NBC brought him aboard in 2007 ? The answer is that Todd worked as editor-in-chief for National Journal 's The Hotline , where he also did webcasts on the political developments of the day . <p> In this clip from 2006 , Todd and co-host John Mercurio talked about what sort of blowback the Congressional GOP could face over the Mark Foley sex scandal . The Florida Republican Representative was accused of making repeated sexual advances towards underage congressional pages , and it ultimately forced him to resign from his position . <p> In the midst of the scandal , it came to light that colleagues of Foley 's like House Majority Leader John Boehner and J. Dennis Hastert might have known about what was going . Since neither congressman called for an investigation on Foley , Todd and Mercurio discussed the impact this would have on their political futures . <p> Todd and Mercurio were especially interested in what would happen to Hastert since the scandal broke during his tenure as Speaker of the House . 
 <p> This decision was communicated by the agency 's leadership on Wednesday . This would indicate that while he has yet to do it , President Donald Trump will be signing an executive order temporarily stopping America 's refugee program . <p> It was reported earlier this week that in a draft executive order , the Trump Administration would suspend all refugees from entering the country for 120 days and place an indefinite ban on refugees from war-torn Syria . <p> The order would also greatly reduce the number of refugees the US would take in once the suspension is lifted , taking that number from 110,000 down to 50,000 . On top of that , immigration from several Middle Eastern and African countries would be suspended for at least 30 days while new screening procedures are put in place . <p> White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer stated that Trump is scheduled to sign a number of executive orders on Friday . He would not state if any of those would be involving the refugee program and immigration . 
 <h> High School Teacher Suspended For Staging Mock Assassination of President Trump <p> The Dallas Independent School District has put a teacher on administrative leave over a social media video where she depicts herself taking the life of President Donald Trump . <p> Payal Modi is an art teacher at W.H. Adamson High School , and she received a great deal of attention from news sites ever since she put up a video on Instagram for Inauguration Day . The video shows Trump being projected on a whiteboard while Modi shoots him with a water gun and yelling " die ! " <p> " Watching the #inauguration in my classroom like .... #no #stop #denial #squirtgun #hypocrisy #powerless , " Modi reportedly wrote on the video caption . Her account has been set to private and the video was deleted , though copies of it have circulated around the Internet . <p> " Today , we were made aware of a social media posting being circulated involving a teacher at W. H. Adamson High School , " the school board said in a statement . " The teacher has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ investigation . This is a personnel matter and as such we can not comment . " 
 <p> The new White House staff ran into a bit of a problem on Friday when admitting press for the news conference held by President Donald Trump and UK Prime Minister Teresa May . According Jim Waterson of BuzzFeed News UK , the dates of birth for British reporters were submitted in the date format used internationally , and it caused ... issues . <p> British press corp is locked outside the White House because our birthdates were submitted in UK format and secret service do n't get it . ? ? ? ? <p> The UK , along with the the rest of Europe and almost the entire world , formats dates as day/month/year . Today , for example , would be 27/1/2017 or 27th January , 2017 as opposed to 1/27/2017 or January 27th , 2017 . This led to confusion and meant that the dates were " wrong " for a number of reporters , and according to Waterson , only those where the issue was obvious ( because they were born after the 12th day of the month ) got in : 
 <h> Three Members of the Original Broadway Cast of Hamilton Will Perform at the Super Bowl <p> This year , the Super Bowl is getting a taste of Broadway . Today , it was announced that the original Schuyler Sisters , Renee Elise Goldsberry , Philippa Soo , and Jasmine Cephas Jones , who were all in the original cast of Hamilton will be performing " America The Beautiful " before the game . Expect Destiny 's Child-level harmonies , and , for fans of the show , for it to be the most exciting moment of the evening . <p> Other performers include Luke Bryan , who will be singing the national anthem and Lady Gaga has been preparing for what looks like it 's going to be a pretty epic halftime show . <p> Goldsberry , who played Angelica Schuyler in the original cast posted a photo to her Instagram to celebrate the announcement 
 <p> Following Trump 's action , a number of Democrats released statements condemning the order , which suspends refugee admissions for 120 days , indefinitely bans certain Syrian refugees and suspends visas from a number of Muslim countries . <p> Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer ( D-NY ) released the following statement : <p> Chuck Schumer of Trump 's ' extreme vetting ' Exec . Order : " Tears are running down the cheeks of the Statue of Liberty tonight . " **26;1165;TOOLONG <p> " Today 's executive order by President Trump using extreme vetting and banning refugees from many majority Muslim countries is offensive and a monumental waste of federal resources . Having served on active duty , we are taught that to defeat the enemy , we first need to know our enemy . Our enemies are terrorist groups such as ISIS and AL Qaeda , not children , women and senior citizens fleeing those groups . " <p> " The chances of being struck by lightning TWICE is 1 in 9 million . The chances of being killed by a refugee committing a terrorist act is 1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Trump 's action is not based on national security , it is based on bigotry . Lady Liberty is crying .

 <p> The halt by Ann Donnelly of the United States District Court in New York 's Eastern District is temporary and is only granted to those who have already arrived ; the future however for POTUS ' executive action and how it will be applied to citizens coming from those countries is unclear . <p> Despite the celebrations by the ACLU over the swift reversal , the Trump administration will still have the opportunity to sign further executive action as the next steps in the saga . MSNBC 's Chief Legal Correspondent Ari Melber cautioned that the stay is simply a temporary development , saying , " ... the first blowback to his cascade of executive action , " but noted that , " it will have some constraint on what President Trump is trying to do . " <p> CNN 's Jim Sciutto further points out that the stay is exactly that a stay for those who are already here , indicating there will be a , " Massive court fight to come . " 
 <p> President Trump this morning slammed the New York Times and defended his " extreme vetting " plans a day after massive uproar over his immigration executive order . <p> People were protesting at JFK and other airports yesterday in response to people being detained after Trump 's order to ban entry to the U.S. by refugees and people from seven predominantly-Muslim nations . A federal judge granted a stay on the order . <p> That , of course , is the big headline on the front page of today 's Times . And earlier this morning , Trump slammed the paper on Twitter : <p> Somebody with aptitude and conviction should buy the FAKE NEWS and failing @nytimes and either run it correctly or let it fold with dignity ! 
 <p> At tonight 's Screen Actors Guild awards , Julia Louis-Dreyfus received the award in the Female Actor in a Comedy Series category . <p> Like Meryl Streep did at the Golden Globes , the Veep actress used her speech to go after Donald Trump . From the possibility that Russia hacked the election to a quick joke about the size of the crowd in front of her , she kept it funny at first , but quickly moved to more serious topics . <p> " I want you all to know that I am the daughter of an immigrant , " she said . " My father fled religious persecution in Nazi-occupied France and I 'm an American patriot and I love this country . Because I love this country , I am horrified by its blemishes and this immigrant ban is a blemish and it is un-American . " <p> She went on to read a statement from the SAG 's sister union , the Writers Guild of America . Today , they , too , blasted Trump for his recent travel ban on immigrants from seven predominantly Muslim countries . 
 <p> On Monday morning , President Trump defended this weekend 's " extreme vetting " executive order while dismissing the outrage and the immigration connotations sparked in the fallout . <p> The order banned U.S. entry to individuals from seven predominantly-Muslim nations , and it prompted anti-Trump , pro-Muslim refugee protests around the country . Many of these demonstrations took place at airports , and there were concerns about whether Green Card holders would be cleared for entrance , or otherwise be detained like multiple travelers were . <p> Trump responded to the commotion by downplaying the complications his order caused and saying it was worth the price for national security . He also had some ideas about who was to blame for problems at the airport over the caused by Delta computer outage , ..... <p> Trump 's dig at Chuck Schumer refers to a Sunday press conference where the New York senator teared up while denouncing the president 's " mean-spirited and un-American " executive order . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that caused Delta Airlines to ground all of their domestic flights . <p> UPDATE 9:59 a.m . EST : During a meeting with small business owners , Trump took aim at Schumer again by saying his tears were fake and Trump wants to know " who is his acting coach ? " <p> At small business mtg , Trump says Chuck Schumer cried " fake tears . " A " 5% chance " tears were real , wants to ask who his acting coach is. 
 <p> Over the weekend , actor Kal Penn posted a photo to Twitter that showed the hateful comment of an online troll who said " You do n't belong in this country , you f*cking joke . " Instead of getting angry over it , he decided to start a fundraising page in that person 's name to raise money to give to Syrian refugees . <p> The description on the Crowdrise page says " We are better than the hateful people who tell us we do n't belong in our own country , that America ca n't be a beacon of freedom and hope for refugees from around the world . We will turn their bigotry , along with the President 's , into love . " <p> The goal , at first was to raise $2,500 . After 11 minutes , however , Penn tweeted that he had already raised half that , and raised the goal . 
 <h> United Nations Pegs Count of Refugees Affected by Ban at 20,000 <p> On Monday , United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees , the U.N . ' s refugee agency , issued a statement on the consequences of President Donald Trump 's executive order temporarily banning immigration from seven Muslim-majority countries . After saying that commissioner Filippo Grandi is " deeply worried " by what 's going on , the statement laid out the number of people that the U.N . estimates are affected by the executive order . Their tally has 800 refugees set to enter the U.S. this week locked out , with 20,000 affected over the course of the 120 day ban . The larger number is " based on average monthly figures for the last 15 years . " <p> " Refugees share the very same concerns about security and safety that Americans have , " the statement says . " They themselves are fleeing war , persecution , oppression and terrorism . The individuals and families UNHCR refers to governments for resettlement are the most vulnerable such as people needing urgent medical assistance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The new homes provided by resettlement countries are life-saving for people who have no other options . " 
 <h> Sean Spicer : Refugee Ban Issues Are ' Being Blown Out of Proportion ' <p> On Monday , during his first press briefing since the protests over and court rulings against President Donald Trump 's executive order restricting immigration , White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer stuck to repeating the talking point that the number of travelers delayed was minimal . " It 's relatively minor as a percentage of the overall total , " he said . " So when you look at how this worked on a Saturday , 109 people out of 325,000 were slowed down going in . I truly believe it 's being blown out of proportion , the extent to which this actually was ... for what it did ... and I think government functioned very well . " <p> Spicer stressed that all of the 109 got into the United States after the screening , so " the system actually worked really well . " Adding that " that 's the takeaway from this , " he reiterated that " the system worked well and the country is safer for it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be short term , because in the future , there wo n't be complications from people being en route to the United States as the executive order was issued . He did not address any complaints of the greater context of the order beyond this past weekend 's travel delays . <p> Meanwhile , on Twitter , it was pointed out that Spicer has not had much patience for being inconvenienced by air travel in the past : <p> muslim ban is being " blown out of proportion , " says same guy who regularly tweets at airlines to whine about minor inconveniences **26;1703;TOOLONG 
 <h> ' Those Are Alternative Facts ' : Tapper Rips White House for Portrayal of National Security Council <p> Earlier today at the White House press briefing , White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer with the help of props said that any suggestions the White House made a major shakeup of the National Security Council were " utter nonsense . " This was in the wake of reports that chief strategist and former Breitbart publisher Steve Bannon was given a seat at the council . <p> Well , CNN 's Jake Tapper did n't take too kindly to that description . While hosting The Lead , Tapper used a term the Trump Administration recently coined to hit back at them . <p> " To be charitable , those are alternative facts from our friends at the White House , " the anchor stated . " National security experts in the presidential memorandum making the change disagree . " <p> Tapper went on to note that neither of the last two presidents top strategists were given seats on the council , pointing out that Karl Rove was n't even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attend as an observer . <p> He further added that the Director of National Intelligence and the Chariman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff are no longer principal members but will be asked to attend when their expertise is needed on pertinent issues , explaining that also represents a major change . <p> " Why the president would think that the former publisher of Breitbart is a more important voice on national security matters than the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff or the Director of National Intelligence , that 's a mystery , " Tapper opined. 
 <p> Sean Hannity , one of the people in the media most enthusiastic about Donald Trump 's presidency , spoke to Politico about what he believes the mainstream media does n't understand about Trump and his appeal . <p> Hannity has been criticizing the press for liberal bias going back years , and more recently he 's taken to referring to it as the " alt-left radical mainstream media . " He 's also publicly questioned whether the Trump White House should be reevaluating its relationship with the press and whether the WikiLeaks revelations will get them thinking about keeping out certain outlets . <p> Hannity told Politico that when media outlets are outright calling the president a liar , it 's a serious blow to their credibility . <p> And he thinks a lot of it has to do with elitism : <p> They do n't understand Donald Trump , they do n't understand the phenomenon , they do n't understand what happened in this election , the level of elitism is breathtaking to me ... <p> The media has a bunch of overpaid , out of touch , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that do make this country great . I am not one of those people . <p> A few months ago Hannity said on his show , " Now , my overpaid friends in the media , well , they have their chauffeured limousines , they like their fine steakhouses and expensive wine lifestyles . " ( People subsequently pointed out that Hannity himself does pretty well with his highly-rated primetime program on a dominant cable network . ) <p> He also reacted to the big debate over inauguration crowd sizes by saying , " Who gives a shit ? That does n't help the average person . " 
 <p> Bill O'Reilly thinks that President Trump is doing the right thing by wanting to crack down on immigration but in what will come as a surprise to some , highlighted that security needs should be balanced out with American compassion towards the suffering . <p> He pushed back against liberal outrage over the ban and said that the Obama administration 's actions led to the " massive flow of refugees " the world is seeing now . But while O'Reilly acknowledged it 's " responsible and logical " to get tougher on immigration , he also argued that people with the proper credentials should not be punished , especially if they are people who have assisted the United States abroad ( i.e. as military interpreters ) . <p> " It would be wise for the Trump administration , " he said , " to develop a strong outreach to the Muslim world . We need their support to defeat the jihad . " <p> O'Reilly concluded thusly : <p> " We do n't want to tarnish the message the Statue of Liberty sends . Also , the administration must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should help refugees survive in the terror zones abroad ... Protecting Americans is obviously priority number one , but the nobility of our nation demands we help suffering , helpless people if we can . " 
 <p> According to a poll by Reuters/Ipsos , 49% of Americans wither strongly or somewhat agree with the order , which stops refugees from entering the country for 120 days , indefinitely bans Syrian refugees and temporarily suspends travel from seven Muslim-majority countries . 41% of the public strongly or somewhat disagree with the ban and 10% say they do n't know . <p> The responses fell along partisan lines . 51% of Republicans said they strongly agree with Trump 's action while 53% of Democrats told pollsters they strongly disagreed . <p> Regarding whether the United States was setting a setting a good example on how to confront terrorism , 38% of respondents felt America was . On the other hand , 41% of the public stated the country was setting a bad example . 31% said they felt more safe due to the order and 26% explained that it made them feel less safe . <p> Those polled were also asked if America should show a preference to Christian refugees with 56% disagreeing with that the country should take Christians in while turning away Muslim refugees . The president has suggested that he may do that . 
 <p> A woman who was allegedly a victim of domestic violence at the hands of an NFL player is speaking out and blasting the NFL for a response to the incident that she felt was an effort to try to sweep it under the carpet . <p> In a detailed story on domestic violence and the NFL by Bleacher Report contributor Mary Pilon , Kendra Scott accused her then-fiancee , former San Francisco 49ers defensive lineman Ray McDonald , of hitting her on several occasions in the summer of 2014 . In the story , which includes pictures of bruises on Scott 's face , Scott claimed that McDonald once dragged her out of bed in the middle of the night , and kneed her in the stomach while she was pregnant . ( Scott Rosenblum , an attorney representing McDonald , " categorically denied " Scott 's allegations .

The letter included a phone number , which Scott called . She claims the person who answered did n't know anything about her case . <p> " It almost felt like a joke , " Scott said . " A letter ? Really ? This is how you guys handle this ? " <p> According to Scott , it was all part of the league 's efforts to keep alleged domestic violence incidents quiet . <p> " They do n't want the negative publicity , " Scott said . " They do n't want the attention . They do n't want to be associated with that . But it is such a real issue . It happens all the time . " <p> McDonald was not suspended by the 49ers . He was released on Dec. 17 , 2014 , the same day he was accused of raping a different woman . Three months later , McDonald was signed by the Chicago Bears . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a protective order against Scott . The Bears promptly released him . <p> To date , McDonald has yet to be convicted of any crime , although the protection order violation charge is still pending . McDonald is currently out of the league , but he was never suspended . <p> Scott believes it 's part of a larger pattern to keep such cases quiet . <p> " It 's such a hush-hush thing in the NFL , " Scott said . " There 's always an excuse . " 
 <p> Of course , I 'm referencing " alternative facts , " the phrase that the senior presidential advisor slipped in to a recent Meet The Press interview with Chuck Todd . The reaction was swift and widespread ; a social media hashtag encouraged people to contribute their own alternative facts , while cable news and late night hosts alike managed their own shots at the former campaign manager . <p> And now , the phrase as worked its way into the public consciousness of advertising thanks to the minds at Ogilvy . <p> Dove antiperspirant has rolled out a new series of print ads featuring the #alternativefacts hashtag in an effort to promote its product . Of course , it should be noted that Dove has chosen UK markets for its new ad rollout distribution ; the two-page spread appeared in The Guardian and The Times of London , lest they drum up the ire of the POTUS ' Twitter account ( I 'm sure the publicly-trading Unilever would n't be all too thrilled to see nervous investors react to such presidential criticisms ) . <p> Some of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increases your IQ by 40 points . <p> New Dove antiperspirant boosts your Wi-Fi signal . <p> New Dove antiperspirant rhymes with orange . <p> New Dove antiperspirant knows a guy who can get you on the guest list . <p> New Dove antiperspirant will locate that lost sock from two years ago . <p> New Dove antiperspirant makes the elevator arrive when you feverishly press the button . <p> Notably the ad does not reference the President of the United States or Kellyanne Conway directly , but the implications are clear . Tham Khai Meng , Dove 's global co-chairman , said in an email , " Brands live in a world of accountability . And that 's a good thing . To see one respond so swiftly with an #AlternativeFact moment , done gently and with a smile , reminds us of that . " 
 <p> President Trump is making an unexpected trip to Dover Air Force Base today in order to witness the return of a Navy SEAL who died in a counter-terrorism operation on Sunday . <p> Chief Special Warfare Operator William " Ryan " Owens was part of a team leading a raid on an al Qaeda base in Yemen . The raid unexpectedly became a firefight , and though three senior al Qaeda leaders were killed , Owens died from the wounds he suffered during the skirmish . <p> Trump has been in contact with Owen 's family , and he will be making a closed-press appearance when Owen 's body arrives at the Delaware military base . Trump is flying there on Marine One , and he is joined by his daughter Ivanka , and Senator Chris Coons ( D-DE ) . <p> The death of Owens marks the first time a member of the military has died under Trump 's command . 
 <p> According to an excerpt obtained by the Associated Press , President Donald Trump threatened to send the United States military to the border if Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto did n't do more to stop his country 's " bad hombres . " <p> The call last week was seen as an attempt to smooth things over between the two leaders following a canceled meeting . The scheduled meeting was nixed in the wake of a public back-and-forth between the two presidents over Trump 's proposed border wall and who would eventually pay for it . <p> If the excerpt of the call is to be believed , it would appear the call did n't do much to improve the increasingly strained relationship between the two countries . <p> " You have a bunch of bad hombres down there , " Trump told of it . " <p> The Mexican foreign relations department hit back against the report , denying that the call was contentious and that the " tone was constructive . " 
 <h> In FL , Throwaway Votes For the Likes of Beyonc ? and Mickey Mouse Outnumbered Trump 's Victory Margin <p> In what looks like a protest against the presidential candidates from major parties in the 2016 election , Floridians voted for illegitimate options in record numbers last November . <p> They voted for Beyonc ? , Mickey Mouse , Tim Tebow , and more , but not Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton . <p> In fact , according to the Tampa Bay Times , a report released by state officials yesterday showed that out of everyone who voted in person or by mail-in ballot , over 161,000 did n't vote for a legitimate presidential candidate . Most importantly , the Times pointed out this : <p> If around 48,000 of those people had voted for Clinton instead of the mythical god Thor or Clinton 's Democratic primary rival Bernie Sanders , she would have received 29 electoral votes and we probably would n't be writing and reading about Trump Schwarzenegger at the National Prayer Breakfast this morning . 
 <p> Yes , there is Star Wars ' own Jar Jar Binks , peering out from a cloud of smoke and almost blending right in to the scene of missile fire behind him . <p> Before you go thinking that Matt Drudge is going blind or got trolled hard by a stock photography site , let 's talk about the history of this particular image . <p> Back in 2012 , The that the altered image of Binks appeared on the website of Iran 's " semi-official Mehr News Agency ( MNA ) . " They said this : <p> On the homepage of its website today , the image appears next to a story downplaying the threat of Iran 's ballistic missile program . It 's a small image but upon closer inspection , you can see that something is amiss . <p> It seems to stem from an old Internet prank ; MNA appears to have been duped by it . In 2008 , Iran was caught photoshopping an extra missile into a photo of a launch , which led Photoshop-savvy jokesters to rag on them mercilessly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was apparently among the slew of gag pictures uploaded to forums at the time , which seemingly led to it being used later by MNA . <p> We do n't know whether Drudge used the Binks image intentionally , though we have reached out to him for comment . It appears that the Binks image tricked editors in Iran when they used it on the MNA site , but even that is dubious . As The Atlantic points out , it was originally used on May 4 , which is also known as Star Wars Day . <p> The only issue , of course , is that today is n't Star Wars Day . We will update this post if we learn more about the intentions behind the photo . 
 <p> In response to the temporary block on his travel ban , Trump has been blasting Seattle District Judge James Robart while referring to him as a " so-called judge . " George Stephanopoulos spoke to Pence about this , asking " is it appropriate " for Trump to question the legitimacy of a federal judge . <p> Pence defended the legality and the purpose of the executive order , but Stephanopoulos went in further by asking if Trump 's comments " undermine the separation of powers in the Constitution ? " <p> " I do n't think it does , " said Pence . " I think the American people are very accustomed to this president speaking his mind and speaking very straight with them . " <p> Stephanopoulos also asked Pence about what makes Robart a " so-called judge , " and whether the judge has the judicial authority to halt Trump 's order . <p> You can watch how Pence responded in the video above , via ABC . The complete interview will air on Sunday . 
 <p> United States immigration was front and center in a sketch on Saturday Night Live tonight , as Cecily Strong played a US Customs agent hosting an orientation video for people settling in the country for the first time . <p> That is , with a few updates inspired by the Presidency of Donald Trump . <p> " Let 's go over a few documents you 'll need , " she says . " First , your US customs form . You 'll also need a valid passport from your country of origin . " 
 <p> McConnell did n't directly answer the question as it relates to the president , instead stating that he does n't " think there is any equivalency with the way the Russians conduct themselves and the way the United States does . " <p> Tapper reframed the question , asking how McConnell would have reacted if President Obama " defended the murderous reign of Putin by saying ' You think our country is so innocent . ' " <p> Again , McConnell obfuscated , stating that he believes " America is exceptional " and that we " do n't operate the way Russia does . " <p> Finally , Tapper wondered aloud if President Trump understands this and stating that if Obama would have said the same thing Trump did , there would be " protests in the street . " <p> " Look , Jake , I can speak to myself and I already have about my feelings for Vladimir Putin , " McConnell responded . " I 'm not going to critique every utterance of the president . " 
 <h> You Can be ' Quite a Ridiculous Figure ' : Michael Wolff Rips Stelter for Lecturing on ' Virtues of the Media ' <p> During an at times contentious exchange today on CNN 's Reliable Sources , The Hollywood Reporter columnist Michael Wolff criticized host Brian Stelter over the style and approach Stelter has taken of late on his program . <p> Wolff came on to essentially make the case that the media as a whole has been overreacting to the presidency of Donald Trump and what it means to journalism as a whole . After Stelter explained that the editor of the New Yorker told him that this is " an emergency " and that " journalists have to act differently , " Wolff dismissed it as the editor just being " personally offended and upset . " <p> While Wolff did admit that he is " sucking up a bit " in order to get access to the White House , he said he did n't necessarily know if he was going easy on the White House to gain that access . He further noted that this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then turned into a conversation about whether the media was at war with Trump . <p> The discussion eventually switched to Wolff 's take on the CNN senior media correspondent 's coverage of the media under Trump . The writer 's criticism of Stelter in a recent Newsweek piece was also brought up . When asked by Stelter what he he thought was wrong with his style or substance , Wolff gave the following response : <p> I mean this with truly no disrespect , but I think you can border on being sort of quite a ridiculous figure . It 's not a good look to repeatedly and self-righteously defend your own self-interest . The media should not be the story . Every week in this religious sense you make it the story . We are not the story . <p> When Stelter hit back , asking why there was n't room for one hour a week on CNN for this , Wolff responded by saying he loved the show but he wished Stelter " would n't turn to the camera and lecture America about the virtues of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Wolff would go on and say the front page of the New York Times now looks like 1938 Germany every single day , with Stelter pushing back against that characterization . 
 <p> CNN 's Jake Tapper is a good news anchor and a good artist . On Sundays , during his State of the Union , he combines those two skills in one segment called " State of the . " Today being Super Bowl Sunday , he combined two more things : football and politics . <p> Watch above to see him talk about " political football ' and the unique way that Tom a role in Donald Trump 's presidency just as much as he 'll be playing a role in today 's big game . Keep watching to find out what Vladimir Putin has to do with all of it ... 
 <p> During his first Fox News Super Bowl sit-down as President , Donald Trump gave a strange defense of Vladimir Putin in an interview with Bill O'Reilly that left Morning Joe cohosts Mika Brzezinski and Joe Scarborough utterly perplexed . <p> O'Reilly pressed the President on why he has championed such support for Putin , clarifying in his questions , " He 's a killer though , Putin 's a killer . " <p> After playing the clip on Monday 's Morning Joe , Brzezinski said , " I mean at this point , you 're asking ' why ' ? You have to ask why to this , " before rolling a 2015 MSNBC interview where then-candidate Trump argued much of the same . <p> Her cohost Scarborough questioned the " moral equivalency , " of Trump to defend Putin 's notorious killing of Russian journalists , a fact that lawmakers on both sides of the political idealogical divide have called out for years . " You just have to wonder how any President could say that about our country that I will say again -- it begs repeating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on this planet than any other country in human history , " Scarborough said Monday morning . <p> " This desire to keep preaching moral equivalency is baffling continues it was disturbing enough a year ago it is baffling now as President of the United States that he 's still doing this , " Scarborough continued after recounting many of the well-documented acts of aggression and hostility towards Russian journalists and opponents by the Kremlin . <p> Among the victims of the so-called Putin body count is Boris Nemtsov , a political opponent of Vladimir Putin 's who in 2015 was shot dead on a bridge just several yards from the Kremlin the night he was supposed to lead a large march against Russia 's aggression in the Ukraine . President Barack Obama at the time spoke out against the killing , calling it a , " brutal murder . " 
 <h> Morning Joe Rebukes Trump 's Lack of Females in White House and ' All These Old White Guys ' <p> Mike Brzezinski of MSNBC 's Morning Joe led the charge Monday morning against the administration of Donald Trump for the optics surrounding his Cabinet 's notable absence of women leaders . <p> It 's a sentiment that she shared with two fellow females during the segment , Tina Brown , the founder of Women of the World , and Elise Jordan , the former Rand Paul staffer who regularly appears on the morning talk show . <p> " The feeling that we 're getting from this administration backed up actually by what they 're doing I guess it just makes even more of a calling for organizations , " Brzezinski said Monday morning . Based on the numbers of protestors who have gathered in recent weeks in direct opposition to President Trump 's administration , most notably the Women 's March on Washington , she continued , " There are people in this country feeling completely left out and threatened by what they 're saying . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the photographs of Trump 's cabinet , I mean it looks sort of like 1975 : all these old white guys . It really is , except for a handful of women . " <p> The Cabinet currently includes only two women who have been confirmed by the Senate Elaine Chao for Transportation and Nikki Haley as Ambassador to the United Nations while the controversial Betsy DeVos has not yet been confirmed to lead the Department of Education . Linda McMahon is also awaiting confirmation to serve as small business administrator . There is only one women in the Cabinet who does not require a Senate confirmation Kellyanne Conway who is Chief Counselor to POTUS . <p> The rest of the Cabinet is comprised of 27 men , the vast majority of them white . <p> Elise Jordan , who is not known for necessarily delivering scathing hot takes on Morning Joe , spoke candidly about the breakdown of Trump 's appointees . " I 'm tired of hearing how Trump is so great about promoting women and then you have very few women at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in government , " Elise Jordan said . " How is he staffing his government ? " <p> Brzezinski added , " Where 's the presence of women ? Where 's the influence of women at the table ? It 's just not present . " <p> Brown went further in her criticism of our Commander in Chief however . " Where 's the respect for women , which we saw none of during the campaign ? " The exchange came after the panel played clips from the Audi Super Bowl commercial which championed workplace equity . Watch above via MSNBC. -- image via screengrab 
 <p> Outside of blaming holdovers from the Obama Administration for providing details to the media , the president also stated that they were working on getting them replaced . Right now , per POTUS , they are searching " very , very hard " for the leakers because he thinks what they are doing is " dangerous . " <p> " It 's a disgrace that they leaked because it 's very much against our country , " Trump said , without stating why he believed that career civil servants who work in Democratic and Republican administrations were the source of the leaks . " It 's a very dangerous thing for this country , " he said . <p> Last week , it was reported that Trump 's phone call with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull was highly contentious , with POTUS using the conversation to brag about his Electoral College win and berate Turnbull over a refugee agreement reached between the two countries . It was further noted that the call lasted only 25 minutes despite being scheduled for an hour . ( The White House would later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calls to world leaders. ) 
 <p> The host of The Late Show on CBS devoted one of his desk segments Monday night to tackling the President 's insistence that " millions of illegals " cast ballots in the general election , calling the string of allegations what they are . <p> " This kind of accusation is called -- and I do n't want to get too technical here -- bullshit , " said Stephen Colbert to cheers from the crowd at the Ed Sullivan Theater . <p> " In fact , the largest investigation into voter impersonation ever found just 31 incidents out of one billion ballots cast , " he continued Monday . " By the way , 31 out of a billion is also my Yelp review for the Trump administration . " <p> President Donald Trump continued to defend his long-held , confusing belief during his first Super Bowl Sunday interview with Fox News ' Bill O'Reilly , who pushed the Commander in Chief in presenting substantial evidence to support his claims . <p> Colbert revealed that other investigations surrounding the 2016 election found only four documented cases of voter fraud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three million , " Colbert said , before invoking the recurring bit from his Colbert Report days of crunching numbers on an old-school printing calculator . 
 <h> A Woman Has Left Her Husband of 22 Years Because He Voted For Trump <p> No , this is n't fake news and no , we ca n't think of a fun way to lead into this story . <p> According to Reuters , a retired prison guard named Gayle McCormick has divorced her husband after 22 years of marriage . She called his revelation a " deal breaker " and said she felt " betrayed . " <p> " It totally undid me that he could vote for Trump . I felt like I had been fooling myself , " she said . " It opened up areas between us I had not faced before . I realized how far I had gone in my life to accept things I would have never accepted when I was younger . " <p> Check out the results of a Reuters poll on interpersonal relationships in the post-election world here . 
 <p> Senator Elizabeth Warren was reprimanded on the Senate floor tonight for a speech she delivered railing against Senate colleague and AG nominee Jeff Sessions . <p> At issue here was her quoting of incredibly critical words that Ted Kennedy and Coretta Scott King used in the past to oppose Sessions when he was up for a judgeship in the 80s . ( You can read King 's letter here . ) <p> Warren was initially warned not to impugn another senator 's motives by Senator Steve Daines , the presiding officer tonight , in violation of Rule 19 of the Senate , which , in part , says this : <p> No Senator in debate shall , directly or indirectly , by any form of words impute to another Senator or to other Senators any conduct or motive unworthy or unbecoming a Senator . <p> Warren expressed some bewilderment that quoting King and Kennedy " is a violation of Senate rules . " <p> Daines said that it is , and he just warned her to be aware of this rule . <p> Warren continued , but a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell interjected and said she has " impugned the motives and conduct of our colleague from Alabama . " <p> He invoked Rule 19 , and Warren immediately responded , " I am surprised that the words of Coretta Scott King are not suitable for debate in the United States Senate . I ask leave of the Senate to continue my remarks . " <p> McConnell immediately objected and Daines told Warren to take her seat . Warren immediately appealed the ruling . <p> The Senate eventually took a vote tonight and voted 49-43 upholding the ruling that she violated Rule 19 . <p> Earlier in the night , Warren took to Twitter to denounce what occurred , and her Democratic colleagues joined in to get #LetLizSpeak going : <p> Tonight on the Senate floor , I tried to speak about why @SenatorSessions is totally unfit to serve as Attorney General . 
 <p> Last night , CNN aired a rather unique live broadcast experiment : a one-on-one debate between Vermont senator Bernie Sanders and Ted Cruz of Texas about the Affordable Care Act and the future of socialized medicine in the United States . <p> In keeping with many of the Town Hall-style events that the network has bullishly aired as of late , the event , moderated by Jake Tapper and Dana Bash , included questions from the crowd . But keen Reddit users noticed that one of the women appeared to read off her contribution from a printed sheet of paper that included the words , " Your Question " at the top . <p> As the first hour of the event drew to a close , Tapper introduced Carol Hardaway , who he identified as , " One of the Americans who benefitted from Obamacare 's Medicaid expansion . " The Salisbury , Maryland native proceeded to stand up and direct her question at Senator Cruz , saying : <p> I have Multiple Sclerosis , but could not afford insurance . Without the treatment of medications I need , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my vision . When the Affordable Care Act was passed , I moved from our home in Texas because they refused to expand medicaid , to Maryland . And in two weeks , I started to receive treatments through medicaid , and I 'm well enough to work as a substitute teacher . Senator Cruz , can you promise me that you and the Republican leaders in Congress will actually have a replacement plan in place for people like me who depend on their medicaid . In other words , I like my coverage . Can I keep it ? <p> But Hardaway clearly read off her question from a sheet of paper that looks as if it was printed from her personal G-Mail account ; at the top of that sheet of paper are the words " Your Question " in bold . <p> Hill agreed to submit two questions that he characterized as " fluffy . " CNN selected one Hill had drafted based on the HBO comedy series " Veep . " <p> He recalled the question he was supposed to ask : " One of my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' In the show , Julia Louis-Dreyfus ' character is subjected to a lot of ridiculous and embarrassing campaign events by her staff that she does n't enjoy in order to secure votes . I was wondering if you could relate to us a time when maybe you felt ridiculous or embarrassed on the campaign trail and if there is anyone you would like to call out for putting you in that situation ? " <p> After being called on by Jake Tapper at the event , Hill said out loud , " But given the dire circumstances ? I 'm so sorry Mr. Tapper ? given the dire circumstances our country is in , I wonder if you would indulge me in a little bit more of a serious question about the future of the Democratic Party , " before launching into his question about the party 's approach to capitalism . <p> A CNN spokesperson said in response , " To ensure we cover a variety of topics , we asked him if he had a personal ( non-policy ) question he wanted to ask the House Minority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A spokesperson for CNN tells Mediaite , " Audience members ask their own questions . Their questions are printed so they can easily read them live on television . Our team works with them to trim questions for timing and to ensure we cover a variety of topics and that there is no overlap . " 
 <p> " A staffer asked Conway whether she 'd seen ' Saturday Night Live 's ' lampooning of White House press secretary Sean Spicer over the weekend , " they report . " Asked whether she 'd laughed at the portrayal , Conway 's face ' turned to stone , ' according to another source in the room . A senior White House official said Conway did n't comment on the SNL video but that her face had n't turn to stone . " <p> " They definitely did not find it funny , " the House source told Politico . " And then they walked out . " 
 <h> Lady Gaga Responds to Body Shamers : ' I 'm Proud of My Body ' <p> Lady Gaga 's Super Bowl halftime show was pretty epic . The show , which featured over 100 drones and most of Gaga 's hits , was widely praised on Twitter , Instagram , and in the media as well . It was inclusive , like she said it would be , and her voice was on point . Not that it needs to be discussed but , yes , her body also looked amazing . <p> Apparently not everyone felt that way . Some actually saw the need to focus on what she looked like , rather than how she sounded and the message she sent . Gaga is hitting back via Instagram to let her fans and critics know she 's not ashamed . <p> " I 'm proud of my body , " she writes , " And you should be proud of yours too . No matter who you are or what you do . I could give you a million reasons why you do n't need to cater @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and be relentlessly you . That 's the stuff of champions . Thank you so much everyone for supporting me. " 
 <p> Golden State Warriors superstar Stephen Curry was highly critical of Under Armour CEO Kevin Plank for calling President Donald Trump a " real asset " to the country during an interview with CNBC . <p> " I agree with that description , " Curry told the Mercury News , " If you remove the ' et . ' " <p> Curry , who is sponsored by Under Armour , said that he would have no problem severing ties with a brand whose leaders , he felt , did not share his " core values . " <p> If there is a situation where I can look at myself in the mirror and say they do n't have my best intentions , they do n't have the right attitude about taking care of people , if I can say the leadership is not in line with my core values , then there is no amount of money , there is no platform I would n't jump off if it was n't in line with who I am . So that 's a decision I will make every single day when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with what I 'm about , then , yeah , I definitely need to take a stance in that respect . <p> Under Armour released a statement in which they said " we engage in policy , not politics . " Curry said he was pleased by the statement , and planned to continue his relationship with the company . <p> " Based off the release that Kevin Plank sent out this morning , and what he told me last night , that 's the Under Armour that I know , " Curry said . " That 's the brand I know he 's built and one that , as of Wednesday afternoon , is something that I 'm standing on . " 
 <p> Clinton Cash author Peter The Washington Post Thursday that the Trump administration had " crossed a very , very important bright line and it 's not good . To encourage Americans to buy goods from companies owned by the first family is totally out of bounds and needs to stop . " <p> " These marketing battles need to be fought by Ivanka and her company . They can not and should not be fought by government employees and the White House , " he continued . " It 's time to move beyond the mindset and the role of a businessman and assume the mantle of commander of chief . " <p> Schweizer 's criticism is striking given that he used to work for Breitbart and reportedly has close ties to top Trump official Steve Bannon . Nonetheless , his assessment comes after he also called for Trump to divest from his companies before taking office . 
 <h> REPORT : Rupert Murdoch Secretly Sat in on Times of London Interview With Trump <p> A report from The Financial Times indicates that Rupert Murdoch the longtime News Corp Chairman who just so happens to also be the acting CEO of Fox News now was secretly sitting just off-camera during an interview last month at Trump Tower between the then-president-elect and the Times of London . <p> As we detailed at the time , the interview occurred just days before the inauguration between Donald Trump , Michael Gove of The Times , and Kai Diekmann of the German newspaper Bild ; the wide-ranging on-the-record talk touched on the relationship between the US and Britain , as well as the future of the European Union and taxing German automotive maker BMW . <p> But one thing that was conveniently left out of the final reporting of the interview was the fact that Murdoch was secretly in the room the whole time . The Times is owned by News UK , the media entity run by News Corp , which is run directly by Murdoch himself . <p> And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ailes from Fox News last year , Murdoch largely occupied the power vacuum left at the top ; although Bill Shine and Bill Abernethy were installed to serve as co-presidents , Murdoch has since served as acting CEO of the American cable network . <p> The optics here are now considerably shaped as a result of the Financial Times ' original reporting ; while the soon-to-be president was offering his first interview to foreign media companies about the future and development of global relations , the most powerful man at Fox News was sitting just inches away . Photos of the interview that were subsequently released only included the president-elect , Gove , and Diekmann , with no reference to Murdoch 's looming secretive presence . <p> During that interview , Trump touted Britain 's decision to leave the European Union as a tremendous success , saying , " If you ask me , more countries will leave . " He also touted the potential for trade pacts with the UK , offering , " We 're gon na work very hard to get the trade deal done quickly and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continued to Gove that day , " We 'll have a meeting right after I get into the White House and it 'll be , I think we 're gon na get something done very quickly . " 
 <p> As we mentioned yesterday , big winter weather storms that wallop the East Coast mean it 's time for local news reporters to brave the elements and give the latest updates from the frigid field . <p> But a little bit of inclement weather did n't stop one prankster from donning an incredibly legitimate Big Foot ensemble and crashing a live shot on 22 News in Springfield , Massachusetts . Just as meteorologist Jennifer Pagliei was beginning her news report from a hectic intersection known simply as " The X " down the road from the Basketball Hall of Fame , the emerging creature can be seen creeping scarily into frame . <p> " Since the snow started this morning at about 6:15 , 6:30 , it has not let up at all , " said Pagliei . The creepy creature who one 22 News anchor referred to as " Sasquatch " horrifyingly trudges towards the frame of the camera . <p> The cameraman quickly motions for Pagliei to step out of the frame so that he can adjust the direction of the focus , depriving us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But this head-scratching encounter leaves so many questions unanswered , namely WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT ? ! and WHO THE HELL OWNS THAT COSTUME ? ! and WHAT THE HELL DOES HE/SHE DO WITH THAT COSTUME WHILE NOT REPORTERS LIVE ON-AIR ? ! 
 <p> According to the Wall Street Journal , internal documents from Nordstrom show that Ivanka Trump 's fashion brand saw major declines in sales in the last fiscal year . The drop became even more pronounced the closer they got towards the election . <p> Per the data , sales of the line plummeted 32% for the year overall . Through the last three weeks of October , the falloff was 70% when compared to the same time the previous year . <p> Earlier this month , it was announced by the retail chain that they were no longer going to carry the brand due to declining sales . Days after the announcement , President Donald to Twitter to express his disgust with the decision , stating that his daughter had " been treated so unfairly . " <p> My daughter Ivanka has been treated so unfairly by @Nordstrom . She is a great person always pushing me to do the right thing ! Terrible ! <p> Ethical concerns about conflicts of interest , especially since the official @POTUS account retweeted it , were exacerbated when White House @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Ivanka Trump 's products , urging people to " go buy Ivanka 's stuff " while declaring how great the line was . 
 <p> Josh Elliott 's new role with CBS is now officially over almost as soon as it began . <p> Elliot , the former Good Morning America anchor who moved onto NBC briefly before settling nicely into a gig with CBS digital , announced on Friday that he would be moving onto platforms of higher visibility for The Eye . " It has been by any measure a great stay here at CBSN , " he said on Friday . <p> The problem ? None of the bigwigs at CBS knew Elliott was going to make an announcement like this ; as one network source told the New York Post , " This is a mess of epic proportions . Nobody at the top at CBS News knew that Josh was going to do that . " <p> Before the announcement , Elliott had been serving as the daytime anchor for CBSN , but after meeting with the network 's head of talent he suddenly made his shocking announcement on Friday .

 <h> O'Reilly : The Press Is ' Smearing ' Trump With Coverage of ICE Raids <p> Bill O'Reilly said tonight that the press ' dishonesty may have reached a peak in their coverage of the recent Immigration and Customs Enforcement raids in " smearing " President Trump . <p> Hundreds of people were arrested in the recent raids , which garnered a lot of media attention . DHS Secretary John Kelly released a statement today saying that 75 percent of those arrested in the raids were criminals convicted of things ranging from homicide , sexual assault , and drug trafficking . <p> O'Reilly went through some of the stats before saying the facts have gone " largely unreported by the American press , " saying that the coverage has " reached the level of hysteria . " <p> He said he did n't see much coverage mentioning criminals being targeted and said , " That 's not press bias , that 's blatant dishonesty . " He also took note of how there was n't this kind of outrage after the raids that took place under President Obama . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " has been set up by the media to demonize Mr. Trump as a racist and a brutalizer of the poor . That 's what 's really going on here , a set-up . " 
 <p> Well , it appears another powerful committee chairman has similar thoughts when it comes to the brewing political scandal . <p> Speaking to reporters this morning , House Oversight Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz ( R-UT ) let it be know that he was n't interested in looking any further into Flynn , who resigned as National Security Adviser late last night in wake of reports that he communicated with the Russian ambassador on sanctions prior to President Donald Trump 's inauguration. 
 <p> Flynn left his position late last night due to the controversy surrounding his misleading the Trump administration about conversations he had with Russian officials . As far as WikiLeaks is concerned , Flynn was just a casualty of the " destabilization campaign " coming the media and the Democratic Party among others : <p> WikiLeaks played a major part in his victory due to their release of damaging and embarrassing information about Hillary Clinton , her colleagues , and the Democratic National Committee , according to many Trump critics . In those days , WikiLeaks was encouraging government officials to " leak early , leak often . " 
 <h> One of the Things We Learned From Mike Flynn 's Resignation is That Kellyanne Conway 's a Fraud <p> It took less than a month , but we already ( finally ? ) have a major resignation from within President Trump 's inner circle , Mike Flynn as National Security Advisor . As I discussed with David Frum on my weekly Sunday podcast , this was something that , given the factual record , I was amazed had not already happened . <p> There are many important aspects to this story . Did Trump know about or facilitate Flynn 's call to Russia and his subsequent lying to Vice President Pence about it ? Why are Republican leaders going out of their way to not fully investigate this potentially very serious matter ? Why ca n't press secretary Sean Spicer remotely explain the timeline of events or logic behind how it was finally decided that Flynn would resign ? What does all of this say about Trump 's self-proclaimed magic touch when it comes to hiring the " best " people , which many voters hung their hat on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Trump is supposedly a genius who tweets distractions so we wo n't focus on other more damaging stories , why has he been incredibly quiet the last two days on Twitter ? <p> All of these are extremely compelling questions which I may take up in the future ( I wish I trusted that the news media was competent enough , and the Trump administration transparent enough , to make sure we eventually got sensible answers ) . However , right now I want to examine what all of this Flynn business says about Trump 's most famous " counselor , " Kellyanne Conway . <p> In short , I believe we now know that she is largely a fraud . <p> What I mean by this is that I no longer believe that she is truly in Trump 's most inner circle of advisors , nor do I think she is in the loop on critical decision-making . I have long suspected this to be the case for two basic reasons . First , she spends way too much time on television to possibly be involved in everything going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appearance with Anderson Cooper regarding the " Russian Dossier " was the first clear sign to me she was out of the loop ) . Secondly , she brags way too much about her access to the president and how important she really is . <p> Anyone who understands basic human nature realizes that when people brag , it is usually a sign of tremendous insecurity . Really rich guys do n't need to tell you how wealthy they are ( thus eliminating Donald Trump ) . Guys who talk a lot about sexual exploits are likely inadequate in that area . And people who desperately want you to know that they are very significant figures are probably running a scam . <p> I have always been struck by Conway 's remarkable insecurity and desperate need for attention . It seems that this quality in her was the inspiration for SNL 's " Fatal Attraction " skit from this Saturday . As with most frauds , if you put them under pressure and keep close enough watch , the truth will eventually come out . It seems this is exactly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Here is a quick review : <p> Yesterday , not long before Flynn resigned ( and long after all the relevant information was already known ) Conway claimed that Flynn had Trump 's full support . This was after refusing to comment on his situation over the weekend . It now seems like she was simply guessing all along . <p> She then felt the need to publicly respond to those who were starting to notice her very bad day and putting together the pieces of a puzzle which add up to her being remarkably irrelevant . <p> Then , in what had to be a remarkably easy decision , the Office of Government Ethics recommended she face disciplinary action for turning the White House into a QVC studio on behalf of Ivanka Trump ( an act which so dripped of her feelings of insecurity with regard to her position with the president that you could almost smell it through the television screen ) . <p> You hardly ever see Steve Bannon doing interviews or boasting even on background to a reporter about his level of influence . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like to talk ( he used to host a radio talk show ! ) . It is mostly because , like the guy with biggest bank , he has no need to prove to anyone how essential he is to Trump . <p> Conway is very unlikely to be ousted by Trump ( unless this ethics issue really blows up ) . She is by far the most prominent female advisor , other than his daughter Ivanka , that Trump has . She is also a very loyal and famous person , which are his two favorite qualities in a person . She really has nothing to fear , and that makes her extreme anxiety much more striking and noteworthy . <p> The news media has been urgently searching for the best way to handle Conway and her fondness for " alternative facts " ( while also admitting that Trump himself often lies ) . Perhaps they now have enough evidence to simply not take her seriously , or just ignore her completely . 
 <p> Erickson begins the piece saying that " The press has largely brought it upon themselves , " because he 's " lost count of the stories reported by the media and retracted or modified substantially in the same day . " But , he says , Gateway Pundit is a different animal altogether . " I 'm not sure there is a greater purveyor of fake news on the left or right than that site , " he says . <p> From malarkey about terrorism to showing NBA fans as Trump supporters to you name it , Gateway Pundit runs nonsense and I still have not determined if it is intentional or just because of some level of insanity . 
 <p> It would appear as if President Donald Trump 's longstanding argument that CNN is the home of " fake news " has officially permeated to other members of the Republican party . <p> Iowa Congressman Steve King appeared on that very network Wednesday morning and suggested to New Day anchor Alisyn Camerota point blank that any notion of Kremlin interference with the general election was simply a figment of CNN 's imagination . <p> The subject was brought up after a tweet early this morning by Trump , who attempted to loosely tie together " this Russian connection non-sense " to " Hillary Clinton 's losing campaign . " <p> In response , Congressman King offered , " I think it 's a CNN narrative that the allegations that the Russians were trying to influence the US election between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton , " King offered . <p> " Hold on a minute ! CNN did n't invent this ! " exclaimed Camerota in response . " As you know , there was a score of intelligence agencies seventeen of them -- that concluded that Russia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Alisyn , there was dissent among that , " King said in return , indicating that the reports from the intel community were purely opinion-based with no factual or anecdotal evidence to support it . <p> " Just so I 'm clear Congressman : you do not believe that Russia meddled ? " Camerota asked . <p> Congressman King returned serve by saying simply , " I do n't know . I do n't have -- I do n't know if they meddled or not . I want to see a transcript ; I was to hear some audio . " <p> Watch above , via CNN . <p> image via screengrab <p> -- J.D. Durkin ( @jivedurkey ) is an editorial producer and columnist at Mediaite. 
 <p> Both Reince Priebus and Steve Bannon denied that Spicer was in the doghouse , saying that he had the " full confidence " of the president . Priebus suggested the rumors were being spread by a low-level staffer , while Bannon suggested that " the media , the opposition party " was simply telling lies . <p> " Many people sympathetic to Spicer in and out of the White House believe otherwise , " Byers reports . " Five of these sources think the person behind the leaks is Kellyanne Conway , Trump 's ever-visible White House counselor . Though they offer no hard evidence , they say Conway is trying to offload blame for administration setbacks on Spicer to prove she is the more effective public advocate ... " <p> Conway of course denies the charge . " Absolutely not , " she said in a statement . " It 's absolutely false . Sean has my full support , but most importantly , he has the president 's full support . We work as a team . " 
 <p> Manigault , a former reality show star , has said that an unnamed colleague of hers recorded the conversation between her and Ryan , which occurred last week in the White House . According to Ryan 's account of the encounter , Omarosa attempted to " physically intimidate " her while explaining that she was collecting compromising information on the White House correspondent . <p> However , Manigault told WaPo that it was actually Ryan who was the bully in the confrontation : <p> " She came in to the White House area hot , " hurling insults at her , Manigault said . " She came in with an attitude . For her to characterize me as the bully I 'm so glad we have this tape ... because it 's ' liar , liar , pants on fire ' " in Ryan 's case , Manigault said . <p> Several reporters , including Fox News ' John Roberts , have listened to portions of the tape . Roberts said the parts he heard included " terse words and accusations , " but it did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noted that he did n't hear the word " dossier . " <p> In response to the recording and sharing of a tape that was made without her knowledge , Ryan compared it to the era of Richard Nixon . <p> Ryan said she was not aware that her run-in with Manigault last week was recorded . " I did n't know she was taping it , " she said . " This is about her trying to smear my name . This is freaking Nixonian . " <p> Ryan further noted that Omarosa only shared selected pieces of the conversation with reporters because she wants to " spin it like a catfight " and that it is " about her smearing me. " 
 <p> During this today 's broadcast of CNN 's The Lead , host Jake Tapper took aim at President Donald Trump 's continuing war with the mainstream media , who the president now blames for the ouster of former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn . <p> Pointing out that the president today attacked reports surrounding Trump advisers being in contact with Russian intelligence officials , Tapper highlighted the fact that White House press secretary Sean Spicer said yesterday that Trump specifically pushed Flynn out over an erosion of trust . However , during a news conference today , Trump called Flynn " a wonderful man " who had been treated " unfairly " by the " fake media . " <p> He continued , " What the media did do was reveal to the nation that General Flynn had lied to the country and to the Trump team including Vice President Pence when he claimed he never discussed Obama 's sanctions on Russia with the Russian ambassador . " <p> The CNN anchor would go on to discuss Trump 's recent Twitter attacks on the " fake news @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ POTUS publicly embracing conspiracy theories in the past . Tapper would also argue that in the past Trump had no problem with leaks when they benefited him . 
 <p> Naturally , Maher inviting Yiannopoulos on his show was bound to raise eyebrows , but one of the other guests Maher booked for the same show has withdrawn . <p> The Intercept founding editor Jeremy Scahill , who has been a guest on Maher 's show numerous times over the years , explained that while he has been happy to appear on the show despite their tough disagreements on some issues . <p> But Yiannopoulos was just too much for him . You can read his statement below : 
 <p> Back in 2009 , Tea Partiers mobilized pretty early on against President Obama . And now , as one Democratic senator said this week , the same thing is happening on the left less than a month into President Trump 's term . <p> CNN 's flagged audio from Senator Claire McCaskill 's interview on The Mark Reardon Show yesterday , in which she talked about running for re-election next year . <p> However , she added , " I may have a primary because there is , in our party now , some of the same kind of enthusiasm at the base that the Republican party had with the Tea Party . " <p> She brought up how people are " impatient " with her for not being " pure " enough , saying , " They think I should be voting against all of Trump 's nominees and of course I 'm judging each nominee on its own merit . " <p> McCaskill recently got flak for saying President Trump 's Supreme Court nominee , Neil Gorsuch , should be given a full confirmation process and get voted on . 
 <p> As a life-long conservative who has plenty of battle scars from very real skirmishes with the and truth-challenged news media , Trump 's attacks on them are , for me , by far the most conflicting and ultimately demoralizing element of his presidency . Normally , the enemy of your enemy is your friend , but I see Trump as being the very unworthy beneficiary of the righteous suffering of others . <p> As I have said before , I feel very much like a poor black person in South Los Angeles must have when O.J. Simpson used blatantly absurd claims of LAPD racism to get away with murdering two people . Similarly , I have seen Trump masterfully manipulate conservatives who have been trained for decades to rightfully distrust the news media and use that sentiment for his own selfish purposes , all at the long-term cost of their own cause . <p> So now the major news media ( excluding those outlets favorable to him like Fox News Channel , which are now part of the state-approved media ) are the " enemy " of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effort to try to make his base of support feel as if they are part of this fight and that when he takes on the media he is doing it for them and not , as it may appear to someone paying attention to what he actually says , just him ( although I doubt too many of those who bought red " MAGA " hats really care much about his favorite attack topics , like the size of his election victory or inauguration crowd ) . <p> It should go without saying that Trump 's statement was grossly inappropriate for a man holding the highest office in the land which required him to take an oath to uphold the Constitution , and thus the First Amendment . However , we are now living in an age where " inappropriateness " alone no longer moves our outrage meter , or even really matters at all . <p> I have great personal disdain for the mainstream news media . I think they have allowed journalism and our culture 's value of the truth to die in an evil exchange for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't think they are the " enemy " of the " American people , " at least not in their intent . The vast majority of them just want to be able to keep their cushy jobs without having to take too many risks or work too hard . <p> All that being said , there are indeed times when Trump 's analysis of the news media is EFFECTIVELY true . Ironically , I ca n't think of a better example of this than their treatment of Trump himself . <p> Can we please not forget that NONE of which we are currently facing ever comes close to happening if the news media had n't done at least the following things : <p> Pretended for years that Trump was a real billionaire ( and thus an important person ) simply because he was a good character to use in their stories . <p> Sucked up so much to Barack Obama for eight years and personally portrayed two very fine Republican opponents as monsters , so that they lost all credibility for when it really mattered . <p> Allowed Trump 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good for ratings during a slow news period in the summer of 2015 . <p> Gave Trump over two billion dollars in free air time during the primaries because he was good for ratings and because they figured he could n't win the nomination and if he did , that would still be cool because it would ensure a Hillary Clinton victory . <p> Grossly overhyped the letter by FBI Director James Comey eleven days before the election because they thought the conclusion had already been decided and they wanted to squeeze out some more drama all the way up until the end ( and boy did they get it ! ) . <p> What is most interesting to me about this " war " between Trump and the news media is that they both need each other so very badly . Without the media to kick around , Trump would have to focus his ire on Democrats , which would be difficult both because they are in the minority , and in reality he is one of them . Similarly , the news media on the one hand is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him because he provides the two of the elements they carve most : easy content and big audiences . <p> In a sense , Trump is like a dirt-bag drug dealer giving the news media their fix or a rich boyfriend who abuses his partner . They despise him for what he is doing , but they simply ca n't quit him . <p> I have a theory that one of the reasons Trump understands the news media so very well ( and thus is able to manipulate them like no one else in political history ) is that he is so much like the average modern reporter . He is not very bright but has a short attention span , likes a good/easy narrative , has no interest in details , puts little value on morals , and just wants to be rich and famous . <p> Part of this theory is that one of the reasons that Trump is so positive that the media is dumb and corrupt is that he is amazed at what they have allowed him to get away with through the years . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the United States , all while pretending to oppose him ( I 'm still convinced much of the news media was conflicted because they knew how awesome his presidency would be for them personally ) has probably solidified in his mind forever that he is right about the media . <p> Groucho Marx once famously said that he never wanted to be a member of a club that would let him in . Likewise , it 's very possible that Trump will never respect the news media for the very reason that they allowed him to dupe them until it was too late . And it was n't even that difficult . 
 <h> REPORT : National Security Council Aide Dismissed After His Criticisms of Trump <p> Following the resignation of Michael Flynn , a senior aide to the National Security Council was reportedly dismissed yesterday because of critical words he had for President Trump and Steve Bannon . <p> Craig Deare , according to Politico , sounded off on the administration during a private roundtable hosted by the Woodrow Wilson Center : <p> Deare harshly criticized the president and his chief strategist Steve Bannon and railed against the dysfunction paralyzing the Trump White House , according to a source familiar with the situation . <p> He complained in particular that senior national security aides do not have access to the president and gave a detailed and embarrassing readout of Trump 's call with Mexican president Enrique Pena Nieto . <p> The Politico report says that the White House dismissed Deare after being informed of " reports that he had publicly laced into the president and his senior aides , including son-in-law Jared Kushner and daughter Ivanka Trump . " 
 <p> Despite his public scandal a few years ago , Petraeus is still highly-regarded enough by President Trump and many around him to be considered for the post vacated after Michael Flynn 's resignation . <p> Trump had initially settled on retired Vice Admiral Robert Harward who turned down the position . Harward will be on ABC 's This Week tomorrow to speak out for the first time since that decision , but so far there 's been reporting he turned down the position because 1 ) the White House did n't meet his conditions , and 2 ) he watched Trump 's press conference this week . <p> Former CIA director David Petraeus said anyone considering the national security adviser job in the Trump administration should have control over personnel and the White House would commit to a disciplined process of crafting security policy ... An official briefed on the search for a NSC adviser said Mr. Petraeus was no longer being considered because the White House thought his demands were unreasonable . 
 <h> Did Trump Think There Was an Attack in Sweden Because of a Tucker Carlson Segment ? <p> Trump said a lot of ridiculous things at Saturday 's rally at the Orlando Melbourne International Airport . Among those things was his improper use of " good " ( when he actually meant " well " ) " He 'll do so good , " in reference to newly appointed EAP head Scott Pruitt and his gross mispronunciation of the word " chasm . " But things would take an especially head-scratching turn when Trump would make reference to an incident " last night in Sweden . " <p> A quick Google search turns up a whopping zero results for any combination of the search words " incident , " " attack , " Sweden , " and " February 18 . " <p> Please enable Javascript to watch . <p> What Trump seems to be referencing is actually a segment that aired last night on Tucker Carlson about a documentarian and the film he made regarding immigration in Sweden . ( If we 're splitting hairs , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only aired last night . But there 's no need to nitpick . ) <p> Ami Horowitz 's film documents Sweden 's open door policy where refugees are concerned , as well as the unprecedented rise in crime seemingly as a result . He goes on to detail that the Swedish government is , by and large , trying to cover up the insurgence in crime . <p> Great . While this certainly sounds like something that needs to be brought to the mainstream media 's attention , it certainly is n't indicative of an " incident " occurring in Sweden last night . <p> Who 's to say that this is n't just a coincidence ? Some funny , odd , specific coincidence that has happen repeatedly and regularly over the last three months . It could be . It could also be indicative of POTUS thinking that Fox and Friends is more credible than his daily intelligence briefing . But who 's to say for certain ? <p> Maybe someone should run a segment on Fox News asking POTUS to take a selfie while throwing the peace sign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if all of this were an incredibly amazing coincidence or Trump 's simply being a Fox News stan . 
 <p> Veteran journalist and Watergate reporter Carl Bernstein hammered President Trump today for saying that the political media is the " enemy of the American people . " <p> The president is getting significantblowback recently , both for blasting the press during his Thursday press conference , and for a tweet yesterday that lists several major outlets as " the enemy . " Bernstein has been critical of Trump for months , and he now says that Trump 's slams against the press are now on a " more treacherous " level than Richard Nixon : <p> The most dangerous ' enemy of the people ' is presidential lying always . Attacks on press by @realDonaldTrump more treacherous than 
 <p> The fallout of President Donald Trump 's comments on Saturday implying there was a terror attack in Sweden the night before is not just landing on him . The segment on Fox News Channel 's " Tucker Carlson Tonight " that aired did happen Friday , as well as Ami Horowitz , the documentary filmmaker featured therein that started all of this , are now coming under further scrutiny . On Monday , Swedish newspaper Dagens Nyheter ran an interview with two police officers who were featured in Horowitz 's documentary , who are both claiming that their answers were edited out of context . <p> " It was supposed to be about crime in high risk areas , " said Jacob ? m , one of the two officers . " Areas with high crime rates . There was n't any focus on migration or immigration . " He further explained that Horowitz " edited the answers " since " we were answering completely different questions in the interview . " His colleague Anders G ? added that " It feels like hell . The real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> In the clip of the interview that was aired on " Tucker Carlson Tonight , " there a noticeable difference in the audio quality and amount of background noise between Horowitz 's questions and the officers ' answers . <p> When asked if they had done anything to " stop the news segment , " ? m said that 's what they were doing right there at that moment . " We just saw it , " he said . " What can we do ? One thing is talking to you . The excerpt they showed does n't say anything , we answered a different question . We do n't stand behind what he says . He is a madman . " <p> Dagens Nyheter reached out to Horowitz for a comment on the story but has not yet received a response . 
 <p> The White House was forced to backtrack off an initial statement that President Donald Trump played just a " couple of holes " of golf on Sunday , following a report that he played a full round . <p> According to the golf website No Laying Up , one of Trump 's playing companions -- four-time major champion Rory McIlroy said that the President played a full round at his golf course in West Palm Beach , FL . <p> " He probably shot around 80 , " McIlroy told the website . " He 's a decent player for a guy in his 70 's ! " <p> The group also included former New York Yankees player Paul O'Neill , and Clear Sports CEO Garry Singer . The Clear Sports Twitter account released a photo of the foursome . <p> At issue here is the amount of time Trump was on the course . A " couple of holes , " as the White House initially said , likely would 've taken less than an hour . Whereas a complete round probably would 've gone in excess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his first 32 days as President , Trump has golfed six different times -- including , according to The New York Times , a 27-hole outing with Japan Prime Minster Shinzo Abe last week at two different Trump courses . <p> Prior to running for President , Trump regularly criticized then-President Barack Obama for being on the golf course too often . <p> President Obama has a major meeting on the N.Y.C. Ebola outbreak , with people flying in from all over the country , but decided to play golf ! 
 <h> ' It Was Surreal ' : Here 's the Inside Story of the Cubs ' Dramatic Team Meeting During the World Series Rain Delay <p> " It was surreal , " Chicago Cubs general manager Theo Epstein said . And truly , it was . With the Cubs bidding to win their first World Series since 1908 , the decisive seventh game was tied 6-6 going to the 10th inning , when play was called to a halt for a rain delay . The teams retreated to their clubhouses , and for 17 minutes , they were forced to wait out the storm while the biggest game of their lives was put on hold . <p> As part of filming for a feature HBO produced for this month 's episode of Real Sports which is set to premiere tomorrow night -- host Bryant Gumbel sat down with Epstein and Cubs manager Joe Maddon to get the inside story of how the team spent those 17 minutes in limbo . As with almost everything else that happened at Progressive Field in Cleveland that night , the scene could 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the skipper and the general manager , all 25 players on the Cubs ' roster gathered for an impromptu team meeting in the weight room . <p> " I hustled down to our clubhouse , " Epstein said . " And I thought ' What is going on over there ? Why are 25 players in the weight room during a rain delay ? ' So I went close and I could hear Jason Heyward , and Anthony Rizzo , and David Ross , and Dexter Fowler among others were speaking up very passionately about who we are , what we 've been through to this point , what we stand for , and what we were gon na do in the top of the 10th inning to go win this game . And it was a really , really dramatic , emotional moment . " <p> Maddon said the meeting gave him confidence that his club was going to pull off the historic victory . <p> " The guys were , like , chirpy with a good look , " Maddon said . " ' Okay . We 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the right look . " 
 <p> Which is to say , the shot itself is n't enough to warrant attention . Something else has to happen . <p> This one , from Valparaiso 's Micah Bradford , would seem to qualify . <p> During his team 's game against Detroit Mercy on Sunday , Bradford launched a shot from just beyond the half-court circle . The shot was way off , missing high by several feet and striking the shot clock above the basket . The ricochet actually knocked the ball even higher in the air . <p> But somehow when it came down , the ball struck the front rim . It gently bounced off the glass and remarkably fell through the basket . <p> Unfortunately for Bradford and Valparaiso , the incredible shot did n't count . Bounces off the shot clock are n't allowed . Still , this one can be categorized as an increasingly rare attention-grabbing half court shot . 
 <p> CNN 's Don Lemon interviewed Ami Horowitz Monday night about his YouTube documentary Stockholm Syndrome and the unexpected uproar it has caused after President Trump egregiously claimed an incident had occurred " Friday night in Sweden " after watching a Tucker Carlson segment featuring the doc . <p> " Let 's talk about the numbers , " Lemon said in reference to Horowitz 's film 's accusation that there was a sharp increase in violent crimes " over the last few years in Sweden " all of which could be traced back to immigrants . " We looked at the stats from the U.S. State Department . Here 's what we learned : Crime rose about 7% from 2015 ; much of that was non-violent computer fraud and vandalism . In 2015 violent crime would decrease slightly , " Lemon would claim of the facts he had complied . He would continue : " Where did you get your information and did you get the official numbers ? " <p> Horowitz claims that his stats came from the Swedish Br ? , an agency under the Ministry of Justice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He also claimed that he was speaking solely of " heavy crime murder and sexual assault " in terms of those crimes that have seen a dramatic increase , while Lemon turns his argument to the fact that there does n't seem to be " a correlation between immigrants and a spike in crime . " He would go further to say that " there is no huge spike in crime there . " <p> Lemon would then point out that while crime fluctuated between 2006 and 2015 there was no " spike " to speak of . A tense conversation would then ensue where Lemon tried to explain how averages work , while Horowitz , not understanding , continued to argue that there was a spike in crime from 2006 to 2015. 
 <p> When President Donald Trump was so inspired by a Tucker Carlson segment on Fox News about crime in Sweden that he stood up at a Florida rally to discuss something that did n't happen , it was bound to be the sort of fodder late night comedians would find impossible to ignore . <p> At the tail 's end of his monologue Monday night , Stephen Colbert joined in on the chorus of mockery over the subject , using the opportunity to ding the Trump administration for a number of recent flaps regarding fake terror attacks . " Tragically , Sweden is the third attack that has not shocked the world in the last month . First there was n't the Bowling Green Massacre . Then , no one was lost in Atlanta . And now ... it 's not Sweden 's turn , " he said . <p> The Late Show host continued , " But that does n't mean we do n't stand in solidarity with everyone who did not suffer .

 <h> James O'Keefe Teases Release of #CNNLeaks Tomorrow <p> James O'Keefe , well-known for his undercover sting videos , has recently been hinting at the release of behind-the-scenes footage from one news organization in particular , and today he confirmed he was talking about CNN : <p> O'Keefe spoke to Sean Hannity on the radio this week and said that he will be releasing hundreds of hours of footage he obtained .

 <h> Rachel Dolezal Says She is Jobless and On the Verge of Being Homeless <p> Remember Rachel Dolezal ? You know , the white woman who pretended to be black while holding a leadership position with her local NAACP chapter before being exposed by a reporter ? Following that infamous encounter , Dolezal became a huge national story , eventually losing her university teaching position , NAACP post , community activist assignments , and newspaper column . <p> Well , she 's back in the spotlight .

People point at her and laugh . <p> Dolezal pointed out that she wrote a memoir , but it was rejected by 30 publishers before finally being picked up . She attributed this to what she felt was an overriding narrative about her . <p> " The narrative was that I 'd offended both communities in an unforgivable way , so anybody who gave me a dime would be contributing to wrong and oppression and bad things , " she explained .

 <h> Twitter Has a Lot of Feelings About Jackie Chan 's Presence at the Oscars <p> Jackie Chan is at the Oscars tonight , which may be due to the fact that he was given an honorary award in November for his " extraordinary achievements " in film over the years . He was shown on screen during Justin Timberlake 's performance of " Ca n't Stop the Feeling , " and people had a lot of feelings about it . Some were concerned about the fact that he was seated so far back . In reality , Chan is seated where he is because of his award . Others liked watching him clap . But pretty much everyone had something to say about it : 
 <p> At tonight 's Oscars , Jimmy Kimmel did a special edition of his popular " Celebrities Read Mean Tweets " segment with lots of actors in this year 's nominated movies . Highlights included , " Oh , look at me , I 'm Ryan Gosling . I have perfect bone structure and kind eyes . Go f*ck yourself , Ryan Gosling . " We also got to watch Samuel L. Jackson read aloud on T.V. that he has " resting fart face . " Emma Stone read that she " looks like a crack whore " in all of her roles . <p> Perhaps most importantly , we all finally realized that Eddie Redmayne and Felicity Jones have the exact same face . We could n't put our finger on it before . 
 <h> Virginia Waitress Accused of Faking Racist Message Left on Receipt <p> The lawyer for a Virginia cafe customer accused of leaving a racist note on a receipt in January has in turn accused the waitress making the complaint of faking the message . <p> Anita 's New Mexico Style Caf ? waitress Kelly images of the receipt . Scribbled at the bottom of the receipt was " Great service , do n't tip Black people . " The story went viral and led to widespread coverage from outlets like Huffington Post , BBC , the Associated Press , and Yahoo News . <p> Carter received nationwide support , including an online fundraising effort that netted her over $3,000 . But the lawyer for the customer now accuses her of making the whole thing up . <p> " Our client did not nor would he ever write anything about refusing to tip African Americans because of their race , " attorney Daniel WTOP . " Our client did not leave a $0.00 tip . Our client tipped $0.01 out of his own conviction against tipping well for poor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leave a note , reading , ' Terrible service . ' <p> The Daily Caller notes there are some clues on the receipt that could back up the customer 's story . The image of the receipt provided to reporters indicates that it 's a reprint of the original . The timestamp at the top also indicates it was printed after 1 AM , even though the incident reportedly took place during brunchtime . <p> For now , the local NAACP chapter is standing by Carter . But president Philip Thompson tells WTOP they are investigating the new allegations . " It 's sad any way it goes , " Thompson said . 
 <h> White House Grants Infowars Preview of Trump 's Congressional Address <p> Infowars released a preview of President Donald Trump 's Tuesday congressional address Monday , claiming that they received the information directly from the White House . <p> " Here 's a point-by-point preview of what the president will address during his speech tomorrow before a Joint Session of Congress , as relayed to Infowars ... " reads the piece , which lacks a byline . " It should be noted this was not a leak , but was given directly to Infowars . " <p> Despite their claim of an " exclusive , " conservative pundit Erick Erickson 's The Resurgent posted the same information shortly afterwards , saying it had been sent to a few outlets . " I was n't going to publish them , but as one site is claiming an exclusive and publishing them , I figured I would , " Erickson wrote . A correspondent for the right-of-center One America News also confirmed on Twitter that they had received the same email . 
 <h> A Louisville Student Made a Half-Court Short , But Was Robbed of $38K Prize on a Technicality <p> On Thursday , a University of Louisville student thought he 'd won $38,000 after making four shots during the halftime 's contest of a recent game including one from half-court . But the student is being denied the money on a technicality . <p> The student , Jackson Logsdon , made a layup , a free throw , a 3-pointer , and a half-court shot in less than 30 seconds . He was supposed to have won the money , but Logsdon was deemed ineligible to win the cash because he 'd played high school basketball in the past six years -- a violation of the rules set forth by Million Dollar Media who ran the contest . <p> " It is a huge bummer as I am an out-of-state student , " Logsdon said , according to Courier-Journal . " It would have went a long way to paying off student loans and anything in that manner . " <p> University spokesman Ira Green confirmed the news to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dollar Media , and unfortunately , the student did n't meet a couple of the stipulations , which are very specific . However , we are excited for him and are working on some items , so he does n't go away empty handed . " <p> Those items ? According to a report by WAVE-TV Louisville , the university is going to pay for both Logsdon 's books and meal plan . Depending on which meal plan is being covered , this may be at least somewhat of a good faith effort on the university 's part to compensate Logsdon . Meal plans range from 
 <p> Seated beneath a towering portrait of President George Washington in the White House , President Donald Trump spoke at length with Fox &amp; Friends for an exclusive interview that aired Tuesday morning . Early on in the hit , Brian Kilmeade gave the Commander in Chief the opportunity to display a bit of humility : By naming a time when he was deserving of criticism in the press . <p> As for getting an answer ? No such luck . <p> Kilmeade asked in the interview that aired Tuesday , " You have said , ' I can take hits when it 's justified . ' Can you give me an example of a time when somebody was critical of you and you 've thought , ' I deserved that hit . I deserved that column . I deserved that ' ? " <p> Trump loosely considered the question for a moment , then quickly said , " No , probably not . I could never do that probably , " he said to laughs from the Fox &amp; Friends trio . " I 'm not gon na give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> Kilmeade continued , " Do you ever think to yourself , ' Wow I screwed that up . Wow I kind of deserved that hit ' ? " <p> " Yeah , yeah sure , " Trump admitted sheepishly , " and you know what , honestly , if I do that , and that does happen , and if I take a hit , I wo n't give you any additional ammunition but over the years you make a mistake . I fully understand when they hit you . " The President then invoked the possibility of fake sources and fake news that cloud negative headlines , absolving himself of some responsibility regarding the stories that drive bad headlines . <p> Watch above via Fox News . image via screengrab <p> -- J.D.

 <p> Following President Donald Trump 's address to the joint session of Congress tonight , CNN political commentator Van Jones pointed out that there was one " extraordinary " moment that sealed Trump as the President of the United States . " <p> " He became President of the United States in that moment , " Jones said . " Period . " <p> He continued , " There are a lot of people who have a lot of reason to be frustrated with him , fearful of him , mad at him . But that was one of the most extraordinary moments you have ever seen in American politics period . " <p> The one-time Obama adviser noted that those hoping that Trump could become unifying should be happy with that moment . However , for those hoping he 'd " remain a divisive cartoon , " Jones warned them that " they should be a little worried tonight . " 
 <h> Amazon Admits a Typo Shut Down Much of the Internet on Tuesday <p> You may have noticed that on Tuesday , a lot of the Internet was acting up . Tons of websites were down . Maybe you would come across a website that worked , but some of the embedded content would n't load . Or your interoffice chat system was n't quite working properly . The overarching reason was known immediately : S3 , Amazon 's hosting platform as part of its Amazon Web Services suite of cloud computing tools , saw a number of servers go down . Since S3 is relied upon by much of the Internet and suppose to be nearly unsinkable , this was a very bad thing . On Thursday , once everything was restored , Amazon put up a post on the AWS website explaining what happened : A typo wreaked all of Tuesday 's havoc . <p> Yes , really . <p> " We 'd like to give you some additional information about the service disruption that occurred in the Northern Virginia ( US-EAST-1 ) Region on the morning of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to fix an issue with their billing system , " an authorized S3 team member using an established playbook executed a command which was intended to remove a small number of servers for one of the S3 subsystems that is used by the S3 billing process . " There was just one problem with this : " Unfortunately , one of the inputs to the command was entered incorrectly and a larger set of servers was removed than intended . The servers that were inadvertently removed supported two other S3 subsystems . One of these subsystems , the index subsystem , manages the metadata and location information of all S3 objects in the region . " <p> Well , that answers that . The post closed with an apology : <p> Finally , we want to apologize for the impact this event caused for our customers . While we are proud of our long track record of availability with Amazon S3 , we know how critical this service is to our customers , their applications and end users , and their businesses . We will do everything we can to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ availability even further . <p> If there 's a moral to this story , it 's probably that even the best and most reliable can screw up in epic fashion . 
 <p> Earlier this week , we posted about former major league pitcher and current Breitbart radio show host Curt into it on Twitter with former democratic Senate candidate Jason Kander . <p> On Wednesday , Schilling once again mixed it up with a well-known person on social media . This time , it was Rosie O'Donnell . <p> The brief skirmish started after a follower Tweeted Schilling a video of O'Donnell speaking Tuesday at a protest before President Donald Trump 's joint session of Congress on Tuesday night . Schilling criticized O'Donnell 's speech . <p> They believe if they say impeachment and treason enough it will be true . The method of stopping ISIS ! 
 <h> Jimmy Kimmel Talks Trump With George W. Bush : ' Were You Jealous of the Size of the Crowds at Trump 's Inauguration ? ' <p> Fresh off his ( almost ) completely successful stint as host of the 89th Academy Awards , Jimmy Kimmel landed a big interview on his own late night show , former President George W. Bush . <p> Sitting down with the comedian for a chummy 20-minute talk , the former president waxed about his own time in office , his second career as a painter , and UFOs . When it came to the orange-faced elephant in the room , Bush did n't take the bait . <p> " Were you jealous of the size of the crowds at Trump 's inauguration ? " said Kimmel , sparking a round of laughter from the former president . Kimmel then got personal , asking whether the attacks on Jeb Bush during the primary had left bad blood . Bush was deft . <p> " I 've been in a number of campaigns , " he said " I 'm pretty well used to all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of course , no stranger to the bare-knuckled politics that felled his brother in the 2016 campaign . During his own primary against Arizona Senator John McCain in 2000 , George W. Bush operatives famously spread rumors that , Bridget McCain , the Senator 's adopted daughter from Bangladesh , was in fact an illegitimate child and that his wife Cindy was a drug addict . 
 <p> So , where did Trump get this information or what inspired this series of tweets ? Well , it seems that a Breitbart article published yesterday by Joel Pollak might be the genesis . Pollak 's piece highlighted a Mark Levin radio segment in which he outlined his belief that Obama had used " police state " tactics against Trump . Part of that included FISA requests submitted by the Obama administration to monitor communications . <p> Per the Washington Post , the Breitbart story " has been circulating among Trump 's senior staff , according to a White House official who described it as a useful catalogue of the Obama administration 's activities . " 
 <p> During today 's broadcast of Fox News Sunday , host Chris Wallace pressed Sen. Chris Coons ( D-DE ) over comments he made in an MSNBC interview last week where he indicated that the intelligence community had transcripts of conversations between Russia and the Donald Trump campaign . <p> Playing a clip of Coons telling Andrea Mitchell that " there are transcripts that provide very helpful , very critical insights " and that he believes " they exist , " Wallace wondered aloud if this hearkened back to a darker time . <p> " Senator , we 're talking here about the President of the United States , " Wallace said . " Is n't there more than a whiff of McCarthyism for you as a U.S. Senator to say there are transcripts out there that provide insight into whether or not there was collusion , but you do n't know whether or not they exist ? " <p> Coons answered that he was trying to encourage the intelligence community to give raw data to the congressional committees , which he says he 's now been told will happen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perhaps leading to a hyperventilation in the Senate . <p> Wallace also grilled Coons over whether he knew of any hard evidence that there was collusion between the Russians and Trump campaign that went beyond suspicion , to which Coons acknowledged he did n't have that rock-hard proof . The Fox News host then wanted to know if this was all just a way to prevent the Trump administration of getting their agenda moving . 
 <p> Tonight on CNN , Pamela Brown asked former FBI Assistant Director Tom Fuentes what he made of current FBI director James the bureau to reject Donald Trump 's claims that former President Barack Obama wiretapped him . <p> " I think it 's very significant . I 've never heard of a situation similar to this ever , the former official . " In 30 years in the FBI , and dealing with the FBI in the eight years since retirement , I 've not heard of a similar situation . " <p> Watch above to see what he says this situation has in common with Comey 's handling of Hillary Clinton 's email scandal . 
 <p> With anchor Wolf Blitzer noting the new travel ban now has a 120-day freeze on Syrian refugees , rather than an indefinite suspension as in the original one , Damon explained that it might give Syrians a " little bit of hope " only because the population is " desperate for anything . " <p> However , she also pointed out that even though Syrian refugees are n't indefinitely banned , there are no guarantees that they 'd be allowed entry after 120 days is up . " That is psychologically crushing on an individual and populations who frankly have been through much more than many of us have ever been through , " Damon stated . <p> Moving on to the six countries that are impacted by the ban Iraq has now been removed she told Blitzer that " it does n't make sense to anyone " because those nationals will say they " never did anything to America " and were n't responsible for 9/11 . <p> " The damage this does to how Muslims in the Middle East perceive America is very difficult to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they view US policies still wanted to believe in this concept of the American dream , " she added , providing her opinion . " Now with this , even that is being taken away from them . " 
 <h> WATCH : The Spirit of Hillary Clinton Is Practically Looming Over Trump in the White House <p> This morning , Donald Trump gave a tour of the White House to some eager reporters and guests . That 's not important right now , though . What is important is the moment he walks under the portrait of former First Lady Hillary Clinton . <p> Trump just ca n't escape that so-called nasty woman ( and to be honest , she just ca n't escape Trump and his administration ) . <p> So , let 's take some bets . Is this image going to upset Trump like photos of him from certain angles reportedly do ? If he does get upset , who will shoulder the blame ? White House staff ? The crooked media ? 
 <p> During an appearance on CNN this morning , a Republican Congressman admonished the comments made by one of his GOP colleagues earlier today regarding how Americans may need to make choices on spending their money when it comes to healthcare . <p> As you may recall , Rep. Jason Chaffetz ( R-UT ) showed up on CNN 's New Dayto defend the new GOP replacement for Obamacare and stated that " Americans have choices and they 've got to make a choice and so maybe rather than getting that new iPhone that they just love and they want to go spend hundreds of dollars on that , maybe they should invest it in their own healthcare . " He also agreed that low-income Americans will need to make sacrifices because they " have to lower the cost of healthcare . " <p> Hours later , CNN anchor John Berman asked Rep. Larry Bucshon ( R-IN ) if his thoughts on Chaffetz 's comments and if he believed " it 's a choice between iPhones and coverage . " <p> " Absolutely not , " Bucshon stated . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I think , are unwarranted at this time . And so you know , we want to make sure everyone has access to quality , affordable healthcare . " <p> The Indiana lawmaker continued , " We do n't want to make people to make choices in their life . Having to choose healthcare and leaving out other parts of their life that everyone else enjoys . So I do n't think that 's true . I think that this is not going to do that . " <p> Bucshon would go on to discuss his thoughts on the GOP plan and how he believes it will get costs down and provide widespread coverage . 
 <p> WikiLeaks released thousands of documents on Tuesday , claiming that they hold significant details about the CIA and their capabilities for hacking and cyber-espionage . <p> While the CIA has not yet publicly commented on the authenticity of the leaks , the documents contain information about various infiltration codes , cyberwarfare strategies , and the ability to turn phones and TVs into recording devices . Wikileaks said , in a press release , that they obtained this information from an " isolated , high-security network " at the CIA 's Center for Cyber Intelligence , and the documents appear online as Vault 7 Part 1 of WikiLeaks ' " Year Zero " series . <p> The CIA had created , in effect , its ' own NSA ' with even less accountability and without publicly answering the question as to whether such a massive budgetary spend on duplicating the capacities of a rival agency could be justified ... The source wishes to initiate a public debate about the security , creation , use , proliferation and democratic control of cyberweapons . <p> WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange also gave a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Year Zero " will spark a new conversation on the " extreme proliferation risk " of online warfare . WikiLeaks says that they redacted certain bits of sensitive information , though they did reveal , among other things , that the U.S. Consulate in Frankfurt is a base for CIA agents to go undercover in Germany . 
 <p> Rex Tillerson is heading to Asia in his capacity as Secretary of State and foreign policy experts are warning that much depends on his trip going really , really well . Some describe the results of a bad trip as " catastrophic , " considering the precarious position the region is in thanks to North Korea 's increasing provocations . <p> That 's an occasion that requires a reliable liaison to the American people , right ? If it could be " catastrophic " for the trip to go badly -- and even if it could n't -- the people in our democracy should be able to know every detail thanks to the free press . That 's what CNN 's Jake Tapper thinks . <p> Too bad it 's not going to happen . <p> Not bringing press on a trip like that is unusual &amp; insulting to any American who is looking for anything but a state-run version of events

 <h> Pence on New Flynn Revelations : ' Affirmation ' of Trump 's Decision to Ask for Resignation <p> Fox News ' Bret Baier tonight asked Vice President Mike Pence for his reaction to the revelation that former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn received over half a million dollars for consulting work that may have benefited the Turkish government . <p> Baier brought up Flynn filing with the DOJ this week as a foreign agent and asked if that means the White House " would have had to fire him anyway . " Even if he had n't lied about the nature of his call with the Russian ambassador . <p> Pence said he only heard about this today and the news about Flynn is an " affirmation of the president 's decision to ask General Flynn to resign . " <p> Sean Spicersaid today , when asked about whether the White House knew about this , " I do n't believe that that was known . "

 <p> On New Day Friday , co-host Chris Cuomo mixed it up in a feisty exchange with GOP Congressman Jim Jordan . The two men dove into the details of the American Health Care Act and how the future of health care in the United States should look . <p> " We want to make this bill consistent with what we told the voters we were going to do , " said Jordan , who has criticized the GOP 's Obamacare replacement from the right . Jordan cited a previous repeal attempt as the model he wished to emulate . " The exact same legislation we put on President Obama 's desk , let 's put on President Trump 's desk . We know we can pass that . " <p> Cuomo then dug into the details with the prosecutorial flair that has become his trademark . " Health care costs are going up . That was true before Obamacare that was true after Obamacare , but it was less true after Obamacare , " he said . " Is it misleading to say to people Obamacare is the problem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marketplace , not more government control , " said Jordan . <p> Cuomo then accused him and Republicans of " cherry picking " data to support their conclusions . " You use government as if it 's a bad word in this context , but to be fair , there is no place that you 'll find that has this kind of marketplace when it comes to health insurance , " said Cuomo . " You 're saying it like it 's something that should be understood . It 's never existed anywhere else that you can point to and remember you have to be ok with having less people having health insurance to get some people to have it cheaper . " <p> " The way you 're fixing it now , millions of people may lose their coverage , you need to own that , " said Cuomo . <p> Jordan stuck to script , " It works in every other industry , " he said , stammering at various points . 
 <h> Security Yells at Reporters to Clear Out of Room After They Ask Trump About Wiretaps and Flynn <p> Since President Donald to Twitter this past weekend to offer up unproven claims that his predecessor had wiretapped his phones in Trump Tower prior to the election , his public appearances have been noticeably sparse . For the most part , he 's only been seen giving prepared remarks in scheduled meetings with lawmakers or business leaders , with the press not given the opportunity to ask him questions . <p> Today offered up another such instance , when the media was briefly allowed into the president 's meeting with House Republicans , where he spoke from a script for a couple of minutes , highlighting that he supported the House GOP 's Obamacare replacement bill while railing against the Affordable Care Act . <p> Well , it appears that one correspondent attempted to get answers from Trump on his wiretap assertion : <p> I asked the President three times " Any proof on the wiretapping ? " He did n't answer ; the press pool then escorted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reporter tried to get Trump to answer if he knew former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn acting as a foreign agent during the campaign and transition . ( The White House has said Trump did not know . ) <p> This led to Trump 's personal security to loudly clear out the room : <p> Pool : One of Trump 's " personal security men " yelled " loudly " at reporters to leave as they peppered Trump w/questions on wiretapping &amp; Flynn **26;914;TOOLONG 
 <p> During today 's White House press briefing , White House press secretary Sean Spicer lashed out when a series of reporters confronted him over reports surrounding former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn and his recent retroactive registration as a foreign agent . <p> Addressing the recent Associated Press report stating that Donald Trump 's presidential transition team was made aware that Flynn needed to register as a foreign agent due to his lobbying work with Turkey , Spicer thought that was revolving around private matters and that it was n't up for the government to work on . <p> This led to Fox News John Roberts aggressively pushing back on Spicer , asking the press sec how this did n't raise any red flags . <p> " It 's not a question raising red flags , " Spicer exclaimed . " It 's the question of whether they gave them advice they were supposed to , it 's not up to them what you need to do or not do . " <p> He then moved on to the New York Thrush , who piggybacked on Roberts ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ letter about Flynn 's dealings with Turkey and wanted to know if this was a question of judgment . <p> " You 're asking me forget about the legalisms , " Spicer stated . " That 's what we ask people to do is follow the law . You ca n't forget about the legalism . That 's what we did . " He also took issue with Thrush asking about Flynn 's dealings , feeling he was impugning the general 's character . <p> He was also pressed on if there may be other concerns of staffers and administration officials regarding their backgrounds . 
 <p> Conservative firebrand Tomi Lahren ripped into Samantha Bee on Friday night , all while bemoaning the double standard when it comes to liberals and conservatives criticizing bad behavior . <p> Lahren faced off with Democratic strategist Jessica Tarlov to discuss how Bee mocked Kyle Coddington , a cancer patient at CPAC , by making a joke about his " Nazi hair . " Bee has apologized over the incident , though Lahren opined that the outrage of Bee 's misfired joke would 've been much worse if Bee was a conservative media personality instead of a liberal . <p> " Do you think if this was a conservative host , even a conservative media host , do you think the left would 've called for them to step down or resign ? " Lahren asked . <p> Tarlov argued that left-leaning audiences have made those calls towards Alex Jones and other right-wing personalities for their objectionable comments in the past . Lahren responded that the " hypocrisy of the left " is that many liberals got outraged by Tarlov 's conservative examples , but they do n't show that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Coddington has spoken out about the incident , saying that Bee 's take-back was a " half-apology " and that her Full Frontal segment was " inconsiderate and very unprofessional.

 <p> Kellyanne Conway went on the Monday morning news junket today and she may or may not have admitted that the Trump administration has no proof to back up the president 's allegation that Trump Tower was wiretapped by former president Barack Obama . <p> During an interview earlier today , Conway stood by President Trump 's claim saying it 's " just a fact of modern life " that microwaves and other tech can be hacked and turned into surveillance devices . George Stephanopoulos asked Conway about this on Good Morning America , inquiring as to why Trump made the claim without offering any proof . <p> Conway insisted that her previous comments were n't about Trump Tower specifically , but were about the various CIA spying techniques recently disclosed by WikiLeaks . Stephanopoulos asked Conway to clarify that she has no evidence about Trump Tower , and she responded with " Of course I do n't have any evidence for those allegations , and that answer has nothing to do with what the president said last week .

 <p> The Chairman of Tesco 's board has come under fire after he made the claim that white men are " endangered species " in boardrooms . According to a report from The Guardian , chairman John Allan was at a retail conference and in a session of aspiring non-executive directors where he said that if you are " female and from an ethnic background , and preferably both , then you are in an extremely propitious period . " <p> He then reportedly elaborated , saying , " For a thousand years , men have got most of these jobs , the pendulum has swung very significantly the other way now and will do for the foreseeable future , I think . If you are a white male , tough . You are an endangered species and you are going to have to work twice as hard . " <p> You can imagine how this was received . The Guardian says a lot of people are calling for a boycott of the chain . Twitter users are also taking issue with Allan 's comments , and many have pointed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men : 
 <h> Hollywood Conservatives on the Down-Low in Age of Trump <p> David Ng of The Los Angeles Times spotlighted how " the political closet is now a necessity for many " Hollywood conservatives in the wake of the election of President Donald Trump . <p> Ng led his Saturday feature with the testimony of Schindler 's List producer Gerald Molen , who underlined that the " acrimony " towards Republicans in the entertainment industry is " front and center . " <p> The journalist underlined that " since the presidential election , some conservatives feel that their political beliefs are more of a career liability than ever -- even for those traditional Republicans disenchanted by President Trump . " He cited the recent experience of writer Andrew Klavan , who disclosed that producers " called my agent asking , ' Why would you represent this guy ? ' Anything that lowers your odds is going to hurt . " <p> Ng later zeroed in on how , just like in the broader ideological movement , " Hollywood conservatives are ... a divided group when it comes to Trump , whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alienated many Republicans . " <p> ' There are very conservative people in FOA Friends of Abe , an organization of entertainment industry conservatives who are troubled by his rhetoric , ' said executive director Jeremy Boreing , a filmmaker and self-described Trump skeptic . ' There are others who are very gung-ho and supportive of him . There are people who are cautiously optimistic and others who are just cautious ' <p> Boreing also asserted that " Hollywood was a more pleasant place for conservatives during Obama 's tenure because Hollywood was in a good mood . " <p> , Klavan , and Boering are n't the first Hollywood conservatives to go on the record about the hostile climate in the entertainment industry after Election Day . Shortly before Inauguration Day , Ben liberals of " trying to shut down free debate in Hollywood . " <p> The Times writer later quoted from a " prominent TV and movie actor who requested his name not be used for fear of professional repercussions , " who denounced the " McCarthyism coming from the left " in Hollywood . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have erupted on the set of one of his shows and that a conservative producer he works with has been shunned by colleagues . " <p> The same actor doubled-down on his attack on the Hollywood left : " If you are even lukewarm to Republicans , you are excommunicated from the church of tolerance . " 
 <p> Tucker Carlson made it clear on Fox News last night that in his mind , NBC News and MSNBC do n't have a leg to stand on when they report on Russia 's possible meddling in the 2016 election . <p> He brought up the " grab ' em by the pussy " audio that came from the set of an old NBC show , then reappeared in the Washington Post years later , just as the man making the lewd comments in the recording , Donald Trump , was running for President . Carlson contended that NBC lied by not outwardly admitting they leaked that audio to WaPo . <p> " If you are a news organization and someone stole a video out of your office , would you not want to know about this ? " he wondered before saying he was sure NBC already knew the identity of the leaker . <p> This lambasting was done at the same time as Rachel Maddow 's epic and infuriating bait-and-switch on MSNBC regarding Trump 's tax releases last night . Both Carlson and Maddow occupy the 9:00 p.m. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been dominating it for the last week . <p> " What do you think played a bigger role in the election , the Access Hollywood tape or the Russian government ? " Carlson asked . " NBC lied to the public to destroy a politician they did not like . We know that . We know the would not do it again , what would they ? " <p> Trump himself , at least , is publicly claiming that he does n't believe the tax returns Maddow got ahold of via a reporter who was given them anonymously were acquired ethically. 
 <p> Ahead of the airing pf President Donald Trump 's first interview since making his explosive claims via Twitter that former President Barack Trump Tower 's phones prior to the election , Fox News released a couple of excerpts to the press . <p> Trump was also asked about the wiretap claims , and he gave a somewhat cryptic answer in response . <p> " But wiretap covers a lot of different things , " the president said . " I think you 're going to find some very interesting items coming to the forefront over the next two weeks . " <p> Earlier today , the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee came out and said there was no evidence that Obama had wiretapped Trump Tower . The Department of Justice has asked for additional time to provide Congress with any potential proof on Trump 's assertion . 
 <p> Despite several teams having a severe need at the quarterback position , free agent signal caller Colin Kaepernick has drawn minimal interest as he searches for a new team . And according to a new report , the reason might be that more than two-thirds of NFL team executives " genuinely hate " him . <p> Bleacher Report spoke to an anonymous AFC general manager , who said that Kaepernick alienated many in NFL front offices by protesting the National Anthem during the 2016 season . <p> According to the unnamed GM , approximately 70 percent of teams , " genuinely hate him and ca n't stand what he did . They want nothing to do with him . They wo n't move on . They think showing no interest is a form of punishment . " <p> As for the rest of the league , the GM says that some teams believe Kaepernick ca n't play the position well anymore , while the rest fear possible backlash from fans and even President Donald Trump . <p> " I think some teams also want to use Kaepernick as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing what he did , " the GM added . 
 <p> A report from The New York Times tonight says that one of the sources Fox 's Judge Andrew Napolitano cited for his claim of GCHQ surveillance of Trump that sparked a national incident this week came from someone who once pushed a Michelle Obama hoax . <p> Larry Johnson , who was himself once a Fox News contributor , said in a telephone interview that Mr. Napolitano called him on Friday and requested that he speak to The New York Times . Mr. Johnson said he was one of the sources for Mr. Napolitano 's claim about British intelligence . <p> Mr. Johnson became infamous in political circles after he spread false rumors in 2008 that Michelle Obama had been videotaped using a slur against Caucasians . In the interview on Friday , Mr. Johnson acknowledged his notoriety , but said that his knowledge of surveillance of Mr. Trump came from sources in the American intelligence community . Mr. Napolitano , he said , heard about his information through an intermediary . <p> " It sounds like a Frederick Forsythe novel , " Mr. Johnson said . <p> ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whitey . " You may remember this hoax from the brief bit of attention it got during the ' 08 campaign. ) 
 <h> California Waiter Fired From Restaurant After Allegedly Asking Diners for ' Proof of Residency ' <p> A restaurant in Huntington Beach , CA has been attracting online interest after a worker there was recently let go for supposedly asking patrons for " proof of residency " before letting them place orders . <p> Diana Carrillo went for a night out at the Saint Marc Pub-Cafe a week ago , where she and her companions ordered drinks after sitting down . According to statement she posted on Facebook , Carrillo 's party was shocked when the waiter asked them to prove that they were U.S. citizens : <p> Carrillo and her party left the restaurant after confronting a manager about the exchange , and she posted her anger about the employee 's " discriminatory actions . " The waiter for Carrillo 's table was fired , and the restaurant has offered an apologetic statement picked up by Fox 11 . <p> This very unfortunate incident has been handled internally through the termination of the employee at fault . We also contacted the guest and plan to donate 10 percent of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Orange County Immigrant Youth United . In no way are the actions of this former employee representative of the Saint Marc brand nor are they reflective of the opinions of anyone else on our team , including executive management . We have always celebrated being part of the diverse Huntington Beach community , which means valuing all guests and treating every individual with respect . <p> Kent Berden , the restaurant 's senior director , said the waiter told him that he asked the question " in a joking fashion . " Even so , OC Register reports that Berden said the waiter 's actions were not in line with the restaurant 's code of conduct . 
 <h> WATCH : Alec Baldwin Teaches a Kid the Art of the Trump Impression <p> At the premiere of his movie Boss Baby , Alec Baldwin helped a young fan master his Donald Trump impersonation . <p> Given that the President has made it very clear he hates Baldwin 's Saturday Night Live impressions , he likely wo n't be happy to learn that a kid has been sent out into the world with instructions to make sure he lowers his jaw the appropriate amount when imitating the Commander in Chief . <p> Maybe if the boy practices hard enough , he can one day be indistinguishable from Trump , just like Baldwin . 
 <h> WATCH : This Wheel of Fortune Fail is One For the Books <p> The syndicated version of Wheel of Fortune has been on the air since 1983 . And in all that time , it 's likely that there have been very few blunders on par with the flub committed on Tuesday night 's episode . <p> A contestant named Kevin looked very much on his way to solving a puzzle early on in the show . Let 's see what he had left . <p> Yup , that was it . <p> Kevin decided to give the wheel one more spin . After landing on $600 , Kevin called out his letter . <p> " K. " <p> The audience groaned . Host Pat Sajak let the failure awkwardly hang in the air for a second before saying , simply , " No . " <p> A Streetcar Naked Desire ? <p> The next contestant picked the final letter and correctly called out the name of the classic Tennessee Williams play " A Streetcar Named Desire . " 
 <p> LaVar Ball , the father of star UCLA freshman Lonzo Ball , has gotten attention over the past few months for a number of outlandish claims he 's made . ( Most notably , the claim that he could 've Jordan in one-on-one . ) But this time , he may have picked on the wrong person or , more specifically , the wrong person 's son . <p> During an interview on the In the Zone podcast with Fox Sports host Chris Broussard , Ball spoke about why it might be difficult for LeBron James 's children to live up to the public 's expectations in basketball because of their father 's greatness . <p> You got LeBron , it 's going to be hard for his kids because they are going to look at them like , ' You got to be just like your dad . ' And after a while , that pressure starts sitting on you like , ' Why do I got to be just like him ? What ca n't I just be me ? ' And then they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soft , you 're not that good . ' Because the expectation is very , very high . <p> ESPN reports that 12-year-old LeBron James Jr . already has standing verbal scholarship offers from basketball powerhouses Duke and Kentucky . LeBron Sr. , undoubtedly , is looking to protect his son from comments such as LaVar Ball 's as he goes forward with his promising basketball endeavors. 
 <p> In the pages of The Washington Post , Huckabee issued an impassioned plea directly to Trump on behalf of the National Endowment for the Arts , saying the program was essential to avoid " killing the hope and help that come from creativity . " <p> Huckabee argued that the real recipients of NEA funding were not glitzy Hollywood celebrities but mostly impoverished children . <p> I do care greatly about the real recipients of endowment funds : the kids in poverty for whom NEA programs may be their only chance to learn to play an instrument , test-drive their God-given creativity and develop a passion for those things that civilize and humanize us all . They 're the reason we should stop and recognize that this line item accounting for just 0.004 percent of the federal budget is not what 's breaking the bank . <p> In addition to the talk of " God-given creativity , ' Huckabee made what he said was a conservative case for the program , arguing that studies were more than conclusive showing that every penny put into the program delivered many more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leads to higher grade-point averages and SAT scores , as well as improvements in math skills and spatial reasoning . Do we want students who are less likely to drop out of school and more likely to have academic success , particularly in math and science ? Music and art deliver , especially for students likely to get lost in an education assembly line that can be more Pink Floyd 's " Another Brick in the Wall " than about creative thinking and problem solving . Creativity finds cures for diseases , creates companies such as Apple and Microsoft and , above all , makes our culture more livable . <p> The issue is a personal one for Huckabee , who reminded readers in his byline that he was also an " amateur musician . " <p> In addition to the NEA , Trump 's budget has come under fire across the political spectrum for its drastic cuts across the federal budget . Many Republican governors have balked at cuts to less well-known programs ( like the Appalachian Regional Commission ) that stimulate economic growth in areas that went heavily for Trump in 2016. 
 <p> It is always unusual when senior federal officials weigh in on local elections , but Energy Secretary Rick Perry may have set a new bar for bizarre by blasting the results of a recent student body election at his Alma mater , Texas A&amp;M University . <p> Perry , who is also a former governor of the state , took to the pages of the Houston Chronicle to slam the election of Bobby Brooks . The Junior from Belton , Texas made history by becoming the first openly gay person to lead the student body . <p> Brooks finished second to Robert McIntosh , the son of GOP fundraiser Alison McIntosh , but was named the winner after McIntosh was disqualified for violating school election rules . <p> It did n't sit well with Perry , who said awarding the election to Brooks smacked of " diversity " politics . <p> Now , Brooks ' presidency is being treated as a victory for " diversity . " It is difficult to escape the perception that this quest for " diversity " is the real reason the election outcome was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school politics offering a point by point rebuttal of why he felt McIntosh has been treated unfairly . <p> As Energy Secretary , Perry also oversees a vast federal bureaucracy with a multibillion dollar budget . 
 <p> Bill Maher faced off with American Conservative Union chairman Matt Schlapp tonight over President Trump . Throughout the interview , Maher tried to get Schlapp to acknowledge serious problems of Trump 's , particularly on the issue of falsehoods . <p> He brought up Trump 's claims of voter fraud and wiretapping and asked , " Is n't that a different level of lying ? " <p> He tried to get Schlapp to acknowledge that Trump is more of a narcissist than most other politicians . <p> Maher also brought up the president 's claim today that he never said Obamacare would be repealed and replaced in 64 days ( when , in fact , he repeatedly said it would be done immediately ) . He asked Schlapp , " How is that not a lie ? " <p> Schlapp said that HHS Secretary Tom Price " can make big changes to the health care system " and that Trump did n't mean the bill would get passed and be implemented right away . <p> Maher also asked him if it would be treasonous if there was collusion with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " but Maher shot back that if this was Hillary Clinton they were talking about , there would be no " probably " there . 
 <p> A highly-partisan cable news host from a network known for its lack of objectivity on President Donald Trump is teasing major revelations regarding him . Only this time it is n't Rachel Maddow on MSNBC , but instead Judge Jeanine Pirro on Fox News Channel . <p> However , now there is an added dimension . The hype machine for what will surely , once again , be a big nothing-burger was ignited by the president himself in this tweet : <p> Let 's ponder just the tweet for a moment . In any other administration in United States history , this would be scandalous on its own . The President of the United States does not ( until now ) do commercials for weekend cable news television shows ! Especially those hosted by people who are not credible ! <p> However , since Trump has dramatically desensitized all of us to what should be absolutely outrageous , I 'm pretty sure that this previously unthinkable act of brazen commercialism on the part of the president did n't even raise many eyebrows . It is a psychological phenomenon that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most permanently destructive elements of his ascendency . <p> As for why Trump pimped out Pirro 's show tonight , the assumption is that she will have some " stunning " details related to Trump 's absurd " wiretapping " claims from a couple of weeks ago . Much like with Maddow and her big " Trump Taxes " scoop which turned out to be a big bust , it is very obvious that whatever Pirro may have is most likely totally irrelevant , at best . <p> I feel confident about this for a variety of reasons . First , Pirro is about the only Fox News host who could give Sean Hannity a run for his money when it comes to their willingness to do or say anything to please King Trump , and thus she has zero believability . Second , if whatever she thinks she has was a legitimate news story , it would not have been given to her , but to Bret Baier or Chris Wallace . Third , we already know that numerous Republicans have shot down Trump 's " wiretapping " claim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this week in the most high-profile manner possible . <p> It seems possible/likely that what Pirro will " reveal " is related to the highly questionable , contradictory , bizarre , and possibly illegal claims made this week by GOP House Intelligence Chairman Devin Nunes . Trump himself called them , inaccurately , a partial vindication of his original ludicrous " wiretapping " assertion . It would certainly fit that Trump wants the members of his cult to watch the only major outlet likely to give this story legitimacy . <p> So what will likely happen here is that Pirro will give her ( thanks to Trump , larger than normal ) segment of the Trump cult something that sounds like " news " and appears to be relevant to the president 's discredited allegations , but which really is n't at all . And that 's assuming what she offers up is n't just a pile of horse crap to begin with . <p> Of course , none of that really matters . Everyone will " win . " Pirro will get a big audience , the Trump cult @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to them in the midst of a temper tantrum provoked by bad news on the Russia front , and Trump will get to feel good about his Saturday night television viewing while still smarting from his colossal defeat on healthcare . When does all the real " winning " begin ? ! <p> The only losers here will be journalism , ethics , and the truth , but none of those things matter anymore anyway . 
 <p> New reports suggest that White House strategic advisor Steve Bannon is telling Donald Trump to take names for everyone who stopped the president from replacing the Affordable Care Act yesterday . <p> The American Health Care Act ( ACHA ) was abandoned on Friday , shortly after House Speaker Paul Ryan told Trump that the bill was opposed by too many skeptical conservatives who promised not to vote for it . According to The Daily Beast , journalists spoke to White House officials yesterday , and they were reportedly told that Bannon wants Trump to make sure he never forgets the ones who sunk the new legislation . <p> " Bannon has told the president to keep a shit list on this , " one official reportedly said . " He wants a running tally of Republicans who want to sink this ... Not sure if I 'd call it an ' enemies list , ' per se , but I would n't want to be on it . " <p> The indication from White House officials is that Bannon and Trump are taking notice of Congressional figures who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rumored list idea came a day after Trump held a meeting with the House Freedom Caucus in a failed attempt to garner enough support to ensure ACHA 's success . 
 <p> You may have already heard about the back-and-forth between Ted Koppel and Sean Hannity on CBS Sunday Morning today discussing the issue of America 's vast political divide . Koppel told Hannity that he thinks he 's bad for America because he 's " attracted people who are determined that ideology is more important than facts . " <p> Of course CBS edited down the lengthy interview for the broadcast , but Hannity 's interview ends with Koppel making this remark and does not include Hannity 's rebuttal . <p> So Hannity took to Twitter to slam the " fake ' edited ' news , " saying he talked a lot about liberal media bias . He called on CBS to release the full interview : <p> Fake " edited " news . I did about a 45 minute interview with CBS . They ran less than 2 . Why did Ted cut out my many examples of media bias ? https : 
 <h> Tomi Lahren Fighting for Control of Facebook Page in Severance Deal <p> Breakout conservative media star Tomi Lahren has amassed a huge following on social media . On Facebook , alone , she has over four million followers . Now , with Lahren in the process of exiting TheBlaze , that Facebook page has become a bone of contention . According to TMZ , Lahren is fighting with Blaze management for control of the account , ideally as part of her severance package . <p> According to TMZ , Lahren , who disappeared from TheBlaze after talking about being pro-choice on ABC 's " The View , " feels that " she 's more marketable if she brings her Facebook followers to her next gig . " A resolution to the severance issue is expected by the end of the week . If the report is correct , the two biggest bargaining chips are the reigns to the Facebook page and how long Lahren would have to sit out from work elsewhere . 
 <p> Sean Hannity tonight addressed President Trump 's tweets slamming the House Freedom Caucus , saying that picking this fight is inadvisable at a time when GOP unity should be the primary concern . <p> , in 2018 ! " <p> Hannity argued the Freedom Caucus is not to blame here , saying that the bill was " flawed from the beginning . " He said while he does n't know who in the White House is pushing this line against the caucus , he feels it to be " misplaced " because they want a win on this too . <p> He concluded his monologue by saying that right now the focus needs to be on House leadership bringing together every single faction of the party in the name of unity and finding a consensus on repealing and replacing Obamacare . <p> Hannity also spoke with former Speaker Newt Gingrich and asked him if Trump @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ care process . He argued , " They did n't do their job on the legislative side . " <p> Gingrich agreed that it was a " congressional failure , not a presidential failure . " <p> At one point he said " the establishment is working overtime to drive a wedge " between Trump and the Freedom Caucus in an attempt to push the president " towards the center . " 
 <p> As Morning Joe discussed reports of ongoing shakeups inside of the White House on Friday , Joe Scarborough took the opportunity to again blast President Trump 's Chief Strategist Steve Bannon , blaming him for the turmoil . As the panel talked about how Bannon reportedly tried to intimidate the House Freedom Caucus during a recent meeting , Mika Brzezinski snarked that maybe Bannon should 've " cleaned out another bathtub with acid . " <p> Brzezinski was referencing a profile of Bannon from earlier this month in TheWashington Post , which examined the curious aspects of the former Brietbart chief 's nomadic lifestyle . One detail that got a lot of attention was an anecdote about a landlord who found Bannon 's former home left in disrepair and a jacuzzi destroyed after it was seemingly covered in acid . <p> Brzezinski and Scarborough tried to change the subject to a Wall Street report from Sara Eisen , but they could n't stop talking about acid baths and the ruined jacuzzi . Even after Eisen gave her report , Scarborough kept things going by polling today 's panel to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The Morning Joe hosts ended up talking about the report multiple times throughout the last 15 minutes of the show . When they brought up the infamous Breaking Bad acid-bath moment in an interview with Jim Himes ( D-CT ) , the congressman remarked that " it 's gon na take a while to get the scene out of my head . " 
 <p> A new report out today says that Obama administration officials were " so concerned " about what would happen to documents related to the Russia investigation that they created a list to give to individuals on the Senate Intelligence Committee . <p> You may recall the report from earlier this month about how officials in the previous administration " scrambled " to make sure that information about Russian election interference was spread " across the government " before President Trump took office . <p> Now NBC News is reporting today that there were Obama administration officials who made a list of Russia-related documents because they were worried about what would happen " once President Trump took office " : <p> The official said that after the list of documents related to the probe into Russian interference in the U.S. election was created in early January , he hand-carried it to the committee members . The numbers themselves were not classified , said the official . <p> The purpose , said the official , was to make it " harder to bury " the information , " to share it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ documents , " and to make sure it could reside in an Intelligence committee safe , " not just at Langley CIA hq . " <p> Recent comments about Russia intelligence collection made this month on MSNBC by Evelyn Farkas , a former deputy assistant Secretary of Defense who left in 2015 , have received attention this week and Sean Spicer brought them up during today 's briefing .

They perform choreography , have legions of fans , wear fashionable ( and sort of matchy-matchy ) outfits , and are super-successful online , with 900,000 followers on Chinese social media giant Weibo . <p> They " came out " to fans during a recent show , according to Quartz . According to that piece , Chinese girl groups are often influenced by their Japanese J-pop counterparts , meaning they wear ponytails , knee socks , and other hyper-feminine attire . For Acrush to be , as their agent put it , " a group advocating freedom , not bounded by frames , " then , is pretty boundary-pushing , though it 's worth noting that women in masculine clothing have become more common in China in recent years . <p> Interestingly , the five women are barred from publicly talking about their own sexual orientations or behaviors , which is not uncommon for men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ region . 
 <p> " This is not my first case against Fox News and I do n't expect it will be my last , " she told Stelter . " There needs to be an independent investigation of sexual harassment at Fox News . " Bloom said that the one conducted by the firm Paul , Weiss after the ouster of Roger Ailes was insufficient . <p> " It 's already been dozens and dozens of women , " said an impassioned Bloom . " This network is the Bill Cosby of corporate America . " <p> Bloom is a frequent contributor to Fox rival NBC and has been tough on the network in the past . When Stelter suggested that the optics of a known critic of Fox and Donald Trump might play into Fox 's favor , Bloom had none of it . <p> " How many Gretchen Carlsons , How many Andrea Tantaros do we need ? " he said . " This has been going on since 2002 . Do women 's careers mean anything ? " 
 <p> Part 1 of the series , published Sunday , was aptly called " Our Dishonest President . " It offered a brutal if not wholly unique -- assessment of the 45th president . <p> What is most worrisome about Trump is Trump himself . He is a man so unpredictable , so reckless , so petulant , so full of blind self-regard , so untethered to reality that it is impossible to know where his presidency will lead or how much damage he will do to our nation . His obsession with his own fame , wealth and success , his determination to vanquish enemies real and imagined , his craving for adulation these traits were , of course , at the very heart of his scorched-earth outsider campaign ; indeed , some of them helped get him elected . But in a real presidency in which he wields unimaginable power , they are nothing short of disastrous . <p> Ouch . <p> In Part 2 , called " Why Trump Lies , " the paper speculated that the president 's wholesale embrace of alternative facts is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in many ways , was more analogous to the " self-serving blathering of a 6-year-old . " <p> Trump 's easy embrace of untruth can sometimes be entertaining , in the vein of a Moammar speech to the United Nations or the self-serving blathering of a 6-year-old . <p> Part 3 and 4 remain to be written . <p> The withering critique sets a new bar in the perpetual media race for most celebrated Trump takedown , and with polls showing the president 's approval ratings at historic lows , the climate has never been riper . 
 <h> Jake Tapper : ' Jared Kushner 's in Charge of the World , Apparently ' <p> CNN 's Jake Tapper this afternoon could n't help but remark upon exactly how much responsibility is being given to Jared Kushner a White House senior advisor and President Trump 's son-in-law in the government . <p> Aside from joining the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff in his trip to Iraq , Kushner is now running the Office of American Innovation and , as Tapper pointed out , being entrusted to work on Middle East peace , among other things . <p> He said , " Jared Kushner 's in charge of the world , apparently . " <p> Bloomberg White House Correspondent Margaret Talev said Kushner has basically been " handed ever major portfolio in the world . " Tapper asked , " ' Handed ' or is he grabbing them ? " <p> He also pointed out that Republicans would 've had serious problems if Hillary Clinton was president and this much responsibility was being given to Chelsea Clinton and her husband . 
 <h> Mercedes-Benz Says Ads During O'Reilly 's Show Have Been ' Reassigned in the Midst of This Controversy ' <p> A spokesperson for Mercedes-Benz said today that the company has pulled its ads from The O'Reilly Factor in light of the controversy this past weekend about sexual harassment settlements . <p> The settlements to five women who accused O'Reilly of sexual harassment were reported in the New York Times this past weekend . 21st Century Fox stood by O'Reilly in a statement that said , " Notwithstanding the fact that no current or former Fox News employee ever took advantage of the 21st Century Fox hotline to raise a concern about Bill O'Reilly , even anonymously , we have looked into these matters over the last few months and discussed them with Mr. O'Reilly . While he denies the merits of these claims , Mr. O'Reilly has resolved those he regarded as his personal responsibility . " <p> O'Reilly said in a personal statement that he is " vulnerable to lawsuits " and " no one has ever filed a complaint about me with the Human Resources Department , even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's " put to rest any controversies to spare my children . " <p> " Yes , we had advertising running on The O'Reilly Factor ( we run on most major cable news shows ) and it has been reassigned in the midst of this controversy , " said Donna Boland , the manager of corporate communications at Mercedes-Benz . " The allegations are disturbing and , given the importance of women in every aspect of our business , we do n't feel this is a good environment in which to advertise our products right now . " <p> CNN 's Tom Kludt notes in his report that " CNNMoney reached out to more than 20 companies and brands that have advertised on the ' O'Reilly Factor ' " since the Times report , and some of the others they 've reached out to " said they were looking into the matter .

 <p> No , maybe it just started with a Google search for the White Helmets . The White Helmets are a volunteer group in rebel-held Syria and were the subject of an Academy Award-winning documentary short . Most people can objectively agree that these are good people . <p> When Business Insider 's Natasha Bertrand looked them up recently , though , she found that their Google results are now prominently displaying a conspiracy theory that the group killed kids to fake all of those horrific videos from the recent Syrian gas attack . Conspiracy theories around the attack and Donald Trump 's decision to launch missiles over it have been rampant , sure , but at the top of Google results ? <p> Bertrand tweeted it ... <p> Related : The first article when you google " White Helmets " is a conspiracy theory about the org " murdering kids for a fake gas attack video " **26;453;TOOLONG 
 <p> At the end of today 's MediaBuzz , Fox News ' Howard Kurtz addressed the controversy at the network over allegations of harassment against Bill O'Reilly and dozens of advertisers pulling their spots from airing during the Factor as a result . <p> O'Reilly himself has not spoken about the matter on his show thus far . He released a statement last weekend that said , in part , " Just like other prominent and controversial people , I 'm vulnerable to lawsuits from individuals who want me to pay them to avoid negative publicity . In my more than 20 years at Fox News Channel , no one has ever filed a complaint about me with the Human Resources Department , even on the anonymous hotline . But most importantly , I 'm a father who cares deeply for my children and who would do anything to avoid hurting them in any way . And so I have put to rest any controversies to spare my children . " <p> " This has been a difficult and uncomfortable period for the people who work here , no question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on , to change the culture , and to make clear that any kind of harassment is unacceptable . And most of these allegations date from the Roger Ailes era , but the echoes of that era are still making news . "

The man was eventually let back on the flight , though he was reportedly bloody and disoriented from the encounter . The plane left the airport two hours behind schedule . <p> The videos received considerable online reactions from those who found the encounter disturbing : <p> " Flight 3411 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United spokesman who responded come to the gate . We apologize for the overbook situation . " 
 <h> Leaked Email : Trump Model Management is Going Out of Business <p> One of the more interesting but less covered Donald Trump stories during the campaign last year concerned Trump Model Management , the president 's modeling agency . Allegations of inhumane treatment of the models , many of whom were purportedly in the United States without proper work visas , abounded , but it did n't pick up much steam as a campaign issue . Regardless , according to an email obtained by Mother Jones on Monday , it looks like the agency is folding . <p> " The Trump Organization is choosing to exit the modeling industry , " wrote Trump Models president Corinne Nicolas . " On the heels of the recent sale of the Miss Universe Organization , the company is choosing to focus on their core businesses in the real estate , golf and hospitality space . Trump Models , during its 18-year run , was an amazing success and we are immensely proud of the opportunities that we have provided to so many talented individuals .

 <p> A Republican state senator in Florida is currently dealing with calls to step down from his post over racial slurs he spewed out to colleagues at a club Monday night . Unsurprisingly , alcohol was involved . <p> According tothe Miami Herald State Senator Frank Artiles used the n-word in front a couple of black lawmakers while engaged in a combative discussion with them . <p> Miami Republican Sen. Frank Artiles dropped the n-word to a pair of African-American colleagues in private conversation Monday night after calling one of them a " fucking asshole , " a " bitch " and a " girl , " the two senators said . Over drinks after 10 p.m. at the members-only Governors Club just steps from the state Capitol , Artiles told Sens . Audrey Gibson of Jacksonville and Perry Thurston of Fort Lauderdale that Senate President Joe Negron of Stuart had risen to his powerful GOP leadership role because " six niggers " in the Republican caucus had elected him . <p> Per Politico , Artiles attempted to defend his use of the slur by claiming that he actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that it was all cool because of where he resided . " I am not a racist , " he told the publication . 
 <p> If Carl Bernstein knows anything , he knows how anonymous sources can reveal how a high-level criminal cover-up can take an administration down . So when he stated that the FBI had a " serious belief " that there was an " active coverup " in the alleged between the Trump campaign and a Russian effort to reveal the election last night on AC360 , we take notice . <p> In a remarkably entertaining segment pegged to a CNN 's recent report , Bernstein dropped some knowledge about FBI suspicions . According the the Watergate legend , intelligence suggests that Russia tried to use advisers of Donald Trump to penetrate the presidential campaign . <p> Carter Page was named as one of these advisers , and the way he was referred to in the segment above , we hope that he was at a movie and not watching the panelists label him " an idiot " or even worse . Cooper wonder if he was a " useful idiot " who may have been unwittingly used as a compromised source of intelligence exchanged between Putin 's alleged efforts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

 <p> On Meet the Press this morning , Chuck Todd spoke with House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi about " what should unify the Democratic party " and asked her if it 's possible to be a Democrat and also pro-life . <p> Pelosi said " of course " it is , telling Todd she 's served for years with Democrats who do n't share her position on that issue . <p> She went on to argue that Democrats are unified on " our values " and " our commitment to America 's working families .

 <h> Here Are Some of the Highlights from This Weekend 's March for Science <p> Tens of thousands took to the streets this weekend as participants joined the March for Science all around the world . <p> The largest demonstration was based in Washington D.C. , but there were numerous cities around the world where scientists and advocates showed their support for the pursuit of knowledge . Bill Nye the Science Guy was one of several major speakers who appeared at the capitol . Other related demonstrations were also held in support of causes like environmental protection , medical research , and improving education . <p> March organizers said the event was n't meant to partisan , yet there were multiple instances where people openly protested President Trump and his administration 's approach to global warming and scientific funding . NPR spoke to Lucky Tran , one of yesterday 's march organizers , who insisted that the purpose was to defend science as a key component to freedom and prosperity . <p> I think the profession of science is under attack , and why is that happening ? Because we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in politics , we 've left that open for politicians to come in and really hijack and obfuscate science for their own selfish needs . <p> Naturally , the nationwide demonstration attracted thousands of people bearing protest signs and various unique methods to voice their activism . Many of these people made a point of showing their support through homages to all things nerdy and intellectual : 
 <p> Well it is n't exactly white smoke coming out of the Sistine Chapel , but it 's probably as close as we will get . <p> Mediaite has learned that Rupert Murdoch , current executive chairman and CEO of Fox News , took network co-presidents Bill Shine and Jack Abernethy to lunch today -- -- the day of Fox 's big new primetime lineup . Fox News has been embroiled in troubled waters , and some wondered what the future might hold for executives throughout the cable news ratings leader . <p> An AP photographer snapped two photos today of , according to the description , Murdoch leaving a " power lunch " spot Marea in Manhattan with both Shine and Abernethy . Industry insiders have suggested that this public show of support is indicates that the two have safe footing at the network , in the wake of Bill O'Reilly 's ousting last week after the multiple allegations of sexual harassment against him . <p> Shine and Abernethy were named co-presidents of Fox News last fall and were signed for multi-year contracts . The two co-presidents recently made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> As you 've no doubt heard by now , tonight Fox News kicks off its big new primetime lineup with Tucker Carlson at 8 and The Five at 9. 
 <h> Trump Tells Reuters There 's a Chance of a ' Major , Major Conflict With North Korea ' <p> One day after the highly unusual briefing in which all 100 Senators ventured to the White House for an update on North Korea , President Donald Trump is making his most dire public comments to date on the standoff . <p> Speaking with Reuters to mark the conclusion of his first 100 days in office , Trump painted a bleak picture with North Korea . Absolutely , " Trump said . <p> He added , " We 'd love to solve things diplomatically but it 's very difficult . " <p> " I seriously felt like I could have gotten all that information by reading a newspaper , " Duckworth said on CNN Wednesday . " I did not see any new information coming out of that briefing at all . It felt more like a dog and pony show to me than anything else . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ briefing , Trump 's Thursday comments make it clear that he believes the situation is becoming more serious . <p> In the interview with Reuters , Trump offered an assessment of North Korea 's leader , Kim Jong Un . <p> He 's 27 years old . His father dies , took over a regime . So say what you want but that is not easy , especially at that age . <p> I 'm not giving him credit or not giving him credit , I 'm just saying that 's a very hard thing to do . <p> But Trump punted on the question of the North Korea leader 's mental fitness . <p> " As to whether or not he 's rational , I have no opinion on it , " Trump said . " I hope he 's rational . " 
 <p> President Trump has not yet moved past the election results last year . And during interviews on his first 100 days with reporters this week , the president took out maps showing those results . <p> Jeff Mason , the head of the White House Correspondents Association and White House correspondent for Reuters , said on CNN yesterday Trump " sort of interrupted himself and handed out this map of the electoral college and said that these were the latest figures of the areas in the country that he had won in 2016 . " <p> And yes , he showed it off : <p> Mason appeared on CNN again this morning ( video below ) alongside The Washington Examiner 's Salena Zito ( also a CNN contributor ) , who provided some important context to the president bringing out those maps : <p> " In context , I had gone in there and asked him about that ... I was talking to him about counties and so he brought the map out and started talking . He and I went back and forth about the counties that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So we were having that discussion . " <p> CNN 's Michael Smerconish said that makes it sound like since Trump had the data already , when he spoke to Reuters next the election was at the forefront of his mind . <p> Mason did again say that when Reuters was speaking to Trump about China , the president " interrupted himself " to bring this up . <p> The Washington Post 's Philip Rucker spoke with MSNBC 's Chris Hayes last night and said he got to see the map too : <p> " He encouraged me to take it home to my colleagues at the Washington Post and try to run it on the front page of our newspaper . " <p> Hayes jumped in to ask if the President of the United States seriously asked him that . Rucker responded , " He did . I think he was sort of playing there , but it speaks to the pride that he has in that map . " 
 <p> The California representative has tweeted about it and led chants about it . She 's called it her " greatest desire . " Listen , this woman wants Trump out . Just in case she has n't already made it clear through all of that , she appeared on MSNBC today to tell Joy Reid how badly she wants to see him impeached , too . <p> While chatting with the weekend host , Waters said that the possible " Russia connection " is a " serious issue . " <p> " I 've always said that I believe there was collusion , " Waters enthused . " If we determine the facts , if the dots are connected that there has been collusion then I really do think that this president could be impeached . " <p> Like some of her colleagues , she said that Trump wants Americans to focus on other things but insisted it 's important that we all stay vigilant about the possibility of Russian collusion . 
 <p> Press Secretary Sean Spicer surprised reporters today when he ended up not taking any questions during Tuesday 's press briefing . <p> Mick Mulvaney , the director of the Office of Management and Budget , took over the bulk of today 's briefing where he slammed Senate Democrats for thinking they won government budget negotiations with President Trump by avoiding a shutdown . This came after the president tweeted complaints about Senate rules today , and said a government shutdown could end up happening in the future . <p> Spicer watched this from the side with other White House staffers , but when Mulvaney was done talking , Spicer left the briefing room along with the rest of his colleagues . Reporters yelled out " Sean ! " as they tried to ask some quick questions , but the press secretary did n't answer any of their calls back . 
 <h> ' That 's the Mecca ' : Tomi Lahren Says ' Of Course ' She 'd Work at Fox <p> After reaching a settlement with The Blaze , Tomi Lahren had a relatively anodyne interview come out in Playboy . One answer , though , really stuck out . <p> She was asked if she would ever work at Fox News . Here 's her answer : <p> Of course I would . I mean , that 's the Mecca . But I do n't care what the outlet is . I would work for MSNBC if I could be me and be authentic and genuine , and do what I do . That 's the thing about me : I can learn and I can grow , but you 're not getting some empty vessel that you can make with it what you want . I think I 've proven time and time again that I 'm not easily tamed . I would consider going anywhere . But I just want to be able to pursue what 's next . I want the freedom to find that out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conservative firebrand will end up . She 's only 24 but already gets millions and millions of views on everything she does , whether she 's railing against Beyonc ? or Colin Kaepernick . <p> Towards the end of election season , when Donald Trump was the presumed presidential loser , people even wondered if he 'd launch a network and bring her onboard . <p> And Fox News , as you know , has gone through quite a big shake-up recently , with Bill O'Reilly and network co-president Bill Shine both leaving the network over the past few weeks . <p> Lahren has , of course , never been too picky about where she appears . It was an appearance on ABC The View that got her booted from Glenn Beck 's The Blaze in the first place . Now that she has settled with The Blaze , she can go anywhere . <p> She did address the dueling lawsuits she and Beck had against one another , too . Specifically , she spoke about reports that it was bratty behavior on her part that got her ousted from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " One thing my parents never raised me to be was a diva , " Lahren insisted . " I 'm pretty low maintenance . I 'm the hardest worker you 'll ever meet . Anything to the contrary , I would look at the source and ask what their motivation is for saying this . Are they doing it because they really think that or are we in a lawsuit and they 're trying to smear me ? <p> By the way , in Playboy , she addressed the controversy over her admission that she does n't read . She said that what she meant was she does n't read fiction . Good to know . 
 <p> Yesterday , you may have heard , Hillary Clinton emerged from the woods to say she takes responsibility for her election loss ... but also that she probably would have won if not for James Comey and Wikileaks . <p> Comey has been testifying to before the Senate Judiciary Committee for a few hours now , and Senator Al Franken took a moment to scold fellow Senator John Cornyn for taking a shot at Clinton over those remarks . <p> Franken did not feel it was accurate for people to say Clinton " blamed everyone but herself " because " she took a lot of blame on herself in that forum . " <p> He did acknowledge what Clinton said about Comey and Wikileaks -- -- " she was only saying stuff other people have said " -- -- but insisted , " She did not blame everyone but herself . " 
 <p> After Charles Hurt earned of the Day honors Wednesday , the Washington Times columnist appears to be making a bid to retain his title belt . <p> In his column Tuesday , Hurt Kimmel as an " elitist creep " after the comedian 's stirring monologue in which he recounted his newborn son 's heart surgery , and then got political by advocating for pre-existing conditions to be covered in the new health care plan . <p> Wednesday on The Story with Martha McCallum , Hurt doubled down on his commentary when McCallum asked if Hurt 's criticism was harsh , given what Kimmel went through . <p> " Sure , " Hurt said . " But so is taking your i 'll child and inserting that child into the public arena and using them as a prop to push partisan political politics ( sic ) . I find that to be disgusting , personally . " <p> He added : " For Jimmy Kimmel to use his position and to use the terrible situation that was heart-wrenching for anybody that listened to it , to take that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ politics with it , it 's kind of like a bully who wants to just shut down debate . " <p> McCallum closed out the segment by saying that Hurt was " normally a very nice person , " and also mentioning our designating him Loser of the Day . ( Thanks for the shout out , Martha ! ) <p> After McCallum 's compliment , Hurt just laughed -- his clicks having been obtained , his Fox News spot having concluded . 
 <h> Watch How Morning Joe Covered the News of Mika and Joe 's Engagement <p> The news broke shortly before the start of their Thursday show . The morning show royalty tried to eschew news of their engagement on-air with a more sober discussion of James Comey , but their panel of regular guests was not going to let that happen . <p> Harold Ford Jr . got the ball rolling . <p> " First of all can I say something ? " he said . " Congratulations . Congratulations . " 
 <h> Charles Krauthammer : Trump is a ' Charlatan ' Like the ' Wizard of Oz ' <p> By this point , it 's not news that Conservative pundit Charles Krauthammer is no fan of Donald Trump . As a proud member of the Reaganite GOP old guard , he pointedly refused to vote for Trump in the election . <p> Now , in a new piece for the Washington Post , Krauthammer offered his view that Trump was a " charlatan " and essentially like the " Wizard of Oz . " Krauthammer added that he personally used the image of the president as a self-important do-nothing blunderbuss as a coping mechanism . <p> Per Krauthammer : <p> I simply view President Trump as the Wizard of and bombastic . A charlatan . Nothing behind the screen -- other than the institutional chaos that defines his White House and the psychic chaos that governs his ever-changing mind . What to do ? Ignore what 's behind the curtain . Deal with what comes out in front : the policy , the pronouncements , the actions . <p> That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however that his fantasy land approach had limitations specifically regarding what would happen during that infamous 3 a.m. phone call . <p> " What happens when the red phone rings at 3 in the morning ? , " asked Krauthammer . " I 'd say : Let it ring . Let the wizard sleep . Forward the call to Defense Secretary Mattis . " <p> Brutal . <p> The savagery is only the latest salvo from Krauthammer , who said on Fox News just last night that despite the House GOP health care victory , he suspected the country would ultimately come around to a Democratic single payer vision . 
 <p> This week , one of the main sources of outrage for many in the media and across the political spectrum has been Stephen Colbert 's profane , anti-Trump tirade during a broadcast of The Late Show . Not only were conservatives and Trump supporters offended by Colbert 's jokes , but many on the left criticized the late-night host for being homophobic when he said the president 's mouth was " Vladimir Putin 's . " <p> In a monologue this morning , CNN 's Michael Smerconish took aim at not only Colbert , but progressives in general , for overplaying their hand in opposing Trump by going low . <p> Explaining that Colbert 's jokes were more suitable for Real Time with Bill Maher than CBS , the " so-called Tiffany Network , " the CNN host said this amounted to " foolish politics . " Bringing up how the right lost credibility by letting their discomfort with President Obama devolve into birtherism , Smerconish warned the left their own " intolerance " could also be catching up with them . <p> After highlighting examples of progressives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their ideas in recent weeks , the commentator noted that the only person who really looks to benfit from all of this is Trump himself . <p> " The left it is understandably fired up but there 's only one beneficiary in a climate of liberal intolerance and that 's Donald Trump , " he exclaimed . " He 's helped when he is no longer the bad behaving outlier but the norm in a political atmosphere run amok . " 
 <p> The Nigerian government has confirmed that dozens of Chibok schoolgirls have been released after three years of captivity since their kidnapping at the hands of Boko Haram . <p> While it is unclear exactly how many girls were freed , Nigerian officials have told multiple newsagencies that they successfully negotiated the safe return of at least 60 girls from the terrorist group . The Nigerian Army took the girls into custody at the border town of Banki , and it has been reported that they will travel to Abuja for medical evaluations and family reunions . <p> It is believed that these girls are among the 276 students who were abducted from the Government Girls Secondary School back in 2014 . While some of the girls were able to get away from their captors over the last three years , there are still at least 100 students who are still unaccounted for . <p> For years , many of the kidnapped girls were feared to be dead , sold off as sex slaves , or forced to marry Islamic extremists . The Nigerian government is reportedly in contact with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Nigerian government say they are hoping that they will be able to negotiate more releases in the near future . <p> Nigerian officials have denied that they secured the girls ' release by paying a ransom or by freeing Boko Haram officers who were previously captured by authorities . 
 <p> Montel has multiple sclerosis , and he and Ana Cabrera began today 's CNN segment with by acknowledging that the disease is classified as a pre-existing condition under the Affordable Care Act . When asked for his response to the American Health Care Act , Williams pummeled the GOP by saying that they created the bill based on insurance company input , but without considering any data from other health institutions . <p> " These numbers that people throw out are so wrong , " Williams bemoaned . He went on to talk about how pre-existing conditions tend to be highly expensive , and that Americans should be wondering how the bill will lower costs while maintaining the accessibility of health care . 
 <p> In tackling the James Comey firing tonight , Bill Maher took a moment to say that " a lot of this is because of Bill Clinton . " <p> Maher said he was never on the anti-Comey bandwagon during the campaign , calling the ex-FBI director a " boy scout . " <p> But after taking a shot at liberals for opposing Comey over " purity " issues , Maher went on to say , " A lot of this is because of Bill Clinton . " <p> He invoked that infamous meeting on the tarmac with Loretta Lynch and how after that , Lynch said she would accept the FBI 's recommendation and it was Comey who ended up making that public statement : <p> " Bill Clinton , once again , fucked up his wife 's life . If Bill Clinton had n't walked on Loretta Lynch 's plane , then she would have been making the statement instead of Comey ... That 's where we are . Bill Clinton . Let 's put the blame where it belongs . " 
 <h> There Is a Noticeable Lack of Trump Administration Faces Appearing On the Sunday Shows Tomorrow <p> Well , almost none of Donald Trump 's administration members or surrogates will be on the Sunday shows tomorrow . <p> That 's not normal . <p> It 's also not for lack of trying on the part of bookers , producers , and showrunners . While talking yesterday about Trump 's sudden firing of FBI director James Comey , Fox News ' Chris Wallace said , " We 're waiting -- just to give you an example -- we very much want somebody to represent the president 's point of view on Sunday about the Comey firing . They still have n't given us anybody ; we ca n't even reach anybody to ask . " Watch that above . <p> It wo n't surprise you to learn that the problem is n't exclusive to Fox . There are no White House spokespeople to be found on any of the Sunday show schedules tomorrow . The shocking news is even leading the current edition of Brian Stelter 's " Reliable Sources " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes on the heels of the big week we just had that started with Sally Yates ' testimony and James Comey 's firing , and ended with the president seemingly threatening Comey about supposed " tapes " of their conversations and suggesting doing away with press briefings for the sake of " accuracy " from his spokespeople . <p> We did just receive word that Rex Tillerson will do Meet the Press tomorrow . That 's all fine and well , but we 'll be interested to see if defending a whirlwind week full of surprises and contradictions for the president is suddenly one of the Secretary of State 's duties . <p> UPDATE -- -- 1:05 pm ET : We should also note that Kellyanne Conway is set to appear on Fox 's media affairs show MediaBuzz tomorrow . The show 's page says that she will be on to discuss " the coverage of the James Comey firing , President Trump 's criticism of the media and a host of related issues . " <p> UPDATE -- -- 7:29 pm ET : ABC 's This Week has announced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will appear on their show tomorrow . 
 <p> NBC News and Wall Street Journal released a new joint poll over the weekend , and the numbers suggest that most Americans do n't approve of how things are going with regard to James Comey and the FBI 's investigation on Russia 's election meddling . <p> The poll was taken from May 11 -- 13 , and only 29% of the participants approved President Donald Trump 's decision to fire the former FBI director . Thirty percent of responders said that Trump 's decision gave them a less positive view of him , and even though the incident did n't drastically change Trump 's approval numbers , they remain near a low 39% . <p> The poll goes on to indicate that 78% of Americans believe that the investigation on Russia 's activities should be handed off to an independent commission or a special prosecutor . The reasoning for Comey 's firing also saw a bipartisan split among responders . <p> Forty-six percent of participants ( including 74% of polled Democrats ) say Trump was trying to slow down the investigation into potential campaign collusion with Russia . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ including a polled Republican majority ) agree with the Trump Administration 's explanation that Comey was fired for mishandling the investigation of Hillary Clinton 's email scandal . <p> Trump 's decision set off a political earthquake last week , and the White House continues to face questions over their contradicting explanations and the timing of Comey 's termination . During an interview last night , Trump told Fox 's Jeanine Pirro that he did n't see the point of allowing for the investigation to be turned over to an independent commission . 
 <p> National security adviser H.R. McMaster briefed White House reporters Tuesday in an attempt to rebut reports that President Donald Trump divulged highly classified information to Russian officials , thereby creating national security risks for the United States and its allies . <p> McMaster pushed back on the reports , disputing the " premise " of the Washington Post story that Trump 's comments jeopardized an intelligence source . McMaster called Trump 's remarks in the meeting as " wholly appropriate . " <p> " The president was n't even aware of where this information came from , " McMaster said , referring to the classified information Trump divulged to Sergey Lavrov and Sergey Kislyak . <p> " He was n't briefed on the source or method of information either , " McMaster added . <p> McMaster did not deny that Trump revealed to the Russian officials the Middle Eastern city that the intelligence came from . <p> As many commentators have noted , McMaster 's claims that Trump did not jeopardize the source of the intelligence does not entail a denial that Trump shared highly classified information with the Russians . 
 <p> As another bombshell story is thrown onto the pile -- this time reporting that former FBI Director James Comey claimed that President Donald Trump told him to close an investigation into Mike Flynn -- Fox News has struggled to get Republicans on air to defend the president . <p> According to the Times report , Comey said Trump told him : " I hope you can let this go . " <p> In the wake of the shocking report , Fox News scrambled to get Republican lawmakers on air to defend the president -- but they 're apparently in short supply . <p> As Fox host Bret Baier noted on Special Report Tuesday night , " we 've tried tonight to get Republicans to come out and talk to us , and there are not Republicans willing to go on camera tonight as of yet . " <p> " And we 'll see if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appeared on Special Report to confirm Baier 's claim , adding " what I think is really stunning is that nobody , not even from the White House , has come out under their own name in defense of the president here . " <p> " We do n't see any Republicans on camera , " Krauthammer noted . " And that is totally understandable . They 've just watched over the last ten days , people who went out on a limb on the Comey firing , and said it was the result of the memo from the deputy Attorney General , and had they 're limb sawn off by Donald Trump himself without a flinch , " left " humiliated and contradicted . " <p> " So who is going to step out now and defend the president in these denials ? " Krauthammer said . 
 <h> GOP Congresswoman From Arizona Threatened For Support of Trump <p> An employee of Tucson , Arizona 's school district was arrested after the FBI traced three voicemails threatening Rep. Martha McSally to his phone number . <p> According to a Tuesday article from The Washington Post , Steve Martan left " expletive-filled " death threats on the Republican politician 's office line on May 2 and 10 . During the second voicemail , Martan allegedly warned he would " pull the trigger " when she returned to Arizona and " shoot her between the eyes . " <p> The suspect later " told McSally her ' days are numbered ' " in the third recording . Federal law enforcement officials tracked down after this third message , and he revealed his motive , according to the criminal complaint : " Martan told authorities he called the congresswoman 's office because ' he was venting frustrations with congressional votes in support of the President of the United States . ' " <p> The Post 's report pointed out that Rep. McSally represents " Arizona 's 2nd Congressional District , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the head in an assassination attempt in 2011 . Six people were killed and 13 others wounded . " She began her second term in January 2017 . <p> McSally is n't the first Republican representative to be threatened in recent days . A woman allegedly tried to run Tennessee Congressman David Kustoff off the road after a town hall event at the University of Tennessee at Martin on May 8 , 2017. 
 <p> This is a day that media types will frame with the question , " Do you remember where you were when it happened ? " The hosts of Fox &amp; Friends , one of the most successful shows on the network , were at work . In fact , they were on air . <p> Watch above as an emotional Ainsley Earhardt and stoic Steve Doocy make the announcement . You 'll recall that when Ailes was originally accused of sexual harassment last summer , Earhardt was one of the Fox News hosts who most publicly defended him . In fact , she did it in an interview with Mediaite . <p> Doocy and Earhardt took it in turns to read the statement left by Ailes 's wife before Brian Kilmeade cut over to a commercial . <p> Obviously , we will have more on this story as it develops . For now , just watch the reactions of the F &amp; F team for an idea of what 's going on at Fox today . You can see a fuller follow-up segment from the show below : <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broadcast . 
 <p> Senator John McCain was apparently in a fiesty mood on Thursday . Hours after calling for throwing the Turkish ambassador " the hell out of the United States of America , " the Republican politician had additional blunt words for the liberal critics of his friend , Joe Lieberman . <p> " Joe Lieberman has more experience than all of my Dem . colleagues combined , " McCain said to PBS correspondent Lisa Desjardins . " So screw them . And you can quote me . " <p> The Arizona senator was answering Desjardins ' question about Democratic senators ' concerns over President Donald Trump nominating Lieberman to be FBI director . The former Connecticut senator was among four top officials interviewed by the President for the law enforcement job . 
 <h> Apparently Nobody on Morning Joe Has Read The Art of the Deal <p> On Friday 's edition of Morning Joe , the gang took stock of the blizzard of scandals and revelations we have enjoyed this week , courtesy of Donald J. Trump . <p> Joe Scarborough told the group that the secret to understanding Trump lay in The Art of the Deal -- a book the president mentioned once or twice on the campaign trail . <p> " If you want to understand Donald Trump , you do n't have to read The Art of the Deal . You need to read the first page of The Art of the Deal , " he told his panel . <p> Then the money question . <p> " Has anybody read Art of the Deal here ? " <p> Now it was fast , and Scarborough moved on pretty quickly to explaining his point , but in a show known for spirited guests jabbering over each other , it was noteworthy that nobody said yes , or offered any answer . The very question itself seemed to stun guests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He said I do n't plan ahead . I just show up in the office . I wait for phone calls to come in , I wait for things to happen . I do n't plan things out , things just happen , and when they happen , I react to them . And that really was for anybody who knew Donald Trump in New York , that 's how his business ran , and at times that worked for him . " <p> The former GOP Congressman , however , said that approach was not flying in the White House . <p> " It 's clear that 's now he 's trying to run his White House , and that 's why four months in he 's having to hire criminal lawyers . It 's just an absolute train wreck and this man at 70 years old is stuck in his habits . He does not appear to be changing . " 
 <p> Add Rolling Stone writer Matt Taibbi to the list of those who are n't sad to see Ailes gone . In what can only be described as a nasty takedown of the head , Taibbi blamed Ailes for creating the " media environment " American public -- described as " a hate-filled , paranoid , untrusting , book-dumb and bilious people " -- currently finds itself in . <p> Then he had this to say about the man who had just passed away : <p> Ailes was the Christopher Columbus of hate . When the former daytime TV executive and political strategist looked across the American continent , he saw money laying around in giant piles . He knew all that was needed to pick it up was a ) the total abandonment of any sense of decency or civic duty in the news business , and b ) the factory-like production of news stories that spoke to Americans ' worst fantasies about each other . <p> After highlighting Ailes ' history with Fox News and how he believed the network was responsible for pushing outlandish conspiracy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the piece with this observation : <p> The extent to which we hate and fear each other now -- that 's not any one person 's fault . But no one person was more at fault than Roger Ailes . He never had a soul to sell , so he sold ours . It may take 50 years or a century for us to recover . Even dictators rarely have that kind of impact . Enjoy the next life , you monster . 
 <h> White House Official Reportedly Identified as Person of Interest in Russia Probe <p> The Washington Postis reporting that the investigation into potential collusion between the Donald Trump campaign and Russia has fingered a current White House official as a " significant person of interest . " <p> The senior White House adviser under scrutiny by investigators is someone close to the president , according to these people , who would not further identify the official . <p> The revelation comes as the investigation also appears to be entering a more overtly active phase , with investigators shifting from work that has remained largely hidden from the public to conducting interviews and using a grand jury to issue subpoenas . The intensity of the probe is expected to accelerate in the coming weeks , the people said . <p> White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer provided a statement in response to this story : <p> " As the President has stated before -- a thorough investigation will confirm that there was no collusion between the campaign and any foreign entity . " <p> The WaPo 's sources noted that beyond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on former campaign and administration associates and officials such Michael Flynn . It was reported this week that back in February right after Flynn resigned as national security advisor , Trump asked then-FBI Director James Comey to stop the investigation into Flynn . <p> Flynn was ousted following the disclosure he had spoken to Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak during the transition and was n't forthright about the discussions . Since then , it has been revealed that both Attorney General Jeff Sessions and senior advisor -- and Trump son-in-law -- Jared met with Kislyak prior to the election . ( Sessions had to recuse himself from any probes into the Trump campaign due to the conversations . ) <p> And just today , as the same time as the WaPo blockbuster , the New York Times reported that during his Oval Office meeting with Russian officials last week , Trump referred to Comey as a " nut job " and indicated that the Russia probe was behind the firing . 
 <h> Speculation Jared Kushner May Be the White House Person of Interest in Russia Probe Gains Steam <p> Following the Washington Post report that a White House official is being looked at as a " significant person of interest " in the investigation into Russian election interference , NBC legal analyst Ari Melber Tweeted the following : <p> Still , no major American news organization has reported that Kushner is the person described in the Washington Post story . Following his speculative Tweet , Melber participated in a segment on For The Record , in which he did not repeat any of what he Tweeted about Kushner . And during the same segment , NBC 's Ken Dilanian specifically stated that NBC News was unable to confirm the identity of the person . <p> Later in the show , guest Malcolm Nance , a retired US intelligence officer , said " it sounds like Jared Kushner . " Host Chris Jansing quickly interrupted and said Nance 's statement has n't been confirmed . <p> But it appears such speculation about Kushner will only grow until it is confirmed or debunked. 
 <h> Disney World Reportedly Struggling With How to Add Trump to Hall of Presidents <p> The election of Donald Trump has reportedly thrown the Imagineers down at Disney World into a tricky situation . <p> See , at Disney World , they have a Hall of Presidents . Since 1993 , a lot of the animatronic presidents -- which all accurately represent the appearance of the 44 presidents we 've had thus far -- have spoken during the short presentation , which features music and a lesson in American history . The issue now is that we 've elected a president whose speech is n't quite as , uh , measured as his predecessors ' . When Trump speaks , he 's liable to insult someone or spill classified information . <p> So , what are the people tasked with making the Trump robot to do ? <p> According to Motherboard , they 're definitely adding him but they 're not going to let him speak . Here 's the relevant paragraph : <p> Motherboard spoke via email and phone to a source close to Walt Disney Imagineering -- the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And according to the source , Donald Trump will be in the attraction , but he will probably not have a speaking role , unlike the three presidents immediately before him . The Imagineers will likely revert the attraction to its pre-1993 format , where the current president does not speak , while keeping the more realistic , grounded tone of the current show . <p> Reportedly , Trump has not been complying with Disney 's requests to help anyway , so that could be leveraged as the public excuse for why his robot does n't speak . Similarly , they could say that they want to cut down the running time of the whole thing . <p> Here 's one more interesting tidbit : the Motherboard source said , " Given President Trump 's current problems , Walt Disney World might elect to push the attraction 's opening date back to the fall and then make further tweaks to the show . " 
 <p> In the video above , you see Trump dancing during his trip to Saudi Arabia . According to CNN 's Jim Acosta , he did a little " jig . " <p> There has been a lot of drama for Trump and the people who live in the country he presides over lately . From the firing of James Comey to the revelation that he probably gave Russians classified info and told them he fired Comey to ease the investigation into his possible Russian ties to the other revelation that Comey had notes proving Trump tried to obstruct some justice , we all need to dance . Trump probably really needs to dance . 
 <h> Tired of Winning : Trump Approval Rating At Lowest Since Inauguration <p> Remember when Donald Trump said that his presidency would make everyone tired of winning ? He was right . Even he 's tired of it , which is saying something . <p> No , really . His latest approval ratings are lower than they have been since the inauguration . His disapproval now stands at 56% , per a Reuters poll . Look : <p> The May 14-18 opinion poll found that 38 percent of adults approved of Trump while 56 percent disapproved . The remaining 6 percent had " mixed feelings . " <p> There are a lot of factors that could contribute to this , but it 's likely that his firing of James Comey looked just suspicious enough to lure some people off that Trump Train . After that , he more or less admitted it was done to curtain the investigation into his possible Russian ties and a special counsel was assigned to the investigation . Oh , and it 's been reported that he said something similar to Russian ambassadors in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but during which he also reportedly told them classified information . 
 <p> Now , we 've covered former British politician and current conspiracy theorist Louise Mensch before . She 's made a name for herself in recent months by diving headlong into the Trump collusion story . While it should be pointed out that she has proven to be prescient in the past about certain things , one look at her Twitter timeline and website will give you the impression that EVERYONE is caught up in the Russia web , leaving her credibility , let 's just say , in question . <p> In this vein , she published a blockbuster blog post today that claimed that she 's been informed by multiple sources that President Trump was notified just before his foreign trip that a case of impeachment had begun . <p> Sources further say that the Supreme Court notified Mr. Trump that the formal process of a case of impeachment against him was begun , before he departed the country on Air Force One . The notification was given , as part of the formal process of the matter , in order that Mr. Trump knew he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suspects in Trump-Russia cases . Sources have confirmed that the Marshal of the Supreme Court spoke to Mr. Trump . <p> So , yeah . That 's not how this works , That 's not how any of this works . <p> And folks on Twitter had an absolute field day at Mensch 's expense after they saw the post : 
 <p> MSNBC 's Rachel Maddow spoke to Access Hollywood about the death of Roger Ailes , where she said it was a " shock " for her because she considered the former Fox News chairman as a " friend " and a " mentor " to her . <p> Speaking with Natalie Morales and Kit Hoover , Maddow said that she had a " collegial friendship " with Ailes ever since she asked him to review her performances on TV . Maddow acknowledged that Ailes ' sexual harassment scandals were a " huge deal " , but she went on to say that it was undeniable that Ailes had a major impact on the cable news business before he was fired from his network . <p> " The reason that he left is dire stuff , " Maddow said . " But this corner of the news business , I think it 's worth noting , really , was created by Ailes .... All of us in cable news had something to do with him because he was formative . " <p> Maddow went on to talk about several interactions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where she sought his advice about how to improve her on-air presence . Maddow did eventually come back to Fox News , where she talked about how Ailes ' departure preceded other sexual harassment troubles within the network . <p> " I do n't want to dismiss any of the serious allegations that were made against Ailes that resulted in him being fired from that job , but there were other things to know about him too , and my experience with him was professional and supportive and interesting . " 
 <p> Senator John McCain said this morning he 's " almost speechless " at the report of what President Trump said to top Russian officials about James Comey . <p> He has used the word " scandal " recently in talking about where the Russia investigation is going , and McCain told Chris Wallace on Fox News Sunday this morning , " With the appointment of Mr. Mueller , we 've now hit that stage of a scandal . " <p> Wallace also asked McCain why he thinks Trump fired the FBI director . The Arizona senator said , " I do n't know . Honestly , I can not explain a lot of the president 's actions . I do n't think it was a wise thing to do . Mr. Comey was highly respected and highly regarded . And so I ca n't explain it . I do n't think it was a smart thing to do . " <p> As for the report that Trump told the Russian ambassador and foreign minister that Comey was a " nut job " and the " great pressure " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this to say : <p> " I do n't know how to read it except that ... I 'm almost speechless because I do n't know why someone would say something like that . " <p> National Security Advisor H.R. McMaster -- -- whom McCain has praised in the past -- -- said on ABC this morning that the president was conveying that he " feels as if he 's hamstrung in his ability to work with Russia , to find areas of cooperation , because this has obviously been so much in the news . " 
 <p> Charlotte 's WCNC-TV has found itself at the center of a social media firestorm after interviewing a high school senior named Summer who likely wo n't walk the stage at the Hickory Ridge High School graduation . <p> It all started when Summer , an honors student with multiple scholarships to schools in the fall , wore an off-the-shoulder shirt , which violates the dress code . In her interview , she stated she had it pulled up . She also stated that she and her principal , Michelle Cline , had a history , which made the moment when Cline approached the student about the outfit all the more precarious . <p> If the suspension holds and Summer does not walk at graduation , the girl with a 4.4 GPA runs the risk of not getting to utilize her scholarships . That 's why tweets with the information for the school have been going viral , too . <p> Still , as the Independent out , we only know one side of the story . Mediaite has reached out to the principal in question to find out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the story that is going wild on Twitter . <p> Dress codes have long been a contentious topic as they are seen by many as archaic and oppressive to female students ( or employees ) in particular . 
 <p> Paparazzi pictures are complicated for fans . To enjoy one , you have to like a celebrity , but not really love them . If you 're a casual celebrity observer , photos of Kim Kardashian taking North West to ballet are fun . If you 're an actual fan of the family , you might want to see the photos , but feel conflicted knowing a mother and small child had to fight a hoard of photographers to get to their engagement . <p> Today , the Daily Mail ran a photo of Ariana Grande back in America after the terrorist attack that took place during one of her concerts in the U.K. last night . The people who replied to the tweet fall beyond that second camp of fans who love to hate and hate to love the paps . The people who responded to this tweet were diehard Grande defenders who were not happy to see a photo of their idol so soon after she tweeted about being " broken " by the events of the last day . <p> Here are some of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you : 
 <p> How could we forget her ? In one of 2016 's most explosive cable news showdowns , Duca -- a contributor -- and Carlson slugged it out in a tense , fiery segment . That night , Duca ripped Carlson as a " partisan hack , " while Carlson said , " You should stick to the thigh-high boots . " <p> Thursday night , Carlson said he regretted his conduct during his interview with Duca . <p> Carlson said that Duca , " delivered a performance so mindless and nasty that I lost control and snapped at her . I should n't have done it , but I did . " <p> But lest you think it was all sunshine and rainbows from Carlson , the Fox News host promptly pivoted and again tore into Duca . ( Whose rise to prominence Carlson took credit for Thursday night , saying , " We 're happy to make people famous . " ) Calling her " vapid , " and " not very impressive , " Carlson ripped Duca for a now-deleted tweet in which she wrote " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ added an image of a plane on fire . 
 <h> H.R. McMaster Excluded From of Trump-Netanyahu Meeting <p> National security advisor H.R. McMaster was left out of a meeting between President Donald Trump and Israeli Prime Minister on Monday , a move that raised eyebrows among officials . <p> According to Kafe Knesset , Trump met with Netanyahu Monday evening , starting with a one-on-one meeting . The forum was soon expanded by several advisors on each side , including Jared Kushner , Jason Greenblatt and Ambassador David Friedman on the U.S. side , according to Israeli officials . <p> Secretary of State Rex Tillerson was also later invited to the expanded meeting , per an official , but " McMaster sat outside the King David room during the course of the entire meeting . " <p> Former U.S. officials told Kafe Knesset that the national security advisor 's exclusion from the meeting was " highly unusual . " <p> " For the President to prioritize his son-in-law and his lawyer over the National Security Advisor for these kind of strategic discussions is unconventional , to say the least , " an official said . <p> This would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prioritize his family in official meetings . After leaving Jerusalem for the Vatican , the president met with the Pope with a small entourage , including first lady Melania , his daughter Ivanka and son-in-law Jared . Press secretary Sean Spicer , a devout catholic and reported , was excluded . <p> As Kafe Knesset also points out , McMaster 's absence from the meeting with Netanyahu came after a week of statements from the National Security Adviser that " raised some eyebrows in Jerusalem " : <p> First , he announced that the President intends to use the meeting to express " his desire for dignity and self-determination for the Palestinians , " which , by the way did not end up happening . Then , during a press briefing , he twice refused to say whether the Western Wall is part of Israel , dodging questions on the topic with the answer : " That is a policy decision . " 
 <p> According to ABC News , President Donald Trump 's two oldest sons visited with the FBI earlier this month to discuss an attempted hack of the Trump Organization . <p> Officials told ABC that they confirmed the overseas cyberattack attempt and held a meeting with Donald Trump Jr . and Eric Trump in New York on May 8th , which just happened to be the day before their father fired FBI Director James Comey . <p> In response to the story , Eric Trump would n't confirm or deny the meeting took place , but did insist to ABC News that no hack occurred . <p> This reported investigation comes at a time when the White House is currently dealing with an expanding investigation into possible collusion between Trump associates and Russia regarding election interference . In the wake of Comey 's termination , the administration has been rocked by numerous bombshell reports that have led to cries of " obstruction of justice " from pundits and Democrats ( and some Republicans ) . 
 <p> " I thought we had passed the days where it was acceptable for political leaders at local and national levels to bestow legitimacy on hate speech and fringe ideologies , " Biden said . " But the world is changing so rapidly there are a lot of folks out there who are afraid , and susceptible to this kind of negative appeal . " <p> Biden commented on " the forces of populism not only here , but around the world , " ostensibly a reference to the rising support for populist politicians -- from President Donald Trump to France 's Marine Le Pen and the Netherlands ' Geert Wilders . <p> Biden also slammed anti-immigrant rhetoric , rejecting Trump 's " call to close our nation 's gates against the challenges of a rapidly changing world . " <p> " The immigrant , the minority , the transgender , anyone not like me , became a scapegoat , " he added . <p> In a clear jab at Trump , Biden decried the idea that immigrants are the root of America 's problems . " Just build a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They 're the reason I ca n't compete , they 're the reason I do n't have a job , that 's why I worry about my safety , " he said . <p> Biden then called the rising tide of nationalism in the United States " incredibly disorienting and disheartening . " <p> But he had some reassurances for the graduates : " your reaction , you graduates in particular , is understandable , " Biden said . " But I assure you that this is a temporary state of affairs . " <p> " The American people will not sustain this attitude for long , I promise you , " he said . 
 <p> Angelo Carusone , president of Media Matters , joined Michael Smerconish on CNN Saturday to defend his calls to boycott Hannity 's program . <p> " I am trying to provide information about Sean Hannity to people that have to make business decisions about their relationship with Sean Hannity , " Carusone said . <p> Smerconish asked if the campaign amounts to censorship , which Carusone pushed back on : " I do n't think that it is censorship if a company does n't want to associate with or give money to a personality , " he said . " I 'm not saying Sean Hannity should n't be able to say the things he says , I 'm just saying that businesses should have some intentionality behind their advertising . " <p> Media Matters has often used the tactic of pressuring advertisers to abandon programs the group deems problematic . Media Matters kickstarted the campaign to boycott Bill O'Reilly 's program in the wake of a number of sexual harassment allegations leveled against the Fox elder statesman . <p> Smerconish pointed out that Hannity 's advertisers are not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in March , which preceded his ouster from the network . <p> Carusone responded that the goal of Media Matters is simply to inform advertisers of " the depth of volatility or riskiness associated with Sean Hannity 's programming . " <p> He also noted that some advertisers are indeed uninformed about their own advertising on Hannity 's program : " one company , Crowne Plaza , were so upset that their ads were running in the first place , that they fired their media buyer , " Carusone said . <p> He concluded that the fact that " Sean Hannity is volatile and bad business " should ultimately drive the decisions of advertisers . 
 <p> CNN 's Dylan Byers refreshingly acknowledged early on Friday morning that the mainstream media has an implicit slant towards the left . <p> " On occasion , more than the media would probably like to admit , we have not told the story of conservative Americans -- disenfranchised Americans -- who believe that they are losing their country , " Byers said , in a segment first flagged by The Right Scoop . " The story we have largely been telling is a story that is more or less in step with the arc of history as defined by Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton . " <p> The CNN senior media reporter continued with a qualifier : " That does n't mean we favor them to win . It just means that that sort of vision of a progressive future -- a global future -- and that is not one that resonates with so many conservative American voters . " <p> Byers also asserted that due to the disconnect between the media and conservatives , " there is this chasm , and no one exploited it as well as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ violent and aggressive and sinister as Donald Trump did . " This , in his view , laid the groundwork for Greg Gianforte 's assault Jacobs . <p> " That laid the foundation for the sorts of incidents that happened last night , " Byers said . <p> Earlier in the segment , the CNN correspondent highlighted the apparent " conversation that 's happening among people who follow the news industry -- which is , how can we bridge the , sort of , gap between all of those conservatives who do n't trust the media , and get them to start knowing that -- you know , we 're acting in good faith , with good intentions ? " <p> Byers contended , " Maybe you ca n't , because they 're not even listening ... They 're just not paying attention ... because they do n't trust us . " <p> The journalist soon added that " over the course of several decades , the conservatives have done a masterful job at capitalizing on the waning trust in media among conservatives , and using it to their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Beyers segment above , via CNN . 
 <h> Jeopardy ! Star Ken Jennings Mocks Barron Trump <p> A Wednesday Tweet from top Jeopardy ! champion Ken Jennings appeared to mock President Donald Trump 's youngest son , Barron Trump , who reportedly Griffin 's vile decapitation stunt and thought his father was dead . <p> The Jeopardy ! champion later explained that his initial Tweet was actually mocking how the President and his supporters apparently used Barron in a political manner . He cited a Wednesday Tweet from OANN anchor Liz Wheeler . <p> The joke does n't mock Barron . It mocks using him for political cover ... and specifically this amazing tweet : https : 
 <p> The Trump White House is reportedly seriously considering allowing Russia to resume its use of two diplomatic facilities that were shuttered during the final weeks of the Obama administration in December 2016 . <p> According to a Wednesday evening report from The Washington Post , the administration indicated to the Russian government in April 2017 that " it would consider turning the properties , " which are located on Maryland 's Eastern Shore and on New York 's Long Island , " back over to them if Moscow would lift its freeze ... on construction of a new U.S. consulate on a certain parcel of land in St. Petersburg . " <p> The United States government 's position apparently changed less than a week later , according to the newspaper 's unnamed sources , as " Secretary of State Rex Tillerson told Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak at a meeting in Washington , that the United States had dropped any linkage between the compounds and the consulate . " <p> However , a senior aide to the top American diplomat downplayed any possible agreement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had accused Russia of using the Maryland and New York facilities for " intelligence-related purposes . " They gave the foreign government 24 hours to evacuate both compounds , " as punishment for Moscow 's interference in the 2016 presidential election , " according to the newspaper 's article . 
 <h> Watch the Shocking Dashcam Footage of Tiger Woods ' DUI Arrest <p> The Jupiter , FL police department has released the footage of Tiger Woods ' DUI arrest early Monday , and it is shocking to watch . <p> At one point in the footage ( via theNew York Post , Woods is being held by one officer as he 's being searched by another . He is , at one point , a bit slow to respond to an officer 's command . He is also visibly sleepy . <p> Woods has admitted that prescription medications were involved in the incident , but maintained he did not consume any alcohol . Woods took a breathalyzer , which showed no alcohol in his system . 
 <p> Following the onslaught of nearly universal disdain that erupted in the wake of Kathy Griffin 's " ISIS-style " photograph of herself holding the severed head of President Donald Trump , Fox News ' Tucker Carlson spent a few minutes lambasting the liberal comedian on his show this evening . <p> According to the conservative talk show host and certified ratings bonanza , the main problem with Griffin and her ilk is n't necessarily their political opinions or how they choose to express them -- tastefully or not -- but that these days , liberals simply are n't funny . <p> Carlson said : <p> " Kathy Griffin got canned by CNN this afternoon , a day after she posted a picture of herself posing ISIS-style with Donald Trump 's bloody severed head . The image itself was appalling , violent , creepy , weird ... But it was also -- and this may be the main problem -- totally unfunny . Kathy Griffin bills herself as a comedian but this was not comedy , it was a political stunt of the dumbest kind . Your eighth-grader would n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't a departure for griffin . She has n't been funny in years -- assuming she ever was . People clap for her not because they are amused but because they agree with her politics . That 's not art . It 's affirmation . " <p> The Fox News host then went on to list a series of liberal comedians he also deemed guilty of substituting political allegiances for humor including ; Samantha Bee , Bill Maher , and Trevor Noah . <p> " They are just playing to the biases and vanities of their audience , " Carlson said . " And it 's working , unfortunately , which means they 're all the exactly the same , prisoners of conformity , which is always the sworn enemy of art . " 
 <p> Economist Jeff Sachs absolutely went off against President Donald Trump and the White House at large for the decision to withdraw from the Paris climate accord on CNN Friday . <p> " It 's just unbelievable , " Sachs said . " Every word has been a lie for the last two days . " <p> And then , he turned his fire on fellow CNN panelist and former Trump consultant Stephen Moore , who is CNN 's senior economic analyst . He also is a distinguished visiting fellow at the Heritage Foundation , a conservative think tank that is , at least in part , funded by the Koch brothers . <p> And it is this latter role that Sachs believes disqualifies Moore from being a CNN analyst . <p> And you have Stephen Moore . And he is from the Heritage Foundation , paid for by the Koch brothers that have engineered the whole story here . So it 's just endless big money of the Koch brothers is behind this . And Mr. Moore and his heritage foundation is a Koch brothers-financed operation . And this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's disgusting after a while because they 're all lying . <p> Moore responded : <p> " Jeff just needs to get his facts straight , " Moore said . " We get less than three percent of our budget from the Kochs. " 
 <h> CNN Host on Trump : ' This Piece of Sh*t ... Disgrace to Humankind ' <p> Reza Aslan , host of CNN 's Believer , tore into Donald Trump on Saturday after the president decided to invoke the ongoing situation in London with his policy agenda . <p> British police are reacting to potential terror attacks that took place around London Bridge and Borough Market earlier this evening . Before the fatal incidents were formally considered terror accidents , Trump tweeted about how badly America needs to ban travelers from several majority-Muslim countries . <p> Evidently , Aslan was not impressed by Trump 's tweets . <p> This piece of shit is not just an embarrassment to America and a stain on the presidency . He 's an embarrassment to humankind. https : //t.co/Dl5tMQMhMO 
 <p> You do n't know of the Washington Generals ? They are the " professional " basketball team that played exhibition games against the Harlem Globetrotter and LOST EVERY GAME . But ! They were n't playing to win ( or even compete . ) They showed up only so fans could enjoy the Globetrotters ' basketball hijinks without an opponent ... that always lost . <p> Which brings us to CNN panelist Jeffrey Lord . <p> If you 've watched CNN recently you 've seen a lot of Trump surrogate Jeffrey Lord opining in what increasingly feels like a man taking a final stand with little to lose before surrender . When he 's not providing a full-throated and many times banal defense of President Trump , he is often debating a fellow panelist discussing something he said on a previous evening . Even the hosts seem to be fed up . <p> Or , consider his previous labeling of President Trump as the " MLK of health care . " It was at once a hackneyed and insensitive comparison . But the comment had legs -- not just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ received -- but also by the numerous times it was covered in the following day -- on CNN ! <p> CNN 's bread and butter has always been covering big breaking news stories like elections , disasters or the occasional missing airplane . But lately , when they are not covering breaking news , CNN has turned almost exclusively into the very political panels that are souped-up versions of the original CNN debate show , Crossfire . <p> Lord seems by every measure like he 'd make a delightful guest at a dinner party . His convivial mien suits him well on these panel discussions , as frankly , he does n't seem to take himself too seriously . Not a class clown , but plays the role that seems written only to make the other characters appear smarter . And boy , does he do that . <p> The cable news patsy is not a new role . It 's just that some are better than others , and CNN 's problem is finding a smart , willing actor to play the part . Think of Alan Colmes when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much promise in his defense of Trump recently , that he upset the AC360 apple cart , in a most entertaining -- and less -- way . <p> Speaking of ... Mr. Lord is no longer a Trump surrogate who moderates and Democrats most love to vilify . For that , there needs to be some meat on the bones , an actual intellectual threat . Lord 's goofy defenses hardly fit the bill and CNN viewers can rightly expect more . . . even those who just want to love to hate . <p> This is an opinion piece . The views expressed in this article are those of just the author . 
 <h> Morning Joe Airs Bizarre Footage of Jeremy Corbyn 's Awkward Boob Slap <p> As the dust settles from the British elections last night , it seems increasingly clear that Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn was the contest 's big winner . His party picked up 31 seats , and broke Prime Minister Theresa May 's narrow Conservative majority . The election results will force May to create a coalition government with one of the minor parties if she is to remain Prime Minister . <p> But it was n't a perfect day for the often awkward Corbyn . When the Labour leader tried to give a high five to leftist MP Emily Thornberry , she moved away and he ended up just slapping her breast . -- It 's all on tape , and it 's as bad as it sounds . <p> The moment did n't go unnoticed by someone in Morning Joe 's control room . Though not mentioned on-air during a very sober discussion of the election with BBC 's Katty Kay , it did get a very prominent airing with some very bizarre and incongruent B-roll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and a " dementia tax , " viewers were treated to a clip of Corbyn 's awkward boob slap . And it did n't stop there . After playing the initial clip , Morning Joe played it again -- zoomed in and in slow motion . <p> ... And it did n't stop there either . The camera zoomed again , bringing viewers uncomfortably close to Ms. Thornberry breasts , and replayed the moment twice more . Out of context , it looked more like sexual assault . <p> The video then abruptly went back to Kay talking about that dementia tax . 
 <p> Lemon asked the former CBS anchor why Republicans are n't giving a ' full-throated " defense of the president . Rather answered , " Because I think they 're afraid where this may go . " <p> " They 're afraid that he may have indeed committed some impeachable offense , " he elaborated . " And also they 're hearing from home that a lot of their constituents are increasingly concerned with the Trump presidency . " <p> Rather then took aim at the Republican Party itself . <p> " Up until now , we have no profiles of courage among the Republicans , " he stated . " Someone speaking out saying ' Trump is bad and bad for the party . ' " <p> Rather is convinced that once President Trump 's poll numbers drop below 30% , you 'll see Republicans " go the other way . " 
 <p> Ivanka Trump appeared on Fox &amp; Friends this morning and provided a solid and dispassionate defense of many of the controversies and criticisms surrounding the presidency of her father . <p> Co-host Brian opened with a polite question about the James Comey hearing from last week , and Ms. Trump gave the predictable response that " my father felt very vindicated , " before continuing with " and all the statements that he has been making and feels incredibly optimistic . " She then pivoted to a topic that continued for the balance of the interview , saying " You know , at the White House and throughout the administration , we were incredibly focused on the reason we all went to Washington . " <p> Since the White House press staff have begun to defer all questions about the investigation into Russian election to President Trump 's legal team , the vacuum of surrogates willing to appear on Trump 's behalf has fallen to family members : Donald Trump Jr . appeared Saturday night with Judge Jeanine Pirro over the weekend and , now , Ivanka today @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with both the sort of softball questions and politically expedient bromides one might expect in such chummy confines . The one bit of interest came when the presidential daughter admitted that the level of meanness they 've felt inside the Beltway caught her off-guard . <p> Critics are sure to point out that President Trump 's demeanor towards his past and current political foes has not always been civil , though that is a topic for anther conversation . 
 <p> And while it 's a little early to be so angry , the outburst has certainly become par for the course , if not routine , for America 's mercurial 45th president . In the past he has accused members of our humble profession of fabricating lies , fake news ( of course ) and of being " enemies of the people . " <p> It 's not clear what specifically upset him this time , but his outbursts can often be traced to morning show coverage -- particularly Fox &amp; Friends -- which he is an avid fan of . <p> While a near cottage industry has risen up offering Trump unsolicited advice about tweeting , and there was even once a plan to have his lawyers vet what he puts into the ecosystem , that all appears to have gone by the wayside . 
 <p> Earlier this week , Newsmax CEO and close Trump ally Chris Ruddy set the news cycle on fire when he claimed that President Donald Trump was thinking about terminating special counselRobert Mueller . Ruddy 's remarks came on the heels of Trump loyalists growing louder with their calls that Mueller should be removed from heading up the Russia probe . <p> Behind the scenes , the president soon began entertaining the idea of firing Mr. Mueller even as his staff tried to discourage him from something they believed would turn a bad situation into a catastrophe , according to several people with direct knowledge of Mr. Trump 's interactions . <p> For now , the staff has prevailed . " While the president has every right to " fire Mr. Mueller , " he has no intention to do so , " the White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders told reporters late Tuesday after a day of speculation over Mr. Mueller 's fate . <p> The NYT noted that Trump has become increasingly angry over the thought that Mueller is part of a partisan " witch hunt " against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Even though it is reported that the president understands how risky firing Mueller will be , those close to him feel that Trump is " so volatile they can not be sure that he wo n't change his mind if he finds out anything to lead him to believe the investigation has been compromised . " 
 <p> As we began to learn more about James T. Hodgkinson Wednesday , the assailant in a shooting at a Congressional Baseball Practice in Alexandria , VA , one of the facts that has come out is that Hodgkinson is an avid Bernie Sanders supporter who appears to support many liberal causes . <p> He also supports at least one liberal host . <p> In one of a series of letters to the editor of the Belleville News-Democrat from 2012 , Hodgkinson praised MSNBC 's Rachel Maddow -- calling her program " one of my favorite TV shows . " <p> But Maddow reported on Wednesday night that the gunman did not attempt to get in touch with her . <p> " He once submitted a letter to the editor that cited statistics about political donations that he says he heard on this TV show because he said he watched this TV show , " Maddow said . " I should tell you we went through our correspondence today as soon as we got his name , as soon as we got that detail about him . We did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tried to contact us at all . " 
 <p> Near wall-to-wall coverage of yesterday 's congressional shooting was broken by a bombshell report from the Washington Post which revealed that Special Counsel Robert Mueller and his investigators were looking into whether Trump was guilty of obstruction of justice in the Russia probe . <p> The news did not go unnoticed by the Commander-in-Chief who -- as is style -- took to Twitter Thursday morning to blast the report as " phony " and accused investigators of pursing it only because they found " zero proof phony story . Nice <p> The move by special counsel Robert S. Mueller III to investigate Trump 's conduct marks a major turning point in the nearly year-old FBI investigation , which until recently focused on Russian meddling during the presidential campaign and on whether there was any coordination between the Trump campaign and the Kremlin . Investigators have also been looking for any evidence of possible financial crimes among Trump associates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the aisles have long said that Trump 's own erratic actions have often created his biggest problems . The Post took care to note that the investigation spread to Trump shortly after the president fired James Comey as FBI director . <p> In addition to the president , the New York reported that Trump associates were also being investigated for money laundering . 
 <p> A panel of doctors at the University of Cincinnati revealed on Thursday that former North Korean prisoner Otto Warmbier suffered severe damage to his brain while he was being held by the communist regime . <p> " His neurological condition can be best described as a state of unresponsive wakefulness , " Dr. Daniel Kanter said . <p> Dr. Kanter explained that " the most important diagnostic test thus far was a magnetic resonance imaging scan of the brain . This study showed extensive loss of brain tissue in all regions of the brain . " <p> The Ohio-based physician then outlined , " We have no certain or verifiable knowledge of the cause or circumstances of his neurological injury . This pattern of brain injury , however , is usually seen as a result of cardiopulmonary arrest , where the blood supply to the brain is inadequate for a period of time , resulting in the death of brain tissue . " <p> Dr. Kanter also revealed that the doctors caring for Warmbier " received copies of brain MRI images from the medical personnel in North Korea . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our analysis of those images , the brain injury likely occurred in the preceding weeks . " <p> When the American student was released in his comatose state on Tuesday , the North Korean regime explained that his condition was due to a case of botulism . Warmbier was subsequently given a sleeping pill , and he reportedly never woke up . <p> However , one of the physicians treating the former prisoner , Dr. Brandon Foreman , cast doubt on this claim . <p> " Botulism , as you know , is a toxin that causes nerve injury , " Dr. Foreman said . " As part of his evaluation with us , we performed electromyography and nerve conduction studies . Those tests did not reveal any evidence ... that would suggest active botulism at this time . " 
 <p> In the aftermath of the Congressional baseball shooting that has left House Majority Whip Steve Scalise in critical condition and others injured , veteran rocker and conservative firebrand Ted Nugent said he would no longer say anything that could be seen as inciting violence against political rivals . <p> Yes , that Ted Nugent . <p> Appearing on WABC Radio 's Curtis &amp; Eboni , the Motor City Madman said that he 's now been convinced that he ca n't speak in " harsh terms " anymore , citing his wife for showing him a better way . He also encouraged others to take on a more civil tone . <p> " I can not and I will not and I encourage even my friends/enemies on the left in the Democrat and liberal world that we got to be more civil to each other , " Nugent stated . " The whole world is watching America where you have the God-given right to life , liberty , and the pursuit of happiness . And we have to be more respectful to the other side . " <p> He added @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I 'm gon na back down . And if it gets fiery , if it gets hateful , I 'm going away and I 'm not gon na engage in that hateful rhetoric anymore . " <p> Nugent also addressed his past inflammatory comments about Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama , notably when he said they should suck on his machine gun , attributing them to rock and roll energy . <p> " I 'm not trying to make excuses , but when I made those wild ass comments on stage against then-Senator Hillary Clinton and then-Senator Barack Obama , I do n't know if you can grasp the degree of adrenaline and intensity and over-the-top animal spirit and attitude that I live on stage , " he said . Nugent added that he now has to take a " deep breath " and focus his energy on music . <p> " I will avoid anything that can be interpreted as condoning or referencing violence , " the Nuge noted . <p> He further explained that he never meant the machine gun remarks literally and that he does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " 
 <p> Kellyanne Conway appeared on Fox &amp; Friends Friday morning , and was quick to link media coverage of President Donald Trump to the shooting at a House GOP baseball practice that wounded Rep. Steve Scalise and four others . <p> Conway started by saying she looked back at TV coverage of Trump just before news broke of the shooting : <p> " I did a clever thing and I went back and looked at exactly what was being discussed on all the TV shows except yours at 7:09 a.m. on Wednesday when this happened , " she said . <p> " And it 's a really curious exercise because as Steve Scalise was fighting for his life and crawling into right field , in a trail of blood , you should go back and see what people were saying about the president and the Republicans at that very moment . " <p> After delivering those comments -- with the incendiary rhetoric dialed up to 11 -- Conway noted that since the tragedy there has been some " introspection , quieter more muted voices toning down the rhetoric . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , gearing back up . " If I were shot and killed tomorrow half of Twitter would explode in applause and excitement . " <p> " This is the world we live in now , " she added . <p> " It 's terrible . Because , again , it 's one thing to say I disagree with you on healthcare repeal , or on taxes , or on your plan for national security , but you ca n't attack people personally in a way , and think that tragedies like this wo n't happen . " 
 <p> Laura Loomer , who documented the entire ordeal via Periscope , stormed the stage and shouted " Stop the normalization of political violence ! " and accused the actors of " promoting violence against the right . " <p> She was quickly escorted off the stage by security and was arrested by the police . She was charged with trespassing and disorderly conduct , but was let go not long after . <p> When all of this went down , began trending on Twitter among Trump supporters . 
 <p> The way former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee sees it , this week 's Congressional baseball shooting is all a part of a wider trend of liberals trying to overthrow the government because they ca n't accept the results of last year 's presidential election . <p> " This is a bigger issue , " Huckabee said . " This is an attempt to overthrow the elected government . And I do n't want people to lose sight of the fact that what we 're seeing is not necessarily an organized attempt but a widespread attempt by people who hate the results of the election . Who want to overturn it not by another election , but by violent means . By any means possible ! " <p> The one-time Fox News host , whose daughter works for the Trump administration , went on to say that this is a much greater threat to America 's democracy than anything Russia has attempted to do . <p> " Forget the Russians , " he exclaimed . " Forget the fact that people are saying ' Oh the Russians tried to interfere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no evidence they changed one single vote . " <p> Huckabee went on to state that Americans need to be a lot more afraid of leftist radicals than the Russians , adding that they are committing " terrorism " against Trump supporters due to their bullying behavior. 
 <p> This morning , President Donald Trump once again started the day with some Twitter action . Spending the weekend with his family at Camp David , the president began Father 's Day by tossing out three tweets that touched on an outlier poll and his agenda in the face of the " Witch Hunt " Russia probe . <p> The MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN agenda is doing very well despite the distraction of the Witch Hunt . Many new jobs , high business enthusiasm , .. <p> One thing he did not mention during his early morning missives , however , was the tragic news that the seven missing sailors from the USS Fitzgerald were found dead last night in a flooded compartment . The bodies were found after the ship had returned to its base in Japan . <p> Trump had tweeted about the Fitzgerald and the then-missing sailors yesterday morning , offering up " thoughts and prayers " for them and their families . <p> Thoughts and prayers with the sailors of USS Fitzgerald and their families . Thank you to our Japanese allies for their assistance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no mention of anything via Twitter following the announcement of their deaths , even though it has been publicly known since last night and , as president , Trump had found out about the news before it was released . 
 <p> Speaking to this , Sen. Marco Rubio ( R-FL ) responded to State of the Union host Jake Tapper 's question about some Senate members ' concerns about Trump terminating Mueller . <p> " Well , first of all , that 's not going to happen , " Rubio noted . " I do n't believe it 's going to happen . And here 's what I would say . The best thing that could happen for the president , and the country , is a full and credible investigation . I really , truly believe that . " <p> Tapper then pointed out that he did n't think Trump would fire FBI Director James Comey until he went and did it . <p> " I do n't think we saw that coming , " Rubio stated . " But I do n't think that has in any way impeded the work of the FBI on these matters . " <p> The Florida lawmaker and former presidential candidate went on to say that he had no questions on Mueller 's integrity when it comes to his investigation . 
 <p> Hillary Briffa detailed the aftermath of the crash , which she watched from her window , before walking out to the scene . <p> " People were shouting that a car had collided with people who were exiting from Finsbury Park Mosque after prayer , " Briffa said . <p> " There was a lot of commotion , " Briffa continued . " There was a white van , and everyone was clamoring around it , and shouting at the man . " <p> " Police were pushing all of us back , " she said . <p> According to Briffa , people were shouting that the incident was an " act of Islamophobia , of white supremacy . " <p> " People were shouting ' this is an act of terror ' , " Briffa said , adding police were pushing people back so that they could cordon off the scene and help those injured . <p> Police have not disclosed whether the incident was an act of terror , or even if it was intentional . The incident comes just weeks after three attackers plowed a van @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Market , killing 8 and injuring dozens more . 
 <p> Fox 's Sean Hannity opened his Monday night show by taking a new swipe at MSNBC 's Joe Scarborough as he delivered a monologue against " leftist rage . " <p> Hannity began by connecting last week 's attack against the GOP Congressional baseball team to the " left-wing hatred " emblazoned by that production of Shakespeare 's " Julius Caesar " where Trump is depicted as the murdered Roman leader . Hannity acknowledged that Barack Obama was once depicted in the play the same way that Trump was , though the Fox host argued that the press would be up in arms and blame conservatives if this were the case in today 's media environment . <p> Hannity went on to smack " Liberal Joe " and others for criticizing him over his condemnation of the play . <p> " This is glorifying violence against the President of the United States of America , " Hannity stated . " This is n't even really about freedom of speech , although , I would never call for anybody to be silenced . These liberal purveyors of hate have the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a right to call them out for being beyond tasteless , vile , and disgusting . " <p> Hannity touched on several other recent examples of leftist rage , saying its all part of the plan by Trump critics to dehumanize the president . Hannity insisted he was n't trying to pin all the blame on Bernie Sanders for the baseball shooting , but there is an undeniable , " out-of-control rage and hatred " coming from the political left . 
 <p> The Fox News host called the interview " okay , " but acknowledged that it was " highly-edited " by the " Mainstream Leftwing Destroy Trump Media . " He then asked his audience whether they think networks " in this day and age " are obligated to release the full interviews on their websites . <p> " Whether you agree or disagree with Jones , this is the right thing to do . " <p> Hannity then made it clear he was not being critical of his former Fox News colleague by saying " she is a journalist , she was doing her job , " but still thought NBC should release the tapes . <p> " Let Americans decide , " he continued . " I 'm a little sick and tired of the mainstream media ... editing interviews to fit a predetermined narrative . Again , I 'm not saying that Megyn Kelly did this . As a matter of fact , I know she did n't . " <p> He added , " I really do hate to disappoint all of you people in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ break out between Megyn Kelly . That 's not happening . I truly wish her the best . " 
 <h> Sheriff Clarke Accuses Andrew Kaczynski of ' Electronic Terrorism ' <p> Conservative blog Media Equalizer has been running an extensive three-part series on Sheriff David Clarke 's response to CNN 's Andrew Kaczynski , whose reporting sunk Clarke 's would-be role at the Department of Homeland Security . <p> After reports surfaced that Clarke , an outspoken and controversial supporter of President Donald Trump would be taking a job at the DHS , CNN 's K-File team found that Clarke had plagiarized 47 parts of his 2013 master 's thesis with the Naval Postgraduate School . <p> The K-File sleuths previously sunk Monica Crowley 's would-be nomination for a communications post at the the National Security Council after they found the Fox News contributor had plagiarized large parts of her 2012 book What the ( Bleep ) Just Happened ? . <p> Since withdrawing from consideration for the post , Clarke has repeatedly derided Kaczynski as a " college dropout . " Speaking with Media Equalizer , Clarke said Kaczynski is " not accomplished , " a " hired gun , " a " defamation-of-character specialist , " and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Media Equalizer series itself goes to strange lengths in an attempt to smear Kaczynski , declaring him a partisan agent using " seemingly dishonest tactics " to target Republicans . Part Two of the write-up details Monica Crowley 's struggle with Kaczynski 's allegations , noting that her brother-in-law Alan Colmes had recently died of cancer and detailing her stress-induced weight loss -- " dropping to 100 pounds on an already-thin frame , " they write . <p> In a bizarre paragraph , Media Equalizer writes of Kaczynski : " in-between bachelor parties and menu choices , the two-time college drop-out and soon-to-be married man dropped another partisan bombshell when he reported that Sheriff David Clarke had allegedly plagiarized portions of his master 's thesis . " <p> " CNN 's sic wonderkind is just a kid . A rich one , perhaps , " the story writes . 
 <h> Senator Feinstein Defends Suppression of Conservative Speakers On College Campuses <p> On Tuesday , the day after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in favor of free speech in Matal v Tam , Democratic California Sen. Dianne Feinstein defended the University of California , Berkeley at a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing , and suggested that colleges should not have to guarantee the right for controversial figures to speak on campus . <p> In a back-and-forth debate with UCLA Law Professor Eugene Volokh over whether universities had a responsibility to handle security for controversial speakers , Feinstein seemed to suggest that universities should not be obligated to accommodate speakers if they do n't have the resources and believe the individual 's presence could spark violence . <p> " One of the problems that I have is that there is an expectation that the university handles it , " Feinstein said . " The handling of it , means that you have resources to be able to send and those resources know what to do . And particularly for the public university , and particularly for the University of California , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So the resources are not always what they might be , " she added . <p> Volokh contested that , in the case of public universities , local police forces should join campus authorities to maintain order . <p> " I would think that Berkeley police department would also be able and should be willing to lend police officers to help out , " Volokh said . " If we are in a position where our police departments are unable to protect free speech , whether it 's universities or otherwise , then yes , indeed , we are in a very bad position , " he added . <p> Feinstein then pressed Volokh over whether the university should be obligated to protect any speaker , regardless of the level of controversy and potential backlash they pose . <p> " Professor , let me just understand what you are saying . No matter who comes , no matter what disturbance , the university has to be prepared to handle it ? It 's the problem for the university ? That 's the argument you are making ? You are making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problem should never be refused ? " she asked . <p> After acknowledging that there could be possible exceptions , Volokh suggested that the government does have an obligation to protect the First Amendment rights of its citizens . <p> " It 's not just the university it 's the government . It 's the job of the government . I am not the big believer of large jobs for the government , but one important job of the government is to prevent violence and to prevent violence without suppressing free speech , " he contended . 
 <p> Fox News contributor Charles Krauthammer appeared on Tucker Carlson Tonight on Thursday to discuss the recent Congressional special election losses by the Democrats . <p> Krauthammer explained how the party essentially has two separate factions , the Bernie Sanders wing , which he calls the base , and the Hillary Clinton wing , which he calls the majority . <p> And Krauthammer believes that the majority does not have a coherent message . And in the absence of a coherent message , Krauthammer believes the Clinton wing of the party tries to appeal to various constituencies . <p> " They appeal to Blacks , to Hispanics , to young people , to mostly women , but it 's mostly single women , to LGBT ... It 's a stitching together of constituencies . <p> " So when you say , ' what do you stand for ? ' , they ca n't give an answer . So , what do they do ? They invent this idea of diversity . " <p> Krauthammer went on to say that he does n't believe this to be a worthwhile strategy for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said . " It 's an intellectual excuse for appealing to one constituency at a time . And that 's not a way for a party to survive . " 
 <p> With White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer holding fewer on-camera press briefings in recent weeks , CNN 's Jim Acosta went off on Spicer and the White House press shop , calling the press secretary " kind of useless " while wondering aloud why are they even having briefings and gaggles in the first place . <p> In an interview with Fox News ' Howard Kurtz that aired today on MediaBuzz , Spicer took some shots at Acosta and other reporters for complaining about the lack of briefings aired on television . After defending the press shop 's practices revolving around briefings and gaggles , the spokesperson addressed Acosta 's criticisms . <p> " It 's sad that he believes if it does n't occur on TV -- I think some of these reporters are more interested in their YouTube clips than they are in getting factual news , " Spicer noted <p> He continued , " You look at the number of questions asked over and over again just so the reporter can get a clip of themselves saying something or yelling at someone . " <p> Spicer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good to have a " mix " of on-camera briefings with off-camera gaggles . <p> " To suggest that if it 's not on television is somewhat nonsensical , " he told Kurtz . " We engage with the press corps very robustly from early in the morning to late at night . The briefing is one small part of what this staff does . " 
 <p> The July 4th holiday is a famously slow news cycle . From the hallowed halls of the New York Times , to the lowest clickbait farm , news organizations struggle to string together a mix of pre-planned programming and gimmicks to get through the desert . <p> To that end , the always clever NPR decided to tweet the Declaration of Independence -- the entire Declaration of Independence -- to mark the holiday . <p> Quite frankly , it would be hard to think of something less controversial to do . <p> Incredibly , the Trumpian on Twitter , looking for liberal bias around every corner , took exception to some of Jefferson of a free people . 
 <p> Therefore , it should n't be too surprising that when White House counselor Kellyanne Conway appeared on MediaBuzz for an interview , the conversation immediately steered to CNN . <p> Asked by host Howard Kurtz about the " hand-wringing " from the press when Trump attacked CNN and NBC while in Poland last week , Conway stated that Trump just wants to be treated fairly by the press . She added that " the media spends too much time talking about themselves and covering the issues they want the American public to focus on . " <p> Kurtz then noted that CNN 's Jim Trump 's presser in Poland when he called upon a friendly reporter , calling it a " fake news conference . " Conway responded by highlighting the issues the network has been forced to deal with lately . <p> " That 's unfair , " she exclaimed . " CNN has had a very bad couple of weeks . By any objective standard that would be true . " 
 <p> Much of the discussion revolving around Donald Trump Jr 's previously undisclosed meeting with a Russian lawyer has been based on whether this is evidence of collusion between the Russian government and the Trump campaign . In that vein , CNN 's Michael Smerconish asked this question -- what if this was all an attempt by the Russians to put Trump Jr . and others involved in the meeting a compromising situation ? <p> During today 's broadcast of Smerconish , the host presented his theory that the Russian government wanted to gather compromising information , or kompromat , on Trump Jr . based on the way the June 2016 meeting was arranged . Recapping the email chain between Rob Goldstone and Trump Jr . that showed the meeting with a Russian attorney was to gather damaging info on Hillary Clinton from the Russian government because it supported Trump , Smerconish posited that Russian intelligence may have been looking to grab evidence to use later as blackmail against the Trump campaign . <p> " It 's almost too clean , " he stated . " Written evidence suggestive , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ someone named Donald Trump . And it all begs this thought , could the meeting itself have been a form of compromise ? Was Trump Jr . duped ? " <p> He continued , " By taking the meeting he exposed himself , he exposed Paul Manafort and Jared Kushner to Russian leverage . The meeting should never have taken place . The Americans involved might not have known that , but the Russians surely did . Was the real purpose to document evidence of wrongful conduct and then put it in a file on each of these three Americans ? " <p> Smerconish then went on to discuss his theory with professor Keith Darden , with the two also bringing up the infamous Steele dossier. 
 <p> In a video that has gone viral , a woman at a Los Angeles art exhibit can be seen knocking over a row of pillars , causing hundreds of thousands of dollars of damage , according to the artist . <p> The exhibit , by Hong Kong-based multimedia artist Simon Birch , featured rows of pillars with crowns carefully placed on top . The crowns were 3D printed and made of a variety of materials , such nylon , brass , granite , and marble . <p> While viewing the exhibit , the young woman squatted in front of one row of pillars to take a selfie . She ended up losing her balance and fell back into the front post . This triggered a domino effect and 16 pillars toppled over , with all of the crowns falling off . <p> Birch told the New York Timesthat the ill-fated selfie caused $200,000 worth of damage . In a Facebook post , Birch explained that each crown is valued at $20,000 and that most of the ones damaged were fixed , but some might be permanently damaged <p> He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have the funds to sue the woman for the damage she caused . Additionally , the crowns were not insured because they could not afford it . 
 <p> On Fox News Sunday this morning , Chris Wallace repeatedly grilled Jay Sekulow over whether the past denials of Russian contact by people on the Trump Team now look " suspect . " <p> Sekulow , a member of President Trump 's legal team , did the Full Ginsburg on the Sunday shows this morning , and his Fox interview started with Wallace playing clips of Donald Trump Jr. , the President himself , and Vice President Mike Pence insisting there were no Russian contacts . <p> Wallace asked , " Do you now acknowledge that all of those denials are at the very least suspect ? " <p> Sekulow was quick to bring up James Comey , which led Wallace to interject , " This does n't have anything to do with my question . " <p> When Sekulow said he would answer the question , Wallace replied , " It depends how long we 're gon na take to get there . " <p> Sekulow brought up Comey 's actions -- -- leaking his memos to help create a special counsel -- -- but again Wallace said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that . " <p> They continued going back and forth over whether the Don Jr . meeting itself was improper , with Wallace confronting Sekulow on whether it showed " intent and willingness " to collude. 
 <p> Asked why he thought the report had been leaked illegally , Mr. Scaramucci responded by text : " They are n't in process yet . " But when told his form could be released on July 23 , he did not respond further . <p> It is unclear whether or not Scaramucci initially thought that Priebus leaked his financial disclosure not knowing it was already been made public or if he was simply trolling Twitter and warning potential leakers in the process . 
 <h> Scaramucci 's Wife Filed for Divorce At the End of Her Pregnancy ; Gave Birth While He Attended Trump Speech <p> It would appear that not even the imminent birth of their child was enough to save the marriage between Anthony Scaramucci and Deidre Ball . <p> Earlier this week , reports emerged about how the White House Communications Director 's wife was filing for divorce . Today , New York Post expanded on their initial reporting by noting that Bell filed for divorce three weeks ago , after she was pregnant for almost nine months . <p> Page Six says that while Scaramucci was in West Virginia on Monday for President Trump 's speech with the Boy Scouts , Bell was in a New York hospital giving birth to the couple 's son .
