Thanks , and I hope you enjoy this one ! = <p> I love trying new things , thanks for the curling information I will definitely check it out . Life is about experiences , right ? ! And my mouth just experienced intense personal growth with this Thai peanut wrap , LOVE IT ! Pinned ! ! <p> Life is indeed all about the different experiences , Tonya @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? And who would have thought that a lazy bloodhound would go run a half-marathon ? = Thanks so much for pinning ! <p> There 's a place near where I work that makes salads , and you can get any of the salads as a wrap . I eat there all the time . This sandwich reminds me of that , although I 'm not sure they have anything with a peanut sauce . Ill have to clue them in . You 'll need to get royalties , of course . <p> Well , obviously . Instead of you going there to get a sandwich for lunch today , you should take them this wrap instead . Kindof a reverse lunch order type of thing . I 'd be curious to see how they react to that one ! <p> Oooh , I heard about Ludivine hey , if he could run a half duuude I think you could too just put Robbie in a jogging stroller that 's what I used to do with Lil Shashi but , TBH , I did n't  ever run a half pushing her though . Speaking of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw what I did there = this past week and I know for a fact she would be blown away by this am sending her the link ! <p> Hahahahave you ever seen me run , Shashi ? Running half way down the block is a pretty big accomplishment for me . I 'll get on an elliptical for an hour or I can go curl for 2+ hoursbut running ? No thanks . Although if Ludivine was running alongside me , I might be able to go for an entire block . You should totally get lil Shashi to make these wraps ! Shed roll over at the taste . Hah . <p> Hi David ! These wraps sound fantastic , even if they are healthy ! I would leave out the edamame I have tried and tried to like it , but it just does n't  do anything for me . <p> Hi David !

I wish you had n't  told me that , Jeff . I totally had a nice , relaxing day plannedbut now I will be driving to Chicago to get some of these aforementioned doughnuts . Also , St. Martin , too ? Can I go to St. Martin and eat doughnuts stuffed with cookie butter ? That sounds like a pretty awesome vacation to me ! <p> That 's good that you travel to Canada too . This means you can drop a food parcel some day ( read you do n't  need to spend your money on postal expenses . Thus , you could stuff the box with more foodies ) .

Last one was Turkey , three years ago and we traveled 2,300 miles cruising all over from Istanbul to Troy and down to Ephesus and up to Ankara . Beautiful people , country and the food ? Wow , I never had so many different grilled meals , lentil soups and THE best flavored tomatoes of all time . India is fast approaching in March , ca n't wait !

I hope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) do ! = In fact , I just had some smoked ham out of this smokerand it turned out amazing ! Happy Holidays ! <p> Hey , wake up and smell the present day . Single women have " women caves " and remote controls too ! I bought one of these too and I totally love it ! ! ! ! ! As a gadget girl I love remote controls , robotics and the latest in technology , especially fun things and toys . I even own a remote control pool skimmer that looks like a boat , fire place insert with remote control , fake flames and real heat , you name it . Now I 'm happy to say I own a Masterbuilt digital remote control smoker on my porch that has already smoked two briskets , turkey , beer chicken , ribs and now jerky and its only been three weekends . My co-workers love my new smoker too because they get to taste test for me . <p> I agree with you 100% , Michele ! My wife absolutely loves using the digital smoker , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Sometimes I get a bit confused about which remote goes to which gadgetbut that 's a good problem to have , right ? Sounds like you 've been smoking away the past couple of weekends . Its still a bit cold up here in upstate New York , but I plan to get the smoker going again in another couple of weeks here . Thanks for stopping by and sharing ! ! <p> I 'm using our Masterbuilt smoker today to make beef jerky . I started with a five lb. eye of round roast with absolutely no fat on it . I used a super sharp filet knife to cut it into about 1/4 " slices and marinated it overnight in Allegro liquid marinade . I 'll sprinkle the slices lightly with a mixture of coarsely ground black pepper and garlic powder prior to putting in in the smoker . I do n't  have hickory chips , so I 'm using Applewood I hope the results are good . However , I usually only use Applewood for pork . <p> BTW : I am female , and I know my way around grills @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My four teenage Grandchildren anxiously await trying this jerky , as I 've made lots of jerky , just never in an electric smoker . Suggestions ? ? ? <p> Hey Nonnie ! Thanks so much for stopping byand I 'm totally jealous that you have a batch of this jerky going today . = Makes me want to get out there and get a batch started myself ! It sounds like you have a pretty good start so far . ( I agree that I also use applewood with pork , but I do n't  think it will make that big of a difference ! ) My best recommendation is just to keep an eye on the soaked wood chipsyou will likely have to pull the tray out and add more several times throughout the process . ( And be careful when you dothat tray gets hot ! ) I really hope the jerky turns out tasty for you ! ! Let me know what you think ! <p> I asked Frank , the mgr at my local HEB , the same thing when I bought a 3.3 lb. top round @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they could n't slice it thin enough . I have an electric slicer so I 'm doing the job myself . Always had the butcher do it before but I was n't going to argue with him on this point . <p> Ya I got a master built smoker and its about the coolest thing Ive ever owned . I got mine on special form the qvc channel and used it the day it arrived . I believe all relationships begin as they mean to go on so the first thing I made was ribs and chicken wings . The ribs were the best Ive ever made so I was quite pleased . The smoker itself it simple to assemble and use I only wish the wood tray was a little bigger but at least its easy to fill . So in summery get this smoker it RULES ! <p> Thanks for commenting , Alex ! I also love this smoker . Its so easy to pull out and get a batch of awesome ribs going . And now Im inspired by your wingsIll have to smoke a batch of chicken wings soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small , but I usually just keep an eye on it and refill it a couple of times with soaked wood throughout . Have a great day ! <p> I have made large batch smoked beef jerky at the restaurant . I 'd like to try it at home on my MES . However , Im concerned it wont produce smoke at 150 or below . ( temp Ive always done it at ) How do you over come this ? Tips tricks would be welcome , thanks ! <p> Hey Lesa ! Great question about smoking temp . I 've never made this beef jerky at 150- ( I typically go around 180- ) , so I do n't  have any personal experiences here . However , as long as your wood is soaked well ( and then drained , of course ) you should be ok . I know at 180- , I have to add more wood chips occasionallyso I would think they would at least smoke well at 150-F . When in doubt , just give it a shot ! You could always bump up the temperature just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at 150- . I hope this helps ! If you do end up making it , come back and let me knowIm always game for learning a new trick or two . = <p> To combat the problem of smoking at or below 180 - f , I purchased an awesome little attachment called the masterbuilt cold smoking kit . It attaches dirrectly to the existing wood chip hole on any size or style of masterbuilt electric smoker , and will allow you to produce tons of smoke at Temps of 100- f and below .. I initially bought this to do smoked cheeses ( which are awesome ) , but quickly discovered that it was far more convenient even at higher temps , as you only need to add wood every 3-4 hours . I got mine at cabellas for $60 on sale . <p> Interesting ! I have n't heard about the Masterbuilt Cold Smoking Kitbut now I totally want to get one . I 'd love to make smoked cheese . I wonder if you could use that to make cold-smoked salmon , too ? Thanks for the heads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tricky part is the brine and cure process that goes on before the smoke itself ( assuming you are going for lox style ) . This can take up to 14 days . I have done it , and the results are awesome , and about 25% the cost of store bought . Due to the time investment , I usually do this in large ( ish ) batches around the holidays for when family arrives . <p> Awesome ! At one point , I went and read up on cold smoking , but then I guess I just got distracted and never got back around to it . Now youve totally inspired me to give it a shot ! And thanks for the correction there14 days sounded like a really long time . haha ! <p> Awesome ! Congrats on getting this awesome smoker for Christmas ! Beef jerky is definitely one of my favorite things to make with it . A friend just used his Masterbuilt for smoking a ham ( He used a pre-cooked ham , but then he smoked it for flavor ) , and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Happy Holidays ! ! <p> we bought our Masterbuilt smoker in August of this year . We have smoked ribs , chicken , turkey , prime rib , and an eager to try the beef jerky . I cant wait to do a pulled pork after reading recipes.we have a large smoker we tow behind the truck for big events but this is perfect for the backyard and wonderful wonderful flavor.I also bought John La mores cookbook and recommend that to everyone who owns a Masterbuilt smoker or who BBQs a lot . <p> Pulled pork is one of my go-to smoking recipes , Daunita ! It freezes well , too , so we always keep a bunch in the freezer packed in enough for 1-2 night servings . Nothing beats enjoying a pulled pork sandwich on a cold winter nightit almost makes it feel like summer ! = Thanks so much for stopping by my siteI really appreciate it !

I hope you enjoy the smoker as much as we doits pretty awesome ! Thanks so much for stopping by my siteI really appreciate it ! Have a great rest of the holidays and a Happy New Year ! <p> Btw Turkey jerky is a go to this time of year . When the turkeys drop to 50 or 60 cents a lb , I buy something like 9 or 10 and break them down . I use the thighs for gumbo , but the rest gets smoked . The breast get used for jerky and the legs gets turned into super bowl party smoked turkey legs ( putting 15-20 smoked turkey legs on the table really goes over well ) . <p> Now that is an awesome idea ! Pretty soon here , turkeys will be crazy cheapbut Ive never thought about making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gumbo , but turkey would totally work , too . And the legs ? That is perfect for the Super Bowl ! Thanks for the ideas and suggestionsI hope your holidays are going well ! = <p> I purchased my smoker a month ago and I love it .

I have deer jerky in it right now . <p> I just had a friend use the smoker for Christmas ham , too , Cheryl ! He brought me over a little bit to taste , and it was amazing . I 'm definitely planning on picking up a ham when they go on sale after the holidayssmoked ham sandwiches sounds like a delicious lunch for mid-January , right ? = Thank you so much for stopping by and for commenting , tooI really appreciate it !

It is so cool that you can make beef jerky to eat at any time . However , I do n't  have that smoker , so I cant make beef jerky myself . Ill just have to find some really good jerky that I can buy ! <p> Hey Brian ! So glad you liked this recipeit is indeed delicious , and your comment reminds me that I should make some more soon . You do not need to refrigeration the jerky , but if you plan on keeping it around more than 2 weeks , then you should store it in the freezer . Enjoy ! <p> Bought my MES 40 ? ( 1st gen ) last week and currently have the sirloin strips marinating in your recipe ( although swapped coke for Dr Pepper and added an extra spoon of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the smoker tomorrow morning and even more looking forward to eating them ! <p> Dr Pepper would be a tasty switch there , Matt !

I hope the jerky turns out great for you today ! = <p> Hey Jerry ! I often use mesquite smoked wood chips , but this is totally a personal choice . Cherry and apple wood are both great options as well . Play around with different ones to see which flavor you like the most . And I hope you enjoy the jerky ! <p> Smoked like a charm .. i use pellets and chips .. becareful with chips not too many at a time .. last weekend i smoked 4 5lb whole chickens and 8 sausages no issue at one time .. u can easily do 3-4 racks of ribs .. cutting is required if u cut them into 5-6 bone length u can get 2-3 per rack .. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Awesome !

Have a great dayand happy smoking ! = <p> I was actually just looking at that book on Amazon a few days ago and was thinking of getting it as I have a Masterbuilt myself . Beef jerky is actually one thing that I 've never made with the smoker because I 'm the only beef eater in the house this looks like a pretty good recipe , might end up investing in that book yet . <p> Its a good book for sure , John ! Its kinda fun to make your own beef jerky , too . And the good news is it lasts a whileso that means more snacks for you , right ? = Thanks so much for leaving a comment ! Happy smoking ! <p> I also am a woman smoker . My husband purchased my Masterbuilt 30 inch Smoker . I have made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love it My next project is smoking salmon . My friends think it is complicated but it is so easy just start it and relax .

Smoking salmon is indeed much easier than people thinkand its so impressive to make . My wife has been begging me to make smoked salmon , so maybe I 'll have to get some going soon . Thanks so much for your comment , Andrea ! <p> Hey Jim ! That 's a really great question . I 've never made ground meat jerky , but I have read about it online before . Unfortunately , I cant answer your question though since Ive never used this smoker for anything but regular jerky . I did a quick Google search , and found this : LONG ... <p> It looks like that recipe uses a dehydrator at 145-150-F for 12-18 hours . This smoker does go all the way down to 100- , so it could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a shot with a test batch ? If you do , come back and let me know . Now I 'm curious about trying out a batch of ground jerky myself ! Thanks ! ! <p> Hey , Scott ! You know , I think my friend might have the same Masterbuilt smoker as you as his does n't  have the window either . We were actually down visiting him for Thanksgiving , and he made a smoked turkey breast . Woah ! That was delicious . But wrapping it in bacon sounds even more impressive . I bet that was one heck of a Thanksgiving meal ! I hope the jerky turned out well yesterday , and thanks so much for leaving a comment ! <p> I just purchased my first , only and last smoker , the masterbuilt signature series . I as well as my family and friends are highly impressed . I can not get enough of this beautiful tool .. Thank you to my mom and dad for the best birthday gift ever . <p> Hey Mike ! I 'm glad you got this smokerand it sounds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We just smoked some salmon and ham last weekdelicious ! Happy smoking , my friend ! And thanks so much for leaving a comment here . = <p> Why thank you very much , Ted ! I often keep several different kinds of wood chips around . My favorites are the fruity ones ( like cherry or apple ) , but mesquite is right up there , too . It just depends on my mood that day ! = <h> Trackbacks <p> than 30 lbs . of meat at the same time , so that means you 've got plenty of room for chicken , ribs , beef jerky and more . Another advantage of the smoker is it does n't use a lot of wood as it is powered by 146880 @qwx346880 <p> Comment 146879 @qwx346879 <p> Name * <p> Email * <p> Website 146875 @qwx346875 146874 @qwx346874 146877 @qwx346877

Thank you ! <p> Hi David . I do n't  care what you call thesepecans and coconut AND cream cheese frosting , yes . I assume you used unsweetened coconut flakes ( which I just happened to buy last week ) . Also , from the ingredient amounts I assume this makes twelve cupcakes . I see these in my immediate future . <p> Hey there , Dorothy ! I did indeed use unsweetened coconut flakes for these cupcakes . I feel like the unsweetened version just have so much more coconut flavor . And , yes , I 'm really bad about putting yields in my recipesIm usually good about it for things like cupcakes , but I dropped the ball this time . But hey , when you 've got cupcakes this tasty staring you in the face , you tend to forget a lot of things ! ( That 's my excuse , and I 'm sticking to it . haha ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hope you guys are avoiding some of that nasty weather I 'm seeing on the news for the south right now . <p> YUM . Diggin the buttermilk in there and that cream cheese frosting buddy . I 'd take a few off your hands no problemo . A few years ago Dave and I went and did a Rhine river cruise . Majestic castle scenery and its amazing all the wineries and vineyards along the river . Beautiful . I highly recommend if you can ( even for 1 day ) to hit up Prague . So many movies have been filmed there . Still one of the most gorgeous cities ever . Hitler loved it so it was never bombed , just pristine and amazing . Every time I see this INXS video it reminds me of it . https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=AIBv2GEnXlc . Enjoy ! <p> Ah , so you 've been over to the Rhine ! I cant wait for that trip ! Unfortunately , Prague is n't on the agenda this yearwe chose to stay in Amsterdam for a couple of nights before the cruise leaves . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well try to get there soon ! And wow , you 're reaching backINXS ! Love it ! Do n't  think Ive ever actually seen this video now , but its a good one . Thanks , Kevin ! <p> Stop it right now David ! What are you doing to me ? Are these cupcakes diet approved ? Ok Ok I 'll just have one . I can tell they are worth it = I ca n't wait to visit Charleston sometime soon the food scene is out of this world . I did n't realize Italian Cream Cake was n't at all Italian , tricky tricky , tricky . Have a great weekend my friend <p> Hahahathese cupcakes are sadly not diet approved . Although you can totally still eat them on a dietits just all about portion control ! ( Yes , that is easier said than done , but still . ) Charleston has indeed turned into a huge foodie place , and its a wonderful city to visit ! ( Let me know before you go , and I 'll give you some tips . ) I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a kidbut then again , I was a kid and my idea of gourmet food was mac and cheese . ( Oh , who am I kidding ?

Hope you and your little guy are doing well , my friend ! = <p> Yeah , some names are completely weird , David ! As you may remember , I always say a coffee cake that does n't  have coffee inside shouldnt really be named a coffee cake ! Or let 's say a tea cake which guess what does n't  include any tea either . This story about creating the Italian Cream Cupcakes really is a mistery . I do believe not all facts have being revealed , and you need to investigate it ! Apart of history , these cupcakes sound amazing ! And although I love mascarpone , I like this recipe calls for cream cheese cause its not that overly decadent like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Coffee cake is one of those weird ones , too . I think it got its name since its supposed to be served with coffeebut who the heck knows ! Yes , I have no idea about the " Italian " origins of this cake , but I do know that these cupcakes are mighty delicious . I wonder if you could use mascarpone and make these cupcakes a bit more Italian ? Hmmmthings to try sometime when I get bored , right ? = Thanks , my friend ! <p> I know ! These cupcakes will shake your beliefs about Italian food all the way down to the core . But , hey , who cares about the nametheyre still delicious ! ( And , yes , I 'm ok with Pizza Hut as long as Niki does n't  call it Italian food . Haha ! ) <p> Ha ! Maybe they should be called Italian-American cupcakes . Like our " Chinese food " is really Chinese-American food chop suey was invented in this country during the gold rush according to a documentary I watched . And we all know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ == Italy . <p> I did not realize that chop suey is an American inventioninteresting !

Thanks so much , SueAnn ! <p> I wish I had loads of suggestions for yall on yalls escapade coming up but I 've never been to Germany . One of my professors currently had a cousin who lived in Germany prior to the wall coming down and he has been sharing all sorts of stories with us though , he has n't  shared anything about notable food joints gosh , am in awe , all I ever think of is where to eat ! And I remember those shrimp boats the last time Lil S and I were down in Charleston think we were on a dock somewhere waiting on a boat ride and we saw one pull up and people coming with their buckets to get their fresh shrimp ! Speaking of Charleston guess where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your research on the orgin of food names I got ta admit , I have n't though much about it and I bet , you put one of these cupcakes in front of me and all I 'll be thinking about is hmmm would it be rude to ask for another ? <p> Hahaall I ever think about is food , too , Shashi ! That 's why were such good friends ! = So I bet that would have been interesting to see Germany before and then after the wall coming down . But I 'm still super excited about the trip ! Robbie wont be there with us ( hell be with Grandma ) , so I know well miss the little guybut I 'm still ready to get away for a bit here . <p> Waityoure going to Charleston this week ?

First of all , thank you so much for trying out this recipe and coming back to let me know how it turned out . Its one of our favorites , and I 'm glad you enjoyed it , too !

It sounds similar in that you add in **25;151;TOOLONG and it calculates how much you have left in the day .

So I do n't  typically calculate calories in my recipes as I find the calorie counters out there just are n't  very reliable . ( They vary quite a bit depending on which one you usewhich is pretty surprising . ) But in general this recipe is healthy since it just uses grilled chicken . You do have to keep an eye on how much pasta you serve it with , though . And the pesto is a bit calorie-intense , too , but you do n't  need that much pesto when it toss it with the pasta before serving . A little bit goes a long way !

Let chicken rest for 5 minutes and then slice into strips . <p> For the Sesame Dressing <p> Using a medium bowl ( or a jar with a tight-fitting lid ) , add all ingredients ; whisk together until well combined . <p> Store any leftover dressing in an air-tight container in the refrigerator for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to recombine . <p> For the Wraps <p> Using a large bowl , combine all of the ingredients ( including cooked chicken ) except for the wraps ; mix until well combined .

Roll up flatbreads ; cut in half before serving . <p> Hahahaha ! Robbie is nobodys fool ! I 'd take back all my mandarin oranges too : ) . Those little wedges of heaven add so much flavor to everything . But tell him thank you for the loan so we could all see this awesome recipe . I usually just have yogurt for lunch but I aspire to eat real food someday . . . this is a great place to start . Have a great Thursday , David ! <p> Haha ! Yeah , I tried to steal Robbies food to make a recipe , and he let me know that was n't cool at all . Plus , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ !

I agree that its ok to have recipes during snow days that take a little longer to make . Why not , right ? Its fun to make up something and you probably burned a bunch of calories shoveling so you deserve something good , right = I bet Robbie will keep a closer eye on those mandarin oranges next time , though , lol = <p> Yes ! Those canned mandarin oranges are now a staple in our pantry thanks to Robbie . He loves them ! So I decided to steal ( ahem , borrow apparently ) some of them to make these wraps . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keen on what I 'm up to these daysand he let 's me know if he does n't  approve . Hah ! Thanks , Dawn ! <p> Why thank you very much , Mara ! We seriously do love Flatout flatbreads around here . Were always making wraps for lunch or dinner ! This time I " borrowed " some of Robbies mandarins , and they made for a fun addition . And , yes , the chow mein noodles bring a nice crunch , although you cant add those in advance since they lose their crunch . Hope you had a great weekend , my Michigan friend ! <p> Well , Robbie might have gone in and stolen all of his mandarins back from this wrap filling . Haha ! But these wraps are indeed a fun way to mix up weekday lunches . Plus , you can make the filling ahead of time , so lunches are nice and easy for the week ! Thanks so much , Dawn ! <p> Ok David I 'm going to let you in on a little secret . I hate wraps . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I do n't really know why but I absolutely despise them . Yay Laura is working from home ! No rules = I would devour this Asian chicken wrap without the wrap . Mandarin oranges are delicious . Oh wait I just realized there was a blizzard a couple of months ago , lol <p> Seriously ? You hate wraps ? ? What did wraps ever do to you ? ? Haha ! You could totally deconstruct this one and eat it in non-wrap form . Robbie did n't  mind too much that I stole his mandarinswell , that 's not true . He went and stole all of his mandarins back from the bowl after I shot these photos . Haha ! Thanks , Mary ! Hope you had a great weekend , my friend ! <p> HahaI totally hear ya about the freezer space , Neil ! I swear its like playing a game of Tetris whenever we go into our freezer . I try my hardest to get something out , and then 2 more things show up to take its place . = <p> These wraps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tasty ! The mandarin oranges provide a fun , sweet additioneven though Robbie went through and took all of his mandarins back afterwards . Haha ! I hope you guys had a great weekend , my friend ! <p> It really is an easy wrap filling to mix up , and it makes for great weekday lunches ! The wrap form just makes it much easier to pack and eat . = Thanks , Kathy ! I hope you had a great Mothers Day weekend , my friend ! <p> Haha Dude now that Robbie is apparently keeping an eye on his stash of canned orange slices , yall are in trouble ! He might start using it in some sort of barter system say like 2 oranges slices for two wraps with chicken and chow mein noodles ? = On a serious note though you come up with some fantastic wrap ideas ! This is just too fun loving all the flavors and good tip regarding storing the filling and the dressing separately I can not tell you how many times Ive forgotten that step and ended up with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a wonderful weekend ! <p> Haha ! Do n't  give the little guy any ideas , Shashi . He s already getting into enough trouble on his own ! ( The latest stunt is asking us to wipe his nose nonstop because we started letting him walk over and throw away the tissues on his ownand now he loves doing it ! ) <p> Thank you so much for the kind words about the wraps . These are super easy and super tasty . And Robbies mandarins added a nice little sweetnessat least until he went through and stole them all back ! = Thanks , my friend , and I hope you had an awesome Mothers Day weekend ! ! <p> Ooooyoure totally right , Bethany ! These would be great for a summer picnic .

Boxed wines are totally legit , and they really are perfect for taking along on all sorts of summer activities . = Thanks , Kathy ! <p> Hi David . I 'm always on the lookout for new appetizer recipes . This one sounds great .

I cant decide if I 'm the only person who actually lives on my street or if everyone just stays inside during summer months and I 'm the only person crazy enough to venture out when its 115 degrees . ( I 'm leaning toward the latter . ) Maybe we have an equivalent to your Thursday Troubadours in the fall . If not I 'll start one ! And bring these awesome bites of goat cheese-y goodness ! <p> I 'm thinking there are indeed other people living on your street .

Troubadours sounds like a lot of fun . I love events that move from house to house around the neighborhood . That sounds like so much fun .

Perfect for sharing with friends ! Thanks , Mary ! ! <p> Troubadour parties ? How cool is that ( Although I 'm not a huge fan of mingling with my neighbors hah . ) You know what 's one huge difference between a neighborhood in the U.S. and Canada ? Here in Canada , while still being polite and nice , we barely know our neighbors . I 'm serious . I 'm not even talking about knowing/remembering their names -recognizing their faces can be challenging too . And gathering on weekends ? Well , there 's a tradition to have a barbecue picnic once in a year . Never visited though : ) But , David , I promise if you invite me ( and most importantly guarantee a lot of delicious food including these peppers ) , I will definitely show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have different vibes . When we lived in Atlanta , we only knew our next door neighbor and then our across-the-street neighbors . And we rarely ever hung out together . But then up here in New York , our neighbors already had the Thursday Troubadours thing goingso that was a nice way to meet everyone . So I say you should go to the yearly picnic this year ! I bet you 'll impress everyone with some amazing salad . = Seriously , though , do it ! Appetizer parties are so much fun ! <p> ive never seen these before ! maybe because i 'm preoccupied with the olives ( i love olives ) . this sounds like such an easy , satisfying ( i 'm convinced that anything with cheese is a great app ) appetizer/snack ( : <p> Oh , I love olives , too , Heatherand I could easily get preoccupied with olives . In fact , I 've been wanting to try stuffing my own olives . Maybe some day . We were on vacation recently , and we saw a bunch of olive treesand that made me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just looked at me and rolled her eyes . Haha ! Appetizers really are the best , are n't  they ? = <p> Thursday Night Troubadours sounds like its brilliant fun David . A couple of glasses of wine on a Thursday night and these excellent stuffed piquante peppers is surely a great way to start the wind down to the weekend ! Sounds too like a really good fun sociable neighbourhood . Are there any houses up for sale ? = Have a great weekend ! And enjoy your Troubadour tonight ! <p> Appetizers and a couple glasses of wine really is the way to get the weekend started ! We look forward to Thursday nights as they 're a chance to unwind a little bit as we head into the weekend . I do n't  think there are any houses for sale at the moment on our street , but I 'm sure one will turn up soon . I 'll keep you updated ! hah ! = Thanks , Neil ! <p> Wait there 's no singing songs about chivalry and courtly love ? ? ? Whaattt ? ? ? I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marching band racket or no racket ! But , seeing my music skills are on par with my dancing skills ( non-existent that is ) I 'll leave the harmonica and fiddles up to yall and stick with the maracas deal ? = Seriously , David this sounds like such a fun tradition ! Now , onto these piquante peppers stuffing them with that delicious chive-Italian seasoning-garlic flavored goat cheese sounds like quite a delicious appetizer or meal ( me thinks ) BTW I need to look for Bota Boxed Wines next time we have a get together over here ! <p> Yeah , my music skills are pretty much non-existent , too , Shashialong with my dancing skills . But Robbie loves music , and he loves to dance . We went to a Fourth of July parade , and you shouldve seen him when the band went by ! = So I made another round of these stuffed peppers when Lauras parents were in townand we polished off the whole batch while sitting on the porch with a couple glasses of wine . Do give Bota Box a shot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to sing songs about chivalry and courtly love . And make sure to record it so I can see it , too . Ok ? Haha ! Thanks , my friend ! <p> Troubadours sounds like a wonderful idea to me . I love that its kept simple so the host does n't  have to go through a bunch of work or expense to host it . Its all about the connection and conversation anyway , right ? <p> And these appetizers you whipped up look addictive ! I love the creamy center and that tangy heat of the peppers . <p> Troubadours really is a fun concept , Marissa ! Its easy to pull together as each neighbor just needs to volunteer their back yard or porch for a night . And since its BYOB , there 's really very little prep work involved . Its a great way to learn more about your neighbors ! = Also , these stuffed peppers were delicious ! Do give them a shot ( with a glass of wine ! ) sometime . @qwx346875 146874 @qwx346874 146877 @qwx346877

What a great fall recipe and we are finally having some fall weather ! ! I love squash so this really appeals to me ! I do a twice baked squash with bacon and spinach . This would also be good made with sausage . We get " volunteer " squash every year from the previous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compost pile you WILL get squash ! Just be mindful of where you put them as squash need a lot of room to vine out . Have a great weekend ! PS Check out Nagis post today = <p> It seemed like it took Fall forever to arrive up here , too , Dorothy ! But its been a bit brisk lately , so now it finally feels like Fall . That , and the leaves are finally starting to turn , too . Its the best time of the year up here ! So needless to say , I 'm ready for some comfort food ! = <p> I 'd love to get some volunteer squash each year , but I 'm afraid the sheer temperatures up here might prevent those seeds from doing their business . We shall see ! <p> Great looking dish David . A good introduction of pumpkin season as you said ! I half wondered if you were going to use some of the smoked pork you mentioned . That said , what a great dish to serve when you got friends over ! <p> Ohhhnow you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be an awesome addition to these stuffed squash . In fact , I just posted a slow cooker pulled pork . I might have to use a bit of that on another round of stuffed squash ! = Thanks for the genius idea ! <p> Squash is in season and this is truly my favorite time of year . As soon as the leaves started changing my mother added Spaghetti Squash , acorn squash and butternut squash to most of her dishes . That might explain my obsessions of Squash . I love the idea of stuffing squash , it seems like acorn squash was created to be stuffed , its the perfect shape and size . I think Gourds and Squash are in the same family , I do n't have any proof but it makes sense to me. = <p> This truly is my favorite time of the year , too , Mary ! And cheers to squash being in season . I can usually find some great sales on squash , and this stuffed version is one of my favorite ways to prepare it ! And maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stuffed Ugly Gourds for dinner tonight ? = <p> Oooogood tip , Dana ! Thank you so much . It really was a pain to cut those acorn squash . Maybe my squash were particularly stubborn , but stillthat took some work ! Thanks for the microwave ideaand thanks for stopping by and commenting ! = <p> Ugly tomatoes ! Those are the best ! But the problem I have with ugly tomatoes is I never know when to pick them . A normal tomato turns nice and bright red , but some of those ugly ones stay purple or funky shades of yellow-red-purple striped . And then I end up leaving them on the vine too long ! Oh well , live and learn , right ? = <p> Firstly , thank goodness this is n't a spaghetti squash . Secondly , YES to ground beef in it- This is like an even better version of stuffed peppers , although more flavorful as acorn squash is superior to other squash ! <p> Hahawhats wrong with spaghetti squash ? I hear you can make spaghetti-os with it ! ( Grossspaghetti-os ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solved my problem of what to make for dinner tonight ! <p> This definitely made for a delicious dinner , Dawn !

These stuffed squash turned out quite welland what 's even better is the fact that squash are on sale again this week .

David , our Kroger has a bin with " ugly fruit/vegetables " these are definitely not eye candy , but one day , I was feeling a bit adventurous and brought a few pumpkin-looking things and obtuse looking peppers home and they tasted just fine .

@@30313965 @4013965/ <h> Classic Spanish Seafood Paella <p> Until a couple of weeks ago , I had never tried making paella at home. - I 'd had paella in several restaurants , and I always thought it was a delicious entree. - So I decided the time had come to give paella a shot at home ! - If you are n't  familiar with paella , its a classic Spanish dish that features the unique flavor of saffron. - I 've even heard paella described as the unofficial national dish of Spain. - One of the nice things about paella is that you can go in many different directions using a similar base of ingredients. - Ive seen chicken and chorizo paella , seafood paella , and also several mixed paellas , which include a combination of chicken and other land game along with various types of seafood. - No matter the choice of meat , the cooking style is always similarand paella always features saffron along with tasty olive oil . <p> Saffron is a unique spice in a variety of ways. - First , rather than a ground spice , saffron @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actually dried stigmas from a specific variety of crocus flower. - When my wife and I went to Italy a couple years ago for our honeymoon , we visited a vineyard that also produced saffron. - The owner of the vineyard described how the crocus would bloom for only a couple of weeks each year , and they would go out early in the morning each day to harvest the strands by hand before the flowers wilted from the heat of the sun. - No wonder saffron is one of the most expensive spices in the world ! - But the good thing is that saffron is a very potent spice , and most recipes call for a very small amount . <p> The proper way to cook paella is over an open flame using a unique pan called a paellera. - These round , shallow pans are often very large in diameter , and the finished paella is traditionally served at the table directly from the paellera. - ( I do n't  actually own a paellera , so I used a large saute pan , and it worked great. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home , then I will certainly consider picking up a paellera ! ) - Another unique feature of paella is the layer of crispy , toasted rice at the bottom of the pan. - This rice layer , called a socarrat , is created by increasing the heat at the very end of the cooking process until the rice actually begins to crackle. - As you can imagine , the socarrat features intense , delicious flavors , and it is the most sought-after portion of the finished paella . <p> For my first homemade paella , I decided to go with a classic seafood version. - There is something quite appealing and enticing about combining so many different varieties of seafood in one dish ! - And you can certainly be creative with your choice of seafood here. - I used some of my favorite types of seafood , but I 've also seen lobster , calamari , and clams used in paella. - Be creative ! <p> Place all 4 cups of chicken broth in a medium saucepan and heat over medium heat until boiling . Reduce the heat to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simmering for 10 minutes . <p> Pour the stock through a fine-mesh strainer . Add the saffron , stir gently , and allow the stock to rest off the heat . Discard shrimp shells . <p> Meanwhile , heat the oil on medium-high in a paellera or large saute pan . Add the shrimp and scallops and cook until done , about 2-3 minutes . Remove shrimp and mussels and set aside . <p> Using the same paellera or large saute pan , reduce the heat to medium and add the onion and garlic . Cook until onion begins to soften , about 5-6 minutes . Add the tomato , stir , and continue to cook for another 16-18 minutes , stirring often . ( Note : If the mixture begins to burn , add a tbsp of the broth . ) <p> Heat the broth back to a simmer in the saucepan . Add the rice to the paellera or saute pan and cook for 1-2 minutes over medium heat . Increase the heat to medium-high , add 3 cups of the broth , and slightly shake the pan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to cook for 8-10 minutes . ( Note : Once the rice is added , do not stir the paella again ! ) <p> Reduce heat to medium-low , add the mussels , and continue cooking until the rice is fully cooked . ( If all of the liquid in the pan is absorbed before the rice is done cooking , add enough of the reserved broth to prevent rice from burning . ) <p> Continue cooking over medium-low heat until the rice is fully cooked and all of the liquid has been absorbed , about 8-10 minutes . Add the shrimp and scallops to the pan , but do not stir . <p> Increase the heat to medium-high and cook until bottom layer of rice begins to crackle , about 2 minutes .

Here we bake them in olive oil and sea salt in the oven and eat them as a side with , well , almost everything . I-m defo going to try this one ! When are you guys heading to Germany ? ? <p> Oooobaked pepperoncini ? ? That sounds incredible ! I do n't  think Ive ever come across anything like that , but I 'm going to have to try that out sometime . The vinegar-y addition to the pasta salad here is so tasty , too . Oh , and we head out in a couple of weeks to Germanynot too much longer now ! = Thanks for remembering ! <p> I love those little peppers and hubby loves em @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not being able to make a small batch of pasta salad . Its , like , what 's to a box of pasta ? By the time everything is added , you can feed the whole street . Its seriously insane = I 'm loving this one , David ! The peppers , the smoked mozzarella.whats not to love ? I actually do n't  think I 'd mind one bit if I had a fridge full of this = <p> See ! I 'm glad someone else understands my dilemma when it comes to pasta salad . I 've made small pasta salads before with a 1/2 box of pastaand I 'm always just disappointed . I like my pasta salad to last for a couple of days of yummy deliciousness ! ( Or just 1 huge partyeither way . ) So the pepperoncini are totally a fun addition to this pasta salad . The vinegar-y bite plus the smoked mozz is so addicting ! ! Thanks , Dawn ! <p> My all-time favorite pasta salad is this tortellini thing my mom used to make every Fourth of July . It was good , but your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This has everything I love in it ! For real , I 'll take down half a jar of pepperoncini in one sitting .

Have a great week , David ! <p> " this tortellini thing " Hmmm . Could you be more specific , Kelsie ? = So pepperoncini in a pasta salad is totally my new secret weapon ! The vinegaryness ( that 's a wordI promise ) is so addicted , and then the smoked mozz is so tasty in addition . Mmmm . Pasta salad . Thanks , my friend ! <p> This pasta salad looks utterly fabulous , David ! However , there 's one rule I 'd like to remind you there 's no such thing like " too much pasta salad " . Also , as another rule says , " If you still have too much pasta salad , send the leftovers to Ben " . I think these 2 rules totally make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ totally makes sense to me too . There are two things about it which make me love it . Firstly , its a pasta salad . Secondly , the use of smoked mozzarella . I do n't  need any more reasons to try it . Besides , I love that you used a dressing in a very moderate way there 's nothing worse than a pasta ( potato ) salad submerged in tons of dressing . Well done ! <p> Hahaha ! I like your rules , Ben ! And I agree with you . Pasta salad is just meant to be made in large batches . A small batch of pasta salad is just sad . It disappears way too fast and leaves me wanting more . So I say just make a big batch from the start ! = Smoked mozz really is the best , is n't it ? ? <p> Oh , I have several favorite pasta salads , too , Gaila ! The problem is making sure I make them all at least once during the summer . = This smoked mozz + pepperoncini version is definitely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again very soon . Haha ! Thanks so much , my friend ! <p> Mmmmmmm smoked mozzarella is my favorite . I do not make pasta salad enough , you are inspiring me to get out of my comfort zone . I have tons of fun pasta hanging out in my cabinet right now . I 'm a huge fan of pepperoncini , pepperoncinis in my subway salads , on my pizza and now in my pasta salad . Have a great week my friend <p> Pasta salads are so much fun ! And for me , a good pasta salad is the best summer appetizer ever ! = So if you 're already a fan of pepperoncini AND smoked mozz , then this pasta salad is absolutely calling your name , Mary ! Make it this weekend for a fun summer recipe . Mmmmpasta salad ! Thanks so much , my friend .

Just what I 'm looking for . I 'm also extremely grateful for how you 've used sour cream to cut the mayo . I 'm always looking for ways to reduce that and that 's a great idea ! <p> Yes ! Pasta salads do indeed make such good lunches for weekdays . Thats part of the reason why I like to just make big pasta salads right from the start . So I found that reduced-fat sour cream is a great way to cut some of the mayo in pasta salads . ( You could probably use plain Greek yogurt , too . ) Its got a nice tang , but cuts a lot of the fat out , too . We did n't  miss the mayo at all ! Thanks , Neil ! <p> I 'm all about the flavors in this salad David ! ! And too funny , I immediately thought of my college Papa Johns days when I saw the whole pepperoncinis . That and their garlic sauce were regular late night friends = This sounds amazing ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friends in college . Ill never forget em ! In fact , my roommate freshman year got into this habit of ordering a pizza every.single.night and eating it while watching the late night comedy shows . Yeah , that was a different time . Can you imagine doing that now ? ? = But I will gladly nibble on this pasta salad as a snack at midnight . Hah ! Thanks , my friend ! <p> Ha ! I always make a ton of pasta salad and you had me thinking about that ginormous Tupperware bowl that does n't  quite fit in my cabinet . You know , the white one with the blue lid ? I never complain about too much mayo on anything , but I love your creativity with the pepperoncini vinegar ! <p> Oh , this is one super tasty pasta salad , Puja ! The smoked flavor from the cheese combined with the vinegar flavor from the pepperoncini is quite fun . Do give it a shot sometime this summer ! = Thanks so much ! <p> THIS is simply brilliant ! Adding pepperoncini and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ olives makes for one EPIC pasta salad ! You are correct , mayo laden pasta salads do get a bad rap and I 'm one of those people who pass on the mayo ones but this would be hard to pass on loving the substitutions and still swooning over that pepperoncini and pepperoncini juice in this pasta salad now when are you are Laura hosting yalls next one ? = <p> Why thank you very much , Shashi !

" - Thanks to the Rum Times series , Puerto Rico is presented in a new light . - I 've always known that Puerto Rico rums were among the worlds finest , but its interesting to see rum from this new historical perspective . <p> Last weekend , we had a murder to celebrate . - Uhh , well , that did n't  sound right . - More accurately , we had the capture of a murderer to celebrate . - ( And to think my neighbor was a murdererI thought I knew him so well ! ) - But this weekend ? - Well , we have 13 new reasons to celebrate . - Perhaps it will be the invention of blue jeans in 1873. - Or perhaps it will be the creation of the Gregorian Calendar ( i.e. modern calendar ) in 1582. - I do n't  know about you , but I 'm pretty happy about the creation of Fridays , Saturdays and Sundays ! - So what historical milestone will you be celebrating this weekend ? - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ party decor , drink recipes and musical playlists. - Let me know what you 'll be celebrating this weekend ! - Its Rum Time ! 146876 @qwx346876 <h> Comments <p> Sounds like you guys had loads of fun with that murder mystery party especially since you had all those amazing cocktails . Next time we should do a wolfpack murder mystery party . Where we murder a vampire , howl at the moon all night and drink beer . You in ? #WolfpackParty <p> I 'm down for a wolfpack murder mystery ! You can bring the delicious grub , and I 'll make some more of these Hurricanes ! But bewarethat would mean that one of the Wolfpack will be a killer . Are you ready to face that kind of truth ? <p> Murder mystery parties are my favorite kind of parties I had one for my daughters 14th birthday what an ice breaker it was as my daughter had friends there who knew her but not each other .

The food was tasty , and these Hurricanes really took the spotlight . I 'm all about finding any way possible to celebrate . The weather is starting to get warmer ( by warmer , I mean above freezing during the day ) , and I 'm ready to get out and party ! Time for another murder mystery . You should come up and join usbut only if you are n't  the killer ! Haha ! <p> The party was a BLAST , Christina ! Now that Spring is thinking about arriving sometime soon-ish , I 'm all about the party . But I never knew that my neighbor was hiding a secretturns out he committed a murder back in New Orleans . But we caught himthanks to a little help from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yes , we totally had a blast , Kevin ! There 's nothing like getting dressed up in ridiculous costumes with friends in order to have fun . It felt like we were kids again ! And of course , good food is a requirement ! = <p> If I did n't  read your content and saw just your recipes . I 'd swear you lived in Louisiana haha ! LOVE murder mystery parties- Although the last one my friend had in 2013 , half the guys got drunk before we even began . <p> Haha ! Well , I guess I did get a little obsessed with Cajun food when I was living down there in Louisiana . I love south Louisiana , and I only left because of that whole " I need a job " thing . If it was possible , I 'd be back there in a second ! Since that 's not possible right now , I just have to bring a bit of bayou up here to upstate New York instead . = P.S. Having half of the suspects drunk before the party starts tends to put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mystery party sounds like so much fun ! And this drink is so pretty and sounds delish ! I 'm not much of a drinker , but I will have a fruity drink from time to time and this one looks like something I would definitely enjoy ! <h> Trackbacks <p> what else ?

I personally like chicken stock for this dish . ) <p> 1 pound steak tips <p> 1 Tbsp olive oil <p> 1 medium onion , diced <p> 1 cup arborio style rice ( see note ) <p> 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese , grated <p> 1-2 tsp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Instructions <p> Using a medium saucepan , heat the stock over medium heat until simmering . ( Tip : the stock should be hot , but not boiling . ) <p> Meanwhile , cook steak tips to desired doneness and allows tips to rest at room temperature until risotto is done . ( Note : I prefer using a cast iron pan when cooking steak tips indoors . ) <p> While the steak tips are cooking , heat the olive oil over medium heat in a deep saute pan . Add the diced onion and saute until onion turns translucent in color ( 5-7 minutes ) . <p> Add arborio rice and stir until all grains are coated with olive oil . Add 1 cup of hot stock and stir until liquid is fully absorbed . Continue adding 1 cup of stock at a time and stirring until each addition is fully absorbed . This stage should take 20 minutes total . <p> Remove rice from heat and stir in grated Parmesan cheese . Finish with a drizzle of black truffle oil ( optional ) . Place cooked steak tips @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Arborio or " risotto " rice is essential for this recipe . Risotto will not work with other common types of rice . <p> Black truffle oil can be found in specialty food stores or perhaps in your local market . A little bit goes a long way , and it adds a deep flavor to this dish that makes it well worth the effort of finding the oil if you do n't already have it ! 146876 @qwx346876 <h> Comments <p> I used to be scared of making risotto simply because I watch a lot of cooking competitions , and a lot of chefs go home for poor risotto . Turns out its because they are too busy multitasking and competing to pay attention . I love making risotto at home , and I 'll have to give your steak tip one a try ! <p> You are so rightso many chefs get sent home on cooking competitions due to risotto ! But I think you 've nailed itthey are trying to do 87 things at once , and risotto really just requires its own special attention . So worth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for stopping by and commenting . You can usually find arborio rice ( sometimes called Risotto Rice ) in the grain section at your local grocery storeor certainly at a health food store if your local grocery store does n't  carry it . The black truffle oil might be a little harder to find , but its out thereespecially if you have a nicer grocery store in town . If nothing else , you can always order it online , too . Amazon is great for ordering things that you cant find locally ! I hope this helps a little bitdont be a stranger if you have @qwx346875 146874 @qwx346874 146877 @qwx346877

But when it doesyoull be ready ! Thanks so much , Shashi . We had a great weekend , and were off and running with the new week ! I hope you guys are doing well down there , too ! <p> Hi David ! Nothing beats a pulled pork sandwich with slaw ! I really like your kicked up dressing . My slow cooker has been in use all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the oven on a lot of days ! Plus you get the added bonus of smelling up the whole house ! <p> I could n't agree more , Dorothy ! Pulled pork sandwiches are definitely top 3 on my all-time comfort food listespecially when you pull them out of the freezer on a cold , cold winter night . = And of course I could n't resist putting a Cajun twist on this classic ! Thanks ! ! <p> I totally agree , Julie ! Slow cookers are an incredible inventionand then there 's the bonus of how the whole house smells amazing while they 're cookin away . I really appreciate you stopping by and commenting ! = <p> From the apple juice in the cooking to the tossing in of hot sauce after shredding and horseradish in the slaw dressing this recipe has all sorts of goods that are right up my alley . What 's your favorite bun with these ? I have used Potato , to French role and last time I used a ciabatta and found that best . <p> Oh there are so many awesome layers of flavor to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off those sandwiches in no time flat . That 's a good question about buns . I do like a ciabatta bun , but for pulled pork we typically prefer a super , super soft white bun . Basically the cheap hamburger buns from the store . That way , the bun soaks in all of the tasty juices . Oh man , now you have me craving pulled pork sandwiches at 7:45 in the morning ! <p> Hahathanks , Dannii ! ( Or is this Dave ? ) Either way , these sandwiches are super tastyand they taste even better when you freeze the pulled pork and then have dinner ready in about 10 minutes on a cold winter night ! = <p> Oh , I like pulled pork too ; mostly in theory cause I 've tried it just a few times in my life . And Ive never made it from scratch . I feel sad about that . I think the only one thing which can help me right now is this delicious sandwich , David ! You do n't  even need to send me a sandwich ship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll make a sandwich by myself ( I can not ask you do everything , right ? ) Thank you in advance ! : ) <p> Oh , pulled pork is so easy to make , Ben . I like making it on the smoker , but once the weather turns cold , its hard to venture outdoors . That 's where the slow cooker comes in ! You know what ? I 'm feeling nice today , so I 'll send a gigantic container of pulled pork up your wayyou better sit on the doorstep and wait for it ! = <p> Yes ! Another frozen pulled porker ! ( Ok , I may have just called you a porkerbut I promise I did n't  mean it like that . Haha ! ) The Cajun twist on this one was a lot of fun , too . Thanks so much , Rachelle ! <p> Once the little ones come , its hard to get away , but I 'm sure you will be able to plan a vacation soon . I love visiting the East Coast , especially DC , there is so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I do n't  eat meat , but that burger looked and smelt delicious . My friend devoured it and contemplated getting another one , I mean how could you not , I bet you it tasted better than it looked , which seem impossible . <p> I just dusted off my slow cooker because its Slow Cooking season = My favorite time of the year . I 'm a set it and forget it kind of girl . I 've never had Slow Cooker Pulled Pork ; the pictures make my mouth water with excitement . Great recipe David ! <p> It most definitely is slow cooker season ! ( Even though we have this strange upper 70s weather going on this weekwere normally around 60 this time of the year . Hey , I 'm not complaining ! ) I know you 're not a meat eater , but I wonder if there 's a way to do a veggie pulled pork/roast beef type of meal ? We might need to figure that one out ! Thanks so much , Mary ! = <p> Thanks so much , Lucie ! I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vacation spot ! But , yes , now that were back in chilly weather again its time to pull out the slow cooker . This pulled pork is a classic , and the Cajun twist is super fun ! = <p> This is the man who has grilled pizza , baked beer in pizza and created ice cream cones from wraps.and has n't  used a slow cooker ? ! Geebuz ! The slow cooker was the reason for pulled meat in my life . Luckily , you 've nailed it with this creation- The spices sound amazing ! <p> I know , I knowI just do n't  pull the slow cooker out all that much ! But I 've decided to fix that this year , matewatch out because slow cooker madness ( or should I say slow cooker deliciousness ) is coming your way ! <p> This Cajun Pulled Pork was a ton of fun to make , Matt . I mean I love anything in a slow cooker just because of how easy it isbut then adding on the coleslaw with a Cajun twist was fun . Oh , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talking like trash bags full . They hang out in our basement , and my wife tells me to get rid of them . But no way ! I need them for Mardi Gras every year ! = <p> Oh , you definitely need to 2nd guess your pulled pork thoughts ! Not only is pulled pork insanely easy in a crock pot , but you can then build some incredible sandwiches . Ultimate comfort food on a cold night right there ! Plus , your house will smell amazing while the pulled pork cooks . 146880 @qwx346880 <p> Comment 146879 @qwx346879 <p> Name * <p> Email * <p> Website 146875 @qwx346875 146874 @qwx346874 146877 @qwx346877

Using a pastry blender or two forks , cut in butter until mixture forms small pea-sized balls . <p> Slowly add water and toss mixture lightly with a fork until dough forms a single ball and pulls away from edge of bowl . If needed , add more water in very small increments until no dry ingredients left in bowl . Divide dough into 2 equal portions . Wrap each in plastic wrap and chill for 20 minutes . <p> Flour table well and roll out 1 portion of dough into a circle approximately 1/8 " thick and 11-12 " in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dough does not stick to rolling pin or table . ( Immediately dust rolling pin and table if dough begins to stick . ) Roll finished dough onto floured pin and unroll into pie pan . <p> Fill pie pan with Filling . <p> Repeat rolling process with the 2nd portion of dough , stopping after it has been rolled into a circle . Using a pizza cutter , cut dough into 12-14 strips approximately 3/4 " -1 " in diameter . Lay 5-7 strips horizontally across the pie , leaving space between each strip . Fold every other horizontal strip back and lay a new vertical strip perpendicular to the original strips . Unfold strips and then fold back the alternate horizontal strips . Place a new piece of vertical dough next to the first . Repeat this process of folding and unfolding every other strip until the lattice design is complete . ( See picture tutorial in the post above for help ! ) <p> Pinch the edges of the pie dough together , and then use culinary scissors to cut off extra dough . Crimp the edges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small bowl , and then brush the egg wash across the top of the exposed pie dough . ( You will likely not use the entire egg for this . ) <p> Sprinkle pie dough with a generous amount of turbinado or sanding sugar . <p> Bake at 425 for 45-48 minutes , or until pie crust turns golden brown in color . <p> Allow pie to cool before slicing . <p> Notes <p> Note : If bourbon is not your thing , then simply replace the bourbon with 3/4 cup of water . ( For added flavor , you can mix the reserved juice from the cherries with water . Just make sure that the total liquid still equals 3/4 cup ! ) <p> Thanks , Jim ! I did n't  use foil when baking the pie , but just keep an eye on it . If it starts taking on too much color , you can always add a foil cover . Make sure to let the pie cool before cutting itif you can wait ! Enjoy ! <p> Hey Carolyn ! I 've made this pie with frozen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cherries , reserving any liquid that comes out . Then instead of using the 3 Tbsp water ( when mixing with cornstarch ) , just substitute in an equal amount of the reserved liquid .

You could use those for this pie , but I think it would greatly change the flavor . The bourbon pairs so well with the sour flavor ! I suspect that you might be able to find sour cherries this time of the year down there in Nashville . Theyll likely be labeled " sour cherries " instead of a specific variety .

@@30314160 @4014160/ <h> Salted Caramel Mocha Iced Coffee <p> This Salted Caramel Mocha Iced Coffee is incredibly easy to makeand its the perfect treat on a hot summer afternoon ! <p> So how many of you out there thought that you make iced coffee by dumping a bunch of ice cubes into a pot of coffee ? I 'm ashamed to admit that I thought that 's how it was done . Boy , was I wrong ! My wife and I just got back from visiting my sister ( and her new baby ! ) down in Nashville , TN. - While we were there , she taught me the proper way to make iced coffee . And I 'm glad she did , because it was really hot down there . <p> Imagine thatits hot in the South in mid-June ! I grew up down South , and I 'm a Southern boy through-and-throughbut man , am I surprised at how fast I 've adjusted to the cooler temperatures in upstate New York . ( That 's ok , we more than made up for it with all of the snow from this past winter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nashville heat when my sister walked around the corner with Salted Caramel Mocha Iced Coffee for everyone . I wanted to hug her ! <p> So it turns out that ice coffee is incredibly easy to make . I love my morning cup of coffee , but I pretty much drink it hot . I do n't  care if its summer or winter , I crave a cup of hot coffee every morning . But now that I 've seen how easy it is to make iced coffee , I suspect I might be enjoying a lot of iced coffees as afternoon treats this summer ! <p> The problem with just dumping ice into a cup of coffee is that the ice instantly melts which dilutes the coffee into a watery mess . That 's where cold brewing comes in . All you need is coffee , water and about 12 hoursand the best part is this recipe pretty much makes itself ! My sister , the ultimate party planner that she is , also showed me another cool little trick . Once the cold-brewed coffee has sat overnight , you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cube trays . Then just plop these coffee ice cubes into your Salted Caramel Mocha Iced Coffee . This way , the drink stays chilled but it does n't  get diluted as the coffee melts . Genius I say ! ( But do n't  tell I said thatshe is still my sister after all . ) <p> If you 're looking for a fun ( and easy ) way to cool off on a hot summer day , then iced coffee is a sure bet . I used International Delights Salted Caramel Mocha coffee creamer , and it added a really fun layer of flavor . You could try this same recipe with any of the other International Delight flavors , too . I 'm thinking an Irish Creme Iced Coffee might need to make an appearance in my hand soon !

That lemon Dijon dressing on top is so fun for a warm summer day ! = <p> You 're right , David . Food is an absolutely universal language . Let 's say , we might not understand/know the languages or specific local terms/ingredients , but I believe almost every culture has their own bread or flat bread we would recognize . Or let 's say an apple pie or Christmas cookies ( especially gingerbread ) . Basically , they all are pretty much similar or even identical things , but look how many countries proudly have their own kind of pie or cookie . Isnt it great ? Pasta salad is an absolutely summer dish for me ( not even a side dish main course ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lemon mustard dressing I 'm not a fan of a mayo dressing in pasta salads at all . Normally , I go with the similar mustard dressing or just balsamic and olive oil . Deliciousness is in simplicity , is n't it ? And what a pretty name too ! Confetti . Now you need to make another pasta salad , in a trendy " unicorn " style haha : ) <p> Oh , you are absolutely right ! Every culture has some sort of flatbread . Every culture has some sort of cookie . Every culture even has some sort of gnocchi/dumpling . I do n't  know if pasta salad is universal , but I do know that I love making all sorts of pasta salads in the summer . This one is particularly fun thanks to the lemon Dijon dressing . I totally agree with you about mayo . I do n't  mind mayo in my pasta salad , but it must be used lightly . Very lightly ! And store-bought versions are often WAY too mayo-y for me . Oh man , how did I miss the unicorn angle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , my friend , good name ! <p> I could n't agree more , Heather !

I had etoufee when I did an internship in Louisiana and havent had it since so Ive been wanting to learn how to make it my only question or trouble was the rouxit would n't brown .

I absolutely love this etouffee recipe , and I love Cajun food ! Thank you so much for making it . = So making a roux is definitely one of the key pieces of this recipe ( and for many other Cajun recipes , too ) . Its a long , slow process . If you go hotter on your stove temperature , then it will cook fasterbut you run a serious risk of burning the roux . ( You know its burnt if little black specs start to show up in it . ) At that point , you really should just dump it and start over . That 's why I like to go a little lower on the heat , but it takes a long time . here 's the thing , though : you think its doing nothing for a long time , and then all of a sudden it starts to brown very quickly . I put 18-20 minutes in the recipe , but that time varies greatly based on the heat of your stove . Lower heat takes longer but ensures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this recipe a couple of weeks ago , and I recall the roux taking a solid 30+ minutes . Its just a slow process . But that 's where the flavor comes from . Give it a shot again ! Making a roux from scratch is one of those harder kitchen skills to master , but it can totally be done with a little practice . It sounds like you were almost there last night ! Like I said , it goes from yellow to brown to dark brown very quickly once it does start to turn color . I hope this helps . Its so difficult to explain how to make a rouxmuch easier to just stand there and show someone in person ! If you do try again , keep me updated on the process . I 'm happy to edit the instructions above if you have tips for other readers , too . Have a great weekend ! <p> Hi David ! Still poking around your site and I am getting hungry !

Fall is my favorite time of the year , if it ever gets here ! ! Little kids are exhausting , but in such a good way ! Have a fun weekend my friend ! PS Hummingbird cake on the docket for tomorrow ! = <p> Hahait sounds like Gary and I need to sit back with a bottle of Makers ! I always enjoy trying new bourbons , though , too . I agree with you . Fall seems to be taking its sweet time getting here this year . Were supposed to be in the mid-80s this weekthats unheard of for late September ! I 'm just hoping Fall does n't  entirely skip us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hope you guys enjoyed that hummingbird cakeits a great one ! Thanks , Dorothy ! = <p> Sometimes a good drink is the best way to relax after chasing around little ones ! When I think of apple cider I instinctively think of hot mulled cider , cold stuff is good too ( just a bit of tangy apple juice ) . This recipe however , I really like . Not just because of the use of Markers Mark ( brilliant ) , but with the ale and the lemon you got ta bit a zing and fizz to it . Well done . <p> Oh man , chasing little ones can absolutely take it out of you . I had no idea how hard it is ! But , yes , this cocktail was the perfect way to welcome in Autumneven if Autumn is being stubborn about when it wants to arrive this year . I agree with you about cider . I typically drink it hot , but its been so warm this year that I wanted to play with a cold cider drinkand this one was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agree , Kushi !

Speaking of bourbon with apple , I just saw some apple bourbon at the store the other day . Sounded interesting , but I did n't  get any . Not sure I want an entire bottle of it , ya know ? Hope you had a great weekend , my friend ! <p> Yeees , this " Runaway Cart " is n't every day scenery ( Never happened to me . Never ever . WellNever . Period ) , I guess . But I 'm just curious what would have happened if it had made its way to the road . Another question is why would anyone need so many eggs ( like 20 dozens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ investigation . The only one thinks being clear here , that you 've got a delicious fall cocktail here . Apple cider ? Yeeees please ! <p> Yeah , the runaway cart of eggs followed by a nun running at full speed just is n't an everyday sightbut I saw it ! And fortunately that cart did n't  make it into the road . Or into the bushes . I have indeed wondered why those nuns needed so many eggs ! But I decided they were buying for a whole convent , and perhaps the nuns at that convent liked omelettes ? = <p> Haha oh wow that nun chasing that shopping cart with eggs would have been a sight indeed ! But am assuming you were her hero in stopping that cart from meeting the road ? Way to go David ! By the way , gosh , I did n't  think it odd that yall had that antique-looking piece of furniture with yall and used it in that picture guess I just might have yall beat in the *crazy* department ! Blakely sure has grown and gotten cuter ! Speaking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Ive got ta pass this on to her it sounds like the perfect Fall drink when Fall finally gets here ! <p> Woah there , Shashi ! I do n't  know if I could be considered a hero here . I just saw a nun in need , and I helped out . = Seriously , though , that cart was flying across the parking lot , and I was probably the only one in range to stop it . I guess it was the right place , right time kinda thing ! And you 're totally right about Fallits supposed to stay in mid-80s all week here . That 's unheard of for upstate New York in late September ! Hope its not too brutally hot down there in A-town . <p> This drink sounds yummy , and you 're right , it looks like fall in a glass ! Love the picture of your niece ! And that story about the nuns is too funny . That 's certainly something you do n't  see a lot . I wonder what they were doing with the eggs hosting a church breakfast and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Yeah , I 've wondered that one a couple of times myself , Nicole . That was a LOT of eggs . A church breakfast would have been a good guess . I just assumed they might live in a convent , and they were stocking the kitchen . But I think your guess is probably closer to the truth . Either way , that would have been a whole mess of eggs if it had slammed into the side of my caror worse wandered into the middle @qwx346875 146874 @qwx346874 146877 @qwx346877

Would that be #hashbrown or #popover or #hashbrownpopover ? AhIm so confused now ! Hahabut yes , that would be incredible .

Though when it comes down to the last couple of servings , things start looking a lot like your wifes family get-togethers do when all the crabs are gone ! And speaking of fantastic that Cajun Seasoning mix sounds pretty fantastic too ! Oh and love the new addition to your deck ! <p> The potatoes ( and corn and sausage ) are perhaps my favorite part of a crawfish boil ! I mean , I love the crawfishbut all the other fixins are equally as good ! ( And do n't  even get in front of Laura when it goes to mushrooms from crawfish boilshaha ! ) Thanks , Shashi ! <p> I had crawfish once and loved them but I do n't  even know where to buy them around here . Guess well need to have a crawfish boil at some point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fan of crabs . I sort of like em but I would trade a burger for a crab . Even more so when the burger is Spicy Cajun Burger ( the seasoning is dope ! ) #WolfpackCrawfishBoil <p> Yes , we totally need to make that happen ! I 'm sure there is somewhere in the city that has crawfishthe city has everything ! Ill gladly sit in the corner with my burger and crawfish and let everyone else fight it out over the crabs . Nice to see that I 'll have companywell call it the Wolfpack Corner ! <p> Hi David ! You know how I feel about Cajun/Creole food ! And remoulade , just give me a spoon ! I especially like it as a dipping sauce for Cajun shrimp and Creole oysters ! When we lived in MI one of the local dive bars had a crawfish boil each year with beer at half price I 'm not sure which the locals came for ( probably the beer ) ! Even where I live in the hills of TN I can get crawfish in the frozen seafood section at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could use this remoulade sauce for just about anything ! Veggie dip ? Sure ! Straight up ? You know it ! Ill have to check at Walmart to see if they have crawfish . I 'm definitely a fan of the non-frozen kind , but you got ta make adjustments when you do n't  live in Louisiana ! Sign me up for some crawfish and half-priced beer for this afternoon ! = <p> Yeah , crabs are insanely expensiveeven in Maryland where they are known for their crabs . But Laura got her summer fill of crabs while I got my crawfish . ( Crawfish were about 1/10 price of crabsyet another reason they win ! ) You can sub in for my wife at the next crab boilalthough you might have to fight her for a 15-round battle to win . Ill just sit in the corner with Mike eating burgers and crawfishhaha ! <p> I absolutely love New Orleans style cajun cooking and definitely miss it up here in NY . Thanks so much for this recipe , all the spices and homemade remoulade look great . Also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your pictures such a great touch ! <p> Yeah , its hard to find good Cajun cooking this far from Louisiana , Feliciabut that 's why we just have to get into the kitchen and do it ourselves ! ( I also have 8 bags of Mardi Gras beads in my basementmy wife keeps wanting me to get rid of them . But thatll never happen . Haha ! ) <p> Such a cool grill system ! Believe me or not , but we still have n't got any . Probably next year . Next , it may sound unplausible , but I 'm not a huge fan of burgers . I can have one occasionally , but its difficult to inspire me . However , I would definitely give a try this bad guy ! I love the flavors going on here . Thyme , oregano , paprika , mustard .

I did n't  think twice about leaving it behind when I moved across the country , but now its summer I am missing it ! But until I buy another one , I can just drool over your burgers . This looks SO good ! <p> Oh geez , you have GOT to go out and pick up a grill soon , Cathleen . I agree that its a difficult thing to move across the countrybut that 's a good excuse to stop by and get a brand new one now . I cant imagine a summer without a grillyou have some seriously good willpower ! = <p> Okay , I am not sure what I am more obsessed with , that grill or that burger sauce . I am seriously drooling over that sauce . Saturday night is burger night in our house , so I think these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> I 've yet to have a crawfish boil myself , but I do look forward to it one day . Might I say I see no snow in your backyard , there is green everywhere and that beauty of a BBQ grill is awesome ! These Cajun burgers are a fantastic memory for breaking in the new grill , too . LOVE the Remoulade Sauce to top it all off . Well done Dave , have a great grilling weekend ! <p> Crawfish boils are a bunch of fun , Kevin ! I have a good spice mix for the boil if you ever need it . Its kinda hard to find the premixed crawfish boil packets up here in New Yorkand I 'm guessing its about the same in California .

Thanks , Johlene ! I hope your week is going well ! <p> Coconut + Lemon + Almond ? ? ? Yes Yes and Yes sounds like the perfect flavor combination . lol the name is kinda of wacky , I wonder who named all these random treats . There really is n't anything Louisiana about this cake but that would n't stop me from devouring it . Mmmmmm buttermilk pound cake , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love sneaking almond extract into recipes . It always makes everything that much better . Baking is therapeutic , not if I could only find someone to bake for . <p> Oh man , this flavor combination ! It really is quite tasty , Mary .

Thanks , my friend ! <p> Wow this sounds absolutely delicious ! I love all the flavors going on here . Almond extract is amazing when used in the right amount , glad you added only 1/4th teaspoon . I have ruined cakes in the past by adding way too much ! : / <p> Its so amazing how little almond extract it takes to really bring that flavor to a cake ! I mean 1/4 tsp was perfect , but 1/2 tsp would have been way overkill . I 've absolutely ruined my fair share of desserts with too much almond extract , too . Glad to hear its not just me !

I hope you 're well is going well so far . <p> Love your posts were you 're talking about both food and the origin of names/words ( although you did n't  much clear things up regards this delicious cake ) But you should consider writing a book which would cover both culinary and etymology . Anyway , this cake looks and sounds super delicious . Also , I think you did the right thing while mixing the coconut and almond flavors ! <p> Yeah , I think this post probably just confused things even further in terms of where the name of this cake came from . But then again , who really cares when the cake is this tasty , right ? = These flavors all play so well together , and they are perfect for the warmer nights that are comingor at least should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> You took me down memory lane with this post , David , as the last time I recall having a slice of Entenmann 's Louisiana Crunch Cake was way , way back during my college years ! I 'm so glad you came home and made your own version not only is your addition of lemon in the cake and almond in the icing make for a scrumptious slice , but I 'm willing to bet your homemade version trumps that packaged one anyday . I sure do agree , baking is therapeutic for me as well but so is slicing and dicing and all that stuff that goes with being in the kitchen at least that 's my two cents ! Now , am thinking you have some slices of this stored up in your freezer so guess what ? Yup , I will be a good friend and help you make room in that freezer by taking some of those slices out via drone is n't this a good idea or what ? ! = Hope you and the Spiced clan had a wonderful weekend ! <p> Well I 'm glad I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Shashi ! = I truly cant remember the last time I had a slice of the Entenmanns version , but I can absolutely say that this homemade cake is totally the bees knees ! I mean all of those flavors come together for one heck of a tasty summer treat . I think we might have a couple of slices of this one stashed away , but I 've heard that the drone is no longer capable of transporting desserts . Something about it being detrimental to its longterm use . Guess you 'll just have to come on up yourself for a slice of cake and a cup of joe ! Hope your week is going well so far , Shashi ! <p> Why thank you very much , Miriam ! This cake really is perfect for the warmer spring and summer days . = And nothing like baking a cake to relax , right ? ( Although I think eating it is even more relaxing ! ) Have a great weekend over there , my friend ! <p> This cake is absolutely delicious , Marissa !

( 2 ) The Southwestern Sauce tastes great on Day 1 , but it tastes even better on Day 2. - I 've actually started making the sauce the day before I make the tacos. ( 3 ) Shrimp cook very quickly on the grill . - Even though I do n't  serve these shrimp on skewers , I use skewers to help flip the shrimp while they 're on the grill . - It makes the grilling part much , much easier ! - ( Just remember to soak the wooden skewers in water for 30 minutes before using . ) <p> LOVING the sound of that marinade David coriander , cumin , lime and lemon mmm mmm mmm they are 4 of my favs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Farmers Market ! ! !

I actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back porch drinking lattes and eating these cupcakes instead ! ) <p> Lovely , lovely memories , David ! Unfortunately , I do n't  have anything like that to remember . I was a decent student , and I was spending a lot of my time in the library as well ( Indeed , I did love doing that ) . However , out student cafe was just outrageous , and got closed much earlier than the library and the other facilities . Needles to say , it would n't sell any peanut butter cookies . They did have some muffinsm but they were the way too far from your beautiful and delicious cupcakes ! Oh , I believe if I had had a few of them occasionally , I would have been an excellent student ( I was almost : ) ) Well I would probably even have started reading Latin poetry = Nice job , David ! <p> Hahaif these cupcakes could get you to start reading Latin poetry , then they must have some magical properties ! I mean , they do taste magicalbut they did n't  make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sitting in the bookshelf right next to me . ( Why exactly is that book still in my bookshelf ? ? ) I spent quite a few hours in that librarybut believe it or not , I do n't  think I sat foot in the library during my first two years in college . My grades during those first two years also reflected the fact that I never stepped into the library , too . Haha ! <p> I used to drink chai tea lattes in college too = Could we be any more similar ? Well , other than the obvious answer to that question . But on a more important topic , yes , even more important than Latin love poetry , CUPCAKES ! ! ! ! ! ! ! Wheres mine ? These look phenomenal . I can not pass up a cream cheese frosting . can not . Pinned ! <p> Quit copying me , Lindsey ! You are like my shadow . My awesome , pastry-making , cake-baking goddess of a shadow that is .

Its funny how thinking back to those marathon study sessions now evokes fond memoriesbecause at the time , I 'm pretty sure it was anything but fond ! Either way , cupcakes are guaranteed to make everything better . I think that 's written in small print at the bottom of every cupcake recipe : " Guaranteed to put you in a better mood when eaten .

Wow , you were an academic ! <p> Hahayou and that quad espresso , Kevin ! I 've heard about that thing ! But yes , the spices and smell of chai tea latte is absolutely addictinglet along the taste . I guess you could say I was an academic . Maybe I still am . I just prefer to study things in the kitchen now ! = <p> I am not sure how I could miss these cupcakes ! Dang I missed out during my college years we used to eat leftover ramen noodles one of my roommates added it to ice cream once and another made a " Falooda " with ramen noodles . I do remember the little shops in Abu Dhabi offering chai @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they would froth by pouring back and forth from cup to cup but they pail in comparison to these cupcakes ! <p> Wait . Leftover ramen noodles on top of ice cream ?

Insert a probe thermometer into the center of the brisket , close the lid , and walk away . <p> Occasionally check the temperature of the smoker to ensure it stays around 230-F +/- 10- . <p> When the internal temperature of the brisket reaches 165-F , remove the brisket and place in the disposable aluminum pan .

Add barbecue sauce and enjoy ! <p> Oh my word ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smoked meats . Ive been wanting to get a smoker for the longest time just cant ever seem to justify the cost .

It was totally way fun to chat with Chef Neville . I always find it really interesting to talk to the folks behind the scenes . And yes , you definitely need to get a smoker ! Good ones are indeed expensive , but I got mine as a birthday gift , and I 'm pretty sure its paid for itself by now with all of the delicious smoked meats ! = <p> This brisket looks amazing ! We have a smoker but for some reason we only really use it in the fall and early winter . I think it needs to be added to the summer grilling list . The mowing over the flower bed does n't  go well .. = Not that Ive EVER had my flower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absolutely need to get that smoker out and use it during the summer , too ! ( I agree , though , there is something about using the smoker on a nice Fall day . ) And I think I need training wheels on my mower <p> David , your brisket looks amazing ! ! I own a Pit Boss 620 wood pellet grill/smoker , do you have any advice for making the perfect brisket on a wood pellet grill ? The grill has two thermometers , one that 's controlled by a digital dial , and the other is the other is on the dome lid , which one of the two is more accurate ? On a finishing note , Texas is absolutely one of my favorite states ! ! Very friendly people there , and they know how to cook AMAZING food ! ! Have great summer ! <p> Wow ! Thank you so much for your comments , Rick ! Smoked brisket is by far one of my favorite things to smoke . I 've never had the opportunity to smoke on a wood pellet grill , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lump charcoal . I use a plate setter ( its an additional add-on sold by Big Green Egg ) that goes over the charcoal and helps distribute heat evenly . ( It also creates indirect heat which is one of the keys to making delicious smoked brisket . ) As far as thermometers , I remember reading somewhere that the dome thermometers are surprisingly inaccurate . I think it was something up to 25- off ! However , its the best I 've got without opening and closing the smoker constantly . I 'd guess that your digital dial thermometer is more accurate , but I cant say for sure . And I always , always , always use a probe thermometer in the brisket so that I know when the meat is done . If you have any other questions , do n't  hesitate to ask ! Oh , and check out my Pulled Pork recipe when you have timeits another one of my favorite things to smoke in the summer . Have a great day ! <p> Thanks David , I appreciate your response . I will definitely check out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well . After reading your post , I had to go Arbys and try the Smokehouse Brisket Sandwich , which was amazing ! I also like their Rubens ! <p> Good question , Nathan ! The time depends on the size of the brisket that you are smoking , but a good rule of thumb is about 1-1.5 hours per pound . I typically use about a 6-7 pound brisket , so it takes a good 6-9 hours or so . I know this sounds like a long time , but " low and slow " is the key to developing that delicious flavor ! Plus , you really should n't need to do much work once you have the smoker up and running at a stable temperature . I just keep an eye on it every 45-60 minutes to make sure the temperature has n't  gone crazy on me . Since you 're planning on serving this at a party , I 'd either start VERY early in the morning or just make it the day before . You 'll also want to leave yourself about an hour at the end to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really fun and delicious recipebut I 'd probably just make it the day before to avoid any stress ! Let me know how it turns out ! <p> Hey Shannon ! I 've never made this recipe in an electric smoker , but the process should be pretty similar . Just set the electric smoker to 250-F , and let it smoke away until the internal temperature of the brisket reaches about 180-185-F . The time will depend on the size of the brisket , but it should take anywhere from about 4-7 hours . I hope this helps ! If you make it on the electric smoker , make sure to come back and let me know how it turns out ! = <p> Sounds like you 're throwing a big party , Wendy ! I 've never made smoked brisket for 75 people , but I think we can figure this out . I 'd estimate 4 oz. of brisket per person which brings us to about 19 pounds of cooked brisket . However , cooked brisket is only about 50-65% of weight of the precooked brisketwhich means you 'll need somewhere around 29-39 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this also assumes that you 'll have plenty of side dishes , too . Macoroni salad is always a good option for a BBQ ! I hope this helps . That 's a big party you 've got going onId recommend cooking the brisket the day before . Since it is cooked " low and slow , " you do n't  want to stress yourself out trying to figure out when to start it so that it will be ready for the party . I hope this helpshappy brisket-ing ! ! = <p> Hey Jeff ! I do indeed use the BGE when I make smoked brisket . And yes , I do use use the place setter . Its invaluable when smoking things like brisket or pork shoulder ( pulled pork ) . Enjoyand let me know if you have any other questions ! = <p> Hey Kathy !

I will take that deal ! I 'll make you cinnamon rolls whenever you want if you grow the cinnamon tree . Seriouslyhow fun would it be to grow cinnamon ? I know nothing about the cultivation of it , but that 's what the interwebs are for , right ? Wed have the most glorious cinnamon rolls evah ! ! <p> Oooogood call on Christmas morning , Dannii !

I love that you can get these cinnamon rolls ready ahead of time and have them fresh and warm in the morning . Pinned to make later ! <p> Yes ! The cinnamon fairy ! I want to come back in a future life as the cinnamon fairy . I could just fly around dropping cinnamon sticks wherever I wanted . Oh , and yup , these cinnamon rolls are my new go-to recipe when we have company in town .

I 'm pretty sure I would love to gnaw on a cinnamon tree for breakfast every morning ! <p> Wow , I would totally have a cinnamon tree too- I remember when I first tried Big red ( I think ? Or red hots or something ) from the American candy store ( yep , we have one ! ) and was obsessed- So much that I burnt my tongue and could n't taste food for 2 weeks . <p> This looks insane and I can only imagine how good this would taste because of the time you let it sit ! <p> Hmmman American candy store ? I 'm intrigued what else is in this store ? Actually , I might be a little scared to see what else is in this store . We like our candy a bit too much here in the States . Oh well . Ill just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Haha ! ! <p> Whenever i make cinnamon rolls my mom reminds me to let them rest overnight . Shes right , because not only does it make them fluffy and full in texture ( and big and fat basically ) but the flavors really ruminate in the rolls . I love how big these are and how they look like anything youd get at an expensive bakery ! <p> That 's totally true , Kelsey ! Not only does letting the rolls rest overnight make them big and fluffy , but it totally makes life easy the next morning , too ! No need to go buy expensive cinnamon rolls from the bakery when you can make them this easily at home . = <p> BAHAHAHAAH I got this hilarious visual of you gnawing on a cinnamon tree and it made my morning . Possibly my whole weekend . And then I realized that if you had a cinnamon tree , I would probably just come live with you because cinnamon is my faves . So about these cinnamon rollsSee you tomorrow ! God , I love cinnamon rolls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what I 've been doing on my long weekend . = Deal ? Oh , and David , make it a double batch mmkay ? <p> Wowwhole weekend you say ? Woohoo ! Well , I have no shameI would gladly gnaw on a cinnamon tree if only I could get one to grow in my backyard . Hah ! Do n't  worry , thoughI would gladly save a branch for you . Just because were cool like that . So I 'll bring cinnamon rolls , and you bring breakfast dessert ( i.e. cupcakes ) , and I think we will be all set ! P.S. See you next weekend ( for realz ) ? ? <p> OoooI just had an idea , Tamara !

I 'm glad to see you stood your ground and knocked it out of the ballpark with this biscotti- NOTHING deserved to be dunked in coffee besides biscotti ( or a tim tam slam. ) and this a double whammy . Nailed it . <p> I 'm totally guilty of the PSL , but I try not to get too carried away because 600 calories in my morning coffee is not the way I want to start the day !

@@30314270 @4014270/ <h> Homemade Pie Crust : 7 Ways <p> Over the years , I 've heard lots of questions about making homemade pie dough . I 've also heard all sorts of excuses why folks do n't  want to make their own pie dough . - But guess what ? - Homemade pie dough really is n't that hard . - Sure , it takes a bit of practice . - It also takes longer than unwrapping a frozen pie shell from the store . - But Homemade Pie Dough tastes SO much better than the store bought stuffand its way cheaper , too ! - But here 's the thingthere are a lot of different versions of homemade pies . - This post is an attempt to categorize just a few of the more common techniques needed to make your own delicious homemade pie . <p> General Tips <p> Keep the Butter Cold : One of the most important things about making pie dough is to keep the butter cold . - The goal here is to roll out your dough into a thin sheet , and you 're going to have a heck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the butter in the fridge until right before you need it . - I often make the ball of pie dough and throw it back in the refrigerator for 15 minutes before rolling it out . - ( The heat of the room and your hands can warm it up quickly. ) - Sometimes I even put the rolled out pie shell in the fridge or freezer for a few minutes before adding the filling and putting it straight into the oven ! <p> Use Enough Flour When Rolling : Youll hear bakers say to be careful about how much flour you add when making pie dough . - True . - Too much flour can be a bad thing . - But pie dough stuck to the table when rolling is also a bad thing . - As soon as you notice your dough sticking to the table , lift up the dough and toss a small amount of flour under the dough . - Combine this idea with the cold butter from above and you you should have more success ! - You should be able to move @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Use a Pastry Cutter : - Pastry cutters allow you to quickly cut the butter into tiny pieces . - I used to cut butter into dough using two knives , but I find it SO much easier using a pastry cutter ! <p> Patch It Up : - Its not the end of the world if your pie dough starts to tear . - This dough is pretty forgiving . - If it tears , just pull a small piece from a corner or edge and patch it up . - It might not look the best , but it will absolutely be fine in the oven ! <p> Preheat a Baking Pan : Place a baking sheet in the oven when you begin preheating the oven . - Then put the pie on this baking sheet . - The hot surface will help the bottom of the pie bake fasterwhich keeps it from absorbing any liquid from the filling . - This means that the bottom of your pie will have a flakier crust . - If you happen to have a pizza stone , this is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the oven when you preheat it . ) <p> Make It Early : Do n't  stress yourself out trying to make the pie dough when your guests are arriving in 20 minutes . - Make the pie dough ahead of time , wrap it in plastic wrap , put it in a sandwich bag , and store it in the freezer. - Just make sure to thaw the dough in the refrigerator for about 12 hours before you need it . <p> The Rolling Pin is your Friend : - Just like flouring the countertop , its also important to flour the rolling pin . - Be gentle with the pin and tell the pie dough where you want it to go when you roll it . - Also , lift up the pin before you reach the edge of the dough . - Otherwise your edges will be much thinner than the middle ! - And when it comes to transferring the rolled dough into the pan ? - Just flour your rolling pin , gently roll the pie dough onto the pin , move it to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dish . <p> Styles of Homemade Pies <p> Single Crust . - This style of pie does n't  include a top . - Instead , a single layer of pie dough is laid across the bottom of the pie dish and up the edges . - Single crust pies are often used for custards or meringues ( Pumpkin Pie , Lemon Meringue Pie , Chocolate Pie , etc . ) <p> Galette. - Galettes are closely related to single crust pies , although they are typically a bit more rustic . - Instead of using a pie pan , galettes are often free formgiving them that rustic , homemade look that is perfect for an Autumn pie . - Check out these Rustic Apple Tarts- for an example of galette-style pies . <p> Blind Baked Crust. - Pie crusts are baked " blind " when baked without a filling . - When baking blind , make sure to dock the crust by using a fork to lightly prick all over the bottom of the dough . - This allows the steam to escape when baking , thus keeping a flat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to scatter a cup or so of dry beans across the bottom of the pie when baking blind . - The extra weight keeps the bottom shell in place . - ( I then keep these beans in a small bag in the pantry and pull them out next time I bake a blind crust. ) - This style is often used for cream-based pies ( Banana Cream Pie , Coconut Cream Pie , etc . <p> Double-Crusted. - Just like it sounds , double-crusted pies feature a top and bottom - crust . - When baking a double-crusted pie , do n't  forget to vent the top crust . - Basically cut a few small slits in the top crust to provide the steam a way to escape as the pie bakes. - Double-crusted pies are often used for fruit pies ( Cherry Pie , Apple Pie , etc. ) - Check out this Apple Cranberry Pie for a fun example of a double-crusted pie . <p> Lattice Pie . Lattice pies are a cross between a single and double-crusted pies . - They feature a solid bottom crust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dough is cut into strips and then " woven " to create a lattice design . - The same types of pies that work for double-crusted also work for lattice ( Cherry Pie , Apple Pie , etc. ) - Check out this previous post I wrote on making a Bourbon Sour Cherry Pie using a lattice design . <p> Cut-outs. - When making a double-crusted pie , it can be fun to roll out some extra pie dough and then use cookie cutters to cut out shapes . - These shapes can then be attached to the top of the pie using a little bit of beaten egg as " glue . " - One of my favorite ideas here is to cut out 5-6 leaves or apples and place them around the edges of an apple pie . - ( Do n't  forget to still vent the pie , though ! ) <p> Crust Designs. - While this last style is n't technically a different style of pie , it does provide a way to be creative and fun with your homemade pies . <p> Fork Crimped. - One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to simply press a fork into the dough all the way around the outer crust . <p> Finger Crimped . Equally as easy , another idea is to use your fingers to " pinch " the crust into a v-shaped pattern . <p> Braided. - If you are looking to be a bit more adventurous , try cutting 3 long strips of pie dough about 1/4 ? wide . - Braid these strips together and set aside . - Brush the edge of your pie with egg wash and then gently press the braided edge onto the pie crust . <p> And finally , I ca n't talk about homemade pies without suggesting to always sprinkle the top of the pie dough with a coarse sugar ( such as turbinado ) before baking . - A generous coating of coarse sugar gives the baked pie dough a wonderfully sweet , crunchy texturethe perfect addition to your favorite pie ! <p> 1 1/4 cups of pastry flour ( if you do n't have pastry flour , you can create a close substitute with 7/8 cups all-purpose flour and 3/8 cup cake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 8 Tbsp ; 4 oz ; 113 grams ) unsalted butter , diced and chilled <p> 1/8 - 1/4 cup cold water <p> Instructions <p> In a medium bowl , combine the flour and salt until well blended . <p> Using a pastry blender or two butter knives , cut in butter until mixture forms small pea-sized balls . <p> Slowly add water and toss mixture lightly with a fork until dough forms a single ball . If needed , add more water in very small increments until no dry ingredients left in bowl . ( *see note below ) <p> Chill dough for 20 minutes . <p> Flour table well and roll out dough until approximately 1/8 inch thick . Use caution at this step to ensure that dough does not stick to rolling pin or table . ( Dust pin and table if dough begins to stick . ) The dough should be approximately 12 " in diameter for a single pie crust . <p> Roll finished dough onto a well-floured pin and unroll into pie dish . Cut off any excess pie dough and shape edges as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and place dry beans on top as pie weights . ( This step may change depending on the style and type of pie that you are making . ) <p> If baking without a filling , bake at 425-F for 17-20 minutes or until shell is light golden brown in color . If baking with a filling , follow the instructions for that pie . ( Baking time will likely be 30 minutes or more depending on style of pie . ) <p> Notes <p> Note regarding amount of water : Start with the smaller amount ( 1/8 cup ) and gradually add more water as needed until the dough forms a single ball when compressed . The goal is to add only as much water as needed to hold the dough together . Sometimes this will be closer to 1/8 cup and other times it may be closer to 1/4 cup depending on humidity and other factors . 146876 @qwx346876 <h> Comments <p> Well , in the past I have failed at making pie crusts , so much so that I do n't  do them . Not even make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will try it once again . My Mother was such a wonderful cook , and her pies were out of this world . And I worry that I ca n't match up to her pies since my crusts are a mess . <p> Wow , thanks Jaan ! Making homemade pie dough does take a bit of practice , but its not near as hard as people might think . Just keep the butter ( and then the dough once its made ) super cold so that it does n't  melt and stick to the counter . Use flour as soon as it starts to stick , too ! And do n't  be afraid . Good luck , and let me know how it turns out ! ! <p> Hi David , This post brought back memories of Home Ec classes in middle school , where we learned how to do the " crimping " with our fingers . I had always thought it was really difficult until I tried it ! It makes the pie look more professional and its not really that hard . My mother-in-law was just talking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2013 . " Ok , so slight exaggeration on the name , but we were talking pies . The best ever is my step-fathers Dutch Apple Pie , I think he cheats and puts in too much butter and sugar , but oh man , is that good stuff ! SueAnn <p> Last time I baked a pie crust with butter it slid into the pan and made one huge mess ! I ate some of it because I thought it a waste of good butter and threw the rest away . I 'm going to try your recipe and hints , mainly freezing or refrigerating just before baking . Let 's hope it works ! I hate to waste . <p> Hey Lucille ! I totally know what you mean about an all-butter pie crust . But I was determined to figure it outand once I did , I wanted to include all of my tips in this post . = The real " trick " to pie crust is that you want the butter to evaporate and bake into the crust quickly rather than just melt . That 's why refrigerating/freezing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a pizza stone , throw it in the oven while it preheatsthe extra heat from the stone will help the bottom of the pie bake faster . I hate wasting , too , and I really hope this dough works for you . Happy ( early ) Thanksgiving ! ( Oh , and come back and tell me how the dough workedId love to hear . ) <p> Hi , I ended up turning my pie crust into mini hand pies and this dough worked perfectly for that use . I refrigerated the crust as you recommended . Then I put the little pies into the fridge for ten minutes before I put them into the oven and they were wonderful , The crust was flaky , tender , excellent ! Thanks for the tips ; no more store bought pie crust for me ! <p> Woohoo ! Your comment just made my day , Lucille ! I am so glad that this dough performed so well for you . Its all about the right proportion of butter in the dough and then going from cold to hot really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather than watersteam yields flaky pie crusts , water yields soggy pie crusts . Now that you are a master pie dough maker , your family and friends will start expecting pies from you all of the time ! Thanks again for reporting back on your successful baking ! = <p> I am definitely on the more crust , less fruit team , so I am very picky when it comes to flakiness . Here are my best tips : #1 Food processors are great for making pie dough , I 've been doing it for many years . Just be careful not to overdo it . #2 Latest tip going around , freeze your butter and grate it into the flour . Everyone is doing it now , works great . #3 Know the correct temperature and time for your pie dish . Shiny metal , dark metal , glass , ceramic all bake differently . #4 When baking fillings in a raw crust , brush the bottom pastry with egg white before filling it . It seals the moisture out and helps prevents sogginess. #5 To this day , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( no butter , no cutting in , and no chilling the dough ! ) from my 1960s Betty Crocker cookbook ( I actually use light olive oil ) . Always nice and flaky . #6 If all else fails , for a flaky crust , try a perforated pie pan . I never use one , but I have a perforated pizza pan that makes a really crisp pizza crust , so I know the holes work wonders ! Happy baking ! = <p> Hey there , Gramma Kaye ! Thank you so much for all of these tips ! I just recently tried making this pie dough using the frozen , grated butter trickand it worked beautifully ! So much easier than pulling out the pastry blender or two butter knives . I 've never tried brushing the dough with an egg white before filling itexcellent trick ! I can see why it would work , so I 'm definitely putting that on my list for holiday pies this year . Thanks again for taking the time to leave such @qwx346875 146874 @qwx346874 146877 @qwx346877
