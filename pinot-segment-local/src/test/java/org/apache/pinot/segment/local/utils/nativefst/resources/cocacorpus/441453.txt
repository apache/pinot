The press conference took place in a gorgeous suite above the track , as you can see below and included some fascinating conversation with- Producer Kevin Reher , Co-Producer Andrea Warren and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at ( above ) the track only added to the excitement . You could hear cars flying by and engines roaring as the filmmaker answered questions and recalled their experiences making this film . <p> As you might know , Cars 3 takes us on the continued journey of Lightning McQueens racing career . As a superstar , he McQueen faces the inevitable reality that we all face : time goes by . He s grown older and there is a new generation of younger cars on the track . This is n't a new problem of course , but its a great story that everyone can relate to and- Director Brian Fee shared with us just how they approached this storyline : <p> With McQueen , it just took a little research , we started talking to Jeff Gordon , we started to talking to other athletes and we started seeing people who were at the top of the game who were big celebrities , who had it all and , and they 're facing you know , the , the expiration date that all athletes have .

My job is not to get in there and mechanically do their jobs for them . My job is to inspire them with what the story needs are. - How do I want the audience to feel , what do we need to do , what does this scene need to achieve ? - And how can the lighting or how can the animation , how can that all come together and help us tell the story ? - So , I was able to just rely on the fact that they 're already good at what they do. - My job is to infuse them with the story we 're trying to tell . <p> Obviously a ton of time , energy and research goes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and hours of work and commitment to getting it all right. - Kevin Reher shared with us that there were over 250 people working on this film . <p> And they come and go , you know , they , they roll off and another department gets full of people . It 's around two hundred and fifty , two hundred and sixty people . It 's a village . <p> When you get a glimpse at the people behind these movies , you really start to see the passion and drive that brings these together . These people eat , sleep and breathe these movies until they are finally on the big screen . <p> I loved hearing how each of these filmmakers related to the movie in different ways . As you will see , some new characters change up the Cars dynamic and one such character is Cruz Ramirez . Andrea Warren shared with us that she related to Cruz the most , - and enjoyed working on the development of her story as a bit of a underdog or outsider . <p> I really love Cruz @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her to be such as admirable , likable character. - I think she finds herself , she 's very passionate about racing and she 's in this world where , she 's a little bit of a fish out of water. - And , yet she really makes her mark , she finds her way and throughout this movie I love that we get to know her more , we know about where she 's coming from and what motivates her. - <p> It was also neat to hear- Brian Fee share that as a father of daughters , he felt an obligation to send the right messages to young girls with the Cruz character . And how he could relate to some of the relationships in the film based off of his own parenting and the feeling of helping his daughters accomplish things . <p> There are so many fantastic messages in this film , and I think that everyone will take away something different .

As we all know , Pixar is all about story telling , and it is exciting and fascinating to me that they are so willing to share this process . But do you know why they do it ? I think they do it because they know that it ultimately inspires and helps to create and encourage new creative minds , which only leads to even bigger and better things . <p> Here is a peek at just a few of the topics covered on the Pixar in a Box site .

Something that we can all relate to , right ? <p> To get a realistic feel for this scenario , these team members interviewed NASCAR greats including drivers like Richard Petty , Junior Johnson and Jeff Gordon .

I asked them about that and they said it was so interesting to sit down with Jeff Gordon and hear his version of how he had lived this same story ! He was both the new kid on the track as well as the retired racer moving over and making way for new racers to come in . <p> I actually love how this story is written around something that we can all relate to .

Eileen has been a dear friend for several years . She is an amazing mom and honestly THE very funnest person to visit Disneyland with . I love her passion for protecting our kids and families in social media and I am SO thrilled to have her sharing her expertise here weekly with all of us ! Some of these topics are not the easiest , but they are definitely very timely and often eye-opening . I hope you will enjoy this series as much as I do ! <p> It seems screens are everywhere and parents struggle to create healthy limits on technology . We know our kids love social media ( and we do , too ! ) , but we also know balance is crucial . We try different ways to keep our kids from getting too much screen time and sometimes we feel we hit the mark . ( Hooray @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we might not be doing the right thing , especially when we get judged by other parents , their own strategies , and watchful eyes . Sometimes we even get called out on our efforts by well-meaning " friends . " <p> The struggle is real ! <p> We try our best and think things are going well , and then a fellow parent tries to take us down a few notches . This happened to me a while ago and I still remember it clearly : <p> Years ago , I sat at a high school sporting event watching my oldest son on the field . My two younger sons sat near me in the stands . ( You can probably get an idea of what was happening : the brothers wanted to be somewhere else , but we all went to the game . ) Were hungry because the event started just a bit too early to get dinner and were cold . Any of you love sitting on frigid , hard , metal bleachers while watching kids on a field ? Me neither . <p> Do n't  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school is awesome , I just wish it could be warmer and more comfortable ! But this is what we do as parents -we sit , we watch , we cheer , we support . Parents have done this forever ! So we do it . <p> My youngest asked , " Mom , can I play a game on your phone ? " <p> I answered my standard , " My phone is a tool , not a toy . You can go play on that other field if you do n't  want to sit here . " <p> A friend ( Acquaintance ? Is that more accurate ? ) sitting in front of me turned around after hearing my " not a toy " answer and said something like this : " You do n't  let your boys play on your phone ? Let 's see how long that lasts ! Hows that working for you ? " <p> Ummmmmmm . <p> I just laughed with them as they laughed at themselves and let that be my answer . What else was I going to say ? But I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expectations werent reasonable . We were hungry . It was cold . My son wanted to be somewhere else . Maybe playing a game could make things more comfortable . <p> Did I need to change my position on this ? <p> here 's the thing : I do n't  let my kids play on my phone . ( Unless I 'm really stuck on a level in Candy Crush , then Ive been known to pass it on to my middle son who seems to have some wildly innate ability to win at all things gaming . ) But the big , over-arching rule in our family is I just do n't  let my kids use my phone that way . <p> I know a lot of parents do , and the person who made the comment that day clearly does , but I do n't  . And its working out just fine , thank you . <p> Sure , I have games on my phone and I play them sometimes , so clearly , this makes my phone a toy as well as a tool . Its just not a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ devices where they play games , but they werent allowed to bring them to the game and I was n't going to let them use my phone during this time either . It just was n't how things were going to happen that evening . <p> here 's the thing : I feel setting this limit on my phone removes it as an option in the " I 'm bored . There 's nothing to do . " situation . My phone is n't used to entertain or distract my kids . That day at the game my sons went off and played with other friends who were there with their families watching their siblings play . My boys did n't  sit in the stands watching a screen and I think that 's important . Playing warmed them up and we ate dinner later . Problems solved . <p> Kids need to be comfortable with being a little uncomfortable and okay with that question of " what do I do next ? " They need to figure it out instead of automatically reaching for some sort of screen . This exploration and downtime builds their creativity and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also helps kids become connected to themselves , to who they are , and what they enjoy . <p> Downtime is n't something to be avoided , but instead , it can be welcomed . As a culture ( and maybe as humans ) we are losing our ability to just BE and this hurts us . As we feel compelled to constantly find something to occupy our minds and eyes and be entertained , were not looking up as much . Were not looking at each other as much . Were losing touch with the connectivity that 's crucial for us as human BEings ( see what I did there ? ) . <p> I 'm sure my friend ( let 's call them a friend ) was just trying to be funny . Their kids went off to play with mine eventually and all was well . Their comment just assured me that as parents were all looking at ways to limit technology and screen time for our kids . We all know its important and we all know its not easy . They were feeling my pain . <p> Help your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and friends , to see that tree over there , and take their faces away from screens . And help yourself to do the same . ( Yes . The irony that I 'm putting this information on a screen is absolutely NOT lost on me ! ) <p> Hold fast to the limits you set for technology even when others try to question your methods . And laugh as much as possible . <p> Go out and play and know that you 're doing the right thing for you and your kids . <p> Keep being awesome parents and thanks for this terrific opportunity , Keri Lyn ! <h> Connect with Eileen <p> Like what you 're reading here ?

If you are- considering hostas in your landscaping this year , or want to make the ones you have look even better , - take a look below at 7 tips for growing hosta plants successfully . <p> Many people turn to hostas when they want to fill a large- space easily , or if they have a less than green thumb since hostas are so easy to grow ! We use hosta plants to fill the area under our deck . It adds a lot of color and they are so easy to maintain . This is their 3rd summer and as you can see , they are really starting to fill in that area as they get bigger and bigger : <p> With a few easy tips and tricks you too can enjoy- hostas that come back thriving year after year . <p> 1 . Plant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love to spread their roots out wide . It is important that you plant hostas in well- tilled soil so that they can grow as needed . This will also make it easier to separate the hostas when it- comes time to do so . Till well before planting , and your hostas will be off to a great start . <p> 2 . Do n't go for instant gratification. - <p> Make sure to space them properly. - You might be tempted to fill in an area fast by cramming a bunch of hostas into the space . Avoid doing- this and instead be patient . The hostas will grow and spread quickly , so there is no need to crowd them- to try to fill in an empty space . Instead , be sure you are placing your hostas at least 18 inches apart from- each other ( certain varieties may require more ) so they can grow and spread as they need . <p> 3 . Keep them cool . <p> Hostas do prefer shady and cooler areas . They do well in shade gardens or landscaping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when planting hostas . They will survive if planted in full sun , however- they may not grow as quickly and may be more prone to damage and dryness . <p> 4 . Protect them from slugs . <p> Slugs love to nibble on hostas . An easy way to take care of this is to place slug traps around the plants. - This can be as easy as placing some beer in a shallow dish to catch the slugs , or you can treat the hostas- with a pest repellant to keep them at bay . I personally love the beer method and we use this snail shaped slug trap shown ( left ) . Its not only decorative , but it works ! ( great reviews on Amazon too ! ) <p> 5 . Watch for yellowing leaves . <p> Yellowing leaves can mean that you are overwatering your hostas . Hostas need about an inch of water- per week to stay healthy . If you have excessive rain do n't worry about watering as long as the soil is- moist . If you see yellowing , hold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ return to normal . We have our plants on a drip system which works really well for these plants , especially once you get a feel for how much water they need . <p> 6 . Divide hostas as needed . <p> Hostas may need to be divided once they become too large . If your hostas are 5+ years old , excessively- large , or starting to die off in the center , then it is time to separate them . Gently dig the plant up- keeping the roots intact , and separate the plants . You can then transplant the hostas into another space- in the yard . <p> 7 . Feel free to feed them ! <p> When you plant hostas for the first time or replant them after dividing , feel free to give them some slow- release fertilizer . You can also feed them at the start of the season and again 4 weeks later . They will like- this boost and can benefit from it ! <p> Are you ready to give hostas a try in your yard ?

Main character Lightning is a bit more old school . He has a rounder and more flowing shape with upright posture . New to the scene " hot shot " Jackson Storm is very angular and aggressive looking . <p> As for Cruz Ramirez , she had an even more unique design which created a few challenges .

@@26946758 @646758/ <h> Smart Parenting : Paying Attention to Social Media and Your Kids <p> Note From Keri Lyn I just wanted to mention how thrilled I am to have Eileen guest posting this series on the blog ! Eileen has been a dear friend for several years . She is an amazing mom and honestly THE very funnest person to visit Disneyland with . I love her passion for protecting our kids and families in social media and I am SO thrilled to have her sharing her expertise here weekly with all of us ! Some of these topics are not the easiest , but they are definitely very timely and often eye-opening . I hope you will enjoy this series as much as I do ! <h> Smart Parenting : Paying Attention to Social Media and Your Kids <p> As I teach my parenting classes and conduct seminars about parenting kids on social media , I hear stories from parents and caregivers about folks behaving badly when using their cell phones . Sometimes when I hear a story I declare it my " NEW FAVORITE ! " Of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that title for a short while until it gets replaced with a new one . <p> Well , this story may rank as my favorite for a long time . <p> According to my student ( let 's call her Sheila , shall we ? ) , she was waiting for her appointment in her dentists office when a little boy arrived with his mom and dad . The two-to-three-year-old started playing with the offices toys and the parents pulled out their cell phones . The child appeared occupied so they turned their attention to their- screens and let him play . <p> After a few minutes , the little boy looked over at Sheila and they locked eyes . Then he glanced back at his parents . He saw both mom and dad engrossed in the tiny world of their cell phones . <p> The little boy looked back at Sheila as if to say , " Watch this ! " and then climbed up on the coffee table in the waiting room . He stood up to his full height and grinned back at Sheila . <p> *I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little boy peered back at his parents one more time to make sure they werent watching and then he PULLED HIS PANTS DOWN AND STARTED TO DANCE ON THE TABLE ! <p> He moved and grooved for a short time in his underwear then he pulled up his pants , jumped off the table , and picked up the toy he held before he got on the table like nothing ever happened . <p> The parents did n't  move at all , their eyes never left their screens . They did n't  see anything that occurred in that room . <p> But Sheila saw it and the little boy knew she had . <p> Of course she was shocked and worked hard not to laugh . She could n't believe what she had just witnessed ! When she told the story in class we all erupted and could n't hold ourselves together as she had when she observed the boys behavior . <p> WOW ! <p> In one way this story is hysterical ! And then we talked about this more as a class and all realized its got some serious elements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the boy knew he could get away with naughty behavior in a public place because his parents locked their attention somewhere other than on him . <p> What a powerful lesson for a small child to learn . If he learns this at two or three , how does this knowledge transfer to a twelve or thirteen year old ? Something a lot more serious can happen at that age than dancing with pants down in a dentists office , that 's for certain . <p> I hear stories like this often , but this is the boldest demonstration of a childs blatant awareness of how tuned out parents ( or anyone ) becomes when they tune in to a cell phone . <p> What can we learn from this little scenario ? <p> I talk a lot about paying attention and modeling good manners when using technology in my classes and assemblies . Kids watch us as adults and learn more from our behavior than they learn from our words . <p> Ask yourself these important questions : <p> How do I model appropriate cell phone use ? <p> Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my child talks with me ? <p> When I drive do I put my cell phone on the " sorry I ca n't answer , I 'm driving " mode ? ( A lot of phones have this -check it out -and use it ! ) <p> At night do I unplug from technology to give my brain a chance to power down along with my devices ? <p> Do I pay attention to my kids when they are playing , or talking , or hanging out at the dentists office ? <p> How do I see my kids behaving well -or badly- when using a cell phone ? Are they learning that behavior from me ? <p> Checking out your own behavior and modeling proper manners and use with technology goes a long way with kids . " Do as I say , not as I do " does n't  go far these days , and it really never did in the first place , right ? <p> Technology opens up the world to us and we connect in ways we never could in the past . However , always remember @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of you -especially when it comes to paying attention to your kids . This story proves they watch us and learn from us all the time . Make sure you do this , or you may be caught with your pants down . ( I could n't resist ! ) <p> Keep being amazing parents and thanks for posting this , Keri Lyn ! <h> Connect with Eileen <p> If you are looking to learn more about and to stay up to date on the latest social media happenings and trends , especially where kids are concerned , then I highly encourage you to follow Eileen in social media !

@@26946804 @646804/ <h> How to Can Tomato Sauce <h> How to Can Tomato Sauce <p> Tomato Sauce is such a handy thing to have in your pantry . You can use it to make anything from sauces to soups and of course , using fresh canned tomatoes will give it the best flavor ! Today I 'm going to share how to can tomato sauce with you . <p> One of my favorite things to grow in our garden are tomatoes . They are SO easy to grow , but one of the trickiest thing about tomatoes is that when they do start growing , sometimes they literally grow out of control and you will find yourself with more tomatoes than you know what to do with ! Early on in our gardening days , I started looking for ways to take advantage of this , and I started to grow my collection of- Canning Supplies . If you have intentions of doing more canning in the future , this is a great idea and these are very useful things for years to come . Most importantly , invest in a good- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water canner that is pretty nice as well . Just remember to select quality canning appliances that will last you though the years , and regardless of what products you use , the directions are pretty simple . <p> Step One " Wash the tomatoes well with produce wash . Slice them into pieces that are small enough to go through your sauce maker ( I cut mine in quarters ) . <p> Step Two " Run the tomatoes through the sauce maker following the directions of your model . To get extra pulp , run the scraps back through the sauce maker . <p> Step Three " Place the tomato puree in a large stock pot and simmer for 20 minutes or until the sauce begins to cook down and thicken up a bit . The longer you cook your sauce the more it will boil down but the less likely it is to separate in the jars . <p> Step Four " Wash your jars thoroughly with warm water and soap . Place the tomato sauce into the jars . You will also need to add your acidic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teaspoon citric acid , 2 tablespoons of bottled lemon juice , or -+ cup apple cider vinegar per jar . Wipe the rims of the jars with a clean towel so that there is no residue on the rims . Begin to warm the water in your water bath canner . You will need enough water to cover all of the lids of the jars . <p> Step Five " Place the lid and rim on the jar and secure . <p> Step Six " Place the jars of tomato sauce into the canner . Ensure that there is at least 1 inch of water above the lids of the jars . Bring the water to a boil . <p> Step Seven " Boil the jars in the water bath canner for 30 minutes for pints and 35 minutes for quarts . <p> Step Eight " Once the time is up . Turn off the heat to the canner and let the water stop boiling . Gently remove the jars with a jar lifter and place on a dry towel on a flat surface . Do not touch the lids @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within an hour of removing them from the canner . <p> Note : Times/temps may need to be altered for altitudes . My times are based off 1500 feet above sea level . If any other products are added to the tomato sauce , times and canning procedures may need to be altered . 20 pounds of tomatoes will yield roughly 6 to 7 quarts of tomato sauce or 12 to 14 pints . <p> Its such a great feeling to stock your pantry with home canned goods , especially when you find yourself staring blankly into the pantry for a meal idea for your family . There are so many wonderful meal options that can be made with tomato sauce , and I have been so thankful many times to have my canned goods on hand ! <p> And now you know how to can tomato sauce !

@@26947003 @647003/ <h> Colgate Optic White Platinum High Impact White Toothpaste <p> *Disclosure : by another person . <p> I have written about Colgate products for years and I always get excited to test out their latest additions. - I have had quite a few people ask me about these latest Colgate whitening products , so I wanted to share this one with you today . <p> My thoughts ? - - I personally like Colgate products because they have such a strong minty flavor , but I also love that they are continuing to make these whitening products better and better . I remember that when they first came out with them , I could n't use them , they would make my mouth break out in the corners . I think they were just too harsh . But these last few whitening products not only have awesome flavor but they seem gentle on my teeth and they leave them feeling so wonderful . I really feel like the hydrogen peroxide does the trick when it comes to making a difference that you can see in the color of your teeth .
