Included among those victories are decisions over Northern Illinois , DePaul , UIC , Bradley and Chicago State , and three of those wins came on the road . &amp;#149 ; Wednesday 's game is a match-up of two of the top three defensive teams in the Horizon League . UIC ranks second in the conference by surrendering only 58.2 ppg , while the Ramblers are right on their heels , yielding less than half a point more per outing ( 58.5 ppg ) . &amp;#149 ; UIC head coach Howard Moore was an assistant coach on the Loyola staff during the 2004-05 season and helped the Ramblers to a 13-17 record that season .

UIC 's primary starting five is accounting for 51.4 of its 62.4 ppg . <p> SERIES STUFF Loyola and UIC renew a rivalry that dates back to 1986 and the Flames take a 30-18 advantage in the all-time series into Wednesday 's contest on the Near West side . The Ramblers have claimed five of the last six meetings between the teams , with the Flames ' only win in that stretch coming in the form of a 58-51 decision at the UIC Pavilion last January . Close contests have been the norm in this entertaining series as 19 of the last 24 meetings have been decided by 10 points or less and four of those games have gone into at least one overtime session .

On the flip side , the last five times the Ramblers have started conference action on the wrong side of the ledger , they have never finished higher than eighth in the final Horizon League standings . Loyola has not finished higher than eighth in conference play since 2006-07 when it posted a 10-6 mark and placed third . <p> THOUSAND ISLAND With a pair of free throws at the 19:18 mark of the second half the season opener against Toledo , senior forward Ben Averkamp became the 39th player in Loyola history to score 1,000 points .

Last season , Walt Gibler joined that exclusive club . <p> TEN SPOT A victory at Chicago State on January 20 would give the Ramblers 10 regular-season wins versus non-conference opponents for just the fifth time in school history and the first since 2006-07 . In 1979-80 , the Ramblers recorded 13 regular-season victories against non-conference foes . <p> WHITE LIGHTNING Freshman guard Jeff White has been a key performer off the bench of late and is averaging 6.3 ppg , 1.3 rpg , and 1.3 apg in 20.7 minutes per game over the last three contests . The 6-foot-1 guard is shooting 45 percent ( 9 for 20 ) from the field over the last three games and in home League tilts is producing 7.5 ppg on 64 percent ( 7 for 11 ) shooting . <p> GETTING IT DONE WITH DEFENSE An old adage states that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Ramblers should find themselves in the thick of the Horizon League race this winter .

The Ramblers have held the opposition under 50 points on nine occasions under Moser . Since the start of the 2011-12 season , Loyola 's defense has surrendered 55 points or less on 15 occasions after doing so just 15 times in the previous three seasons combined . Through games of January 13 , Loyola ranked 33rd in the nation in scoring defense at 58.5 ppg , and in its last four road games , has given up only 55.5 ppg and held teams to 41 percent ( 87 for 214 ) accuracy from the field and 25 percent ( 12 for 48 ) from long range . <p> TURK 'S A TRIPLE THREAT Freshman Devon Turk has given the Ramblers a bona fide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ season . The first true freshman to connect for at least one three-pointer in each of his first 10 games as a Rambler , the 6-foot-4 guard had his streak snapped when he was held without a trey at Saint Peter 's on December 22 , but he has knocked down multiple triples in each of the last five games . Turk has provided instant offense off the bench and ranks second among Horizon League freshmen with 8.9 ppg . Over the last nine games , the Houston native is pitching in 11.9 ppg and shooting 47 percent ( 35 for 74 ) from the field , including 49 percent ( 25 for 51 ) from long distance . Turk leads the Horizon League in three-point field goal percentage ( .473 ) and he torched Mississippi State for a career-best 21 points , 18 of which came in the first half , for the highest-scoring output by a Loyola true freshman since Jordan Hicks tallied 23 points at Butler on February 15 , 2009 . A sure sign of his ability to score in bunches can be found in Turk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effort against Mississippi State came in only 24 minutes of action and he also had 19 points in 24 minutes versus Furman , and 10 points in 11 minutes at DePaul . Strangely enough though , Loyola is just 3-4 when Turk scores in double figures . <p> THREE-MENDOUS One year removed from shooting only 31 percent from three-point range and not having a single player knock down more than 26 tries from beyond the arc , Loyola is leading the Horizon League in three-point field goal percentage ( .359 ) . Should the Ramblers be able to shoot that effectively for the remainder of the season , they could challenge the school record of .374 set during the 1996-97 campaign . Two years ago , Loyola led the Horizon League by draining 36.2 percent of its triple tries .

He has scored in double figures in 12 of his last 13 road games versus Horizon League opponents . <p> MAKING THE GRADE In addition to his exploits on the hardwood , Averkamp also is an exceptional student and campus leader who defines the term " student-athlete . " In November , the senior forward was named one of 30 candidates for the Senior CLASS Award , which is presented annually to the NCAA Division I senior with notable achievements in four areas of excellence - community , character , classroom and competition .

Heading into the UIC game , he has recorded 1,230 points , 575 rebounds , 162 assists , and 142 blocks . <p> THE SPIRIT OF ST . LOUIS Arguably the most improved player on the roster , Christian Thomas has gotten back into his comfort zone now that he is no longer being asked to play on the perimeter . The sophomore forward has emerged to become a force at both ends of the floor , especially in the last seven games , during which he is averaging 10.7 ppg , 7.0 rpg , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his field goal attempts . The St. Louis native has notched a double-double twice in the last seven games and is coming off of a 13-point , 11-rebound performance versus Wright State .

Thomas , who has scored in double figures five times in the last seven games , has been a thorn in Valparaiso 's side and after a 14-point performance there on January 2 , he is tallying 11.7 ppg in three career meetings versus the Crusaders and 5.3 ppg against everyone else . In his career @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ six or more rebounds . <p> NO ORDINARY JOE Sophomore Joe Crisman is a player who does a lot of the little things that do n't necessarily show up in the boxscore , but help the team win . One of the top defenders on the Rambler roster , on January 5 , he held Kendrick Perry of Youngstown State ( 16.5 ppg ) without a field goal for the first 27 minutes of the game , and on December 22 , he limited Saint Peter 's leading scorer Desi Washington ( 15.6 ppg ) to 3 of 13 shooting and just seven points . Loyola is 2-0 this season when he scores in double digits and in eight career games against teams from the state of Illinois , the Munster , Ind. , native is tallying 7.8 ppg , 3.3 rpg , and 1.8 apg . At home this season , he is shooting 59 percent ( 16 for 27 ) from the field and 54 percent ( 7 for 13 ) from triple territory . <p> MAYBE IT IS HOW YOU START Getting off to a strong start @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ history as it has gone 26-4 ( .867 ) when leading at the half since the start of the 2010-11 season .
