The album this week is- Solid Air- by John Martyn . <p> Released in 1973 on Island Records . A classic , quintessential album from a musical pioneer who beautifully fused British Folk , Jazz and Blues . The title track , Solid Air , was dedicated to Martyns friend Nick Drake a fellow musician who was suffering from severe depression at the time . The track , slurred in its message and melancholic in its tone is painfully understanding and sentimental . The journey throughout the rest of the album shifts fearlessly from rhythmic to romantic to hazy , always solid and alluringly executed .
