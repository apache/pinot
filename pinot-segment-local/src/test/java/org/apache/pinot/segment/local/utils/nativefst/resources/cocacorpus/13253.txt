@@13196470 @1796470/ <p> My washing machine is a front loader and it has an odd sour smell to it inside . My clothing does not smell totally fresh when I wash my clothes . I do not know if maybe there is water stuck somewhere or possibly the drain hose or the hoses where the water comes into the washer are moldy or are rotting . Can you give me some advise on what I can check to remove the odor from my washer ? <h> Washing Machine Odor Best Ways to Remove ! <p> The sour smelling odor is most likely from the stagnant water that is left behind after every wash . Bacteria and mold can form and cause this odor . The water stays standing in the drum and the drain hose . One smart thing to do to remove or reduce this odor is to wipe all the rubber seals and the inside of the washer out with a wash rag and a simple spray cleaner . After you have removed any excess water , mold , or gunk that may have been inside the washer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drum . Close the washer door and let it sit or soak for 3 hours .

@@13196471 @1796471/ <h> Refrigerator Water Dispenser Not Working After Filter Change <p> Fridge not dispensing water after new filter change ? I have just replaced the water filter on my refrigerator . The old one was 6 months old so it was time to replace it . I followed the instructions , unscrewed the old filter , and installed the new water filter in the fridge by screwing it in . I then tried to fill a cup of water using the water dispenser and it was only a trickle of water that came out . It sometimes makes a hammering noise while I try and dispense water . The old water filter let the water flow perfectly . My question is , do you think I have a bad new water filter or am I missing something ? <p> Refrigerator Water Dispenser Not Working After Filter Change <p> There are many different types of water filter configurations on refrigerators ( some fit in the top of the refrigerator compartment and others fit in the base of the refrigerator ) . You may need to consult your owners manual if some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refrigerator . <p> Refrigerator filter and housing parts breakdown ( applies to some refrigerators ) <p> NOTE : After removing the old filter from your refrigerator , remove 1 cup of water using the dispenser . If the dispenser fills the cup in 8 seconds then the water pressure to the refrigerator is correct and you can rule out any type of water pressure issue . <p> What could be the cause of the refrigerator water dispenser not working after a filter change ? : <p> 1 If your old refrigerator water filter worked and water flowed from the dispenser normally , but after installing a new water filter the water is only a trickle from the dispenser , try reinstalling the old filter to see if the cause of the issue is the new filter . <p> 2 You may have bought a cheap aftermarket water filter . Most refrigerator manufacturers state in the users manual to use ONLY water filters made by them = OEM Original Equipment Manufacturer . If you are using a non approved water filter , try using an OEM water filter . They will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ filter the water and let the water flow normally . Buy a new OEM water filter and that may fix your problem . <p> 3 Check to be sure nothing is blocking the water filter . Check that the threaded area where the filter will connect to the refrigerator has nothing blocking the small holes where the water will flow through . Sometimes part of the wrapping on the new filter itself could possibly block the water flow . If something is blocking flow , this will cause low flow . When you go to get a glass of water you will get only a trickle . Check to be sure the new water filter is clean and free of small debris before installing . <p> 4 The new water filter you installed may not be fully screwed ( or seated ) into the filter housing . If the filter is not fully threaded into the housing , low flow or a trickle can occur . Make sure you have the filter tightened properly . Remove the filter completely and reinstall making sure it is tight . <p> 5 There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ causing the issue . When you removed the old filter and replaced it with the new filter , it may have moved the gasket/seal . The seal is there to get the filter on air tight so no leaks occur . If applicable , pull off the gasket/seal and reinstall it . Then install the new filter . Make sure the water seal or rubber gasket is seated correctly and is aligned properly with the filter housing and filter . <p> 6 Your water filter may be installed too loose or too tight . You can try to dispense water while at the same time slightly unscrewing and tightening the filter at the same time . By doing this you are trying to find the exact tightness needed to let the filter operate properly . Sometimes the water filter has to be to an exact tightness in the filter housing for the water from the dispenser to flow correctly .

A hammering noise is a good indication that you have air trapped in the lines . This can happen when a new water filter is installed . The air creates a gap or pressure issue and the water does not flow out of the dispenser . You will get a slight trickle or nothing at all from the dispenser . Your newer fridge should have come with a bypass plug . This plug can be used in the water filter housing to completely bypass the filter . Install the bypass plug and run water for 3 minutes to clear any air or pressure issues in the water lines . Once water flows properly from the dispenser , wet your new filter and reinstall it . Test it by running water for a few minutes to be sure air is out of the lines . <p> 8 You may need to wet the new filter before installing it .

It uses the cover plate to seat the water filter , so there was no way to touch the cartridge when it was inserted . I taped a small small folded piece of paper towel to the end of the filter cartridge before inserting it into the refrigerator . That provided the little extra push the filter cartridge needed to work properly . <p> I have a Maytag MSD2272VEB00 side by side fridge .

Clean up all the water on the AC unit , on the window ledge , and on the floor of your room. Check and be sure the AC is tightly sealed in the window. Do you feel warm air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you feel warm air coming in you need to seal it correctly. Seal in the window AC unit to prevent warm air from entering the room. Check to see if the drain holes on the rear of the ac unit are blocked. Clean the drain holes to allow water to drip out. Make sure the filter is clean and not clogged with massive dirt or dust. After cleaning up the water and having it turned off for 30 minutes or so , turn it back on and see if the water appears again. If water appears and starts dripping into your room again , check to see if the AC unit is properly sealed in the window. If the AC unit is not sealed correctly , the moisture in the air coming in from outside gets condensed by the cold air inside the unit and this extra moisture builds up in AC unit and then leaks.SO BE SURE IT IS SEALED IN THE WINDOW CORRECTLY . <h> Here are some other reasons water can drip from a window air conditioner unit : <p> AIR LEAK AIR CONDITIONER NOT PROPERLY SEALED @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sealed correctly , the warmer air from outside gets inside the air conditioner . When this happens , the moisture that is in the warmer air will be condensed by the colder air inside the air conditioner . When there is excess moisture inside the AC , water will leak . So if this is happening to you , make sure you have a good seal around the window AC . <p> DRAIN IS BLOCKED DIRT OR DUST HAS BLOCKED THE DRAIN HOLES : There are drain holes ( drip pan ) at the rear of window AC units . They can get blocked from dusty conditions or dirt in the air . When this type of blockage happens , the water that would normally drip out will be trapped and water will leak from the front of the AC unit and at both sides of the unit . Be sure to keep the drain holes clean and free of debris . Also clean the filters or replace them to prevent any type of blockage that may cause a water leak . <p> OUTSIDE TEMP IS LOWER HEAVY MOISTURE IN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heavy moisture in the air outside , water evaporates much less than usual . This leads to excess water moisture in the air conditioner and this will cause water leaks . This is normal for most window AC units and using a drip pan can solve the issue if there is heavy moisture in the air outside . <p> CONDENSER PUMP NOT WORKING BROKEN OR CLOGGED PUMP : If the condenser pump in the AC is faulty or clogged , it will cause water to leak . You can check the condenser/pump if you feel confident . Check for any blockage or loose wires . If the pump seems to be okay visually , you will need to test the pump with a meter to see if it is faulty . If so , you may be better off buying a new AC unit .

How To Reset ? <p> My smoke alarm detector has been beeping and chirping every 30 to 45 seconds and I do n't  know what to do . This smoke detector will not stop beeping . What is wrong with it and how do I get it to stop ? It has kept me up all night with its high pitched beeping . There is no on or off switch . Its been doing this all night . The apartment maintenance man wont be available until tomorrow ! Do you know how to make it stop beeping ? <h> Smoke Detector Alarm Keeps Beeping Chirping How To Reset <p> You need to first be sure the smoke alarm is not beeping because of a fire or smoke coming from somewhere ! If there is a fire , leave your home immediately and call 911 . If there is no fire and your smoke detector beeps every 30 seconds or so , see below . <p> A smoke detector or smoke alarm in your home or apartment will beep or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smoke alarm will make this noise to alert you that soon the batteries will be completely dead .

You can twist the detector off the wall or ceiling counterclockwise ( or turn to the left and pull to remove ) . On the back of the smoke detector you will see a battery panel door . Open it and replace the old battery with a new one . The battery is usually a 9 volt battery . Once you add the new 9volt battery , shut the battery door . Test the smoke detector by pressing the test button and make sure it beeps . If it does , you have reset it by putting a new battery in it . Once the new battery is installed and you have tested it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or ceiling by turning it the opposite way it came off . Your smoke alarm should now be reset and installed properly . <p> Solution #2 Your smoke alarm may be wired into the wall . When they make the " chirp " noise it could be one of two things . Either the power has gone out to your complete home or apartment and your detector is telling you NO POWER , or the battery is dead and needs to be replaced . The smoke alarm has a back-up battery in case the power goes out . If the power has not gone out , then the battery needs to be replaced . To replace the back-up battery in a hard wired smoke alarm , turn off power breaker for safety first , then remove the detector from the wall or ceiling .

At times , the smoke detector cover can get coated with grease , dirt and dust that needs to be washed off . The dirt and dust on the smoke alarm may trigger it to chirp or beep . Keeping it clean will prevent this from happening .

I have a top load Kenmore washer that works great but the tub is not that big . I am simply trying to save time . Any tips or tricks are appreciated . <p> Can I Wash My Whites And Colored Clothes Together <p> ANSWER:It is not a good idea to wash whites with colored clothes if you want your white clothes to stay white .

Colored clothing should be washed many times before washing with white clothes . Set your washer to the shortest wash cycle and the coldest water setting possible . Do not use excess detergent .

Make sure to wash those items separately or with other clothes of a similar color . <p> The outcome of the wash can depend on whether you have soft or hard water . If you have hard water , colors should be separated . Soft water does a better job to not let colors bleed as much but be cautious with the white clothes . <p> You can try to wash clothes ( unsorted ) in cold . Sheets and towels in warm or hot water .

You may notice a residue of your laundry detergent still in your clothing or the clothes may be extra wet . Clothing that has not been rinsed properly is a sign there is an issue with your washing machine . We will help you to identify what may be causing the washer rinse problem . This will help you to find a solution as to why the washer does not rinse therefore fixing it yourself and saving money . <p> Washing machine not rinsing properly <p> Parts or problems on your washer that may cause it to not rinse properly:1 . Too much Detergent added2 . Overfilled Washer3 . Drain Pump not working or clogged4 . Drain Hose may be bent or clogged5 . Water Supply Hoses bent or kinked6 . Water Supply Valves not fully open7 . Switch or Control Board malfunction <p> The 7 items listed are the MOST COMMON reasons for a washer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rinsing the soap out , the rinse cycle does not work at all , the rinse cycle does not fill with water , or the water fills slow during rinse . Below we will go into detail as to what you should check to get your washing machine to rinse properly again . <p> 1 . Excess Detergent : Using too much of your detergent ( HE or powdered ) can cause your clothing to have soap residue left in it . You may have used a type of detergent that is not recommended for your washer . Do not use too much detergent and do not add the wrong type . <p> 2 . Excess Clothing in Washer : Overloading the washing machine with clothing can cause an improper rinse . Adding just one large blanket may make your washer not able to fully rinse . Reduce the size of your wash load . <p> 3 . Drain Pump Bad or Clogged : If you have a bad drain pump or a clogged pump this will affect the rinsing of your clothing .

A bend in the drain hose will cause improper rinsing leaving soap and detergent residue . A drain hose blockage can cause dirty rinse water to back up and come back into the drum . Make sure the hose is not bent and free of debris . <p> 5 . Water Supply Hoses Bent : Be sure that the hoses that supply water to your washer are not bent or crimped . Sometimes when the washer is pushed back into place the hoses get bent and can not let the proper amount of water into your washer . Check to be sure the water supply hoses are not being restricted . <p> 6 .

A malfunctioning switch or control board can make your washer not rinse at all . A bad switch or control board can also stop your washer right before the rinse cycle begins . Check the function switch with a meter to see if it is causing the issue . The control board can be looked at to see if there are loose wire harnesses or any burn marks . <p> anil kumar , If your washer does n't  go through the washer rinse cycle , the most likely cause is the water valve .

The range portion works fine . <p> I have a Jenn-Air/Maytag Electric Range Model SCE30600 . The oven heating elements stopped heating although all four burners work . Neither bake or boil heats up . No visual damage to the elements . As we rarely use the boil element , nor the bake element frequently , this looks to be an issue outside the heating elements . When I set the bake temperature to 350F , the fan starts as expected , the bake indicating is on on the control display , however the preheating display stays at 100F which is the initial temperature , the heating elements remain cold . <p> I have a Maytag Performa Stove PER5750QCW . The bake stopped to heat , but broiler and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When I setup a temperature like 350F , this temperature can not be reached ( I can hear the tic tic of the panel control but nothing happens ) .

The continuity of the back element is ok ( about 19 ohmes ) , also the broil element is 16 ohmes and it works properly . The sensor is also correct ( about 1110 ohmes ) . <p> Also no wires damaged at visual verification . The control panel looks normal . Is it safe to plug the broil element into the bake element plug to confirm that the bake element is broken and not other things related to ?

Is the wiring in the back of the oven going to the bake element in perfect condition ?

So it seems you checked it and it is in the proper range . Both elements seem to be working as you have shown . There may be a shorting wire that may cause the bake element to not heat . There may also be an issue with the control board , it may be making the clicking noises like it is sending power to the bake element , but it may be faulty . Do some further troubleshooting and if all components test good or in the proper range , you may want to change out the control board . -RR <p> My oven stopped working .

I used to be able to wait five minutes for the reading to match the setting , but now , I have to wait 10-15 minutes . Yesterday , when I cooked something in it , I waited until the inside temperature read what the cooking temperature should be , and I placed the item in the over for 26 minutes , according to the directions .

Ive been looking online and I wonder do you think I need a new oven sensor or is there a fuse for my range . The model is ARTC7511WW . <p> Lori , If the oven does not work after self cleaning , then something most likely electrical is faulty . Use a meter to find out if the range is getting the proper power . If so test the fuse to be sure it is not blown . If not then you may have a bad sensor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -RR

Every time I wash my clothes in my washer , once it goes to drain the water , the kitchen sink makes gurgling sounds and sometimes suds and water comes out . Once it gurgles for awhile it goes back down . A little while later the main bathroom toilet gurgles and the bathroom sink and bathtub drain gurgle . Do I have a plumbing issue ? I have not changed anything and this issue has been happening in my home for about 6 months . I do not have a septic tank . What can I do myself to fix this annoying issue ? <h> Washer draining makes sink and toilet gurgle <p> Answer:Your washing machine probably shares the same waste pipe as the sinks , bathtub , and toilet . When your washing machine drains or empties the water , it pushes the water out at high volume using its drain pump . When gurgling at sinks or toilets occur , this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The blocked waste pipe does not allow the water from the washer to pump out fast enough . There may be all types of lint and gunk from the washing machine that is partially blocking the waste pipe . The waste pipe needs to be cleaned out either by a plumber or by using an enzyme based cleaner . ( You may also have a venting issue which is a whole different problem , see bottom of page ) . <p> Main waste drain line partially blocked ? If you assume the main waste pipe is blocked , you can try and fix this blockage yourself . Use an enzyme based drain cleaner such as ROEBIC bacterial drain and trap cleaner . This cleaner can be bought at any Home Improvement store . Put it in the kitchen sink , the washer drain , and the bathtub drain . Do this at night when the sinks and bathroom will not be used . Let the enzyme cleaner sit as long as possible and repeat many times . If a partially clogged waste line WAS the cause of your gurgling issue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gurgling stops , it is best to keep using the cleaner every 3 months or so and you will have no problems . This type of cleaner is safe to use regularly . This cleaner works well because the enzymes eat the soap and organic material in the drain line . This then allows the lint and other gunk to be flushed out completely . It will open up the drain lines to let the waste water flow properly therefore no more gurgling . <p> Venting issue ? Your washing machine may not have the correct drain connection . Do you experience slow draining or water on the floor ? If so , install a 2 ? inch drain with a P trap and connect a vent that connects to the main vent stack . If your home plumbing is the correct configuration , plunging your toilet can stop the gurgling . A partial blockage in the toilet waste line used as a vent can create venting problems . If you suspect you have a venting issue and not a waste line blockage , go on the roof and spray @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything that may be obstructing it . <p> Blocked Vents ? If the air vents are blocked , negative pressure will pull air from wherever it can . Water forms an airtight seal as it flows through the drain pipes . As the water flows , it pushes air and creates a vacuum . This vacuum can be strong enough to pull air through the toilet , sink , or bathtub drain , and create the gurgling noise . A gurgling toilet usually means that the vacuum will suck water out of the toilets trap and the room can fill with sewer gas . As said above , if a vent is clogged , spray water down into the main vent stack to clear it . <p> If all else fails , you may need to install other devices to your plumbing , redo your plumbing , snake your drain line , or call a professional plumber before the drain gets fully clogged and you have an overflow of water into your home . <p> Do you know of any other reasons a washing machine draining water would make sinks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @

Once the codes are cleared , put the washer into a manual diagnostic test and run the HEAVY AGITATION If after 15-20 Seconds the motor runs then you can rule out the motor , capacitor , control , and most likely the wiring harness connections ( although still check @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Remember , the timing wheel only turns in the transmission during the spin cycle . <p> Next , while in Manual diagnostics , try to get the unit to spin ; if the motor hums for a split second and then shuts down with the lid lock blinking ; go back into diagnostic codes and look for shifter or speed sensor errors . This is proof that the shifter/sensor assembly is the issue because the optical sensor is not reading the motor speed . <p> Just want to say thank you for your post on problems and how to correct them with my cabrio washing machine . $26 part on Amazon saved me having to buy my wife a new washing machine and your instructions were so straight to the point .

I am trying to light my expensive Yankee candle jar and the wick is just way too far down to get a lighter or match in there to light it . I was tilting the glass to get at it but it is still too far down . Is there a trick or an easier way to light it without burning myself ? I tried newspaper but it just went out and I do n't  want to set off the smoke alarm . The wax is not covering the wick , the wick is just too far down into the jar . <p> How do I light a hard to reach candle ? <p> 1 USE A LIGHTER TO LIGHT THE CANDLE : To light the candle with a normal lighter , turn the candle completely upside down .

Once the candle is lit , turn it back to normal position immediately to avoid any dripping wax.Another way to use a normal lighter to light a hard to reach candle is to use your index finger to slide or press the flint mechanism . Hold the lighter with your thumb and your middle finger at the base and simultaneously pressing the gas on with your index finger . This lighter method can give you 2 more inches of reach and avoids making your fist into a ball to get down deeper into the candle . <p> 2 USE A MATCH TO LIGHT THE CANDLE:You can use a normal match if you hold it correctly . The trick is to hold the match between your middle and ring finger . Hold the match on the tips of your finger to make sure it can go down deep into the candle .

I have a 55 ? inch flat screen TV that is not working properly and would like to repair it . The TV works but I think maybe a board or a cap inside is bad . Can you give me some advice as to what may be the issue ? I will explain what I have found so far . TV has power and it stays on standby just fine , the red light turns on when plugged in but no turned ON . Once turned ON , the light turns orange for a few seconds and then it goes to the ON green light . Sometimes it starts going only to orange but then back to the standby red light . The TV will work but only after turning it ON and OFF like 15 to 40 times . Do you think the power board or power supply is going bad therefore the TV will not turn on properly ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LCD Flat Screen TV With Power Issues <p> We have seen many large flat screen TVs do this . It is usually one or more bad capacitors on the power board . <p> A cap is a few bucks and easy to replace if you can desolder and solder . <p> You need to identify the bad capacitor . <p> The bad cap will look buldged out or extra fat and deformed . <p> The small cross on the top of the cap usually splits when they go bad . <p> ( This is because of a chemical reaction in the capacitor that expands therefore leading to the buldging . ) <p> Find the bad cap and replace it . <p> UNPLUG THE TV FIRSTThen open the TV case carefully and gently . Gain access to the inside of the TV so you can see all the boards inside . Look at the capacitors on the power board for any signs of buldging . If you see no buldging caps then you may need to just replace the complete power board which are not expensive . <p> At times , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ measure capacitance with a regular volt meter . You COULD order all the electrolytic capacitors you need for the TV power board . This would be time consuming and might not even work . A new power board would make the most sense . Need to find a special part for your LCD or LED flat screen TV ? Here is a Parts Store for LCD TV Parts . <p> TV Power Supply:The power board converts the ac line voltage which is 110 volts AC to lower voltages that are required for the operation of the television , very important is the stand by 5 volts needed by the microprocessor to stay wake so when it receives a command such as power on to turn on the power supply , then the power supply generates the secondary voltages needed which can vary by television , some are 12 to 18 volts needed by the audio circuit and 24 volts supply to the inverter board and numerous other voltages . <p> I have a hisense TV 58K321uw , it has no standby and is completely dead . Replaced the power board @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the power board blew again now I am not sure whether its the main board or the backlight that is also faulty . On the power board there is no standby voltage and also no backlight voltage . Now as I am trying to test do I bridge the the power on with ground or a voltage ? <p> Before you do anything else , try a different cord . I 've had 2 different Panasonic TVs that would n't power on after power interruptions/surges . Each time , 3 on the same TV , I simply replaced the detachable power cord and the TV works . Not sure why , because the cord which wo n't work on the TV anymore will work with other devices like computers and such . Weird , I know . Visited my son and saw that he had his TV apart and was trying to figure out why it would n't turn on . I supplied him with a new cord to try , and that fixed it . <p> I had a Samsung tv that would just turn off and on constantly . I took it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ volume and channels . This solved my issue for a while but then it began to have the same issue . Starting doing some research on Google and came across this article so I figured I 'd give it a try . Ordered a power board on eBay for $35 and so far it works . Hope this helps someone else some dollars . <p> I have Sony TV 46HX750 which shows 3 standby blinks and the screen does not turn on . It stopped working when there was a lightning strike nearby . I checked Power board and it seems to send standby voltage 3.3V to main board . <p> I purchased in 2013 a Samsung 46 inch LED HDTV ; S/N z4nf3cxd103278v ; model un46eh6000 . It does not turn on no power . If I try remote off and on , I can see faintly the red light go on and off . It is plugged in my power strip which is working . I do not know what to do . <p> I have a Sony LCD TV KDL 52v4100 it was flashing the code that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Put it in and nothing . So assuming it was the power board I ordered , I sent it back and put the old one back In . It gave me the flashes again so I ordered another power board and put it in and again nothing . I checked all the capacitors they all look good on the new board and the old one . So now can anyone give me an idea of what else may be wrong ? <p> I have an LG 55lm6410 No picture , backlights function , and I have sound . The boards present are a power supply board and a main board When I test all voltages on the output pins leading to the main board ( from the power supply board ) the 24v line only reads 3v . So I 'm assuming this will prevent my main board from being able to operate . I could n't see any visual damage on the power board . <p> I have a Samsung PS51E6500 It had vertical lines which looked a bit like 2 or 3 rows of dead pixels . One day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then thin again , but now a multicolour , seeming to have movement up and down . PICTURE TOTALLY DISAPPEARED Sound not affected , Turning on/off at turn on the screen grey colour seems to get lighter . Seems to indicate power board If I got one is it a task for a layperson with a suitable instruction video ? <p> I have a 49 ? Insignia 1080p 120 Hz TV that I bought two years ago . The red power light turns on when plugged in but the TV itself will not respond when the power button on the TV is pressed or the remote power button is pressed . Do you possibly know what might be causing this or how to fix it ? <p> Can tv power supply boards exhibiting scorch marks under the transistors connected to a heat sink be repaired by just replacing the blown caps and transistor that went bad or will the entire board need to be replaced ? This is a Samsung which made a pop noise and now just clicks when one tries to turn it on . <p> I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the house and the TV will not power ON . Nothing is burnt on the boards and the cord works . I have no meter to check the voltage but should i just replace the power supply board ? <p> Douglas , It would be BEST to check with a Multi-Meter to find out first but if you are unable , then the most likely board to fry from a lightning strike in your TV is the main power supply board as that is the first board in the TV to receive power . So that is the best guess but may NOT be the issue . Use a meter to be absolutely sure . -RR <p> Try changing the detachable power cord . Has worked for me many times . Weird , I know , but , for some reason , the power cords are sensitive to power interruptions and will not work after a triggering event . <p> Hi do n't  know make of tv its 40inch and has these numbers on the back grt 12880610047 its has a blue light for power that comes on but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then goes back to the blue light no picture or sound thanks <p> I own a sony klv-26s400a series LCD tv . Recently my tv was not switching on , so thought of checking it . I have doubt on power supply and need some inputs on testing the power supply . I see that the fuse was blown and pcb near one of the switching transistor is dark , i am suspecting the switching transistor . My question is after replacing the transistor how do i test it , I have only the power supply board and outputs connection to the other pcb are removed . 1 ) can we test the power board without connecting the load ( the output to the other pcb ) 2 ) can we see the output voltage at the connector without connecting the load . 3 ) is standby voltage 3,3 v is always available irrespective of power on switch . 4 ) there is pins saying power on do we need to short this pins to get the output voltage . <p> Thanks for posting how to fix a flat screen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this list of things that I should check for if my TV has a bad capacitor .

Let us know and we can give you more info about what part to replace . <p> When you say your TV POPPED , did you smell any electrical smell ? Do you see any burnt residue on the inside of the T ? Have you checked all the caps on the boards ? Usually a POP is a cap popping in the TV on a circuit board . -RR <p> It just made a noise . No smell , or smoke . No signs of anything burnt inside .

I 've used a multimeter to check the connector and it is getting all the right voltages when it is plugged in . <p> BP-Carbide , If you replaced the power supply board and the TV will still not turn ON , have you inspected the ribbon cables to be sure they did not get pinched , damaged , or burnt when the TV popped ? Check all the other board to be sure of no damage or loose ribbon cables . It has to be something besides the main power board obviously , so check everything once over and let us know what you find . -RR <p> I have a 60 inch LCD flat screen tv .

Any feedback you can give me would be greatly appreciated . <p> Christopher Lee Winget , From what you have described about your Emerson TV , we would guess the power board has failed . Do some further troubleshooting to be sure , but from the description of your problem , it sounds like a bad power circuit board . -RR <p> I have a Vizio E422AR i already replaced the power supply to the tv which i thought was the problem but the TV will come on but not stay on any ideas ?

Which I 'm sure that it has something to deal with and not the main board . Sould I replace the cap first just in case sense it is only $8 ? <p> Beau , You can try replacing the cap but is the cap visually bulged or look deformed in any way ? Try that first and if that does not fix your issue then buying a new power board or main board may be the next step . What exactly is the issue with the TV ? -RR <p> Yes I just took it apart today and there is four that is bulged .

I have looked online to see if others have had this problem and from what I have read , it appears to be a capacitor problem . I called about replacing the capacitor and was told it would cost $175 . Then I read about replacing the power supply board which seems to be less expensive and easy to do myself . It is a model code LN46A550P3FXZA , serial #ALXK3CPQ507347V . Any help will be appreciated . <p> Mike , If you suspect a bad cap in your Samsung TV is causing the NOT POWERING ON issue , then replacing the power supply board is the easiest way to fix the issue .

It will turn on with no problems sometime and then if i turn it off it will not come back on I have unplugged it lots of times to get the TV to turn back on . I am just trying to figure out if its the main board or the power supply board The only light that comes on is a blue light when it is on . <p> Randy , The issue you are describing with your Apex TV sounds like the power supply board is on the fritz . Have you inspected the TV to see if the power cord may be bad , or where it connects ? Try another electrical cord , plug in to another outlet . If the cord is not the issue , then the power supply is the most likely issue causing your problem . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure your power cable is plugged into the TV and wall socket securly . Replace the power cable if needed . You can get them in any store that electronics are sold or online . Do not plug the TV into a cheap power strip that has surge protection . The junk power strips can go bad and cause situations that can damage your TV . To see if it is the cord or power strip issue , plug it directly into a wall socket . If all this is okay , the most likely issue is the power supply board in the TV . You can find them online and even on Amazon for cheap . Also be sure the issue is not with the TV input where the plug attaches into . If you do decide to change the power supply board , the instructions will be with it and YouTube videos can give you even better instructions to remove and replace . Here are Dynex TV parts . -RR

When your washing machine is filling up slowly with water or sometimes no water flows at all , it is usually clogged inlet screens , water valves not being fully open , or a solenoid valve water inlet issue . Many times you may hear a buzzing noise or a low hum when the water is trying to fill or if it is slow to fill . On most washers , this will happen on only one water temperature selection . This means that most of the time only the COLD water is slow to fill or the HOT water is slow to fill , not both at the same time . One of the water temp selections will be slow to fill and the other will flow as normal . Test both HOT and COLD water fills to see if both are not filling or it is just one or the other . Determine if the washer has an issue filling with the COLD water fill , HOT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Washer fills slowly What to check How to fix , repair <p> Water Valves &amp; Water Fill Hoses : You need to inspect a few things before replacing any water fill valves , inlet valves , or solenoids . These will be a few easy items to check . First be sure the HOT and COLD water valves that supply water to your washer are on and FULLY OPEN . Check the water fill hoses that go from the water valves on the wall to the washer . Be sure the water fill hoses are not bent , crimped , or clogged . Be sure that when you slide your washer back into its place , that the water fill hoses are not becoming bent or crimped behind the washer . Check with a mirror and flashlight once your washer is back in place to be sure your hoses did not get crimped once the washer was slid back in position . If both valves are fully open and the hoses are not bent , the next thing to check is where the hoses thread onto your washer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ filters near the ends of the water hoses that go into the washer . To see if they are clogged , the ends of the water hoses need to be removed . Turn the HOT and COLD water valves off behind your washer . Once off , unthread the water hoses from the back of the washer ( leave the other end of the hoses connected to the valves on the wall ) . Once unthreaded you will see the water inlet valve where water enters into the washer . There will be small circular inlet screens that are sitting in between the hoses and the inlet valve . Most likely there will be some sediment clogging up the small filter screens . If you choose , you can attempt to clean the filter screens ( or replace them if they come out ) but be careful not to push any of the gunk into the valve . ( It is not recommended to clean these screens as you can inadvertently push sediment into the solenoid valves causing them to stick open . If the valves stick open , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the open position . If the screens have massive gunk on them , it is recommended to just replace the whole water inlet valve . ) <p> Water Inlet Valve Bad Solenoid or Clogged Valve:The water inlet valve has 2 solenoids controlling water fill . A solenoid valve is an electrically controlled component . When a solenoid is sent power , it opens the water valve to let water into your washer . The solenoid valve or the inlet of the water inlet valve may be clogged with gunk or the solenoid is bad . You can test the solenoids for continuity with a multimeter to be sure . Sometimes a buzzing or humming sound will be heard when the water is filling and the water will be trickling in making the water SLOW TO FILL . If this is your case , the valve needs to be cleaned of the gunk so the water can flow into your washer properly . <p> Here is what a washing machine water inlet valve looks like <p> If the water inlet valve is not clogged or gunked up restricting water flow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the solenoids with a multimeter for continuity to be sure.If a solenoid is bad , you should remove and replace the complete water inlet valve.Make sure to also test to be sure the solenoids on the water inlet valve are GETTING power . Make sure the wire harness that connects to the valves are tight and secure . The water inlet valve will have the hookups for the 2 hoses , and 2 solenoid valves that control the HOT and COLD water fill . You can buy a new one online . Just be sure you have your washer model number handy and you can order the part yourself and replace it .

Can I use the 60W LED bulb in it safely ? <p> Lamp max wattage Which bulb to use ? <p> When the lamp states that it can only handle 10W watts , then it can only handle a true 10W draw . The wires and the on/off switch in the lamp are designed to handle only up to a 10 watt draw . A bulb that pulls more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overload . This can be a safety hazard and should be avoided . Always use the same or lower wattage light bulb the lamp or light fixture recommends . <p> To answer your question:You can safely use an LED bulb that draws ( or states on the package ) 10 watts as it will be as bright as a normal type of a 60 watt incandescent light bulb . Just remember a watt is a watt . If the lamp says maximum 10 watts , then that means it is not safe for anything with a higher wattage . Not only could the wiring overload , but the parts of the lamp could melt or even catch on fire if using a higher watt bulb . See chart below to understand brightness of light bulbs in lumens . <p> Watt Lumens LED CFL Incandescent light bulb chart <p> To try and understand watt and lumens , a 60 watt incandescent standard bulb will have a brightness of 700+ lumens.An LED light bulb that draws 10 watts , will have the same brightness of a 60 watt incandescent bulb at 700+ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used to how bright incandescent bulbs are in reference to wattage . On average , people usually use 60 watt incandescent light bulbs in the kitchen area and 75 watt incandescent bulbs in the bathroom . The ACTUAL wattage used by a bulb ( not its brightness in reference to incandescent bulbs ) is what you need to pay attention too . <p> Light bulb chart energy savings <p> If you will be using different types of lights in the lamp , remember that halogen lights burn very very hot . Use only exactly what is recommended on the lamp and no higher . 10 watts is the max whether it is an LED , Halogen , Fluorescent , Compact Fluorescent , or Incandescent . It makes no difference but be aware of the heat the bulb produces no matter what type of light you use . <p> Do you have questions or comments about using certain types of light bulbs in low wattage lamps or light fixtures ?

The lights on the digital display panel ALL light up for about 10 seconds and then it resets and tells me to enter the time . After 3 seconds it resets and goes back to the enter time prompt . Have to re-enter time , am/pm and date . The clock needs to be reset every time . How do you fix this ? Is something shorting out the power ? Is it an electrical issue or possibly a bad control board or touch panel ? <p> Microwave turns off after 3 seconds <p> It will depend on the brand of your microwave . It may be a bad or failing part on your microwave . You could have a door switch that is bad , a main control board that is faulty , and a few other parts that can be causing your microwave to shut off . We will list ALL replacement parts below . <p> Here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off after a few seconds : You put a cup of water in your microwave , press ONE MINUTE , and the microwave runs for 2 or 3 seconds and shuts off or resets itself . Almost like when you first plug it in , all lights on the digital display come on and then it asks you to enter in the time . It is like the microwave is resetting itself each time . You will have to do some troubleshooting to find the exact part that is causing your microwave to keep shutting off . <p> Microwave oven parts identification <p> Here is a list of the most likely parts that will need to be replaced if your microwave turns off after a few seconds , in order of MOST LIKELY : <p> 1 Microwave door switch = Check each door switch for arcing or burning . If there are no visible signs of damage then use a multimeter to test the switch for continuity . If there is no continuity or there is visible burn marks on the switch we recommend to replace the switch . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If the components are working as designed and you find nothing else bad then replace the main control board . <p> 3 Touchpad or Control Panel = Press each button on the control panel . If any buttons respond but some do not then replace the touchpad and control panel . <p> 4 Transformer = This component will produce a burning smell if it goes bad . DO NOT replace this yourself as it can hold large amounts of electricity even after being unplugged . If this part is bad , either throw your microwave away or hire an electrician to replace because of safety reasons . <p> 5 Thermoprotector = When the microwave runs for a few seconds and stops then the thermoprotector may be tripped . The thermoprotector is a safety device to make sure the microwave does not overheat . Use a multimeter and test for continuity to see if it needs to be replaced . <p> 6 Thermostat = Thermostat may be bad . Test it to be sure before replacing . <p> If your microwave is working properly ( but sometimes it turns off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see what may be bad , read on below <p> We had this same issue with our GE Model JVM Microwave . We replaced the turntable motor as we thought it was shorting out the microwave . This did not fix the microwave . We then unhooked the wire harness from the microwave turntable motor thinking this would help . This did not help , the microwave would shut off on its own every time after 3 seconds . We then took the microwave apart by first unplugging it from power and removing 2 screws from the grill at the very top of the microwave . After removing the top air inlet portion , we removed one screw that holds the control panel on . We removed the control panel by lifting UPWARDS on it . It then popped out and we looked at the control board and display panel . There was no sign of a damaged capacitor on the board or any burn spots whatsoever . The wiring looked fine and everything was plugged in as it should be . The control pad was in perfect condition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a multimeter and it tested good . So we then tried a few things <p> We then thought that if the problem happens after 3 seconds , maybe it had something to do with when it started to actually microwave ( cook ) . The first 2 or 3 seconds was just a short waiting period before the microwave would actually start to cook . The magnetron was possibly shorting the control board somehow ? Once the magnetron was running , the microwave oven turned off . <p> Instead of replacing parts one by one , we tried an experiment . We wanted to make a barrier between the magnetron and the main control board . We put a piece of aluminum foil in a computer style anti-static bag . We used 4 thick pieces of aluminum foil in each bag . We put one foil filled bag near the top of the back of the main control board , and one foil filled anti-static bag near the bottom of the control board . We made sure that no aluminum was touching any electrical components . We gently put the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in to hold it in place . We plugged in the microwave and tested it . The problem was fixed . Somehow RF was leaking from the magnetron and sending a frequency to the control board strong enough to reset it . By adding a barrier to the back of the main control board , the issue was fixed and we did not have to replace a single part . We hooked up the turntable motor , put all the parts back on the microwave and everything worked perfectly . We DO NOT recommend you do this as it is just meant as a test . If you try this and it fixes your microwave from shutting off , you should replace the magnetron in your microwave or buy a new microwave . <p> Have other reasons or parts that could be causing a microwave to stop working after a few seconds ? Please leave a comment below . <p> Andre F , Yes it would have been helpful , however . It is not an APPROVED repair or fix method for Microwave ovens . This is why we did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TRICK than a solution however it works for about 70% of microwaves with this issue . Simply search Google for HOW TO ADD A BARRIER BETWEEN CONTROL BOARD AND MAGNETRON IN A MICROWAVE OVEN and you will see pics. -RR <p> Saqib Saeed , Have you used the info above to attempt to solve the problem with your Microwave ? What is the make and model of your Microwave oven ? You may have interference with the board that needs to be blocked or a possible bad board -RR <p> My question is on a Quasar Panasonic high-end microwave convection unit from about 1992 . It runs well but the microwave function will quit after 1 to 5 minutes . I have wondered if it was moisture related but did not see the part in your video ( if its there ) relating to finding , identifying , testing or replacing a moisture sensor . But this may well not be the issue . <p> Q : Where would you suggest I begin testing ? In the past it had arcing on the upper door latch switch and I soldered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plastic part broke years ago and I now just push inwards with my finger has worked well for 10 years this way . The inside switch actuators are all solid and working well . <p> It has had some logic board oddities in the past , like failing to keep the mag fan on when the unit is running but this cleared up on its own some years ago . And I have a manual fan switch to force the fan to stay on as needed . <p> Bill Q , You may have an issue with the Magnetron putting out excess and actually making the board malfunction and therefore it shuts off after a few seconds . You can try the trick we have above by putting Aluminum foil in a thick bag and placing it in behind the board to disturb the interference . -RR <p> On our microwave , the RF signal was leaking therefore shorting the control board . Adding an aluminum barrier ( in a plastic bag ) helped stop the RF from interfering with the control board and fixed the issue .

There may be a few different reasons why the OE error code can display on your washing machine . LG washer getting the OE error code ? The OE error code on the LG washing machine display is an indication of a NO DRAIN issue . The 3 issues that may cause this fault code is a bent drain hose , the drain pump filter is blocked , or the drain pump may have foreign objects lodged in it making it unable to drain . All these issues can cause your LG washer to display the error code OE . With all these different reasons , checking all 3 components will clear the error and fix your LG washing machine . <p> The 3 conditions that will cause the OE error code on your LG Front Load Washer are:1 The Drain Pump Filter is Blocked or Filled with debris and needs to be cleaned out.2 The Drain Hose is bent and therefore water is unable to drain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pump and therefore the washer is unable to drain . <p> To check the drain pump filter : First remove power to the washer by unplugging it . Locate the filter on the front bottom of your LG washer . Remove the drain pump filter cover . Unhook the drain hose . Take off the small plug from the drain hose . Now drain the water that is still inside the tub . Use a small bowl to catch the water . Next twist the drain pump filter counter clockwise to remove it . Clean the drain pump filter by running it under warm water . Clean out the inside of the drain pump filter housing with a cleaning brush or rag . Put the cap back on the drain hose . Reconnect the hose to the washer . Slide the clean drain pump filter back into the washer . Be sure the filter is put back secure . Put the cover back on the drain pump filter by turning it clockwise . Once the filter is cleaned , re-secured , and free from any blockages , wash a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cleared . Video of LG washing machine error code OE drain pump cleanout is below . <p> LG front load washer drain pump filter location <p> LG Washer Cleaning the Drain Pump Filter <p> To check the washer drain hose : Look at the back of the washer and check that the washer drain hose is not bent or kinked . If the washing machine was pushed back and the drain hose was crimped behind it , the washer drain hose may be bent and draining water can not flow properly . Make sure the drain hose is straight and has NO blockage . Once the drain hose is straight and free from any blockages , wash a small load to be sure the LG front load washer error code OE has cleared . <p> Washing machine drain hose location <p> To check the drain pump : The drain pump is located inside the washer . It can be accessed by removing power to the washer , opening up the panel , and taking the hoses off the drain pump to check for blockages . This procedure should be done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the washer apart and can be safe with electrical components . We will put a video below on how to remove a drain pump on an LG washer for you to see step by step how to access the pump . After watching the video you should be able to understand how to safely get to the drain pump and to check to see if it is blocked or clogged and therefore causing your OE error code . <p> LG front load washer drain pump location <p> LG Washing Machine How To Access The Drain Pump <p> Do you have questions concerning your LG front load washer that is getting the OE error code ? Please leave a comment below and we will be happy to assist you . <p> We have the LG front loading and we are getting the OE error also , we have inspected all the pieces involved and have found nothing wrong . The pump actually will drain then when it is time to start the real spin ( fast ) it sits there and goofs around for X time then it pops the error @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on this and get it looked atFirst time in 3 years it has gave us any trouble anyway . <p> Ours did the exact same thing . It would act like it was draining for a couple of minutes and then we would get the OE code . I did all of the same checking looked for clogs everywhere then decided to just try replacing the pump ( $22 on Amazon ) . Sure enough , that was the issue and now our washer works perfectly . If it looks like you will have to pay out of pocket for service and you 're up for a DIY fix , replacing the pump really is pretty easy just carefully follow the video and set aside an hour of your time . <p> Two additional things : if you take the back panel off , in order to remove the drain hose to see if its clogged , you just have to find where it connects to the drain pump and loosen up a little metal clamp to get it off of the drain pump . Once the metal clamp is loose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ check it for clogs . I checked all of the hoses for clogs and checked the drain pump for clogs and found none , but I was still getting the error code . I honestly was n't sure if the issue was the drain pump itself or not , but it seem like the last resort and because it was only $20 , I figured it was worth replacing it to see that was the issue because it was still much cheaper than a new washer . Sure enough , that was the problem and my washer now works great with the new drain pump . So if you get to the point where you 're just not sure what 's wrong , I feel like its probably the drain pump . <p> How can I check to make sure my drain hose is n't clogged ? I had a rooter service come out last week , and now my oe code happens . I Cleaned out the filter , but it keeps happening . Could it be related to the rooter service . I have water around my washer and dryer . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinking it must be the board going bad . It will finish the wash cycle , not drain , then sit there flashing rinse . Seems to eventually time out and through the oe error code . here 's where it gets interesting , if I drain the water manually , through the bottom drain , it will suddenly start drawing on its own . Then it will allow me to run the rinse and spin cycle , where the machine will drain on its own , spin and complete the cycle . Do I spend $300 for a board on a nearly 10 year old washer ? Anyone have any other suggestions ? <p> I doubt its a board . Mines just as old and I keep it alive . My pump was missing ALL its fins . I 've also had the drain hose clog . Take a look at the top of the door gasket . It has a black tube at the top , comes from the pump . Mine has an inch of lint clogging it too . <p> So I watched the video here on how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ washer wont drain ) . Listened for the pump first , its working . The small black drain hose coming off the pump and out the door of the filter door was clogged with sand and small pebbles . I cleared this and am now attaching the pump back onto the washer frame . The three bolts do not want to get tight . Seems like way too much play in the pump body . Was wondering if they are loose to let the pump vibrate around without damage or what ? <p> We have a brand new LG and its giving us the OE code . Home Depot delivered and installed the washer last week . Ill check the first two steps and see if it fixes it . Ca n't imagine motor is out on a brand new washer . <p> Amy Actually , I think you can first start with a simpler approach . The little hose is only about 8 ? long and comes out of the pump motor and is just threaded through that little hole on the front of the washer to allow drainage . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it just came out of the hole . Before you take the whole washer apart , first take the back cover off . You should be able to get it off by just removing the 4 screws and then shimmying the metal back cover off . That will allow you to easily see inside the washer to see where the little hose is . I would bet you 'll quickly see it and find that it just came out of the hole . You can grab it and stick it right back through and voila . This should save you the hassle of taking the whole front of the washer off . Of course , before you take the back off , unplug the maschine and turn off the water valves . Hope this helps ! <p> I have checked the filter , the drain hose and then just disassembled everything . Through all 3 of these steps , I never found anything that looked off no foreign objects or clogs . I 'm about to put back together and see if it works , but how do I know if the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ test it ? <p> As an update , when I put it back together , it still would n't drain . It was n't obvious to me that the pump motor was bad , but that seemed like the only option left . I found a replacement pump motor on Amazon for $22 , got it in 2 days , installed it with the above video ( so helpful ) and now the washer works perfect . It took a little time but only cost me $22 to fix my washer ! <p> You an me both MBohio ! I did the exact same thing , and washing machine spins like a top . Only thing I wish was taking note when he said " take note of which wires go where " . I did n't  do that and ended up with some additional headache . <p> I read somewhere else that if you try to listen to the drain pump , and hear a hum , then you would know it is working . <p> Our LG WM3885HCCA washing machine stopped with an OE Error , not the first time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the rinse &amp; spin setting and fired it back up and away it went . Well this time no such luck and as luck would have it on a Friday morning before a long weekend . Of course the drain hose and filter were checked and fine so the only other problem would be the pump motor . I watched the video associated with this site and figured it would not be that challenging to replace . After calling around I found a motor at Sears Canada and they actually had one in stock . Using the video and following the steps I replaced the motor ( $70 ) in about 2 hours ! Sure beats a service call from a technician . For the $70 and a couple of hours I would not mess around , Steves video is so easy to follow and right on point ! <p> How do you test the drain pump to see if it is good ? I drained the tub and tried the rinse cycle but when it came time to drain the tub nothing happened . Is there a way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Is there a reset anywhere that would need to be reset before the drain pump starts to work ? I did n't  find anything plugged . <p> I have a WM2500CW front load washing machine that recently quit working and displayed the OE error code . I immediately checked the filter and it was not clogged ( or that dirty at all ) so I went ahead and broke things down . I removed the pump and all lines to and from it and cleaned them all out . After reassembling the unit all worked well but now , about 2 months later , the ugly OE error has reared its ugly head again . I began the troubleshooting steps again starting with running a rinse and spin cycle and it again threw the OE code again . I let it sit overnight ( too late to fool with it at the time ) and when I attempted the rinse and spin again the next morning it worked ! No error code and a completed cycle . I imagine that this is a temporary reprieve and that I will soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hoping someone might be able to provide so diagnostics that will allow me to determine if the pump may be going bad or if it could possibly be the control panel acting up . I do not like to play the " part swap " game and would rather be able to determine the exact problem before spending any $$$ . ( It is too hard to come by to waste ) . I have a multimeter and some basic electronic skills if someone can provide advice on checking the voltage or resistance of the components to help determine what the failure might be . <p> Small plastic disc was stuck in drain hose ! Video was a great help ; it saved my machine from getting scrapped . There was a coin shaped plastic disc that got stuck in the drain hose .

I have cleaned the filter , checked the hoses for clogs/ kinks , and even changed the drain pumps . I have also tried resetting the washer by pressing the on then start buttons for 5 sec each . It turned on and pumps about 2 cups out initially then continues to try to pump more out never progressing further into the cycle ending with the OE error . Any suggestions of what the real issue is ? <p> Had this OE code on my LG Washer and just wanted to add a few things . The little pump drain hose may need to be pulled in and out a couple times . It fills with sediment and may take a while to get flowing full force . With the filter removed , stick your finger to the left side and try to feel the pump impeller and rotate it . This will verify nothing is stuck in it . Again , the pump is on the left side . <p> Our LG WM2501 washer stopped with an OE error . I did not know what it was , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go for it and replace the drain pump , which was making louder than expected grinding noise when I restarted the machine on a Speed Wash/rinse , spin cycle . The trickiest part is the removal of the wire band that holds in place the washer boot . I was able to do it by carefully using a flathead screwdriver . It is even harder to put back . I used a spring expander tool that I had purchased for this purpose . I bought the cheap kind , the tension spring expander , a foot long screw thread with two prongs that stick out and a thumb screw that allows you to spread the two prongs apart . It worked out ! <p> The drain filter gets clogged and we cant get down on the floor to drain it and clear it out , how do we bypass the filter ?

Also , when I opened the tilting A LOT of water came out . <p> I got the OE error and already cleaned the drain pump filter , however I found small nail scissor inside that I cant get off through . What would you recommend me to do ? Should I dismount the pump as indicated in the video ? Is there any other way to remove the object blocking the drain pump ? <p> Thank you so much for the detailed directions on replacing the drain pump . We tried all the other fixes first , and finally decided to try and replace the pump . $25 later , the new pump is installed and no more error messages ! Your site and video saved us hundreds of dollars ! <p> My little black drain tube in the front of my washer next to the filter is clogged with what feels like sand . I got it out as much as I can but it still is n't draining so when I unscrew the filter water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . How do I unclog that ? ! <p> Mine was clogged as well with what looked like black sediment I could actually feel the hard clog in the middle of the tube and it was about 4 ? long so a lot .

I have cleaned the drain filter and checked for block hoses . All seem clear . I know the pump works and the pump hoses are clear because i can get it to drain if using a Rinse and Spin Cycle . I have placed the drain hoses in a nearby sink and it fills the sink very quickly . It seems to drain , but not all the way . What have i missed . Thanks in advance . <p> Kyn , Is it possible the drain hose on the back of the LG washer is kinked , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the washer drains the water out free of blockages ? If the washing machine drain pump and hoses are free of blockages and work properly as you have tested , the drain hose may be causing the problem . Have you checking the drain pump internally ? Is it possible there is a loose wire harness and when the washer runs and slightly vibrates , the drain pump or connection on main board cause the issue ? Let us know what you find . <p> If it drains but not all the way , you may be using too much detergent as the extra sudsing can cause the clothing to retain more water and also make it more difficult for the washer to remove the extra sudsing water . -RR <p> Thanks for the reply . The hoses are clear and not kinked . In fact , when pump runs , it pushes out water very fast . It just does n't  seem to want empty the entire drum . I have pulled the washer apart and unhooked every hose from the pump . All is clear . I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i use detergent or not . It will even happen on a Rinse and Spin cycle with or without detergent and minimal clothes . I have not checked the wiring harness specifically , but i did n't  see anything obvious when i had it apart . I have also checked to ensure i have 120 volts at the outlet . It is good . <p> I have issues with my LG front loader washer as well . It is a model I bought in Europe . I shipped it to south America . It is connected on 220V as the machine is for use on 220V and not the 110 . So it is new and still I get the error . I cleaned the filter drained any water . What can be the problem then ? <p> Raj , LG Washer OE error code is a draining error . Check and clean the FRONT LOWER DEBRIS FILTER . If you still get the OE error , check that the drain pump and the drain hose are not CLOGGED or BLOCKED . Remove all hoses connected to the pump and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between the pump and tub removed , check up inside the tub where the hose was removed and see if anything clogging it in that area . Clothing stuck between the tubs can also cause the OE error . -RR <p> Hi thanks for the advice . But I already tried them . After having a professional have a look at it the problem became clear . There was nothing wrong . The problem rather was that in spite of having the machine connected to 220V the problem was in the amount of Hz ! The machine was build for 50Hz and it needed 60Hz rotation to work . So the mechanical replaced the module . And now it is working as it should be . <p> Hello , we have an LG Top Load Washer , Model WT1201CV and I believe our pump is faulty . I have removed the old pump and will be ordering a new one . Can you tell me if the installation of the new pump is basically the reverse of the removal process ? Just wondering if there is anything I need to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ = <p> Washer has OE code . Cleaned the drain hose and drain filter . Still doesn drain even if the power is off . At the spin cycle ca n't hear any sound then few minutes later OE code shows up . Do you think I need to replace a drain pump ? <p> Julie , If you are getting the OE error code check that the drain pump is getting power on your LG washing machine . If so , check drain pump to be sure it is operational . If the pump checks bad , replace the pump . If it checks good , check all drain lines and hoses for blockages. -RR <p> Thank you ! I can not thank you enough ! I was having a problem with my LG front load washer/dryer combo . You help me figure out the error code OE . I watched your video . I drained the water.then cleaned out the filter . I did not realize that I needed to clean it out once a month . I found earrings , a stylus , disposable gloves , paper , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do it myself and saving me the time and money I would have had to spend finding someone to do what took me a half hour to do . Now I know ! <p> I finally found a Service Manual for my model and it shows a streamlined guide for drain issue on p25 ; <p> Is the drain hose twisted or frozen ? Repair the DRAIN HOSE ASSEMBLY . NO Is the impeller of the drain pump clogged ? Remove foreign material . NO Is the connector disconnected , disassembled ? Reconnect or repair the connector NO Is the coil of the drain pump too high or low ? ( resistance of the coil is 10-20 G ) Replace the DRAIN PUMP ASSEMBLY NO When checking voltage between connectors during spin , is the voltage 120 V AC as in the figure ? Replace the MAIN PWB ASSEMBLY . <p> I will find out tomorrow if new pump solves the problem . = my pump motor resistance appeared to be out of range . <p> Yes , I checked ALL of the plumbing , filter , hoses , even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , et al . While the OE is the finale of the error condition , the pump motor does n't  activate to drain at the proper times . It would be helpful to have troubleshooting guidance indicating in which order to test , the type test to perform and the test results which can be expected . I did find a decision tree for a different model , but it did not give expected test results . e.g. Test with multimeter ( what scale , range , UOM ohms , volts , amps is expected ? ) . <p> David , You may have a main control board that is on the fritz . If you know the drain pump works , but does not activate when it is supposed to , then either the board , or a wiring harness is bad , loose , damaged , etc -RR <p> My LG front load washer dryer combo will not drain . I have no clogs or bent hoses . It will not spin during this cycle . I have disassembled the unit and checked for I knew to check @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is working properly . I also ran it through a drain/spin cycle when it was disassembled and with the front panel off it spun without issue ( no water in the tub ) . Could this be some type of pressure switch ? <p> Wade , Can you give us the model number of your LG front load washer dryer and we can assist from there as it may be a pressure switch or door switch . We need the model number to direct you to which part may be causing the NO DRAIN issue . -RR <p> I have same issue with my WM2487HRMA . The drain motor works fine in test mode , no clogs , bends , etc . But it will not drain before spin cycle .

Removing a watermark from wooden furniture , a wood table , wood veneer , or a wood floor is easy . Try and see if you can tell how deep the watermark is in the wood . The color of the watermark stain should give you a clue to how deep it has penetrated into the wood . Below we will show you some tips and tricks to remove the watermark on your wooden furniture or floor for good . <p> How To Remove Watermarks From Wooden Furniture <p> A watermark stain on wood from liquid is mostly always a white or light colored watermark .

Feed it through the exterior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When doing this you will most likely have lint pouring out into the inside of your home . Clean all the lint up and use the toilet snake or plumbing snake once again from the inside to the outside to be sure all lint is removed . <p> If your dryer vent exhaust hose is in bad shape , you may as well order a new dryer vent hose to make this issue never happen again.If you have holes in your dryer vent exhaust hose , then heat is being expelled into your home . If it is summer time , all this is doing is adding heat into your home . Check the vent hose , if it is ripped or has holes , replace it ASAP . Once you clean the vent out and everything is hooked back up , run your dryer for a test . You should have perfect air flow coming out of the exterior vent . We would recommend to do the vent cleaning yourself and save about $150.00 dollars . If you do not have a toilet snake , use a shop-vac with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Replace if ripped or torn <p> Here are a few tricks you can try:On older dryers , there is a pull-out lint screen on top . Pull the lint screen out completely and run the dryer . Add some lint in where the lint screen was and see if it gets pulled in by airflow suction . This indicates the air flow is working properly . <p> If you MUST dry clothes in a rush , remove the vent hose to the dryer and run the dryer . Lint will come out of the vent tube but have a bucket or something to catch it . <p> To check that the dryer is expelling the hot air , use caution and touch the vent hose behind dryer . If it is hot then air flow is flowing . <p> I have a one piece stackable Washer DryerFrigidair . Vent is open and air flow is good . Initial temp of air is 190 ' or so I was told yet it takes multiple drying cycles to dry clothes . Is there a sensor that could be broken . Advice requested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drying , in addition to checking the exhaust vent tube and outside vent one might also clean the duct from the dryer lint filter to the exhaust vent . Unplug the dryer and remove the exhaust vent tube . Remove the back panel of the dryer and the duct cover that leads to the exhaust outlet . Lint and other trash accumulates here and may cause poor performance or a fire . Re-assemble the covers re-attach the exhaust vent tube and plug the dryer back in.

I have to constantly flip them back to ON . What would cause this ? I just moved into an older house and the breakers are old . The breakers in the electrical breaker box are NOT labelled . I am thinking there is a problem with my homes electrical wiring system . I am worried something will overheat and may cause a fire . I have been unplugging things and using less electricity to try and be safe . Is there something that I should test , check , or troubleshoot ? How do I isolate which appliance or wiring issue is causing my electrical problem ? <p> What To Do If A Breaker Keeps Tripping In Your Home <p> A circuit breaker trips off the electrical power flow to protect the circuit from overheating and causing any damage . Find out what appliance ( such as the washer or dryer ) that flips the breaker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the breaker turns off and that should be your indicator . The appliance you are using when the breaker turns off is most likely the one causing your problem . You may be using too many electrical items at once . If you are in the kitchen and using the coffee maker , the microwave , and toaster all at once , it will probably flip the 110V breaker off . There are double pole and single pole breakers . Single are usually for 110V and double are for 220V . <p> Breakers and labeling in breaker box <p> It could also be a fault in an appliance or wiring in the wall . It may be a faulty cord , plug , outlet or even the breaker itself . Begin labeling the breaker box once you know what each breaker controls by turning the breakers off and then taking note what part of the house has lost power . Put a sticker next to the breaker and write down what part of the house that breaker controls . Then fix or replace that cord , plug , outlet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> A normal breaker should be labelled with the circuits it supplies something like downstairs lights or kitchen outlets . If you can identify the electrical items being powered then you can turn them all off . Power them back on until the problem comes back . If this does not work , or if the breaker is labelled RCD , RCBO , GFI , GFCI or has a test button , you should call an electrician to at least diagnose the fault . <p> Faulty Appliance outlets can trip the breaker <p> You may have an overload on a circuit that has devices that cycle on and off such as a refrigerator or A/C system . If that is not the case then the breaker may be defective . You should not replace a lower amp breaker with a higher amp breaker because the wires can melt . <p> A multimeter can help you to determine if electrical components are working properly or notGood tool to have on hand for hundreds of uses ! <p> You may have a bad connection to one of the wall plug outlets . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or brittle . You could take the outlet covers off the ones that are on the breaker that keeps flipping off and see if you have a loose wire . Be sure not to touch a wire to see if it is loose . If a wire is loose , flip off the breaker circuit switch to kill power to the outlet . Then use a screwdriver and tighten the screw holding the wire to secure it . <p> Turn off breaker and check behind outlet for loose wires <p> Why does my panel breaker keep kicking off ? <p> Checking for a Bad Breaker <p> Microwave Tripping The Circuit Breaker ? <p> If the problem is in the breaker box itself , have a professional electrician replace the breaker and check to be sure everything is safe electrically and no hazards are present . <h> Always be sure that the electrical power is turned off before attempting any electrical repairs yourself . <p> If you have more info about what can cause a circuit breaker to keep tripping , please leave a comment below .

Usually behind where a refrigerator is installed , there will be a water valve that you can use to hook cold water to your fridge . If there is no water valve behind your fridge , you will have to run a water line to the closest cold water pipe to get your refrigerator access to water . You may have a cold water pipe either behind the wall where the fridge is or possibly in the floor under the kitchen . You will need to locate where the cold water pipe is , drill to access it , and install a water valve and flexible water tubing . This usually will take an hour and a half or so to complete .

Even if we flush the toilet multiple times it does the same thing and solids do not empty properly . Can you give us some tips and advice ? <p> Toilet Is Not Clogged But Drains Slow <p> The problem is most likely not from your actual toilet . You probably have a partial blockage in the pipe . The easiest way to fix this is to first try a toilet plunger . ( Get this type of plunger as it works better with toilets ) Use the plunger in the toilet and push down and pull up and push down and pull up making sure the plunger has an air seal .

The wax rings purpose is to make an airtight seal between the sewer pipe and the toilet . ( See image above for wax ring location ) This airtight seal makes it so the water leaving the toilet makes a vacuum which pulls any solids down and into the pipe . You can usually tell if the wax ring is not sealing if you smell the odor from the sewer line under the toilet .

These are mostly small objects that are left in the pockets of your clothes such as coins , keys , small socks , pins , paperclips , etc . The drain filter is accessed on the front bottom of the washer and the coin trap is located behind an access panel .

Always try to " balance " out the tub by adding more or less items so one large item of clothes or blankets is not to one side . For example , if you are washing one large towel or blanket , it will be on one side of the washer drum or tub and can cause an imbalance therefore making it so the washer can not drain out the water correctly , by adding in another blanket or towel , the washer has an " even " amount of wash objects in it and can drain out the water therefore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wash articles in the tub . <h> Washing Machine Belt Loose Or Damaged <p> When your washing machine does not get the water out of your clothing , the belt on the pump or motor may be worn or stretched .

This causes wet clothes after a wash cycle is completed . Make sure you check the belt or the direct drive system for wear and tear . Replace the washer drive belt or direct drive motor coupler if worn , cracked , damaged , broken , or stretched . <h> Washing Machine Lid Switch Assembly or Door Lock Switch Assembly <p> Your washer will not drain at all if the the lid switch is faulty .

You may have a thermal overload issue with the motor . <p> Does the Panda dryer stop heating and spinning ? Or keeps spinning but not heating ? Let us know what you find , and please give us the model number of your Panda dryer . -RR <p> I will try this but I highly doubt its overheating . It literally just cycles through the timer way too fast . If I set it to 180 mins its at 0 min in 20 mins or so so I just keep turning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Also there is only a high and low setting so I will try the low and see if that works . As for the heating , it stays warm/hot as long as its not in the cool section of the dial ( 0-20 mins section ) . I will reply soon with the model number and results of putting the dryer on low . How feasible is it to fix the thermal overload motor issue should this be the problem ? <p> Regarding the thermal overload does this mean if the motor gets to hot the unit will shut down even mid cycle ? For example if the dryer still had 40 mins left of drying time would it shut down at that point or would it cycle down to 0 immediately to shut off ? I ask because my dryer never stops mid cycle it stops only when it gets to 0 the issue is just that it arrives at 0 way too quickly and not at the actual time indicated on the dryer . As I mentioned if I set it to 180 mins of dry time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> I have an issue with the PANDA dryer on the xpb36 . Its a brand new panda , but after 3 loads the dryer no longer works .

These LED bulbs are located in the bathroom . There are 4 LED bulbs in total . The incandescent light bulbs never flickered or dimmed by themselves . It seems the LED bulbs will flicker and dim every now and then . I have the LED lights on a dimmer . The LED bulbs dim perfectly with the slider dim switch . The LED lights are brighter and more efficient but the occasional flickering is making me think there is a problem . Can you advise what I can check or do ? <p> Why do LED lights flicker and dim ? <p> Most common reason LED lights flicker:LED light bulbs may flicker or dim in your home when there are voltage fluctuations in your homes wiring . There is an electrical current flowing in the homes wiring and the resistance of each wire uses some of the voltage when other things in your home are switched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your washing machine and the clothes dryer at the same time , this is most likely why you will see an LED light dim or flicker . When electrical loads turn on and off in your home , this change in voltage levels will cause the LED lights to occasionally dim and or flicker . <p> LED light bulb on a Dimmer Switch <p> Surge wattage from appliances in your home : Certain appliances in your home require more power when they initially turn on . The name for this is " surge wattage " . When this happens there is a large drop in voltage . When surge wattage occurs , the power drain can make the LED lights dim or flicker . A solution to this is to put all appliances on separate breakers as this will lessen the surge wattage . The dimming or flickering of LED lights will probably occur no matter what . You may see slight flickering with LED bulbs no matter how your home is wired . <p> Loose wiring or loose LED bulb:You may have a loose connection in the circuit . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fix the problem . If heavy dust is present in the light fixtures , blow out the connection points to remove the dust . There may also be wiring at the connection point that is loose . Disconnect power to the circuit and re-tighten the wiring making sure it is tight and secure . <p> Dimmable LED light bulb <p> LED lights are on dimmers : If you have the LED bulbs on a dimmer switch , you will notice the dimming and flickering MORE if the LED lights are slightly dimmed when surge wattage happens . For example , when your central air conditioner clicks on , you will notice the LED lights dim or flicker slightly because of surge wattage . If you have the dimmer switch all the way up , you may not notice the dimming of the LED lights when surge wattage occurs . <p> Dimmer switch for led lights <p> Dimmer compatibility with LED lights:Some light switch dimmers may not be compatible with all LED lighting .

Buy high quality LED lights that are marked " dimmable " or " compatible " with all dimmer switch types .

@@13196550 @1796550/ <p> How do you fix headphones with sound in only one ear ? The most common fault on a pair of audio headphones is sound only coming from one ear or side . If you have an expensive pair of earphones , replacing them by buying new ones is not always the best option . For headphones or earbuds that cost $50 dollars and above , most people will choose to fix it themselves . For many high end headphones , there is probably a warranty that may still be covering them from defects . Before you attempt to cut any wires or disassemble the headphones , contact the manufacturer first there are links to many headphone companies at the bottom of this page . <p> There can be many reasons that a pair of headphones only play audio out of one ear . The most common reason for sound to only come out of one side is the wires near the audio jack have gotten bent back and forth so many times that it has caused a short in the wiring . To fix your headphones correctly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your local Radio Shack or similar type of electronic store . With the correct tools and materials , you can fix that pair of broken headphones yourself . <p> Headphones Quick Easy Fix : Many times if you twist or bend the wire on the headphones , the sound will work for a very short time . This is a good hint as to where the wire has shorted out . For a super easy quick fix , just apply electrical tape to the wire where it was working when you bent it . Keep bending the wire and when you isolate the shorted part of the wire , add the electrical tape in this area while keeping the wire bent . This will hold the shorted wires together creating a temporary fix to get sound to come out of both ears . Then when you are ready to fix it permanently , read the step by step tutorial below . <p> NOTE : The below headphone repair tutorial is to be done at your own risk . Follow the below step by step DIY procedure only as a last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ headphones , earbuds , earphones , and any other type of audio headset . <p> Step 1 : The first thing to do to fix your headphones yourself is to plug them into an audio source.Step 2 : While audio is playing and you have the headphones on , move your hand up and down the wire and bend it every 1/2 inch to try and isolate where the wires have shorted out.Step 3 : Once you hear sound in BOTH ears , you have found where the wire is not properly connected or has shorted ( most commonly it will be right next to the headphone jack ) . Step 4 : Isolate this area by putting masking tape to the left and right of where the short has been found leaving an inch or so in between the tape.Step 5 : Take the wire cutters and carefully cut the shorted area of the wire out by cutting an inch or so on EACH side of the shorted area of the wire ( since you found the faulted spot on the wire where it has shorted out , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cutting and removing a half inch or so on EACH side of where you found the faulted wire ) . Step 6 : With a pair of wire strippers , strip back the wire shielding on both sides to expose the wires ( there should be 3 different wires , one red , one black or white , and one copper but yours may vary ) . Step 7 : Once the wire shielding is stripped back , you will then strip the exposed wires to reconnect them.Step 8 : Strip back each wire using the wire strippers . If the wire is super small you may need to use sandpaper to expose the wiring underneath ( these are the color wires under the wire covering , the red , black or white , and copper wire , the copper ( ground ) wire will be straight up copper and has no wire covering so you do not need to strip it ) . <p> Step 9 : Once the wires are stripped and exposed ( add the shrink tubing at this step if you are using it ) reconnect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black , etc ) using your method of choice . You can splice them together using any splicing method or use a solder gun . <p> Step 10 : Test the headphones to make sure you are now getting sound from each side.Step 11 : Once everything is working properly , use shrink tubing or electrical tape and wrap it over the repaired area of the wire to further protect it.Congratulations , you have fixed your headphones yourself ! <p> If you have a high end pair of headphones costing over $50 dollars , there is a good chance your broken headphones are still under warranty .

Once you find it you can fix it using the methods above .

If you did not find a bad wire in the headset of your Turtle Beach headphones , then most likely the wiring sound issue is a shorted cord . Usually this occurs right where the cord and the jack connect . The constant bending of the wires shorts out the wire right above the jack . Many times the cord will short out and no sound will be heard in both ears . Sometimes the right side will NOT produce sound or the left side will NOT produce sound . Either way the cord needs fixing by either replacing it or finding the shorted part of the wire and fixing it using the methods above . -RR <p> Kelly , Check the wires where the wiring goes into the headphones on the right side .

Are your headphones bluetooth or does it transmit the sound from a designated transmitter ? -RR <p> Darah , Take it apart and check the receiver portion of the Bluetooth Beats headphones . Check the speakers and wiring inside the headphones . Most likely there is one loose or disconnected wire and soldering it back into place will fix you Bluetooth Beats Headphones . -RR <p> Tom , Try moving the cable that attaches right below the left ear bud to see if there is a possible short in the wire . Usually the issue is at the jack . You may have to strip the wires and reconnect the wiring . -RR <p> I have an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been in use for 2 years . The right earpiece with the mic and controls just stopped working . The controls on the right piece are still working fine except no sound , creating an imbalance effect . <p> I have a pair of Samsung earbuds that came with my moms Galaxy S4 . Since she already had a pair from her previous phone , she let me have the new ones . The left earbud works fine when plugged into a device , but the right earbud , which has a mic/ volume piece on it , does n't  have any sound or even static coming from it at all . HELP ! <p> Drake , You most likely have a shorted wire . The issue may be where the mic is located or down where you plug it into a jack . Put the earbuds on , plug into a source , and slowly bend the wire starting from the very bottom where it plugs into the audio source . Work your way up while bending the wire back and forth . Hopefully you will hear sound in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wire is shorted . You can then either repair it or add electrical tape to where the short is by bending the wire until you HEAR sound , and then tape the wire in place with the wire bent . May look ugly but it works if you are not willing to cut and repair the wire . -RR <p> Elliyo , Do both of the speakers produce NO sound ? You most likely have a break in the wire near the connector where you plug the male part of the wire into the jack . Plug the headphones into an audio source , play audio , then feel from the jack upwards and bend the wire back and forth to find where the break is located . Then mark the wire at that point . You will need to then cut the wire , strip it back an inch above where the break is , and rewire a it with a new male audio input . Let us know what you find . There is a better description of how to do this on the page above . -RR @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scotch tape , masking tape , or duct tape , it will fall off and not work , always use electrical tape . Electrical tape is always the top choice when doing any type of electrical repair on headphones , head sets , or ear buds . -RR <p> Owen , If your head phones are not working properly , such as audio or sound in only one ear , this is usually the sign that you have a bad wire . You may be able to bend the wire until you hear the sound in both head phones , and then apply electrical tape to the wire to hold it in place . However The best method of repairing headphones with sound in only one ear is cutting the wire so you can repair the faulty wire . -RR <p> Brianna , Those types of headphones are made so you can simply replace just the cord since it has a detachable cord . Get a new cord from the exact company that makes them on Amazon and you should have perfectly working headphones . Bose is one company that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cord gets damaged you can simply buy a new cord and you are all set . Here is a pair of one of the best lightweight Bose over ear headphones that have a detachable cord . -RR <p> Pilot , Check the wiring right above the plug for a bad wire . The movement from the plug bending back and forth over and over can cause your headphones to have a short in the wire causing the sound to come out of only one side . -RR <p> I had an old pair of Cyber acoustics headphones with microphones . One side stopped working so I bought another pair . The new pair is n't working either , I only still get sound just on one side . I doubt its the wiring . What else can be wrong . <p> Kat303 , If you have checked the wiring then the issue is in the speaker or the wires that are soldered to the speakers . You can try disassembling the headphones and checking the speakers to see if they are damaged or the wire is loose . -RR <p> I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was recording the sound from the head phones and later sending it back to them repeatedly . An irritating noise . And about 5 minutes later I noticed only the right speaker worked . I have no idea if that noise had something to do with it or if a cable have snapped off over time . <p> Erik , What brand of headphones ? Also is the sound only coming from the right side ? Have you checked to see if the wiring above the jack is causing the issue by bending it back and forth while listening ? -RR <p> Jon , If the sound is coming out of only one side on your Skullcandy headphones , you can rewire them with an affordable kit or buy new . Just do the math and see what makes more financial sense . Usually if a pair of headphones cost over $60 US dollars , it is worth fixing . If worth lower , buy new but buy headphones that have the detachable wire such as Bose headphones . Bose SoundTrue Headphones have the audio wire that comes off . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ working in one or both ears , you simply buy a new audio cord and plug it in. -RR <p> I need your support , I have problem with my Beats Dr. studio headphone wireless but cant find where . It works out the left side wireless only but with the cable plugged in I can listen from both sides . What Can I do to fix it as soon as possible ? <p> Celio , It may be that the wireless broadcaster has an issue . If by plugging in your wireless Beats headphones with the cord both ears work , then there is no wiring issue with the headphones themselves . Check wireless base broadcaster . -RR <p> Alena , Buy a new jack , cut off the old one about 2 inches up the wire , strip the wire , finely solder or use the methods on this page to connect the new wires together . Test to be sure it worked . Then you can use heat shrink tubing or finely wound electrical tape to cover the area . If using heat shrink tubing , put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together . Then when repair is complete , slide the heat tubing over the repaired area and use a hair dryer to shrink the tubing to the area . -RR <p> I have a new pair of Beats by DRE Headphones and I pulled out one of the wires going to the left ear speaker . How do I get this wire back in and connected ? Can I do it myself or should I let a repair company do it ? I have money to buy replacement parts . I just need guidance cuz these BEATS headphones are expensive but awesome . Please guide me on how to fix them . Thank you ! <p> Jim Thomas , When the wires have been forcefully yanked out of the headphone speaker assembly Use a set of eyeglasses screwdrivers or similar small tools and open up the left part of the BEATS headphones to access the speaker . Be careful not to force open the speaker ear assembly or it may crack . Once open , locate where the wires were pulled out . You will need to strip the wires @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the hole and solder the wires onto the speakers terminals . If the wire is too short you will need to buy replacement wires with headphone jack . -RR <p> My earbuds are bent at the bottom of where I connect the part to my phone but before my left one stopped working I 've noticed some glitching of the audio . Then so I stopped using the ear buds for 1 week but then when I tried to listen to music my left side of my ear bud completely stopped working . <p> Tamara , There is a shorted wire going to the left earbud . Put the earbuds in your ears , turn on music , bend the left speaker wire from the very bottom from the plug and slowly going up to where the wire goes into the left earbud . You should hear the music at one point as by bending the wire you will reconnect the broken wire . When you isolate where the wire is broken , bend the speaker wire until you can hear the music and immediately put a piece of tape @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That is a temp fix as it does not look professional . You could get a piece of tape that matches the color of your earbud wires to camouflage the fix . -RR <p> Faith , Bend the wire going to the left speaker all the way up and all the way down . Doing this will help you find the " break " or " shorted " point . Once you find it and you can hold the wire tightly and the music is heard through the left bud , use electrical tape to hold the wire securely in place . -RR <p> I have Beats Pro by Dr.Dre monster edition . Only sound from one ear cup comes through depending on where I insert my 3.5mm Jack ( as beats pro have 2 inserting ports on each ear cup ) Really do n't  have too much of a clue on what to do . Some tips would be really handy bud . <p> Diijay , Whichever ear cup is not producing sound , that cup need to be opened and checked for wiring issue . May also be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some simple troubleshooting to find out for sure . -RR <p> Similar to first commenter , Melanie , I had a pair of Urban Ears Plattens that got into a tussle with a fence . Fence won and the headphones lost their jack everything else is fine . Would a no-solder$ 4.00 1/8 jack replacement from Radio Shack work for me too ? <p> I have a pair of turtle beach px22 , I followed your advice and found the spot in the wire ( the one that comes out of the headphones ) When i striped the outer black covering I have 4 different wires . The red , green , blue ones are thin and i do not believe they cover a smaller wire , and a larger white one that has thin copper wires around it . The white one also has a smaller copper wire running through it . <p> My question is , do i connect the thin wires as they are and strip the wire to connect the smaller copper wire inside it , or do I connect the copper wiring around the white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but I have a pair of over-the-ear headphones whose right speaker is n't working . I 've tried bending the wire from one end to the other several times , and I got no sound . Any other possible fixes ? <p> Kyle , If that is the case , the wire that attaches inside to the actual speaker could have loosened and fallen off . Or possibly the the wire in another part of the headphones is bent , crimped , or broken . We would suggest taking the headphones apart and visually checking the wiring to see if you can find an obvious issue . -RR <p> Panos , If you wiggle the wire just above the plug , does the sound intermittently come back on in the ear that does not work ? If this is the case you can buy a new replacement audio wire and solder to fix . If the cost of your headphones is $40 dollars or less , it may not make financial sense . You can find some cheap replacement audio wire to fix your headphones but it may degrade the sound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was first cutting out AFTER the repair on the right ear IF you jiggled the wire around . Now you say there is NO sound from the right side and the wire has completely detached ? Are you saying the wire is just hanging there as in pulled out of the right ear speaker ? Please explain in detail . <p> Also , if you choose to replace the complete cable , it is not a difficult job if you have the exact cable original OEM part . Is it not possible to find the exact cable ? You should be able to find a high grade replacement that wont cheapen your sound . Many online specialty headphone companies have compatible replacement cables if you can not find the exact one you require . -RR <p> Yes I would agree , if they were cheap then that 's usually the quality too . However saying that expensive ones do get the same issue and the jack is the most common of them . With that in mind try twisting the jack or moving the wiring just above the jack . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jack , or in some cases the wiring just above it . You will then have to justify for yourself if you are going to get a new set or replace the jack . Your choice . If this does not prove to be the issue , either the wiring needs replacing or the left bud has had the wiring pulled off the speaker internally . Partial wire replacement is also possible if the break is below the remote if there is one attached . Its up to you really but that 's your options . <p> First things first Adam . Try a different cable , as I am aware these have a 3.5mm jack port in the headset . By trying a different 3.5mm jacked cable will eliminate the possible chance it has of being that accessory . If you try a different cable and you are still having the same issue then you can try looking at the wiring inside . It could possible be the female 3.5mm jack port which is damaged . These are the 2 possible causes , it is very doubtful it is anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be . <p> I have some special edition ( I think ) Ryback headphones and its the type of headphones with the flat no-tangle wire . How should I fix this , I also cant find the spot where the wire is broken . I noticed that I chew the wire at one place and I checked and I cant seem to find any crackling or hear both ears . Maybe it could be a problem in the headwear part of the headphone ? Please help ! ! ! ! ! <p> Adam , Most likely if both ears are not producing sound , it is the metal 3.5 mm jack that inserts into piece of equipment you want sound from . Your best bet is to purchase the complete wire with jack . You will then have to attach the wire to the ear pieces either by soldering or small screws . You can find replacements on Amazon for 3.5 mm jack with flat no tangle wire . -RR <p> David , You can buy a headphones audio replacement wire kit . Sometimes the wires in the universal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and strip it back and cut it to the length you need . Amazon has headphone repair kits that are relatively inexpensive . -RR <p> Beats are harder to fix like many others are . It may help if they would have said that you need a 4 pole jack not a 3 and " No " they do not have 5 connection points they have 4 which is why they are called 4 pole jacks for 4 connection points . To solder 4 pole jacks you will need to be a bit of a pro . They are not as easy to solder as you may think . The smaller they are the harder they are to fit . <p> As with the wire colors you would need to test these to ensure that you get the right combination , 2 of them will need to be twisted together in some cases headphones or earphones have 5 cores but only use 4 but it was a choice of wiring by the manufacturer . Believe me when I say all makes and even models differ from color to color and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The best way is to test them with proper equipment to find out the correct combination or you could just send them to us . <p> I have a pair of dr dres that does not have the jack end of it , it just has the headphone with a cord that is cut off there are 5 colors green , black , white , yellow , and brown can you please help me with telling me what each color does ? Can any of these colors be doubled up like if they were for each side plus ground ? Thank you in advance . <p> Melanie , Buy a $4.00 1/8 ? jack replacement from Radio Shack , which has small screw connectors that do n't  need soldering . There will be one that will be for 5 wire . Ask the store person if you are unsure . Once you have this you can simply attach the exposed wires to the jack . -RR

@@13196559 @1796559/ <h> Refrigerator Ice Maker Makes Hollow Ice Cubes How To Fix <p> Is your refrigerator ice maker making hollow ice cubes ? Ice cubes sticking together ? If you find that your Samsung , LG , Kenmore , Whirlpool , GE , KitchenAid , or Frigidaire ice maker is making hollow or small ice cubes , this can lead to major problems . At times when the ice maker ejects the ice cubes , the small ice ejectors may break the ice which can split the cubes in half . When this happens , the water in the partially frozen ice cubes can be flung around leaving drops of frozen water inside the freezer and on the ice maker itself . In extreme cases this can cause minor flooding . <p> Ice maker making hollow ice cubes <p> This is a semi common problem with ice makers and it is called " hollow cubes " . You will most likely first find that your ice cubes in the ice bucket are all stuck together . If the ice cubes are stuck in the dispenser and you can hear the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stuck together . If you have small ice cubes , hollow ice cubes , or ice cubes that look like they were cut in half , you will want to troubleshoot this immediately to fix the problem so a larger more serious issue does not develop . <p> FIRST Be sure the water line to the refrigerator is n't kinked or bent . A kinked or bent refrigerator water line will cause the water to flow slowly to the water inlet valve . Also be sure your fridge water filter is replaced every 6 months as a clogged fridge water filter can cause low water flow leading to hollow ice cubes . <p> ICE MAKER HOLLOW ICE CUBES Problem Solution #1:Low Water Pressure Hollow ice cubes can be caused by low water pressure . Low water pressure to the fridge will result in the ice maker filling too slow . This can make it so the ice cube mold does not have enough water in it when it begins to freeze the water to make the ice cubes . Check to be sure the water pressure to the fridge is between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is best . <p> ICE MAKER HOLLOW ICE CUBES Problem Solution #2:Bad Thermostat Another problem that can make your ice maker create hollow cubes is a bad thermostat . A bad thermostat will create hollow ice cubes as it causes it to cycle too soon . The ice maker thermostat is located inside the icemaker itself . You can check the thermostat with a meter . If you find that the thermostat is faulty , remove and replace it . <p> ICE MAKER HOLLOW ICE CUBES Problem Solution #3:Ice Maker or Fridge Not Level If you find that the mold is not completely filled with water , you need to be sure your refrigerator is level . Put a level on top of the fridge and be sure it is level in accordance with your refrigerator owners manual . You could also have an ice maker that was installed wrong and the ice maker itself is not level . Both of these issues can cause the hollow ice problems . <p> ICE MAKER HOLLOW ICE CUBES Problem Solution #4:Water Valve on Wall Clogged or not Fully Open The water valve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can lead to hollow ice cubes from the ice maker . Check this valve to be sure it is fully open and that the screen located inside the valve is not clogged . <p> ICE MAKER HOLLOW ICE CUBES Problem Solution #5:Water Inlet Valve Bad or Ice Maker Water Level Needs Adjusted When the water turns on to fill your ice maker , it fills the end of the ice maker on the other side of the control and motor first . When the water will not fill ALL of the ice cube molds then the mold nearest to the controls and motor is usually partially filled . There is a thermostat that controls and senses the temp of the ice cube mold . This thermostat will close and the ice making cycle will begin . When the ice maker has one or more partially filled ice cubes in the mold , this makes the mold have some cubes completely frozen and others may be hollow with some water still inside of them . To see if this may be your issue , you can look into the mold after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cube molds are all filled with the same amount of water . If you can not see into the ice maker mold , put your finger or an object into the ice cube mold to measure how much water is in the molds . You will usually find one end of the ice cube mold is completely filled and the other side is partially filled if you are getting hollow cubes . You may need to adjust the water level for the icemaker . See your owners manual to change the icemaker water level . If the water level of the ice maker is correct , test the water inlet valve on the back of the fridge with a multimeter to be sure it is working properly and be sure it is not clogged or partially blocked . If the meter test does not check out or the inlet valve is clogged or blocked , remove and replace the water inlet valve . <p> If all the above did not work to fix your problem , you may need to replace the complete ice maker or other parts that go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to $200 US dollars . There are many different new and OEM ice makers and ice maker parts for your refrigerator freezer above . <p> Do you have questions about why your ice maker is not producing full ice cubes , why there are frozen water drops in your freezer , or why the ice maker makes hollow ice cubes ? Please leave your questions below and we will be happy to assist . <p> My ice maker is producing I believe one round of cubes full and normal , then another round of cubes is hollow . The ice maker is about 6 months old . It was fine when it was installed and recently started with this full/hollow production . Still an intake or water line issue or something else ? Makes no sense to me . Water line looks fine also relatively new . <p> The ice cube maker is not filling up all the way . The last 2 slots are completely empty and the next 2 are only partially filled . Some of the cubes come out hollow or only partially formed and they seem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rest are normal size . <p> Renee R , If you are getting hollow ice cubes or the ice cube tray is not filling up with water completely , make sure the refrigerator water filter is not clogged . Replace the water filter for the refrigerator/freezer . <p> If the water filter is not the issue , be sure the water line and water inlet valve are not clogged or blocked . <p> The ice maker itself may have the correct water pressure but the timer mechanism may be faulty .

But instead of water not filling , it just has too much water in the drum ( not draining ) when it shuts down . It also takes longer than it should . For example , when set to a quick wash for 28 minutes , you come back 20 or 30 minutes later and it still says 20 minutes left . Could it just need to be replaced . It is 11+ years old . <p> I have checked all that you suggested on my LG Dishwasher . And no problems .

It continues to dribble with the drum turning for seems like 12 minutes then displays code IE. You have to stop and restart the cycle so it will again repeat the rapid fill / cut back to a dribble routine . I have cleaned the filters and my water pressure ranges from 20 lbs min to 40 lbs max . This machine has done this from day one ( about 5 years old now ) . I had a service technician come out while it was still under warranty . He replaced the fill valve ( did not help ) .

It may be that the room is hotter than outside ( depending on time of day ) . This is usually the case when you come home from work . You may have set your A/C on a higher temperature setting to save money . If that 's the case , you need to open the windows to push out the hot air .

But I can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When I push the button of remote to open the garage , light on the opener start blinking . Only way to open the garage is by using the wall Button . I have Linear garage opener . <p> Hic , You may have an issue with the garage door opener receiving the proper signal to open the door . Either adjust the garage door switches and codes to sync with the remote , buy new battery for remote , or get a new remote . -RR <p> My garage door opener has been slowly dying over the past month . Based on the intensity of the LED in the remote I figured that the remote battery is dying . I 've replaced the A23 battery with a brand new one the remote LED indicates that power is being received , but the garage opener wont respond . Ive attempted to use the learn button on the opener but it wo n't respond to the remote . As a last ditch effort I put in the old battery and it worked again ! Since the old battery will be dead soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? <p> Matt , We would suggest using another remote if you have a second one , getting ANOTHER new battery , or taking it into a home improvement store and buying a replacement remote that will be compatible with your garage door opener . You probably had a bad battery or possibly put it in upside down . Possible ? -RR <p> My garage door worked one day then my son played around in there and it stopped working so the door was open and would n't close and so the movers manually closed it and now I cant open it . I changed the batteries and it still did n't  work . It is a detached garage and there is no other way in . Is there a way I can fix this or do I need to just call someone ? <p> Kristen , The only way that may have happened when your son was in the garage is Either the actual garage door opener switches and or setting were moved or reset . You may need to change the garage door settings and do a complete reset @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Also , the sensors near the bottom door tracks may have been bumped or moved . If they are not aligned correctly the garage door opener may think there is something in the way and for safety reasons it will not close or open in the manner it is designed too . Have a look at the sensors and be sure they are aligned properly . -RR <p> My garage door openers work when I am close to the unit in the garage and when I stand right on the other side of the garage door outside the garage . But they no longer work from any distance beyond 6 inches on the other side of the garage door . I replaced batteries . Issue is the same . Antenna is hanging down about 5-6 inches below the unit but still not working from driveway . <p> Lyn , Be sure antenna is connected and secure . Many times an antenna will become loose and this issue can happen . If the antenna is secure , there may be an issue with the garage door opener itself . How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having an issue with one remote or multiple remotes ? What brand are the remotes and garage door opener ? -RR <p> I had the same problem suddenly my remotes did n't  work unless I was very close to the garage door and sometimes not at all . I finally saw somewhere that LED bulbs can cause interference . I realized I had recently replaced a burned out bulb on the opener with an LED bulb . I removed it and it worked perfectly again . <p> Door will not open with remotes . It first would not work with one then not the other . I replaced the batteries and still nothing . I went inside the garage and hit the button to the remote and the red light on the receiver blinked . the door will go up with the wall mount button . <p> Greg , It sounds as if the code for the remote was somehow reset . Refer to your garage door opener manual and see how to reset the codes for the remotes . There may be switches on the side of your garage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Thank you . We do n't  have a manual and we do n't  even have the cover of the opener ! ! ! ! ! As a matter of fact we are n't  even sure how old it is ! ! ! It came with the house " as is when we bought it . We tried everything we could think of ( TG for you tube ) and tried your suggestions . I think we will just suck it up and get a new one , its at least 8 years old and I really think closer to over 15 ! I do appreciate your suggestions ! Thank you <p> Diane , There is an issue with the garage door opener on the garage ceiling . May have a safety timer or timing issue . Troubleshoot using your manual or a YouTube video . May need a part replaced or possibly new garage door opener . -RR <p> Diane , There are 2 sensors at the bottom of the garage door . One mounted near each track . They point to each other creating an invisible safety line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the door not shutting when light is still on can occur . Here is a video on How to Check Alignment of Garage Door Sensors . -RR <p> My garage door FOB will not work when the garage door opener light is on . If the light is off the key FOB works . When the light is on , ie after opening the door , we are unable to close it using the FOB . If we leave the car , go into the garage and turn off the opener light from the wall mounted remote the key FOB then works . This is a new situation . <p> Diane , Next time it wont close when the light is on , HOLD the wall button depressed . If that closes the door , it is the safety system causing it . Hold the wall button down and this will override the safety system . The safety system thinks it should not close because of misaligned safety sensors . They are easily bumped out of alignment . Make sure they are aligned and try to shut the garage door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not work , turn the dial on the side of your garage opener ( attached to ceiling of garage ) in the direction indicated to increase the closing force of the door . That should fix it . If not then let us know and we can give more suggestions . -RR <p> My remote wont open my chamberlain garage door opener . here 's my situation . I have 2 chamberlain units for 2 separate doors . One works fine . The other will only open using either the wall button or the outside key pad . We can not get a remote to program . We have tried the 3 button remote we have for the other door , which we know works since it will open the other door , but it wont program . I have bought a new remote , which wo n't program . I have replaced the battery in an older remote , which did not work . And my car home button wont program either . I keep reading about interferences with led lights and other electronics , but I know the unit can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is programmed and the other unit works just fine . We have lived in our house for 9 months now and the unit worked up to about 4 months ago and just stopped . What in the works is going on ? <p> Nicole , If none of the remotes you have program . You should be able to change some settings on the garage door opener assembly ( hanging from your garage ceiling ) to renew the codes . There are switches and or lights on the garage door motor assembly that should let you change the settings and all should work after that once you reprogram your remotes . So , if all your remotes do not work , then more than likely the settings on the garage door opener motor assembly has been possibly changed or mistakenly altered and needs to be reset and or changed . Reset or change the settings on the garage door motor assembly , then reprogram your handheld remotes and everything SHOULD work . -RR <p> Kurt , Please supply us with the make and model of your garage door opener . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the opener itself ? There should be a number of switches . Consult your owners manual since we do not know what make your garage door opener is. -RR

Is the screen damaged or cracked ? If the screen is not cracked , you can try replacing one of the boards . Many times a circuit board will not work because of a popped cap .

If you believe the TV was left on pause with an image on the screen and it " burnt " a permanent image , patches of grey , or lines this may be what has happened .

If you turn the TV on it may damage the screen permanently . Let it sit for a few days to dry . <p> The only issue is that the substance that was spilled was soda .

You may need to open the TV and remove the residue to be sure there is nothing left in the TV when you turn it back on . <p> The TV may be permanently damaged depending on how long you left it on after the spill occured. -RR <p> My Toshiba LCD 37 INCH has horizontal lines and frozen when cold .

It has only 1 vertical thin gray or white line in the right panel and after a day it adds another vertical line . Now it has 3 lines . What could may possibly the cause of this . Is it the t-con or some of the capacitors ? No fracture for the LED panel . <p> Chris , If your LG TV does NOT have a cracked or indented screen , you may have loose ribbon connectors/wire harnesses in the TV that connect the circuit boards . Be sure everything is secure . While looking , check if you have any burnt or scorched boards and if any of the small capacitors are popped or bulging . If everything is secure and no visible signs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fried or possibly the TV screen itself is bad or has become defective . Be careful when opening up the TV as some components can still hold voltage . -RR <p> My 46 ? LED Toshiba has horizontal lines on about bottom 4 ? running across left to right . Also , about the same height on top of that region I can see some fresh new lines are starting to appear . Depending on the color on the screen the lines appear to be very bad and sometime with dark colors they do not look that bad ( still not good though ) . I do n't  know what might have caused that , but after reading comments here I feel like I might have done some dumb thing . Sometime I used wipe screen edges with wet paper towel ( not too wet though ) to clean dust accumulations . I wonder if the screen has gone bad ? I saw a youtube video where a person sprayed a radioshack cooler spray on the edges to repair horizontal lines . I am thinking how that works ? Any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nathan , Yes wiping down an LED TV screen with too much cleaner near the edges can damage the screen . If there is no actual physical damage to the screen that you can see , and no indentations , then possibly getting the screen edges did not damage it . The issue may be with a board or cap in the TV . Possibly bad or loose ribbon cables . Do you think the wet paper towels liquid may have gotten down in between the screen and the frame ? Are the lines near the edges , corners of the screen ? Did this issue occur right after you cleaned the screen with wet paper towels ? -RR <p> Thanks for your response . I never thought of paper towel thing until I saw a guy on youtube demonstrate fixing such issue by spraying component cooler . I still do n't  understand how that will fix something like that . So , I guess the liquid might have sopped through the edge and damaged the screen . The lines go from one end to the other end and is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the next 4 inches . So , yes they are on the bottom corners and bottom edge mostly . I do n't  think the issue occurred right after cleaning with paper towel . <p> My Samsung 46d8000 shows thin vertical lines on the left of the screen . This lines are barely visible during a movie , not visible when the screen is black , very annoying during football match . This semi transparent colored lines ( red , blue , white ) are shown every time , with all source . <p> Kriminal , With some Samsung TVs you can try tapping near the input where the component is connected such as an HDMI input . If this clears the lines you most likely have a loose component such as a ribbon cable loose . If this is not the case , you may have a bad screen or possible popped caps , bad board , etc . Is the screen physically damaged in any way ? -RR <p> My TV ( Vizio XV471XVT ) after 6 hours the screen randomly goes white and it has vertical and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is still on but screen looks white with lines also when I push on the screen it goes back to normal then 10 secs later then it goes right back to the white lines . <p> How do i tell if i have bad t con board vs a bad panel ? Vertical bar shows on one side of my screen . After it was taken apart i found a blueish residue on the ic board that feeds directly to the lcd panel . I am assuming it was corresion . Just do n't  know how to tell if it shorted out the tcon board or is its the whole panel . <p> Kevin , Try switching the ribbon cables if that will prove if either the board or cables are bad . If you use new ribbon cables , get the correct length . If you are using ribbon cables already in the TV , you may run into one too short and one too long . Also the ribbon connector ends may not be the same for all boards so be aware . -RR <p> I have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hours , all of a sudden I notice very thin black horizontal lines on the left half of the screen . They start pretty noticeable all the way to the left then gradually fade until they disappear halfway in the screen . When I change the input or channel they are still there . They show up over the menu and everything . Not really sure what it could be . <p> Stephan , Try this disconnect the set from AC power , then press and hold the power button on the TV itself not the remote control for 20 seconds . After another few minutes , plug the set back in and press power once . Do you still have the same problem ? The thin lines on the screen are common when capacitors on the power supply board are failing , causing one of the outputs to drop in voltage . Open the TV and check the boards for popped or blown caps . -RR <p> I have a Sony Bravia KDL 40EX520 40inch LED TV that i bought in 2012 . Randomly the other night while we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appeared at the top of the screen . The TV has not been dropped , hit or damaged in any way . Sony tells me the entire Screen needs to be replaced and there is nothing else that can be done . Theyve also informed be that the part costs more than a new TV so i should just throw away the TV and get a new one ? ? ? Is this really possible ? <p> My Toshiba does that while playing DVDs . It will correct itself sometimes , other times if I run the DVD disc lens cleaner thru it . Not while on regular TV . The TV is less than a year old . Could it be they are running their TV thru a DVR connected to the DVD and its picking up its signal ? <p> I have an LG 50 ? TV , it has horizontal lines going across end to end . Starting about 7 inches or so from the top . I have pulled the ribbon cable from the left side from the board going to the screen . Then powered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side has vertical lines top to bottom . <p> My 4 year old found a spray bottle and went a little trigger happy on my Samsung model Un50j6200afxza . I did n't  notice it until later but now there is a vertical ghosting effect about 5 inches wide just to the right of the center of the screen . I also noticed a high pitched hum from the bottom left vents under the screen . The TV is wall mounted and I cant tell where the water got into , but the are not any visual clues that there was any entry on the back . I can see residue on the front screen but he couldve sprayed into the vents . Where should I start ? <p> Aaron , We have seen this before and if the water HAS gone into the vents then a board could have shorted or similar . We have also seen this happen where the screen was sprayed with pure water and putting a fan near the TV to dry it out for about 3 days fixed it . If it was pure water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if there was any soap or cleaner in the spray bottle it may leave marks in on around the screen . Try letting it dry our first . if after 3 days or so it is still the same , get back to us with what the TV is doing at that time . -RR <p> Same thing happened to my TV . My 3 year old sprayed my TV and then shortly after a 5 inch vertical line appeared just left of center ( if your looking at the TV ) . I have a 47lm6700 . Is there any hope that this will fix itself by drying ? <p> Kevin , Yes it may be possible it needs to completely dry out , but it needs to be turned OFF ASAP . If the TV was sprayed with water , and the TV has been left ON , the screen is most likely bad . <p> If your TV screen gets wet , it is best to TURN IT OFF ASAP and let it sit for a few days to dry out . If the TV is still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will short out a component , circuit board , screen , wiring , etc -RR <p> How would i know the screen is damaged ? The tv is currently taken apart and from what i can tell the screen is fine . At times the bar will disappear for a quick second but come back . This makes me think its not the screen . I 've clear the ends of the ribbon cables , that did not help . I am think of replacing the control panel . Any other suggestions ? Also how to I access the panels on the bottom edge of the tv ? <p> I figured out how to remove the bottom bezel and found some corrosion on the circuit board ( not sure if that 's what its called ) that connects to the screen . Would you say the problem with the screen or could it possible be the main board ? <p> There was white/blue residue on a board that was located at the bottom of the led screen . The board was a half inch wide and a foot long and fed directly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the main board or not but there were two of them one for each side of the tv . <p> Werner , Is there any sign of damage to the screen on your Samsung TV ? Have you tried tapping on the screen while the TV is on and see if the vertical lines change , move , or disappear ? If so there may be either a bad board , loose ribbon connectors , popped capacitors , etc . A bad Samsung TV UD46A t-con board will cause vertical lines , so if you find no other issues , then replace the t-con board . -RR <p> My TCL smart TV has about a 3 inches of black horizontal lines in the right side of its screen . It happened when my daughter hit it with a ball below the edge of the screen . Could you please suggest a DIY before any technician with the cost of its repair . <p> I have a 24 inches Toshiba LCD monitor and once in a while , a red line vertically is across the screen . At first , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the screen gently and it disappears ! But its becoming stubborn .. What 's wrong with it ? What do i do ? <p> Salia Salifu , If you have a vertical line on the screen its the LCD screen failing . It can not be fixed and the screen has to be replaced . Most likely you 'll get more lines in the future . Find a replacement screen online as LCD screens are getting cheaper . -RR <p> I have a Sony KDL-46W4000 TV and just recently thin black vertical lines have appeared . They start off thick then reduce down to about 1mm wide on both the far left and right side of the screen . On the right side there is also a red/green line . There are two lines on each side of the screen . Any ideas as to what the problem may be ? Is it costly to repair ? The lines are only there when the TV is powered on , at no other time are they visible . <p> Victor Adorno , Vertical transparent lines on a TV usually indicates a bad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the TV to see if maybe something is loose . When you tap do the lines move or change ? -RR <p> I got a DMTECH LT26XT LCD TV which ran smoothly without any problems , but when i got home after work it had weird colored horizontal lines all the way across the screen , i tried to restart it a couple of time , but with no luck . This is constant and the colors change slowly , anything you could recommend here ? = Great service ! <p> Kasper , If your LCD TV has colored horizontal lines on the screen , one of the boards in the TV may be causing the problem . Have a look in the TV to see if you find a burnt board , popped capacitor , or other obvious sign of a problem . -RR <p> Hello again ! I 've checked it through , and it dosent look like anything burned , popped or smelted , neither can I smell anything burned . I 've tried to look for loose connectors , but i 'm not that technical : ( . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ screen is most likely at fault . Check to see if it is worth replacing the screen or getting a new TV . You could still have an issue with a board . If you have the ability to use a multi-meter , test the board or boards to see if there is a fault . -RR <p> I have a Samsung 46D5500 LED TV more than 4 yrs old . The last 10-15 days it is starting with horizontal lines on screen which goes after 5-10 minutes . I was struggling with it . Now I am getting in between running TV horizontal lines some times . Can you please look into it . <p> Harish , If your Samsung TV 46D5500 LED is getting both vertical lines and horizontal lines , that usually indicates a bad or cracked screen . Can you inspect the screen for damage or any part of the screen that is pushed inward ? If the screen is not damaged or cracked , you may have some loose ribbon connectors in the TV or possibly a bad board or 2 which is causing both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -RR <p> I have a Sony Bravia Ex41 Edge LED .

I never thought the screen could turn up like that because I have been using the TV diligently . <p> Cynthia , First check the input cables to be sure they are not damaged and causing the vertical lines on your Sony TV . Vertical lines usually appear if the screen has been damaged OR a circuit board ribbon cable may be loose OR a board is bad in the TV and needs replaced . -RR <p> I have a LG TV model No : 32LH35FR manufactured Jan 2010 , when the TV switched on a white uninterrupted horizontal line runs form one end to the other end at the top of screen .

Could this be a sign that the picture tube is going ? <p> Clint , Is your Panasonic TV LED , LCD , PLASMA , or the old style that uses a powerful lamp ? Can you supply us with the model number ? If you have a thin vertical line on your screen , it could be a number of things Supply us with model number and we can go from there . -RR <p> Emmanuel , When vertical lines appear on the TV screen , identify the cause by testing the TV picture , checking cable connections , and making sure external devices are working properly . Here is the LG TV guide how to do a picture test @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ causing it . -RR <p> I have a TCL 48 ? Roku Flat screen TV that I laid flat on the table , screen side down . I was out of town and when I returned I set the TV upright and turned it on . The TV has a wide black gap line about 2/3 of the way across it . It also has a white line extending left from bottom of black gap/line to the edge of the screen . What have i done ? What can be done ? <p> Steve Cluck , Weight may have been pushed down on the back of the TV when you put it on the table with screen facing down . Is there any visible damage to the front of the TV or the back of the TV ? You may have a board issue if the screen is showing wide black gaps . Open the TV and see what you can find . There may be obvious signs of damage . If not , look for loose or damaged ribbon connectors. -RR <p> Shiva , If the screen on your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the screen will need to be replaced . If the vertical lines on your TV are there and the screen is not cracked Vertical lines on a TV screen are commonly caused by a bad T-Con board . Remove the back of your TV and to check the boards for any signs of damage . -RR <p> I have vertical lines going through my TV , they are colourful when the screen is on , but they are also visible when the TV is off . Not in colour , obviously , but the part of the screen that shows the vertical lines , also looks different from the rest of the screen when the power is off . Would this suggest some sort of impact damage ? It does n't  look like it has been impact or cracked . It does n't  seem to be getting worse , but I 'm trying to decide whether to take it into repair or bite the bullet and replace it . <p> Daniel , Usually if a TV has vertical lines showing and the screen is not cracked or has been impacted When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the TCON card or a fuse or cap blown on a board . Be careful , but troubleshoot in the TV and you may find it to be just a cap that is blown or popped . <p> ALSO Try unplugging the TV . Try different inputs ( HDMI , component , etc . ) Use different cables to be sure it is not an external component causing the issue . -RR <p> The reason I have n't replied yet is that I have n't yet had an opportunity to crack it open and have a fiddle around . The lines are definitely visible when the TV is off . Its this delamination something I can rectify myself ? <p> Thanks for your helpful replies . The reason I had not yet responded is that I had n't  yet managed the time to break open the TV set and have a look at the condition of the insides . The marks are definitely visible when the unit if turned off . I delamination a problem I can fix myself or is it a major issue ? It does n't  seem to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TV . When I turn it on the top 2/3 of the TV is perfectly fine . The remaining 1/3 on the bottom starts off pitch black . After a minute or so , the black horizontal line starts changing into colored vertical lines only on the part that was previously black . When watching , the lines change colors depending on what I 'm watching . I have tried switching inputs and it is still the same . When I click on menu the black/colored lines appear over the menu . The screen is not cracked or damaged in any way . Has never been dropped or handled roughly . <p> I have a Vizio 50 ? 3D smart TV . The first problem started with a black line occasionally flashing horizontally through the picture . Then it started making the bottom half of the screen go darker when it would flash on . Eventually about 3-4 lines , from middle up , started showing up and bottom still getting dark but happening more frequently . Now its to the point of almost constantly flashing every few seconds but now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> I have a Samsung 55 ? LCD that 's about 6 years old . It has a black vertical line right down the center that goes away after its been on a while . Weve lived with it for a year or so , but now we have another issue with horizontal lines that appear after its been on a while . Before we buy a new TV , I thought I 'd see if there is any hope in fixing it . My husband is an engineer and is very handy , but he does n't  have a lot of time , and has n't  tried to diagnose it yet . If its as simple as replacing something , he can probably do it , but only if it will buy us a few more years . = <p> Kelli , If you have both horizontal and vertical lines on your Samsung TV , the problem is most likely the screen . Is the screen cracked or indented ? If not you may have a circuit board or multiple circuit boards that are bad . You can open the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look right . You can replace the caps or the complete board . Look for loose or damaged ribbon connectors . However if you have both vert and horizontal lines , you most likely have multiple issues and it MAY NOT be worth fixing . -RR <p> I have a Sony Bravia kdl-52vl150 . A couple of months ago it started having a thin red line vertical middle right of screen . About a weeks ago , when power on there are vertical lines just above and below the Bravia logo . When hitting menu , the screen has different colored lines , can barely read the menu . To the right of the screen , menu is perfect white on black . If you turn on off a few times the screen will appear perfect ( no thin red line ) . A few times the colored lines would disappear after leaving tv on a few minutes . I installed latest firmware , did n't  help . Yesterday , tv started perfect , but all hdmi inputs had perfect picture , but no sound . Component input worked perfect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plugged sound cable and hdmi sound works again . I turned tv off and this morning , when powering on , the colored vertical lines are back . After turning it off and on about 10 times I got a picture w. sound , but there is a 3 ? horizontal band on the upper portion of the screen that is lighter than the rest . With these symptoms , is it the tcon or something else ? <p> Please help ! ! ! I have a Samsung flat screen . Picture quality is awesome for about 10-15 minutes , then white translucent vertical lines starts showing up . It starts out slow then after about a minute they increase until the whole screen is this translucent white . What can be done to repair this problem please . <p> Shantel , The issue with your Samsung TV could be caused by a bad inverter , bad ccfl , etc . You may also have bad capacitors on the main board . Check the main board and check the capacitors for bulging . -RR <p> I have a Sony KDL-52W5100 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left slightly starts at the bottom and goes up only half way vertically . No physical damage is visible . Just about 1/4 inch thick a tapers to a point close to the center of the screen . Any thoughts on what would cause that ? Is the panel bad ? <p> -RR No , it does n't  seem to change color , I can see the back light . I do n't  know if something got in contact with the screen . I turned it on one day and that 's what I saw . Funny part is I saw a comment from someone saying go over the light with your finger and that will take care of it . Well it did n't  but I has gotten much narrower . Very odd . Is this a lamination issue ? <p> I bought a 42 inch Vizio HDTV , not certain of or where the model number is located , secondhand .

I have tried changing its C1 and SD board but no luck . Last year , I even replaced its SC board so I am hoping that should be fine . So I believe that the problem could be with the A board or could it be something else ? ? I highly appreciate any valuable suggestions . Thanks ! <p> I have a 50inch LED vizio model number e50-c1 . I came home from work and turned on the tv and saw there was a half inch thick Green vertical line all the way down the middle of screen from top to bottom , there also appears to be a horizontal ghosting on the bottom 1/3 of the screen which looks like its repeating the top half of the screen . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

I tried everything in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helps . I have taken the back panel off and exposed the whole back of the TV . Any tips on what I can do from here to get rid of this problem without scrapping my TV ? <p> Denis , Check to be sure there are no popped caps on any of the circuit boards in your LG TV . Also check for any loose or burnt board and ribbon cables in the TV . Vertical lines on a TV usually indicate an issue with the screen and not an internal part , however , a board or loose component could be causing it . Has the TV ever been struck or hit ? No visible damage to the screen ? -RR <p> When the screen is black there are red vertical lines on the left side of the screen and green vertical lines in the middle . When there is a picture ( actually watching TV ) it can change a bit-always vertical lines but colors and placement can change and they often take up the whole screen or make the screen look " foggy " . Any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 40PB200E LED TV that has a few black thin vertical lines . The lines started appearing a couple of months ago . They come and go , but they are becoming increasingly permanent . These lines appear even when the TV is not connected to an input . If I press the menu button , the lines appear above the menu dialog . By the way , the TV is not damaged in any way . I rotate it fairly often to face the direction where I am seating , but have never dropped it or anything . <p> Kelvin , The thin vertical lines can appear after the unit has been on its face or laid down on its back . It can gradually go away , but if the panel was affected by the electronics behind it the damage may be permanent . Has your TV been laid down or moved recently ? If the problem has come about by itself , it may be that the screen is damaged and causing the lines . How old is your Toshiba TV ? -RR <p> My TV is nearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it down since I bought it , excluding the minor rotating I do on a daily basis . The problem started a few months ago . The lines come and go . Usually there will be 3-4 lines when I turn it on . Over time , a few of the line may disappear , or reappear . If I am lucky , there may be NO lines but that usually does not last more than an hour . I heard that vertical lines may be due to poor connection on the t-con board . Do you think I should open up the TV and reconnect some of the ribbon connectors ? If is a screen problem as you suspect , I guess I am out of luck . Although I am not sure how that happened since I have not dropped it or even moved it significantly . <p> Kelvin , Try opening up the TV safely and check all connections . If you find something loose , damaged , or burnt , replace or tighten . Check and recheck all ribbon cable connections . The t-con can cause @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the components with a meter if you understand how . If you have no luck the issue is most likely the screen . -RR <p> Wes , Was the Vizio screen hit or has the TV fallen over ? If the screen is not damaged , then you may have an internal board that is causing your issue . You can look for bulging capacitors or loose ribbon cables on the boards inside the TV . Unplug the TV before you attempt to open it to complete further troubleshooting. -RR <p> I was out of town for 3 days and came home with horizontal lines on my 50 ? Samsung . The picture looks like it has shifted . The bottom inch of the picture should actually be at the top if that makes sense . Odd that this happened because it was fine when we left and not anymore . Please advise if there is a DIY idea or like the Geek Squad has said " just buy a new TV . " <p> Brian , If the screen is damaged , then buying a new TV makes more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the TV causing the image to be distorted , replacing a bad board can cost as little as $30 US dollars and your TV is fixed . You will have to troubleshoot the TV internally to be sure which board is causing the issue . You may have a voltage inverter issue , possible t-con board problem , or another board causing the problem . -RR <p> My Samsung model LE40D550K1W TV is showing horizontal lines at the top of my TV screen , the lines are there all the time no matter which input you use . Its roughly about the the top 1/8 of the screen , the lines flicker and seem to mirror what 's happening in the bottom half of the screen . <p> Andy , Horizontal lines usually indicates a defective screen . The screen on your Samsung TV most likely needs to be replaced . Does this issue happen all the time ? What happens if you leave the TV on for a long period of time ? -RR <p> Yeah its all the time even after its been on a while , it appeared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again but last week I turned it on and it came back maybe worse . Thank you for your reply <p> I have a just over 2 year old ( of course like 60 days past the 2 year warranty ) TCL L40FHDF12TA ( 40 ? LCD ) that recently started getting odd rolling horizontal screen stripes . It starts with horizontal stripes that move and grow . Sometimes they just flash and go away . Other times they stay and grow and roll . They are colored and often the video will freeze on parts of the screen when they are present . Sometimes just the top few inches is affected , and other times the whole screen is frozen and discolored except for a small horizontal stripe . The odd part is that it has gone away completely at times and can come back in moments or hours . I 've watched entire movies and not had any problems , and then the next night tried to watch a 30 minute sitcom , and had to turn it off because it was unwatchable . <p> The audio is unaffected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was HDMI related , so I tried several different cables and inputs with no changes . Watching regular TV ( via the coax input ) exhibits the same behavior . Even if I have the TVs menu up , they are affected as well . This makes me think it is NOT a signal problem , but something deeper and nastier . <p> It is unpredictable and does n't  seem to matter if the TV is warm or cold . <p> Brett OConnell , Horizontal lines usually indicates a defective screen . You can try opening up the TV safely and checking to be sure all ribbon cables are connected secure and that all the boards are visually okay by checking the caps and looking for burnt marks . If all looks okay , then most likely you have a faulty screen . -RR <p> I have a 60 ? Sharp Aquos with horizontal lines that move from top to bottom . After the TV warms up it goes black with a green area , then picture comes back with the lines . I can see a picture but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the t-con board and 1 of the connector ribbons is humming when plugged in . Could that be the problem or is it a bad screen ? <p> I was hoping you could help me find the problem and best solution . I have a Samsung TV and I 'm not sure whether water has somehow got into one of the bottom corners of the screen and causing some issues . But there is a black mark in the bottom left hand corner , roughly 1.5cm in diameter , Then leading up from there are vertical lines which span to the top of the screen . Meaning I have around 4 full columns of pixels that do n't  seem to be working properly . Some times the lines disappear altogether and the TV looks fine ! I left a youtube video on which supposedly fixes dead/stuck pixels for around 2 hours ( the video very quickly alternates between red , blue and green to " Massage stuck pixels " ) and now I have a brown stain leading across the bottom of the screen , not very high but around 4-5cm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaking inside the screen and then is some sort of reaction occurring , causing the pixels in those 4 columns to behave irregular , and if so , would using the youtube video again help or hinder the screen ? <p> Ceri , Is your Samsung TV a Plasma ? If so the plasma gas is most likely causing the screen to become distorted or color issues . What is the model number of your Samsung TV ? Do you believe the YouTube video fixed your dead pixels or made it worse ? What video on YouTube claims to fix dead pixels on your TV ? -RR <p> I have a Toshiba Regza . About 3/4 of the right side is a little more grey than the left as if someone had dimmed the brightness just a bit . There is a slight thin line that separates the left and right . The line is not straight up and down but appears to be back and forth from top to bottom . What do you think ? <p> I have a Vizio model # M650VSE which has a very thin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They sometimes become more narrow as the display is left on and they also react ever so slightly to pressure . If I position the line between my hands and bend the top of the screen ever so gently , the lines dance around a little bit . I 've already replaced the t-con board to no affect as well . I have yet to try cleaning the contacts but I believe that I did attempt to reseat them already when replacing the aforementioned t-con board . Also , the lines are slightly colored but mostly black and the whole segment is approximately 1/4 ? wide . <p> James , May be a screen issue if the t-con did not fix the issue . Have you examined the screen to be sure it is not damaged in the left area ? Do the lines only show on the left side of the TV never on the right side ? When you had the TV opened to replace the t-con board , did you examine all other boards and connections to be sure everything is secure and no caps were popped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flat screen TV and it has a horizontal thick line keep showing up on the middle left side , picture stills shows great its just this line that keeps popping up sometimes its colorful , royal blue , black then white . What 's is going on ? <p> Chastity , Try putting the TV input on to another media device to be sure it is not the TV causing the horizontal line . You could also have a faulty HDMI cable or other causing the issue . Is the screen cracked that you can see ? -RR <p> I 'm starting to work on a Vizio E500i-B1 . The picture quality is still good , but the bottom half of the lcd is a few shades darker than the top . I bring up the menu , and I can still see the difference in brightness over the menu . Would a bad TCON cause this ? Or would it be the panel ? Thank you . <p> Jonathan , Could be either . You will have to see if the screen is damaged first . If not , it could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you see on the TV , and does it vary when the TV is on for a period of time ? -RR <p> The screen does not appear to be damaged . The top 50% of the screen is one solid brightness . The bottom 50% looks like someone just turned a brightness knob a few notches lower . They do n't  fade from one to the other . Someone told me the LED backlight may be going bad . I would post a photo if I could . What 's your opinion ? <p> Jonathan , Could be the LED backlight , you need to take it apart to see . Is the screen defect exactly 50/50 right through the center of the screen horizontally ? Could be a t-con if so but further troubleshooting is needed . Visually inspect inside the TV with caution , you may see something obvious or a popped cap , loose ribbon cable , etc -RR <p> I have Toshiba LCD TV ( 6 months old ) Model 40L2400VM , after using my external hard disc to play mp4 movie , there a green @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ damage on the screen . What should I do ? Any tips ? <p> May , Does the green horizontal line only appear when you are using an external hard drive to watch TV ? Try different inputs of the TV to be sure it is not the TV . Most likely it is an issue with the connection of the hard drive to the TV. -RR <p> I have a Samsung 55 ' model number ln55c630 the screen works fine , but there are black lines on the screen presented horizontally as if the screen is not lit where the lines are . I looked up videos on how to fix it , but I could n't figure out what it could be . could you please help screen does n't  appear to be damaged . <p> I kind of have the same problem . My display shows colored horizontal lines on the left side that fades into the right side of the screen . <p> Tried some warranty-killer-guides online that got me to play around with tape on parts of the screen connectors that controls the two sides of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problem at first but then i ended up getting more horizontal lines along with huge chunks of black vertical lines . <p> I have enjoyed the video you posted and read through many of the comments and feedback . I am hoping that you can help me with the problem I am facing . I have looked up several trouble shooting topics online , but none seem to exactly match the issue with my screen . I am working with a 47 ' vizio that is about 5-6 years old . One day , when I turned the tv on , there appeared vertical white lines on the screen . The lines are about 3-4 inches wide and are not opaque . Instead , they are made up of many thin white lines in that 3-4 in space . They blink and fade and travel wherever an image is displayed on the screen from the vizio logo in the center , to the tv menu on the right . They are only displayed over the image/picture . They seem translucent , but that may only be because it is many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am willing to send pictures . I 'd appreciate any guidance you are willing to provide . Thank you ! ! ! <p> Jay , Test the picture using multiple devices connected to your TV . If you first see the line while watching cable TV then try another input . The point is you want to look at the picture form at least two devices connected to the TV . Check to see if the line is visible when using other devices . If the line is only visible when using one device then the problem is coming from whatever device is connected when you see the line . If the line is visible on multiple devices connected to the TV then the problem is likely a panel line defect . -RR <p> I have a Samsung 3D Smart TV UN46D6420 , and I getting Horizontal line about 4mm apart from each other throughout the screen on all inputs . I noticed the left side heating up a bit more and the left side has noticeably got a bit lighter in brightness too . No physical damage at all , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TV is almost 5 years old , any tips ? ? <p> Joshua C , Most likely it is a board overheating in the TV and the heat is hot enough to affect the TV screen . If the screen has NO DAMAGE whatsoever , then check to be sure a board is not causing the issue as it sounds like you have an overheating/thermal issue . -RR <p> I have a LG 55LX6500 3D TV . Its like 3 years old and suddenly stopped showing display , it shows fine vertical lines on the right side . I tried replacing the T-Con board but that did n't  fix the issue . I want to know if the problem is with the main board or power board . Any help would be appreciated . <p> Sivakumar Sridaran , If the t-con made no difference , try replacing the main board as the power board supplies power , the main board is the likely to cause the issues you have explained . If you replace it , please let us know the outcome . The screen is not cracked , correct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the middle horizontally then vertical lines appeared the sound still works and the lines concurs with what 's playing its a Samsung 55 inch flat screen not even 3 years old we tried disconnecting checks the inputs any help ? <p> Mitch , Usually a red line on the TV means you have something that has gone bad on one of the boards inside the TV . Open the TV up and check the capacitors to be sure they have not popped or have burst . -RR <p> I have a LG LED model 42LN5400 with vertical lines across the entire screen . The lines are there with nothing but power connected . I have already replaced the T-Con board but no luck . All ribbon cables are tight . Bad screen or can I try something else ? <p> Samsung LN-T5281F 52 inch LED tv . Problem : Works perfectly for several hours , then the top 1/3 screen image flickers semi-transparently over the bottom 1/3 of the screen . Most noticeable with white text . Only lasts a few seconds , then works perfectly again . Also , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a brief second and return to normal operation . I replaced the dimming board . Determined it to be bad by using freeze spray and heat . The new board fixed the problem for about two weeks . Now , same problem is back . Im left with power supply , main board and T-Con board to replace next . Will the T-con board cause this ? I will look at all the connections on the dimming board , just to be sure . Screen has never been hit , or even touched lightly . Picture is absolutely awesome , bright and sharp when its not flickering . I appreciate any help . <p> T. Layton , May be a number of things since the TV is showing different problems . If everything worked perfectly for 2 weeks , check to see if a cap blew on the board you replaced . Check ribbon cables to be sure they are secure . Have a look at the other boards for any obvious signs of damage . If the TV works great for a few hours , something may be overheating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Check as stated and let us know what you find . -RR <p> I have a Vizio 32 ? flat screen TV white horizontal lines appear about 6 ? apart and float upward . It dose not do it all the time , some times very bad . Some times it will go for several days with a problem and then they reappear . <p> John , If the lines only sometimes appear , it may be bad caps on a board . Once the TV is on for some time does the TV fix itself ? The issue you may be having is a bad capacitor on a board or boards . You may need to open the TV up and check visually for a bad cap . -RR <p> I have a 46 in LG LED flat screen . It is a couple years old . Never been moved , dropped , hit , or damaged whatsoever . It works fine when there is no movement . I live in apartment 2nd floor and when anything is barely bumped like a table or counter or when we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flash on screen , but they go away immediately . I am concerned that this could become permanent . Regular cable box and PS3 connected to watch blue ray . Checked cables and all good connections . Any recommendations ? <p> Tino , You most likely have a loose ribbon cable in the TV itself . Either that or the display board may have a loose component . Safely open the TV and check to be sure all ribbon cables and boards are connected securely . -RR <p> I have a 3 yr. old LG LED/Plasma 42 ? that developed vertical interference lines on the right side soon after I bought it . I tend to work on the computer with the TV on and so the lines did n't  bother me much since I was basically listening and not watching but they got worse and that did bother me so bought another TV after Best Buy said this one was not worth repairing . After spending over $800 and only used 3 years I am not happy . Thought I 'd try to sell it because the picture was awesome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lines and it barely showed any lines for a whole day so am thinking there might actually be a fix . It has never been damaged since in my home , does not have image burn , just the interference lines and I have left it on pause but tried to not do so very long . Do you have any suggestions ? <p> 55 ? Vizio LCD smart HDTV 3.5 years old , no physical contact with any object , HIGH usage . Today it starts with thin horizontal lines that originate about 3 inches from top of screen and go the width of the screen and are across all inputs . The top 2 lines are pretty solid , below those they become flickery and go to the bottom of the screen . The flickering discolors the image . The lines are black and white flickery . The top 3 ? remains unchanged . It goes to normal for a few seconds to lightly flickery to mostly flickery untill finally the screen goes black . Audio is still intact . Tried factory reset , turning it off for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ None . The back left panel appears to be bowed out where the rest of the panel is flat . I am unsure if that 's how it came . That 's the only visible deformity . And dust in the back vents . That 's been resolved with no change in the flickery . I read somewhere else a technical tap might help as this is a Walmart special type vizio . Anyway that tap has sort of resolved the dissolving into a black screen as it happens less frequently since . I tapped below the bowed back area , above the power cord in spot . Thanks so much for your time . <p> When you have captions on your videos , can you please use white font with black outline ? You lose half of the text when there is a white object behind the white text if there is no outline . It makes the videos frustrating . <p> Lisa , First of all , what are you using the captions with , the TV or your SAT or cable box ? Whichever you are using , go into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What are you using with the captions ? Tell us and we can walk you through how to fix it . -RR <p> Juan , If after replacing the boards in your 60 ? LG TV and the problem is not resolved , you most likely have a screen issue . Check the screen for damage . Which boards did you replace ? Have you rechecked to make sure the ribbon cables are secure and not damaged ? -RR <p> Hisense 55 ? LCD LED TV . Suddenly the screen is covered in multi color vertical lines . Can not see any picture or the menu . It was not hit , we were just sitting watching it when this happened . No sound either . Any idea on h ow to fix this ? <p> Theresa , If this issue JUST HAPPENED while you were watching it , try unplugging it for 5 minutes and see if that resets it . Also try using a different input for the video as the media box you were using may be what is malfunctioning . How old is your HiSense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Hi thank you for replying . We tried unplugging it . We also tried disconnecting the cable box , trying a different outlet and letting it sit for a few hours . No matter what it still has the vertical lines on the screen even without the cable box hooked up . Its a year old and I can not find the receipt at this time . <p> Theresa , Then most likely the screen or a board is bad . Call the manufacturer and ask about warranty . Tell them the screen is NOT cracked but you believe a board inside the TV went bad and therefore should fall under the warranty . -RR <p> I have a Sony sxrd 60in projection TV . I have fixed the greenish yellow tint it had with a new sxrd color panel . It worked fine yesterday I turned it on today and the screen is black with green lines on the left side going vertical they have some blue in them to . Any ideas on what it is ? <p> Vince , Recheck the wiring and ribbon cables as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the color panel ? If you leave the projection TV on for a certain amount of time does it change anything ? -RR <p> First time ever posting a question on one of these days sites so I apologize in advance if I go about the wrong way . I have Vizio 55 ? RAZR led t.v. it has about a 6 inch grey vertical line going down the middle of the screen . It is kinda transparent where you can still see the picture through it . The line is visible regardless of what input I use and have reset the t.v. but nothing helps . If anyone has had this issue or can guide me down the right path , I would greatly appreciate it . <p> I have an LG 55LS5700 smart TV . I have been trying to connect my PC to the HDMI 4 ( PC ) input via HDMI-to-HDMI cable . The TV is detected by my PC but shows a screen full of vertical lines ( all different colours ) . I have tried plugging the cable into other HDMI inputs and switching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of vertical multi coloured lines . I am able to pull up the settings menu in front of the vertical lines and it appears clearly . I have checked the cable is fine by using it with my usual monitor . I have not yet tried opening the TVs back panel to check capacitors/ribbons etc . Is there anything that could specifically cause this issue with all HDMI inputs ? I have not had any other issues with the TV outside of this . I can watch TV , movies ( via USB hard drive ) , youtube etc all fine . <p> Matt , Update the video card on your PC . This is the only reason why you would be having this issue as this is common . Update the video card as we had the same exact issue as our video card was not updated for 4 years , we updated the video card with the newest update and it fixed it so we were able to see our PC on our HDTV . Another issue could be : You may have bent or damaged pins on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my video card ( HD7850 ) is already using the latest AMD Radeon Crimson version drivers Could there be any settings in the the Radeon Crimson control panel interface that could cause this ? I have ordered an HDMI-to-DVI plug adapter to try feeding the TV from the DVI port . I do n't  think it could be bent pins on the HDMI output though as I 've been using it to connect to my LCD screen for ages without any troubles .. <p> Matt , If you have the latest drivers for your AMD video card , then yes try using the HDMI to DVI and see if that works . There may be settings you can alter in the video card settings to tweak it so it works on the TV . If you are viewing 1080P or higher video definition , use a category 2 HDMI cable . <p> To connect the display using an HDMI connection ( and HDMI cable ) : Shut down the computer . Turn off the monitor or TV . Connect an HDMI cable to the computer and to the display . Turn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the input source to view . Turn on the computer . -RR <p> I have a Samsung LCD TV with vertical lines across the whole picture . This only occurs when connected to cable box , does n't  happen when connected to Apple TV , Xbox or blue ray player . Have had HDMI cable and cable box replaced twice by cable company . Last box worked for couple days . Cable company techs think TV but I do n't  understand why it only occurs with cable TV . <p> Yes I have tried directly to the hdmi inputs of the tv and different inputs on my denon AV receiver . I have had cable company representative check out there cables and have had them switch out cables 3 times as well as boxes three times . All to no avail . Could a bad tcon board cause this problem with only cable input and not other inputs ? <p> Rick , A bad t-con board COULD cause this but ( Horizontal lines on the screen are virtually NEVER caused by a bad T-con board . Horizontal lines indicate a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you tried to correct or find the issue ? -RR <p> Erick Varela , How wide are the horizontal lines and are they the result of the screen having a crack or the TV being hit by something ? When you say your Vizio TV is glitched , can you please explain in more detail as this may help us to understand what may need replaced . -RR <p> Thank for you response for my question . As for the TV being cracked , no it has not been hit nor is there a crack . I have used a flashlight and no crack . The lines are less a inch they flowing from 1 side to the other . As for the glitch that is when you are watching TV the show will stop and then continue but u miss part of the show . <p> Erick Varela , It sounds that you have a board issue . If the picture stops , and hesitates , then displays again , it is most likely not your screen . For us to look further into this ( as you may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to watch TV , a cable box , a SAT box , DVR ? Chromecast ? Roku ? -RR <p> Ola , Have you made sure the screen is not cracked or was hit in that particular area ? When you say the line appears BEHIND the menu pop up , does it only appear when viewing the menu or does the vertical line always appear even when watching TV ? -RR <p> Shivonne Sanchez , Is your TV LCD , LED , or plasma ? Since your TV was hit , is the screen cracked or just pushed in at a certain spot ? What model TV do you have ? Most TVs can be fixed using the correct replacement parts . A cracked or " dent " in the screen means you will have to replace the screen . -RR <p> I have a 50 ? Plasma Samsung flat screen . About a year and half ago , I had maybe two tiny ( one pixel size ) vertical lines show up on the right side of my screen . After a couple months , about two or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ length wise ) . Today I have about 7-8 one pixel size vertical lines on the right side and now about two vertical lines in the middle of my screen . The lines are coming from the TV itself . There are no HDMI cords connected to TV . The lines do not move around , but they do change colors depending on what is playing on the TV . Do you know what may be wrong ? <p> Katie , Can you activate the TV menu and see if the lines intersect ? If so does it look like the lines are on top of the menu , or the menu is on top of the lines ? If the lines are on top of the menu then the Plasma panel or the video buffers on the panel are faulty . Are the lines always lit ? Do they flicker ? Change colors ? disappear at times ? -RR <p> Oh my goodness , could someone please help ? My one year old toddler just used some sort of a plastic object and hit our 55 inch Samsung screen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vertically on the screen . The TV is still on and working . Is there anything I can do to reverse this ? <p> C. Walker , Can you check the screen closely and determine if it is cracked ? Vertical lines on a flat screen TV usually means a cracked screen . If the screen is cracked , the only fix is to replace the screen that is cracked . -RR <p> C. Walker , Yes then the screen will need to be replaced . You can try finding one for your TV on eBay or look on Craigslist to find a TV same as yours with a good screen but other parts are bad . If no luck , call a TV repair company near you to find out cost . May be cheaper to buy a new TV if you have it professionally repaired . -RR <p> Karuna , Is it possible the TV is fine but the cable or satellite channels that you are watching have an issue ? What are you using to watch TV ? Have you experienced this while watching Roku , Netflix @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watching TV ? If this happens while watching cable TV or SAT TV , does it happen ONLY happen on certain channels , meaning , you do n't  see the lines on certain channels ever ? May be a cable or SAT box issue . -RR <p> I have a 54.5 ' dick smith flat screen , the corner of the screen is cracked . If I turn on the screen there are vertically lines shows on the screen . Can you please let me know what should i do ? Hope to hear from you again . <p> Tepua , If the screen is cracked , that is what is most likely causing the vertical lines to appear . The complete screen will need to be replaced . Did something come in contact with the screen or did the crack appear on its own ? Heat related crack ? -RR <p> I have a Vizio LED TV 70 ? Model : M701d-A3 There is a single horizontal line across the screen that shows up in the lower aspect of the screen , extending more than 3/4 of the screen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can see it with all TV inputs and when you pull up the menu it appears over the Menu . How can I fix it ? <p> Giezy , Did you verify that the screen is not cracked ? Let us know if there is a crack causing the horizontal line or if it just appeared on the screen by itself . Use a flashlight and stand at an angle to see if there is a crack present . If not , is the screen slightly pushed in in that area ? -RR <p> I have a Toshiba 40L1353B LCD TV that is about a and half years old . It has all of a sudden had two consistent horizontal lines appear on the screen effectively dividing it in thirds . The bottom third box only has slight discoloring . Middle third and top third flash green/blue/reddish colors and other lines flash in these . It is still picking up pictures and sound . Any idea what this might be ? <p> Chris Watts , If the screen was not hit or damaged , not cracked , and the lines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ board issue . Most likely the t-con board is still good as Horizontal lines indicate a defective LCD panel ( screen ) . Check to see if the screen is cracked . If not , the screen is most likely defective and will need to be replaced . -RR <p> Just was wondering if you had any ideas for what 's wrong with my TV . Its an LG 55 inch LED 3DTV . I has sound but the picture is just black with dark grey vertical stripes all over . At first when it is powered on the lines are much brighter then most of them fade away but still no pic . I replaced the tcon board but did n't  change a thing . <p> I have a LG 60LN5600 . I got it less than 2 yrs ago . Unfortunately I did n't  get extended warranty . The TV screen has flashing white and black lines ( vertical and horizontal lines ) alternately but I can still see the pictures . After a few days , it just only gives me vertical black and white lines , no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( even volume button ) only make the screen blink and go back to the black and white lines ( 3/4 of the tv , only the 2 sides are black ) . Please let me know the problem , how to fix it and if it is worth to get it fix or should I start saving up for a new TV . <p> JC , If the LG TV screen is not cracked it may be a simple issue with the ribbon cables not being secure on one of the boards in the TV . Also a capacitor may have popped on a board . Many people have had the same issue as you and simply replaced a bad cap and the problem was fixed . If you take the TV apart to check internally , be sure to unplug it . Many times a bad cap on a board is found by doing an easy visual check . A cap is usually around a few bucks and can fix your TV if that is the problem . -RR <p> Patrick , A replacement screen may cost more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Here are different models of Samsung TV replacement parts . If you decide to part out your TV , you can do it on Craigslist , as many people are looking for remotes , stands , frames , and boards . -RR <p> I have a Samsung 46 ? LED TV. 2 very thin black lines have appeared at the top 3rd of the screen . These lines are visible equally on all inputs and is visible over the TVs menu . Any help is deeply appreciated as you can imagine , Samsung is no help . <p> Joshua Goodwin , Is the screen cracked ? If not the lines may be related to a heat issue inside the TV . A board may have overheated and somehow damaged the screen or possibly it is a board issue . Usually the lines appear from a bad t-con board . But not sure on your issue . You may want to take the TV apart and examine the boards to see if you can find any visible damage . -RR <p> I recently acquired a Panasonic LCD TC-L42D2 . It has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3 inches and a crack on the bottom left for about an inch . Previous owner told me that their kids dropped the TV not too long ago . Any suggestions on it is ? <p> Frances , If you look at the screen from an angle , does it look flat or pushed in at any point ? Obviously if the screen is cracked from being dropped , the screen should be replaced . However if the screen is pushed in , it could be making contact with an internal component therefore causing the lines on the left side of the screen . You will have to take a look at it in detail to find out . The crack may not be causing the lines . -RR <p> I 'm hoping you might be able to help me figure out what 's going on with my TV . I have a Sony Bravia KDL-46EX520 that is displaying flashing/flickering horizontal white and black lines along the top half of the screen ( bottom portion is perfectly clear ) . The lines are accompanied by ghosting images and will sometimes go away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and normal . All of these symptoms appear over the menu and show up on all inputs . Aside from the lines and ghosting/jittering images , the screen is not discolored at all . The problems showed up spontaneously one morning when first turning it on . The TV is wall mounted and is never touched , so it has n't  been moved around at all . Any idea what could be wrong ? Thanks in advance for any help you can give ! <p> Lokelani , Some Sony TVs need the firmware upgraded . If the problem you are describing happens only sometimes , try going into menu and updates . See if there is downloadable new firmware that you can install on the TV . If you can not , use a USB thumb drive and download the correct firmware for your SONY TV . Then put the USB drive into the TV to install the new firmware . Here is a page to download your Sony Bravia KDL-46EX520 TV firmware updates . -RR <p> Lokelani , Have you checked that the cables and or inputs may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different input with a NEW HDMI cable and just see what happens . If all inputs do the same thing then possibly the t-con board is bad . -RR <p> A friend gave me his 55 inch LG LCD Smart TV . There is a small pixelated horizontal red/purple/black line that only appears on a pure white background . It is n't there during any other colored background including light grey or even off-white . It is noticeable but only appears under the limited circumstance that the background is pure white . Any idea what the issue is ? <p> Rick , Sounds as if the screen was hit in that particular area . The screen is most likely hit and cracked in that area . Was the screen hit ? The screen will most likely need replaced . If it does turn out to be a board issue , horizontal lines on the TV screen are virtually NEVER caused by a bad T-con board . Horizontal lines indicate a defective LCD panel . -RR <p> Elias , Please tell us model number of your TV . Has something recently hit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you recently cleaned the screen with Windex cleaner or similar ? Please describe in detail . -RR <p> Also it 's an LG 55 if that helps at all . Well its weird because I 'm not sure what input it was but it must have been the HDMI of some kind and the verticals lines are like some are smaller than others . I have photos but I do n't  know if I can post them . But lines move across the screen and if its on the cable input its just white . <p> Shanna , Are you saying only the HDMI input is working properly and all others have the vertical lines ? Please explain in detail . But . Those types of vertical lines appear if the TV has been forcefully pushed on its screen or laid down on its back and had something heavy put on top for periods of time . Sometimes it can gradually go away , but if the TV screen was affected by the electronics being pushed behind it the damage may be permanent . You can try leaving the TV on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cause it to go away . How wide are the vertical lines ? Are they about 2 inches wide on your 55 ? TV screen or are they super thin vertical lines ? The more detail you can give us the more we can point you in the right direction to buy the right part to fix your TV yourself . -RR <p> Yep , I checked all inputs and tried swapping out with a new HDMI cable . The problem persists . And actually , it seems like the problem is getting worse since the other day ; the screen does n't  clear up for brief periods anymore , the flashing/jittering lines and ghosting stay on the screen all the time now . I 'll give the t-con board a shot though and see if that helps . Thanks so much for your help ! <p> Katie , Yes it does . It is usually not worth having a professional TV repair shop fix your broken or cracked TV . It will usually cost as much as a brand new TV when they include labor into the costs . Your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used parts to keep cost down . If you are unable to fix the TV yourself , usually the best solution is to put your old broken TV on a website such as Craigslist . There are people that also have broken TVs needing certain circuit boards , power supplies , etc , and will buy your old broken TV for the parts inside . When you sell your old broken TV , then you will have a little extra cash for new TV. -RR <p> The lines are vertical not horizontal . As stated in my earlier posts . Have tried new cables new boxes three times . Have tried going into other hdmi inputs on tv as well as other hdmi ports on denon receiver . Problem still persists .

At that time check the screen in all areas and the inside of the TV for any damage to circuit boards , etc -RR <p> Kevin , If you took the TV apart and found a burnt , corroded ( white ? ) , or a circuit board with popped caps , replace that board and possibly the ribbon cable .

Please leave your question below and we will be happy to assist . <p> LG does not care but I 'm going to convince Lowes that they should not be selling these washers . I 'm keeping a warranty on mine and calling Lowes every time it shows a UE so they can document what a sorry washing machine this is . Going to buy a Maytag and never buy another LG product as long as I live . <p> This was the solution to my UE error on my LG top load washer ( WT 5101HW ) : I had the same UE error come up on my 7-year-old LG topload washer two weeks ago . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mounting nut securing the rotor assembly underneath the washing machine was very loose . The rotor assembly that is held in place by that nut was about an inch lower than it is suppose to be . After this nut was tightened up with a ratchet , the UE error was gone and now the washer performs without any problems . Also , the main nut that secures the washer washplate in the tub was loose , and I tightened this up with a ratchet also ( If you remove the washplate , there will be a lot of slimy mildew looking material under it . I cleaned this off and now the chronic mildew smell in my washer is gone ) . Now the washer goes through the entire wash cycle normally . Hope this is helpful to someone out there ! <p> My model is WT5170HV Making it worse , the serviceman who took care of an issue early on wrote the wrong model number on my paperwork . Imagine how hard it was for me to get the right model number . I am SO SICK of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get up and down to the washer is a HUGE issue for me . So we are just ignored . There should be a way to update our firmware . If it were available I would use my own smart phone to fix it myself . I do n't  have many hundreds of dollars to fix this . It was supposed to super clean my clothing without wrecking it , and there should have been very few issues as it is all sensors and control board to manage it all , even load size etc . Less loads because mine is a huge drum size . I am begging someone at LG to address this . I had no idea , I thought it was my fault . I bought the super extended warranty but it expired in January . Had I known it was a common issue I would have called in repair well before the warranty was up ! I would have asked them to look at it before now . It wo n't run a load through AT ALL now . I cant even hire someone to help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because I am not an authorized dealer ? I live in Southern Ontario in Canada . LG please restore my faith in your brand . <p> I am so tired of almost every load displaying a UE . Error code even though floor and machine is balanced . This company should take care of this issue . The next machine I purchase will not be from this company of the issue does not get resolved . I should n't have to pay a repair man for issues that are common for this type washer . I paid enough for the set as it is <p> I get this error when running tub clean . I 'm not able to complete a tub clean . And there 's nothing in the tub except water ! I checked the center piece as suggested and it looks fine . Not sure what else there is to do . <p> I was shocked to find that the small bolt under the agitator was loose and this fixed my issue with the UE errors . It really was n't even super loose . I was ready to hall it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parking lot . <p> We have the same problem as thousands and thousands of other consumers have complained about . Our LG wt1101cw washer is on a flat concrete floor and perfectly leveled . It does n't  matter if we have a full load or nothing in the machine at all it keeps refilling and trying to balance a load that is centered perfectly or not even there . This happens every time and it takes two hours and constant resetting to get a load done . My question to LG is if we replace the out of balance / evaporation sensor is it going to finally wash our clothes without incident ? <p> My top loading LG washing machine every time I wash something I have to make sure it does n't  keep filling up with water from the UE code . I actually sit and watch every load when it gets ready to spin . I cant wait until the day when I can get another brand of machine . LG should replace every one of these machines . <p> Hello my lg washer continues to have UE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , towels , sheets , baby clothes or adult clothes it cycles 3 times and then sits until I find it , my water bill has significantly increased . I have leveled the washer I have made sure things are distributed , nothing seems to solve the problem . Very frustrating ! <p> I agree . It should never have been sold in stores . I think we all are going to lose the cost of the washers because they are all going to have to be replaced by another brand by each of us . LG does not want to take the responsibility of replacing these machines . <p> My LG top load washing machine almost always gets the UE error . Sometimes I remove and reload the wet heavy wash and it is fine but other times it takes several attempts . Most recently it took 4 hours to complete a load of 6 bath towels . We have made sure the tub and unit are level . Is there a recall ? Certain models need reprogramming ? Just curious before I call in a service call and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be fixable . <p> Our LG Washer and Dryer is between 3 and 4 years old . Since we have owned this washer it has constantly given us " UE " code errors . When you read the manual or their advertising it looks like just a simple issue that you have overloaded the machine . This is not true . This is a constant problem with our washer dealing with a small or large load . It just took me 3 hours to complete a normal wash before I could put clothes in dryer . I have also spent many hours on the internet looking for a solution . No real answers other than keep it on a low spin cycle . 90% of the reviews I see state that they have received little to no support from LG and that they are just trying to get a few more cycles out of it before they can move to another washer from another company . I am just saying this so other consumers looking at this product will be better informed .

Most commonly the toilet water fill valve ( aka toilet flush valve ) will need to be replaced . Sometimes removing and replacing the toilet flapper valve will also need to be completed if both parts are not working properly . The toilet fill valve replacement cost should be under $20 dollars including all the parts and supplies needed to do the job yourself . The 3 most common brands and repair part makers for toilets is Kohler , Toto , and American Standard . These 3 brands of toilets will accept most universal toilet repair parts so you will not have to buy the exact same brand name parts . Most home improvement stores such as the Home Depot will have just about every type of toilet repair parts and supplies that you will need to fix , repair , or replace the water fill valve yourself . To save you money , we recommend purchasing a Universal Toilet Water Fill Valve as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) water valves can be installed into 98% of all toilets . A universal water filling valve for your toilet will cost you about $15 dollars online or at your local hardware store . Here is a toilet repair video that can help you replace your water fill valve assembly . <p> What Does The Toilet Water Fill Valve Do ? The fill valve controls the amount of water that goes into the tank of your toilet . There are different types of fill valves in toilets as it will be a ball valve type or the newer universal type called a Fluidmaster . The older style ball valve is a plastic ball connected to a bendable metal rod that opens and closes the water fill valve . When the ball is moved up and down by the water level it opens a water valve that allows the tank to fill with water . The new kind of fill valve is usually called a Fluidmaster and it is a round plastic cylinder float that lowers and opens the water valve allowing water to come into the tank . Your water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shut off properly , will not refill your toilet with water , has become damaged , or is heavily corroded . <p> Before you go out and buy a new water fill valve assembly , try these steps first to make sure you really have to replace the valve . 1 : Water Supply ON ? Make sure the water coming from the wall into your toilet is turned ON ( fully open counterclockwise ) . This is the small silver water ON/OFF valve that is under your toilet . Make sure it has not been turned to the off position ( all the way clockwise and tight ) . 2 : Water Fill Valve Jammed ? It is possible for the water fill valve " float " to get stuck . There are many ways this can happen . Remove the toilet top lid and make sure there is nothing preventing the fill valve float from moving up or down freely . 3 : Water Fill Valve Adjusted Properly ? On SOME water fill valves there will be an area at the base of it to adjust the height @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is adjusted properly so the water is able to flow into the tank . 4 : Old Style Fill Valve " Ball " Float To Low ? On the old style ball float water valves , it can sometimes thread itself off or the corroded metal arm it threads into becomes bent . Make sure the ball float is adjusted properly by bending the metal arm to get the correct adjustment for the water level . <p> Universal Toilet Fill Valve Easy Replacement And Fits Most Toilets <p> Replacing Your Toilet Water Fill Valve:To remove a toilet water fill valve you must first turn off the water line to the toilet and then flush the toilet . Loosen the plastic nut on the bottom of the toilet tank . NOTE : Water will be in the tank so it is recommended to use something under the toilet to catch the dripping water . Inside the toilet water tank twist the plastic round piece counter clockwise ( near the bottom part of the valve ) and it should become loose . There is also a rubber washer under the valve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your bathroom floor , save this in case the new one is not the correct size . Once the old valve is removed , replace it with a new universal style fill valve . Adjust the height and put the new water fill valve into your toilet and secure it by tightening the plastic nut to hold it in place . The nut at the bottom of the toilet holds the valve in place and also the water line coming into your toilet . Tighten this nut and make sure the valve assembly is seated properly so it does not leak . Turn on the water to the toilet and make sure it fills properly and flushes properly . Adjust the water fill valve as necessary ( see instructions on the box ) . Check for water leaks behind the toilet and tighten any nuts or fittings as needed .

@@13196606 @1796606/ <h> Water Heater Making Noise ? Here Is What To Check Yourself ! <p> If your water heater is making noise lately , here are some things to check yourself . Your water heater can make different types of noises such as a popping , hammering , ticking , banging , hissing , and or sizzling sounds . There can be many different reasons as to why it is making such strange noises . Whether your water heater is gas or electric , we have some common reasons as to why the noise is occurring and how to stop it for good . <p> The 5 common reasons a water heater is making noise : <p> A ticking water heater usually means the heat trap ( which contains a small metal ball ) is being moved around from heat expansion . The heat expansion rattles the ball around and creates a strange ticking noise . This noise is common and does not pose a problem . ( A heat trap looks like this ) <p> A hammering sound means there was a sudden increase in the water pressure . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The noise coming from or around your water heater does not mean there is a problem and is quite normal . You may want to look into stopping the noise as it can be annoying if it happens on a regular basis . Stopping this particular noise is usually solved by installing brackets to hold the pipes extra tight . <p> A rumbling noise coming from the water heater usually means the aluminum anode rod in your water heater is corroding . The aluminum corrodes and then clogs the heater drain which results in a low rumbling noise . The way to fix this issue is to drain and completely flush out the water tank . It may be a good idea to use a lime removing solution to clean off any lime deposit build up that may be present . ( See the videos below for how to properly drain and flush your gas or electric water heater ) <p> A popping noise from inside the water heater means that cooler water is trapped under lime deposits and when heated it is quickly pulled out and creates a popping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flushing the water tank will take care of this problem . ( See the video below for how to properly drain and flush your gas or electric water heater ) <p> A sizzling sound from your water heater ( gas not electric ) means that as the hot air is vented , water vapor will condense on the upper exterior area and drip down onto the outside of the hot water heater . When a drop of water hits the hot exterior , it makes a sizzling noise/sound . You can purchase insulating tubes that wrap around the pipes or a complete water heater insulation blanket to stop this noise from happening . <p> I have a gas water heater making a loud pulsing humming noise , especially at night . The noise decreases when the water temperature is turned way down , so the water is only warm . Any idea what can cause this ? Its quite loud . <p> We have installed a new electric heater and there is a loud noise about from 10pm in the evening every now and then for quite a while and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same thing . Just wanting to know what could be the problem as there are no sediments cause its a brand new heater . Please advise .

@@13196613 @1796613/ <h> Do I Need To Use Plastic Wall Anchors For Wooden Wall Shelving ? <p> Question : I purchased IKEA shelves that weigh 4 lbs each . They are made of a wood like material . They came with 2 metal brackets that I attach to the wall and then mount the shelves to the bracket . Do I really need to put plastic anchors in the wall to hold them in place ? I have some drywall screws I think will work fine . The maximum load on the shelves is 25 lbs . I will be putting a maximum of 7 lbs on each IKEA shelf . Do you think I need the plastic wall anchors or can I use long drywall screws ? Please help . <p> How To Mount A Wall Shelf <p> Answer : If you are going to be attaching the shelves into drywall you need plastic anchors ( self drilling are best ) not just the wood screws . A drywall screw screwed into drywall will not hold the shelves for long . They will eventually fall out as the wood screw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wall anchors , you can get metal wall anchors that do not crack or split in half like the plastic anchors . <p> To mount shelving into drywall with plastic or metal anchors : Find exactly where you will be mounting the shelves . Use a level and mark with a pencil where the shelf will be attached horizontally . Find out where the brackets will need to be attached and measure accordingly . <p> They are usually 16 ? apart from one another but varies depending on when your house was built . <p> Once you locate and mark where the studs are , attach the shelf brackets with long drywall or wood screws . <p> If you cant get a stud finder then look for an electrical outlet on the same wall . <p> The outlet box is attached to the wood studs on one side ( either left or right obviously ) . <p> To find out which side the outlet box is attached to you can remove the cover to the outlet . <p> Look in with a flashlight to determine which side it is on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ located . <p> HINT : You can use a small 1 ? nail to hammer into the drywall to make sure you are hitting a stud before you drill . If did not find the wall stud , move the nail over an inch or 2 and try again . Eventually you will hit solid wood . Be sure to keep the nail holes in a horizontal line so the shelf will line up easier . ( The width of a common stud is 1 and 3/4 ? side to side ) <p> NOTE : Drywall is usually 1/2 ? thick . You will need screws that will go into the studs at least 1 inch plus the 1/2 inch thick drywall. 1 and 1/2 inch minimum screw length and the thickness of the bracket for the shelf .

@@13196615 @1796615/ <h> Dryer Not Heating ? Check Dryer Thermal Fuse On Back <p> If suddenly your clothes dryer has stopped drying your clothing , check the thermal fuse on back . Usually the dryer will STILL work in every aspect EXCEPT it will not dry . This means that it will still " tumble " and it will seem as if it is working properly . You will usually find this out after the dryer has " buzzed " to tell you it is done drying your clothes . You will open up the dryer door expecting dry clothes but they will be just tumbling in the dryer and not getting any heat to dry them . <p> What is a thermal fuse and what does it do ? A thermal fuse is a small electrical temperature sensitive switch that is made to interrupt electrical flow when heated to their specific rated trip temperature .

Carefully unplug the dryer from the wall , slide out the dryer , and remove the back panel ( on some dryer models the side panel or top panel will need to be removed : check your dryer owners manual ) . See the image above for what the thermal fuse will look like and location . Once you find the thermal fuse you will need to test it .

When you feel air blowing out it is not HOT air , correct ? Everything is working , tumbling , lights up , but NO HEAT ? Have you made sure that the power getting to the dryer is the correct voltage ? Usually 240V 220V depending on where you live . Is it possible you have the dryer outlet set on a 2 breaker system and possibly one of the breakers is off and one is on ? Have you checked the thermal fuse ?

If the food and liquids in the fridge are freezing , what would make my refrigerator all of a sudden start to freeze all the items in it ? Is my refrigerator broken ? Please Help ! <p> Refrigerator Freezing Food <p> Quick Answer : If your refrigerator is " all of a sudden " freezing your food and drinks , the temperature setting for the fridge has been inadvertently set TOO LOW or TOO COLD . Try setting the refrigerator section temp to medium or the number 5 . If your refrigerator let 's you set the exact temperature , set it to 40 -F or a little below .

@@13196619 @1796619/ <p> Question : Our older refrigerator seems to be much colder than normal . The dial on the refrigerator setting dial has the numbers 0-9 . The problem is that there is no indication of which number ( higher or lower ) to set the dial to make the refrigerator colder or warmer . Generally , what number is coldest on a refrigerator ? The highest number or the lowest number ? Quick Answer : The higher number is the coldest setting . <p> Most refrigerator temperature settings are controlled with a dial or slider . They are sometimes labeled 1 through 5 or 1 through 9 . If you are not sure what to set it to , then set it somewhere in the middle . If the dial is numbered 1 to 5 set it on 3 , if the dial is numbered 1 to 9 , then set at 4 . USUALLY the higher the number on the temp control dial , the colder the temperature your refrigerator will get .

Allow 12 to 24 hours between each adjustment . Low ( colder ) temperatures are key to prevent bacteria growth and to keep your food fresher longer . Here is information on storing food at safe temperatures . <p> If you turn the dial to number 0 , that effectively turns the fridge off . Setting the dial to 9 , the refrigerator will be working at its max capability . Your personal temperature setting will depend on how much food is kept in the refrigerator . If your fridge is packed with food , it needs to be on a higher number setting to maintain a low ( colder ) temperature . <p> The temperature controller dial or slider on your refrigerator is a thermostat .

Use cloth on the clamps so it does not damage your door frame further . Give it a few hours or so for the glue to dry . Once the glue is dry you can remove the wood clamps . At this point you may need to sand down any bumpy areas ( dry glue ) on the door as you will most likely be touching it up with some paint once you have fixed the door . <p> Once the crack is fixed from using the wood glue and clamps , reinstall the door . It may be best to use longer wood screws then you had previously . A 2 ? or 2.5 ? wood screw is usually the standard for door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ properly and there is no sagging . If there is still sagging see the next method below for fixing your door . <p> Add a few cardboard shims under the door hinge to stop sagging <p> If your door has no cracks on the frame and the hinges are in good shape and the screws are tight and the correct length , try the next method . This is super easy and will fix your door from sagging and hitting the frame . This is called the FIX YOUR SAGGING DOOR WITH CARDBOARD SHIMS METHOD . <p> First , get a cardboard box or any cardboard you have around the house . Use a box cutter ( on a hard surface ) and cut a few pieces of the cardboard to the shape of the door hinge . Make them around a 1/4 ? smaller than the actual door hinge so no cardboard protrudes from behind the hinge . OK , now you need to make the holes in the cardboard that match the holes on your door hinges . Make one template and then if needed use that to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shim to fix your sagging door <p> Next , you need to figure out which hinge needs the shim . You can simply take the screws out of one hinge without removing the complete door . Just remove the screws , pull the door out VERY CAREFULLY just enough to slide your cardboard shim underneath it . Once the cardboard is in place , screw the hinge back on with the shim underneath . It helps to have someone assisting you at this point to hold the door steady . <p> Lifting a Sagging Door : Door Installation &amp; MaintenanceLifting a sagging door is something you can do easy by replacing the screws with longer ones <p> If the top of the door ( above where the lock and door handle are located ) is hitting or rubbing the top edge of the door frame , then you need to add a cardboard shim to the very bottom hinge . This will make the door push slightly outward from the bottom meaning the top will be pushed slightly inward . If you have the perfect shim or shims thickness , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of your door ( below where the lock and door handle are located ) is hitting or rubbing the bottom of the door frame , then you need to add a cardboard shim to the very bottom and possibly the middle hinge also . The solution to this is to push the door outward from the lower hinge therefore squaring it up and stopping the sagging . <p> Once you have the cardboard shims in place , make sure the door has stopped sagging . If not , you may need to add more cardboard behind the door hinge to push it outward even further . <p> NOTE : Usually your door will be out of alignment or sagging by just a few fractions of an inch . So you may NOT need thick cardboard . You can use a piece of thin cardboard from anything in your house including a cereal or instant rice box or similar . <p> Using a cardboard shim would be incredibly simple . I will have to try this technique on my dads door at his house . It hangs down low on one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think I have a box in my storeroom I could use for the job . <p> I thought that repairing a sagging door would be kind of tough , so its good to know that its actually easier than I thought . Making a cardboard shim to prevent my door from sagging seems really easy . The bottom of my door hits the bottom of the door frame , so now I know that I 'll need to install a shim not just to the bottom of the door , but also to the middle hinge . Ill be sure to try that to see if it will push my door outward enough to stop it from sagging . <p> Even after replacing the hinges ( which made an obvious improvement on the door sagging ) we still had problems with the lock aligning properly . I 'm starting to wonder if it is possible that the very door frame has changed shape , but it became clear that fixing the sagging wasnt going to be enough . Were probably going to need to replace the whole frame and install a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some basic door repair ! Ive been struggling with a sagging bathroom door lately , and this seems like it might help . It would be great if I could fix it this weekend ! Unfortunately , my front door is also having issues .

I pulled the drain pump and assembly group out and all hoses . 1st time around I had a clogged hose coming from upper part of washing cylinder ( not large bottom hose ) . I ran it under water and it literally filled my sink with cardboard looking soap scum chunks . I assumed that was the culprit and assembled it back together . That worked for about 3 weeks . The ND code came back so I then bought a new drain pump . Well , while installing new drain pump I had noticed that the large gray gasket leading into washer has a drain itself . That was clogged with a large piece of plastic and surrounded by hair . Washer works like new now . Conclusion : ND definitely means pump is out or you literally have a clogged hose ( check them ALL ) or drain port . <p> I have a Samsung front loading washer VRT . It will not drain , therefore it wont spin . If I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I cant manually drain this thing every time I do a wash .

Put it back together and attempted to run a " normal " cycle . The machine ran for about half of the cycle , but then came back with the same error . I noticed that I could get it to partially drain a few times if I unplugged it for a while and started again . Next , I replaced the pump moron ( the black side of the pump assembly ) , hoping that would solve the problem . When it was back together , it started a wash and did the initial drain , but then the error came back .

Take the washer apart and check to be sure all drain lines , hoses , drain pump , wall drain , are clear and free of debris . -RR <p> Matt , The Samsung ND error code means NO DRAIN . When this error code displays the washer will not spin either . This either means the drain pump is bad , not getting power , or clogged , the drain hoses are blocked or clogged , or a faulty communication or wire harness issue . Have you checked all drain hoses and made sure the wiring connections are secure and the drain pump gets power ? Also , you may have a clogged wall or floor drain that is preventing the washer from draining . -RR <p> I have a 2010 Samsung wf210anw/xaa and have tried all of the options above with no luck . I also called customer service who wants to schedule a service visit but Samsung actually does n't  have a serviceman that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what part is most likely broken and needs replaced . I 'm assuming its the drain pump but the signs sometimes conflict and it may be spin speed only causing it . I generally can run the machine on normal and it will go through the wash cycle fine , from 58 minutes to 33 remaining on the display . I then have to vacuum the machine out from the drain hose with a wet vac which will get it continuing through to start its rinse cycle . A few minutes later on a fast spin it will generally need to be vacuumed again so I wonder if it could be a balancer or something related to the spinning because of the force of the tub . Then I vacuum again when it gets to 11 minutes and the spin cycle which is a nightmare and the tub refills around 8 minutes and I have to vacuum it out . Its not 3 vacuums and done , sometimes the tub refills and the machine still is n't happy and it will hang on 27 minutes and several vacuums of refill and empty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm not sure if the drain pump is the culprit or something else . <p> Marbeth , Most likely something is jammed or clogging the pump , possibly the drain hose also . Open the machine up and check the pump , pump hoses , drain hose , etc You will most likely find something stuck in there which is giving you the ND = NO DRAIN error . -RR

@@13196635 @1796635/ <h> Things To Turn Off When Leaving Your Home For Extended Periods <p> Question : I am going on vacation for 2 months and I am wondering what to turn off and what to leave on in my home ? I do not want to come home to a flood or melted food in my refrigerator . Can you tell me everything I can do to make my home safe and disaster proof when I am away ? Answer : If you are going to be away from your home for long periods of time , here is what to turn off . Whether you are going on a long vacation ( holiday ) , a business trip , or leaving your home empty for whatever reason , here are some important tips to keep your home safe . <p> Should I turn the water off ? The MOST important is WATER ! . If any pipe or water line bursts , your house will flood . To avoid this , you need to turn off the water supply to your home . Turning off the water to your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caused by a broken pipe . A water flood will destroy your carpets , flooring , drywall , appliances and more . Your homes main water supply shut-off valve should be located in your garage , in the yard , or out near the street under a panel that has the label " water " on the top . If you are leaving for more than a few days , it is best to turn off the water to avoid a flooding problem . NOTE : Remember to turn off your automatic ice maker in your freezer so it does not constantly attempt to pull in water . If you have a watering system in your yard , if you turn the water off to your home , your grass , garden , or flowers will not get water . <p> Should I leave my A/C or Heat on ? Another question people need to know is concerning the central air . If you are leaving for extended periods , leaving the central air on or off will depend on the weather outside . If is is extremely hot outside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a setting that will keep the home slightly cool . If it is extremely cold outside , it is best to leave the heat on so items in your home do not freeze . Keeping the heater temperature on will help keep the water pipes in the wall from freezing . Even if your water main is turned off , some water may still be trapped in the pipes . If you allow the home to freeze , these pipes may burst and cause damage to your home . To be safe , leave the central AC or heat on . <p> Should I unplug my refrigerator ? Unplugging your refrigerator is recommended in case of power outage . If there is a power outage , your food will warm up or defrost and then refreeze when the power comes back on . This is not a good thing to happen . You may not know the food in the freezer was thawed and then refrozen . This food could make you sick depending on how long the power outage had lasted . To avoid all of this , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then unplug the refrigerator/freezer and you wont have anything to worry about . <p> Should I turn the water heater off ? Most people do not turn off the water heater when they leave . However it is a good idea to avoid problems . You can turn off power to the water heater by switching off the breaker . When you have the power off you can drain it using a hose . Draining it will prevent a problem if a leak did occur . NOTE : If you are leaving for a few months and do not have anyone checking up on your home while you are away , then tuning off and draining your water heater is recommended . <p> Should I unplug electronics ? Yes . Unplugging electronics will avoid problems if there is a power spike or lightning strike . Removing power from your electronics will also help save a small amount of electricity . If your electronics are plugged into a power strip , then you can simply just unplug the power strip . Unplugging computers , routers , and modems is 100% @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good idea to unplug just about anything that uses electricity . Unplug everything you can including your dishwasher , washer , dryer , coffee maker , toaster , garbage disposal , blender , and so on . <p> Should I unplug my garage door opener ? YES ! Thieves have found out how to open a garage door by using hacked remotes and universal remotes . Leave your automatic garage door opener unplugged to avoid being robbed . <p> Empty Home Suggestions : To make it look like someone is living in your home while you are away , install timers on the lamps and lights inside your home .

Have the rows of organic honey jars at the farmers market got you thinking about starting your own backyard beehive ? If you live in a suburban area , you may think that starting a beehive can not be done . However a common suburban backyard can be a perfect place for beehives if done correctly and you do a bit of research and planning before ordering your bees and supplies . It is actually a very simple and easy process with the right tools . Everything you need is below including a supplies list and pictures of our DIY beehive . <p> Materials Needed TO Make Your Own Backyard Beehive In A Jar:1 Piece of 2 ? x 12 ? x 6 ' wood ( cut 2 pieces for the sides to 22 ? ) 1 Piece of 2 ? x 12 ? x 6 ' wood ( cut 2 pieces for the front and back to 18 ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 6 ' wood ( cut 2 pieces for the top frame left and right sides to 22 ? ) 1 Piece of 1 ? x 1 ? x 6 ' wood ( cut 2 pieces for the top frame front and back to 18 ? ) 1 Piece of thick plywood ( cut to 16 ? X 20 ? ) 1 Bottom beehive kit ( for the bees to enter and exit ) 12 Big mouth quart sized jars ( for honeycomb ) 1 Box of wood screws ( size 1 ? screws ) 1 Can of wood stain ( use a dark wood stain of your choice ) And of course , you need bees , most bees are available only in March and April but you can try these links to order your honey bees online 3lbs of honey bees Queen Bees For Sale Queen &amp; Package Bees <p> First get a piece of thick plywood and cut to 16 ? x 20 ? . Then measure and center for 12 holes and drill the pilot holes . Next , drill 12 3 1/2 ? holes with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Here is the 12 beehive jars arranged and installed in our backyard beehive . The jars sit with the screw lid on for less than 1/16 ? gap between the jar and the beehive hole . You may need to add some shims to support the weight so it wont sag with the weight of the honey . <p> Another view of our DIY backyard beehives in a jar project . You can vent and screen this chamber if there is excess heat or put the beehive where it gets late day shade . The bottom wooden piece we purchased as a kit and this is where the bees enter and exit the beehive . <p> The bees are seen here after we added them to the jars , they are now ready to make organic honey . <p> After much time , here is what the honeycomb jars look like filled with honey . <p> I 'm confused on dimensions . The sides are 18 ? and 22 ? . Because the box joints overlap by 1 ? on each end ( not by 3/4 ? as for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is 16 ? x 20 ? , the same size as the plywood top with the 3-1/2 ? holes . Therefore , the top fits into the opening but has no way to be attached to the sides . Obviously that 's not the case . How is the plywood attached to the sides ? My best guess is that the top is actually 18 ? x 22 ? , but after the 1 ? x 1 ? frame pieces are installed , the usable space is 16 ? x 20 ? . Is the top sandwiched between the frame and the sides ? Unfortunately the pictures are not large enough to see if that 's the way they 're assembled . Thanks for the fun idea . <p> First , this is NOT a project for a beginning beekeeper . The jars only have the screw ring but NOT the lid on them , so the jar is still open . The bees will build comb in the jars and fill and cap the comb with honey . When you remove the jars , you allow the bees to exit the jar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rest of the space in the jar and then put the lid with seal on it . <p> It always amazes me how people have questions but do n't  take the time to read the information in front of them . Simply amazing . Thank you for this awesome tip about bees and honey and hives . Read , people , read ! <p> Lots of misinformation in the comments section , along with somegood questions . The jars have the screw lid on , but NOT the metal cap . In other words the jar mouth is completely open . The board with the holes that the jars fit in to sit on top of the bees brood chamber . The brood chamber is where the main bee hive is where the bees raise their young and live . Bees store their honey directly above their brood chamber ( and some IN the brood chamber ) . Normaly beekeepers put boxes called " supers " above the brood chamber for the bees to use to draw the honey comb and store the honey . In thise scenario , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on top . The jars fill the holes of the board , and the board covers the hive so that rain and sun do n't  get in . In hot areas it needs to be in the shade or the jars cook and tansfer heat into the hive . No wax foundation is put into the jars . Bees have been building honey comb for millions of years without human wax foundation . The jar is simply an empty cavity ( like a tree cavity ) where they can build comb to store honey . The bees build the comb , fill the comb with honey , and then cap the comb with wax so the honey does n't  drain out . The bee keeper then removes the jars once its capped , and fills it up the rest of the way with honey that 's been extracted from normal hives . You then dip the honey out with a spoon . As you get down into the comb , you use a spoon to dig out chunks of comb filled with honey . When you do it this way , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) and spread it on toast , or put it in tea , or eat it straight ( or however else you eat honey ) . The wax is a bit chewy , but perfectly safe to eat , and rather tasteless . Its the honey that tastes amazing ! Hope this helps <p> My Dad used to always get honey with the comb in it because he knew it was pure and unprocessed . someone asked " what do you do with the comb " You chew it ! lol , its wax with honey instead , its great , or was when I was a kid ! My only question is , how do you start it , where do you get the first queen and workers , , , buy them.because I have no idea where you would get wild bees . <p> The bees make the comb in the jars and will fill the comb with honey . Lids stay off while jars are on hive . Cover the jars with deep super and lid . The jars get filled with honey by you after the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not a bee person but I do eat honey . My question is why would somebody want the honeycomb ? For example if I bought this jar of honey what would I do with the honeycomb ? It seems it would be in the way . <p> This was actually a fairly common practice in the late 1800s , and beekeepers competed ( at county fairs , etc. ) to have the loveliest comb drawn out in glass globes that had been attached to the rest of the hive . I do believe the bees fill most if not all the comb with their own comb , then the beespace between the honey combs is filled with extra honey . <p> I tried this about 2 weeks ago in lieu of a regular honey super ( above 2 deeps ) covered with a medium super and telescoping outer cover after about 10 days with no real activity in any of the pint jars I replaced with a conventional honey super once that is 85 90% full I will retry to see if the bees will take to it . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inverting for the honey super to give them a base to start from this time . One concern is ventilation as this closes off the normal inner cover venting i may add some screened vent holes to between jars or possibly replace the center jar ( or jars ) to ensure the bees do n't  get too hot <p> @Karen ( and others that made similar comments ) : The bees build out the comb in the jars . You would remove the jars when they are all drawn out . Turn the jars right side up . Add your own honey from a prior extraction . Its a novelty idea to either increase the wow factor ( so you can charge a higher price ) , or to give away as a gift that is unusual and unique . Note ; you can not remove the comb without destroying it . You add your own honeythe bees do n't  do it . This is not in lieu of a normal beehive system . You will still need at least two brood chambers below this setup . The bees will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bees create wax from 8 wax-producing glands on their sides , which is what they do naturally in the wild . The goal here is to provide a novelty item , and not a jar that you would want to extract the comb or honey from . That defeats the purpose of this project . Finally , I recommend that an empty super be placed over the jars to block the heat and sun . <p> I was told by a beekeeper that the bees only make the comb and the honey is just poured in over the honeycomb . She said that the bees cap the honey in each cell and if you look at the picture , none of the cells have been capped . <p> Do you put the beeswax sheets inside the jars before adding to the hive to help them build their comb ? It looks that way in the pictures but you do n't  mention it in the instructions . Ideally bees need wax frames to build their cells in , and you can buy the wax sheets either on or off the metal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wax was warm ( not hot ) they would bend into circles to fit the jars and make the job of the bees a lot lot easier . If you left them on the metal wires you should also be able to pull them out of the jars more easily which would help alot when it comes to putting them in the centrafuge for removing all the liquid honey . Then they can easily be reused . <p> Heather The same reason honey does n't  drip out the bottom of a conventional bee box . <p> Everyone else That first video explains everything . The jars are mounted atop traditional bee boxes , the frames underneath . You are n't  regulating the bees to ONLY the jars ; you are letting them extend their combs into the jars so you can have an interesting effect . The man says straight " Its a novelty item . " <p> Is the that foundation in the jars or have the bees built the comb ? You mention the lids being put on or do the jars just fit over the queen excluder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the brood box and build thier comb etc , do you put foundation the jars to start them off ? <p> Ive read this before and this is a great idea and IF i have a good honeyflow here and IF i have enough time to work up the woodwork i would love to try it on one of my hives . You do n't  extract it you just top it off with extracted honey . There is such a thing as combed honey or chunk honey that you could sell it as . The only gotcha i see is since the bees are building the comb from top to bottom of the jar and there is a 6 degree angle poiinting to the bottom of the jar if fthe honey is n't capped it will empty out of the comb unless you immediately fill the jar with honey once its harvested . i assume you would need a bee one-way entrance underneath the jar board when its time to get rid of the bees , correct ? <p> As to keeping the weather out , the hive remaining cool , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ realize that the frame less honey super box was removed for photo purposes . That keeps the chamber dark , cool , and allows for your telescoping cover to rest on the super and the bees remain happy . This works best for ferral swam hive captures . They are better at making comb and in a frame less comb . <p> I have a question about this project . Will the bees live through the winter in this type of beehive ? I am just starting looking for the " right type " of beehive for myself . The winters are cold in Tennessee . I really think this looks incredibly interesting . <p> If you watch the video , he says he pours honey into the jar after the bees have built the comb up . So I am guessing this method does not create the honey for a backyard bee keeper , it just makes the novelty of the comb in the jar . <p> I 've had bees previously and thoroughly enjoy them , but they are work . I think this project would be much the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard work too ! My only question though , is how to extract the honey from the jars at the end of the season . The rest I can figure out . I do n't  foresee a problem with getting the bees into the hive or getting them to start building honeycomb , but its the extraction that worries me that and what to do when another super needs to be added ? I guess when one jar is full of honey/honeycomb , it could be removed and replaced with another jar . Each jar could have the lid put on it once it has been removed and until such time as a removal process is determined . I might have to try something like this next summer . I think the kids would thoroughly enjoy watching the whole process ! ! <p> Most bee keepers would tell you that this is a bad way to go . I would have to say it is Great . If you have a fully built up hive and the nectar is flowing they will fill a small jar in just a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or less , shallow jars work the best . You can sell them as a novelty item . A jar of honey that would sell for just 3 or 4 dollars can be sold for a lot more , say 8 or 10 dollars a jar because people have never seen this method . It also helps you if you are short on money and cant afford supers , frames , boxes , foundation , ect . I would not recommend this method with large jars if you are a new beekeeper . Giving them say about 4 big jars could be a little overwhelming to the bees . = <p> Interesting idea on an observation hive . The bees enter the jars by going through the queen excluder , which is placed on top of the brood supers . The standard langstroth style supers have ten frames , each frame has a sheet of foundation ( thin bees wax , or other material with the shape of a worker sized cell embedded into it on which the bees build their original brood comb ) the bees build comb naturally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ run out do to the orientation of the cells and viscosity of the honey , once cured . <p> I 'd recommend taking a few basic beekeeping lessons before attempting this project . I only keep a few hundred colonies , and have for over 30 years , and am a sixth generation beekeeper . But yes this looks like a fun , but low level productive , and all you get is a bunch of crossed up comb you have to eat with a spoon . <p> This is a cool DIY project . I 'm wondering how you can call it ORGANIC , though . Unless you were at least 6 miles out from surrounding neighbors , how would you protect the bees and the honey from the use of pesticides ? <p> I 'm really interested in doing this bee/honey project , but I have three questions before I start it : 1 How do you get the bees into the jars to make the honey and out of the jars to use the honey . 2 The article says : The jars sit with the screw lid on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beehive hole . My question : With the lids on the jars , how do the bees get in and out of the jars to gather pollen ? If the lid and screw top is on the jar , even if the lid is not on tight the inner ring would fall down onto the jar ring , leaving no gap for the bees to get in or out of . 3 The article says : The bees are seen here after we added them to the honeycomb . It sounds like the honeycomb was added first , then you added the bees . It also sounds like the bees did not make the honeycomb . My question : If the bees did not make the honeycomb ? Where did the honeycomb come from ? Thanks for the article , and answering the questions .

The dishwasher is running normal but when it completes the wash cycle , my dishes are not clean and the detergent tablet is still there . The dishwasher is not dissolving the tablet . Maybe a little bit but about 80% of it is still there . I believe it gets hot water and runs normally . The apartment management said to use dishwasher cleaning tablets and not the powder soap . What can I do to try and get the tablet to dissolve ? Any help you can provide would be great ! <p> ANSWER : If your dishwasher hot water temperature is below 110F/115F , then it may not be hot enough to dissolve certain brands of detergent tablets . Be sure the water is HOT before you run the dishwasher . Run the hot water in the sink until it is very hot , then immediately run the dishwasher . Run the dishwasher on the longest , hottest cycle it has . <p> Also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door is working properly . If the detergent dispenser is too small a big detergent tablet may not be letting it open correctly . It may be jamming up the door . Try using a liquid or gel dish washing detergent if this is the case . There are many high quality liquid and gel dishwasher detergents on the market today . Liquid Cascade seems to be the best so give that a try . A powdered detergent will work too . Use a rinsing aid also as this will help remove spots even when the tablet may not be dissolving properly . <p> KEEP THE DISHWASHER DETERGENT DISPENSER CLEAN <p> If you are in an apartment , then most likely you do not have a high quality dishwasher . Knowing this , the dishwasher needs all the assistance it can get with the hottest water possible . You also need to be sure your dishwasher is clean at the bottom ( removable strainer filter ) where the pump and bottom washer arm is located . Be sure that it is clean and has hot water and this will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use tablets , you can break them in half in the sink first . Place them in the dispenser and the hot water should make it easier to dissolve since the tablet is not as large . <p> You also need to be sure there is enough water for the pump to actually pump the water . To check this , start the dishwasher . Once you hear it running , open the dishwasher and be sure there is hot water and enough of it . If there is not much water in the dishwasher it may not be getting much water to the pump . When you open the door while it is running , check the water level at the bottom of the washer . If there is not much water at the bottom , then it may not be getting enough water to clean dishes and dissolve the tablet . Clean the filter at the bottom of the dishwasher to help the pump get the water more efficiently . <p> DISHWASHER PARTS IDENTIFICATION <p> If all else fails , you may have an old worn out dishwasher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heater is set to low . Your water heater should be set right around 120F . This will ensure that your dishwasher is getting the correct water temperature to effectively clean dishes and dissolve the tablet . If in an apartment , let the management know you are having this issue and they SHOULD resolve it . <p> Do you know of another way to assist a dishwasher to dissolve a detergent tablet ? Please leave a comment below . <p> We own a kitchenaid dishwasher kdfe104dbl . Was not dissolving soap . Tried everything suggested . Then called repairman . He said it was the control board , which he said was damaged because the garbage disposal was on the same circuit . $350 repair . Still did not dissolve detergent . After much Googling discovered the switch for the detergent dispenser was faulty . It was dropping the tablet at the end of the cycle , or dribbling the liquid out at the end of the cycle . I put the tablet directly at the bottom center of the dishwasher and it dissolved and cleaned the load . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will replace the dispenser , OEM Whirlpool Dispenser W10409521 , although there is a newer part number we could have purchased hoping this older part number was not replaced because it fails regularly . <p> I found that the tablet was not falling when the flap opened . This is because the compartment was wet when I put the tablet in , it then dries as the machine warms up and the tablet sticks . The answer is first make sure the compartment is dry then give it a quick squirt of WD40 and the tablet will slip out as soon as the flap opens . <p> I always used Cascade gel and I still got gunked up filters . Had to call repair man and he said he sees this with cascade gel and mainly when people use too much detergent . So try gel , but just try filling dispenser half way . <p> Something I learned recently , the little chamber where the detergent packet goes has to be completely DRY before placing the tablet/pod in there . I 've never had problems with finding leftover detergent in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go into here . ) <p> But it makes sense that if there 's even a small bit of water in contact with the pod , it might actually get stuck . Sometimes after loading my dishwasher that detergent chamber is full of water . If full , I usually just close the door for a sec and it drains out , then I wipe out any remaining dampness with a paper towel , put the pod in , close the door and start the machine . My KitchenAid has a Sani-Cycle that heats the water in the machine , but I think it also heats a regular load to 120- if it detects a lower water temp , like if we 've used a bunch of hot water with laundry , showers , and the hot water heater ca n't keep up . <p> When In Doubt , Read The Instructions . It does seem funny that there would even BE instructions on Dishwasher detergent , but apparently its important to keep these things dry while they 're waiting to pop out into the load . There is a pre-rinse ( maybe two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thru the cycle , so it would have time for problems to start if gotten wet too soon . <p> We have a brand new GE Dishwasher and from the beginning , the soap dispenser either does n't  open , or at the end of the cycle , there is still soap in it from the pods not dissolving all the way . I made sure the water heater was set at 120F and I always turn on the hot water in the sink right before I start it . I use the pods usually and the plastic from them is sometimes still in the dispenser after a cycle , and I have been trying out the Finish tablets , and they are n't  dissolving all the way either . Im having to run an extra cycle everyday just to rinse out the dishwasher , and there 's always soap still on my dishes . Do you have any suggestions ? <p> Sarah Smithson , You may need to raise the temp on your dishwasher by means of the water heater in your home . Here is an article about Recommended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Cascade gel detergent as this has no plastic around it and may dissolve much better . You may also have a blockage in the detergent assembly . If there is restricted water flow , it will not dissolve the tablet or detergent properly . Let us know what you find . -RR <p> We have a new Bosch dishwasher with the top third tray . Not always , but frequently after the dishwasher is done , the tablet is in the front of the fist shelf undissolved . We use Finish with powerball which was recommended by salesclerk . I am getting tired of running 2 cycles for each load ! Suggestions ? <p> Nancy Ogrinc , Test to see if the water is hot enough . Bump up the water heater if needed . Make sure the water entering the Bosch dishwasher is from 120F to 140F . If it is and the Finish Powerball Detergent does not dissolve Use a liquid Cascade as it is already a gel liquid and works better when having dishwasher detergent " dissolve " issues . -RR <p> I bought the Wal-Mart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in our house is relatively new . It only dissolved when on the hottest cycle . Frustrating . My mother suggested piercing the packs with a knife a few times before putting it in the dispenser . Works like a charm ! <p> The dishwasher certainly heats up the water but its from a cold water supply . So I 'm thinking that the water is n't hot enough to dissolve the tablet ? However this does n't  happen all the time so ca n't get a fix on the actual circumstances when the problem occurs . <p> John Evans , Why not stop using hard tablets and use a GEL like Cascade Gel and then you will not need super hot water to dissolve the tablet . In the meantime , the heater/elements in your dishwasher may be bad or on the fritz . You can test it with a meter if needed . -RR

When purchased brand new from the manufacturer it only gets shipped to you with the USB cable to charge it by connecting it to a USB port on your PC . <p> REMEMBER You cannot- efficiently use your Kindle Tablet while charging via USB because its using more power than you are supplying to it . If charging your Kindle by USB is not charging fast enough , then you will have to purchase a separate power adapter . You may try using your Smartphone charger and see if that works . There is no risk of overcharging it as an iPhones charger wattage or amp rating is always lower than tablets .

This would be known as an " Accelerated Boost Charger " . So make sure the charger is 1.8 amps or higher . <p> Another suggestion would be to buy a " USB Power Outlet " at Home Depot or Lowes and use that with your supplied USB cable . <p> Remember if your Kindle is older and you use it all the time , then that could indicate a faulty battery that needs to be replaced . <p> Beonssa , If the USB plug going to your Kindle is only charging if you hold it a certain way , either the USB cord is damaged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or may have something stuck in it .

In some cases when using a Tablet computer running Googles Android OS , certain apps can take up the majority of the CPU resources and slow your Kindle down . You can identify which apps are causing this and using too much memory by going into the Task Manager . You can also use an app like " Task Killer " , and Force Stop an app that is taking up too much of your system resources . If the app continues to not work properly , you should uninstall it .

Remember to always remove or disconnect power before troubleshooting electrical issues . <p> Question : The power outlets along one wall are no longer getting power to them . The outlets that stopped working are located in our kitchen . This problem is only happening on one wall not the complete room . The dining room and kitchen are side by side and separated by a wall with the outlets that are not working . The outlets on the dining room side wall are still working . So our issue is just one wall of outlets in our kitchen where we plug in all of our appliances is not working . We checked the breaker box in the garage and no circuit breakers have been tripped . There is no GFI reset button on the outlets to press . What can I do to troubleshoot and fix this ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unplug everything that is plugged into all the outlets that do not have power . Then reset the designated ( and hopefully labeled ) kitchen breaker in the breaker box by turning it off and then on again . Sometimes a breaker will look like it is not tripped but in reality it is . By turning it off and then back on , you are making sure that the breaker is on and supplying power to that region of your house . Check to see if you have power on that wall and if so then it was just a tripped breaker . If this did not solve your issue , see below for what to do next . <p> If the breaker is on and the outlets are still not getting power on that wall , be sure that even if one of them is a GFI that you press the reset button . If there is no GFI reset button , then your issue may be that one outlet is damaged or has a loose wire . This could be causing the other outlets to also have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are not working may be daisy chained . Think of it like the old Christmas lights . When one went out , they all went out . Your outlets may also be wired this way . You must determine which outlet is the first in the row to not be working . Most likely that outlet will be the one that has a loose wire or has become defective or possibly burned . <p> Newer USA outlets have an easier way to install the wires . These outlets save time when installing an outlet but sometimes the wires can come loose . These type of outlets are called back stab or stab-in outlets . If you have these type of outlets then you can check to see if possibly a wire has popped out . Turn off the breaker to the outlet before doing any type of electrical troubleshooting . Remove the 1 screw holding the wall plate on . Remove the 2 screws that hold the outlet in place . Pull out the outlet carefully and check to see if all wires are connected . If you find that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ push the wire back into the connector it came loose from or wire it to the screw connector so it does not pop out again . <p> If you did find an outlet that had a wire come loose and you fixed it , reinstall the outlet and turn the breaker back on . Get a night light or something simple and plug it in and be sure it lights up . If so then check the rest of the outlets and they should all now be working properly . If you encounter a burned outlet , then it will need to be replaced . Remember to always turn off power before doing any electrical work . <p> If none of the above has resolved your power outlet issue , then it may be best to call a professional electrician to be safe . You may have a bad breaker in the breaker box itself or another possibly dangerous wiring issue that should be handled by a professional . <p> If you know of another safe and easy way to troubleshoot and fix an electrical outlet problem , please leave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thanks .

I will test the circuits today with an Electrical receptacle wall plug AC outlet ground test .

When I go to take the outlet out all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Will that remove the power on the outlet so that I can look at it ? I do not want to be electrocuted . <p> Kari Madara , You most likely have one outlet that is faulty or it is disconnected . Yes , flip the breaker to the complete room . MAKE SURE THE POWER IS COMPLETELY TURNED OFF . Then use a meter to be sure the power is off on the outlet you are going to remove . <p> Remove the outlet cover , then remove 1 or 2 screws that hold the actual outlet to the wall , there will be wires inserted into the back of the outlet , be sure they are connected , one may be loose or disconnected . If so reconnect and reinstall . Turn breaker back on and test . If not , the outlet may be faulty and you can simply replace it by seeing how the old wires go into the faulty outlet . Do one wire at a time and wear gloves and use a screwdriver with a rubber handle to be extra safe . Let us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> I had one of this switched in my garage to all the outlet in there and outside . Its tripped before and Ive always reset it . But this time it kept re-tripping every time I reset it . Then after listening to your video I heard about water on the plug could make it trip . Which made me think that my outside plug has an extension cord hooked up to my outside cats heating pad and its been raining . So I wonder if water dripped on the cord female end of the plug and cause the short . I unplugged it and reset it . Behold no trip , so far . <p> I had no power to six outlets . Tried all circuit breakers , they were ok . Tried to reset GFCI . Still no power . Back tracked to a working outlet close or next to the first non working outlet . It was in my case behind the fridge . Pulled the fridge out . Carefully took the cover off and gently twisted the outlet . Granted power was still on , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we had power . We then turned off power to the kitchen outlets . So you do have to know which circuit breaker cuts off power . We then tightened all connections on the fridge outlet and a couple of the non working outlets . Turned circuit breaker back on and we had power to all the outlets . It was just loose connections all along . I guess after 20 yrs things got loose . <p> So I found your comment very useful . I chose a slightly safer approach . After I found out which outlets were dead . I checked the connectors on close by outlets that still have electricity , I turned the power off when working on the outlets <p> I like how you said , " The first thing to do is to unplug everything " . Whenever I work on my wiring I shut the power off . I find that this keeps me safe from being electrified . Also , I wear thick leather gloves for added protection . <p> I did n't  know that turning off and on the breaker resets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ systems . This would really make things simple if you need to reset it . I will have to try this with mine later today . <p> The information about how to fix an outlet that had a loose wire will help me out a lot .

It is estimated that the average water heater temperature is set to 130-F in the United States . 130-F IS THE BEST TEMPERATURE TO SET YOUR WATER HEATER as it will reduce the risk of scalding while showering but also be hot enough to meet your dishwasher and washing machines recommended temperature for an optimum wash cycle . <p> Water Heater Time Temperature Scalding Chart <p> It is acceptable to turn your water heater as high as 140-F if required but higher energy consumption will occur . Be aware that turning up the temperature on your water heater WILL increase your electric or gas bill every month .

Setting the temperature to 140-F can also increase demand losses resulting in an annual expense of up to $500 dollars . One benefit from setting your water heater to 140-F is that this temperature is hot enough to kill almost anything that could be growing inside the water heater itself . If you do decide to raise the temp on your heater for whatever reason , use caution when using faucets , bath tubs , or showers as severe scalding can occur . To minimize the scalding risk , you can install mixing valves or other temperature regulating devices on any taps you use for washing or bathing . <p> Most households can have the temperature set between 120-F and 130-F on their water heaters .

What ended up working for us was plugging it back in again , filling the sink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turning the hex wrench back and forth while I took the stopper out of the drain and let the hot water and soap pour down the drain . It was a solid 2-3 minutes of turning when the water suddenly started draining normally , so he turned it a little more and then tried the disposal and it worked ! We then did the ice cube trick you mentioned above just to make sure whatever was jamming it came out . This was really helpful , thanks ! <p> Thank you so much for this ! I knew about the red button but did n't  know about the hex bolt spot . I thought my Sunday was ruined with the unexpected death of an appliance , but my trusty bicycle allen wrench set ( and your instructions ) saved the day . <p> Dreaded the idea of having to remove the disposal after a ceramic spoon accidentally fell inside the unit . After inspecting and ensuring the disposal was clear of any major shards , I turn on the unit to find it still humming . This google search saved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simple twist of the Allen screw on the bottom of the disposal did the trick . I had forgotten about that tip . Thanks for this helpful post ! <p> Badger 1/3 hp disposal , getting power but wont spin . Cleaned out unit and found some sting got wound up in the disposal . Cleared and still would n't spin but has power . Tried reset , but no difference . Used hex wrench and unit is spinning free and clear . Powered up , still wont spin but has power . Figured some of string may have worked its way under fly wheel so I pulled whole unit out , cleaned thoroughly , took main motor completely off , got under fly wheel and yes , there was a bit of string . Cut out , flywheel spun free and clear . Put whole unit back together , reinstalled , fired it up and yes it still has power but still does n't  want to spin . What could possibly be causing this as I 've troubleshooted everything I can think of . <p> I have an Insinkerator evolution excel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it should . I removed the unit from the mount and loosened mounting screws . Now the vibration is better but the mounting unit moves . I can see the flange turn when unit fires up . When i adjusted it to make the unit snug so it would n't move , the vibration returned . Unit spins freely and there is no debris in the unit . <p> Adam , If your garbage disposal is vibrating excessively , make sure the mount is snug and not damaged . If it is bent the disposal may move and vibrate . Adjust the disposal correctly and then tighten the mounting screws extra tight . If it continues to vibrate , take the disposal out and visually check all parts to see if something is damaged , bent , etc -RR <p> I have a KitchenAid garbage disposal that hums but does not spin . This disposal does not have any space to place hex wrench to unclog it . I have checked there is not anything large blocking the disposal . What do you suggest ? <p> Thank you so much for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wrench for about $7 and loosened the wheels . Reset the switch and when I switched on it worked fine . Thanks for saving me a call to the plumber ! = <p> I was able to freely spin from the bottom using an allen wrench but the humming continued . I then tried to get the blades on by giving it a spin while turned on . This actually caused the humming to stop completely when I flip the switch on now , its totally dead . Hope I did n't  do any harm by attempting to spin it while on ? Thanks so much for this helpful thread . <p> VJ , Try pressing the red reset button at the very bottom of your garbage disposal . If that does not work , make sure the breaker the outlet the disposal is plugged into is not tripped . If power is getting to the garbage disposal and the red reset button did not reset it , you may have a dead disposal . The motor could be faulty . If so it can be repaired by taking it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wiring . The plug could be bad , cord , motor , etc If it is totally dead , buying a new one is a good choice as an average garbage disposal is around $100 US dollars . Let us know what you find . -RR <p> VJ , If your garbage disposal is humming , either it is STILL jammed , or the motor is bad . Remove anything that may be jamming the disposer or test to see if the motor is working properly . You will need a multimeter to do so . -RR <p> Kelly , If the garbage disposal will NOT budge using the wrenchette , then something large is in the disposal that will not let it turn . Unplug the disposer and use something to get down inside to see if you can get the item out that is blocking the disposal from spinning . You can use your hand but be SURE the disposal is unplugged from power . -RR <p> I took the allen wrench and spun it around a couple times , which the motor went with it freely . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . While on , I took the allen wrench and spun it again , and the blades started to spin . Let it run for a few minutes , turned it off . I then turned it back on and the humming started again . The blades will now only spin if I start it with the allen wrench . Is the motor shot ? <p> Tim , If you have exhausted all measures to unjam your disposer , then yes the motor may be fried or on the fritz . You can take it apart and check it with a meter to be sure before replacing it . However there may still be some small foreign object in the disposer binding the cutters . Get the disposer running again with the allen wrench and pour some ice cubes down into it to try to fully clean it out and remove anything that may be binding it up . If the disposer still hums and will not start up after this , it may be time for a new one . Be absolute sure your disposer is not simply jammed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So , let me get this straight ! This person stuck the allen in the bottom , then turned the disposal on , then turned the allen until the disposal stated to run ! Would the allen wrench then turn at the rpm that the motor is spinning ? If so , this sounds a bit unsafe ? I am having the same issue . Is the mechanism where rthe allen is on a some sort of a clutch ? When I spin the shaft with the allen , it spins but seems on the tight side . <p> Charlie , If it feels tight just keep turning as it is jammed and needs to be " moved " using the allen or hex wrench . Common sense would hopefully make people realize that when un-jamming a garbage disposal with an allen wrench under the disposal , it needs to be TURNED OFF . Read the info on the above page and you will see the correct method to unjam a humming disposer.NEVER RUN THE DISPOSAL WHEN REPAIRING OR UNJAMMING IT , UNPLUG IT TO BE SAFE . -RR <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With the disposal OFF , try putting a wooden object down into the disposal and try to spin or turn the cutters to get them un-jammed . Once you have turned them and hopefully un-jammed them Add some liquid soap and turn the disposal on while running water . If it still hums , try tapping on the side of it with a rubber mallet or similar as this may be able to get the disposal spinning again . If this does not work , you may have something really jammed inside the disposal . Unplug the disposal and feel around down inside for something jamming the cutters . Remove the item or items . Plug disposal back in and see if it spins as normal . USE CAUTION WHEN PUTTING YOUR HAND DOWN INTO THE DISPOSAL OPENING . -RR <p> I forgot all about the hex bolt on the bottom . After a couple of hours of stressing out I read your article . A quick twist of an allen wrench and everything is perfectly fine with the dosposal . Thank you . <p> D. Sutton , Have you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Unplug the disposer and feel down inside it to be sure there is nothing jamming it . Then try the allen wrench at bottom to see if it will turn freely . If no jam and the disposer will not turn , try tapping the side of the disposer with a small hammer while it is running and humming . Sometimes a small jolt to it will get it working as the motor could be jammed and a small jolt will get it back spinning . If not then a replacement may be necessary . -RR <p> When I turned on the garbage disposal this morning it made a humming sound . It has done this before and I got it unstuck with the hex wrench . This time the hex wrench turns the unit freely but it still only hums when I turn it on . The reset button is okay . Hmmmm .. fried ? <p> Jon , If the disposal turns freely with the hex wrench and it still hums , the motor may be bad or fried as you stated . It may have overheated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if that is the case . Give it a few hours and try again , if it still hums and spins freely then remove and replace after doing some further troubleshooting. -RR <p> I loosened the disposal by using the Wrenchette . When I turned it back on , it made a noise and the blade inside the disposer seems to be extremely loose and rattles . Can I tighten it ? Or what should I do ? <p> Joan , The disposal was jammed so you used the wrench on the bottom to get it to spin again , correct ? Was there any type of rattling before this ? You may have something that has fallen into the disposer such as a small metal object or similar . Unplug disposal and check with flashlight in the disposal . See if there is anything in there that should not be . If nothing visual is causing the rattle , you may have loose chopper or motor . Check that nothing is in there rattling first If still rattles , let us know what make and model your disposer is and we can assist further . -RR

Please leave a question or comment below and we can assist . <p> I have a Samsung DMT610RHS dishwasher . It has never really done a great job of cleaning the dishes however the biggest problem is that it would simply shut off during the cycle . Not necessarily in the same spot . I would open the door and the panel would re-engage at different stages of the door opening . When I would close the door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in awhile , I could re engage it and the cycle would finish .

I tried flipping the breaker but it sounded like it was cycling without water ( whether the door was open or closed ) and kept flashing . <p> Sue , Samsung Dishwasher F3 is a water leak in the base . Water has overflowed when the bowl water went into the dishwasher and will have leaked into the base . Pull the dishwasher out and tip it 45 degs backwards . This will allow the water to drain out . Once the water is out of the dishwasher , the antiflood switch will reset itself and the dishwasher should work .

Uninstall the unit and tip the dishwasher on its left side to drain all the water out . Then reinstall the dishwasher and see if the error comes back . If it does then that requires the main circulation pump assembly to be replaced to fix the error . -RR <p> I have Samsung dishwasher DW80J994 series . Its made a little noise for last couple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ front led light started flashing about 1mn into running and at same time it beeps 3 times . No error code but it does really run the cycle . After a few mins ill open the door and timer is same at start i also have n't noticed any lights on . Ive checked nozzle clearance and bottom drain filter . No issues . Extra note : I put about 3 cups of water in the bottom and it worked fine . <p> Also having the same issue . It sounds like the noise is the pump trying to pump water out of unit but no water is left in it . Prior to starting cycle a bunch of pre-checks occur with these . One of them is to check for water from a previous cycle and if it exists pump it out . I suspect the issue may be the water fill sensor . I 'm calling tech support . Will update if they fix it . <p> As usual , it starts draining but after the 30 usual seconds even though all water is gone it still tries to drain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while it keeps trying to drain . Ca n't turn it off unless I use the breaker . Following the wrong suggestion ( by Samsung ! ) I already replaced the drain pump . As you suggested , I took the control board out . Everything looks good , nothing is disconnected unless there is a pro way to test it , I 'm the most amateur guy you 've ever talked to . What 's the next step/suggestion ? Do I have to replace the control board even though visually looks good ? Its $161 . There is no version model between the model # and SN . Model is dw80f600uts/aa . I saw online that the replacement is the one that has the same sticker inside that says R4 F600 , I checked mine against the pic of that one and they look exactly the same . <p> My Samsung dishwasher model is DW80F600UTS/AA . The Smart Auto and Heavy lights flash right after trying to run it . The first thing done was to turn the breaker off for 20 minutes without success . After checking in the manual and speaking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was a draining issue . By that time there was some leftover of water at the bottom . Since what needed to be done was cleaning and replacing the drain pump , I did it myself following some good detail explanatory videos . Now that everything under the sump filter and also everything under it was cleaned and the drain pump was replaced , it still shows the same error code but there is no water at the bottom . What can it possibly be the issue if its not the drain pump ? While lights keep flashing , the unit still tries to drain but there is no water left inside . There is no sign that there is water draining to the sinks pipe ( usually I can hear the water draining ) . Right after I set it up to run the lights start flushing and it does n't  even start . <p> Uriel , Does water enter into the Samsung dishwasher at all ? Is the drain pump turning ON at the correct moment , but keeps running even after all the water has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ control board that is causing the drain pump to run continuously . Have you opened up the front panel and visually inspect ? There could be a stuck or faulty relay on the control board . -RR <p> THANK YOU ! ! ! ! This explains why it works after we transported it to our tech guy ! And can you please help me with a reason why the salt light does n't  go of after a refill .

I appreciate any and all help . <p> Mike Calloway , There is a sensor in that particular Samsung DW80F600 Series dishwasher . The error code relates to a DRAIN issue but it has been known to be a dirty sensor if the dishwasher is draining with no problem . <p> To fix this error code on your Samsung Dishwasher : Remove the sensor and you will most likely find some buildup on it . Clean the sensor off and put sensor back into place . You can access the sensor by removing the sump filter at bottom . If you have issues finding the sensor , check your Samsung dishwasher DW80F600 manual here . -RR <p> Just purchased a Samsung black stainless steel dishwasher model : dw80j7550ug about 6 months ago .

I poured some water into the bottom of the dishwasher , then I pressed the power button , then pressed start and closed the door . <p> The display showed " 1 " again , then the pump started to run and pumped all of the water out of the bottom of the washer and stopped for a second or two , then either the pump started to run again or the arm was trying to move to make sure nothing was blocking it .

Either that or the start button was pressed 2 times and it is in a delay or pause mode . Have you tried unplugging for 10 minutes , plug back in , shut dishwasher door , let sit 30 minutes . What happens ? Still all 4 flashing ? -RR <p> All buttons on the panel appear unresponsive when powering off/on from the breaker .

From the start it did not wash anything on the bottom rack well at all and it seems the waterwall was not cycling . After a few service calls the following things have been replaced : Main bored , Vain assembly , Nozzle cover , lower nozzle assembly , and rail assembly . ( not in that order ) . After the last call it does n't  run at all . Looking into it more it seems that the waterwall cycles ( loudly ) but no water comes on . I put my phone in to verify and the waterwall will move forward and back . it sounds like the water is trying to come on but nothing . Then the same error pops up that the waterwall can not cycle . I know the water is getting from the line to the dishwasher . Any ideas ? There ca n't be too many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Water Inlet Valve not changed ? That is what supplies the water into the dishwasher . Did you forget to mention that was replaced ? Check the water line for bends or crimps . To be sure water is getting into the dishwasher , turn the water supply to it off , then remove the water line from the bottom of dishwasher . Then using a bucket to collect the water , turn on the water supply to be sure it is flowing . If it is , then the water inlet valve is bad or something is clogged up . -RR <p> I will try the water inlet value . I did already make sure water was getting to the dishwasher by the above method . I then poured that water into the dishwasher to verify it was draining , which it did fine . Do you happen to have a PN on the water inlet ? <p> So , here is an update .

Have already had to have work done on it once and it is less than 5 yrs old . <p> Mary Ard , The flashing SMART AUTO / NORMAL lights on your Samsung dishwasher means a HIGH TEMP ERROR . To fix it you need to clean or replace the ECS sensor . The sensor is located under the sump , and can be accessed by removing a few screws . Remember to disconnect power when working on your dishwasher . The ECS sensor is around 30 dollars . -RR <p> On a Samsung Dishwasher , when the Heavy and Delicate lights are blinking , this means an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reasons for this error : <p> 1 The water entering the dishwasher is not warm enough . Try turning off power to the dishwasher for 15 seconds and then back on . Before restarting the dishwasher , run hot water in the sink . When the water from the sink is hot , turn off the faucet and start the dishwasher . This should prevent the Heavy and Delicate lights blinking error from happening as hot water is now entering the dishwasher . <p> I have a Samsung dishwasher model DMT610RHS/XAC . Its flashing error code CE . Have turned off power to dishwasher to hopefully reset . Turned power back on , and once you touch the power button again the CE code appears again ; the motor goes for a few seconds then stops , then it goes one for a few seconds more and again it stops all the while the CE code continues to flash . This d/washer has a pain from day one I could say a lot more but that 's time I 'll never get back . Hoping you can help me . <p> John @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water temperature . Possibly the heating element or a thermistor may need to be replaced . Check to be sure your dishwasher is getting hot enough water from the start also . -RR <p> I 've got the same thing . I discovered that my dishwasher works fine if I remove the upper rack . As soon as I put it back in and try it , boom oE code . Seems like the high pressure jet of water that is supposed to spin the upper rack sprayer causes the error code . Probably to do with the flow restricting as it enters the spinning bit . <p> I do n't  know how to fix it yet , but at least Ive got some idea on what is going wrong ( in one case anyway ) . <p> Cathy , Samsung Dishwasher Error code " over fill " ( flashing smart auto and heavy lights ) cycle does n't  start in time for water to reach over fill sensor . The easiest fix for this is to replace the ECS sensor . -RR <p> My Samsung wont allow me to change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does nothing . Consequently its stuck on a program I would n't normally use . Has anyone any ideas on this one , please ? Thanks so much = <p> My Samsung DMT800RHS dishwasher stopped during a normal wash cycle . The WASH light is rapidly blinking and the control touch pad is totally unresponsive . I cut power to the dishwasher using the circuit breaker but when the washer came back on in was still blinking WASH and unresponsive so not even power reset cleared the fault . What is causing this ? Is it anything but the main control board ? <p> John Trembley , Give it some time . At times the washer will blink when the door is shut . Try unplugging it again for 30 minutes . Plug back in and if the blinking persists , leave the dishwasher for a few hours . If the blinking does not stop , please let us know if any other buttons are blinking and if there is a pattern to the blinking . Is it a constant blink or is it blinking a number of times and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number of times it blinks if applicable ? Let us know . -RR <p> The blinking is constant at around 2 blinks per second . I 've left it powered off for over and hour and problem still persists . Only the WASH light blinks . There is an audible clicking with each blink . I have removed the reinstalled both the touchpad and the main control board without any different result . There was no obvious damage to either board . It would help if I knew what diagnostics could be run on the boards with a multi-meter . <p> Jim Anderson , Have you tried unplugging the dishwasher from power to see if that will reset it ? If the dishwasher drains when the dishwasher starts , that may indicate there is an issue with the control panel / board . -RR <p> I have checked and cleaned all hoses thoroughly . I run another cycle with the dishwasher pulled out from under the cabinet , so there was no kink in the hose . It washes fine until time to drain and I get another SE code . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ checked the pump and there is no problem with it . <p> Evelyn Server , Even though you are getting the error code SE on your Samsung dishwasher , does the dishwasher actually drain the water out at the end of the cycle or is the error code appearing and in reality , there is no problem with the dishwasher besides the error showing up ? OR Is the dishwasher washing normally , rinses , but when it comes to drain , it DOES NOT drain and immediately after you receive the SE error code ? If the error code is showing , it MAY be possible that the sensor is not working as designed , but that is very unusual if that is the case . We would think there still is a problem with the drain pump , hose or possibly in the wall where the water drains . Could there be a blockage down the line that is causing your issue ? You have checked ALL hoses , water lines , and taken the pump apart and checked for foreign objects stuck in it and also made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be an excessive amount of water in the bottom of your dishwasher after a cycle has been completed ? <p> My Samsung dishwasher is flashing a SE code . I have made sure the drain hose is clear , I have checked the pump . The pump is okay . The machine goes thru the cycle until it needs to drain the water and that is when it displays the SE code . <p> Evelyn Server , Yes SE error code on a Samsung dishwasher means a drain error . What exactly did you check with the pump ? Getting power , proper voltage , checked for foreign objects blocking it , wiring ? The drain hose may be clear , but be sure it is not getting crimped or pinched when the dishwasher is back in place . -RR

Maybe you have stripped a screw on your mobile device such as an iPhone or taking apart a household appliance . We have all been in a situation where time is a factor and a screw becomes stripped . What is the easiest and fastest method to remove it ? That answer depends on what type of screw or fastener you have stripped . No matter what type of screw you have stripped ( Phillips head , Flat , or Straight head ) these screw removal methods will help you to extract it quickly . Use the list below to find the best method to remove that stripped screw or bolt no matter what your situation is . <p> Rubber Band This screw removal method is done by putting the rubber band over the stripped screw . Put your screwdriver over it and with the rubber band between the screw and the screwdriver push with heavy force and turn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stripped screw . Hammer the end of the screwdriver . This may work by getting the screw driver to go into the soft metal of the screw allowing you the added grip to screw it out . <p> Epoxy Glue Glue a nut on top of the screw . You can also use a strong adhesive like JB Weld also . Once the glue or adhesive is dry and set , use a wrench to turn the nut and hopefully it will hold and unscrew the screw with it . <p> Screw Extractor This is a special tool that is made for the purpose of removing stripped screws . These would be " easy outs , grabits , left twists , reverse bits , and vampliers " . These all can do the job of removing screws but should be purchased before hand and kept in your toolbox for future screw and bolt extraction issues . <p> Drill Hole In Screw You can use a drill bit slightly smaller than the screw head . Drill a small hole into the center of the screw head . This method works by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the screw to unscrew it . <p> Size Bigger Screwdriver If you have a stripped Phillips head screw , sometimes using a size bigger Phillips screwdriver can give you the extra grip needed to get the screw out . Maybe even try a smaller Phillips also . <p> Grip With Pliers If the head of the screw is slightly above the hole , you can use a pair of pliers or vise grips to securely grab the screw head and turn it out . This is the easiest method if the screw is stripped but the head is sticking out above the hole . <p> Grinding Tool If you have a grinding tool like a Ryobi or Dremel tool , you can use one of the cutter blades to cut a straight notched line on the screw head . The deeper you make the notch the easier it will be to remove the screw . <p> Weld It If you know how to weld and heat will not damage the device the screw is in , weld a nut or piece of metal to the screw . Once welded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ piece and the screw will be extracted . <p> Drill Head Off Screw Use a drill and as a last resort , drill the head of the screw completely off . Use a smaller drill bit than the width of the screw so you do not drill the threads out on the device the screw is in . Do not drill deep and you only want to remove the screw head . When the screw head is removed , the shaft of the screw should be sticking out . You should be able to grip it with a pair of pliers and unscrew it out . <p> Below are 3 different charts to help you better understand what type of screw head and screw type you are working with . If you need to go to buy a screw extractor kit , use the charts below to know what type of kit you may need as extractor kits differ slightly . <p> Got a great tip we do n't  have listed here to remove a stuck screw ?

I am now desperate . <p> Meg , Use a cordless drill with a small drill bit and drill completely into the screw . If you find the perfect thickness of drill bit , it will drill it out so the threads are removed from the screw , therefore it will come out . Use a smaller drill bit first , and slowly go to a thicker drill bit until the screw is able to be removed . Use caution that you do not damage the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ damaged as someone has glued the screw in place .

Spray the bolt and let the penetrating spray sit for 20 minutes , wipe off any left over and try heating the bolt . They try your impact driver with extra strong bits . DO not use the bits you get in a 100 pack for $5 dollars . Have you tried screw/bolt extractor bits ? -RR <p> Kim , Corroded as in rust ? If the screws are in an oven , they should not be corroded .

@@13196710 @1796710/ <h> What To Do If A Room Is Hotter Than The Rest Of Your House In The Summer <p> If you have a bedroom , basement , or any room in your house that is much hotter than the rest of your home in summer , here are some suggestions and tips to resolve the problem . <p> The easiest solution is The air vents ( aka registers ) that are installed on the walls of your home have controllable vents that can be open , closed , and also direct the air by moving the small slider on the vent itself . Sometimes the best solution for fixing a room hotter than the rest of the house is by simply opening the air vent all the way . You may need to slightly restrict or fully close the vents in a few other rooms of your house to get more cooled air into the room that is too hot . Fully closing the bathroom air vent is acceptable because when the fan in the ceiling is on , it is sucking out some of the cold air anyway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lower to make your whole home cooler . Please note this will increase the workload of your air conditioning unit and make your electricity bills higher . This is only recommended as a temporary solution if you have no other choice . <p> If you can allow the door to your room to be open , consider putting a fan in the hallway and direct the airflow into the hot room . Any type of fan will work for this but a box fan should work the best . This should allow the cooler air in the hallway enter your hot room therefore cooling it off . <p> If you do n't  care about appearance , you can REMOVE the air vent completely as the vent cover actually restricts airflow . There are 2 small metal screws holding the vent into the wall . You will need either a flat or Phillips screwdriver to remove the screws . Then grab something to stand on to get up to the air vent , remove the screws , and take the vent completely off . Do not remove the vent cover while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into your eyes . <p> If all else fails , you may need your air ducts cleaned by a professional . There may be a massive amount of dust inside the ducts thus restricting maximum airflow . <p> A reason why your room may be hotter than the other rooms of the house is caused by electronics such as computers and TVs . Anything electronic generates excessive heat especially computers . One tip to implement is to turn your computer completely off when not using it . A large desktop computer can actually raise a rooms temperature by as much as 5 to 15 degrees . Lamps and anything containing a light bulb will also generate heat . Turn off anything that could be generating heat that could be raising the temperature in the room . <p> If opening the vents and turning off electronics in the room do not help with cooling it off , consider a window mounted AC . This obviously is not the best option but it will fix the issue . Many small AC window units are under $200 and are somewhat efficient when considering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ installed and you do not have to have it running all the time . Some have thermostats on them and some simply have an on/off switch .

The best and most efficient way of doing this is with a Rototiller . Rent a high quality rototiller and use it to remove the exiting grass and weeds . It is a good idea to cut down about 2 to 3 inches into the soil so you have a fresh surface to lay down your new sod . After you have tilled the ground , use a metal bow rake and smooth the soil .

If you feel any slight resistance then you will know the roots are anchored in the soil . NOTE : Watering frequency of sod will depend on the rainfall frequency where you live as more rain will mean less watering manually . <p> The best time to lay sod is spring and early autumn because cooler temperatures and occasional rain help the sod quickly root into the soil .

@@13196725 @1796725/ <h> 5 Ways To Fix A Refrigerator Leaking Water <p> A refrigerator leaking water on the floor can be an electric shock and slipping hazard . This issue needs to be fixed immediately to avoid causing injury . There are different areas a water leak will be coming from on your refrigerator . Knowing where the leak is coming from will help you to diagnose what could be wrong with your fridge . A rear water leak usually means the ice maker or water line is at fault . A leak coming from the front of the refrigerator usually means that a drain tube is clogged . A leak from the very bottom center of the refrigerator usually is caused by the drain pan having a crack or not being in the proper position . A water leak inside your refrigerator will usually occur if the drain line from the defroster is routed on the inside of your refrigerator . <p> Since there are many different types of refrigerators , these troubleshooting tips and ideas will help you to get to the root of the problem and you may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fix the problem . Consulting your refrigerator owners manual will assist in fixing your specific model . <p> 1 . Fix water leak from front of lower refrigerator : <p> This usually means that your refrigerator is a self defrosting model and the drain line has become clogged . The easiest way to fix this is to unplug the fridge , remove the front plastic guard on the front of the fridge . Once removed there should be a plastic tray that slides out . Search for the end of the drain line . Once found put the end of the drain in an empty bucket . Next remove the top portion of the drain tube . Inspect for any chunks of ice that can be clogging the line . If ice is found , run the area of the line with ice under hot water to melt it . Once the clog is removed , reinstall the drain line and check periodically for leaks . <p> 2 . Repair water leaking from very bottom of refrigerator : <p> This usually means that there is a hole or crack in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be positioned wrong so the water is going directly on the floor . NOTE : Some refrigerators have the drain pan ( condensate pan ) mounted directly on the compressor . The drain pan catches any water that may be leaking downward from the fridge . When water is on the floor , fix this by doing a visual inspection on the drain pan making sure there are no cracks or holes . Be sure to make sure it is positioned correctly if it is not mounted to the compressor . Excessive humidity can create more water going into the drain pan . When water enters the drain pan , it will evaporate from the heat the refrigerator is producing below and you will never even notice there is water there . So , if you find water under the drain pan , just make sure it not damaged . Check periodically to be sure the leak has stopped . <p> 3 . Fix water that is leaking from back rear of the refrigerator : <p> A rear water leak on your fridge will almost always mean the water valve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unplug the refrigerator and check the water line coming from the wall to the fridge . Also check the water line that goes from the bottom of the fridge and then enters the back of the freezer . The solenoid that opens and closes the water valve can also be leaking . Another leak can occur on the valve in the wall that turns the water on and off for the ice maker and water dispenser . If you have a water filter installed on the water line , check to be sure the connections are tight . Check anywhere that water flows and be sure there are no holes in the water line . Also check to be sure a water line has not pulled out and is leaking directly onto the floor . If holes are found , replace the water line . <p> 4 . Repair water leak on inside of refrigerator : <p> This will usually mean that the drain line from the defroster is routed inside the fridge and it is clogged . Most drain line outlets are located behind the refrigerator crisper drawers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outlet . Once found get a mirror and try to look inside the top of the drain outlet . Inspect for anything that may be clogging it . If nothing is found , remove the drain line from the other end so you can pour hot water into the outlet and it will come out of the drain line on the other side . This should remove any junk that may be clogging the line . You can also use a mini plumbers snake to make this easier . If you do not have this then a hard long piece of wire can be used . Once the clog is removed put everything back together and periodically check for leaks . <p> 5 . Water excessively drips from bottom of fridge : <p> This can be caused by bad door gaskets . If outside air is entering your refrigerator through worn or ripped door gaskets , it will cause excessive moisture in your fridge causing water to drip down and overfill the drain pan . When the drain pan overflows , it has nowhere else to go but onto your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the door gaskets can also cause this . If your fridge door does not shut properly , from bad gaskets or similar , excessive moisture will occur . To fix this problem you can simply replace the door gaskets . You can also make sure the bolts that hold the door on your refrigerator are tight and holding the door secure . Refrigerator door gaskets can be found online for a reasonable price . <p> If you know of other reasons water will leak from a refrigerator and ways to fix them , please leave a comment below . <p> I have a 5 door , 26.8 ft French door Whirlpool refrigerator . We just noticed water coming up through the vinyl flooring planks . Rolled it out and noticed water pooling on the bottom right rear , near the water inlet hoses , with moisture on the copper tubing . Having a repairman come out tomorrow . Two weeks left on warranty . Shutting the water off seems to stop the leaking . On an expensive refrigerator , I want the water on . <p> What I find odd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and there is a large square hole next to it . I can see my floor through the hole . The water has apparently been dripping , pooling , and going out through that hole . Why is there a large square hole in that spot . Of course the water will drain onto the floor . <p> I have a Whirlpool side by side fridge I just hooked up the water to it and when I turned the water on it spewed out all over the place . I found that the water valve that has 2 sets of wires and 3 hoses going to it was cracked I replaced it with an oem one and replaced the filter being worried about any other leaks I really watched everything underneath and I noticed that every few minutes a drip or so comes out of the oval opening on the bottom of the filter housing and drips into the catch pan is that normal or is there an issue with the filter housing now ? <p> I believe it is Hotpoint that makes or made a fridge that defrosts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the top ) and the refrigerator portion . It does not have an exterior drain tube or pan . The water will then find its way down , during defrost cycle , to the fridge where the warmer air prevents it from freezing and causes it to pool at the bottom or in the crisper drawers . Sometimes chipping out the ice by hand works , but I believe it is caused by a worn Styrofoam vent gasket in the back of the freezer . As of yet , I have not figured out a way to fix this .

@@13196727 @1796727/ <h> How To Test A Capacitor <p> To test a capacitor to see if it is working , you will first need an ohmmeter/multimeter . You will be taking a measurement/reading of the electrical resistance . The reading on your multimeter will tell you if the capacitor is working properly or needs to be replaced . Please Note : This procedure for testing to see if a capacitor is good is meant for appliance troubleshooting such as a refrigerator run start capacitor with only 2 leads . <h> To test a capacitor : <p> Be sure power is turned off to the appliance and unplugged from the wall . This needs to be done when you remove any type of capacitor from any type of appliance . Once the appliance is unplugged , wait about 30 minutes after removing power before you pull the capacitor out . A capacitor on any appliance such as a refrigerator run start , washing machine motor , or microwave oven , can hold a lethal electrical charge . Waiting 30 minutes or longer will lessen the risk before you remove it . Take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make contact with the leads . Depending on the type of appliance you are working on , you may need to discharge the power from the capacitor . Here is a step-by-step procedure for how to discharge a capacitor . <p> NOTE : At times , some older types of capacitors will not need to be tested with a multimeter . This is because when some capacitors go bad , they will bulge out . You only need to do a quick visual check to see if this is the case . If the capacitor in your refrigerator is bulging , then it has gone bad and you will need to replace it . <p> Once you have the capacitor out , use your multimeter to see if the capacitor is in working condition . First , be sure to set your multimeter to ohms . Some multimeters have more settings , so to be exact somewhere over 10k and 1m ohms or select a higher setting of ohms . Use the same procedure whether you are using an analog meter or digital multimeter as you are testing for electrical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the black lead to the negative side of the capacitor and the red lead to the positive side . The writing or markings on the capacitor leads will most likely be a ( + ) and a ( - ) . The ( + ) is obviously the positive , and the ( - ) is the negative . Once you have the leads on the capacitor , have a look at the meter reading . If the meter shows zero ( 0 ) and then moves slowly towards infinite , then the capacitor is working and does NOT need to be replaced . If the multimeter reading stays at zero ( 0 ) and does not move at all , then this indicates the capacitor is not working ( open capacitor ) and needs to be replaced . If the meter reading shows a very low resistance , the capacitor is shorted out . If you need to replace your refrigerator capacitor , there are many available online for less . <p> This method of testing refrigerator capacitors will work on all models of refrigerators such as GE , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kenmore , and many others . <p> WARNING When you replace a capacitor make ABSOLUTE sure to replace it with one that is the exact same value or a higher value .

If there is still sagging see the next method below for fixing your door . <p> Add a few cardboard shims under the door hinge to stop sagging <p> If your door has no cracks on the frame and the hinges are in good shape and the screws are tight and the correct length , try the next method . This is super easy and will fix your door from sagging and hitting the frame . This is called the FIX YOUR SAGGING DOOR WITH CARDBOARD SHIMS METHOD . <p> First , get a cardboard box or any cardboard you have around the house . Use a box cutter ( on a hard surface ) and cut a few pieces of the cardboard to the shape of the door hinge . Make them around a 1/4 ? smaller than the actual door hinge so no cardboard protrudes from behind the hinge . OK , now you need to make the holes in the cardboard that match the holes on your door hinges . Make one template and then if needed use that to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shim to fix your sagging door <p> Next , you need to figure out which hinge needs the shim . You can simply take the screws out of one hinge without removing the complete door . Just remove the screws , pull the door out VERY CAREFULLY just enough to slide your cardboard shim underneath it . Once the cardboard is in place , screw the hinge back on with the shim underneath . It helps to have someone assisting you at this point to hold the door steady . <p> Lifting a Sagging Door : Door Installation &amp; MaintenanceLifting a sagging door is something you can do easy by replacing the screws with longer ones <p> If the top of the door ( above where the lock and door handle are located ) is hitting or rubbing the top edge of the door frame , then you need to add a cardboard shim to the very bottom hinge . This will make the door push slightly outward from the bottom meaning the top will be pushed slightly inward . If you have the perfect shim or shims thickness , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of your door ( below where the lock and door handle are located ) is hitting or rubbing the bottom of the door frame , then you need to add a cardboard shim to the very bottom and possibly the middle hinge also . The solution to this is to push the door outward from the lower hinge therefore squaring it up and stopping the sagging . <p> Once you have the cardboard shims in place , make sure the door has stopped sagging . If not , you may need to add more cardboard behind the door hinge to push it outward even further . <p> NOTE : Usually your door will be out of alignment or sagging by just a few fractions of an inch . So you may NOT need thick cardboard . You can use a piece of thin cardboard from anything in your house including a cereal or instant rice box or similar . <p> Using a cardboard shim would be incredibly simple . I will have to try this technique on my dads door at his house . It hangs down low on one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think I have a box in my storeroom I could use for the job . <p> I thought that repairing a sagging door would be kind of tough , so its good to know that its actually easier than I thought . Making a cardboard shim to prevent my door from sagging seems really easy . The bottom of my door hits the bottom of the door frame , so now I know that I 'll need to install a shim not just to the bottom of the door , but also to the middle hinge . Ill be sure to try that to see if it will push my door outward enough to stop it from sagging . <p> Even after replacing the hinges ( which made an obvious improvement on the door sagging ) we still had problems with the lock aligning properly . I 'm starting to wonder if it is possible that the very door frame has changed shape , but it became clear that fixing the sagging wasnt going to be enough . Were probably going to need to replace the whole frame and install a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some basic door repair ! Ive been struggling with a sagging bathroom door lately , and this seems like it might help . It would be great if I could fix it this weekend ! Unfortunately , my front door is also having issues .

There can only be a number of things that can make your dishwasher leak . The leak may be coming from either the front of the dishwasher or from a component or part from the bottom . You will have to find the leak and repair either a seal , a hose , pump , or other misc part . See below to fix your dishwasher that is leaking water . <h> DOOR SEALS LEAKING ? <p> If water is showing up on the kitchen floor in front of the dishwasher then it may be a leaking door seal that is causing your leak . To find out , open the dishwasher door and check to be sure that the seal around the front door is not ripped or worn . If you identify an area of the door seal that is damaged , you should remove and replace it as this is the cause of your leak . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dishwasher , it is something leaking under the tub . The most common components to leak is the water pump seal and or the water inlet valve . SEE BELOW . <h> WRONG DETERGENT ? <p> Before taking your dishwasher apart , be sure you are using the correct detergent . The wrong detergent can cause excessive suds . When the suds overflow they can show up as a drip . So be sure you are using the correct detergent . <h> WATER VALVE LEAKING ? <p> To check to see if a water inlet valve is leaking remove the bottom plate on the front of your dishwasher and check the water valve . A bad water inlet valve will usually be a slow drip coming from the top of the valve . Look for a hard water material or corrosion on the valve itself . If you find a bad water valve ( solenoid valve ) , shut off the water supply and replace the valve as soon as possible . <h> PUMP SEALS LEAKING ? <p> There is a water pump in your dishwasher . The seals on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rubber and over time will leak . A pump seal leak can be identified as water dripping from the motor or the pump housing . If your pump leaks around the seals , remove it and replace the seals to prevent any further leakage . <h> HOSES LEAKING ? <p> The leak may be coming from a recirculation hose or drain hose . These hoses are made from rubber or plastic and crack open to cause your leak . To fix this problem simply replace the faulty hose or hoses . <h> BAD OR STUCK FLOAT SWITCH ? <p> Check the float switch in the bottom of your dishwasher . Make sure it is not stuck on something and be sure the switch is working properly . Test the float switch for continuity if you have a suspicion it is not working properly . Replace the float switch if it is bad . <h> OTHER LEAKING COMPONENT ? <p> If none of the above parts or areas were leaking , remove the dishwasher and troubleshoot : <p> My Kitchenaid only leaks at startup at the bottom of door . Replaced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of door . Cleaned float and checked float switch . Tighten all screws on door and around the pump and screen housing .

It only leaks when the arm is in motion . I looked under the tub and noticed that it looks likes it was a slow leak that has gotten worse . I have not yet pulled the dishwasher out to see exactly what is leaking , I just wonder if I should just have it replaced . I can do small repairs that do n't  call for strength and am afraid to pull it out . <p> Vickie Minchew , It may just need a part like the pump or the water inlet valve tightened .

You most likely have a loose water hose . If leaking from the bottom of the Beko washer , then look under the washer as there may be a component leaking such as the water lines on the drain pump or other water lines that fill or drain your washer. -RR <p> My dishwasher was leaking a lot .

The water seems to come from directly underneath the float valve because its right behind the front wheel . It only leaks some times . Sometimes its just a little water and other times its a lot of water . Or would this be a door leak and its just running back ? <p> Shelly , There is a seal that goes under the float valve . Yours may be worn and causing the leak . Replace if necessary . If it is coming from the door seal , there would be obvious signs of wear on the seal . If so , replace . -RR <p> I ran my dishwasher while I was running some errands , and when I came home , there was water all over the floor . Never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not sure where to start ! I do n't  think it is the detergent we are using , we have used the same kind since we got it , and it just started . I 'm wondering if the seal around the door is leaking . The water is all in front of the dishwasher . <p> Addie , You either have a leak under the dishwasher where the water and drain connects . If the dishwasher front seal was worn and needed to be replaced it would have obvious signs of rips , or missing parts . First , clean the water from the floor . Run your dishwasher on the shortest setting and use a flashlight and watch under the dishwasher to see if you spot dripping water . If it leaks from the bottom then you will need to troubleshoot where the leak is originating from . If it is coming from the front door seal , remove and replace the seal . -RR

Try and find any firmware upgrades for your Sanyo TV . It might simply be an issue with the TV needing updated .

Maybe time for a new TV , eh <p> Michael , It may be the component you are trying to use to watch TV . If after some troubleshooting you find the external components ( DVD , Cable box , SAT box ) working and the cables are not damaged and they are plugged in and secure , then try a factory reset on your TV and that MAY solve your issue .

Can you help ? <p> Heather Smith , It sounds as if you have an issue with the sound control board in the TV . If you have to wait for the TV to produce sound , then the sound processing board may be on the fritz and may need to be replaced . You could also have a bad wiring connection to the sound board or speakers . Use caution when opening up your TV to work on it . Unplug TV and wait an hour before opening up the TV to troubleshoot the problem .

Tried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so had to phone Toshiba as was just inside the warranty . They suggested to rescan for channels as the TV needs to update periodically . Tried it and it worked . I assume this is some sort of " feature " although slightly annoying .

When I turn up the volume on the TV all I hear is a ringing noise that increases as I turn up volume on TV . I do have a PC Audio jack on the side of my TV , but when I plug a speaker into it nothing happens with regards to the sound .

Try using a different audio output jack and hook up surround sound or a sound bar . If the audio output jack does not work , then yes you may need to turn the TV speaker off in the menu . If nothing works to get your TVs audio working , the audio board in the TV may also be bad . It may be best to buy a new TV as replacing boards in a TV is hit and miss and the time and money you waste to fix your TV could be invested in a new TV . Do some further troubleshooting and you may get the TV audio or sound to begin working again . -RR <p> I have an LG TV . The volume was cranked up all way while playing with the WII .

I have two questions 1 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buy a soundbar , will it work ? <p> Lalji , 1 If the sound is crackling , then the TV speaker is probably blown . You could buy a new aftermarket speaker and install it in your LG TV. 2 If you buy a sound bar , it will work as the problem seems to be with the TV speaker itself . A sound bar will connect into the audio input and you should be able to have sound this way if the TV speaker is blown . -RR <p> I a Toshiba and i was playing my ps2 .

You will have to do some troubleshooting to find the exact issue . What is the model number of your Toshiba TV ? -RR <p> Mary Cunningham , If you have tried all the above steps , you could try unplugging the TV and plugging back in . If that still does not work , you may have a speaker that is not working , a loose or damaged wire harness in the TV , or the audio board may not be operating properly . Further troubleshooting will be required . -RR <p> Kimberly Haughton , Are you using any type of external speakers with your Toshiba Smart TV ? If so check the surround sound component to be sure it is set correctly .

Are you trying to watch a DVD or CABLE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to CABLE , SAT , NETFLIX , DVD , or any other component to be sure that it is the TV having the issue and not an external component . If the TV speaker does not work no matter what you try , do an experiment and connect an external speaker to the TV to see if sound will be heard . If not you may have a circuit board issue or possibly the speakers in the TV have a wiring issue . Try everything first before taking the TV apart to check the speakers . Usually it is a simple solution and does not involve taking anything apart . Please let us know if you have sound from your TV or not and we can assist further if needed . -RR <p> Shannon Gardner , Go into the menu settings of your cable box and make sure the audio is set correctly , if it is then check that the cable going to and from the cable box is not damaged and it is connected to the cable box and the TV .

If no sound from sound bar then make sure sound bar audio connection is connected and secure . -RR <p> Allan , On some older LCD TVs , the built in TV speaker has to be off for the " audio out " jacks to work on the back or side of the TV .

Here are some simple quick tips that can help you fix your disposal fast and easy yourself without calling a plumber and having to spend a lot of money on repairs . Garbage Disposer Humming ? <p> IF THE GARBAGE DISPOSAL IS SPINNING AND SOUNDS NORMAL First try a quick fix by cleaning out the disposer and the waste lines . The easiest is to run ice cubes in the garbage disposal . Fill the garbage disposal with the ice cubes and run the water . Then turn on the garbage disposal until the grinding stops . This should clear out the lines and water should drain from your sink . Another method is to run hard pasta in your disposal . Pour a bag of uncooked pasta in the disposal and run it while running the water . If neither of these simple procedures work , see below for more ways to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NO NOISE WHEN YOU TURN IT ON First thing is to check the breaker in the house to make sure it did not trip . If the breaker is on then .. There is usually a red reset button on the very bottom of every garbage disposal ( locate the disposal under your sink and find the reset button at the very bottom of the disposer itself ) . The reset button will stick out from the bottom of the disposal . Once located press the red reset button and test the disposal for proper operation . <p> Red Reset Button On The Bottom Of A Garbage Disposal <p> IF THE GARBAGE DISPOSAL IS NOT SPINNING ( HUMMING ) This means that the motor is not able to spin the disposer wheel . The first thing you should try is to insert an allen wrench ( that came with your disposer ) into the center of the bottom of the garbage disposal . While the wrench is in place , turn the wrench in a clockwise motion until it spins freely . If this test makes the disposer spin , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your disposal . If you do not have the allen wrench that came with your disposal , then you can use a wooden kitchen spoon . Unplug the disposal and put the end of the spoon into the sink hole and into the disposal . Try turning the wheel with the spoon . If this does not work then another method is to use a flashlight and look into the disposal and see if there is any large items that are preventing it from spinning . If you find something , remove it with a pair of tongs so to avoid putting your hand in the disposal . <p> Step 2 Locate the Garbage Disposal and begin removing the drain line . ( ours was held in with screws but yours may vary ) <p> Step 3 Remove the drain line from the disposal . ( you will have to loosen the other line that is attached to it to remove it ) <p> Step 4 Completely Remove the drain line from the disposal and look in the hole to see if there is an object causing the clog.

( ours was full of gunk therefore causing the clog ) <p> Step 7 Since your sink is apart , do not run water from your faucet or it will leak out . Use a garden hose and spray out the clogged food from inside of the " T " plumbing . <p> Step 8 Once you are sure that all the clogs are removed , put the plumbing lines back in their place and firmly tighten . Once everything is back together , run water from the sink faucet and run your disposal . There should be no leaks , no clogs and the disposer should work . <p> Wow best ever !

Much appreciated . <p> Tiffany , We would not recommend working on your garbage disposal without first unplugging it . Are you trying to remove it or unjam it ? Is it buzzing ? If there is something in the disposal that is preventing it from spinning , then you can use a wooden object to try and get it out to unjam it . -RR <p> I installed a new disposer . The previous one drained water from the sink fine . This one slowly fills the sink . I removed the knock out plug for my dishwasher and that works fine . The disposer grinds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and they are clear . I ran ice cubes down the disposer several times and that 's fine . But still , water fills . It drains in its own time . What could it be ? Everything is the same between the disposers except the brand . <p> Lisa , It is most likely the plumbing lines under the sink . If the tube that goes from the disposal has anything clogged in it , it will SLOW DRAIN . Be sure to take off all plumbing lines under the sink and clean them out elsewhere . Some of the tubing has very small hoes in them so nothing large can fall down the drain and be lost forever . Check and recheck if needed . -RR <p> Hey . this was a great explanation and I used it the first time mine was clogged . But the second time around I decided to give the plunger a whirl . ( I recommend buying a new one for obvious reasons ) Mine is a dual sink so myself and my wife plunged at the same time . ( or you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a charm . turned it on after 15 seconds of plunging and it cleaned it out . <p> I am not a " handy man " by any stretch of the imagination .

I keep thinking its something weird , like air is sneaking into the line and that 's causing some pressure issues that keep the line from draining . <p> Brandon , Try a BRAND NEW toilet plunger . If you have a double sink , cover the other side . Fill the disposal side with water , have someone look under the sink with a flashlight while you plunge the water down . You will usually see water come out of one of the pipes where the blockage is as pressure will make it leak . Where you see the leak is usually going to be where the blockage is . If you see no leak and the water goes down , then it is fixed . This is not very high tech but it seems you have tried all other methods . Give it a try and let us know the results . -RR <p> Just ran several cups of ice cubes through the disposal and it has started to drain properly again and not back up with dirty water .

I think my feeble attempts are useless . I live in an old , single level condo complex of 27 units , and my unit is nearest the street .

This looks like a job for a plumber with a power snake that likes climbing up on roof tops = Oh , and yes , I 've tried both hot water and a plunger as remediesto no avail . <p> I 'm stumped .

We have used concrete blocks , pieces of wood , 2+4s , rocks , and bricks to put near the bottom of the fence . This dog is super strong and can move just about anything . The dog can remove concrete cinder blocks , bricks , 2x4s , and rocks that we have placed along the bottom of the fence to try and prevent the constant digging . My yard is medium sized so a solution that is not very expensive would be nice . The soil here is dirt and clay material and super easy to dig through especially when it rains and the ground is wet . What is the best way or proven solutions to DOG PROOF my fence ? <p> HOW TO DOG PROOF YOUR FENCE <p> Here are 5 solutions that have been proven to work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 . Bury a 3 to 4 foot tall chicken wire fence about 1.5 to 2 feet deep . Bend it into an L shape so it touches the ground and the fence . Then dig 1 or 2 feet down near the bottom of the wood fence . Use a staple gun on the top 1 to 2 feet of the chicken wire and secure it to the wooden fence . Next , bury the other end of the chicken wire and cover it up with dirt . Add huge rocks to where the most digging happens . This may not be the best way but it does provide a " shield " so the dog can not dig through it . <p> 2 . Buy some railroad ties and line the entire bottom edge of the wood fence . If you want them to stay in place , stake them with rebar every 20 inches . This is back breaking work but it can solve the problem and your doggy will never leave your yard again . <p> 3 . Use a strong hot pepper powder . Use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spread it on the digging areas near the fence . Do this every two weeks and it is almost guaranteed your large or small puppy will never dig there again . <p> 4 . Rebar with bricks or concrete blocks can work well too . Hammer 3 to 4 foot pieces of rebar into the dirt a few inches from the bottom of the fence . Once the rebar is in place , put the large bricks or concrete blocks where the rebar goes right into the holes of the bricks . Once the bricks are in place use plastic caps on the ends of the rebar for safety . Cover the bricks with dirt if needed . If you do not want to use rebar ( since it may be difficult to cut many pieces ) you can use 4 foot long ( and thick ) wooden stakes . The wood stakes can be used but may not be a true permanent solution rather than using rebar . <p> 5 . Get an invisible fence . A good one to use is the Innotek Basic In-Ground Pet Fencing System @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . To test it make sure to turn the range all the way down . Then put the invisible fence collar on your dog . When your doggy gets close enough to the wire , your dog will start to figure out not to go near the fence again . These digging- deterrent systems do not hurt your dog , they simply make them slightly uncomfortable enough to deter them . Start with the setting on as low as possible . If needed then turn it up until it is enough of a deterrent to stop them . <p> An invisible fence for dogs creates a boundary perimeter around your yard . <p> NOTE : If you have a metal or chain link fence , put PVC tubing around every one of my metal fence posts . Elevate the chain link fence from the ground and hook an electric fence charger up to the entire chain link fence at the bottom only . <p> Here is a dog forum where you can read other peoples questions and answers for even more solutions for dog-proofing your fence and backyard . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fence <p> If you know of other methods to stop dogs from digging under fences , please leave a comment below to assist our other readers who 's dogs are trying to escape ! <p> We were just told that our soil is too rocky to dig down 18-24 ? to bury a wire fence ( &amp; attach to our 6 ' wooden privacy fence ) we wanted to install in order to adopt a 7 yo black lab/coonhound mix dog that 's a known digger .

If your air filter size is not available at your local Home Depot , Lowes , or ACE Hardware , then buy them online and save some money while doing so . <h> Best way to purchase &amp; save money on home furnace air filters <p> You can order a custom size ac air filter or a residential standard air filter online and get them for much less in a convenient 6 pack . Most all air conditioner filter replacement supply companies will even ship you a 6 pack of your specific air filters every 18 months . This is a handy way to always have the correct size and type on hand . You will also remember to change your air filter on a regular basis since they are being delivered to your home . <h> Choosing the correct air conditioner air filter size <p> Most air conditioning filters , furnace filters , and HVAC filters are the same exact thing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your filter as an " air filter " in the summer and as a " furnace filter " in the winter . A key thing to know about your air filter when ordering a replacement is the correct size . You will need to know the length , the width , and also the thickness ( depth ) when ordering a replacement . Most filters will have the dimensions printed on the side . If there are no sizes printed on your filter , measure your air filter with a tape measure to find the dimensions And if you were wondering , the numbers are interchangeable . Here is an example : 20 ? x 25 ? x 1 ? is the same as 25 ? x 20 ? x 1 ? . Common filter sizing is referred to like this : LxWxD or length x width x depth or height . When ordering filters online , make sure you are ordering the correct depth air filters . This is a common mistake as many people get the first 2 numbers correct ( length and width ) but forget or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <h> Choosing what type of AC or furnace air filter is best <p> Once you have the dimensions you will need to choose the level of air filtration by choosing what type of air filter suits you best . There are different types of air filters for different types of environments . Some filters are designed for maximum energy efficiency while others remove more particles from the air . If you have pets or smoke in your home , you should replace your air filter more often . You should also upgrade your filter to one that has a higher MERV rating for maximum air filtration . <h> Quality and effectiveness of ac air filters <p> In the air filter world , there are cheap air filters and there are expensive air filters . The effectiveness of an air filter is measured in MERV ratings ( Minimum Efficiency Reporting Value ) . This rating system breaks the filters down into specific categories . The higher the MERV number or category , the better the air filtration . Filtration performance is determined by the size and density of the material @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the air particles that are being filtered . The more dense the filter is , the more difficult it is for the air to pass through . This can result in higher energy usage and reduces efficiency . A less dense cheaper air filter will let the air flow through more efficiently but will not catch as many particles in the air . Those are a few of the differences in the types of filters available today . Your air filtration choice should depend on your current living situation such as if you have pets , you smoke , or you have allergies . <h> Home air filters and the air quality inside your house <p> The air pollution in your home is among the top 5 environmental health risks . You can make the air quality in your home exceptionally better by simply changing or upgrading your air filter .

Change your AC filters every 30 days is best for optimal performance of your air conditioner . For a furnace it is recommended to change the filter out every 4 or 6 weeks in the winter time . What happens if my air filter is clogged ? A clogged air filter will block the needed airflow and make it impossible for the AC to run efficiently . When the air that flows through the filter is obstructed , that air can slip around and behind the filter bringing in all kinds of dirt and dust to the evaporator coil . When this happens the heat absorbing capacity of the coil is reduced significantly . By removing and replacing a dusty obstructed air filter with a new one , you will reduce the amount of energy it takes to run your AC by 4% to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I need an air filter that is thicker than 1 inch ?

And in the wall near the air handler , where the current inlets are located , to install framing to add filters at that location . <p> I just moved from a home where I purchased my air filters from Ace Hardware , all of the homes in the area were built by the same builder , thus all had the same AC unit needing the same size air filter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for around $5.00 , but as soon as they were delivered , they sold out .

What say you , the experts ? <p> Cindy Roberts , If the AC filter is 10x20x1 , then using ultra cheap filters that are the wrong size and doubling them up is not efficient .

Plumbers tape is a Teflon tape that adds an extra " no leak " protection to the threads so the water will not leak out . <p> Plumbers putty is just a simple putty that is like clay . It goes on certain areas to create a water barrier . It is used under the deck plate of a 1 hole kitchen faucet so water does not leak down into the cabinet area . <p> So after you have decided you need to replace your kitchen faucet for whatever reason , you will need to purchase a kitchen faucet , possibly some basic tools , safety and lighting equipment etc . Your kitchen sink will usually be a 3 hole sink . Some are 4 hole which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a separate water sprayer or a soap dispenser . If you have a 3 hole sink then just about any kitchen faucet will work as a replacement as it will come with a hole cover plate ( deck plate ) to cover the 2 holes next to your 1 hole faucet .

@@13196766 @1796766/ <h> How To Fix A Refrigerator Making High Pitched Noise <p> Refrigerators can be noisy ( clicking , buzzing , humming , high pitched squeaks ) and some sounds are just a normal process of refrigeration . Sometimes a refrigerator will develop a problem and a high pitched noise can be heard . To fix this issue you must determine the source of the sound . By doing so you can locate the problem and hopefully avoid calling an appliance repair company . <p> TO FIX THE NOISE COMING FROM YOUR REFRIGERATOR : You first have to do a little easy investigating . What type of noise it is that makes the refrigerator sound as if something is wrong ? Is it a squeaking noise , a clicking noise , a buzzing noise , a humming noise , a loud high pitch vibration noise , or an occasional rattling noise ? How loud is it and how long does the sound happen ? If it is not a continuous sound , how often does it occur ? Is this affecting the proper operation of your refrigerator or is it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ identify the source of the problem to help you to determine what you need to do to fix it . <p> Open the fridge freezer and determine if the noise is coming from one or the other . If the noise is inside the refrigerator it is the circulating fan . This fans purpose is to move the cool air from the freezer to your refrigerator . This fan can start to make different types of noises over time . Usually the circulating fan will need to be replaced . In some situations you can take the fan out clean it off and bend or straighten the blades to make the noise stop . Usually the noise is from the motor of the fan which is not fixable . Order a new circulating fan online will be inexpensive for you to repair the problem with your fridge . <p> If the noise is coming from the rear or back of the refrigerator , 2 things can cause the noise : <p> Compressor : The compressor contains a motor that sits in a sealed case . If it becomes faulty it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ causing the noise , the compressor needs to be replaced and this can be expensive . It may make more sense to just buy a new refrigerator if your compressor is shot . <p> Condenser Fan : If you find that the condenser fan is making the noise you can clean it off from dirt and lint . A dirty condenser fan can cause the noise you are constantly hearing . It is located near the compressor and ca n't be missed if you are behind your refrigerator looking for it . You can also give the fan a few drops of oil as it may just need oil to lubricate it to stop the noise . <p> Another area that could be making a noise on your fridge is the very bottom . A drain pan is the only thing underneath the fridge but it may need to be repositioned as it could be vibrating and causing a noise . <p> My new Whirlpool fridge started to make a high pitched sound shortly after the compressor started . Problem is from one of the 1/4 ? copper tubes which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refrigeration gas into the compressor . I was acting as a tuning fork . You could control the on/off of the noise by holding the piping . Solution for me was some Styrofoam with a 1/4 ? hole drilled in and some duct tape around the base of the piping to take away with vibration . Noise stopped . <p> I 've got a loud clicking noise on my Samsung American fridge freezer which happens when I 'm opening and shutting the fridge this can last a long time after its been open and shut what is it and is it costing me a lot of money in electricity . <p> i have a GE fridge and freezer .. it makes a shrieking high pittched noise for hours at a time from the bottom of it.it echoes in my whole house <p> i am renting so i called the owner who called the service and they replaced a fan in the freezer but it is not where the noise comes from .. reading here iot seems it could be the drain pan .. how do i get to it and clean it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just bought a Kenmore Elite bottom freezer refrigerator . Its making high pitch noise . Not too loud but enough to drive me crazy . The first 24 hours were the loudest and now its more subtle , but i can still hear it . Should i return the refrigerator ? I am in a dilemma here because i am sensitive to high pitched sounds and i am afraid that it will also be the case with the next refrigerator . Any recommendation for a refrigerator that do not have this problem ? ( For a maximum 30 ? wide fridge ) . I like this new fridge , but worried about the noise . <p> I 'm in the EXACT same situation as you . But mine is a Samsung refrigerator . I 've called Samsung and waiting to hear back from them about setting up a repair time . I kind of expect the technician to say " oh , that 's normal . " But I 'll push for them to open it up and at least grease some fans or something . <p> Either way , I 'd say we had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same high pitch noise so returning for a different brand may not help . Call Kenmore and have them come look at it . <p> My fridge makes an extremely loud hum , like a generator or AC unit , whenever it is cooling the contents . In other words , not all the time , but just when it kicks in to cool . Sometimes there is a high pitched sound as well as the hum . It sounds so awful that when it kicks off you feel incredibly relieved . Is there any chance it is something cheap to fix like the fan or is it likely the compressor ? Thanks ! <p> I have a new fridgidaire french door fridge with the freezer below . Since about 3 weeks in it has been making a nearly constant high pitched whirring sound , i think its coming from somewhere down behind the freezer .

Plus so high pitch that I can hear it but Maintenance guy can barely hear it so does n't  want to replace it . <p> We have a Maytag side by side Dual Cool refrigerator , and it was not keeping the freezer items frozen so when I read online it said the main culprit may have been the dust or pet for build up on the coils . There was some frost on the back of the freezer halfway up also . I removed the frost and I cleaned all the coils , front and back- I plugged it in and it still was not working .

It is coming from the fridge not the freezer . Normal fridge and freezer operations still seem to be working though . <p> Monique , The buzzing noise you are hearing is most likely a noisy capacitor , relay , compressor , or something may simply be loose . Unplug the machine and check to be sure all parts are secure . If a part becomes loose it may buzz . Usually a buzzing noise on any type of refrigeration is a cap or relay .

What else can we look into ? <p> Nina , Where is the buzzing sound coming from on your Whirlpool refrigerator ? It may be one of the fans .

The compressor may be going bad or possibly the fan is making the high pitched noise when the compressor is running . Can you not look at the back of the fridge when the high pitch noise occurs and find the part that is making the noise ? If it is the compressor , replace the mini fridge . If it is the fan , replace the fan as they are cheap and easy to install . -RR <p> I have just moved into a flat with a fully built in kitchen containing a snug fridge-freezer .

Its working fine otherwise but sounds like I have crickets loose in my house ! What could be causing this ? <p> Jamie , You most likely have a fan that is making the high pitch noise . Check the fan in the freezer section and the fan down near the compressor to be sure the fan blades are not hitting or making contact with anything and therefore causing the noise . You may also have a compressor that is making high pitched noises when it runs . Is the noise constant or intermittent ? -RR <p> We have a high pitch noise on a 2 year old KitchenAid refrigerator .

I cant track it down , but it seems to be originating from the fridge , not the freezer . Any suggestions ? <p> Roger , Does the high pitched sound only happen when the compressor is running ? Are the fans aligned correctly and not hitting the area surrounding them ? Make sure all parts are secure and TIGHT as something that may be loose could be causing your issue . -RR <p> Our fridge makes a high pitched noise , but only every so often .

Is the fridge working properly besides the noise ? -RR <p> I have the same issue with my LG French door freezer drawers beneath . Was the problem ever fixed ? LG repair just replaced the control board . Not sure if it is fixed because the noise stopped before they came to diagnose the problem . I have a feeling it will still make the noise .

Can you hear a relay near the compressor click ? Are the fans in the fridge/freezer running ? -RR <p> Lori , There is a fan in the back portion of the freezer . When it is spinning , it is most likely hitting the housing and making the sound . You will have to unplug the refrigerator , take the panel off inside the freezer and check the fan . You can possibly bend the blades so it stops hitting , or it may need to be readjusted or replaced . -RR

How much time have you given it after plugging it in to see if the compressor begins to run ? If the compressor NEVER runs , and EVERYTHING else runs ( lights , fans ) then you may have a start cap or relay issue that is preventing the compressor from starting .

If you are trying to figure out which direction you are standing without using any type of watch or mobile device , there is a simple way to accomplish this . There are 3 simple and easy ways to figure out which direction you are standing <p> 3 Easy Ways To Find Out What Direction You Are Standing <p> Method 1 . Stand with your right arm pointing to where the sun rises in the morning ( East ) . Your shadow will face behind you when using this method . With your right arm facing East , you will then be facing North and be able to quickly know what direction North , South , East , and West is . <p> Method 2 . If you are near a Highway or State road , the number of the road will tell you what direction you are going or facing . North to South Highways are numbered with ODD numbers . ( Highway numbers grow larger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) is an ODD number and therefore goes North to South direction . East to West Highways are numbered with EVEN numbers .

It cleans the dishes fine but the noise has me concerned . It seems to only make the grinding and vibrating noise when the wash cycle starts up and then every so often it will make the loud noise again . Can you tell me some DIY repair advice on what I can check myself ? Also , it is a Whirlpool brand dishwasher that is about 5 years old . It is in good condition and we run a wash cycle with the machine empty with vinegar every month . We are on a budget and can not call a repairman right now . Hope you can help ! <p> A dishwasher that makes a loud grinding noise is a very common issue . Whether the dishwasher is brand new or many years old , there are common reasons this will happen . An older dishwasher making noises can be a few different things . Normally , when a dishwasher makes strange loud noises , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that was being cleaned broke and fell into the bottom of the dishwasher . Many times the foreign object has lodged itself inside of the gears or pump of the dishwasher . <p> You can avoid calling a repairman by taking the dishwasher apart and try to find the object that is causing the loud grinding or vibrating noise . No matter what brand of dishwasher you may have ( Bosch , GE , Whirlpool , Frigidaire , KitchenAid , Maytag , Kenmore , and LG ) this is a standard method of taking apart almost any dishwasher . <p> Use this dishwasher disassemble schematic to guide you when taking your dishwasher apart . <p> The first thing you must do is look under the sink and find the power cord for the dishwasher and UNPLUG it from the outlet . Then remove the top and bottom racks ( assuming it is not filled with dishes ) to make it easy to access the bottom of the dishwasher . Next , you will need to remove the lower spray arm assembly at the bottom of the washer . This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place . The screw may be a reverse thread screw , so you may need to turn it clockwise instead of counter clockwise . If you are unable to remove it Google " How to remove the lower spray arm on my model X dishwasher " . Once you have that removed , take a look in the bottom to see if there may be anything that could be causing the noise . If not , continue removing the parts underneath to get to the very bottom of the dishwasher . <p> This is the lower spray arm of the dishwasher that needs to be removed first . <p> The next piece you will need to remove is the dishwasher screen . The dishwasher screen is located right underneath the lower spray arm . To remove this you may need a set of Torx screwdrivers as it may have torx screws holding in place . Once removed check that there are no visible debris that could be causing the noise . This is a good time to clean the screen/filter with soap and water to remove any food grease and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ top of this that may need to be removed . This will depend on your specific dishwasher brand . If you still have not found any debris that may have been causing the noise , continue removing in the next step below . <p> The part under the spray arm is the screen or filter which needs to also be removed . <p> Next ( depending on your dishwasher brand ) you will need to remove the pump housing cap . This is a plastic piece that covers all the other things inside the dishwasher . The pump housing covers things such as the food disposer blade that will sometimes have big chunks of food or debris in it . This is a common cause for a noisy dishwasher . The pump housing will usually have 2 screws in it that need to be removed . Once you have this removed , check and make sure you see no debris that may be the root cause of the noise . If there are debris such as food and pieces of plates , cups , etc , remove the objects and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then continue to remove items by reading more below . <p> Once parts are removed , you will be at the bottom of the dishwasher where most debris go . Clean everything out thoroughly and put everything back together and test the dishwasher . <p> The next would be the upper impeller . This is normally held in place by a bolt or screw . Remove this and the food grinder plate should be visible . This is pretty much the bottom of the dishwasher . If you find broken pieces of plates , cups , toothpicks , food , screws , washers , etc then this is most likely the cause of the noise . Remove all the foreign objects and put the dishwasher back together reversing the way you took it apart . <p> The above is the most common reason for a noisy dishwasher . Here are a few other parts of your dishwasher that could go bad to cause a loud noise <p> Wash Impeller The motor spins the wash impeller pushing water through the dishwasher spray arm(s) .

I could not figure out how to disassemble any further to get the rest of the debris . <p> Edgar , Check inside your GE dishwasher to be sure there is nothing down in the sump/drain area that may be causing the noise .

The repair required was discovered when I removed the kick plate and kept checking for leakage through each cycle . During the wash cycle there was none . During the sanitize process I observed steam coming out from under the front of the machine . A puddle formed and ran out onto the floor . With further inspection of the inside panel of the door I found there to be a bend at the bottom . This slight bend caused the rubber flap to not seal in steam . The damage to the inside door probably occurred when closing the door and the dish washing soap brick was under that part of the door . <p> Our Whirlpool dishwasher is just over a year old , and coming into the new year has started making a loud , vibrating sound multiple times throughout the cycle .

Just removed and replaced the lower spray arm , rinsed out the exposed food trap ( which I 'd already done ) and left saying it looked fine . I know this is n't fine , and I 'm at my wits end with it . Is this something that would be addressed by the above DIY or maybe a problem outside of the dishwasher ? <p> Amanda , If the repairman replaced the spray arm and the noise is still happening 3 or 4 times per cycle , you could have a bad pump , water inlet valve , motor , or something may be down in the sump causing a rattling vibrating noise when it drains .

Can you give us the model number of your dishwasher ? -RR <p> BN , If you have a noisy LG dishwasher and it is not cleaning your dishes very well , remove the bottom rack and look down inside the " sump " pump area where the water drains . You will probably find pieces of food and possible broken dishes and glasses that may be clogging the dishwasher and creating the noise you hear .

You may also have the hose or water line that brings water to the Bosch dishwasher hitting the sides of the cabinet and causing the noise . Check the water line when it is pulling water . If that is not it , replace the water inlet valve . -RR <p> Thanks very much for this video .

Check down near the sump and be sure there is nothing there that can be causing the noise . If the noise occurs when the water is being supplied to the dishwasher , it may that the water inlet valve is receiving erratic power causing it to open and close rapidly . OR .. Possibly the spray arm is not aligned properly and therefore hitting an area of the dishwasher . Have you looked at the sides and top and bottom of the dishwasher to be sure there is nothing rubbing or hitting it ?

Are the dishes completely clean even when the noise happens ? Is the noise coming from the top , bottom , or side of the dishwasher ? Is the sound repetitive like something bumping the side or spray arms when the dishwasher is running ? Or is it a one time noise ? Does the noise happen on a certain cycle ?

Thanks again and keep up the great work ! <p> Jose , Pull out the bottom rack . Look into the bottom of the dishwasher to see if there is anything that may have fallen down into the dishwasher . You may need to take the bottom spin arm off to get to the bottom . Most likely something is down inside where the spray arm turns and causes the noise . -RR <p> Our Amana dishwasher is making a loud , high-pitched squealing noise throughout the wash ( plus periodic clicking/buzzy sounds like its moving through a cycle ) .

Nothings visible in the bottom grinder area , the arms all look right , and everythings coming out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and seems to be getting louder . Diagnosis ? <p> Hi C Amorese , It sounds as if there may be a seed , bone , or chunk of glass stuck in the pump motor . Take the machine apart and check to be sure that nothing is stuck in the pump making the sound . If it seems the noise is coming from the front panel , it may be that the vibrations are moving up through the machine making it seem that the noise is coming from the front . -RR

Your refrigerator lights are on , you can hear the fan blowing air in the refrigerator , but the air is not cold . If this is your situation , then the repair is probably going to be a reasonably easy DIY job . When your refrigerator has working lights , the inner fan ( or blower ) inside the fridge is still blowing and the air is room temperature , then possibly the problem is the Compressor Start Relay . The start relay is a small device mounted to the side of the compressor . It provides power to the winding for a split second at start up to help the compressor run . The other component that may have failed could be the Start Capacitor . The start capacitor acts almost like a battery to give the compressor a small boost during power up . <p> The purpose of this guide is to give you some options to check yourself . The parts explained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is worth looking into before calling a repairman . If you are not comfortable with removing and replacing parts on your refrigerator , then call a repairman . <p> The relay and the capacitor are what help start the compressor . The compressor is what produces the cold air to cool your refrigerator . If one of these two parts are faulty , then the compressor will not run and therefore there can be no cold air . The refrigerator can be on but if the compressor is not running the air will not be cold inside your refrigerator . This is a very common reason why most refrigerators stop cooling but keep blowing air . <p> If you hear a clicking sound coming from the back of the fridge , then the compressor start relay is most likely working properly and is not the issue . If this is the case then the next most likely part that has gone bad is the start capacitor . These 2 parts are cheap and can be found at appliance stores and home improvement stores , even local smaller hardware stores should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be found online and at extremely reasonable prices . <p> How to replace relay and or capacitor on a refrigerator <p> We recommend unplugging the refrigerator from power and sliding it out from the wall . Remove the panel on the back bottom of the fridge and visually inspect the start relay and capacitor for signs of damage . You may find signs of melting or burned areas . These parts will be on the side of the compressor . Test the start capacitor first with a capacitance meter and the start relay . If one of these parts is burned , melted , etc , and you do n't  have a meter , then you can either call a repairman , go buy a multimeter , order the part online , or remove the part and take the part with you to an appliance store and match it up with the same part . <p> How to install a universal relay on your refrigerator compressor <p> There can be other issues why your refrigerator is not blowing cold air such as a bad compressor , bad temperature control thermostat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ board may be defective .

Changed the evaporate fan motor . Fridge now blowing air inside but not cold at all . Researched , found most probable issue now is comp relay . Switched it out , still same issue . Was told could be the other part that attaches to comp , called the overload or the start capacitor but they were not in stock so I did not purchase . I hear compressor running ( and I did this whole time ) so to me now it sounds like all the freon leaked out ? Or possibly a comp that runs but is broken in some other way . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the condenser fan and start relay on the compressor and you still have same issue of NO COLD AIR You may have a bad compressor . If you can hear the compressor running and you are sure it is running , then you could have a board issue or a wiring issue somewhere in the fridge . Most likely the r134 refrigerant did not leak out . The compressor may be faulty or a board or wiring issue is preventing it from cooling . Can you give us the model number of your GE fridge ? -RR <p> I have a Maytag MFF2558KEW French door type fridge , neither compartment is getting cold , both fans are working , everything is clean , settings are at #5 compressor is hot to touch and every so often I hear a click . What readings should I have on the start relay or capacitor and can this be the problem all happened overnight ? <p> Dan , Most likely the main control board is bad . If your compressor is working , the cap/relay is working , the fans are working , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could try a manual defrost and see if that resets anything . The part you will probably end up replacing is here . Maytag Refrigerator Main Control Board W10503278 -RR <p> I have an LG refrigerator . The refrigerator part is not cooling . The freezer is ok . I unplugged it then after a few hours plug it again . Ref and freezer are working fine . But after a few days the ref becomes warm and not cooling again . What seems to be the problem ? I also notice this happens whenever I add items ( ice cream or make ice ) on the freezer . Freezer working fine but the ref will start not cooling even if I hear the compressor is working . <p> Melani , You may have a fan issue in the freezer . Does the freezer make any type of unusual noise every now and then ? If you have too many items in the freezer blocking the back , it will reduce the amount of cold air that flows into the refrigerator . Do not pack too many items towards the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fridge section temp dial is set correctly . -RR <p> I own an American Fridge that is almost new , works very well but recently stopped getting cold or freezing . The repair man who came first made me purchased a home used compressor and also replaced the capacitor but the problem is still unchanged , the second person tested the old compressor and claimed it is not bad but working properly . Decided to replace it with the new one , changed the starter as they call it and replaced the freon gas as well . Everything was working but within some few hours , the fridge went back to cool instead of cold and the fridge is almost new . What do i do please . <p> Wisdom , Is it a fridge/freezer and only the fridge compartment is not cold ? Or is it that both freezer and refrigerator are both not cool . Are the fans turning ? Do you hear the compressor turn on every now and then ? Is the air cool or room temp coming into the fridge ? What is make and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Galanz GL31BK mini fridge for our trailer to replace the old one . When we got it , we opened it and plugged it in . It worked fine . We unplugged it and moved into our trailer . Put it in its spot and plugged it in and it wont cool . The light goes on and you can hear the motor but that 's it . We had to tilt it a little to get it in its spot . Is there a reset or anything we can do ? We really do n't  want to take it back out . We have had it unplugged for over 6 hours now also . Any help would be great ! ! Thanks 
@@13196780 @1796780/ <h> Refrigerator Water Dispenser Not Working How To Fix <p> If your refrigerator water dispenser is dispensing either no or slow water , here is what to check to fix it . ( No or Slow Water from Dispenser ) If your refrigerator is newly installed , make sure you push the water dispenser lever down for 3 minutes to get the water reservoir to fill up completely . Usually the water reservoir is located inside the fresh food section . Top mount refrigerator models do not apply because there is no water reservoir . <p> On most refrigerator dispensers whether it be a Whirlpool refrigerator , Frigidaire refrigerator , Samsung refrigerator , KitchenAid refrigerator , Haier refrigerator , Jennair refrigerator , GE refrigerator , LG refrigerator , Kenmore Elite refrigerator , or Maytag refrigerator , it should take on average 8 seconds to fill an 8 ounce glass of water . <p> If your refrigerator has no lights on the control panel and no water or ice , check power to the refrigerator . <p> If all of a sudden your fridge is not dispensing water : Be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refrigerator is turned on or open . Usually a saddle valve or similar will be used to connect the fridge water supply line to your home water supply . This valve needs to be completely open so the refrigerator receives water . You should also check the water inlet valve on the back of your fridge . This is electrically operated and can be tested with a volt meter to see if it is working properly . Also be sure that the water line behind the refrigerator is not kinked or bent . If you recently pulled the fridge out , you may have bent the water supply line when you pushed the fridge back in place . It is also possible that a water line has become frozen inside the fridge and that is why the water flow is restricted . Check all water lines for ice and or restricted sections . <p> You may also have a clogged water filter . This filter is either built into your refrigerator or it is " inline " of the water line behind your refrigerator . A clogged water filter will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the dispenser . Change the water filter and this will most likely solve your issue . Refrigerator water filters need to be changed every 6 months . Once you have replaced the water filter , test the dispenser . If the water flows as it should , then you have fixed the problem . <p> If the water dispenser is not working , but you know it is being supplied with water and has power , then a defective switch in the dispenser is most likely to blame . You may need to take the dispenser apart and troubleshoot the valve and or switches in the dispenser . You may hear a clicking noise or a humming noise if a switch or valve is defective . <p> If the water dispenser drips water constantly then you have a water valve problem . You can look up your refrigerator model online and find the switch or valve that you need to replace and DIY . <p> If there is a slight dribble of a few drops of water after using the dispenser , this is normal and due to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the dispenser is a big problem , you can purge the complete water tank and water line system . Use a large cup and press down on the dispenser for 3 minutes . This will remove trapped air that can cause the water dispenser dribble . You should also empty the recess grill ( water catch ) and clean out underneath it to prevent water dripping out and making a puddle on the floor . <p> Common refrigerator water &amp; ice dispenser parts breakdown <p> NOTE : The water and ice dispenser in the door will not work if the refrigerator door is open . <p> Remember , when troubleshooting a water no flow issue with your refrigerator , disconnect power and turn off the water supply for safety reasons . <p> If you know of other reasons a refrigerator stops dispensing water or ice , please leave a comment below to assist our other readers . <p> I have a GE Profile Performance side by side refrigerator that suddenly stopped dispensing water .

Still nothing . Any ideas on how to troubleshoot this ? <p> I have a Maytag Model : MFD2561HES 25 Cu . Ft . French Door Bottom-Freezer Refrigerator when I replace the old filter to a new one there was no water coming at all . Purchased several filters same issue no water coming . I do not think the Water inlet Valve is bad , cause with the old one still working its slow but working . I 'm sure I got the correct filters I have this refrigerator for many years . <p> I have a Samsung RF4287HARS French Door refrigerator . All was working fine till we replaced the filter .

All three of the new filters ( including the Samsung filter ) do look slightly different than the old one we took out . Water inlet valve ? Water filter housing ? Air in the water line ? Maybe something else completely ? <p> Steve in NC , Try putting the old water filter back in and see what happens . If it works fine then you need the exact water filter replacement . If not then you may have an issue with water hammer and need to fix the issue . This article may assist you from what you have described as your issue . -RR <p> My Frigidaire ice maker water dispenser pours water out of dispenser when the ice maker calls for water . It will also pour water into the ice maker when ice water actuator is pressed . What can be causing this ? <p> Recently we lost power due to a storm .

I feel pretty confident that I have water coming in ( the ice maker is filling up with water ) . There does n't  appear to be a water hose kink . I 'm stumped . Any ideas ? <p> My water dispenser has stopped . I did decrease the temp due to all the food in the fridge from thanksgiving . I think the line might be frozen . How can I check for sure ?

Recently , I got the message to replace again . Then I had no water . I replaced the filter yesterday and today I still have no water . Everything worked fine a week ago . <p> We have a french door Maytag with freezer on the bottom and an indoor water and ice dispenser . The water dispenser is still working fine , but after running out of ice last night , the ice maker is no longer making ice . Clearly there is still water coming into the fridge , as we are getting chilled water out of the dispenser . Any thoughts ? Yes , the ice maker is turned on . <p> I have a GE Profile Arctica . Today I changed the water filter as I have done many times before , running 3 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out the carbon filings , etc . Flow was fine . No problem . <p> Then a few hours later I go down to get a glass of water from the dispenser , and when I press the cradle no water comes out . I can HEAR water flowing , but it does n't  come out of the dispenser . Then I look down and notice that water is flowing on the floor from under the refrigerator ! <p> The ice maker seems to be receiving water just fine , the lights on the dispenser work as usual . I pulled out the fridge and inspected the back and everything seems fine back there . The water lines are obviously not kinked if water is flowing . I looked inside the fridge for a frozen or cracked reservoir , but its dry in there . I have no idea why the dispenser decided that the floor was the place to put the water , but there it is . <p> I have a LSC26905TT LG side-by-side fridge . The water &amp; Ice will not dispense . The ice maker is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Also the bulb next to the dispenser on the outside of the fridge will not illuminate despite replacing the bulb with a new one . Each of the settings options available on the door indicates that it changes . i.e. increase/decrease temp in freezer/fridge side , turn light on or off . Inlet vale is fine ( replaced it anyway ) . Dispenser switch seems to be fine too . Does it mean main electronic board needs to be replaced ? Can main electronic board malfunction like that and still operate the fridge ? <p> I have this EXACT same problem , however mine is a Kenmore fridge . And the bulb is not a socket-type bulb it is on a small square . But the water and ice wont dispense and the light wont come on . Puzzled ! Please help . <p> I replaced dispense solenoid and repaired mother board that went out partially . The dispenser solenoid was shortening motherboard . You can check it with multimeter for resistance . Good part should read 40 oms or so , bad one no resistance , zero .. I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the one on the back of the fridge i think is the power supply board , or the ones that are inside of the cover of the waterice dispenser are display board or control board ? <p> We 've recently been without power for a few days due to a bad storm we discarded all food and did a thorough clean of the fridge . I just wanted to make sure its ok to continue using the current filter . We just changed it less than a month ago . <p> I have a Maytag which is in a house I just purchased . The water dispenses fine but there is a replace filter light on . When I replaced the filter the light stayed on . I looked up how to reset the light and it worked . However , as soon as the replace filter light went out , the water would n't dispense , and neither would the ice . The trick to resetting the replace filter light was to hold down the light and the lock button for the count of three . But that seems to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ replace filter light come back on , the water and ice started dispensing again . How do I get it to dispense and not show that replace filter light at the same time ? The filter it uses is a UKF8001 and the fridge is a 22 cu ft bottom freezer . <p> Kenmore Elite refrigerator wont dispense water unless both doors are open ( water dispenser is inside the refrigerator ) . I did notice one of the two bulbs inside the refrigerator is out . I switched the bulb places in hope that supplying the working bulb to the side where the water supply is would allow it to be dispensed . But it still does n't  work . Ill be replacing the bulb with a new one since it needs to be done , hopefully thatll fix it . <p> I have a Frigidaire side by side . The unit continues to stop making ice and water . I can replace the filter and it will work for several months but there still is not much water pressure on the water dispenser . When we built our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home and I believe a line may be clogged on the unit . Any ideas on how to DIY ? <p> Neal Long , If the water pressure to your refrigerator is too low , the refrigerator water dispenser will sometimes not work properly . If you believe your complete water system in your home or just the water supply to the fridge is too low you should put a water pressure gauge on the water line and see if that is the cause of the issue before attempting to take the refrigerator apart . <p> If water pressure is okay , and you suspect there is a clog of some sort in your refrigerator water line visually inspect the water tubes . Check for pinches or cracks . A blockage could be a piece of clear ice . A clog other than ice should be removed by a professional refrigerator technician as you may have to remove and or pressurize the water lines to fix the problem . -RR <p> We are having similar problem . Just a slow trickle comes out and just changed filter about 1 mo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in back of frig and discovered it was brown , instead of clear . We have heavy iron and minerals in our water , even though we have a water filter on house . I am suspecting iron buildup is clotting water line . <p> We have a whirlpool side by side wrs325fdam02 . Our predicament is fun stuff . The filter works just fine , produces ice and water , but only if there is pressure put on the bottom area where the filter is actually inserted . For a while we had a peice of cork taped to the inside door of where you place the filter , so it would push on the filter for us , but this only works for a few days at a time . Help would be great . Thanks ! ! <p> RHope , Is the water filer housing gasket missing ? If so it will leak as it is not water tight . <p> Also , this happens on many different refrigerators if you are buying the cheaper NON-OEM water filters . Be sure you buy the Whirlpool brand water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issues . Try using a different filter and be sure the water filter housing is clean and free of debris so the filter does not leak or cause problems . -RR <p> We have a GE Profile PSS26MSRA side by side fridge and the water/ice dispenser stopped working . The green light over the water button will go out when the dispenser lever is pressed and no water comes out . The light will not work either . It stopped working all of a sudden , then a few minutes later worked fine ( dispensing water ) and then it stopped working again and has n't  worked since . Any idea what could be the issue ? We are thinking a sensor or something electrical , as the water line is fine . <p> Kirsten , It sounds like a board issue , or a wire harness is damaged or shorted out . You may need to take the from panel apart and visually examine the components for a burnt board , loose wire , damaged wire , bad micro switch , etc .. -RR <p> Donald Jerkins , Are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Samsung refrigerator ? Have you recently replaced any parts on your fridge ? Changed out the water filter ? You can try resetting the ice maker and that MAY solve your issue Samsung French Door Ice Maker Reset Let us know what you find . -RR <p> Becky , If you just replaced the water inlet valve on your refrigerator and no water is dispensing , check that the water valve that supplies the fridge is ON . Be sure the wire harnesses are securely attached to the water inlet valve . You may also have a faulty brand new valve Can you tell us the model number of your fridge and what the part number is that you replaced ? -RR <p> Sue , What model number is your fridge and where exactly is the water coming out ? How much water ? Is it dripping from the dispenser itself ? Try and remove the water filter and reinstall . You may have a pressure issue in the water lines . Possibly the valve that dispenses water is faulty . If the issue continues , call the company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by side fridges water dispenser is dispensing ice cubes instead of water when we press the water button . Earlier it did sound like ice was dispensing from the ice maker but it still dispensed the water when we pressed the water button but now its quit dispensing the water completely . Any idea what the problem is ? <p> Din , You may have a control board issue in the dispenser , a loose wire harness , or an issue with the valves . We would suggest to remove the front panel and check the components behind or in the dispenser . Remember to unplug the fridge when you do this . If you have to pull the fridge out to do any repairs , be careful of the water line so you do not pull it out of the wall if it is not long enough . -RR <p> Thanks for the reply ! For some reason , it magically fixed itself today . Ill wait to see if its an issue again in the future and do as you say . I tried googling it and some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but it was n't for this specific issue and I 've no idea what either of them actually do , although I suspect the solenoid assembly replacement might be for the door flap either not closing or opening properly and that was n't my issue . <p> I live in south Florida where there is a lot of calcium in the water , both city and well water . My water was dispensing very slowly then not at all . My ice maker was still making small amounts of very small cubes . I changed the filter twice , no help . I finally disconnected the water supply to the fridge at the wall valve . There was a small calcium deposit right in the connection point that was about 98% blocking the water to the fridge . I soaked it in vinegar for 30 minutes , then used a small pick file to remove the deposit . I reconnected the supply , and the water dispensed out of the door like it was brand new ! It took 2 wrenches , a flashlight , a small pick file and about 2 hours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cleanup . I hope this helps others . <p> Hello I have a maytag gold bottom freezer with 2 doors on top ice and water in the door , the ice maker is working fine . The water is making a bad humming noise and the water is barely flowing out . I have replaced the water filter and it is still happening . Thanks for any help <p> GE profile 9 years old . Water dispenser stopped working except late at night , then stops in the morning . Has done this on 3 nights in a row . Seems that when the refrigerator is not opened for a while the water dispenser works but when the refrigerator is entered in the morning the water dispenser stops . Late at night the flow is very good and I have let it flow upwards of a gallon ! ! ! What can be the problem please ? ? <p> Ralph Chan , If the water dispenser works only at certain times ( such as at night but not when opened frequently ) this may be because of a timer issue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a bad door switch that stops the water from dispensing when the door is sensed to be open . Use a meter and test a few of the parts to be sure they are operating properly . -RR <p> Ralph , This sounds like you have a frozen dispenser water line . Due to the age of the fridge , the insulation inside the freezer door starts to break down and no longer keeps the inside of the door above freezing unfortunately , right where the water line runs for the dispenser . You can confirm this by trying to insert a zip tie ( 8-10 ? long ) fully in to the water dispenser line ( where the water normally comes out ) . You should be able to fully insert the zip tie . If you 're not able to do so you have confirmed that you have ice blocking the water from flowing freely . <p> Jack , You either have a bad display board , a wire harness is disconnected or other . Have you made sure the panel is secure and attached electrically ? Usually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ check to be sure before you order a new one . ( Unplug the fridge when you check ) -RR <p> I have the KitchenAid refrigerator with the same issue , the dispenser panel has no lights on LED or any buttons , etc . I opened and checked the main 3 wires power input behind the dispenser board , they have 48/49 VAC , not sure if that is expected voltage or not . I troubleshoot the switch between door and internal light , it has continuity , I even swapped the wires and still see nothing . I checked all connectors are good so I am not sure what else to look for . <p> We have a Bosch B20CS50SNS . The water dispenser which was working fine stopped working after I cleaned the water dispensing area . When I press against water dispenser switch , it makes a noise as if the water is flowing in but no water comes out . We recently replaced the filter . Any idea on what 's stopping the water from dispensing ? <p> We have a few years old GE side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house . Our problem is that filters never seem to last a long time before the water pressure drops to a trickle . As soon as you put in a new one , it works great , but only for awhile . Weve tried different brands , but same problem . The longest we 've gotten out of a filter was 4 months and as short as 2 weeks . The change filter light never even goes on . This becoming an expensive problem . Help ! <p> I have Samsung RFG298HDRS that keeps getting air blockages in the water line . It started about 6 months ago when I changed the filter and the water flow would become very slow and/or completely stop with some hammering . I have tried multiple OEM filters ( 3-4 ) and sometimes the water dispenser will work for a few months ( or sometimes days ) and then the problem reoccurs or in my current case I just installed a brand new OEM filter and the best it will run for is a few seconds . Removing the filter and running the water for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the line ) does not help at all . With the filter removed , water pressure is fine . Both ice makers are also working fine . Could it be a seal associated with the water filter attachment that is broken allowing air in or something else ? Thanks <p> Moved into a new house with a brand new GE side by side refrigerator . Refrigerator worked perfectly dispensing water and ice . Lost power to the house for 6 days and now the new fridge dispenses no ice or water and also does not make ice either . Could the power outage have done something to the filter ? <p> Sonja , Is the fridge cooling ? It may have gone into demo mode . When you press the dispenser to get water or ice , do you hear the motor running to try and dispense ? Is the ice maker and the water dispenser getting water ? The water is turned on and supplying the fridge , right ? What is the model number of your GE fridge ? There may be a simple way to get the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ using the control panel and holding and pressing 2 of the buttons for 5 to 8 seconds . Have you tried removing the filter and inserting the bypass plug that came with your fridge ? -RR <p> Thanks for those comments . I tried holding down the dispenser switch for 2 minutes . Its humming away , like it tries to put water through but not a drop comes into the filter . <p> I do n't  see a Lock or Lock Controls button on the control panel . <p> If I hear the dispenser hum , does that mean the switches are working and harness is secure ? <p> This problem only started when we switched filters . This model tells you to switch filters by stopping the water flow somehow . Normally you put in a new filter and the water flows normally right away . Not this time . <p> My dispenser stopped working , so I put in a new filter and still no water comes out . No water goes to the filter . <p> Have replaced several filters in the past with no problem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pressing the reset button for 3 seconds . That got the Reset light blinking , then it went out as its supposed to do . Also pressed the door light switch 5 times in 10 seconds . <p> Also , tried a second new filter . No difference . Also tried putting the old one back in . No water . <p> Also shut off house water and turned back on . Also , unplugged fridge and re-connected . <p> Still no water going into the filter . It was working 2 days ago . When it stopped working we assumed it just needed a new filter . <p> Anything else you can suggest aside from pulling it out and disconnecting the water supply ? That is very tricky because of the way it is installed in an enclosure . <p> We have a GE Profile side-by-side , model PSCS3RGXSS . When running gallon 4 after changing the filter , the water suddenly stopped dispensing . When the dispenser lever is pressed , it no longer makes the humming noise it used to when dispensing water . <p> Some troubleshooting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the water line connection ( in the basement ) was open all the way ( turned all the way counter-clockwise ) . Closed and re-opened it ( in case sediment was in the way at this connection ) . Verified that the line to the refrigerator is not kinked . The ice-maker is still working . Ice cubes are of the expected size . We have the water filter bypass plug in , but still no water at the dispenser . When we disconnected the connection under the freezer door , no water comes out of the line when the dispenser lever is pushed . ( We thought wed be lucky and have a frozen line in the freezer like most other posters , but no such luck water is not getting this far ) . When we remove the bypass plug , there is an audible pressure release , and some residual water in the plug and that connection area . It seems that the water is getting to the filter/plug location . When we press the dispenser , there are 2 audible clicks one at the dispenser and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there used to be a mechanical , humming type sound when the lever was pressed that we are not hearing anymore . We could use some help with next steps . <p> We have a KitchenAid side by side with bottom freezer . All of a sudden , water and ice are n't  being dispensed . Connections under hinge in door look ok , water line is clear . Also , periodically , for no reason at all , the light and alarm telling us a door is open will go off when all doors are closed . Switch maybe , or bigger problem ? We just put $400 into this thing a few months ago because their faulty design was causing ice build up around the ice maker . Their stuff is junk &amp; I 'm so frustrated . <p> Yes that is correct . When I manually shut off the ice maker the water dispenser no longer randomly emits water . With the ice maker off the water dispenser will still emit water when the paddle is pushed . Kenmore Elite 25344383402 <p> Michael Devin , Are you saying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the water dispenser dispenses water at the same moment ? Please explain in detail and supply the model number of your refrigerator . -RR <p> Yes as close as I can tell they are at the same time . Its a little bit after the ice dumps that the water dispenser opens . Ca n't tell exactly without opening door which will stop ice maker . Its a Kenmore Elite 25344383402 <p> My water dispenser shoots out about 1-2 oz of water then stops . I have changed the filter by putting a brand new one in and it just shoots water out at a normal rate for about 2-3 seconds then slowly comes to a complete stop . What do you think is wrong ? <p> Jimmy Gillespie , You may have something clogged in the water line or there is a blockage at the filter housing . Check to be sure there is nothing that got jammed in the filter housing when you replaced the filter . Is there any type of knocking sound when you use the water dispenser ? Do you have the filter fitting that goes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bypass the water filter ? If so use that and see if the water dispenses as it should . Let us know what you find . -RR <p> I have a Kenmore Elite Model 25344383402 . The water dispenser on the door randomly runs for abort 5 seconds . I changed the filter and bled the system no change . It does n't  just drip , it runs like your filling a glass . <p> Well I thought I had it solved . There was a kink in the water feed line that was causing low pressure . Thought low pressure was upsetting the system . Ice maker working fine now but every time the ice maker calls for water the water dispenser in the door emits about a half cup . Something in the system is triggering the water micro-switch momentarily . Hope its not the motherboard . Help <p> U all may try this . There is also a switch close to the dispenser that sends the signal to the water pump . This switch is on a plastic base that if u have kids , like I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U can send for this base or do like I did place a couple of tie-raps to hold the switch in place . Hope this helps . <p> I have Kitchenaid Refrigerator ( bottom freezer ) that started making a loud chattering sound when dispensing water . Amount of water coming out is greatly reduced . A new filter fixed this once for a few months . 3 more filters have not . Different brands tried . It makes ice just fine , no chattering . I turned water supply valve to about 1/2 and it stopped chattering but water dispenses slowly . Still chatters 50% of the time now . Someone said the filter head needed replacing . I know ice makers use a restricting orifice to limit water fill amount . What is your idea , please ? <p> Roger , It may be possible that you have a mechanical failure inside the water valve . You may want to replace it or test it to see if that is causing your problem . Also , if the water filter is partially blocking the water flow the fluctuating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against the parts in the refrigerator causing the chattering sound . Something like this might be happening in your refrigerator . It is uncommon for a blockage to occur inside the water tubing . The water valve opens and let 's the water pressure of the house plumbing push the water through the tubing to the dispenser . A new or different brand of water filter might solve your problem . Try removing the water filter and with the filter removed the water should bypass the filter and flow at the normal pressure . Do some troubleshooting to see if it may be a combination of the water valve and the filter . -RR <p> I have a Kenmore Elite model 106.57799700 . I changed the filter as scheduled using an OEM filter . According to the directions , I began to drain 4 gallons of water , one gallon at a time . As I was draining the 4th gallon , water ceased to flow through the dispenser , but the volume counter on the dispenser display continued to count up . I stopped pressing on the control and tried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the refrigerator , and no water would flow . I heard no other sound . I tried again later that evening , and water began to flow . Even later that evening , I tried using the water dispenser , but no water would come out , and I kept hearing the clicking sound . The next morning , I tried again with no flow and the same click sound . Thinking the filter might be defective , I put the old filter back in , and tested immediately , but no water came out . I tried again 20 minutes later , and the water started flowing . I tested the dispenser repeatedly through the day , and water was flowing . That evening , I tried to fill a glass , and no water would come out . 30 minutes later , I tested again , and the water was flowing . Each time that water did not come out , the only sound I would hear was the click as I pressed on the dispenser control , and the volume counter would count up . Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Sounds like you have a pressure build up in the water lines . There may be gunk in the line somewhere . Shut the water off , remove the filter element , and blow air in the water dispenser . If that does n't  fix it then remove the line after the shut off , and blow air in it before the filter . This should fix the issue and water should flow from the dispenser as normal . If this does not help , let us know and we can go from there . -RR <p> Thank you , I will try this tonight , once I can figure out where the filter element is . I did notice a small amount of black gunk that came out when I removed the new filter . <p> I have noticed that , when I release the dispenser button from having received water , I hear a rattle , lasting 1-2 seconds , coming from the back of the refrigerator , where the water intake , valve and solenoid are located . Would that be consistent with your conclusion or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean you have a bad water inlet valve . Try what we suggested before and if that does not work , take a look at the valve and be sure the water lines are secure as sometimes when water if pumped into the water lines , the water lines will hit the side of the fridge in rapid succession and create that weird knocking and rattling noise . Get some plastic cable ties and secure the water lines to the frame of the fridge so the rattling stops . -RR <p> Bought a used Frigidaire Superba side by side , hooked up the water . Ice maker works fine , will not dispense water . Changed the filter but did n't  help . When I push the dispenser lever it makes a click but I do n't  hear the whirring sound . Where should I go from here ? <p> My Whirlpool side by side dispenses water but stops suddenly . Just click . Stop . If you push down again nothing happens . If u wait ten minutes and come back it will work again but only dispensed about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself off . We recently had quite a bit if ice in the freezer so maybe that affected somehow ? Can you tell me a few things to try or look for ? thanks . <p> Kristen , Check that the water filter is not clogged or install a new one . Some refrigerators use an electronic control to supply power to the water inlet valve . If you have verified that the water inlet valve is getting power and the actuator and switch are operating properly , then you may have a defective electronic control . If you have ice build up in the freezer , read here to find out more . -RR <p> I have a Samsung RFG297HDRS . The fridge no longer dispenses water or ice . I removed the cover at the top of the fridge and checked the door-open switch with a multi-meter and the switch is working fine . The ice maker still produces ice , because i use the ice for drinks and can hear it refill and there is fresh ice at the top the next day . So i am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few days ( sometime it would work ) but now it is completely dead . So i suspect it is the switch under the actuator on the door , but I cant find anything online on how to take the cover off to test this switch . Any ideas from you guys ? <p> I have a Whirlpool Gold Side by Side with the freezer draw on the bottom . The power went out last night and when we woke up the refrigerator was working but the ice/water dispenser will not light up or work . Periodically the light will come on flash then shut off <p> James , Can you give us the model number of your Whirlpool fridge ? If the power went out sometimes a fridge will display an error code telling you so Can you reset it using the control panel ? If not Remove the ice bin and check that the ice chute is clear of ice that may be stuck . Dump out the old ice and replace the ice bin . See if this may reset the fridge to get the display @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after about 3 months of using a new filter my water filter gets clogged up with water and slows the flow of water out of the dispenser . This is the 2nd filter i have replaced and it has happened twice so I cant blame the filter again . What causes the filter to get clogged with water and slow the water flow after 3 months ? I can remove the filter shake out the filter and it works normally for a few times and then gets clogged with water again . <p> Thank you . My water filter works fine after I replace it . The problem is it gets clogged with water after a few months and the flow of water slows down . The filter company has told me it is not normal for the filter to get clogged with water . Do you have any remedy for that ? <p> Richard , When you say your water filter is clogged with water The water filter is meant to filter the water that you drink or use for ice cubes , there will always be water in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the minerals are building up in the filter therefore causing the filter to clog ? -RR <p> There is no water getting to the valve . I removed the valve and still there is no water . The fridge is fine . Is there a chance that I have a clog in the water line ? Could I have an air lock in the line ? <p> Jerry , Which valve are you referring to ? The one in the back bottom of the refrigerator or the valve that is in the dispenser ? And yes there may be a clog in the water line itself . You can remove the lines and force air through it if you suspect a clog or replace the water lines with a refrigerator water supply kit . -RR <p> Jerry Spadafore , There may be a clog in the line if the water stopped flowing . Did you remove the valve or the filter ? If you remove the valve it most likely will not work . Have you made sure the valve that supplies water to the fridge is actually supplying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line crimped ? Is the ice maker or water dispenser turned on ? Is there a clog in the solenoid valve ? Have you tested the valve to be sure it is opening ? -RR <p> Kenmore side-by-side fridge . Pulled out water filter , water started shooting out . Once i got filter it , water in door and ice make stopped working altogether . Pulled the back off , inlet valve still makes humming noise when dispenser lever on door is pressed . Do n't  know what the FloodSafe valve looks like to try to " reset " it . I ordered a new inlet valve . Am I on the right track ? <p> I have a side by side Electrolux refrigerator . One lever on the dispenser controls both water and ice , my problem is no water comes out but the ice dispenses . Moved all ice from tray and its not making new ice . Could it be clogged water filter ? <p> Ray , Yes the water filter may be clogged and that is a simple fix so try that . If the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need to troubleshoot the ice maker and or dispenser to find why it does not dispense and or make ice . Be sure there are no crimps in the water line . Be sure the inlet valve solenoid is working properly to get water supply . What is the model number of your Electrolux fridge ? -RR <p> So I have an issue and I cant find anyone online who 's had the same . I have a Kenmore Elite French-door with freezer on the bottom . The lever for the water dispenser will not depress . It feels like its mechanically blocked or locked . It worked this morning before I went to work , but did n't  when I got home . Two recent things that could contribute . I recently moved this fridge from one house to another . Its worked for more than a week in the new location , so that seems unlikely . I did have maids clean the house today while I was at work . Could they have bumped something ? <p> Heres what I 've tried : Locked and unlocked the child lock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once for 5 minutes , another for 10 minutes Disconnected and reconnected the electrical connections near the door hinge Checked to ensure the little buttons that indicate the doors are properly shut twice ( though , when my doors are open , the lever will depress without dispensing water , so that 's not likely the issue ) . <p> Any ideas for me ? Seems likely that the maids just bumped somethingbut I 'm at a loss ! <p> Tara , If the lever is locked , it might be broken and therefore can not be depressed . You will have to take it apart and see what you can find . Once you identify the broken or loose part you can repair it or order a replacement part online . -RR <p> My ice maker works just fine , but water dispenser suddenly stopped working . It will make a humming noise , but no click and wont dispense even a drop . Filter was replaced 2 months ago so I know the filter is fine . I took the filter out and attached the bypass cap , and still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adjusted ( including the temperature for fridge and freezer ) . Any ideas ? <p> Les , Check to be sure everything is properly connected where the water goes into the dispenser . Test the motor/solenoid to be sure it is working properly . Make sure there are no water line crimps that may be causing the water to not flow . -RR <p> I changed the filter in my JennAir and now I cant get water to dispense . If I activate the water , it will come out for a second or so and then stop . No water will come out again unless I stop trying to get water for a few seconds and then try again . Then , again , I get about a second of water . I can hear the motor running but no water comes out . I tried the old filter and running it without the filter and I get the same results . I also tried the 5 seconds on/5 seconds off to flush out air and this did n't  work . Does this sound like a switch problem ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fridge stopped working right after you changed the filter , there may be a gasket or seal on the water filter housing that is not in place or off center . Try tightening the water filter too as sometimes the filter will not let the water dispense properly if the filter is not the exact tightness . Check to be sure there is nothing stuck in the water filter housing which could be blocking water flow . It is too much of a coincidence that the dispenser stopped working after filter change that a switch is the problem . -RR <p> I have a different spin on the issue with my fridge , GE GSL25JFXL LB . Ice works fine but no water . Its not a frozen line as I 've defrosted the whole unit completely and still no water . Replaced the board in the dispenser area , no water .. ohmed the solenoid valve in back right bottom and it ohms somewhere around 25 ohms so not open or short . Light works when you press for water but I 'm not hearing a click like the valve is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fine but no water out of the coupling at the bottom under the freezer door when pressing for water . I 'm thinking main board ? Great work to everyone here , best information I 've read yet . Any ideas . Thanks ! <p> Keith , If you have checked the solenoid valve and it is operating correctly , you replaced the board , and the water line is not frozen , the most likely issue is a microswitch in the water dispenser . Your GE fridge should have a microswitch that triggers the water flow when a cup or glass is depressed to it . Have you checked the switch and the wire harness connections within the dispenser ? If no water out of the coupling at bottom under the freezer door , have you disconnected it to check for a clog or blockage ? -RR <p> Thanks for the reply . I 'm not actually sure the solenoid is good as I only testing it ( wires disconnected ) at around 25 ohms ( not open or short ) which another post said was O.K. When considering the micro switch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was engaged ; it functioned correctly , unless it has multiple outputs ? . To be exact I only replaced the dispenser board not the main board in the back . The immediate problem is I do n't  hear the solenoid valve click on when I engage the water dispenser . <p> Keith , If the light comes on when the dispenser is depressed , it usually means the microswitch is in working order . Recheck solenoid , recheck connections Was the issue you were experiencing before the dispenser board change the exact same issue after you changed it ? -RR <p> I have an LG side by side fridge with a water and ice dispenser . I have a very slow water flow when dispensing water . At first I thought it might be the water filter so replaced that and still same slow flow . What else can I check ? <p> Rie , Have you checked to see if the filter or gasket may be off center when you put the filter on ? Is there a gasket or rubber seal on the filter assembly that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too loose it may not dispense water properly . Try tightening the water filter and see if that helps . Are you using an LG fridge water filter ? Sometimes aftermarket refrigerator water filters do not work well . If the water filter on your LG fridge is installed properly and you are using the correct type , check the water lines to see if there is a blockage . How long does it take to dispense an 8 ounce glass of water ? -RR <p> Wanted to leave a note that the information from Kim and your replies helped . Had almost exact symptoms on our Maytag Fridge where the light would not go off in front and the ice and water would not work . I went and pressed the lock button and it came on and then pressed the features . The light went out finally and the ice and water features worked again .

Just a happy person and hope your site can and will help others . <p> I have a GE side by side fridge and all of a sudden it just stopped dispensing water but still making ice . I just put a new filter in about 4 months ago but i changed it again thinking that 's what 's causing the problem . Did not work . Pulled the fridge out and water line/tubes are n't  bent . What 's next ? ? <p> Stephen , Have you tried a different filter ? The new filter may be defective . The housing should not have anything to do with it . There is pressure in the lines possibly . Try a different filter and if the problem persists , you need to begin troubleshooting the water line and dispensing system . -RR <p> Stephen , To fix the issue with a refrigerator not dispensing water after changing the water filter , unscrew the filter and screw it back in again but tighter than before . Also , the filter may not be lined up properly . Make sure it is tightened all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little misaligned and this causes the water to not dispense correctly . -RR <p> Teresa , You may have a blockage in the water line that causes pressure and therefore dispenses water randomly . Try installing a new filter or remove the current one and reinstall tightly making sure it is properly aligned . Once you reinstall the filter , run the water dispenser for about 2 minutes to release an pressure that may be in the water lines that causes the leak . -RR <p> RR , Ignore my last post . The light went on that I must not have put something back correctly and redid everything . I knew I was successful when I shot water all over everything , but I have success ! I can control the lock out and dispense ice and water ! Thank you so much for your patience and assistance . Your site is an appreciated and valuable resource . Thanks again ! <p> RR , Checking the connections helped , I was able to turn off the lock out and change the ice settings . I can get ice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ multimeter , but will get one today , if that is the next step . Thanks again , Kim <p> Sunday morning it was working just fine , it would dispense crushed ice and water . At some point Sunday afternoon the lock out light came on and the filter light went from green to yellow . The ice light also switched from crushed to regular cubes . While it is making ice inside , the light panel will do nothing . The lock out light wont go off and none of the others will changes . I 've unplugged , as you suggested , I 've pressed the lock out button and held it for up to two or three minutes . I 've checked the door switch inside , making sure that it popped in and out easily . Nothing happens when I press on either of the dispensers , no click or hum , nothing . I had the model number incorrect , it is EC3JHAXRL00 Whirlpool . Any insight is appreciated . <p> Kim , Okay so trying to reset did not work . Can you give us a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right now ? Please be detailed in your description and we can try and assist further . -RR <p> We have a Whirlpool side-by-side . All of a sudden the lock-out light is on and it wo n't dispense ice or water . I cant get the light to turn off , or any of the others to change . I 'm guessing it is the circuit board , but am hoping there might be some trick to get it to reset . <p> I just replaced the actuator for the water dispenser on my Electrolux Frigidaire side-by-side following a You Tube Video and everything went smoothly except that I do not have a wire harness connected to the the face panel . Instead , a have sort if a flat ribbon holding wires . I had to remove and reinsert it to do the actuator replacement . I have no power going to the unit after putting it back together . Any idea why this is ? <p> Kathy , Check the parts list for your Electrolux Frigidaire side-by-side fridge and see what type of proper OEM electrical connector should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times the manufacturer will replace a wire harness and when you replace a certain part , a new wire harness is needed . -RR <p> I traced this same issue down in my Kenmore side by side . The issue I found was the line from the " fill tank " behind the crisper drawer leads directly under the freezers coldest part of the cabinet . Its actually inside the cabinet frame of which can not been seen . This is where it freezes . <p> Problem : Frozen line exists somewhere in the line may or may not be able to be seen . <p> To Test : Get a catch pan for water . Disconnect the clear plastic waterline coupling in the front of the refrigerator directly under the freezer door ( again on a side-by-side ) and put water collection pan in place to catch all water . Note water may actually feel ice cold again a good indicator of a frozen line somewhere . Check for free water flow at this point ( assuming water flow is on and fridge is plugged in ) Press the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the water dispensing of the fridge ) No Water is caused by the waterline frozen between the Fill tank that runs in the frame of the refrigerator . ( Be careful not to try and run the water dispenser to much as it could apply to much pressure to the fill tank causing it to rupture leaking in the fridge itself ) . <p> Solution : Defrost the freezer or whole fridge if possible . The lines will warm and thaw easily . Test line in the above process until line flows . Then reconnect water lines and Enjoy ! <p> I removed the filter and was disconnected the water line that supplies the dispenser from the valve . I blew into that line easily , and water came out of the dispenser . So , I removed the water supply line and tried to blow into it , but nothing happened . It hit me that this line goes directly to the filter housing . If must have a shut off mechanism or a bypass mechanism in the filter housing ; if it did not , then every time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of the filter housing . <p> So , I do n't  think I know what the filter element is . Can you clarify ? I did a Google search for Kenmore Elite 106.57799700 water filter element and came up empty . <p> It turns out it was the valve . The inlet valve and the supply valves are all one piece . It cost nearly $100 , but the DIY was well worth it . I changed it a week ago , and everything is working well . Thanks for the help . <p> I forgot to add that the water has been running fine since the one time I identified after I put the old filter back in , and , while I do have the rear cardboard panel off , I do not hear the rattle any longer . <p> As I was getting ready for bed , it hit me : disconnect the line that runs from the filter housing the to valve at the valve . I did that and blew air through it pushing the water out . Maybe it already cleared when I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the water line , and I do n't  hear the rattle . <p> I will keep an eye on this further . If the valve needs to be replaced , I can do it pretty easily . The valves for the intake , output to the ice maker and output to the water dispenser is all one assembly .

@@13196784 @1796784/ <h> 5 Ways To Dry Your Clothes Faster In Your Dryer <p> There are many very easy ways to get your dryer to dry your clothes faster . Below we have 5 simple methods that you can try to get your clothes dry when you really need them and in a hurry . <h> Multiple Suggested Methods To Drying Clothes Faster In your Dryer : <p> Suggestion 1 : If the clothes that you need to dry fast are something as simple as a few pairs of moist jeans , then add a large dry towel into the dryer with your wet jeans . Adding a dry towel to your dryer acts as a moisture separator . The method that works here is that by adding a large dry item , part of the moisture from the damp clothing is taken away by the dry towel . Thus reducing the moisture level inside of your dryer . This allows each item to dry much faster . You can experiment to see if you can reduce the drying time in your dryer by using this easy method . <p> Suggestion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dry . If your clothing is soaking wet then realize it will take hours to dry anything that contains that much moisture . Put your clothes back into the washer and run the " spin and drain " cycle to completely get the extra water removed from your clothing . This will take an extra 10 minutes to run and complete . By doing this you will save drying time . After the spin cycle is complete , put the needed clothes into the dryer and run on " high heat " for 15 minutes . <p> Suggestion 3 : When your clothes come directly out of the washer , only take out the clothes needed to be dry at that time . Separate them from the main part of the wash and put the clothes needed for now into the dryer . Put the dryer on " Auto High Heat " and run for 15 minutes . This is usually an appropriate length of time to dry moist clothing . <p> Suggestion 4 : Remove the dryer filter screen and make sure there is not a large amount of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ screen can have a huge affect on your clothing not drying fast enough . So make sure to clean it out after each time using your dryer . If you do this then your dryer will always be running at its most efficient level . <p> Suggestion 5 : Before you even need your clothes dry , try pulling out the dryer from the wall and remove the aluminum colored air vent hose from either the wall or the dryer itself . Clean this large tube out by using a brush and remove any excess lint that has accumulated over time . By removing the excess lint you will be opening up the air flow so that your dryer can work in an efficient manner and dry your clothes faster . <p> Bonus Suggestion : Make your dryer vent hose shorter . The first thing to do is disconnect the hose and clean it out by removing all of the built up lint . Then cut the hose to be long enough for you to still pull the dryer out a few feet from the wall . Cutting the vent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more efficient . Depending on if your dryer is electric , propane , or gas , this can save you an average of $25 dollars per year . With the vent hose shorter , the dryer will dry the clothes 20% percent quicker . 
@@13196785 @1796785/ <h> How To Fix A Dishwasher Not Cleaning Bottom Or Top Rack <p> If your new or old dishwasher is not cleaning like it used to , here are some DIY tips to help you fix the problem . Whether your GE , Samsung , Bosch , KitchenAid , Frigidaire , Whirlpool , or Maytag dishwasher is not cleaning , all dishwashers work using the same operating principle . The first thing you should check ( whether the dishwasher is not cleaning well on the top rack or bottom rack ) is to figure out if the issue can be from hard water . This should be done before removing any of the parts from the dishwasher . <p> Commonly , your dishwasher will not clean as well because of:1 . Hard water deposits are clogging the holes the water sprays out of.2 . The water temperature is not hot enough to clean the dishes and glasses properly.3 . The spinning water spray bar or bars have seized up from gunk or foreign debris . <p> Dishwasher spray arm water holes may be clogged <p> If hard water deposits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to fix this is to get a small pointy object ( such as a paper clip ) and push it into the holes on the top and bottom spray bars . Doing this will open up the holes and free it from gunk so the water can easily spray and clean your dishes . This is not a permanent solution . This will only fix the problem temporarily . To fix this problem the right way , you need to remove the water spray bars and clean them out . This is not difficult and should only take you about 10 minutes to remove . We recommend going to Google and typing : " How to remove dishwasher spray bar for Manufacturer# Model# " . Once you have the spray bars removed , soak them in CLR or Lime Away for 30 minutes . After soaking them for a half hour , run them under hot water until all the hard water deposits are cleaned out and removed . Reinstall them the same way you took them out and run a wash cycle on hot without any dishes . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that may be left over . After the cycle is done , look in the bottom of the dishwasher to make sure there is not anything blocking or clogging the drain . ( If your dishwasher is not draining out the water , then there can be a variety of problems . ) Once you assure there is nothing blocking the drain and the inside of the dishwasher is sparkling clean , go ahead and run a load of dishes and you will see how much better it cleans . Problem fixed ! <p> Another issue can be that the water temperature is not hot enough to efficiently clean your dishes . This one can be tricky . To raise the temperature of the water going to the dishwasher , you need to turn up the water temp on your homes hot water heater . This will make the water hotter going to your dishwasher . It will also make the water hotter to everywhere else in your home too . You can raise the temp by 5 degrees and see if that helps . If you do raise the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shower as the water will be hotter ! Here are instructions on how to adjust the water temperature on a hot water heater with instructions for both gas and electric water heaters . <p> If you believe the dishwasher spray arms are not spinning , it is usually because of hard water deposits . So if you followed the above steps and cleaned them out , then they should spin or turn . If you suspect they are still not spinning or turning , there could be something jamming it . The bottom dishwasher spray arm will most likely not turn if something has fallen down and is blocking it from spinning . Check to make sure nothing is blocking it from turning such as a broken piece of glass or a utensil . If nothing is physically blocking the spray arms , then it is possible that a water connector tube that supplies the water has become loose or disconnected . This could also be because the water pump or water filter could be clogged .

@@13196786 @1796786/ <h> Dryer Makes Squeaking Noises How To Fix <p> Is your clothes dryer noisy ? We will show you the most common causes for a noisy dryer . Most of the time an older dryer ( gas or electric ) will squeak and grind when parts begin to wear out . The most difficult aspect of fixing your clothes dryer is knowing exactly where the noise is coming from . Knowing what parts to remove and replace is key to repairing this yourself . Sometimes all you may need to do is lubricate some areas inside your dryer to fix the noise for good . NOTE : Always unplug any appliance from electrical power before attempting repairs . <p> Below is a complete list of dryer parts and where to locate them inside of your dryer to stop the noise . Please note that this list of parts may differ in names or location on certain dryers . The parts we list are generalized and for all dryer brands and types including GE , Kenmore , Maytag , Whirlpool , etc . Check the dryer diagram below to find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Drum Slides The drum slides ( aka Glides or Pads ) are there to support the front of the tumbling drum . As the drum moves it rides on the glides and they wear out over time . When the drum slides wear out , you will hear a " metal to metal " scraping or grinding sound . The best thing to do is remove and replace ALL of the slides in a set if any one of them is worn out . <p> Idler Pulley This idler pulley provides tension on the drum belt . The tension the pulley provides makes it so the belt will not fall off . Usually this pulley will fail from years of heavy friction . A squeal type of noise can be a good sign that the idler pulley is worn . The idler pulley should roll freely when the belt is removed . If it does not , it should be removed and replaced . This pulley is located next to the drive motor usually at the bottom of the dryer . To gain access to the idler pulley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Drive Belt A frayed or damaged drive belt will cause your dryer to make loud noises . A damaged belt causes the noise as it rides on the pulleys . A " every so often " squeaking noise is usually the sign of a worn out belt . A dryer drive belt is a thin band that goes around the entire dryer drum . It rides on a tension pulley and the dryer motor pulley . If you find the belt in your dryer is worn out , replace it with a new one asap . <p> Drum Support Rollers If your dryer makes a rumbling type of noise the support rollers may be worn out . These rollers are usually on the rear bulkhead but some models may have them in the front of the dryer also . When these support rollers wear out , usually the drum will not rotate easily . So if your dryers drum is not moving freely , then most likely the rollers are worn . Drum support rollers will wear out evenly and all of them should be replaced at the same time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the front panel and the dryer drum . <p> Drum Support Bearing The dryer drum bearing is there to support the back of the drum . If the dryer makes a scraping or squeaking noise then this bearing is probably worn out . Remove and replace this bearing if you find it to be worn or damaged . The dryer will need to be taken apart to install a new bearing . <p> Blower Wheel The blower wheel can collect a large amount of lint and other gunk . When your dryer is noisy with a strange noisy pitch , there may be lint buildup on the blower wheel . You can simply clean the lint or buildup off of the blower wheel to quiet the noise . Another issue with this wheel is the sleeve within it may wear out . If so the wheel will vibrate and cause noise . Remove and replace the blower wheel if this is the case . <p> How to fix a squeaky noisy dryer <p> If you have any other suggestions as to why a dryer would be making noises , please @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having the same issue . 
@@13196787 @1796787/ <h> Cancel Satellite TV And Turn Your Existing Dish Into An HDTV Antenna <p> Tired of spending too much money on your Satellite TV bill ? Well for around $50 you can purchase and easily install an HDTV Antenna that will give you quality HD TV programming . Of course you will not get as many channels as before using DirecTV , but there are hundreds of channels available broadcast into the airwaves for free from the stations you already know and love . This is a tutorial for most people who can no longer afford the cost of satellite television . Cancelling DirecTV or Dish Network will save you from $75 to $300 dollars a month . Admit it , most of the channels that you are paying your hard earned dollars for are completely worthless . Cancel the service , buy an HD Antenna , and get Netflix . You will not miss most of the TV you watch and you will be saving mountains of money per year . So ditch the monthly bill and follow our tutorial below for saving your money <p> Step 3 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your existing Satellite Dish . <p> Step 4 : Install the U-bolt that is included with the antenna and secure it tightly in place . <p> Step 5 : Connect the already existing coaxial cable to the HD Antenna . ( The cable is already going from your TV from the dish , so just disconnect and re-attach to the hd antenna ) <p> Step 6 : Check all connections to make sure everything is secure and tight . <p> Step 7 : There should already be a coaxial cable going into your home from the roof . If it was disconnected then look along the side of your home for a connection like this and plug back in . <p> Step 8 : The next process involves finding out which direction in the sky your local channels are in . You will need to point your antenna in a certain direction for best reception depending on where you live . Go to Antenna Web , FCC DTV MAPS , or Antenna Point and type in your info to find out which way to point your HDTV antenna . Once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in that direction . <p> Step 9 : Turn on your TV and set it to " Antenna " and let it " Find " the available free stations . Then check the signal meter to see if it is strong . If all is good you are done ! Free HDTV ! HDTV That is broadcast free is from 720p to 1080p HD quality ! <p> Of course you do not need an old dish to install a new HD Antenna . You can install one in your attic too if you desire . But remember that HDTV Antennas work best when attached to a roof and there are no obstructions . <p> Here is a small chart for " how to connect and combine signals from 2 antennas facing different directions " if needed . <p> Is the ground really not required ? I had dish and there is a small copper wire running down the coax from the satellite towards the splitter but it just ends and is n't attached anywhere . I think its intended to be the ground but should n't it be attached at the splitter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dish until last week . I went up to roof and the dish had one coax coming off it with the small wire running along that coax . The small wire stoped right before the splitter the coax was attatched to . Then I have a coax coming out of the other side of the splitter into the house . <p> I thought the small wire from the dish was supposed to be attached to the splitter screw . Looks like Dish never attatched it as it stops right before it ! <p> We have some sever storms coming through today so I took it down . I may have to call someone as my electric box is actually about 40 yards away in the ground and I do n't  have a clamp where it enters the house . <p> I am very surprised that it appears dish never grounded my satellite when they installed it . <p> I finally got the courage to climb up to my dish on the edge of my roof . I had to take off the arm of the dish and come down to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ antenna to it . Next I carefully climbed back up the ladder to screw the arm back onto the dish and hook up the coax . On the ground I had to replace the two DirecTV splitters with amplified distribution splitters to get everything to work . I did n't  use a preamp on the antenna because it knocked out channels rather than boost them . <p> I have direct tv to 5 tvs Coax goes into direct tv box and hdmi comes out to tv Cables are in the wall . Will the signal go through the direct tv boxes through the hdmi to tvs ? Or do you have to connect the coax directly to tv ? <p> I just replaced my DISH with an antenna . I hooked up the coax from the DISH , but when I went to program it , the TV did not recognize the antenna . It said an antenna was " unavailable " . Have you come across this before ? I would check the antenna , but it should pick up a tower 15 miles away , as it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Joseph , Is it possible you are connecting the wrong cable ? You went into the TV and chose ANTENNA not cable and ran a channel scan ? There may have been extra or numerous cables , be sure you are using the right one . -RR <p> #3 here is where my question is . I have n't been up there yet but I imagine the dish bracket is grounded i see the grounding wire on side of my house . that is great ! but , do i need to ground the antenna too ? ? ? <p> Does it matter because it is now attached to the dish bracket with that metal u thing ? <p> For those of us not talented enough to do this ourselves , what kind of person do you hire to do it and where do you find them ? ? ! ! Would it be a regular electrician or is there some sort of specialist ? Thanks ! ! <p> I think I am going to do this . I have Dish Network now , going to the main tv then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Is it just as simple as installing this antenna and plugging the coax into it ? After doing so I would just have the question of will all my TVs receive the HD antenna signal ? Would I try to keep my Dish box to pump this signal out somehow ? Do I buy some kind of other box ? I am confident it can be done just cant visualize it right now I mean all my TVs have coax going to it so Also , perhaps will do this in conjunction with SLING TV . If anyone has moved from Dish to HD Antenna/Sling and got it on all TVs with limited equipment let me know . <p> I inherited a a slimline DirecTV antenna from the previous owner , in reviewing your previous post " Theresa from August 2015 " mostly fits my situation with the 16swm distribution block . However , I have a total of " 4 coaxial cables " coming from the antenna ( which based on Bens posting Feb 2016 ) its the different SAT azimuths ( which makes sense to me ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ garage which in a good distance from the house . I found the SWM power module in my attic ; so i 'm assuming its what 's powering the SWM16 unit . I disconnected the Power-IN ( Coaxial ) and plugged it into my new Channel Master CM3414 4-Port Distribution Amplifier for Cable and Antenna Signal splitter . <p> 2nd question : What do I do with the single coaxial coming into the garage ? I 'm assuming is being split somewhere before reaching the house . <p> I currently have AT&amp;T Uverse w/2 wireless boxes ; but , the technician has all my bedroom runs disconnected , so i 'm a little perplexed with best approach to the problem . My goal in to have all TVs with a HDTV signal ( 9 in All ) 4 outside ( 2 in garage and 2 on patio ) and 5 bedrooms . <p> I have a Dish satellite and removed the LNB . There were 2 coax cables running from the dish to a Solo Node on the exterior of the house . There was one coax running from the Solo Node into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Solo Node as well as the one running into the house . I tried each of the coax cables from the antenna with a F-F coax connector ( one at a time of course ) . Neither coax cable picked up any channels . TvFool says all the major channels are at the 115-120 heading from my house , and have oriented the antenna to point that direction . The antenna is pointing at the same angle as the satellite used to , and is pointing over the roof ridge line . There are n't  any other obstructions , trees , homes , etc . I only have one tv in the house , and do n't  plan on adding any . The coax run from the antenna into the house is a decent length , would guess around 30-50 ' at termination at the receiver , etc . Do I just need an amp to boost the signal ? Getting frustrated with what should be a very simple project . Thank you very much in advance ! <p> Ben , You should be able to use the existing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no channels then a signal booster may be needed . The channel master amplifier for cable and antenna signals should solve your issue . Make sure the coax cables are secure and there is no damage . Sometimes a coax cable can bend in a certain area and the cable inside snaps . You can actually use a meter on it to be sure it is not damaged . If the coax is okay and you add the amplifier , it should solve your issue . Let us know what you find and how it works for you . -RR <p> Very good and interesting write up on this satellite conversion to break away and cut costs from cable TV . After reading the article a couple times and reviewing every comment in the post below my only question is this I have obtained a DISH Network satellite dish and I will be purchasing said RCA HD antenna as you have used , does the Dish satellite do anything to amplify or enhance the HD antenna ? Would I still get everything that you are showing if I were to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tv had 2 coaxial cables hooked to the dish and in side my home it all has 2 coaxial cables to connect to the tv or box . Is thete an adapter or does anyone know how to do it with this kind of hook up ? <p> I just did this today . Works perfectly ! I bought the suggested RCA antenna and this amplifier . I have four cables on my dish since I had the Genie and two DVRs with DirecTV . So a lot of tuners = multiple cables on your dish . I took the cable with the red ring around the base of the connector which is the main line and plugged that into my antenna . Then I went into my attic and found where they had attached their equipment and lines , found the lead from the dish . ( Again it had a red stripe so was easy to find . ) I plugged that into the 8 port amplifier above , removed all the lines from DirecTVs splitters , and plugged each of the lines to the five TVs in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capped the three extra ports with F-Port Terminator Caps since I only have five TVs . Once I plugged the power in and scanned for channelsVoila ! ! ! crystal clear reception on all five TVs with over 40 channels ! You just have to be sure to remove ALL of DirecTVs boxes from your lines including the power box that they plug into one of your cables . I live in Downtown Orlando and I did n't  even have to move my Dish to the east which is recommended . I left it pointed southwest and it picked up all the OTA channels in my area . I have added a Channel Master DVR+ to my main TV and I now have a complete 2 week program guide and can record up to two shows at a time on that TV with no monthly fees at all ! Thanks so much for this post because it led me in the right direction ! ! Hope my information helps those with multiple tuners on their DirectTV . Only a hundred bucks to make the switch ! ( If you are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is $300.00 plus $50.00 for a One TB Hard DrivebutNo Monthly Fees EVER and you get an onscreen program guide similar to DirecTV . That is so worth it to me ) This is the best day EVER ! <p> I will be using the Direct TV dish to mount the antenna . My question is will I need to disconnect from my direct TV receiver box or will the new antenna work through the box ? My TV is mounted on the wall with all cables hidden in the wall . If I have to disconnect the receiver it will be a major pain to reroute the cables . <p> Kenneth Halpine , You should be able to use the existing cables . Most people do with NO issues . The cables from the dish to the box are the same you would use if you were starting from scratch . You are good to go . -RR <p> Jennifer , If the SAT dish has a clear unobstructed view of the correct position in the sky , then no it does not need to be on your roof @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sky in the right direction . Some people have them on the patio , or mounted near a window . -RR <p> This works perfectly for us in Mentor Ohio . I had to add a RCA preamp but everything was so easy to hook up and it works for 2 TVs in the house because the previous cable lines already had the splitter . I suggest everyone to switch to OTA and cancel your cable all we pay for here is internet and Netflix and we save over $100 a month now ! Best information and instructions . Its not rocket science anyone can do this . <p> I currently have Direct TV with one dual tuner in the living room . I only have Direct TV channels in the living room and bedroom . If I use this method would I be stuck with the same option of only receiving the antenna channels on those two TVs or can I make it work for more room ? <p> Kerri , If you use this method you should be able to use the Direct TV and the antenna @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then change the input on your TV when you want to switch from watching Direct TV to antenna . -RR <p> I have read about how some satellite companies put scramblers on their coaxial lines . Do you know if Dish does this to theirs ? Also I am about 36 miles away from where a majority of the TV towers are and I am looking at going with the ClearStream 2V Long Range Indoor/Outdoor HDTV Antenna . Does anyone have any experience with using this antenna and what are your thoughts of it ? <p> I am wanting to convert my old Dish network satellite to HD OTA antenna . I know how to mount an HD OTA antenna on the mast . The problem is there is dual coaxial running out of the old Dish network satellite and into the house . Do i need to use 2 separate antennas for each coaxial or just put a splitter on the antenna and hook the dual coaxial to it ? <p> My antenna is a " 1byone " Amplified UHF TV antenna Kit sku : OUS00-0551 . Its has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made and sturdy . I would like to go to a Radio Shack but they all closed down in our area this past year . I have checked on Amazon but I was n't sure of what I was supposed to be looking for at the time . I will look again to see if I can match the specs for the one I have . <p> My problem with my new setup is that the antenna I bought has a amplifier with it that probably should go before the splitter . I ca n't put the amplifier in the line until after I split the signal so I am using the amplifier for only one TV . I suppose I need to buy another amplifier for our second TV . Do you have any suggestions about what I need to buy and where I can get it ? <p> Jim , You can buy another amplifier for the second TV or cut into the wiring on the antenna and add an amplifier before the splitter . If you are unable to do this then yes adding another amplifier to the second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place to buy splitters and amplifiers for cable coax wiring is Amazon ( online ) and Radio Shack ( in store ) . What antenna brand and model are you using ? -RR <p> We are getting 27 channels now with this setup . That 's about 5 more than we were getting with a small indoor antenna . I spoke to an electrician about the ground and his reply was " it ca n't hurt " . So I ran a ground wire from the new antenna to the clamp that Charter uses for our internet service . I feel better doing that since I do have a 8 ' steel pole on my roof now . <p> I am installing a antenna using the base of a directv dish on a fence line post and I 'm using Quad shield RG6 coax . My question is do I need to ground this setup ? I noticed on the old directv coax that it has a ground wire attached to it but its not connected to anything . <p> Hi-I did this the other day and it gave us 20 more channels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your antenna ? Dish made me give back the node so i was wondering if it was necessary to ground . <p> FlyTye , have no fearwe only ever could get 12 channels over the air . I do n't  live in or anywhere near a big metropolis ! However , I might try it with the 4 way splitter that I already have and may be able to send the other one back if all still works well . <p> Theresa , I 'll admit that I did n't  look up your brand of antenna up at first . It sounds like you have an amplified antenna . Sorry i was thinking your antenna was non amplified . With your antenna already being amplified then the advice I gave you earlier would be bad advice . If you have a regular splitter ( non amplified ) lying around or could go run and grab one at an home improvement store ( should be pretty cheap ) or so , try that . From my understanding ( and someone correct me if I am wrong ) you should not have 2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its ok ) The 2 amps may be interfering with some of your channels , so see how it operates without the amplified splitter . Once you 've done this rerun a channel scan and see if you get more channels this way . If you find the signal quality good on all of your TVs return the amplified splitter . <p> Well , FlyTye I got the 4 way amplifier and connected it all up and got nothing . No power on the antenna . I grabbed the amp that came with the antenna and connected the cable from the antenna to it . I then connected a cable to the " out to tv " port on the antenna amplifier and then to the in port on the 4 way amp . The 4 way amp also has a cable connected to its " power in " port . It looks kinda messy but the light came on the antenna and I have perfect reception on my 3 tv sets . Of course all that work for 12 channels may be kind of a waste of my time and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " gray power inserters " inside the house . I 'm trying to understand what you mean by that . There should be nothing connected inbetween the antenna and the splitter ( the amplified one ) . You should simply have the antenna&gt;the line going out from the antenna&gt; line into the " in " port of the splitter . Disconnect all swim units ! Everything else I think we are on the same page on . <p> FlyTye The only problem is I already disconnected all cables from the 16 channel SWM unit and all cables from the direcTV 4 way splitter . Now if I understand you correctly you are saying leave the cable plugged into the SWM 16 channel unit where it says swm/power and plug it into the power section on my amplifier . Plug the antenna into the " in " port on the amp and the other 4 cables that lead into the house into the " out " on the amplifier . I think I have one , maybe two , gray power inserters connected inside the housesince that supplies the power to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into it ? If that 's the case , I am not sure how that will workbut I can try it when the part gets here . <p> Also Theresa , Just thought of something .. That swim unit is already being powered by one of you coax cables in your house . Just take whatever cable is plugged into the power side of the swim unit and hook it into the power side of your new splitter . Then trace wherever DTV has their plug ( in your house somewhere ) and replace it with the adapter that came with your unit . I just did a little reconfiguration with mine , but this should work for you if you do n't  need to make any changes . <p> From the looks of it and the reviews on Amazon , what you 've ordered should work just fine . It works exactly the way I described earlier with the exception of it being a four port splitter . Try it out and if you have problems ( which I doubt ) just return it for the one I mentioned- as it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Good Luck = Its awesome not having to fork over $100 a month to Directv anymore ! <p> The antenna looks great . I live approximately 55 miles from transmission towers and was wondering will I have much luck pulling those signals with this antenna or should I invest in making/buying a larger one ? <p> Theresa , Replace the DIRECTV-Single multi switch with something like LONG ... This is what I bought . Your antenna may not like to be split with splitters that are non- amplified . Every time you split a signal you will have signal lost . If you live close enough and are receiving strong signals from your TV towers you can generally split using a regular splitter to- 2 TVs at most without pre-amplification . In your case ( and mines as well-just did this about 3 weeks ago ) you will need an amplified splitter or pre-amp to compensate signal loss for your splits . I have the item in the link above hooked up on 5 TVs and our picture quality is excellent on all TVs . I live about 35 miles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ antenna the OP referenced , but splitting your signal is all the same regardless of brand . Be sure to place this unit as close to the antenna line in as possible , I would say no more than 20 feet or so ( keep line- in as short as possible ) . <p> So basically I have : 1 ) Antenna on the roof- mounted on old satellite mask with a single line going into my attic 2 ) The single coax line ( about 8 feet ) feeding into the amplified splitter ( " in " on box ) in the attic bolted to one of the rafters 3 ) I had coax runs where DIRECTV had 2 coax lines feeding into one room when they where using the dual tuner DVRs that required 2 separate lines . Being that I only need one line for the TV in our master bedroom , I used the additional line to power the unit . The unit receives it power via coax so I took the end of the unused cable , plugged it into the adapter and into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the " power " section on the amplified splitter . The splitters led will light up when it has power . 4 ) The splitter is located in the same place the DIRECTV Splitter-Swim unit was hooked up . So all the lines to all my rooms are already there . At this point you just connect all the lines you want for each room into the " out " ports . <p> ( If you decide to go the preamp route you would just need to get power to the preamp and use a regular non amplified splitter . ) Hope this helps . <p> Thanks for the response . I figured it out . When I followed the cords from the DirectTV dish under the house , I found the wires had been cut altogether from my system . I could n't get into the Cable junction box on the outside of the house ( I 'm assuming because I currently have internet and they did n't  want me adding something ) , so I ran the cut directtv cord right below the spot where the tv is located @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the direct tv cord to the wall . <p> I had direct TV . It was set up to operate 4 TVs . On the satellite the LNB had 4 connectors . These cables are connected at the bottom of another box ( 16 Channel SWM ) ( go here if you want to see what the box looks like : DIRECTV-Single Multi Switch Channel which is connected to the side of the house . On the other side 2 more cables that indicate swm are attached on one side . No cables are attached on the opposite side . It says Legacy . My question is where do I connect my outdoor antenna ( Its a Taotronic and I 've read it does n't  like splitters ) so I can have the option of sending that signal to all the TVs in the house . I 've read the above comments but do n't  see an obvious answer to my problem . <p> I currently have cable internet and a flat antenna behind the TV . The previous owner of the house left me a direct TV satellite in the back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see it it improves my signal . My one worry , however , is reconnecting the direct tv cord will interrupt my cable internet since the signal travels through the same coaxial cables through the house . Will I have to run a second coaxial with the antenna signal behind my tv ? <p> Richard , Usually DirectTV will not use the same coax as your cable internet company . Should be separate if there are 2 companies involved . If they are " Sharing " the same coax , buy new coax cable and use that one for the TV. -RR <p> My existing Direct TV dish is an SWM dish . Where the cable enters the house it connects to an SWM ODU box that plugs in . The signal enters and exits this box before being connected to an 8 port coax splitter which is where all the signals branch off to each room in my house . What do I do with this ? Do I remove it and replace both the 8 way splitter and SWM ODU unit with a signal booster or will this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I just wanted to give an update . I went back up to the roof and unscrewed the cable that was going through the arm of the dish and was connected to the antenna . As I had suspected , it was a problem with that coax cable the pin was broken ! I disconnected the coax cable behind the dish , and hooked the antenna to that . Success ! ! Thanks so much again for providing this site ! <p> How do I change my TV back so i can search for channels for a antenna tv . The dish tech set the tv on channel 60 so the satellite would work , but I can only see what is playing in the den , I have no box to work this TV . I hooked the antenna back up to the TV and disconnected the satellite cable but when I search for channels it still remains on 60 . <p> Carol Wallin , Are the 3 wires the same color ? Are all 3 threaded into a small metal box ? There is probably 3 that go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Can you describe or explain more in detail ? Can you refer us to a picture of what you are looking at ? -RR <p> I think well give it a try and since the dish is mounted on a pole we may be able to add an extension to raise it up . We are about 5 miles from the TV Towers that are located in Mason City , Iowa . I 'll keep you posted ! <p> Thanks for the feedback . the current cable from the dish runs underground from the garage to the house , so it looks like this project cant work . I really do n't  want to dig up the yard again to bury a new cable . And I 'm just not understanding how the cable was working 1 day ( with the satellite ) and is bad the next ( with the antenna ) . I understand that cables go bad , but this does n't  make sense to me . I think I 'm better off paying someone to do this for me . Thanks again ! <p> Sorry about all the questions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off the satellite pole and brought it inside and hooked it up to the TV . I got 5 scrambled pixelated channels . I took the previously purchased , RCA indoor/outdoor antenna that was giving me local channels out to the satellite pole and got nothing . So.I believe my troubleshooting reveals that there 's something wrong with the cable that is attached to the satellite dish , since both antennas work when hooked up directly with a different coax cable to the TV , and neither antenna works when hooked to the coax on the satellite dish . I do n't  understand this . If DirecTV cut the service , would n't that just affect the dish , not the cable ? <p> Nancy , Yes the dish was affected but the cables can not be as long as they are not going outside and out of sight , they may be cut . Or possibly the cable that you are using is damaged . Buy a new heavy insulated coax and run it from the antenna . Then try your test again and see if the results are different . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , correctly positioned , with quality coax cables going to the correct places . -RR <p> Ok . I 'll try your suggestions . I 'm about 20 miles from the broadcast stations . I cant move the antenna up , since there 's no room for movement with the dish in the way . I 'm using the antenna you suggested . I did n't  replace any of the cables . I 'm using the existing ones that are attached to the dish . <p> Thank you for your quick reply . I really do n't  know what the dish cone is , and I 've googled it and think that its the unit wi the 3 white disks in it . I was able to get everything connected , with lots of lefty loosies . I checked all the connections and I 'm getting no channels . I had an amp with an RCA antenna that I had bought , but I 'm still getting nothing . Perhaps I need to get a signal booster and amp as you suggested ? With the RCA indoor/outdoor model , used indoors , I picked up 2 -5 channels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do you think ? <p> Nancy , Yes you can try getting a signal booster and a good amp . Try moving the antenna further up and pointed in the direction of the TV towers . How far away are you from the TV towers in your city ? Be sure you have everything connected correctly and tight . Be sure the coax cables are of good quality . Not the Walmart types that are brittle and have horrible insulation . Tinker with every aspect of it and you should be able to get at least 20 channels if you are in the vicinity of towers broadcasting HD. -RR <p> Help . I finally figured out that the cone is the plastic rectangular piece with the 3 white disks on it . After hours on a ladder trying to pry that thing off , I finally got it . Now Ive spent another 30 minutes trying to get the coax cable disconnected from the LNB/CONE . It will NOT twist out . What am I doing wrong ? Do I need a hex wrench to get this undone ? Isnt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come off with simple tools . You are trying to remove the coax cables from the dish cone right ? It should be just threaded on . Lefty loosey righty tighty . If by chance you have a different setup than normal , if you see allen bolts , then yes use the allen or hex wrench to remove . Are the coax cables just threaded really really tight onto the unit ? -RR <p> Rene , You may need an amp and splitter depending on how everything was installed . The easiest way to find out is hook everything up with the new antenna and if signal is not great then you can add an amp . Have you checked to see how far away you are from the HD TV broadcasting towers ? -RR <p> Thanks for all of this ! ! will try it out and one last question , for amp and booster which product should u buy ?

Please let me know if there is any step went wrong for this 1 ) I have a Satellite Dish and i 'm going to purchase the RCA antenna on internet as you mention and setup it later just like you on the picture . 2 ) I 'll connect the coaxial Cable to the RCA antenna and connect it to my TV antenna input . 3 ) I 'll start search TV channel for available channel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this DIY project will work on here ? <p> Hello . A couple things : I have seen it asked but a couple times but am still not clear . My DirecTV was connected to 4 tvs . If I hook up the antenna to the coax going from the dish to the house will it be able to transmit to all 4 tvs ? It seems like the DirecTV signal came in and was able to be split to the 4 tvs so the antenna signal should be able to as well , right ? Also , I had heard that by definition , the dish does amplify the signal to the antenna ( if placed properly ) , the same way it amplified the DirecTV signal to the eye . Thank you . <p> I have a Dish Network Dual LNBF. 4 cables run to this dish and back to an outside splitter . When I terminate Dish they will want all their equipment returned . How to attach these 4 cables or what type of splitter do I need ? Do I need an amplifier ? <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grounding block wired to a ground rod before the antenna wire enters your home . It wont necessarily prevent all damage from a direct lightning strike , but it will help . -RR <p> I have ended my TV service with Comcast but I still have internet with them . So , from the Electric pole to my house is 1 line and then a 5 way digital splitter 1 is cable coming in and 4 going out to each room in my house . Looks like they have split off one line in Main room with Big TV &amp; Internet ( my problem ) . I want to use existing cable line &amp; splitter to hook up my new MOHU SKY 60 Outside Antenna ( with amp ) and Channels device . This is a multi-directional HDTV Antenna with a remote ( like cable ) that gives you a Channel Guide . I want to know if I can plug outside Antenna into one of the 4 room lines that is not the main internet line and it will make the other 3 rooms come in . I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll have to run a separate line to TV possibly with another splitter . Any help with this would be great ! ! I think i 'm on the right track , but if not let me know . Thanks so much . <p> Just cancelled DirecTV ! ! ! ! I currently have the HD dish on the side of my house and the local tv station antennas are up on a mountain about 10-20 miles away . I have a couple of questions for you . I have ordered the RCA antenna you recommended , will I need to get an amp for this or will this be all I need ? Also , there are multiple cables connected to the Directv dish , can I use any of those to connect the antenna ? Thank you for your time . <p> OK I am new to this . I moved into this house and the house already has 3 satellite dishes attached to it . is there a way to combine the signal ? I ask because according to Antennapoint.com with my direct address plugged in and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to 60 miles away . So what would I need to get the best reception ? <p> Can I do something similar ( using the old satellite cables/hookups ) but place the antenna in the attic ? What would an attic installation involve ( step-wise ) that might be different from everything described above . The current satellite dish sits right above our garage . Our attic entry is in the garage . I 'm thinking I 'd have to remove the coax from the satellite dish ( and roof ) and find where it enters the house and see if I have a direct line from that entry point to run the cable to the attic . Does that sound doable ? I realize an attic install depletes signal , but I already get a few stations just with rabbit ears , so I think I 'll be fine signal-wise . <p> Worked ! The signal is not strong but it works . Couple of questions ? Does placing the antenna at the base to the dish improve the signal ? ( I placed farther away than the where you have it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make any difference to the signal ? My dish was tilted so that the widest part of the dish was not perpendicular with the roof . Would this help satellite signals but hinder the analogue ( ? ) signals I am trying to get ? I did not use an amplifier . Will the above changes not make much of a difference and I should get an amplifier ? Thanks . Great article . Sticking it to the man ! <p> Kevin , Most of the things listed will not make much of a difference . If you get an amplifier , then you can experiment with moving some components around and fine tuning . An amplifier will help . How many channels are you currently getting and how is the picture quality ? -RR <p> I am really wanting to cut the billI have noticed that if I set this up it appears that there are 2 cables coax coming from my dish which is routed into a switch i.e. " Solo Node " for the two hoppers . Am I going to have to remove that and get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if I only run one line from the HD antenna ? Or am I better off using a splitter up high to bring it down to one cable for the HD antenna &gt;&gt;&gt; leaving two ins to the Solo Node model # 185834 . <p> Tim , Yes remove the Dish switch node . That is used for Dish signal only . You will need a splitter . A 3 to 1 splitter will work . Put the splitter wherever is more convenient and less work for you . Less work is using the existing cable from the dish down and then add splitter but can be done whichever way you wish . Whichever requires less coax cable is best . -RR <p> I really want to get rid of Directv and try this . Bought the antenna you all recommended and havent shut off my service yet . I am having a hard time with the cables . You cables seem to run through the antenna but mine has the end part on which i cant seem to get off for the life of me . Any suggestions . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can get before cancelling service . <p> Sean , Not sure what you mean by the end part of antenna you can not remove . Can you explain in more detail ? You should be able to simply use the existing cables . Disconnect the existing cables from the dish and install on the antenna . Then remove the cables on the dish box in the house and attach to coax input on TV . Set up your TV to search for new channels using antenna mode . That should tell you if it is going to work before you cancel DirecTv. -RR <p> On the outside of my house , where the cable goes in , there is a 4 way splitter , and a two way splitter . I 'm assuming the cable with the biggest nut is directv coming in . It goes out to the two way splitter . Two go to the right and two go to the left . And one goes into the house where the dvr is . <p> Can I take the cable from the dish , plug it into the antenna @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cable comes into the dvr ( soon to be gone , I hope ) ? <p> The splitters are outside so I ca n't put the amp before the splitters . <p> Steve , If you are asking if you can take the coax coming from the dish to the antenna , yes . You are simply just using the same cable that the dish used . Also , yes you can hook up the power unit inside where the cable comes in . Test everything out and see what channels you receive . If the signal is low because it is split in multiple areas , you should be able to put an amplifier BEFORE the splitter or splitters . Find out which wires go where and if you want certain cables to go into certain rooms . If you are only having the antenna signal to supply a few rooms , remove any extra wires that wont be used . You can remove splitters too if needed . As you stated above , it seems you have multiple splitters . Remember less is better when it comes getting a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lower signal quality , so remove any that may be unneeded. -RR <p> Hello again . Back to being confused . Its been too cold and windy to do any outside work , but I did get a powered hd antenna . If I plug into the antenna from the dish on roof , this power unit shows it plugs into it and the power unit goes to the tv . I do n't  think this is going to give my other tvs the benefit of the antenna , is it ? <p> Where do I put the splitter in the line from the antenna to be able to use it for all of my tvs ( 4 ) ? <p> " Splitting the video signal between 4 different TV 's will produce about 12 db of loss which is too much . However , if you use a Video Signal Amplifier or a Video Distribution Amp , the picture on all 4 televisions should look great . Just make sure to add the Amp BEFORE the 4 Way Splitter . " From Melodys post . <p> Hi , I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to shut me off , what happens when you use the antenna through their cables ? It will just automatically work ? Also , does the directv dish and mount belong to Directv ? Is there a problem with them if you mount another antenna to their equipment ? thank you <p> Steve , The cables used are coax and are the normal everyday cables used for any antenna also . If you cancel then your situation may be unique . Call them and ask what they take and what will be left . Do you own or rent the dish and mount ? Obviously if you rent , they will take . -RR <p> DIY Project Help Tips , thanks again , I did manage to find a site to show me where towers are in my area . I should mention I live in Newfoundland Canada and in the province there are six towers but they are all listed as vhf . does this mean I can only receive local channels or is it possible to get uhf as well ? <p> Pat , Getting reliable UHF DTV @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miles ) is difficult . Most digital broadcasting is broadcast in UHF . Only a small hand full of cities broadcast digital in VHF . However , you should be able to get the six towers depending on the power they broadcast at and actual distance and signal type . Let us know what you get once you get everything hooked up and tuned in correctly . -RR <p> Pat , It may not be accurate . Try Antenna Web or Radio Shack has a good article for pointing outdoor antennas . Hope that may help you a bit more . You should be able to get at least 2 stations if you have a long range antenna . -RR <p> I have tried to look where towers were with tv but it does n't  give me anything . I even tried putting in address from nearest town where I live and it does n't  give me any channels . I wanted to hook it up at a cabin in the woods even if I only got 2 or 3 channels would be good . Cabin is 20 miles from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 150 miles on a 25 ft . Mass , my old dtv system used a swm , ( single wire multiswtich ) , 1 ; will an antenna work through a swm ? 2 ; local stations are 15 miles away and 3 major cities with broadcast stations each 90 miles away , will i get stations from all 4 cities ? <p> Frank , Does the SWM have a number after it ? Sometimes its a 4 or 8 . How many wires were going from the switch while the Dish was setup ? Either way a long distance antenna may work using the switch depending on the switch itself . Give it a shot and it should work . If not you will need to replace the switch . Also , is there a splitter installed in the line too ? <p> Using a long distance antenna , you should be able to pick up all stations . Since you have a 150 mile , it should technically work . Just be sure to " point " the antenna in the proper direction . -RR <p> Pat , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dish models and brands . Your second question , how far off the grid are you ? Have you determined how far the HD broadcast towers are from your present location ? -RR <p> Jason , It may be possible but no guarantee . You may need an extra long range HD antenna . Check other antennas to find one that can go even further . Many of the descriptions on Amazon or other sites , will tell you max range . Choose the furthest range . -RR <p> So glad I found this ! We are getting so gouged by our cable provider , I 've had it ! Now the issue is we are surrounded by trees , quite literally in a forest . We have great view of western sky , nothing but trees all around other directions . Can this still work ? And is it possible to obtain any internet doing something similar ? I 'm desperate to get out from under then , and I 'd love to not have to get DISH or DirectTV to do it . Thanks for any advice <p> Mary , Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ RANGE antenna for HD TV . If you are in the forest , it may be difficult to get a good signal . You would have to buy a mounting pole and put the antenna on that . For cable , if you are in the forest , the only other alternative is satellite internet mounted to the roof . Which would probably be more money that a normal coax cable for internet going to your home . How far away are you from a main city that broadcasts television signals ? -RR <p> Previous owner of my home was a tv geek . The entire house is wired to the teeth . There are two directv satellites outside , one on a 4+4 about 8 feet up and the other on the corner of the roof . Neither terribly high so quite accessible . Removed the cone with two attached coax that had been cut easily . There are two remaining coax cables in the channel that eventually go into the house ( there are also two from the other satellite dish , also with the cone cables cut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coax connections going into the house . Is this a trial-and-error as to which will go to the cable port where my TV is ? I only have the one tv . Just hoping there is a simpler way of troubleshooting this .. <p> Jeri , Just trial and error . Hook a coax cable to your TV to see if you are getting reception and if not , label it " CUT " and move to the next . Keep doing this until you find the one that is not cut and or working best . Make sure your antenna is pointing the correct direction for the location you are in approximation to the largest city near you . -RR <p> Hi I hooked up my new antenna to the existing dish antenna and I am getting no signal to my tv when I go inside and try to scan for channels . However when I disconnect from the outside dish and bring the antenna inside the house and hook it up directly to the antenna outlet on the tv I get like 50 plus channelsMy question is why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outside old dish mount and use the existing dish coax I get no signal ? is there some kind of filter dish has in they 're system that prevents me from using they 're coax or do I need a signal booster ? Please , any advice would helpful . Thank you in advance . <p> John Lawrence , First , make sure the antenna is facing the correct direction on your roof . Then add a signal booster . This should give you the channels you are getting when directly hooked to your TV . Also , you may have a bad or weathered coax cable running from the roof to the inside of your home , thus giving you zero channels -RR <p> Today is Feb. 3 , 2015 . Bought the antenna you recommended and am having a guy connect it on Feb. 7 , 2015 , which is the ONLY day he has to give me . Legally , do I have to cancel my Direct TV BEFORE I can disconnect the satellite and use the existing cable for my antenna ? Thanks for your prompt answer ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the coax cable coming into my house . There is a splitter from the main cable provider feed that then goes to the 2 feeds into my house . I disconnected each feed on the house side of the splitter one at a time and figured that one of the lines is for my internet . Can I assume the other line will provide TV and that is what I should hook my antenna to ? <p> Pete , Not necessarily . Most coax cable lines carry both signals . If there is a splitter it probably means that one line feeds into one room and one line to another . Do you have 2 coax hookups behind one TV ? Do you have multiple rooms for coax hook up ? Your cable layout may be different than most , do some tests to see . You may also want to look into an amplified powered splitter to boost both signals . -RR <p> Did this last week when I moved to a house . Well worth it . Now I actually talk to people instead of staring at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $40 for just internet . Only thing I did different ( not sure if better or worse ) was removing the entire satellite dish portion and reused the mast . I get the basic 5 major networks and a few odd ones in between .

Walls look cleaner and now I have one less thing keeping me up at night . <p> I just cancelled Dish Network . So I thought I could plug one of the three lines that were going into the eye of the dish to my outside antenna and that would give me reception going to all three TVs . I tried each cable and none gave me reception . Am i doing this wrong ? <p> Thanks for the response ! I took the new TV downstairs , plugged it into the downstairs outlet and ran the channel search and it picked up all the channels . Took it back upstairs , plugged it into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing . I 'm stumped . <p> Mike , Did you do a test to see if the coax cable is working ? Try hooking something else to the cable to see if it is not cut somewhere in the wall . Also try and follow the wire up to the roof to see if there is any visual damage . -RR <p> I installed HD antenna on old DISH receiver , plugged coax cable from wall to TV downstairs and got lots of channels . But on new TV upstairs , when I plugged coax from wall to TV it did n't  pick up any channels . When we were DISH customers , both outlets worked fine . But with antenna only one outlet works . Shouldnt the antenna signal also split to both outlets ? <p> Mike , The only plausible reason for this ( if both walls were wired for DISH ) is that the TV that is not receiving the channels may not be on the correct setting to " find " channels . Make sure the TV is set to " antenna " and not " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now i have time warner cable . I still have my dish , I use roku and would like to get rid of time warner , my question is , how would i hook this antenna up from my satelite to the box . since I know have cable and cable put a huge splitter in the cable box outside . <p> Kevin , Since you are using cable tv right now , if you cancel cable they will cut ( or simply disconnect ) the line outside your house . All you have to do is run a cable ( or use the existing ) from the dish on your roof into the old existing cable hookup box outside your home . You have to do this so the cable connections on the inside of your home are then connected to the dish ( or antenna ) on the roof . Then simply hook up the cable from the wall in your home to the TV. -RR <p> I am having a problem with Step 5 . I have the same antenna that you recommended . I did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There is no cone . When I take off the end of the dish where I think the cone should be , there are about 3 coax cables but none with a loose end . 2 questions : 1 ) do I use the loose coax cable ( or how do I have to unhook something else ? ) and 2 ) how do I connect the connector from the antenna to the coax cable on the roof ? They do n't  seem to fit easily . Thanks in advance ! <p> I installed a RCA ANT751 antenna and connected it to my old dish . I added a pre-amplifier to the assembly . I ran new RG-6 coaxial cable and connected to the existing cable runs in the house . According to AnntennaWeb I should receive at least 12 channels at a distance of 10-13 miles at 250-256 degrees , from Norfolk , VA .

Then , I moved it up the post some more and VOILA36 channelsboom ! Good luck and be sure to get those locations . <p> I followed the instructions and only was able to get 2 channels . I had previously used an indoor antenna and was able to get 12 channels that were intermittent . I know that all of the connections are tight .

If the signal is not strong enough , then buy the amp . Hope this helps ! -RR <p> Hi D , We are 27 miles from the transmission towers for HDTV that is transmitted through the air for free ( using an HDTV antenna ) .

@@13196789 @1796789/ <h> How To Fix A Leaking Washing Machine <p> Here is a troubleshooting guide to repair and fix your leaky washing machine Instead of calling a repairman and spending from $75 to $200 dollars on a service call , here are the most common reasons your washing machine will leak . We will assist you on diagnosing and repairing that leaky top load or front load washer . Whether it has flooded the room or it is a small dripping leak , you will find the DIY solutions to fixing it yourself right here . <p> The MOST COMMON REASON a washing machine will leak is clothing overload and or excessive suds . If your washer leaks , first try removing the clothing after the cycle , run the machine with NO CLOTHES and NO DETERGENT on the quickest wash cycle . This is to determine if you have a true leak or if the machine was simply overloaded . If the machine still leaks then you have a genuine leak . If it does not leak then you probably had the machine overloaded . NOTE : Make sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with your front loading washer . If you are not , the machine will create excessive suds and will leak or stop the tub mid cycle . <p> The next area to check is the water supply and drain hose at the back of the washer . There is one hot water hose , one cold water hose , and one drain hose . We know it may be difficult to move your washer away from the wall so try this first To tell which hose may be leaking , observe the washer during different wash cycles . If the washer leaks from the back when filling with water , then more than likely one of the water supply hoses are not tight or need replaced . If the washer leaks when in the spin or drain cycle , it may be that the drain hose is not properly secured or needs replaced . If the washer leaks from the bottom or underneath when in wash mode , the leak is coming from a part that is inside your washer . <p> If the hoses are in good working order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ground . Sometimes a washing machine can move around when in the spin cycle . Make sure it is not leaning in any certain direction . Your washing machine may have feet that can be extended or retracted to get the washer level .

@@13196792 @1796792/ <p> Your curtain rod bracket , toilet paper holder , towel bar or picture frame wall anchor has been pulled out , fallen out or has become loose , how do you fix this ? First of all the reason it fell out was because you installed or attached it into drywall . Drywall anchors are fine for many uses and applications , but if people will be pulling indirectly on the object it can loosen and fall out over time . When we say " pulling indirectly " we mean a towel bar , curtain rod or toilet paper holder . These items can be loosened from the wall as they receive indirect force on them daily . A picture frame usually does not fall out of a wall because it is never touched. - ( Here is a Drywall Anchor Animation to help you better understand a plastic drywall anchor . ) The BEST fix for something that has fallen out of the wall is to install the towel bar or whatever you are reattaching into a Stud . <p> A stud is the part of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2+4 that is supporting your walls and this is what the sheet of drywall is screwed into to hold it in place . You can purchase a stud sensor or electronic stud finder and use it to find the wood stud in your walls . <p> Normally a wooden wall stud is placed every 16 to 24 inches so if you are able to move the object that you need to hang a few inches to the left or right , you can attach the object into wood instead of drywall . If you do install the item that you are reattaching into the wooden stud , you can use normal wood screws or drywall screws to secure it . Just make sure they are long enough to go deep into the wood and support the item you are hanging . If you can not attach the item into wood and your only option is installing into drywall , then read on and see below . <p> If you have no other option and have to install into drywall , then here are a few options and tips . First @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ common for securing something into drywall . If you are installing a picture frame or wall decor , then this is your best option . Just make sure to install them properly and use 2 or more if the picture frame or wall decor is large and heavy . If you drilled holes into your wall that are too big for the plastic wall anchors to be snug , you can re-drill the anchor holes a few inches away from the originals ( and fill in the mistakes or loosened holes with drywall spackle ) . NOTE : Make sure to leave enough space in between the old loose holes and the newly drilled holes to avoid causing a weak point by not leaving enough drywall in between them . If you are using normal plastic wall anchors and not the self drill type , make sure you are NOT using a drill bit that is too fat or wide . Choose a drill bit that is about 1/3 the thickness of the plastic anchor so that the hole will be tight enough for the plastic anchor to not loosen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , take a hammer and lightly tap the plastic anchors into the holes you just drilled . If you are using the self drilling type then just simply screw them into the wall . Once your anchor is in place , screw the metal screw into the anchor and hang your picture frame or wall decor art . <p> When attaching a towel bar , curtain rod drape bracket or toilet paper holder into drywall , the best type of wall anchor to use is a- Toggle Bolt . A toggle bolt fits through the drywall and a spring loaded wing nut " opens up " and securely locks the bolt in place . First drill your hole using an electric drill . The hole you will need to drill in your drywall when using a toggle bolt will be larger than you think so read the package that contains your toggle bolts for the proper size drill bit to use . Once your hole is drilled into the drywall , slide the toggle bolt into the hole of the bracket of the item you are hanging ( such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are hanging ) . On the other end of the toggle bolt , attach the spring loaded wing nut on the very end of the bolt to allow for the spring loaded nut to get behind the drywall . Carefully slide the spring loaded end of the toggle bolt into the wall far enough for the spring loaded nut to " open " and secure itself behind the drywall . Lightly pull on the toggle bolt to make sure it has sprung open and is secure . If it does not pull out of the wall after you pull on it , then begin to slowly tighten the toggle bolt until it is tight , snug and secure . Repeat this with any other items that need secured to your wall or items that have the probability to become loose over time from people pulling on them . <p> Use toggle bolts for heavy items when attaching into drywall <p> Many different types of wall anchors for drywall , wood and metal <p> The many different types of plastic wall anchors for drywall <p> A properly installed plastic wall anchor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much to whomever explained toggle bolts so clearly .

Did you just open up your dishwasher and found it filled up with water or there is water all over the kitchen floor ? If so then it is obvious your dishwasher has a problem draining the water . There are many things that could be the cause of the problem . You do not need to call a repair person as of yet . There are a number of simple things you can check yourself to fix your dishwasher . <p> SOLUTION 1:Is something at the bottom of the dishwasher blocking the drain ? Check the bottom of the dishwasher for a piece of food or a foreign object that could be blocking the drain . Sometimes if a glass cup breaks while in your dishwasher , a piece of glass will fall and cover up the drain . Use caution and stick your hand in the water and feel around for anything that should not be there . Use a flashlight if necessary and remove whatever may be blocking the drain . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Usually a few screws hold this in place . Remove the cover and see if anything is clogging it up .

If the dishwasher is draining properly , you fixed it . <p> Check the drain basket at the bottom of the dishwasher for anything that may be preventing it from draining <p> SOLUTION 2:Did you recently install a garbage disposal under the sink ? If so the knock out plug has probably been left in the disposer . This will prevent the water from draining out of the dishwasher . To fix this , remove the plug on the side of the garbage disposal so your dishwasher can properly drain out the water .

Usually your dishwasher will be located right next to your kitchen sink . There is a water drain line that goes from your dishwasher to the garbage disposal or the bottom of your kitchen sink . Look under the kitchen sink and make sure that a box of detergent or similar is not pushing against and crimping the drain hose . If it is not crimped , it is possible the drain hose may be clogged with a chunk of food or from long term build up of food particles . Get a screwdriver and remove the drain line from the side of the garbage disposal . Blow air through the line to make sure there is nothing clogging it .

The check valve could be stuck in the closed position . This valve is what prevents water from returning to the dishwasher after the water drains out . If the valve gets stuck in the closed position it completely prevents the water from draining out of the dishwasher . The check valve is usually located in the outlet of the pump attached to the drain hose .

Before proceeding with what is listed below with the unit still plugged in , open the fridge compartment and check to see if you are getting air flow from the units left side mounted air diffuser . This is a small vented apparatus that allows cold freezer air to circulate throughout the fridge compartment.mine had ZERO air coming out . I surmised that since I could see the ice buildup on the freezer side that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in that little diffuser box was also a possibility as well as possible defrost component system failure(s) as well . As always regardless of how minor , please unplug the unit . I then used a shop vac to blow &amp; vac dust away from the fins in the bottom front of unit after the removal of front , &amp; possibly the rear sturdy cardboard panel may be necessary ) . <p> Yep I made a mess in the kitchen area with the flying dust ! The rear fin access panel is located towards bottom on the back side of course . Remove food and all shelves in the freezer compartment to include ice bin and the rectangular metal ice auger turning assembly located at the rear and directly behind the ice maker by taking out the four screws near all 4 corners ( not sure what the exact name for that part would be ) and unplugging its wiring harness . This is the unit that houses the light bulb . I then removed the upper air duct housing that funnels cold air from freezer to fridge compartment ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pops up ) . You may have to remove the right screw holding the ice maker down , and loosen but do n't  remove the left screw , this will allow for the upper air duct panel to clear the ice maker water inlet tube . I proceeded by then dropping the thin sheet-metal freezer rear wall panel ( very easy 4-6 screw job ) . This will allow for the rear coils of the freezer to be exposed , you will want to do this because it will eliminate the guess work involved with trying to figure out if you 've thoroughly melted all the ice from those coils . Not to mention it will also allow for quicker melting of the ice as well . It may be necessary to remove the " single screw held " three shelf holders on the right side of freezer compartment to ease the removal of this panel . <p> CAUTION HERE ! Next I used a very low wattage small heater sitting just inside the bottom floor of freezer aimed at the frozen coils and the ice completely melted in well under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here as NO amount of water or ice should ever be allowed to melt onto , or come anywhere remotely close to the heater as it does its thing . Please note also that while the heater is on , make certain that no internal components to include any fragile sensitive plastic parts are exposed directly to the heat that may melt , or warp them . This was not even remotely an issue with my model and may not be with yours but thought I would mention . Some other models may/may not have restricted spaces which would rule out this heater technique all together . A hand held hair dryer would suffice but you will have to be patient as it would take it longer to do the same job . Word of caution : Drop that ice pick or screw driver .. NEVER manually chip-away at the frozen ice.NEVER ! <p> After a while even though it was obvious the ice had melted , I allowed the heater to continue going for some time to leave no doubt . I then removed the heater and while leaving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to check the condenser fans operation to insure it was working as it should . Unplugged unit once again , put everything back together and using a digital upright thermometer on the fridge compartment and an analog dial type for freezer , checked the temps after approximately 1 hour and several times afterwards to insure that things were proceeding OK . This did the trick ! Air was also now flowing properly through the fridge 's left mounted air diffuser as it should . No icing or air flow issues and its been several days after the fact , long enough to where if I had issues with the defrost components it would have reared its ugly head by now . Freezer runs between -1 to 10 degrees F , the fridge is consistently within normal range as well 35-44 F depending on how I adjust setting . YEAH ! ! ! ! <p> Summary , I believe this whole issue was a possibly result o two things . I can remember going through one of the major holidays and absolutely packing both the fridge , &amp; fridge units @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flow of air . The other possible problem could have been an over accumulation of dust on the units fins underneath front , &amp; rear kick panels as mentioned above . Hope this can help someone ! <p> Howdy I recently purchased a 7.1 cu ft chest freezer . Its mostly empty at present , but I read that filling it with containers full of water can make it more efficient . I do n't  have many jugs/containers , but I do have deep plastic trays ( ie , no lid ) . Would you envision a downside to using these in place of plastic gallon jugs ( or something with a top ) ? Ie , since the water is exposed , might it caused frost to build up more quickly ? Thanks ! <p> Sandhu , Have you tried the methods above ? Where in the freezer is the ice building up ?

You should test either the defrost timer or possibly the main board has an issue . If you have ice build up then it will defrost and melt and go on your floor as you stated . Check into the defrost timer to see if it is part of the main control board or a separate component . You could try to manually defrost your Maytag fridge and let all the ice melt , then plug the fridge back in after it has completely defrosted and see if that may reset any issue .

I 've never had to defrost the fridge , so these instructions will help me do it correctly . Its a good thing that you listed instructions to set the thermostat dial to the correct temperature .

It always seems that any issues always are from the simple things . I like that you give a lot of options to look at before I need to look for a repair guy . <p> How can you get rid of the ice blockage once its already formed in the fridge ? Should you let it melt or try to chip it away ? You have great ideas on how to prevent it from happening again , but I need to know how to get rid of the ice that 's still in my freezer . Its kind of a mess . <p> Thanks for the tips ! There 's a lot of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few years . I 've always meant to do something about it , but I never knew how to go about defrosting a fridge myself . Its good to know that all it takes is unplugging the fridge , letting the ice melt and drain from it , then reset the temperature to the correct settings . I did n't  know that the reason for all of that ice build up was caused by the settings that I use for my fridge . What 's the correct temperature for my fridge so that I can prevent any extra ice from building up ? I would like to avoid having to manually defrost my fridge a second time if possible . <p> Jeff Hawley , Is the refrigerator still working properly besides the ice buildup ? There may be a defrost issue with the fridge . Have you tried manually defrosting the refrigerator for 24 to 48 hours , and then restarting the fridge to see if that may reset the fridge ? If not you may have a board or defrost timer that is malfunctioning. -RR

Using granite that was leftover from a granite counter top company , we bought a truckload very cheap . We decided to use it to make a great looking walkway using the recycled granite and common pavers . <h> What did we use and where did we get it ? <p> We purchased 3 pallets of big granite pieces and they were anywhere from 1 ? x2 ? to 2x3 ' . We had to sort through all of the granite to find the best pieces to use for our walkway . Now if you are wondering where you can get some granite pieces like the ones we used below , call a local granite counter top company or check Craigslist . Most granite counter top companies have to pay big money to dispose of the little pieces of granite they have no use for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know that you will take the next batch of " scrap " granite that they will be needing to dispose of . Most of the time they will give it to you free or charge you a small fee to take it . Either way there are so many different things that can be done with pieces of granite that even a small fee would be worth it . <p> Note : If you will be cutting the granite yourself to make the pieces smaller , wear a dust mask . Granite contains zircon crystals , a constituent of which is uranium . A decay product of this uranium is radon gas which can lead to major lung problems . Also . To avoid a slippery walkway , use smaller pieces of the granite . If you use larger pieces such as a sink cutout , it will be slick when it rains and you will fall . <p> The pathway has been cut out and we have begun filling it with gravel and then making it nice and level . <p> We laid out our pavers and- laid out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fit . Then the mortar was put on top of the gravel and we started to set the granite into the mortar . <p> Adding the granite was somewhat difficult because each had to fit perfectly within the border of the pavers . <p> Here is a closeup of how nice the granite actually looks when it is evenly put into the walkway . <p> Here we are almost finished with adding all of the granite and just a little ways to go until complete . <p> In this photo you can see that all of the granite is in place and set in the mortar . All we need to do now is seal the granite with grout . <p> Here is the walkway completely finished and it has been fully grouted and sealed . <p> Would you recommend this project in a sand yard ? What was your approximate total cost of the project after buying grout , the stone edges , and sealant ? Are there specific brands/stores you could recommend ? 
@@13196803 @1796803/ <h> How To Increase Water Pressure On A Shower Head <p> Your shower has low water pressure . How do you increase the water pressure or make the shower head increase water flow ? Well this question is asked many times by people with low water pressure in their homes . There can be many reasons your shower head is not spraying out high water flow . If the rest of the shower heads and water faucets in your home work as needed , then the problem is with the shower head or your bathtub showers water plumbing lines . If your home has low water pressure , then you will need a special " low pressure high spray shower head " that is made to increase the water pressure spray . <p> Most of the time people buy a new shower head to improve the look of their bathroom not knowing that the shower head they purchased is a water saver showerhead . Inside the shower head is a plastic or rubber washer that restricts the water pressure and causes it to be less than adequate . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it and look into the threaded tube to see if there is a water saving device installed . If so , you can make the hole in the washer bigger by using a drill or completely remove it using a screwdriver . Once removed or made bigger , install it back on the shower and test to see if the water pressure has improved . If unsure how to do this , do a search online for " how to remove the flow regulator in your shower head " . Doing this procedure will increase the water flow rate thus seeming to increase the water pressure . <p> The easiest solution is to completely replace your shower head with a low GPM water saving shower head . Older shower heads have a high flow-rate , which passes a larger amount of water through a larger shower head at a lower PSI . A smaller water saver shower head has smaller water spray holes . When you have the same amount of water flowing through a smaller hole , the pressure increases much like when you put your thumb over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shower head water pressure video <p> Another cause of low water pressure in your shower is that the shower head is coated with hard water deposits . Sometimes the inside of the shower head will have a build up of hard water deposits thus it is unable to spray water out at the normal water flow . To fix this issue , you need to remove the shower head and soak it in a bowl of CLR , vinegar , or Lime-Away overnight . Here is a full tutorial on cleaning your shower head . <p> NOTE : In the United States shower heads are required by regulation to restrict water flow to save water . The law says they must deliver less than 2.5 gallons per minute . Because of this reason , some showerheads will deliver less than an ideal water flow or water pressure . <p> As a last resort To increase the water pressure in your home you can adjust the pressure reducing valve ( PRV ) . This will increase the water pressure which increases the PSI within your homes plumbing pipes . Please understand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adjusting your PRV , you can burst water pipes and make your dishwasher and water heater malfunction . So if you will be adjusting your homes pressure valve , please use extreme caution . Your home appliances need below 75 psi to operate normally so adjust the valve accordingly . <p> I just redid my master bathroom . I have well water with low water pressure throughout the house . I thought that replacing the values and some of the pipes would increase the water pressure . This was not the case . I then went down to Lowes and Home Depot in search of a shower head that would fix my problem . I have tried everything I could buy . Nothing , I mean nothing worked . I then began running searches through Google.com , bing.com , yahoo.com for low water pressure shower heads and the best shower heads for low water pressure . I came across Take A Shower LLC .

@@13196806 @1796806/ <h> How Does An Evaporative Cooler ( Swamp Cooler ) Work ? <p> An evaporative cooler , swamp cooler , desert cooler , and a wet air cooler cools air through the simple process of the evaporation of water . Evaporative cooling works by utilizing water vaporization . The temperature of dry air drops significantly through the transition of liquid water to water vapor and water vapor is essentially evaporation . This process can cool air with much less energy than with refrigeration . In extremely dry climates such as the Southwest portion of the United States , evaporative cooling has an added benefit of also moisturizing the air which prevents things from becoming to dry . Evaporative cooling always requires a water source and must constantly have water to operate and cool the air . <p> Evaporative Cooler " How It Works " Animation <p> How Does Evaporation Lower Temperature ? When warm dry air passes over a water source a part of the water will always be absorbed by the air . The more hot and dry the air is the more water will be absorbed and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ molecules will become gas in the hot and dry air and this process uses energy to change the physical state of the water . The heat will always transfer from the higher temperature of the air to the lower temperature of the water . When this occurs , the air is naturally cooler . Evaporation stops when it is too hot and the air becomes overly saturated and not able to hold more water . <p> How Does an Evaporative or Swamp Cooler Device Work ? An evaporative cooler is really just a large fan that blows air through water soaked pads producing a cooling affect . The fan pulls hot outside air through the pads and into the cooler and blows the cooled air out . <p> Evaporative Cooler Pads The Evaporative Coolers pads are most commonly made of wood shavings . Wood is a great material because it absorbs and holds moisture while resisting mildew . These wood pads should be replaced every season and cost about $40 for a set of good ones that will last . <p> HOW A SWAMP COOLER WORKS DIAGRAM OF OPERATION <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inside the cooler pumps water through supply lines that distribute water to the top of the cooling pads . When water reaches the top of the pads the water saturates the pads by dripping through them constantly . The water goes through the pads and collects in the bottom of the cooler . The small recirculating water pump sends the collected water back to the top of the pads and this is a continuous operation . <p> Evaporative Cooler Float Valve Water is continually lost through evaporation so a float valve is needed and adds water to the bottom of the cooler ( sump ) when the level gets low . During very hot conditions a cooler can use from 5 to 20 gallons of water per day depending on the size and CFM of the unit . <p> Evaporative Cooler Fan The fan has 2 functions , it pulls in hot air and pushes out cooled air . The coolers fan pulls the warm outside air in and through the pads . This is where evaporation occurs and the temperature drops around 20 degrees . The same fan blows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home or garage and cools the area by 20 degrees . <p> How Efficiently Can Swamp Coolers Cool An Area ? The temperature of cool air blowing out of a cooler will always depend on the temperature and the humidity of the air going into the unit . Also an evaporative cooler works the best at the hottest time of the day because of humidity levels and varying temperatures . <p> How To Pick The Correct Size Evaporative Cooler For Your Home ? For a swamp cooler to cool effectively it has to be the proper size for the area which is needing to be cooled . A small window unit will not cool a large room . The output of evaporative coolers are rated by CFMs ( the cubic feet per minute of air that the cooler can blow into your home ) . Figure out the cubic feet of space that is needing to be cooled and then divide whatever that number is by two . This will give you the CFM rating for the correct size of swamp cooler that is needed . <p> Benefits of Evaporative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this occurs every one to five minutes pushing out hot inside air and any smoke or odors and pollution that may be present in the home . Evaporative coolers and swamp coolers use as much as 75 percent less electricity than air conditioning does . An evaporative cooler costs less than half as much as an air conditioner and it will cool the same sized area . Swamp coolers operate on 120 volts meaning they do n't  need special high amp circuits like air conditioners require . An evaporative cooler can be plugged into any outlet unlike air conditioners . Evaporative cooling adds more moisture to the air that helps to keep wood and fabrics from getting dryed out . Evaporative cooling does n't  require as much ductwork as an air conditioning system requires . <p> Joann , You simply have the belt too tight . If you adjust the motor and the fan pulley too tight on your swamp cooler , the motor will shut off temporarily as it is overheating and it is thermally protected . Loosen the belt between the fan pulley and the motor pulley by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go . The belt should not be so tight that it stresses the motor to the point of overheating .

@@13196811 @1796811/ <h> How To Fix And Stabilize An Unbalanced Washing Machine <p> Your front or top loading washing machine can at times become unbalanced and vibrate . We are going to show you some common easy solutions to fix this problem . There are different factors that can make your washing machine wobble , shake , dance , and cause it to make a very loud vibrating sound . It does not matter if your washing machine is a top load or front load washer , the principals are the same . We recently received this question from one of our members See below . <p> Question:My washing machine started vibrating VERY LOUD today and dancing and rocking until things were falling off of the top . It actually moved around the laundry room I would say nearly 6 inches to the left . For some reason it is not stabilized correctly . I checked the floor to make sure it is on a level surface and also the " leveling feet " and they are perfectly level . So do you have any ideas how to fix it or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? <p> Answer #1 : If the washing machine " feet " are level , the floor is level , and you have not just recently installed the washing machine , then we would bet that this is from an " imbalanced " or " overloaded " washing machine load . The first step is to check that you do n't  have all the clothes on one side . If the " clothing " load is not overloaded or to one side , then it is possible that something fell off inside and the drum is no longer balanced . You may be able to open the front panel of the washing machine up and find out why just by doing a quick visual sweep . However , check that you did not overload the washing machine drum with clothes as this is the most common reason for a dancing and vibrating washer . <p> Answer #2:Check the washing machines " feet " and level them to make firm contact with the ground . If you have tiled floors then this is most likely the cause of the vibration . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Turn them to " loosen " and they will come downward and make contact with the floor . If all 4 legs make contact with the ground in the washing machines current location , the unbalanced and vibrating should cease . See Illustration below <p> Answer #3 : We had this same issue and we were not overloading it . The problem was because our washer drum had a slight defect that caused it to not be centered or properly balanced . When we washed clothes it would vibrate slightly and was not too much of a problem . However the noise was annoying and needed to be stopped somehow . We did some research and found anti-vibration pads that slid under the feet of your washing machine . These small rubber discs actually absorb the vibration defect on our washer and has completely stopped the noise . So maybe check those out and buy a set as they are not expensive and completely fixed our problem . <p> Answer #4 : Overfilling a washing machine adds stress and shortens the life span not only of your washer but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after washing you pull out a twisted pile of clothes , it is because the clothes could not properly move within the washer during the cleaning cycle . Not only does this not clean your clothes properly , but it can actually vibrate parts loose and make the washer stop working altogether . <p> I have a small 4cu size front loading Whirlpool washer . When it is on the spin cycle , there is an extremely fast spin that sounds like a jet engine . The washer dances and fell over on its side at one point . When I load the washer , I make sure that clothes inserted are of the same weight and balance each other . Also I do not overload because the washer is small . <p> I have a Samsung top loader washer which is in the recall for excessive vibrating . Mine will unbalance itself and continuously refill with water in an attempt to balance the load which is costing me money . The fix that they are advertising doing does n't  make sense to me to fix the unbalancing problem . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to buy a different washer but I know I 'll just get new problems with a new one . What can I do to fix this myself ? <p> My Hotpoint model hswp1000m2ww TOP LOAD washer made by GE vibrates , on spin cycle . So bad I always have to be nearby to turn it off . My problem is the clothes inside they all ways are bunched up on one side of the machine . Why does this happen all the time ? Machine is on concrete floor . It happens with all size loads . All water levels . Once I stop machine and even out the load by moving clothes around it works ok . I got this washer second hand . The balance concrete block under machine looks good , is not damaged . The four straps that hold drum top look good . The 4 rods that hold drum up look ok . I think has something to do with agitator itself , its loose and wobbles but seems to work ok . Once in wile I notice clothes get stuck under edge of agitator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part it snaps onto . I 'm thinking its might be some thing wrong with agitator . Maybe I should cut down FINS on agitator so it do n't  grab clothes so good . <p> AL , Put a level on top of your Hotpoint washer to be sure it truly is level . Even if the washer is tilted a few degrees off it can have the effect you just described . Get it completely level and then run a load . If it is vibrating then something inside is loose and needs to be checked visually . -RR <p> My 2012 Kenmore Elite washer sounds off balance during the first part of the spin cycle . It then evens out as the cycle continues and the drum spin picks up speed . My footings are solid and level .

I placed the rubber foot pads under each foot and revealed the cabinet . The washer performs all functions with the exception of the vibration . <p> Ted Burchfield , If your Kenmore top loader is vibrating , and the tension tub springs and pads were replaced , is it the tub that is still vibrating or is the spinning cycle causing a vibrating noise as if a panel or component is loose ? Where is the vibration coming from and what IS vibrating ? -RR <p> Anita , You should be able to put the tub bolts back in with the washer empty and that should balance it .

If get it on the stand should it continue to jump around ? ? <p> Candace , Have you checked to be sure your washer is on level ground ? If the washer is not level it can be pulled to the direction that it is leaning . Get a level and place it on top of the washer to be sure it is level . If not , adjust the feet on the washer to make the washer 100% level . You may be overloading the washer therefore causing an imbalance and the washer " walks " . You could install anti vibration feet to your washer which absorbs the vibration and keeps the washer steady when washing in spin cycle . The stand should help if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bottom that should stop the washer from " walking " . Just be sure the washer is properly seated and connected to the stand . -RR <p> Norma , Assuming you have a top load washer , the drum may have springs holding the drum in place to keep it centered . If one of the springs have fallen off or has become broken , you will have an unbalance issue . Check under your washer with a flashlight to inspect for a spring that has fallen off . If you have a front load washer , there are tension bands that hold the drum centered . Check your washing machine manual to find where they are located and how to access them . -RR <p> My front load GE washer has started to vibrate until you think its going to blast off .

I have tried it with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ YOU HELP ME ? ? ? ? ? I did a master reset according to the instructions and it helped some but you can see that the drum is spinning unevenly . <p> Jacci , We would suggest unplugging the GE washer from power . Open the panel to gain access to the inside . Carefully check inside looking for anything that may be loose or has fallen off . Usually there will be springs or something similar that will keep the washing machine drum perfectly centered . When the drum spins unevenly , usually something is worn , loose , or missing . You can type your washing machine model number into Google and look at the schematic . This will help you to make sure there is nothing missing . -RR 
@@13196812 @1796812/ <p> You just put your load of clothing in your washer , turned your back , and now it has overflowed all over the floor . There are many reasons for this . This will be a DIY fix guide for all TOP LOAD WASHING MACHINES . Front loaders work slightly different . Many older model washing machines that are a few years old may have this common issue . This is attributed to the wear and tear of everyday use that can vibrate parts loose and wear out parts over time . <p> The absolute FIRST thing you need to do is check the pressure switch ( water level switch ) . The pressure switch is what senses the water level using air pressure and tells your washer to stop filling with water . The pressure switch has a tube attached to it . This tube can vibrate off of the pressure switch and therefore your machine does not know when to shut off the water . Most of the time , the pressure switch has either become clogged or the tube connected to it has vibrated off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no way of knowing when to turn the water off . Usually you will find that the hose clamp or spring loaded screw clamp has become loose and the hose is no longer attached to the pressure switch . So , this is what you are going to check first . <p> You will need to clean up the mess the washer has made first . Then unplug your washer and remove the top front control panel to visually inspect the pressure switch and tube . Depending on the manufacturer of your washing machine , the removal procedure will be slightly different . We are talking about the metal panel where all of the controls are located ( see picture below ) . Usually there will be a few screws holding the control panel in place . So once you figure out how to get that removed , you need to grab a bright flashlight and find the pressure switch on your washer . NOTE : Some washing machines have the pressure switch located at the bottom of the drum . If you remove the front control panel and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remove the lower front panel to gain access . See your user manual or do a Google search for your washing machine . <p> On most top loading washing machines , the pressure switch is located behind the control panel . <p> Once you have the panel removed , locate the pressure switch or water level control valve and see if the tube is still attached . If not , reattach it so it does not vibrate off again ( zip tie and small hose clamp ) . Once reattached , put panel back on and test machine . If the tube is still connected to the pressure switch , then most likely the tube is clogged or the pressure switch is either stuck , clogged , or has failed . If the tube is not clogged up , then you should remove the pressure switch and clean it out to remove the clog . Remember , the air pressure from the washer goes through the tube and presses against the pressure switch . So you can push or blow into the pressure switch and see if it is working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and you fixed it , reinstall it and test the washer . If the pressure switch is burned or cracked we recommend to replace it . Many online appliance parts websites have your type of pressure switch / water level switch that include free 2 day shipping . <p> We feel we have described the most practical way to fix an overflowing washing machine . If you follow instructions better by watching a video , then see below for the same step by step procedure as above . <p> Washing Machine Repair Video Water Overfills , Overflows Washer <p> If you have more questions about doing this yourself , please ask us below and we will respond with answers . <p> I have a top load washer that overfills . The pressure switch functions normally and the pressure tube is clear . When the tub is filling , I can see water going into the pressure chamber but only fills slightly ; leaving no water to run up the water tube . When I unplug the pressure tube from the pressure chamber , I notice the water begins to rise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have a GE WHRE5260E1WW that had overfilled and began to spill out onto the floor . I 've checked the water level sensor behind the panel and in the front panel where the opposing end connects . Both are secure and there does n't  appear to be any blockages . What else can I look for ? <p> Matt , If the water level pressure switch is securely connected electrically , then check the water level pressure switch with a meter to be sure it is working and is getting power . If so , then check the water inlet valve as it may not be shutting off in time . Also if there is a small clear tube attached to the water pressure switch , be sure it is clean and securely attached . At times the small clear tube will clog up and prevent the pressure switch from working properly . -RR <p> We have replaced the water level switch and the washer is still overfilling with water . It worked half way through the wash then the cycle stopped . When we restarted it the washer just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it to drain and spin . What else could be the problem ? <p> We have an Asko 20005 Excellence washing machine20 years old . Its works fine but can overflow . The pressure switch has been checked and seems to work . We have unusually high water pressure ( eg. I do n't  need to buy a pressure cleaner for cleaning cars ! ) . I turned down the water supply tap to 50% and all overflows stopped , regardless of which type of wash we did . Could it be that our domestic water supply is just too high to have the machine run on full pressure ? <p> John Boyd , Try shutting off power to the washer . If the washer still overflows even when it is not getting power , this indicates that the water inlet valve is defective . If the water inlet valve is defective , replace it . If that is not the issue , you may need to check to be sure the water pressure switch is in working condition . -RR <p> This question is for my top-loading LG WT4870 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no matter how large or small my laundry load is . Its not overflowing all over the floor , but water is leaking out of the drum when it agitates because its overfilling . I believe it may be the pressure switch . Does anyone have any tips on checking that valve for clogging and/or replacing the part if needed ? I believe the part is not located in the top panel of the machine , but rather in the back , beside the drum . Any advice would be great . Thanks all and happy new year ! <p> Hallie , Yes the washer water pressure switch is located usually ( on top load washers ) behind the front panel and to the right . If it is clogged or has hard water blocking it , the washer may overfill or under-fill Remove power to machine and remove front panel to check to be sure it is not clogged .

The weight of the foam was not enough to affect the weight placed on the hinges . The door was still aligned with the latch bolt going into the cavity properly . <p> A lot of the suggestions here and in the videos are more related to acoustics than actual sound isolation . Acoustics will improve the quality of sound in a room and is done so with insulation board , foam , rugs , drapes , etc .

Or was it 45 &amp; 30 ? I forget ! <p> BUT , my neighbors all love it and I look forward to growing some wonderful herbs this year . <p> This project could be so much easier if you made it a square box , rather than a pyramid . Of course , it would not be as pleasing to the eye , but so much easier . Would eliminate mitre and angled cuts . It would also make it easier to have an unused center to save on soil .

And looks to be a simple build . My only change at this point addresses the amount of what I see as wasted soil , which increases the lower you go on the tower . Window Boxing each level where needed or building a secondary internal pyramid to form a back wall would eliminate the unneeded dirt . The very top of course and maybe a couple levels down would n't need this boxing or back wall . It would also lighten the entire assembly to ease moving it around .

I like having the soil in the middle . I would though , do something different with that plywood , and I 'd create some sort of automated watering ability , from the center out . <p> This is a very neat idea , I like the change to a 4 ?

Charlene <p> One thing you can do to prolong the life of the wood is spray the interior ( the part that will touch dirt ) with plasti-dip . I contacted the company and found out its non-toxic and safe to use around plants . I know for certain you can get it at Lowes . I 'm sure other places have it , too . But you 're talking major water resistance from the spray . <p> I was thinking about the drilling tip , I would also like to toss in the idea of leaving space between the placement of the sized boards and the post . Just enough to fill 1 to 2 inches full of rocks that way as it rains the soil is damp from each of the levels . Note to all those worried about cost , Find local place where random boards and general things are donated to be up-cycled OR find a local who has a wood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boards with imperfections that can be bought for very , very cheap . <p> I love this idea . My concern is the amount of money out into it for the wood to rot after multiple watering . Is there a way to make this cheaper ? I would be making 4 of these . I am also placing the pyramid into a large pot instead of having it on a base with wheels . COuld this be made out of pvc pipe to save money ? <p> Would it work to run a soaker hose in a spiral around your center column ? That would allow interior watering , drawing roots deep into the soil . <p> I guess my major concern is the longevity of the wood . That 's a lot of $ and time for something that might only last a few years . Not sure how you could construct this out of longer life materials though . Perhaps aluminum guttering stacked and set back ? <p> I was thinking that instead of using the 4+4 in the middle , you could use a 4 ? PVC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheap watering solution . Theres instructions online for making PVC " self-waterers " but the basic premise is being able to " fill up " from the top . <p> Ceder and redwood both have a long lifespan for planters . We create several design for the organic community here and all we use if redwood or ceder . You can use other woods like pine or walnut but this gets pricey .. Of course if you want a wood to withstand the watering issues Teak or Ebony .. they will last forever.however , unless you have an unlimited revenue stream.as in Richard Bronson type monies but you should be able to get 20-25 years out of this design with ceder or redwood . <p> I have built two pyramids this summer . Both have drip irrigation systems I fashioned from Rain Bird parts . The top three rows have one 1 GPH dripper per level . The next two levels have two 1 GPH drippers on each board .

The hose connection comes out about two feet from the ground and extends just far enough to get your hand on it . This system seems to work , but neither of the pyramids is fully populated , so it is kind of hard to tell . <p> Martha My garden is completely in containers since we have very limited outdoor space . We made a drip system from plastic tubing for drip systems , soaker tubing , and a timer . We attached the timer to our water pipe , cut lengths of tubing and put a section of soaker hose in each container . All of the end are plugged off with caps so water does n't  gush out . I set up the timer to early mornings for about an hour a day . This of course depends on where you live and how hot it gets . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want . I generally have 12-15 containers .

However , it does sometimes work , but not consistently across different cycles ( ie the same cycle works at some times , but not at others ) , so I do n't  think the pump is the issue . Also , it drains freely into an open bathtub , so subsequent drain is not an issue . I 've checked the belt , and its tight and in good condition . The drum also spins freely . Guessing a timer issue ? <p> Nikki , Yes it is most likely a faulty control board or timer assembly causing the issue of no drain .

If the washer works perfect in some cycles but not others , it is usually the timer is at fault . Be sure the wires going to the timer assembly are secure and not loose .

Depending on your washer , clean out the front debris filter . If your washer has no debris filter , you will need to check the drain pump and the water/drain lines connected to it as something is in there jamming or clogging the draining process . -RR <p> We just had problems with our 2009 Brada ( which is made by Samsung ) pfw36w front load washer this week .

Make sure the drain hose does not have anything in it causing a blockage . Make sure it is not bent or kinked .

After checking out the drain pump , both lines in and out , and finding no problem , I started to suspect the main @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long as I kept restarting the washer on the spin cycle enough times . After studying the schematic printed on the inside of the washer , I checked the leads going to the drain pump on the main board . Sure enough , when the washer was going into the spin cycle , there would either be 0V or 120V going to the drain pump . The " on " or " off " behavior , combined with the intermittent nature of the problem , made me think that a part on the board which controls the drain motor was going bad . I ordered a used board from someone on eBay , and after I installed that one , my washer now would drain every time , but would n't spin up due to a different problem with that board . So now I had two control boards that almost worked , and evidence that the problem was on the board , not with the drain pump or wiring . I had a closer look at the components on the used control board , and noticed a row of 8 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " . Bingo ! With some difficulty I got access to the relays on both boards , de-soldered the bad relay on my original board , de-soldered a relay from the other board to use as a replacement , then soldered that relay back in place on my original board . Problem solved . My washer works as new again . If anyone else with a similar problem is so inclined , the relays can generally be had on eBay for $10/each or less . Assuming you 're handy with soldering ( or know someone who is ) , you can do this as well . I would say that the hard part was getting access to the components on the board , since Samsung bathes the board with a quarter-inch or so of silicone sealant . Do all board manufacturers do this ? Anyway , I had to peel this away from around the relays by hand , using a pointed wooden dowel about the size of a pencil . You can generally find those in the kitchen supply section of grocery stores , etc . Getting access to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ board , and Dremel-ing away the part of the plastic housing covering that area of the main control board where the relays are . But should another relay go bad in the future , I 'm all ready ! I probably would n't recommend this procedure until you 're ready to replace your main control board anyway , though . <p> Hi Kevin , I have a 8 year old front load Samsung washer . I have been having the " no drain " code . I have changed the drain pump out and replaced the drain sensor with no luck .

An unbalanced load may have caused it to fall off . -RR <p> My washer will not drain . However , if I set it to the spin cycle on another setting , it spins and drains ( ie : I wash a load on the regular wash setting , but have to set it on delicate to get it to spin and drain ) . It does this no matter what setting I wash our clothes in . Any idea what the problem may be ? Thanks ! <p> Peggy , We assume you have a top load washer. if so then the timer motor assembly is most likely causing your issue . Remove it and check with a meter or check for visible signs of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I found your website while trying to find a solution to our washing machine problem . I will do my best to explain what is going on and am hoping you have a good response for me . Our Maytag top load washing machine is three years old ( not sure if that matters ) and will not drain properly . When we ran the diagnostic test in the manual , it said it was something about the drain too . After a cycle on hand wash , whites , normal , etc , it appears like everything is fine ; however , when I go to pick up the clothes , they are soaking wet . If I move the tub inside around gently , I can hear the water at the bottom ( not visible to the eye though ) . I have been running the Drain and Spin cycle afterwards though , and it seems to take care of the problem . I can keep doing this , but it sure takes a lot of time on one load . My husband and I believe the problem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ husband , who is an awesome guy , did laundry a few times using way too much of our dry homemade laundry detergent ( it is supposed to be HE ) . The company said this problem would cost over four hundred dollars to fix . We , who are paying off school loans , can not afford that . My husband has tried fixing the washing machine . He checked the drain pipe and did this vinegar thing he saw on a website . The machine is still doing the same thing as before . This has been going on for a couple of weeks now . I think this is all the information I can give , and I hope it makes sense . Is there anything we can do to fix this ? We would appreciate any honest response . Thank you . <p> Lizzie Jo , It sounds as if the actual drain is partially clogged and therefore not ALL water is being removed . Gain access to the drain pump and take off the hoses to be sure there is nothing blcking the hoses where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pump itself . -RR <p> My LG top load WT5070CW has decided to stop draining after three years . The drain hose is n't clogged , its in the proper position . We replaced the pump . The " Smart Diagnostic " says to clean my drain . The LG service rep said to run a " tub clean " and that would unplug my drain , I 've tried two times . Still not draining . Any ideas ? Thanks ! <p> Paula , If the drain hose is not clogged , drain pump is new and free of debris , and diagnostics say to clean drain , then the most probable issue next is the drain itself . Have the drain checked or try and drain some water down it and be sure it drains properly . If so , you may have a loose wire harness in the washer . Have you opened up the machine after the new drain install and check ? Let us know what you find . -RR <p> I have a Samsung Model # WA5451ANW/XAA 02 . As it cycles to the drain and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It drains maybe half of the water in the drum then it stays stuck in this cycle . The pump is running but no water is being drained . A service man told me it was the " mother board " which has been replaced and the result is the same . Any help would be appreciated . <p> Mike , The issue you have explained does not sound anything like a control board being bad . You have a draining issue . Check all drain components including the drain hose for clogs or bends , check the drain pump for foreign objects that may be preventing it from letting the water pump out . -RR <p> So I went through the steps of checking to see if the water hose/sensor was working . It worked one time after that . Prior to that the washing machine was washing but would not fill with water . We have replaced the parts that connect to the water hoses that bring the water in the machine prior . Is it possible that the it is the pressure chamber ? <p> Dallas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you replaced the water inlet valve correct ? Is the water turned on on the wall ? Hoses okay ? No blockage ? You replaced the water inlet valve and the washer still will not fill with water ? Is the water inlet valve receiving power ? Can we have make and model of your washer ? -RR <p> I have a Whirlpool top loading Washing Machine Model LXR 7244JT1 . It is not draining . It goes through the filling and agitation cycles without any problem . Gets to the Drain cycle and it just stops . No sounds coming from the machine at that point . I have left it like that for a long period of time . The pointer on the dial does not move . I can dial it manually to the rinse and spin cycles and nothing happens . Get past the spin cycle mark on the dial and it starts agitating again . It does that on both the Normal washing and the Casual / Permanent Press setting . No sounds at all coming from the machine when it gets to the point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the drain hose that goes into the drain pipe in the wall . The lid switch has not worked in years , I stop and start it by pulling out the dial on the control panel and pushing it in to stop it . Since I can drain all of the water out by way of the large discharge hose , I assume there is not a stoppage between the tub and the discharge hose . Any ideas what my problem is ? <p> Donald , It sounds like the draining system on your washer is operating properly . If the timer motor is not working , the washer may not want to spin , drain , and final spin . There is most likely a bad spot on your timer motor and that is causing your issues . If the timer does not advance , the motor is shot . Buy a new timer motor assembly . If the lid switch is shot , buy a new one . Keeping your washer in 100% working order will help you to troubleshoot new problems when they arise . Here is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ replace for your washer . Here is the lid switch for your Whirlpool top load washing machine . -RR <p> I have an older Kenmore washer . I believe series 860 ( older as in early 80s ? ? ) . I narrowed it down to the capacitor . Changed it and the washer began to work . After 10-15 min it stopped and a humming sound started . Stopped the washer and let it " cool " down for 45 min and then works again and so on . Any suggestions on what it could be causing it to work and then " overheat " and stop ? <p> Countrychick , If you replaced the capacitor and it is overheating then stopping , you may have a motor issue . The motor may be faulty . If the motor is faulty the cap will most likely go bad fast . Check to see if the motor is wired properly . If problem persists , you may need to look into replacing the motor . eBay and Amazon have motors for sale at low prices if you need to buy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ load washer. #1 On large loads it will not spin fully dry and the ND error code comes on . I replaced the pump that had a broken impeller , but it still occurs . If I run the spin only , it still occurs . If I wait about half an hour and run the spin cycle it drains fully . I checked the hose and the boot on they are both clear . <p> #2 When I run hot water , it wont stop filling . I have to shut off the hot water and run a cold cycle . <p> Dan , #1 If you have replaced the pump and the problem is still happening , you may have an issue with the control board if you have to wait 30 minutes to get the washer to fully drain . It sounds like a timing issue and may only be repaired by removing and replacing the control board . Have you made sure that the wire harness to the control panel is secure and not loose ? <p> #2 If the washer will not stop shut off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loose solenoid where the hot water comes into the washer , test with a multimeter to see if it needs replaced . -RR <p> Wesley , Make sure the drain pump is getting power . If all drain hoses and drain pump is brand new , there may be a wiring , power , or communication error . Check wire harnesses and be sure the proper voltage is getting to the drain pump . -RR <p> I have Whirlpool Duet Washer . Had the F02 code . Cleaned the drain . Still got the F02 code . So I replaced the drain pump . Now I 'm doing the Diagnostic test .. it runs till C:06 runs for 8 minutes and I get the F02 code . Which I have already replaced . The pump runs.it is like the sensor which tells the pump to stop running is not working .. any suggestions . Other than buying a new washer ? <p> Kim , Whirlpool Duet Washer F02 is a drain error . What about drain filter ? Have you checked that it is clean and free of debris ? Sounds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the drain filter being removed and cleaned out . -RR <p> Muham , Samsung washer error code E1 means water supply error . The washer is not detecting that the unit is filling with water . Make sure you have water going to the washer . Check the inlet valve and water supply valve . Can you give us the model number of your washer to be sure the code error definition we have given you is correct ? -RR <p> We have a Kenmore Elite Oasis washing machine that will drain the water out , but the drain pump wont stop running so the machine wont go into the spin cycle . It started with a SD error code saying there were excess suds when it finished draining a delicate cycle load and would n't spin . We ran the diagnostic test on the machine and it came back giving us an F32 error which led us to replacing the CCU and the entire wiring harness . After doing all of that it was n't showing a code until we tried a few other things with the interface disconnected and when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us an F2 code It still has the same drain pump issue where it wont shut off after draining the water out . We have taken the entire machine apart and cleaned it thoroughly , checked the drain pump , motor , etc and still having issues Help . <p> I was told that the reason the clothes in my top loading Kenmore washer are coming out wet was because there is water staying in my drain hose and if I wanted them to come out drier I would have to spin them twice . I would like to know what this could possibly be from or what kind of repair this would need . <p> Sue , If you have wet clothes after the washer spins them , you may have a clogged drain pump or drain hose . If the drain pump is clogged the water will pump out but not ALL of the water which results in you having to run the washer again to try and spin the water out . Check drain pump and hose for blockage or clogs. -RR <p> I have a combo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that hoses are clear and there is power running to the drain pump , then replaced the drain pump . Still not draining . It makes a clicking sound when it gets to that part of the cycle then stops . Ive checked and dusted out the wires and the timer and the door switch and all seem to be okay . What 's my next step ? <p> Kira , If the drain pump was replaced and the same problem occurs , there may be a problem with the control panel/timer . Have you checked the other components with a meter to be sure the drain pump received the signal to drain at the appropriate time ? Checked wire harnesses to be sure they are secure and not damaged ? -RR <p> Took pump and drain hoses off my front loading Affinity washer and cleaned everything out . Taking the upper boot that housed to basket was a real pain . It had some sort of screw spring release clamp . Now that I am trying to put it back on I can not seem to get it tight again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with how taut it makes it . Am I supposed to put caulk in there for adherence ? Also , just an FYI I did put a little laundry soap on inner rim to slip on easier . Any suggestions ? <p> I fixed my washer without taking it apart ! I would have had to take apart the entire washer to fix clogged pump . But instead I 1 ) used EXTREMELY hot water and let it drain a few times , putting the hose on the ground . 2 ) blew air into the hose and back out to help unclog the water pump . 3 ) started to shake and slide the washer back and forth as it was on its drain cycle . 4 ) after doing this for about an hour , THE WATER PUMP STARTED WORKING and a HUGE clump of my rugs lint came out of the machine . <p> My Frigidaire FWS1233FS1 top loader lately has had about 25-30% percent water remaining in the tub after washes . After selecting an additional spin cycle , the water clears . I 've read through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There is no bad smell , no funny/alarming noises . I plan on checking the drain hoses later today , but otherwise , do you think I need to replace the pump ? I am connected to a cesspool , but nothing else in the house has difficulty draining . I 've also recently reset the water pressure to the house because of a water hammer . I 'm not entirely sure if the draining problems occurred before or after this event . Any additional information would be great . Thank you for your attending to all these washer issues ! <p> Alex , You could have a slight clog in the drain pump , drain hose , or actual drain itself . Check most easy first . Check the drain hose for crimps or clogs , then drain pump for foreign objects inside of it , if both are okay , no clogs or blockage , the issue may be in the drain itself . You may need to clean out the drain trap in your home if you have one or have a plumber come and check your situation at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just as good as before you reset the water pressure , then the things we mentioned above are most likely causing your issue . -RR <p> I have checked and taken the pump back off again and then put it back on just to make sure and everything is installed correctly . and the drain pump is n't clogged . I think the drain that is in the house might be clogged a little because the water will overflow but will go back down so I know it is n't clogged completely . Could that be what my problem is ? I thought about that and it would make sense if it was just not draining all the water but could the line being clogged really make it make that sound ? It does n't  always make the grinding , clicking sound and sometimes drains all the water out . It is just a roll of the dice at the moment . <p> Karin , Yes that is part of your issue . If the drain in your home is clogged , then it will back up when the washer is draining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to drain . Get that looked at by a plumber first and then troubleshoot the washer. -RR <p> Model number is WTW4800XQ4 . And the grinding noise will come and go through the whole drain cycle . It is a top loader and I 'm not sure exactly where the noise is coming from . It could be the pump but the motor and everything for it is in about the same spot . It does sound like the pump area though . <p> My whirlpool washer wont get all the water out when it drains . There is a grinding , clicking sound coming from it when it tries to drain . I have already replaced the drain pump so I know it is good and not clogged and I also replaced the clutch . I am at a loss for what could be wrong . <p> Karin , Please tell us the model number of your Whirlpool washer . Is it top load or front load ? Does the grinding noise come from the drain pump ? At what point does the noise occur , during the complete drain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? -RR <p> Help , Washing machine ! Does anyone know if there 's a master reset on these machines , washer works perfect until drain , were it does nothing . Have put new filter in and belt looks okay any advice please ? <p> I have a top load washer Roper washer it is an old washer . I been reading all the comments and some where the same as the problem I have going on . My husband has master reset it and followed steps a to c and my washer will wash my clothes but when its time to drain it on spin cycle the water goes no where . We tried the drain hose taking it apart , unplugging the washer machine , all the above . I do n't  know if this is something we can do our self or do I have to take it in for repair please help . <p> Ms. Slaught , It sounds as if you have examined the drain hose but not the drain pump . If the pump itself is clogged with debris , the washer can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see if the drain pump is clean and in working order ? Check the drain pump and clean it out if necessary . You will need to get into the washer to do this . Do you have a multimeter ? It could also be not receiving the correct power voltage . Please give us the model number of your Roper washer. -RR <p> I have a Samsung front loader and the washer went through the wash cycle but when it got to the drain/spin cycle a code was flashing and the water will not drain . I restarted it on rinse and spin and it would rinse but yet again when it got to spin it stopped . The door is locked , I have unplugged the washer to reset it . What else could be the problem ? <p> Amanda , You most likely have a clog in the drain pump , drain hose , or the drain trap . Make sure the drain hose is not bent . Clean the drain trap . You may need to gain access to the drain pump and see it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the main control board . How old is the washer and what is the model number ? -RR <p> My LG WT1101CW does n't  drain . When I run a spin cycle , I hear a humming but I cant tell if that is the pump attempting to work , or humming from other mechanisms in the machine . When I remove the drain hose from the wall and put it into a bucket , water comes out and I am able to mostly drain the machine ( there is still water that wont come out because the hose ca n't go any lower ) . What do you think the issue could be ? If I need to remove the pump , how would I disconnect the hoses without the remaining water spilling into the body of the washer ? Its only been two days and the smell coming from the machine is *TERRIBLE* , I just want to at least get rid of all the water . Thanks . <p> well i 'm not much of a mr.fixit , for the most part , i took the washer apart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out the back , and there are no clogs , the water is just sitting in the tubes , now nothing has changes with the hoses either the same set up since we moved in. we literally have not touch the washer in the 5 years we been here , i do n't  have a voltage meter . and when i go down to check , no buzzing , not sure how to get it right to " drain " without having it run a full cycle . i also double checked anything that needs to be plugged in , like the harnesses and they seem to be plugged in . <p> Thomas Helms , Try this for a test take the drain hose out from the wall ( leave attached to the washer ) and when the machine comes to drain mode , hold the hose into a bucket and see if it drains . Try this and let us know what happens . We can assist further if you let us know what happens . -RR <p> Have about a 5 year old Roper washing machine , about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the water out , checked all the hoses and no clog , ended up replacing the pump , still not the issue , still not draining ? <p> Thomas Helms , Can you tell us exactly what happens when it gets to the drain cycle ? Does it make noise ? Do you hear anything , water flow , clicking , motor running ? Did you make SURE the drain pump is receiving the correct voltage ? Are all the wire harnesses secure ? Did you make sure the drain is not clogged therefore preventing the washer from pumping out the water ? Have you checked the drain hose to be sure it is positioned correctly and not crimped ? Depending on what model you have , you may have a control board or timer issue . Have you checked to be sure all other components are working properly ? -RR <p> My washing machine is Model No . WF1104XAC . The lights does not come on , and the washer is definitely getting power tried other appliances on the same power outlet . The repair man said it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you say and I am afraid it is the motor . <p> I have a Samsung washing machine , front loader 10 kg . I does not start or anything , I tried different power sockets and nothing works . I had a repair man here saying the motherboard is damaged and it could be the motor too , but he did not know . He never got back to me either about the repair of it . How can I know if the motor is damage and is it worth fixing the motherboard if the problem still will exit , because of the motor might be damaged . <p> Michelle Tommosgard , Is the washer getting power at all ? Do the lights turn on ? You have to be sure the washer is getting power before you begin replacing parts . Did the repairman check the voltage going to the washer ? If the washer has power and nothing works , check the wiring harnesses behind the front panel and also be sure the plug and cord is not damaged . If all wires are secure and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power issue inside the washer . Something may be loose or damaged . Please give us the model number of your Samsung washer. -RR <p> My whirlpool washer stops after agitating &amp; does n't  go to the next cycle , so it remains with a tub of water . Even manually moving the dial to another cycle does n't  work . I thought it was the timer , so I replaced it . It still does not work . Any suggestions ? <p> Marcia , The next part on your top load Whirlpool washer to test and most likely replace will be the lid switch . The lid switch , even if bad , will let the washer agitate but not spin . If the lid switch is good , then next would be to check drain pump and drain hose for blockage . You can find videos of all these issues on YouTube so you can follow along and troubleshoot it yourself . Do you have a multimeter ? If not an inexpensive one to have around the house is a good idea . -RR <p> I have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its cycle at the point where it should be draining .

I have n't been able to find anything I can do to influence its starting up again ( such as turning the machine off and back on , rotating through the dial , or unplugging it . None of the potential issues you listed in your article seem to apply to this problem . Do you have an ideas for me ? <p> Bartelot , Most likely the washers mechanical/electrical timer is faulty . You can find a timer for your washing machine for around $100 dollars online .

Any other ideas what this could be ? <p> Belinda , If you checked the drain pump and drain hose , have you checked the pump pull out filter at bottom of machine ? If you pull the drain hose from the wall and put it in a bucket ( for testing purposes ) does the washer drain ? Did you actually remove and inspect the inside of the drain pump to see if it is indeed clear of debris ? -RR <p> I have a Sears Kenmore washer and the washer will not drain . When I try to put it in the cycle the washer blows a fuse in my electrical box . My dryer is on the same fuse and nothing happens when this is on . Any ideas what to do ? ? ? ? <p> Anne Marie , If the washer is blowing the fuse , there is either something binding up in the washer mechanically causing it to blow the fuse or an electrical component in the washer is grounding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to take the washer apart and troubleshoot what may be causing the issue . You could also just have an issue with the drain pump . Either way , you will need to take apart the washer to find out . -RR <p> My Panasonic washing machine is not draining . it is washing clothes a bit slower than usual and when it is time to drain , it drains a bit then the alarm goes off . pls help . model is : Na-F6086 fuzzy logic . <p> Jean , It sounds like your drain pump is clogged .

Given the expense of a mechanic I am considering buying a new machine now . <p> Kim , It is very possible the control board has an issue . First check the drain hose to be sure the machine is allowed to drain . You replaced the drain pump , was that because the exact same issue was happening ? Did anything change ? Is there a lid switch on your washer model ? -RR <p> My Beko WMA620W will not drain properly . I have removed a blockage ( and checked all hoses to make sure there are no more ) and also replaced the pump . The pump runs , but will not remove water unless I back the filter off slightly . You then hear a swishing sound as if water is flowing into the pump and then it starts to remove water . Any ideas ? <p> Shaun , It is possible that the filter is somehow inserted into the washer to far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fitting that is letting the filter block drainage ? This may be preventing it from draining properly . What does the tubing or hoses look like from the filter to the drain pump ? Possible partial clog ? Since you have checked all components and replaced the drain pump , check all wire harnesses and be sure all is secure . Be sure a part is not missing near the filter . Also check the pressure switch . Here is a page where you can view exploded parts views of your washer in PDF . -RR <p> Thank you for responding . The smell is electrical since there is no belt drive . The only wire harness is secure . The only part number I can find for the machine is 3351736 . The impeller pump part number is 3352492 . It seems free to turn and from what I can see the impeller looks to be in one piece . Its not super easy to spin but its not supposed to be easy . There 's no interference in the plumbing that I can see . The part number on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number next to it of 312J10 . The motor works well because the agitator works really fast . <p> My Whirlpool works fine until its time to drain . I pulled the pump off the motor , the motor turns both ways and the impeller looks good , and it too is free to move . I noticed a buzzing noise when it was time to drain and I smell something hot , like the motor is burning . I unplugged it right away . I cleaned any dust away from the motor and tried it again with the same results . Is there a reverse switch of some kind that reverses the motor to run the de-water pump ? <p> Even though I have not much knowledge about W/M , will do a trial . I would like to know , if there is any switching circuit between control board and motor which activate the pump . Thank you once again for the immediate response . <p> Sangam , The control board is what sends the signal to run the drain pump . You may have a wire issue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Watch this video as it may assist you with your washer drain pump issue . -RR <p> My Samsung WA80V3 Top Loading Automatic Washing Machine works but do not drain . I checked the Motor and Drain Pipes . It seems Motor does not get power . Please help me to sort out this problem . I tested the pump motor with direct A/c supply and found it runs . <p> My washer is not draining I cleand out the trap and I blew through the drain hose and I heard water returning back to the inner tub , l put it on the drain cycle and I hear a grinding noise from the lower part of the washer assumeing that its the pump motor failing any help would be appreciated <p> Richard , The grinding noise is most likely from the drain pump . There may be foreign objects in it causing it to make the grinding noise . Safely access the drain pump and inspect the inside of it for anything that may be trapped inside . -RR <p> Thank you for sharing some tips on how to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the past few weeks and I 'm not exactly sure what to do . Sometimes it does not drain properly and sometimes it just starts and then stops moments later . It is not that old so I would rather get it repaired than buy a new one because that would be very costly ! Like you said , I will check the drain hose and the water pump belt before calling a professional . Thanks again ! <p> my maytag centennial top loader washer stopped the other day with a load of clothes and a tub full of water . checked the lid switch and it works . check my drain hose , nothing stopping it up . control panel works . after a cleaned it out and drained it i looked at the motor belt . no breaks , not loose , and motor turns . there was a humming noise coming from either the pump or the capacitor. unplugged and changed the load to a small delicate load . the load filled with small load of water and the agitator ran . however , when the time came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . i had to once again unplug to get the hum to stop . i did notice when i first looked behind the washer that the hot water inlet had a bad kink in it . the first thing i did was unkink the hose but this apparently had nothing to do with this problem . could there be a jam under the tub that would require removing the agitator and inner tub or is this an electrical or mechanical problem ? there is mention on one site of a rubber connector type seal between the motor and the base that may be bad and need replacing . i have orderd the wrench you need to disconnect the agitator so you can remove the tub to get at the problem if it is there . this is the first time this washer has failed but ran fine prior to this . model number is MVWC200XW2. thank you for your help . <p> Valerie , Sounds as if the drain motor pump is clogged . Get to the drain pump and disassemble the pump and check for foreign objects that may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clogged and the pump is ok , then check the capacitor . Use a multimeter to be sure the capacitor or capacitors are not faulty . If a capacitor is bad then you can order one on Amazon for next to nothing . -RR <p> My Amana front loader showed an error code in the middle of the wash of ND , which I looked up to mean not draining . It is very cold outside and I thought maybe it was backed up due to frozen pipes outside . I disconnected the washer drain pipe to have it just drain into a large plastic tub and unplugged the washer to reset it , but now it does not do anything ( and yes , i plugged it back in : ) ) . There is a very quiet humming sounds . Could it have burned out the motor trying to drain earlier ? A couple hours went by before I noticed the error . <p> Cindy , When you turn the machine on to do a cycle , what is the control panel showing ? Blinking lights , error @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ normal but just hums and nothing happens ?

Water filled up and started washing for 10 mins . It looked fine to me then read error code 4e . So It drained the water I then out it on spin cycle and it took out all the water in my clothes beautifully . Has someone check it says my water pressure was to high , double checked the hose saw , a little debris . Now time to try again . Washed perfectly now it wont spin getting error code 5e ! ! ! <p> I have a Kenmore series 80 washing machine.Sometimes is leaves a small amount of water , bout an inch , in the tub and does n't  spin strong enough to get the water out of clothes . I can hold the button down where the lid closes and do 4-6 , just spin and it will eventually spin normal . It might do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go to several spin cycles for it to work . It does spin , but slower.On several trys it will finally get it right.Once it finally spins fatst the water comes out of clothes . This happens every time no matter how little I have in the machine . <p> Peggy , When this starts to happen on an older Kenmore 80 series washing machine , it is most likely the motor coupler going bad . If the motor coupler is in ok shape , then the machine needs an overhaul . You would need a new basket drive , a new clutch , and maybe a new gearcase . Check the machine and you may find that parts stated above are what is causing your problem . These parts should not cost very much to do it yourself . -RR

These easy maintenance tips will work on all refrigerators including GE , Whirlpool , Kenmore , Samsung , LG , Frigidaire , Maytag , and more . <p> Tip 1:Set The Refrigerator On The Best Temperature Setting <p> Setting the fridge temperature too low ( extra cold ) will make your refrigerator work harder to keep the temp setting . This can result in the refrigerator not lasting as long as designed . By setting the fridge or freezer temperature at a warmer setting , you will not only save money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When you turn the refrigerator setting dial to be very cold , you are adding extra running time on your fridge compressor . This can result in a failed compressor and that usually means a new- refrigerator is needed . Set the temperature of your freezer and fridge at a reasonably warmer setting . 37 degrees is the perfect temperature setting in the fridge to save money in electric bills , keep your food at a the perfect temperature , and make the compressor run less . <p> Best Refrigerator Temperature Settings <p> Tip 2:Maintain Clean Condenser Coils <p> This is one of the main reasons refrigerators fail to cool properly . When the coils get covered in dust or other debris , this prevents the efficiency of the refrigerators ability to cool . This makes the compressor run extremely hot . This usually results in the compressor failing early . The condenser coils on your refrigerator are on the back or sometimes the bottom . To keep the fridge running as designed , use a hand wand vacuum and vacuum off all of the pet hair and dust that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You can also use an air compressor to blow the dust and dirt off . If you do this regularly ( every 6 months ) , you will most likely never have problems with your fridge not cooling properly .

Cleaning the condenser coils will keep your fridge running smooth for years to come . ( Be sure to unplug the refrigerator when cleaning the coils for safety reasons ) <p> Condenser Coil Location on your Refrigerator <p> Tip 3:Keep The Freezer Completely Full <p> Efficiency is key when dealing with your freezer . By keeping it completely full with frozen foods , the better the freezer will keep the temperature . The less air in the freezer the better . This leads to the freezer keeping cooler and less energy run time on the freezer . This means it will run less and keep items perfectly frozen . <p> FREEZER EFFICIENCY TIP : If you do not have tons of food to keep in your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to fill up space .

By keeping bottles of frozen water in your freezer , it creates less space resulting in your freezer not having to run as long therefore saving electricity and- longevity of your freezer . <p> Tip 4:Do Not Keep The Refrigerator Doors Open <p> When you open the refrigerator or freezer door , the outside warm air flows in and the cold refrigerator or freezer air gets out . Be- conscious of how long you have the door open . If your refrigerator is messy and disorganized , find the time to put things in there place so you wont have to keep the fridge door open for a long time .

Anything hot or warm you put in the refrigerator will add warm air into the fridge and add run time to the compressor . <p> General refrigerator maintenance and cleaning <p> BONUS REFRIGERATOR MAINTENANCE TIP:Keep the door seals or door gaskets clean . If there is debris or food on the door seal , cold air can escape . Check your door gaskets regularly for cracks or tears . If you find cracks or tears , remove and replace the door gasket to prevent cold air from seeping out from your fridge . <p> BONUS MONEY SAVING TIP:An old ( 15 or so years old ) refrigerator can use 3 or 4 times more electricity then the new efficient refrigerators manufactured today .

If your washing machine fills with water but then stops , here is the best tip to fix it fast . If you have a top loading washer , the MOST likely part to have failed is the LID SWITCH . Before anything make sure that you have the lid shut . The machine will not run if the lid is open . This is a safety feature so the machine will not agitate with the lid in the open position .

Took a leap of faith and ordered and installed a new timer switch and the same problem persists , namely all the fill and rinse spin cycles work fine , but machine goes quiet ( with the timer motor running ) after a fill and does not agitate ( even with the lid switch shorted although this model let 's you add clothes during agitate ) .

Then also stopped the machine after a fill was completed while waiting for the agitate that never happens and ran a continuity test on the new switch . Discovered that the blue wire ( P21 ) was now connected to the yellow wire ( P14 ) but to nothing returning it to the black or gray side and now the red ( P17 ) was connected to the white/black ( P13 ) . Noticed that the violet wire ( P6 ) ( from the fill switch was now connected to the black wire ( P1 ) ) and was connected to P23 ) , but which was not closed by the timer switch to ( P22 ) so no connection to the blue wire was made . Then I " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and reconnected the timer switch to see if the machine would agitate and it did so very vigorously . This jumper does not let the machine fill with water before starting to agitate , but instead fills concurrently and is not desirable . I can not understand why it appears that the switch does not supply power during agitate to the blue wire by closing the first switch or other possibly 2nd to ( P20 ) to blue ( P21 ) . <p> I need to have the new timer provide power to the motor during agitate without having to provide any external jumpers . When I ohmed the motor it appeared to check good . Sorry this was so long winded , but I do not have a schematic of the washer . <p> I hear it is very good to try to keep these " old " machines running , because the new machines with all their electronics are much less reliable . <p> Have a KAWE760wal3 Kitchenaid 3-speed washer ( made exactly like a Whirlpool of same vintage ) .

There 's also a burning smell coming from the washer . Please help . Thanks . <p> David , Most likely the timer motor assembly needs replaced .

Thanks for your help . <p> Tammy , Sounds like you have a top load washer . If the washer fills with water and then DOES NOTHING , this means you have a bent , bad , or loose lid switch . When the washing machine lid comes down it makes contact with a small switch which let 's the washer run . Check the lid switch . -RR <p> I have a whirlpool top loader that is not filling with water hot or cold . I have replaced the water inlet valve an still no water .

A thorough investigation revealed a large ugly mold fungus infection on the wall near the top of the ceiling and around the window . Should we start treatment with a biocide product or is that safe ? How do we go permanently get rid of this horrible mold problem ? <p> Answer : You should of course find the reason the window leaks as this is the likely cause of the mold being in that area . The leaky window seal makes the area wet and this is the reason for the mold in that exact area . First try to scrap the mold into a garbage bag while you wear a mask to filter the spores .

Mold is an organism which is neither plant nor animal . They are part of the fungi family . Unlike normal plants mold does not get energy from the sun through photosynthesis . The suns ultraviolet light inhibits all mold growth . Mold eats the material they are growing on . The role of mold is to break down decaying organic matter such as dead plants , leaves or dead animals . Sometimes because of conditions in your home such as moisture , mold will grow easily .

From our experience with different types of mobile phones on different networks including AT&amp;T , T-Mobile , and Verizon , it is mostly never your phone that is the problem .

I have it plugged into the USB port on my laptop and it wo n't take a charge .

If you have an iPhone , buy an original Apple charge cord and the same for Android phones . <h> Object Plugging Port or Cable <p> Charging cords are usually shoved in purses and spend lots of time on the floor . Small particles of dirt and lint can get stuck in the ends of the charging cables . Have a look while the cord is unplugged and see if you can find anything that may be blocking the ends .

Once the battery is removed use a non metal object like a toothpick or similar and try bending the small metal flap or tab to be perfectly horizontal . The tiny metal tab can get bent if you try and plug the power cord in upside down or if something is stuck in the port .

@@13196862 @1796862/ <p> Dryer not heating ? If your old or new front or top loading dryer is all of a sudden not drying your clothes , then we have a few simple DIY fix tips you can try yourself . If the dryer is no longer drying your clothes then the first thing to do is to check and clean the dryer lint filter trap . We were forced to add that as our first step as there really are some people who do not realize there is a LINT FILTER that must be cleaned before or after each use . Once that is cleaned out , check if the dryer is still NOT drying your clothes . If that was NOT the cause of the problem , then you will need to inspect the vent hose on the back of the dryer . Commonly this HOT AIR VENT HOSE will become clogged , caked or full of lint that is constantly being removed from your clothing when drying . When this happens your dryer is unable to expel the hot air from within , therefore making it impossible for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manner or at all . <p> If your clothes dryer is taking forever to dry your clothes or it is not drying your clothing at all ( and you already thoroughly cleaned the lint filter screen ) , then the first step is to CLEAN OUT THE INSIDE OF THE DRYER VENT HOSE . First , unplug your dryer from the electrical socket on the wall . Slide the dryer forward very carefully so you can get behind it . Locate the ( usually silver colored ) air vent hose , and remove it from the wall and the dryer ( 2 connection points ) . Do this by squeezing the clip at both ends and pulling the hose outward . Using a long dryer vent brush or similar , clean out the inside of the air vent hose by removing all of the built up lint and dust looking material . Clean the area on the back of the dryer and the hole in the wall where the air is vented out . Most of the time the lint will be built up in both of these areas . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the vent hose and slide the dryer back in place . Make sure you DO NOT KINK the vent hose when repositioning the dryer as this will cause the dryer to NOT expel the hot air properly . If you kink the hose the dryer will not function properly and your clothes will take forever to dry . Next , plug the dryer back into the power outlet and run a test . If your dryer is now heating and properly drying your clothes then you fixed the problem . If not , read on <p> At times your dryer can overheat and this can cause the motor that turns the drum to stop working temporarily . There is a safety mechanism built into the motor that makes it stop working if it gets too hot . This is called a thermally protected motor . Your dryer may seem to be running but the motor will not be turning the drum . If the drum is not turning then the clothes are not moving . Therefore they can not get DRY . So if your dryer motor is NOT turning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the lights and other mechanical parts , then your motor is probably overheated . For this , you need to just give the motor some time to cool down . If you suspect that this is your problem then give the dryer about an hour to cool down and run a test after that . If your motor has overheated then you may be overloading your dryer with too many clothes . Try running the dryer with less clothes in it the next time you dry a load and this should remedy the issue . <p> The solutions above are the most common causes for this specific malfunction . If the explanations above have not been your specific problem , then there can be a number of things wrong . If you feel comfortable you can remove the front panel of your dryer ( while unplugged ) and look to see if there are any obvious causes of the problem . A possible loose wire , loose part , burnt area , pieces of the dryer that have come off , fried or burned mechanical switches , etc . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know what the issue can be , we recommend going here and posting a question to online appliance repair technicians . If all else fails then simply leave a comment or question below and we PROMISE to answer your question in a timely manner . <p> Other components that could be at fault would be the Thermal fuse , Thermal cutoff , Heating element , Operating thermostat , and High limit thermostat . You can check all of these for continuity with a multimeter .

I checked the lint vent piping exhaust pipe and it had some accumulation of lint on the sides but was not obstructed in any serious way . This is model 110.76912693 . Would the thermal fuse go just due to old age or does it have to have an overheating situation to blow it . We always empty the lint filter after each use . I looked on the owners manual and it seems like I would have to remove the entire two back panels to access the fuse so I did n't  bother . If it is not the fuse , is the next option the thermostat ?

Now , when I initially begin to use the dryer , the lighter coil ( not sure if that 's what its called ) will heat to a glow , then it ignites the gas and the flame flows and heat is generated , and everything works great .

If the LG dryer spins but does not heat , then the best possible reason for this is the wiring is incorrect .

The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will need to be taken apart and looked at . Unplug the dryer and have a look at the door assembly switch . It may be fried and causing the dryer to run when the door is shut . You may also have issues with the main control board . Check for burn marks , loose connections , etc Let us know what you find . -RR <p> I have a 1979 Maytag DG410 gas dryer that I am ( stubbornly ) reluctant to replace because it has n't  completely given up the ghost and were on a tight budget . Heres what it does : If I run it after it has been sitting for a few days I can usually get it to dry one load if the " delicate " button is pushed rather than " regular " and if I use it on " more dry " rather than the timed or the permanent press options . When I push " start " the igniter glows white hot and there is an audible click and then the gas ignites . The problem is , after the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ igniter is no longer able to ignite the gas . You can hear the click where its trying to but its as if the gas is n't being released ( or at least not making contact ) even though it was earlier in the cycle . So naturally at this point the cycle becomes nothing more than air fluff and clothes remain damp . I realize this is a very old dryer and its only still kicking because I 've already replaced the igniter , a belt and some drum related part ( cant remember which one ) . My husband thinks this is unlikely but is there anyway there could be a partial obstruction on the gas line ? And if so , who does one call for help with that ? Our local gas company ? <p> Hi we bought a used Estate by Whirlpool heavy duty super capacity electric dryer and it tumbles , heats up ( inside feels hot outside feels warm ) but my clothes are taking six hours to dry . Theyre warm to touch but still just super wet . The lint trap is clean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ condo that vents it out through the roof . Before my husband goes and buys parts . Is it most likely the vent going out since everything heats up and tumbles ? <p> Megan , Yes , if your Whirlpool dryer is actually heating ( and set on HIGH heat ) but the clothes are taking forever to dry , then yes there is most likely a clog of lint or another blockage . If the air is vented through and up to the roof , the issue could be at roof level . Have the condo HOA association get someone to go and check to see if the clog is actually at the roof level . The clog or blockage could be in the venting duct going from somewhere in between the wall ( behind the dryer ) and up and to the roof opening . Let us know what you find . -RR <p> I have a Kenmore 27 ? electric dryer , model #110.63014101 . It takes longer than normal to dry a load . There appears to be heat as the clothes are warm , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and exhaust parts which did have a fair bit lint packed in , but it still does not heat sufficiently . I am handy and can replace parts if I know which ones to replace . I have the manual with all the part numbers , so can order the correct parts . I do n't  have a multimeter however . <p> My question is : what is the most likely issue here ? Heating element ? High limit thermostat ? Cycling thermostat ? Temperature sensor ? The machine otherwise runs the same as before , so I assume it is not thermal fuse(s) . <p> Hello , My Indesit PWDE 7124S washer dryer machine taking too much time to dry clothes . Looks like the upper panel is getting warm when machine is at dry program , but clothes are not getting hot . Can you help me where to check if there are some stuff blocking air ? Thanks . <p> The exhaust hose is n't blocked , I replaced the thermal fuse and the thermostat and my dryer is still not getting hot . Sometimes it works and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new thermostat says it was for 240v and my original one said 120v could that be a problem ? What about those two other little electrical parts going to the vertical box they at some other kind of sensor things ? <p> My whirlpool dryer is twenty years old but is in great condition . Recently , it decided to stop heating when running . The instruction manual does not label any of the parts on the back of the dryer . We have determined that there is no continuity on the part on the upper back of the dryer but were not sure what it is . Can you help please ? <p> Sherry , You most likely have a bad thermal fuse . The thermal fuse is used on a dryer as a safety fuse for overheat . Check this page here to see if this is what you are experiencing with your dryer Dryer not heating Thermal Fuse . -RR <p> I have a front loading Electrolux dryer Electrolux EIMGD55IIW 8.0 Cu . Ft . Gas Front Load Dryer with IQ-Touch Controls featuring Perfect Steam It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dry thoroughly anymore , especially since the weather turned colder . I checked the vent and cleaned it up to the roof . Actually stuck a leaf blower up the pipe to blow it all out . It did not seem to help . Any suggestions . <p> I have a 5 year old Samsung Front Loading Electric Dryer . I 've cleaned out vent hose and inside the dryer of all lint . I actually changed out the rear vent . The dryer heats up just fine but it seems that there is water build up in the vent hose . The clothes are moist and will not dry all the way and stays on for 3+ hoursIt seems like my dryer is working fine because it heats up and tumbles just fine . Is there something else that is not within the dryer I should be looking at ? Is moisture coming back into the dryer somehow ? I am at a loss . Should I try the exterior vent ? Please help <p> Pete , If moisture is getting back into the vent hose from your Samsung dryer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not working properly . If the clothing takes forever to dry , you may have a thermostat , heating element , or control board issue . If you know for sure that all the dryer venting lines are 100% clear , then the problem is within your Samsung dryer . Use a multimeter and test all components to be sure everything is working as designed . -RR <p> Lori Laverone , Is your Whirlpool dryer heating at all ? If no heat whatsoever , check the thermal fuse on back . If you get some heat , it may be a lint issue in the wall , lint in the dryer itself or a thermostat issue . Try some further troubleshooting and see what you can find . -RR <p> My Samsung dryer appeared to be running fine , but after drying a load of laundry , it lost power . The unit will not turn on . It is about 4-1/2 years old and I have not had issues with it in the past . Outside of a paying a pricey repair bill , any ideas ? I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and reset all the GFIs that could be in the same circuit to no avail . <p> Watkins , Is the complete dryer without power or will it just NOT HEAT ? If you have NO power at all and the breaker is ON , then have a look at the back of the dryer to be sure the terminal and wires are intact . Could also be an issue with the plug or cord from wall to dryer . Have you opened up the dryer with it unplugged to see if you find any obvious signs of an issue ? What model number is your Samsung dryer ? -RR <p> Have a Maytag gas dryer replaced both coil valves and brand-new vent from the back of the dryer to the outside of the house cleaned and cleared everything of lint dryer will not heat up and dry it will glow and ignite but not stay on long enough to dry clothes . The lint trap and inside the dryer everything was cleared of Lint if we vent it into the laundry room it gets hot and will dry clothes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you <p> Duet Gas Dryer ( Mod . GGW9260PW0 ) will not ignite flame after initial start up . The dryer will ignite flame when cycle starts , but when it calls for heat after the initial lighting , the igniter glows but the flame does not return . It will continue running the cycle as if all is normal , but the flame will not light when called for after the first lighting at the beginning of the cycle . <p> John Glenn , This problem is most likely the igniter the thing that glows . That is what provides the resistance to provide the current for the coils to open in your gas valve . It is a $30 dollar fix and can be done with minimal effort . -RR <p> I have a GE DBVH512 and it was shutting off after 3 minute when running on high . After 5 minutes the power comes back on and it was running fine . It runs fine on medium heat . I checked the lint filter , piping , and hose and there was no blockage . I also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do it . I even vacuumed out the inside ( including the motor ) . There were no error codes when I tried to pull them . Had a professional come out and went through the same process of cleaning and found a large amount of lint on the vent on top of the roof . He ran it empty and it ran fine , but when we put cloths in later we had the same problem ( my wife suggested running it with cloths in it when he was here , but he told her that this would n't make a difference . On the return trip , they replaced the thermostat and said if that does n't  solve the problem ; we may want to replace the control board . Now the dryer is shutting off twice when running it on the high cycle . They want $300.00 for the board . Any suggestions ? <p> Phillip Breunig , If the venting system is clean of lint Then you may have an issue with a number of things . Does the dryer still turn but just will not heat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out ? -RR <p> kenneth patrick samek , Most likely the dryer power is on 2 breakers and one is off . Possibly 2 120V breakers are connected to the dryer and one is turned off meaning the dryer has the power to spin and turn , but not to heat . The dryer needs 120V to spin and 120V to heat . CHECK THE BREAKER BOX OR FUSE BOX . Let us know what you find . -RR <p> Hi , I just replaced the blower wheel on my stacked maytag dryer . Put the front back on and ran the dryer for about 5 seconds heard a pop , saw a spark and burnt smell . No power now with no sound of the motor running any ideas what to do ? <p> Eric , Not to imply you did anything wrong , but if it shorted out the moment power was applied , something was wired wrong or a wire may have been touching the side of the dryer . Did the breaker reset ? Is the dryer plug burnt ? Where is the damage ? Inside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . -RR <p> I have a Maytag dryer that 's not quite 2 years old and my dryer vent was cleaned out about 2 years ago . It seems like all my clothes need to go through a 2 drying cycles before they are dry . Could that really be the dryer vent causing this issue or are there other things to look for like a bad sensor ? <p> Matt Pisani , Yes the vent hose is most likely clogged with lint . If the vent hose or in the dryer or wall , there is lint build-up , the dryer can not expel the hot air and therefore will take longer to dry your clothes . Try cleaning all the venting areas and that should solve your issue . If not let us know . -RR <p> Hello I have a Frigidaire dryer , it says affinity on the front along with wrinkle release technology , my problem is the dryer is spinning but no heat , I unplugged it and pulled it out and took the hose off and looked in it but did n't  see any lint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ load . What else could be wrong with it ! Thank you <p> Tanya , Test the thermal fuse at back with a meter to be sure it is not blown . As long as you have cleaned the vent hose , lint trap , and the wall is clear of lint , the next most likely problem is the fuse . If the fuse is okay then it may be a thermostat or a board issue . Check thermal fuse first . -RR <p> Just want to take a moment to thank the folks maintaining and contributing to this site . It has an incredible amount of useful information . I had trouble with my dryer not drying the clothes fully and I found this site googling for the problem . Thankfully my issue was fixed at step 2 by clearing the air vent hose . But I was curious and read all the next steps just in case I needed to work on any of those . I found that the instructions were explained in a simple and concise manner which was very helpful for a novice like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is displaying error codes PF/AF . I have checked the lint screen , cleared the vent hose all the way to the outside . It also intermittently jumps time on the countdown timer . Went from 45 minutes to 5 minutes in just under 10 . <p> Patrick , Whirlpool Cabrio Dryer PF error code = Power Failure = PF flashes to indicate that a power failure occurred while the dryer was running . Press START to continue the cycle , or press PAUSE/CANCEL to clear the display.Whirlpool Cabrio Dryer AF error code = Restricted Airflow Condition = AF flashes if a restricted airflow condition exists . Check to make sure the lint screen is clean , the door seal is in place and the vent is not obstructed . <p> If the timer is malfunctioning , check the board for any issues such as burn or scorch marks . If you reset the dryer , does the error code reset ? -RR <p> I have a Samsung Dryer dv218agw/xaa . The dryer works on medium heat , but it barley heats up when the high heat setting is selected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Do you have an idea about what might causing this and how to fix it . <p> Paul , The switch that controls the heat temp could be faulty . There may be a wiring issue . Unplug the dryer and have a look in the control panel for wiring issue . You may also have a bad thermostat or other related part . Here is a parts guide to your Samsung Dryer DV218AGW. -RR <p> Hily , If you have 2 dryers , are they both hooked to the same vent ? Check the wall or vent hoses to be sure you do not have a lint blockage . If you have 2 dryers that both will spin but they both stopped heating at the same time , it is most likely the vent is clogged , or possibly you lost part of the power . Are the dryers electric ? Are they both on the same circuit breaker ? Possible that there are 2 breakers and one has flipped into the off position ? -RR <p> I have a whirlpool dryer that is not drying my clothes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but it takes sometimes days at a time to get a load of laundry dry . I do clean the filter all the time , so I do n't  really know what the problem is . Anyone have any idea what it could be ? <p> Heather , If the dryer spins and HEATS , then you most likely have lint blockage behind the dryer . Clean out the vent hose and the wall . Heavy lint buildup will not allow the hot air to escape , therefore your clothes take forever to dry . -RR <p> I have a Maytag dependable care quiet plus Itelli dry gas dryer . A few months ago it would only ignite on the regular setting . Would not ignite on the time dry or the permanent press setting . So I just used the regular setting the last few months . Now Its not igniting on that setting either . Any thoughts please and thank you . <p> Sylvia , Can you look in and see if the igniter is glowing red ? If you DO see it glowing red and then it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a weak solenoid coil or coils . <p> If you DO NOT see any red glow , the failure could be one of the following parts : Timer , Hi-limit thermostat , Operating thermostat , Thermal fuse , Igniter , Motor centrifugal switch , or Flame sensor . Let us know what you find . -RR <p> We have an electric dryer we 've used for the past 15 years or so . Just recently it stopped heating , but everything else seemed to be working . It will tumble dry , but it takes 3 hours . We 've used an ohm meter to check all the thermostats and fuses and found only one faulty , so we replaced it . We also replaced the heating element to find out our old one was actually working ( it was tested at the parts store ) . Our dryer is still not heating . Is there something else we could check ? The dryer runs well in every other aspect . We can not understand why the dryer is not getting hot . Any help would be greatly appreciated . Thanks in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ working , and you are sure the thermal fuse at back is not blown , then you may have a wiring issue or the control board or timer is not working properly . Have you checked to see if you are getting the proper power to the heating element ? Have you made sure that the dryer is not set up on a 2 breaker system and one is switched off since the dryer is most likely 220V ? Have you checked the plug going into the wall to be sure the wiring is tight and secure ? Have you checked the wiring coming into the dryer ? Checked the terminals ? Made sure the wiring inside the dryer is not damaged or loose ? If you have the proper power to the dryer , then either a part is bad , or there is a wiring issue in the dryer or on a component . -RR <p> I am renting and we were furnished with a dryer that gets hot but takes to long to dry clothes i ran my brush down the roof vent and got the lint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It blows out hot air from the back when the hose is off but when reattached i can.t feel any air flow out the roof vent i also found that the vent coming out of the wall was not attached correctly to the 90 going up the wall and the wall have lint built up inside them i havent opened up the wall yet to get to all the lint but i did fix the tube but still not getting air to the roof vent . The dryer is an electric Estate Model #TEDS 780. jQO <p> I have a Whirlpool Dryer , it gets hot but its not drying the clothes . I cleaned out the vent from the back and also the filter . Is it the heating element ? ? I 'm trying to do it myself .. PLEASE HELP ! ! ! ! ! <p> Jeanna , We are not sure the model number of your Whirlpool dryer , but is it possible you have inadvertently switched the dryer to low heat ? Check the temp settings to be sure . If you have cleaned all lint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you may have a blown thermal fuse . Test with a meter if you have one . You can try taking the vent hose off when running the dryer and see if hot air is blowing out of the dryer . That is a way to test to see if you have some lint build up in the wall where the vent hose hooks into . If you feel hot air coming directly out of the back of the dryer , then your problem is lint build up in the wall . -RR <p> Lois , If your dryer is turning but NOT HEATING and the heating elements and thermostats are in working order , you most likely have a blown thermal fuse . Have you checked it with a meter ? Also check the electrical connections at the back of the dryer to be sure it is getting the correct voltage/power. -RR <p> My 14 year old Whirlpool Duet gas dryer was running , but not heating . I went to the local home improvement stores and found the best price on the same , but newer , model @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . With two days to go before delivery , I was wondering if there was something easy and less expensive that I could do to fix my old dryer . So I sat down with my tablet and searched the Internet for how to sites that may give me some guidance on my model number dryer . After viewing some of the videos , I decided to give it a shot . I unplugged the dryer and removed the front service panel below the dryer door . The space was filled with 14 years of lint that had escaped around the lint trap . I cleaned the accumulation of lint and plugged the dryer back in . With the service panel still removed , I turned the dryer on . I watched as the igniter began to glow and moved out of the direct line of the combustion chamber . After a few moments , the gas valves opened , the igniter did its job and there was a steady burning flame in the combustion chamber . The dryer was heating . After replacing the service panel and starting the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the accumulation of lint was n't letting enough air in to establish a good fuel air ratio for proper combustion . Time to go cancel my purchase and have nearly $800.00 dollars credited back to my credit card . And to set an automatic annual reminder on my phone calendar to clean out the lint behind the service panel . I 'll get a new dryer vent hose as a present for my dryer as a thank you gift for saving me some money . <p> I have a whirlpool duet sport dryer . Would spin but no heat . Clean all the pipes out , put new pipes from dryer to pipe going out side , still no heat . Had the fuse , and heat element replace , still nothing . My repair man told me to replace cord with a new one . I did that . Colors match up like they are suppose to . Now no power at all . Replaced outlet still no power ? ? Any ideas ? ? Desperate ! Only five years old ? ? <p> Kevin , The no heat issue is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But that was your earlier issue Now no power ? If you had power , replaced the cord , and now NO power , then obviously something was wired incorrectly . Check breaker , check terminal strip , check cord to plug , check that cord is not faulty . -RR <p> I 've got an Amana gas dryer , front loading that will heat intermittently . Its about 12 years old . It will usually start up and heat as it should . Then mid cycle when we open the door to take out shirts , it will not heat again , but it will spin . I 've cleaned out the lint trap as this seems the most common issue , but it did not solve the problem . I can watch the igniter glow , but it will not heat . Since it does heat sometimes , I would assume the gas valves are working properly . Any ideas what I should look at next . <p> Pam , Then it must be with the dryer itself . If it has NO POWER then a fuse or something may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or similar . The switch/control panel may be bad therefore not lighting up and seeming to not get power . What is model number of your dryer ? -RR <p> Rosa , If the ducts are clear , have you cleaned lint filter ? If so , make sure controls are set for high heat . If all is well , then there may be an issue in the dryer . Have you checked thermal fuse ? Breaker ? Plug for damage ? Outlet ? -RR <p> Hi , I 'm very excited to find this site ! Thanks for the helpful tips . I hope you can answer a question that I have n't been able to figure out online . I have a front loading electric Samsung dryer . I replaced the silver vent hose on the back of the dryer just a few months ago , as well as the heating element that had burned apart in one spot . My lint trap is collecting lint in a smaller and smaller area on the trap . I know that the hose is new , and we cleaned all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when we replaced the vent hose . Do you have any ideas what the problem might be ? Towels do n't  dry through on a timed cycle , by the way . I have to dry them twice . Thanks again for all the helpful tips ! <p> Clueless , There may be lint build up in the inner walls of the dryer therefore causing the lint to only accumulate onto one small area of the lint trap filter . Try using a shop-vac type vacuum with a wand attachment and suck out all the lint under where the lint trap sits . Also , did you have this issue BEFORE you replaced the silver vent hose ? Be sure it is not kinked behind the dryer which would restrict air flow . -RR <p> Both dryer and washer use 120v . Old dryer is GE will make buzz sound but wont start . Washer also GE but works on same electrical outlet . New Samsung DV350AE came with the new cord . It is digital so lights inside and the panel illuminates and same result as with the old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sound but it wont start . Breaker was never tripped before or since . Lint exhaust is clean , what could it be ? That gas but nothing has change ? <p> Carlos , Usually the buzzing noise means a bad motor or that the door is not fully closing the switch . However , if both dryers are doing the same thing and the washer can run off the same outlet , then you must have an electrical issue . It could also be a gas issue . Consult the manual or call Samsung to be sure . You may want to have an electrician have a look at your wiring and test everything . Does the outlet have a ground ? -RR <p> I have a gas dryer it has share the same outlet as the washing machine . One day the dryer will make a buzz sound and it would not start I plugged the dryer where the washing machine was plugged but same thing happened , the washing machine however worked on both outlets . No fuse tripped I checked twice . I cleaned the lint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I troubleshot manually turned the drum and it started working . I did n't  want to bother with opening and figure out what 's wrong with the dryer so I bought a new one a Samsung and just my luck all the lights are on I press start and just when is about to kick in it stops it wont start . Same issue as the old one so what could be wrong I figure now is not a dryer issue ? Could it be the electric outlet ? How so if the washer works fine ? The gas line ? Tube is almost new . HELP PLEASE . <p> Carlos , If the washer and dryer use the same voltage , then the electrical outlet is most likely not the issue . Possibly the cord ? Did your new Samsung dryer come with its own electrical cord or did you take the one off of the old dryer and put it on the new dryer ? What voltage does the washer and dryer use ? Does the new dryer make the same type of buzzing noise as the older dryer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Did it ever trip the breaker when using the dryer ( old or new ) ? What brand and model number is your washer and dryer ? We can look into this further , just let us know so we can research the exact washer and dryer you own . -RR <p> John Cornwell , What brand and model number dryer do you have ? You may have a bad control panel or wiring problem . Both the no drum turning and no heat at the same time are too much of a coincidence to be separate issues . Open the control panel and check for loose or unsecure wiring . -RR <p> My husband " helped " do laundry this weekend and when I went to take the clothes out of the dryer the machine was overstuffed and of course nothing was dry and the lint filter was completely full of lint and dog hair . I broke the massive load into smaller loads , cleaned the filter and tried to dry them , but the dryer tumbles but no longer heats up . Where do you suggest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dryer model RED4440VQ1 . Thank you for your help . <p> Karen , More than likely the dryer overheated with so many clothes in it . The dryer has a thermal fuse which will blow if it senses overheat . We would recommend to check the thermal fuse on the back of your dryer with a multimeter . This is most probable when a dryer is overloaded and the heat can not escape as efficiently as when a dryer is not overloaded . <p> You could also have some massive lint buildup that is blocking the vents , especially with new clothes being dried for the first time as all the extra lint comes off at once . Also be sure your temp controls were not accidentally bumped and set to low or zero heat . -RR <p> Just wanted to say I found the problem with the Kenmore dryer that we bought used . ( mentioned in the post above ) There were no clogs ( trust me we took everything apart and checked because everything we read said it must be a clog ) , but it still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of the air duct , none at all ) It turns out on this model there is a metal piece that holds the BLOWER WHEEL in place , it came loose and that 's why we werent getting any air . We were able to repair it without even buying a part , but if it does need replaced we found them for $20-$40 ( not bad at all in my opinion ) . If you think this may be your problem , you can search on YouTube and find out where the blower wheel is and how to fix it . Just wanted to post this for anyone who is looking for answers and unable to find them ! <p> Where do I purchase a heating element ? I think that 's what 's wrong with my dryer . It takes up to 7 times to dry 1 load of clothes . Lent trap is spotless and changed damn near every single time . Do n't  want to scrap , trying to fix it because I cant afford a new dryer right now . Let alone my stupid washer issues on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrong with my dryer ? <p> Courtney , Can you tell us your dryer make and model ? You may just need a thermal fuse . Also , go to our washing machine repair question page and ask your question there for us to assist in helping you with your washer. -RR <p> I have a crazy one for you ! Admiral-W10185972 . Would not start , heard buzzing sound . Replaced motor thinking may be bad motor switch , same buzzing result . Checked door switch , thermal fuse , thermostats , coil , wiring with meter , all OK . Took dryer to neighbors and plugged in , started and worked fine , returned back to condo and same buzzing symptom . Checked power at breaker , wall plug , back of dryer and meter showed 120 or so on each red and black leg with white neutral . Checked both legs together and meter showed 220 or so .

How do we troubleshoot for that ? <p> Crista , If the dryer is getting extremely hot , how are the clothes not drying ? Can you explain further ? How old is the dryer ? You bought it used ? When you say " hardly any air comes out " , where are you talking about ? Also , what is the model number of your Kenmore Dryer ? -RR <p> My Whirlpool gas dryer WGD8300SW0 is not working . It started with just sensing and nothing else . drum would not turn or start .

Power works I hit start I get 3 beeps and the interior light in dryer stays continuously on . As best I can tell the door switch can only connect to one set of wires so I do n't  think I have it holed wrong but I am not sure or could it be a short in a wire ? ? If so , can something like this be repaired ? How can I go about testing the wires ? Thank you for your assistance . <p> I have a 6yo electric Samsung dryer , model DV218aew/xaa that stopped heating . I 've replaced the heating element , the fuse and the thermostat , as well as shop-vac the vent hose , all to no avail . All of the original parts were working fine , according to the multimeter .

I am baffled as to what to look at next . <p> I have a dryer that is about 5 years old . The heat runs on it full blast for about 2-3 minutes and then it cools down and runs basically on " air fluff " mode . I have taken the dryer apart and cleaned all areas and checked all traps and lines out of the back . Any ideas ? <p> I have a GE front load gas dryer model DCVH515GWW . My dryer will not heat up , my clothes are not getting dry . I cleaned out the vent from lint . I 'm not sure how to take the back off of dryer and check the thermostat . <p> Sandy , The vent behind your dryer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moisture that is in your clothing can not escape . Check your vent by removing the vent hose on the back of your dryer and be sure the hose or area in wall is not clogged . Unplug the dryer before doing any troubleshooting . If your vent is not clogged let us know and we can assist to troubleshoot further . -RR <p> Dee , You may have an issue with the timer motor . This attached to the knob you turn to change settings . The timer is what controls the heat to the elements . If there is a bad spot on the timer , then the issue you are describing will occur . You can test it with a meter to be sure . -RR <p> Chris , You may have a mass of lint in the dryer vent hose or in the wall . Be sure all this is clean so air can flow . If this is not the issue , you may have an issue with the thermal fuse , thermostats , wiring , or the elements . All of these parts can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in working order . Also , be sure the controls on the dryer are set to high heat . Experiment and change a few settings and see if it starts to heat . -RR <p> well the dryer worked for about 6 loads and died . no power now . i 'm going to take the back off one more time and see what 's what if its simple i 'll fix it if not then its scrap metal . and the washer is fine I took three loads today to the Laundromat and the dryers dried them fine . <p> There is heat , its on high and the dryer is on one breaker . I have replaced parts 3977767 Thermostat , 3977393 thermal cut off , 3387134 Thermostat InternalGBias , 3392519 Thermal Fuse and the dryer is going on 2hrs drying a load of jeans . The dryer is clean and lint free , the exhaust is short and unblocked and working well . The clothes are hot when you open the door like they should be but the clothes are still damp and it is tumbling .. any clues ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HOT after 2 hours of drying but still damp , then your washing machine may not fully be draining and spinning properly leaving your clothes still full of water . This may or not be the case but we need to mention it as 2 hours in a dryer that heats and clothing is HOT indicates washer may not be spinning long enough to get water out of your clothing . Be sure your washer is working properly , if it is Does your dryer have multiple elements ? Have you tested them with a meter ? Could there possibly be an issue with the dryer only turning heat on only at certain times indicating a control panel or board issue ? Have you tested to be sure the dryer is constantly heating the complete 2 hours ? -RR <p> My kenmore 11066662501 electric dryer burned heating element twice . I changed it both times and also decided to change all thermostats and put a new exhaust hose . My dryer runs fine but does not cycle off the heating element on time dry until it gets to 20 or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off and on fine . If I put it on 60 min time and have no clothes in it it cycles off after a couple minutes . Is this ok ? I thought it should cycle off even with wet clothes in it before waiting until there is only 20-25 minutes left <p> Bill , If ALL components have been tested and working , something must have been overlooked . Is the heat setting on HIGH ? If you take the vent hose off , do you feel any heat at all coming out ? Have you checked thermal fuse ? Have you checked breaker to be sure dryer is not on 2 different breakers ? -RR <p> I have a whirlpool dryer it gets hot and turns but clothes are still damp after a 120 min drying cycle . ive cleaned it and checked the vents still the same problem checked therm . on heater box with a meter and the coil all is good so what can it be . <p> I found out the problem with mine ! Posting here so others may benefit from it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away . My new dryer did n't  heat up too ! The problem was not with the dryer but the electric wire.The voltages were not enough to heat up the element ! I figured this out when old one with absolutely no problem was gone ! Make sure you check for this = <p> Stephan , Be sure lint catch filter is clean . If lint screen and vent hose are clean and NOT blocked , then the issue probably is within your dryer . Are you sure your dryer is on the highest heat setting ? If everything is as it should be , the first part to check is the thermal fuse on back . If the thermal fuse goes bad , the dryer will spin but will NOT provide any heat . The other parts that could be bad are the coils or thermostats. -RR <p> I have a 5yo Front Loading Samsung DV328AEE/XAA and it has stopped heating . I have cleaned all lint related areas , help the button and tumbler has spun for more than 5 minutes with no heat . Research has shown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or heating element . Is there a way that I can tell witch is the sulprit without ordering all 3 parts ? <p> RB , We would suggest unplugging dryer , removing service panel , and visually inspect inside . You may see something burned or broken . If not you will have to test each component with a multimeter to determine which part is the faulty one . -RR <p> Technician checked fuse and elements . To verify whether timer is a problem , I checked continuity in red and black wires of the timer . It does n't  show continuity . Does this mean timer needs replacement ? or there is easy/cheap way to fix it ? <p> Sarah , Why did the technician not fully troubleshoot your dryer problem ? You need to test the timer in ohms . This will tell you if a particular part of the timer is bad . Set your ohmmeter to the Rx1 setting . A normal reading for a dryer timer is in the 2000 3000 ohms range . You should find the schematic for your dryer to find out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ schematic should tell you the proper resistance reading for your specific dryer timer motor . If the reading you get from testing your dryer timers motor is completely off from the 2000 3000 ohms range then replace the dryer timer motor . Replace just the motor itself and not the entire assembly as this will save you money . -RR <p> Claudia , Make sure lint filter clean . Make sure dryer is on high heat . Be sure the vent hose is clear . Check to see if another setting is set incorrectly . Possibly test thermostats with a multimeter. -RR <p> I have a roper electiric dryer model # REX4635EQ2 that is not drying enough since I changed it from a three prong to a 4 prong . I have checked the continuity on all parts and they are all showing continuity and I cleaned out the vents and the back of the machine . How do I check if the machine is getting the right voltage from the wall without electricuting myself = <p> My 6 years old Fisher and Paykel electrical dryer ( Model # DE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! The drum rotates fines . I called the repair guy . He said he checked everything and seems like timer may be the problem but does n't  guarantee that timer is the problem . Can you please guide me how do I check timer is a problem ? Since timer is very expensive , if it is faulty I would have to buy a new unit and want to make sure before spending lots of money . <p> Sarah , Your dryer has a thermal fuse . Did the technician check the fuse or any of the thermostats ? If so , and they were all ok , then that may be the reason he suggested that the timer may be faulty . Make sure thermostat and fuse is ok , as these are relatively cheap parts compared to an expensive timer . -RR <p> I have a frigidaire stackable , dryer heating fine but clothes kept coming out damp , also would n't collect lint . Checked the back of the dryer and the hose was off the connector on the back of the dryer . Got it back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drying . No lint caught in the hose .. hose was just disconnected off the back of the dryer . Also just replaced the heating element . Thanks ! <p> Darian , Check to be sure the heat setting is set on high . If you just replaced the element , was the reason because it was bad or you just assumed that was the issue ? The hose being off should not effect if your clothes dry . It would actually dry your clothes faster if the hose was off ( since the heat would not have to be pushed many feet through the wall or ceiling ) but it would heat the house and lint would get everywhere . Your new element may not be the exact replacement . This may be the reason your clothes are not drying as fast as before . Make sure the vent hose is attached , set the dryer on high setting and longest heat setting and see what happens . If you still have issues it may be a thermostat issue . -RR <p> My dryer seems to have low air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out , checked and cleaned the vent hose to the outside , but it still does not dry . It does heat , and I replaced the thermostat that is on the air exit from the machine just before the vent hose attaches , the one indicated and sold by the local appliance repair part dealer when I described my problem . It WILL dry fine if I disconnect the vent and allow it to blow air into the room , which should indicate a clogged vent hose or vent on the outside of the house , and obviously that line is blocking airflow enough to make the dryer not dry . BUT , is it possible that the blower is just not strong enough , that it is broken somehow ? It should be able to push air out a ten foot length of cleaned hose right ? I tested the flow by holding a paper towel to the intake on the inside of the drum with it running , and it was very weak , though stronger without the hose attached , but even then , only equal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our tenants- , which is connected with a similar length of hose . Thoughts ? should I replace the corrugated hose with smooth metal ? Is there something wrong with the blower ? Its not particularly noisy . Thank you for considering . -Ryan <p> Ryan , First , make sure the vent hose is not being bent or crimped when the dryer is slid back into place . The shorter the hose the better . You may also need to check with the manufacturer of the dryer to see the specific specs on the blower . You can purchase another blower that may give you a better airflow output . But know this , if the vent hose is long and bent or has many twists and turns because of length , then the blower is having to work extra hard to actually PUSH the air out . And be absolute sure there is no blockage WHATSOEVER in the wall . Meaning lint or other objects . Any slight blockage will cause you issues as you have described . Let us know what you find and get back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having issues with ? -RR <p> Paul , Does the high limit blow as soon as you turn the dryer on ? Is something grounding out on the frame ? Have you checked all wiring ? If all that is good , have you removed the vent hose from the wall and see if that makes a difference just as a test ? -RR <p> I have a Whirlpool Dryer GEQ9800LW1 ITS 1O years old , it recently stopped heating , but still tumbled , so after taking it apart , cleaning out a LOT of dust and debris , all the vents and exhaust pipes . I checked the : Thermal fuse , checks ok , The heating element , checks ok , The thermostats , front one ok , rear one bad , I replaced them both ( thermostats fuses ) and three weeks later its doing the same .. did the same checks .. and its the same one is out again ideas ? ? ? <p> Charles , How many times did you use your dryer in the 3 weeks it worked after you replaced the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in the wall ) is completely cleaned out of all lint buildup . Even if it looks clean , deep in the wall it may not be . Check to be sure the wiring/element is not grounding out and causing a short . -RR <p> Pulled dryer out and cleaned the vent tube with drill duct brush . Dryer still taking 5-7 cycles to dry and the back of the dryer is very hot to the touch . Hoping to fix myself but do n't  know where to turn next . <p> Rob , Instead of us giving paragraphs of advice , try this first Remove the vent hose from the dryer and do a test run . If the dryer still takes forever to dry your clothes , then you will know the dryer itself is the problem . You may have a thermostat that is fluctuating or other temperature control issues . If the dryer does dry your clothing as it should , then you know you still have a major blockage in the wall or vent duct somewhere . -RR <p> I have a Maytag Maxima @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It started to make a humming noise about 15-20 mins into a cycle I shut it off for a min and turned it back on and all was fine . Then the next day I used it and it did the same thing but would n't go away when shutting it off . later that day I used it and it never made the noise at all . Now today it made the noise louder yet after 20 mins of use and then after sitting for a while and continuing the load t went away again . I took the dryer apart earlier today and did n't  see anything wrong the belt looked good and all wheels and pullys spun good and no shaft play in the motor or blower , some light lint build up around the inside of the case but other then that no problems . What could be causing this humming noise ? its not a screech just a loud noisy hum . <p> Kyle , Sounds like you checked all the obvious signs of where the humming could be coming from . Could it actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ panel vibration ? For us not to be able to hear the sound we can only guess but could it be possibly a door issue ? ( Loose screws or door lock loose ? ) Where is the humming sound coming from exactly ? -RR <p> Dryer works ( tumbles ) but will not heat . We replaced the thermal fuse and the dryer worked for about 30 minutes . We then replaced the thermal fuse and the thermistor and the dryer worked for 3 loads . The thermal fuse is not ohming out but now the thermistor is fine . All vents have been cleaned there are no obstructions . Everything is testing fine except for the thermal fuse . Wondering what should we do/test next . Considering ordering the hi limit thermostat along with the thermal fuse since I have read that it is recommended to replace with the thermal fuse . Please help thanks ! ! Just in case this helps- dryer is 2 years old and the model # DLEX2655V . <p> Nicole , Basically a thermal fuse reacts to excessive temperature ( not electrical current @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Assuming you have no air blockage in your vents , the problem could be a defective heating element or the blower which pushes the hot air through the exhaust is bad . Have you checked both parts to be sure they are in proper working order ? <p> Also a defective cycling thermostat can also cause the dryer to overheat if it does not turn off the heat at the proper temperature . <p> Heating element : Have you checked to make sure it is not touching some part of the assembly casing ? You could unplug the dryer , remove the heater assembly and test it for continuity with an ohmmeter just to be sure . <p> Blower : You wo n't feel much air coming from the vent outlet if the blower is bad . -RR <p> Jessica , Your dryer works ( tumbles ) but just will not heat ? It is most likely your dryer is on a double breaker 110V each . One breaker is probably switched off . If your dryer is 220V then make sure both breakers are flipped ON if that applies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let know more detail about your situation . Make and model of your dryer . -RR <p> Hi , I have a 3 year old electric Samsung dryer and it stopped heating . I have replaced heating element ( actually complete house ) and kept the door open and hold button so that drum rotates . And as soon as I turn it on I smell some thing burning , is this because of new element ? but worrying part is I can see smoke inside drum .. Is there some thing wrong , should I call a technician ? <p> Harish , If you see smoke , that COULD mean that the element is just burning off any oils that are on it from production . This is your call but . you could disassemble and be sure your element install is correct or call a technician as if something was wired wrong a fire could occur . <p> Is it possible the heating element is making contact with something ? Insulation , wires , the housing ? -RR <p> I have a gas speed queen dryer that runs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jeans . I checked the vents and there clean checked and replaced both thermostat sensors and still clothes come out a little wet never had this problem before any ideas on what it may be <p> Chris , First , make sure there are not multiple heat settings on your controls . We have seen where a button is pressed to set the dryer to low heat . Check that first . Are you drying the clothes on a different cycle then before ? Have you checked the gas valve to be sure it is working properly ? Have you cleaned out the vents deep inside the walls ? Is the lint screen clean and not damaged ? -RR <p> Doug , Have you used a long bristle wand to clean deep into the vent behind the dryer ? There could be a large build up of lint hidden within it . Also be sure the filter screen is clean and not damaged . -RR <p> E , If the lint catcher on your Dryer is ripped , cut in half , or a part of it is missing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the dryer and most likely clogging the air flow and air vent . Replace the lint screen , clean out the internal dryer of ALL LINT with a shopvac , remove dryer vent hose and clean out . That should fix your dryer problem . Find a new lint screen on Amazon . -RR <p> Hello- My frigidaire electric dryer started making a humming noise 2 days ago , but it was still tumbling and drying the clothes . Yesterday it stopped heating but continued to tumble . Now it will tumble for about 10 minutes without heating and then shut itself off . <p> Autumn , Either the THERMAL FUSE or the THERMOSTAT(S) is on the fritz . You can test them with a multimeter to see if they are working properly . Those 2 parts are very common and are available on Amazon under the " Appliance replacement parts " category . If you have more info for us , please let us know and we can continue to further troubleshoot. -RR <p> Josh , Your dryer timer more than likely needs to be replaced . Test @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heater element on timed dry mode . If the timer is not sending power , it will need to be replaced . You can test the timer with a multimeter . You could chance it and just purchase a new timer as that is really the only thing that supplies power to the heating element . -RR <p> Dan , Best thing to do is open the machine up on the back and do a visual sweep to possibly find an obvious issue . If the filter needs cleaned after each drying load , that is normal but having a large amount of lint will depend on what you are drying . -RR <p> I have tested all the thermostats , clycling &amp; high heat . Unfortunately my dryer does not have a choice of temperature settings . There is not an external temperature selector that I can test . My dryer is a 110.96512200 Kenmore . I was wondering if the timer might be going bad . Unfortunately it is not sold at Sears parts anymore . The dryer is about 21 years old . One thing that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thermal cutoff fuse on the heater box are charred and look almost fried . Not sure how that happened so as a last ditched effort I 'm going to cut them back to good wire and put new terminals on them and see if that helps . If that does n't  work I 'm not sure what to do next . <p> Thanks for your reply RR , I removed the heater element from the heater box and when I tested the resistance on the two terminals it measured 0 OHMS . Why is a reading of 0 OHMS bad for a heater element when it still shows continuity ? <p> Ivan , Heating elements can be tricky depending on age and type we just wanted to be sure it showed continuity . Anyway .. Does your dryer have a choice of temp settings ? If so then there are separate thermostats used for each setting . Have you made certain to test and troubleshoot the multiple thermostats ? The selector switch or timer control routes the circuit through to the appropriate thermostat so maybe one of them are bad or on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ switch is cool and no continuity when it is warmer than its rated temperature . Hope that may help a little ! Let us know ! -RR <p> My dryer has proven to be very frustrating to repair . The dryer stopped heating and I saw that the Thermal Cutoff Fuse on the upper part of my heating element box was blown . I went to sears and purchased another and replaced that along with the high heat thermometer and the Thermal Cutoff Fuse blew again . <p> At this point I have done all of the following to try to find out why the fuse keeps blowing . <p> 1 . I removed the blower housing and saw that is was 2/3s clogged right in front of the blower wheel . I cleared it and washed everything so that even inside was clean . Have really good airflow now . <p> 2 . I checked my exhaust duct and there were not blockages . It has been working just fine for almost a year now with the two bends in it . So that is not the problem . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chute/blowing housing which is rated for 150 degrees . I placed it on a griddle and at 150 degrees it disengaged . Then when it cooled back down it allowed electrical flow . I did this twice and it worked well . I checked the electrical flow using a multi-tester . So that is not the problem . <p> 4 . I checked the thermal fuse on my blower housing/lint chute and it was still intact . This was located directly above my cycling thermostat . <p> 5 . I started to wonder if my heating elements themselves were bad . I did a Ohms test using an analog multi-tester on the heating element terminals just to make sure they were still all in one piece . The test showed continuity , 0 ohms to be exact . I then tested to see if the heating elements had been grounded by touching the outside of the heating box with one lead on the outside of my heater box and the other lead to each of the two terminals ( one at a time ) . There was infinity resistance so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took the heater box off the dyer to visually inspect the elements and everything look good . Nothing was worn down . <p> 6 . I checked my drum seal to see if it might be allowing air to get sucked in bypassing the heater box . It still fit nicely and was tight all the way around . <p> After trying all of those steps I purchased another Thermal Cutoff Fuse and it also blew . I 'm very frustrated and we are tired of running back and forth to the laundry mat . <p> There is no external temperature switch for me to check on this model dryer and now I am lost as to what to look for next . <p> Can anyone think of anything else that might be causing my dryer to overheat to the point where the thermal fuse on my heater box keeps blowing ? <p> Hi Ivan , Sounds like your dryer is making your like hell .. Anyway , if your heating element is reading continuity of 0 ohms then its bad . Did you have it installed in the dryer when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first ? See here . -RR <p> Hi Liz , Sounds like you need the tension clamps for your dryer hose . Have a look at this dryer vent hose with clamps picture and if that is the type of hose you have then you need the retaining rings . If you already have them then you may not have them on correctly . -RR <p> I have a whirlpool electric front load dryer that is not heating up or drying the clothes . I have recently replaced the thermostat and the heating coil . The dryer vent on the dryer has been cleaned out , the hose is not clogged up and the hose exhaust unit is cleaned out . The power plug is plugged in to a 220 outlet.In-fact i havent put the hose back on the dryer after repairing each item . I plug it in and try the power button options and have tried several positions on the controls but it puts out no warm air . So it is still not heating up ? Just blows cold air . The drum will turn and everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Hi Sherwin , Make and model of your dryer ? The drum will not turn by hand or while it is powered ? Does the dryer make a humming noise , can you hear the motor ? If you are trying to run your dryer and the drum will not turn , then a broken belt is the most likely problem . -RR <p> Hi , I just had my dryer fixedit just did n't  work . When the technician came , he replaced the thermal fuse . I was using it after he left , when the full cycle was done and I was taking the clothes out , the outside of the dryer was too hot and even the clothes are too hot to touch . What would be the problem this time of the dryer ? <p> Hi Mokang , Having a clogged air duct hose/vent can cause your dryer to overheat . However the thermal fuse should blow if this is the case . It may be possible that the issue ( before the technician came out ) was a clogged vent , therefore the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and quit possibly the thermal fuse will blow again . OR There is a thermostat in your dryer that monitors the temperature in the blower and turns the heating element ( or gas burner ) on and off as needed to keep the proper temperature . If the thermostat is at fault and cant sense the air temperature , the heating element ( or gas burner ) can stay energized too long . This can create a temperature that is unsafe in the drum . So it may be possible the thermostat is at fault . OR The wrong thermal fuse could have been installed and it is not blowing ( tripping ) when the temperature gets too high . -RR <p> Hi there , I have an United UDR 4767D dryer that wont dry . I have opened it up and took out a lot of lint , basically teared it down and vacuumed almost everything , he s heating normally and the drum spins , I assure you that there is no lint anywhere . I even took the motor from the housing and checked there for lint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together but still not as dry as I want , its pretty damp even after 120 minutes . By the way its an ventless dryer <p> Hi David , Are you able to tell if the dryer is heating up ? It may be that the High Limit Thermostat has tripped and the dryer is not heating . The dryer may be able to slightly dry your clothes from just the " tumbling " action . You can open up the back panel and see if you can locate the thermostat that may be resettable . There could also be a number of other problems but the thermostat or thermal fuse is most likely causing your issue . <p> A ventless dryer can take a long time to dry your clothing . Some ventless dryers may take between 2 and 4 hours to dry a half load of clothes . If you have a full load of clothes you are trying to dry , remove 50% of the clothing to assist the limit of the dryers drying capability . -RR <p> I rent a house where the washer and electric @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is no exhaust hose attached to the dryer . There does n't  seem to be much heat build in the dryer . In fact , it feels like the clothes only get dry through their constant movement in the drum and what little warm air is inside the drum . However , when I put my hand up to the exhaust vent ( back of the dryer , in the center at the bottom ) the air coming out feels a lot hotter than what is in the drum . How can I have warm air in the drum yet very hot air coming out of the exhaust vent ? Thx for your response . Great site ! <p> Hi David , We would need the brand and model number so we know the exact components that may be malfunctioning . However We would suggest removing power , removing the service access panel and have a look inside . Inspect for anything that may be burned , clogged , or loose . If there is hot air coming from the back of the dryer , then this sounds as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buildup of lint on the inside frame that is somehow redirecting or reducing the heat needed to dry your clothing . -RR <p> I have a 4 year old Samsung front loader washer and dryer . We moved into a new house one year ago and dryer has not worked the same . We have no basement so the vent goes up the wall out of the roof of house , about 20 feet . 2 repair men came out and said that the newer front loaders can not have a hose longer than 3 feet max for the vent . I am amazed , what do people in condos do with their dryers ? My options are to move the dryer to another room , which is almost impossible , or have hose go under house into crawl space . About 3 feet down . Not sure how safe that is . Can you help me out here , I am out of options . Motor coils everything else is working fine on dryer .. When they tested it , when hose was on , it heated only to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When they took hose off , it heated to 152 degrees for over 2 minutes .. I am out of options at this point . Please help . <p> Hi Lisa , Having read the description of your problem , the obvious problem sounds to be a clogged vent hose or massive lint buildup in the wall ( or roof area ) . If you had repair technicians testing your machine , they more than likely checked this . However there is no other explanation for the dryer to work perfectly when the vent hose is off . The machine is designed to shut off heat if it senses an air vent blockage to prevent fire . We would suggest to inspect the vent hose for any blockage . Once you determine it is free of obstructions , use a hand wand vacuum and get out as much lint from the wall ( or the roof area where the hose vents out ) as possible . If you have heavy lint buildup in the wall , you may need to hire a company who specializes in clearing this . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we have heard this but have seen much longer vent hoses on dryers . A vent hose at 20 feet does sound very long . However if the hose is free from blockage and in a straight enough line , you should be able to use the dryer as normal . -RR <p> Hi Latoya , We are assuming your dryer tumbles but does not heat . This could be that your dryer is 220V and the secondary breaker is off . Check the breakers to make sure they are on . Also , your dryer MAY have a thermal fuse that blew . If this is the case then the dryer will not heat . The way to test the fuse is to check with a multimeter for continuity . Another issue or the cause of this problem could be that the vent pipe is blocked by lint . Make sure there is nothing blocking the vent pipe . If after making sure the above scenarios are not the cause , please let us know your model number and brand of dryer for us to troubleshoot further . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dryer exhaust pipe and the vent hose , both are 95% clear . I was actually surprised by how little lint was in the hose . I guess the lint screen does a really good job . Just to be thorough , I also checked the external vent and the airflow seems to be unrestricted all the way out of the house . <p> Andrew , Usually we would say to check continuity in the thermal fuse and thermostats , but since the problem is intermittent , it could be a few different things . <p> The most likely part that is creating the intermittent heating issue is the gas valve solenoid . This valve or valves are electric solenoids . The solenoid opens the valve for the gas to flow into the burner . If the dryer does n't  heat or heats intermittent , the solenoid may be at fault . You can check the solenoids with a multimeter to find out if they are causing the issue . <p> Another part that may be on the fritz is the flame sensor . A gas dryer has a flame @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If the dryer has heating issues , the flame sensor might be defective . The way to check this is to test the sensor for continuity . <p> You may also want to remove the control panel and make sure there are no burned areas on the back where the controls are located . -RR <p> Hi , I have a Whirlpool " duet Electronic Gas dryer " and I 'm trying to figure out if its worth calling a repairman , working on it myself , or just replacing . The dryer will turn on and and the drum spins just fine , but on certain presets the unit will not heat . That 's the part that boggles my mind . On some settings it heats up , and on others it does n't  . It would make more sense if the working/nonworking settings were 100% consistent , but I do n't  think they are . Any help is much appreciated ! <p> Andrew , Since there is no error code , a very common problem with a dryer heating intermittently is a clogged venting system . You may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to run normally but not always heat up . We recommend to remove the vent hose from the wall and see if it may be clogged with so much lint that it is not possible to vent . If this is not your issue , let us know and we will respond back with what to try next -RR <p> Hello , my dryer stopped producing heat , yet still turns . I have replaced the heating element , thermostat and thermal fuse . Cleaned out the lint trap , exhaust hose and the internal exhaust duct . What else should I consider before calling a repair person ? I am in need of a quick fix , but would prefer to do it myself . <p> Hi Jenny , Since you have already replaced the majority of parts that would cause your dryer to not heat Visually inspect the exterior wiring to the dryer . Check the service cord prongs that plug into the wall for burn marks and check where the service cord hooks to the terminal block on the back of dryer . Also , perform an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are no burnt or frayed wires . One broken connection can allow the dryer drum and timer to operate properly but there will be no heat . <p> Do you have a multimeter ? With your dryer unplugged ohm out the heater and thermostat . Ohm meter check the timer points . Ohm meter check the motor switch . Ohm meter check for open wires or look for burnt wires . Performing this should tell you where the fault is located . -RR <p> Hi Everardo , If your dryer runs ( drum turns ) but the dryer is not producing heat , the most likely part that is at fault is the dryer thermal fuse . If you have a meter you can test it . If not , it is a very cheap part and can be found online for around $10 dollars . Here is our Dryer Fuse Replacement Repair Guide . Have a look and hopefully this will fix your clothes dryer . -RR <p> My Kenmore 90 series electric dryer spins but gives out no heat . Opened and took the drum out , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the lint . I 'm hesitant to put it back together , in case I need to open it again if it still does not work after cleaning . What else could I check while the dryer is open ? <p> Hi Ray , Try setting the HEAT TEMP to a lower setting .

This is a fairly simple project and can be completed with any type of flat topped coffee table no matter how large . We purchased a used coffee table in fair condition for $10 dollars at a yard sale . Once we had our coffee table we then needed pennies , LOTS AND LOTS OF PENNIES ! We went to the bank and asked the teller for 2000 pennies = $20 dollars worth . The teller was not very happy ! Next we went to Home Depot and purchased our Super Glaze ( Ultra Gloss Epoxy ) for around $25 dollars . This type of epoxy is self leveling as any type of liquid would be . When we were done with this project we were set back around $50 dollars total ( Not bad for a customized coffee table with a coin penny top ! ) and this project took around 3 days total but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that long . Super gluing 2000 pennies onto the top of the table took us about a day which was the most tedious part of the complete project .

Then see below for our cool photo step-by-step method for doing this yourself <p> Here is our $10 dollar yard sale coffee table . The top was nice and smooth so we left it as is . We measured it out and figured how many pennies we would need = 2000 pennies ! <p> Next we started laying out the pennies and securing them to the table with common super glue . This took us a full day as the pennies had to be aligned perfectly and be touching one another . <p> Here is our coffee table with all 2000 pennies super glued onto the top and perfectly arranged .

Note : When pouring the epoxy mixture , make sure your table is level or you will have problems !

We added wood " pour borders to the sides of our table top so the epoxy would not drip . ( not shown in photo . ) <p> Here is the super glaze epoxy we used for the top of our DIY penny table . This package was the perfect amount to cover our table entirely and efficiently . Note : If your table will contain more that 2000 pennies then you will need another box of the epoxy . <p> The kit contains one resin and one activator . They are mixed together and begin to harden . This is just like using a small tube of 5 minute epoxy but on a larger scale . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a blow torch handy .

@@13196870 @1796870/ <h> Best Way To Stop Weeds from Growing in a Brick Walkway <p> Those darn weeds , they keep coming back year after year . Here are some suggestions to help stop the weeds in their tracks . <p> The smartest thing to try first ( before using harsh chemicals ) is spend some time controlling the situation with a hand-held garden weeder . Make sure to pull the weeds up by the roots . Then , spend some time each week pulling up the weeds in the pathway . Remember that mechanical weeding is always the most economical and the safest method for removing and stopping weeds . An amazing tool that removes the weeds from areas hard to get into , such as weeds in between a brick walkway , is " Oswego GW-1 Grandpas Weeder " . This tool is available at Amazon here for $25 bucks . <p> " Oswego GW-1 Grandpas Weeder " <p> Now if you do not want to take that route or you do not have the time and you are considering using harsh chemicals or pesticides Remember that anything you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) that these are just non-synthetic pesticides and will need to be mechanically or hand removed in the very near future . Most weeds will come back and you will just be spraying them time and time again . You will be killing the photosynthetic elements of the weed but not the weed itself . <p> If you do n't  have time for all this you can use a pre-emergent weed control , such as Surflan . ( It is a pre-emergent synthetic pesticide chemical and prevents weed seeds from germinating ) . A pre-emergent only needs to be applied once a year during season and will have very little potential for leaching into other areas if you apply it according to the label . It also will not kill any non-target plants . The best thing to do here is to get everything weeded out , then apply pre-emergent to all of the cracks or areas needing weed control . <p> So if using a chemical that is bad for the environment bothers you then soapy water works too . A solution of concentrated dish detergent mixed with water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the roots . <p> If you want to make a super-charged homemade weed killer yourself , the soap and vinegar mixture gives you more bang for the buck . Apple cider vinegar works best . <p> And remember this , it is easier to kill weeds organically if you spray them when they are seedlings than if you wait until they are large and grown . The best thing to do to gain control over those weeds is to get out there once a week and walk the path with your garden weed removing tool and spray bottle filled with your homemade weed killer . <p> Depending on where your heavily weeded path is in relation to the rest of your plants , salt works also . We have seen it used on gravel driveways and other areas where the ground has good access for weed killers . Salt was used here because the land on either side was beautiful organic growing fields and the salt is not able to accidentally spray everywhere because of the weight of the salt and how it soaks into the ground . Please @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will ever grow there again . <p> Hey there ! I wanted to say there is a better mixture then the ingredients listed that I have found to work well at killing weeds for atty least the season when I 'm trying to grow in my garden . Use the same mixture you have above but increase by a half cup of salt and half cup of liquid soap and spray the weeds . Then the next morning spill a gallon or more of boiling water in the same spot . This works the best as I do n't  like to use any store bought chemicals or pesticides. =

Hope this helps some people and adds to the excellent post . <p> Reset GE and Hotpoint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refrigerators press and hold the reset water filter button on the dispenser for 3 seconds then release . If your system uses a color LED light , the light should have changed from red to green , indicating the filter reminder has been reset . <p> I have a refrigerator which had the water filter in the back , so I guess it was an older model , however , I have recently purchased a reverse osmosis system after reading , and realizing what is actually in our water . After I had read about everything , I realized that many water filters can not filter out most of the contaminants in the water , and ended up hooking my reverse osmosis system to my refrigerator as the water filter and it really was n't that hard . Many people do n't  realize this is possible , even though they already have a reverse osmosis system , as one of my friends was surprised to see I had my system hooked up in this way . This is the best way to ensure your water is filtered properly , and you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changes for the refrigerator , as you get all the filters for a reverse osmosis system for the same price , and possibly cheaper .

Whether your water faucet is old or new and it has low water pressure , here are some help tips . <p> Remove the aerator with a wrench turning it counter clockwiseClean out the gunk that was causing the low water flow and reinstall <p> If this happens on an older faucet , then the reason for low water pressure is a dirty or clogged faucet aerator . You will need to unscrew the aerator from the faucet using a wrench or possibly by turning it with your hand . Once removed , take the aerator apart and clean all the components . The parts that are contained in an aerator are a washer , flow restrictor , mixer , bushing , screen , outer housing and the aerator body itself . Once cleaned of all the gunk , reinstall it and test water flow . Your faucet should now be flowing with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new faucet recently installed , then obviously it can not be a clogged aerator . The first thing to check is to make sure both the hot and cold water shutoff valves under the sink are fully in the open position . A half closed or half open valve will reduce water pressure . If they are both fully open , then the new faucet may have an internal defect that is causing the low water flow . The best way to see if the faucet is defective is to test the water supply pressure . Do this by turning off the water to the faucet under the sink . Next , remove the hot and cold lines from the faucet body . Get a bucket and put the hot and cold lines from the wall into the bucket . Turn the water valve on for the cold and see if the water pressure spraying into the bucket is high or low . Do the same with the hot water line . If the water pressure is normal , then there is a defect in the new faucet . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issue with the water pressure coming in at that point . <p> This is the water shutoff valve located under your sink <p> Now , if all of your sinks have low water pressure or low flow , then the problem is the water supply coming into your home . It is possible that the water valve outside that turns your water on and off to your home may be partially closed or partially open . Go outside and locate your water shutoff valve and check that it is fully in the open position . Many times when living in an apartment or condo , a person working on something may turn the water off on your place by mistake . This is because many of the water shutoff valves are grouped together and usually not labelled . So if you have partial or no water in your home or apartment , check the water shutoff valve outside . <p> This is the city water shutoff valve located outside Make sure it is fully open <p> If the water valve outside is fully open , then call your water company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ area . Most of the time the city will do a quick water line repair in the street or elsewhere and turn the water supply off for a short time . So call them and see if this is what has happened . <p> bj , For us to better understand , tell us , you have NO water in the kitchen after installing a new shower ? Is the water pressure simply weak in the kitchen or are you getting no water to the kitchen at all ? Check the water on/off shut off valves under your kitchen sink to be sure they are fully open . -RR <p> This was excellent repair advice . Cleaning the clogged faucet aerator solved my problem . In less than five minutes my problem was resolved . I was considering calling a plumber . You probably saved me at least a hundred dollars . Plumbers are not cheap . Thanks ! 
@@13196876 @1796876/ <h> How To Soak Clothes In A Front Loading Washing Machine <p> If you are the proud owner of a new Front Loading Washing Machine you know that there is no easy way to soak your clothes . The old style top loading washers made it easy to " stop " the wash cycle and soak your clothes . The new style front loading washing machines have a door on the front of the unit instead of on the top . Clothes are washed in a barrel drum that is configured horizontally instead of vertically . A plus side to the new washers is that the high efficiency front load machine washers use much less water than the older top loading washers . Most of the new front loaders do not have a " soak " cycle . So , even though this is the case it is still possible to soak soiled clothes in your new front loading washer . If your washing machine is not spinning you can perform a master reset . <h> Instructions To Soak Clothes In Front Load Washers <p> Step 1 Add clothes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make sure it locks.Step 2 Add 1/4 cup of detergent into the detergent pull out drawer . Liquid OxiClean works great to soak your clothes no matter what color . ( Do not add detergent directly to the inside of the washer drum ) Step 3 Program your washing machine for the correct water temperature , size and type.Step 4 Start the machine . Water will then enter the washing machine barrel drum . You will then hear an audible click and a light will illuminate telling you that the front door is now locked by the machine.Step 5 The washer will fill with the remaining amount of water . Watch through the window for the drum to start spinning your clothes.Step 6 Let the machine run for 5 minutes to allow sufficient time to disperse some of the detergent into the drum . After 5 minutes press the " Stop " button to stop the programmed washing cycle . The water stays in the barrel and the clothes will begin to soak . Allow approximately 30 minutes to let your clothes soak . After 30 minutes press the " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clothes to wash and let washer run through cycle to drain all water and unlock front door . <h> Can you soak clothes overnight in a front loading washer ? <p> Yes . Most HE front loading washers do not have a soak cycle . However stopping the cycle and letting it sit overnight is perfectly fine . You can also run the cycle from 5 to 10 minutes and then pause it for a few hours to soak the load . Then you can simply turn the washer back on and let it run through the complete cycle . <h> My front load washer does not pause or stop , How do I soak clothes another way ? <p> You can use a 5 gallon bucket to soak your clothes . After the clothes soak in the bucket overnight you can simply dump the whole thing right into the washer . Also , if your washing machine does not have a soak cycle selection then simply start a cycle and let it fill and get the clothes wet . Next , turn the machine off or disconnect the power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A normal soak cycle on a front load washer fills with more water than for a standard wash . The machine rotates the drum one turn every few minutes to keep the clothes wet . <h> Can I fill my front loader washer with liquid bleach ? <p> Soaking with bleach is really not a good idea . Bleach is rough on all fabrics and the effect the bleach has maxes out in 5 minutes . Automatic bleach dispensers on front loaders will trigger the bleach in the first rinse or in the last few minutes of the washing cycle . If you do have to use bleach then use a type that is not liquid . Always try using the soaking method with detergent before resorting to the bleach method . <p> Do you have Questions , Tips or Hints ? Please feel free to write a comment below . <p> Maytag front loaders are still able to do a long pre-wash soak even if you do n't  have a " Soak " cycle . You just have to outsmart the washer ! <p> Add items to the tub @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Normal , add bleach to the dispenser , set temperature to hot , and press the Start/Pause button . The machine will tumble and fill with water . When water is no longer being added to the tub , press the Start/Pause button ONCE . The machine will stop tumbling and soak the load indefinitely . ( I have done soaks for 30+ minutes . ) The bleach water will not drain out until you press the Cancel button . Do that and allow the water to drain . Then start over by selecting Normal , adding detergent ( and more bleach if you need it ) to the dispenser cups , and press Start . Presto ! You have learned how to do a manual soak cycle . <p> On my LG front loader there is a button that says rinse and spin . So when I do a soak I put in the clothes and some borax or OxiClean and I press the rinse and spin button . Once the machine has filled with water , it will agitate for a minute or two and then I press @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will simply turn itself off without draining the water that 's in there . The rinse and spin cycle puts in a lot more water than normal so its easy to soak the clothes . On my machine if you want to have it agitate a little more just press the power button and then press the start/pause and it will agitate a little more then press pause again and it will turn itself off after a few minutes as usual . Once you feel enough time has gone by for the soak just press the power button to turn the machine on and then press the Pause start button . The machine will just finish the rinse and spin and turn itself off at the end of the cycle . Then I just put regular detergent and any more clothing in the machine that did n't  need a soak and I just do a normal cycle .

If you are using a laundromat the machines may not be cleaned or wiped down very often . <p> 2 . The clothes are not taken out of the machine fast enough when the wash is done .

Thanks . <p> Hi MS , You can use Self Adhesive Foam or Plastic Leg Pad Protectors . These will self adhere to the bottom of any type of table legs to make it easier to move the table but also protect from scratching the floor and causing damage . -RR

@@13196885 @1796885/ <h> Dishwasher Will Not Turn On How To Fix <p> If your dishwasher wont turn on or start , here are a few things to check yourself before calling a technician . The most common problems with a dishwasher not getting power or lights not turning on are listed below . You can follow the steps below to repair your dishwasher and get it working again . The issues below are listed in order of most probable causes starting at the top of the list . <p> Note : The majority of dishwashers ( whether Maytag , Kitchen Aid , Frigidaire , Kenmore , Whirlpool , and Bosch ) work the same way . Using this guide to troubleshoot your dishwasher works for all dishwashers on the market today . <p> Dishwasher Getting Power ? If your dishwasher does not light up or is not getting power , check where the dishwasher plugs into the wall . Be sure it is plugged in . If the outlet the dishwasher plugs into is a GFI outlet , make sure it has not tripped . Reset the GFI if needed. - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can unplug the dishwasher and plug something else in to be sure the outlet is getting power . ) If the dishwasher is plugged in and the GFI has not tripped , then check the breaker on the wall and make sure it has not tripped and is in the on position . <p> Defective Door Switch ? The next thing that could be causing your dishwasher to not start could be the door switch . This door switch is also sometimes called a door lock or door interlock switch . This switch is a safety feature and makes it so the dishwasher will not run if the door is open . If your dishwasher wont start , then it is possible this switch is bad . This switch is located inside the door panel . To determine if the door switch is bad , remove the control panel , locate the door switch , and test it for continuity . <p> Blown Thermal Fuse ? Another part in your dishwasher that could be causing it to not start could be the thermal fuse . This fuse is designed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it will need to be removed and replaced to make your dishwasher work . Most dishwashers have the thermal fuse located in the control panel area . To determine if the thermal fuse is bad , remove the control panel , locate the fuse , and test it for continuity . <p> Broken Door Latch ? The part that holds your dishwasher door shut is called a door latch . 99% of the time this latch is made from plastic . If this latch becomes broken or cracked , it will prevent your door from closing properly . To determine if your door latch is bad , inspect your dishwasher door and be sure the latch is not broken . <p> Defective Main Control Board ? The control board in your dishwasher supplies power to all components . If your dishwasher wont start , this could mean that the board is bad .

Its not a problem with the drain being plugged . The drain cycle is n't even starting . The lights are still on . Then eventually the machine will turn off . I think it has something to do with the door latch . But ca n't figure out why the wash cycle works but not the drain . <p> I had this blinking light problem on a GE GDF520PGD2WW dishwasher where when you push the START button , the unit would not come on and after a few seconds the green light would start to blink . Here 's what my problem was and is likely what is happening with many of these GE dishwashers . Fortunately , the SOLUTION IS SIMPLE : PROBLEM : The dishwasher door has a plastic strike that is shaped like a fin . When the door is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the dishwasher 's housing . The problem in my case is that the strike was not hitting the switch ( attempting to strike below the switch ) If you use a flashlight , it 's hard to tell but it is detectable . The reason it is not hitting the switch is because when the dishwasher was mounted to the underside of the counter top , the screws drew the top of the housing ever so slightly upward and caused the top of the unit to bow . Thus , the strike misses the switch by striking just below the switch . To test this , reset the unit by pressing and holding the START button for 3 seconds . While the door is open , use a knife to depress the switch on the housing of the unit ( where the fin would normally strike the switch ) . Then press the START button . If the dishwasher comes on , then you know this is your problem . Remove the knife and the unit will stop ( simulating a door open condition ) . <p> SOLUTION : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between the countertop and the top center of the housing ( just above the strike plate switch ) . You goal is to force the top of the housing to push downward about an 1/8 so that the door strike ( the fin ) will hit the switch when the door is closed . To wedge the shim into place , you 'll need a small crowbar or screwdriver to create the needed gap to slide the shim into place . Test it and once positioned where it works reliably , glue the shim into place ( Elmers is fine ) . <p> I have a similar but not exact same problem with a 2010 Kenmore dishwasher . The start button will light but immediately go out . If the breaker is recycled , the machine starts and works welluntil the next time we try to start it . Then we have to reset the breaker again .

Then plug the dishwasher extension cord into another outlet ON A DIFFERENT BREAKER and run a wash cycle . This will be for testing purposes only .

Let us know what you find , and if you need more assistance , please supply us with the model number of your Kenmore dishwasher . -RR <p> When the breaker for the dishwasher in the fuse panel is cycled the cancel light comes on and it sounds like the dishwasher is doing some sort of initial testing but then the cancel light goes out and subsequently the machine reverts to the lighting problems listed above . <p> I have a 2-3 year old Bosch dishwasher that 's been working fine .

Any ideas ? <p> I had the same issue with my Bosch , stopped mid cycle . Thought it was the main board , but the issue was much easier to fix .

If the fuse is not the issue , then check the wire harnesses to be sure they are secure . If all seems okay , then you may have another bad board if the unit is 100% dead and no lights work . -RR <p> Sarah , Be sure you have the wire harnesses plugged in tight and correctly . Be sure where the electrical plug goes into the outlet that the small GFCI breaker is not reset .

Otherwise , where can I find the good thermal fuse ? <p> Edith , The thermal fuse on your dishwasher may be a part of the control board . What is happening to your dishwasher ? It will not power on ? Here is the schematic and parts list for your GE PDWT580V00SS Dishwasher . -RR <p> I have the same issue with the thermal fuse . For some reason my dishwasher is overheating ever so often .

Thanks <p> Ralph , It sounds like you may have a faulty pressure switch on your Kitchenaid Dishwasher . If the pressure switch is bad , this will cause too much heat and can and will blow the thermal fuse . Check the pressure switch and replace if needed . Concerning the fuse You have to replace the wires that come in the Thermal fuse kit to permanently fix the fuse from going out constantly . -RR <p> Geralyn , Is the front panel of your Maytag dishwasher getting any power whatsoever ?

Any suggestions ? <p> Sherri , Have you tried to reset the dishwasher ? If you press start and on/off buttons at same time , will it reset ? If the display settings on your Bosch dishwasher will not switch to the wash cycle or respond to the buttons you press , most likely either the control pad or control board are bad or have loose wiring . It will have to be opened up and checked to be sure the wires are secure the control board will need to be checked visually for burns or melted components . -RR <p> Hi , i couldnt locate the fuse but could see what i think is the control board . The wires are all connected , no signs of burning or melting . The model i own seems quiet different to ones that i have seen on the web with demos on how to repair . Do you know this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see what i could but its all very neat and well packaged , hard to see any problems . My head is fried lol if that helps . Cheers again . <p> Karl , The board could be bad even if it looks to be in perfect condition . Be sure that the control panel is getting power . If you have a meter , check to be absolute sure the board and panel area is getting the proper voltage . You may also want to recheck all the wiring if the dishwasher cord and plug got fried in water . Be sure it is not a simple wiring issue somewhere in the dishwasher before you replace an expensive control board . To troubleshoot the wiring and power issue , start from the power source and work your way up . -RR <p> Hi , yesterday my Bosch dishwasher SMS40C12GB made 2 large electrical crackling noises before blowing the fuse .

But still no power do you think it has burnt the whole circuit ? ? Need help . <p> Karl , If the plug and cord got fried from getting wet , this may have fried the control board in the dishwasher . Can you open the dishwasher panel up and have a look at the control board ? There is a fuse in the panel area and this may have fried also . Have a look inside the panel as you may find an obvious sign of damage . -RR <p> Jasper , You can find out if your dishwasher will not start by testing the fuse with a meter first . If the fuse is bad then replace the fuse . If the fuse is good , then you may have a control board issue . Usually you will see a burn or scorch mark on the control board , but it may not be that obvious .

I do n't  know if the two things are linked . Can you help me ? <p> Maria Chiara , Is there a certain pattern of the lights flashing on your Bosch dishwasher ? Do the lights blink a certain number of times , then pause , and flash again ? Can you count the number of flashes between the pause ? If there is no pattern and the dishwasher just flashes , try unplugging the dishwasher for 5 minutes and then plug back in to see if that clears it .

If it IS getting power , try unplugging it to reset if the front panel does not get power . If you still are not getting power to the front panel of the dishwasher , you may have a bad door switch , control board , or the control panel fuse has blown .

What could be the issue . <p> Francesca , Have you checked to be sure your dishwasher is not plugged into a GFCI outlet and the outlet is tripped ? If the outlet is okay and the unit IS getting power , there may be an issue inside the control panel .

@@13196893 @1796893/ <h> How To Fix A Washing Machine Making A Buzzing Noise <p> When a washer makes a buzzing sound , the most common fault is that there is something stuck in the pump and blocking it .

As a blocked pump is the most probable cause for a buzzing washer , there can also be a other problems that can cause this noise . We will list the most common reasons for this problem beginning with the most probable first . If your washing machine is NOT buzzing but instead your washer is not spinning or draining during the cycle , then a different troubleshooting method is needed . <p> MOST PROBABLE REASONS FOR A BUZZING SOUND IN WASHING MACHINE : <p> Blocked Drain Pump : An object has lodged itself inside of the drain pump . There can be items such as a small sock , a coin , a toothpick , or something small in your clothes pockets when you wash them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up in the drain pump causing it to become blocked and make the buzzing noise you hear .

For example , today I ran the washer empty following a new part . Ran fine . We washed a load of table linens . Ran fine . I threw in a load of towels .

Thanks in advance for any help you can provide . <p> ChrisO , From the detailed description you have provided Sounds like the washer drive motor is occasionally overheating from larger loads , therefore tripping the thermal overload circuit in the motor and making it stop working for a short period of time .

Any thoughts ? <p> Keith , Is the washer working properly besides the buzzing noise ? If the timer motor is buzzing , that may be an indication that there is a bad spot on the timer motor . You can try opening up the control panel and inspecting the wires and the timer control and motor . If all the wire harnesses are secure in the control panel , and the buzzing persists , you may want to remove and replace it . If the washer is still working properly , you can leave it as is but in the near future it may fail and the washer will not go into certain cycles . -RR <p> I just replaced the door lock assembly on my Frigidaire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lock area makes a loud buzzing sound .

Any other ideas in the meantime ? <p> Yvonne , If the door buzzes be sure you put the correct OEM door switch in your Frigidaire washer . Some generic washer parts MAY NOT fit perfectly and therefore buzzing and vibration will occur . Either way be sure it is secure and tight or vibration may occur . Re-tighten the screws holding it in place . Also , be sure it is correctly in place and seated properly . If you do have an OEM part , and it is installed correctly , and the buzzing vibration persists , then yes a new strike may be needed . Also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if these become loose the door can droop down and not line up perfectly and therefore cause the buzzing sound from vibration . -RR <p> I have had the exact same problem with my Frigidaire Affinity washer front load .

I have a small space heater in my bedroom so I stay extra warm when I sleep . The problem is the wall outlet is too far away from my bed and the electrical cord on the space heater is only about 3 feet long . If so , do I use the type of extension cord with 2 or 3 prongs ? The small portable ceramic space heater has a thermostat so it shuts off when it gets to the set temperature . Will setting the temperature " not as warm " make it safer if I use an extension cord ? <p> For safety , ALWAYS plug a Space Heater DIRECTLY into the wall outlet using the electrical cord on the space heater and NEVER use a power strip or extension cord . This is because a space heater , no matter what size , draws a high amount of electricity and can overload a circuit or overheat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Space heater with burnt 2 prong extension cord <p> If possible , get a space heater that plugs DIRECTLY into the wall outlet .

Also , if the extension cord is not plugged into the space heater tight and secure , this can also be a fire hazard . <p> If your space heater electrical cord is not long enough to keep you warm while you sleep , we would suggest either getting a new space heater with a longer cord , using your central home heating , or possibly having another electrical outlet professionally installed in your bedroom . <p> Any type of space heater whether whole room , personal space , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uses a high consumption of electricity .

Put the space heater on a sturdy table and closer to the edge of the table so the table does not get burnt .

@@13196896 @1796896/ <h> How To Build A Shelving Cabinet From A Wooden Pallet <p> There are literally hundreds of things to make from a wooden pallet . Here is a simple way to a make a shelving cabinet shelf from 3 average sized wood pallets . Making furniture from a wood pallet is a great way to recycle an older pallet that may be headed to the trash dump . By reusing a pallet already created you are helping the environment and creating something yourself that has a purpose . Projects like this are fun and very challenging and let you use your creative side by building something unique . At the same time you are actually helping the landfills stay slightly emptier by recycling a pallet into some useful DIY furniture . It is a win win situation ! See below for our simple step by step process for turning 3 wooden pallets into a cool dresser cabinet shelf unit . <p> We started out with 3 normal sized square pallets . We removed nails and cut the wood pallets to the proper size to fit our custom cabinet . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used the thicker pieces of wood from the 3 pallets for the back of our cabinet . <p> You can see the framing is finished and the front of our shelving unit has been assembled and attached . <p> Here we used the 3rd pallet wood for the very top portion of our cabinet . <p> The top of our shelf cabinet is attached and looking great . <p> Here is a closer look at the top of our pallet cabinet . We used nails to attach everything together . You can use wood screws if you want but we were trying to recycle everything . <p> We attached the inner shelf and the pallet cabinet is fully together . Now time to stain the wood ! <p> We used part of one of the pallets to elevate the cabinet so we could apply some red mahogany minwax stain . You will probably use the complete can of stain since the pallet wood is very porous . <p> Here is our custom wood pallet cabinet shelving unit fully finished . You can use any color of stain you choose but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get a long lasting finish . <p> NOTE FOR SAFETY : A wood pallet is industrial use wood . You MAY have the possibility of industrial contaminates on your pallet . The best pallet to use for any project will be marked HT for heat treated . If your pallet is marked CT that means it is chemically treated and you should try and search for an HT pallet instead . With any pallet , you can remove the danger of these POSSIBLE contaminates by simply hosing the wood down with water and cleaning / scrubbing with soap . After a good cleaning leave the pallet in the sun for a full day to fully dry out . Whatever project you are going to be doing with your pallet you can seal the wood first with any common wood sealer . REMEMBER it is a good idea to act as though all pallet wood needs to be sealed than to act like there is no possibility of danger . Especially when you 're going to be storing food near it or using it in a garden environment . Thank you for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? How long did this take ? Is it a relatively easy project ? I am rather inexperienced when it comes to woodworking , but am a college student with a small bedroom in an apartment that I am sharing with my boyfriend . We do not have a lot of clothing storage , but this would be perfect for the closet . Its hard to find something like this for cheap being sold , so I wanted to make it if it is an easy project that can be done within a month during the evenings and on some weekends . 
@@13196897 @1796897/ <h> How To Fix An Ice Maker That Stopped Working After Power Outage <p> Question : Recently my- refrigerator freezer ice maker stopped making ice cubes after a long power outage . It is the type of ice maker inside the freezer that just drops the cubes into a bin . I can hear it cycle but there are no ice cubes being produced . Everything else on the refrigerator is working properly . Is there something I can check or inspect before calling a repair person ? I need to save money so anything I can do myself to fix the problem would be helpful ! <p> Answer : FIRST and foremost There is usually an arm that moves up and down to turn the ice maker on and off . Make sure it is in the down position to make ice . If it is then there may be an on/off switch located on the ice maker itself . Make sure it is not off . <p> If the ice maker is on , then the issue is most likely caused by a frozen chunk of ice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freezer/fridge that should prevent this from happening , but sometimes after a power outage , this can happen . If you suspect this is what has happened to your ice maker , unplug the fridge from power , slide it out from the wall , and turn off the water supply on the wall . The frozen chunk of ice most likely will be in the water line inside the freezer . At this point you can remove the ice maker from inside the freezer so you can inspect it . It is usually held in place by a few Phillips screws . It will also be connected to a wire harness that needs to be unplugged before removal so use caution . Remove the ice maker and inspect it for any type of jam caused by a piece of ice that may have refroze after the power came back on . Is there anything blocking it from functioning normally ? If so , remove the ice blockage and set the ice maker aside . Now , look in the freezer and find where the water comes in to feed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line to see if there is a small chunk of ice blocking it . If so use a pointy object and remove it from the line . If you have found no ice blocking the water line , further troubleshooting is needed . <p> Another issue could be that your freezer is not getting to the proper temperature to let your ice maker produce ice . The inside of the freezer should be below 10 degrees F for the ice maker to function properly . If it has been only a short while since you have restored power , give the freezer at least 24 hours to get cold enough . It can also take around 48 hours to actually fill the ice bin . You can check the freezer temperature dial that should be located near the top of the inside of the refrigerator . <p> Lastly , when the power kicked back on , there may have been a voltage spike . A voltage spike may have burned up a component in the freezer or ice maker . If this is the case , it may be best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how a refrigerator/freezer works .

Hiring a contractor is one option but we are going to show you below how to remove a popcorn ceiling yourself . <p> 1 . Protect the floor and larger furniture with plastic drop cloths . Relocate small and medium sized items to be out of the way . Cover large items such as your couch or large furniture pieces with a drop cloth to avoid the material falling on them . <p> 2 . Using a spray bottle or pump sprayer , wet the ceiling texture to soften the aged material and minimize dust in the air while you remove the material . Do not soak the ceiling , just get it nice and damp . If you soak the ceiling with water it will damage the paper surface of the wallboard underneath . <p> 3 . Scrape the ceiling with smooth long strokes . Apply even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entire surface of the ceiling until the popcorn is gone . If your ceiling texture is painted then scrape off the top of the texture before wetting to expose the underlying surface . Then wet the surface once the painted material is gone . <p> 4 .

It would still turn on but the screen did not look right . We took it apart and laid it out in the sun for a few hours . It started working perfectly again except for the battery . We replaced the battery but within 4 days the phone stopped recognizing the SIM card . We opened the phone up and discovered that the SIM card contacts were slightly oxidized . The SIM card looked a little oxidized too so we decided to clean everything to be safe <p> To clean the SIM card contacts on your phone : First turn the phone completely off and remove the battery if possible . Use a Q-tip and some rubbing alcohol and clean any debris or oxidation off of the SIM slot contacts . Do n't  let the rubbing alcohol get everywhere inside you phone as this can damage it . Clean the SIM card and the SIM contacts until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Once the SIM and contacts are clean and dry , put the phone back together and turn the phone on . If the phone fails to recognize or read the SIM card , then most likely the actual SIM card has just simply gone bad .

Just go to the nearest store or kiosk and tell them your issue and 99% of the time they will install and setup a new SIM for you . <p> I have an iPhone 6S plus replica sometimes when i turn the off and back on it comes up with all this chinese writing and i have no idea what i have done .

I am pretty sure it had something to do with all that chinese writing i have pushed something and now i have no clues as what to do ? Can you please help . <p> Marina , If you have an iPhone 6 Knock-off or fake iPhone 6 made by a Chinese company with a Chinese name on the phone , then when you restart the phone it may show Chinese writing .

The best way to remove your cars interior ac odor is to use a cleaner that uses enzymes . Enzymes in cleaners kill odors at the source and completely kill the smelly substance material and therefore stopping the a bad smell . Do not use common household cleaners as most do not have enzymes and the majority are just heavily perfumed which only masks the smell . <p> How To Remove Smells From Your Cars A/C Vent System <p> REMOVING CIGARETTE SMOKE FROM A CARS INTERIOR : Cigarette smoke is probably the hardest of the smells to remove from your cars ac vents .

The air that comes into your car through the interior ac vents goes past the cars evaporator . Water condenses around the coils on the evaporator and the moisture on the evaporator makes it easy for harmful air particles , dust , dirt , pollen , spores and germs to enter your cars interior . These air particles form harmful and smelly substances such as bacteria , mites , and fungus . <p> Removing and replacing a dirty cabin air filter on your car can stop that bad smell <p> CHECK YOUR CARS REPLACEABLE CABIN AIR FILTER : Newer cars have an air filter inside the cabin of the car that removes bad smells from the air that comes into the car . You can look in your owners manual to find out if your car had a removable air filter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then remove and replace it with one that your car manufacturer recommends . Sometimes after replacing the dirty air filter that horrible smell can still be present . If the smell remains you can get your car an A/C and heating system cleaning . These A/C System Cleaners are sprayed into the exterior air intake vents ( located just underneath the windshield wipers ) and the inside the cars vents . These cleaners kill odors that are actually inside your cars ac vent system . <p> HOW TO CLEAN THE CARS AC VENT SYSTEM : First turn on the ac to full , make sure the " recirculate " button is not on , spray a large amount of cleaner with odor killing enzymes into the EXTERIOR air intakes that are located just below the windshield wipers , let the car run for about 10 minutes with the ac on , after 10 minutes turn off ac and spray the cleaner into the ac vents on the INSIDE of your car . After doing all this , let the car sit for 20 minutes turned off and windows rolled up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ car . By doing this you are killing the bacteria or mold in the car ac vent ducts and also the evaporator mold that may be present . <p> I had my car develop a SUDDEN smell in cabin when I put the air on ( not air conditioner ) , it was worse when was on cold . The smell started after I had the car hand washed . As the problem came suddenly I felt it was connected to the people in the car wash , so far it seems likely they sprayed water into the cat converter and screwed it up . The fact that it gets slightly better on heat suggests it is not heater core . Not sure how to resolve this , maybe a long journey to evaporate water and hopefully dry out cat converter , I could replace exhaust but still not sure of the source . <p> My Toyota Corolla 2015 started doin this from day 1 , I would get this pungent smell after my car set in the garage for a few hours .

I have n't did this due to it still under warranty . I did take it to the dealer and the sprayed a foam up the condensate drain line that they say will fix it but I just got that done today and havent checked it out yet . <p> Ray , Always try using not only a product that covers the odor but use an odor remover . You may have not changed your cars AC filter for awhile . Try changing that and see if it helps . Also there may be some mold or other stuff near where the air is pulled in from outside . Usually right below windshield . Check to be sure it is clean and no gunk is trapped near the air entrance . -RR

@@13196911 @1796911/ <h> Dishwasher Low Water Level What To Check <p> Our new Whirlpool dishwasher is not getting enough water to clean the dishes properly . The water pressure is either too low or it is simply not getting enough water . The dishes on the top rack seem to not even have any water cleaning them as they are just as dirty as when they were put in . We just installed this dishwasher ourselves about a week ago . Could an improper installation have something to do with it ? Could the water pressure be too low ? What would cause this ? Is it possible we installed the dishwasher incorrectly ? Do you have any suggestions about what we should check ? <p> If you have just recently installed your dishwasher , then we have a few reasons that may be the problem for low water pressure ( or not enough water ) in your dishwasher . <p> Possible ( Low Water Level ) Reason #1 When you installed your dishwasher you had to turn off the water shut off valve that is under your sink . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shut off valve . Check to be sure that the shut off valve is fully open . The shut off valve could also be clogged or not working properly . Check to be sure the valve is open and not clogged . <p> Dishwasher Not Filling With Water Properly <p> Possible ( Low Water ) Reason #2 The dishwasher drain hose may not have a loop in it . The fill water may be draining out of the dishwasher by going straight out the drain hose . Be sure that your drain hose is not simply laying straight . It must have a loop in it or be off the ground so the fill water ( dishwasher cleaning water ) is not gravity fed out via the drain hose . <p> Possible ( Low Water ) Reason #3 Empty the dishwasher , set it to run a wash cycle . Let it fill with water as normal . When the dishwasher begins the cycle , open the door and see where the water level is at . The water level SHOULD be just under the heating elements . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a small bucket with water and manually fill up the dishwasher water level to just below the heating elements . Now shut the door and let it run . If the top rack is now getting water to it , then yes you are not getting enough water to your dishwasher . You should have a 3/8 water line going to your dishwasher . This line is what supplies water to your dishwasher . There may be a clog in your water fill line or water inlet fill valve . Remove the fill line where it attaches to the fill valve . Check to be sure there is nothing clogging the screen on the inlet fill valve . At this time also check the water fill line for blockage . During install something may have fallen down and is blocking the water from flowing properly . <p> Possible ( Low Water ) Reason #4 The dishwasher has a water level switch ( aka overfill switch ) . This switch is usually on a simple float that sits at the very bottom of your dishwasher . Locate the float switch in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moving up and down freely . You can take the bottom service panel off and see the bottom portion of the plastic float . The bottom of the float pushes down on a small microswitch telling the dishwasher when to stop water flow . Be sure that the microswitch is not bent or out of place . <p> Possible ( Low Water ) Reason #5 The water inlet fill valve inside your dishwasher may not be working properly . You can test it using a multimeter . Even though the dishwasher is new , it is not out of the question that the inlet fill valve is defective . <p> Dishwasher Water Inlet Valve Testing <p> Possible ( Low Water ) Reason #6 Your home may normally have low water pressure . If this is the case , you may need to install a special low water pressure fill valve on your new dishwasher . You can test the water pressure in your home with a gauge . The average home has a water pressure from 20-120 PSIG . <p> Possible ( Low Water ) Reason #7 You may also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure there is nothing else that could be causing the low water issue . Also check under the sink for a possible kinked or restricted water line or hose . <p> The troubleshooting methods above will work on all types of dishwashers including Kitchenaid , Frigidaire , LG , GE , Whirlpool , Bosch , Amana , Kenmore , Samsung , and Maytag . <p> NOTE : Always think safety and disconnect power when working on appliances . <p> Do you know of another reason a dishwasher would have low water pressure ? Please leave a comment below . <p> We had a similar low water issue with our old ( last century ) Whirlpool dishwasher . Note that this fix may also apply to newer and or other brands . Problems were poor dish cleaning , little to no water at top rack and it did n't  sound right . When stopped and then restarted the water spray sound lasted only a few seconds , then quieted . Water level appeared low inside . <p> I had n't  found this site yet , so I estimated that the water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a little above the heating elements . Note that the above article says just below the element . Several pans of water brought it to this level and it sounded and worked much better . Our washer has a timed fill rather than a level fill . So I checked and found that running it through the timed fill cycle 2 1/2 times brought it to the right level . <p> I figured a plugged screen , so pulled off the solenoid fill valve to clean it . There was some crud on the screen but not much . I took the valve completely apart for a more thorough cleaning . Drawing a diagram and marking parts here helps for easier and faster reassembly . The culprit was under the filter screen , a flow restrictor with only a 3/32 hole for water flow . Rather than just remove it I drilled it out to 2 1/2 times the area which was 5/32 , hoping to match the above test results . <p> Success ! It filled to the bottom of the element , very close to what was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sounds like it should too . <p> So , you do n't  have to increase the fill time if you increase the flow rate by opening up the flow restrictor . <p> I also have a new whirlpool dishwasher acting similar . When it runs the motor makes funny noises . To me it sounds like its running dry at times due to not enough water . When I manually add water to the dishwasher say a couple-few large cups of water the noise goes away and dishes seem to come out cleaner . Water valve is open all the way and its a brand new water line 3/8 . Tested water valve and it seems to work fine . Water level is below the element . Its been doing this since the day it was installed . Anyone know if there is a way to increase the fill time ? <p> My whirlpool dishwasher has been making the " cavitating " sound for many years . The only way I can get it to quieten down , is to add one quart of extra water during each cycle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wash , pre rinse , and final rinse ) . The cavitating sound got severe , so I removed the water inlet valve and found the strainer was clogged with a lot of copper-looking scale flakes . After removing these flakes , the dishwasher is back to its original " cavitating " sound , which requires adding an additional quart of water during each cycle . I have found no way to reprogram the water inlet timing software ( I guess the number of seconds allowed for each water inlet time , is on a chip ) .

@@13196923 @1796923/ <p> Question : My air conditioner unit in my home runs just about constantly just to stay at 76 degrees . Do I need to add more freon ? Or do I need to replace my AC unit before summer gets here ? Help ! My electricity bill was over $350 dollars last month in April ! <p> Answer 1 It will depend on the temperature of inside your home and the outside air temperature and also how well your house is insulated . If you have vaulted ceilings and lots of big windows then this is something to consider . If there is cold air blowing from the vents then it may be doing all it can to keep it at 75 degrees . At times the AC Evaporator can get dirty from use . If this is dirty it will decrease the effectiveness of the AC unit temperature . You can try cleaning the evaporator coil with this cleaner here . <p> Answer 2 Throw the expensive restrictive return " pollen " home air filters away and put a cheap free flowing return filter on there instead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are very restrictive . The allergy catching filters are total gimmicks and are too restrictive for the normal A/C system . Or you can swap out your return grill to a huge size to make up for reduced airflow through the restrictive filters . Getting the cheap blue or green 99 cent filter is the cheapest way to improve your AC to not constantly run and to improve its effectiveness . <p> How often to change air filter for your AC unit in Summer <p> Answer 3 First of all The word " freon " is a brand name for a refrigerant named R-22 ( Refrigerant 22 ) . Other types of air conditioning refrigerants are called R-134a , R-404A , R-407C , R-12 and R-410A . Also the actual refrigerant that is named Freon was banned years ago . To be able to work with R-22 yourself you need to be certified by the EPA . ( If you want to know more about refrigerant info requirements from the EPA click here ) Anyway , your unit is probably undercharged ( not enough refrigerant ) or overcharged ( too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ company will come out and check the refrigerant with industrial gauges for about $30 dollars . Have them come out and check your A/C before you buy a new unit of course ! <p> Answer 4 A bigger air conditioner unit is not always better when it comes to HVAC equipment . The unit must be properly sized for the house it is going to be used on . There are many factors that go into a load calculation . Consider things like the number of windows in your home , the east and west sunshine exposure , and your homes insulation . If you do not get cold air out of the AC vents then you could have a refrigerant issue . Most people can not check this themselves so it is best if you call an Air Conditioning Technician . Have them come out and check your refrigerant to see if it needs to be filled . If you are a Groupon member there are usually great discounts on getting your AC checked to see if repairs are needed . You can also check your AC air filter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dirty AC air filter prevents air flow from going across your indoor evaporator coil . Remember to change your air filters every 30 days in the summer months . <p> Home A/C Air Conditioner Diagram <p> Answer 5 If you have approx 17 degrees difference between the supply air ( air going into the vent ) and the cold air coming out of the vents then there is nothing wrong with the unit itself . It just means it is so hot outside that your unit can not keep the temperature up . Check to make sure there are no windows open and that any sliding glass patio doors are not cracked open . Another thing to check is to make sure the sliding glass doors and windows in your house have a proper seal . Some seals on doors and windows will rip or come loose over time thus letting precious cold air escape outside . <p> Answer 7 If you know the basic workings of an A/C Take the cover off the condenser and see if anything may be blocking the flow of air . Use a Shop-Vac @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it out with a water hose . Also you can try this . If the blades of the fan are dirty or possibly slightly bent then straighten the blades out and clean them off . <p> My AC runs almost constantly , its June so its pretty hot out . The problem i noticed in particular is that the room temp by the thermostat barely comes down from 80 degrees F but the thermostat is set to 74 F to 75 F. So it just runs and runs trying to come down , but never does . The filter is clean and the condenser coils are relatively clean . <p> We have electric furnace with central air.The air is running constantly . Have to cut it off to give it a break . We live in a 16+80 mobile home and it did not do this before last year.The heat does fine.We had cool seal put on and the windows caulked.What now ?

I spent hours looking for parts at home depot and guessing what size parts to get . For example what size clamp connector to get . Choosing electrical wire was challenging . I have changed out switches in my house before and I have never used electrical cord on a switch . The wire from the electrical cord was just not hooking into the switch and did not look safe . So i used solid piece of copper wire for the outlet and the switch . FYI , check to make sure the switch fits in the junction box and that your lid is able to properly secure the switch and outlet into that box . I did n't  check and the project took longer than it should of . <p> This is great . I 'm no electrician , but this looks like something I can do . I would n't have that lampshade , though .

But concerning your question , if someone was to use a pressure treated wood to make a garden planter you can isolate pressure treated wood by lining the inside of the bed with heavy plastic to prevent leaching of chemicals from the wood into the soil . However . A pressure treated wood does in fact last much longer then untreated wood , so using it might mean fewer trees would be cut . So ..

@@13196954 @1796954/ <h> How To Fix And Prevent A Mold Problem In The Bathroom <p> A severe mold problem in your bathroom is commonly caused by excess moisture . Many times this is the result of a broken or nonworking bathroom vent exhaust fan . Whenever you take a hot shower in a small enclosed bathroom , moisture is produced . If that moisture is not being expelled out of the bathroom , the moisture has nowhere to go and will settle on the walls and ceiling . When this happens the walls and ceilings become wet and will attract rapid mold growth . <p> You will need to determine if your bathroom exhaust fan is working properly . Flip the switch on the wall and listen to determine if the exhaust fan is turning on . If you do not hear any noise , then most likely it is not working . You can carefully remove the vent cover and see if the fan is turning . If it is , then it may just be so full of dust and dirt that it has become inefficient . You can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make sure the fan is NOT on when doing this . Once the exhaust fan has been cleaned out , test it again to make sure it is operating efficiently . <p> In some cases ( many people taking a shower in a short period of time ) , you may need to upgrade your fan to something with a higher CFM ( cubic feet per minute ) to remove the moisture faster . You can determine the total cubic feet of your bathroom by taking the square footage X ceiling height to get the total cubic feet . Here is an example : A common bathroom measures 12 feet wide and 14 feet long and has 7 foot ceilings . The math is done to find cubic feet : 12 x 14 x 7 = 1176 cubic feet .

@@13196955 @1796955/ <h> How Do Pilots Communicate With Air Traffic Control ? <p> Have you ever wondered what all those different terms a pilot says when he is flying and communicating with air traffic control ? We will show you exactly how a pilot communicates and why they use all those different words when talking on the radio . We have a list of how each letter is represented in word form , and a list of pilot and ATC terms . Have a look at the information below to help you to decipher what pilots are saying over the radio . NOTE : When you see the letters ATC below , it stands for Air Traffic Control . <p> Aviation ( pilots and ATC ) have their own special vocabulary . Mostly all letters that are relayed over radio are spoken in word form . To say the letter " R " it is relayed as " Romeo " . For example , if an air traffic controller tells a pilot to turn on taxiway 3C , it would be relayed as Three Charlie . If a pilot is using @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ATC his aircraft number ( call sign ) , for example if the number was 9394N , it would be communicated to ATC as Nine Three Nine Four November . This is to help pilots and air traffic control to fully understand each other and avoid errors in otherwise simple communications . <p> If you are interested in listening to Live Air Traffic Control , visit the website LiveATC for the best streaming audio . <p> Example of Pilot to ATC communication:Aircraft : Los Angeles Tower , three seven charlie ( 37C ) , holding short of two three right.Tower : Three seven charlie , Los Angeles Tower , runway two three right , cleared for immediate takeoff.Aircraft : Roger , three seven charlie , cleared for immediate takeoff , two three right . <p> Who controls all these Aviation rules ? : The International Civil Aviation Organization ( ICAO ) is the agency that controls worldwide aviation . The ICAO has chosen English as the official language of all aviation . This makes communication much easier in a large worldwide air transportation system . Everything relating to aviation is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ language , runway markings , taxiway markings , radio frequencies , etc <p> How are all the letters in aviation pronounced ? : Pronouncing letters and numbers can be easily misunderstood such as hearing an " E " for a " D " . Since this can cause confusion , thus leading to accidents , letters and numbers in aviation are spoken using the International Aviation Phonetic Alphabet . This alphabet substitutes an entire word to represent one single letter . The first letter of a particular word is the letter of the alphabet it is representing . For example if ATC needs to communicate the letter " K " , it would be spoken as a complete word using the word " Kilo " . See below for the complete aviation/pilots alphabet . <p> If you are interested in buying aviation manuals , purchasing them online can be the least expensive . <p> What about some of the other terms used in Aviation ? : ATC ( air traffic control ) instructions to pilots usually consist of keywords followed by specific numbers . As an example , " turn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number . The " Pilot and Controller Glossary " is the USAs official guide for the " correct words . " Here are a few specific words that you may hear over ATC radio audio frequencies . <p> ABORT = To terminate a preplanned aircraft maneuver <p> ACTIVE RUNWAY = Runway in use <p> AFFIRMATIVE = Yes <p> AIRSPEED = To communicate the speed of your aircraft <p> AIR TRAFFIC = Aircraft operating in the air or on an airport surface <p> BLOCKED = Used to indicate that a radio transmission has been interrupted <p> CLEARED FOR TAKEOFF = ATC has authorized an aircraft to depart <p> CLEARED FOR THE OPTION = ATC authorization for an aircraft to make action at discretion of pilot <p> CLEARED TO LAND = ATC authorization for an aircraft to land <p> CLOSED TRAFFIC = Operations involving takeoffs and landings or low approaches when the aircraft does not exit the traffic pattern <p> EXPEDITE = Used by ATC when prompt compliance is required <p> FLY HEADING = Informs the pilot of the heading they need to fly <p> FUEL REMAINING = Used by pilots or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ GO AROUND = Instructions for a pilot to stop his approach to landing <p> HAVE NUMBERS = Used by pilots to inform ATC that they have received information <p> IDENT = A request for a pilot to activate the aircraft transponder identification <p> IMMEDIATELY = Used by ATC when an action is required to avoid an imminent situation <p> LINE UP AND WAIT = Used by ATC to inform a pilot to taxi onto the departure runway to line up and hold <p> MAINTAIN = Means to remain at the altitude or flight level specified <p> MAKE SHORT APPROACH = Used by ATC to inform a pilot to alter his traffic pattern to make a short final approach <p> MAYDAY = The international radio telephony distress signal <p> MINIMUM FUEL = Indicates that aircraft fuel supply has reached a state where little or no delay is required <p> NEGATIVE = That is not correct <p> NEGATIVE CONTACT = Used by pilots to inform ATC that the previously issued traffic is not in sight <p> OVER = I have finished talking <p> RADAR CONTACT = Used by ATC to inform an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ RADAR SERVICE TERMINATED = Used by air traffic control to inform a pilot that they will no longer be provided any of the services that can be received while in radar contact <p> STAND BY = The controller or pilot must pause for a few seconds to attend to higher actions <p> TRAFFIC = A term used by ATC to refer to one or more aircraft <p> TRAFFIC IN SIGHT = Used by pilots to inform a controller that issued traffic is in sight <p> UNABLE = Indicates inability to comply with a specific instruction <p> VERIFY = Request confirmation of info <p> WILCO = Will comply <p> What does it mean when ATC tells a pilot a " heading " ? : A heading means what direction of flight . When ATC instructs an aircraft or pilot to turn to a certain heading , this number relates to the pilots aircraft heading indicator and shows what direction to go . This indicator is basically a compass . All heading numbers will consist of 3 numbers . Flying North would be a heading of 360 . Flying East would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heading of 180 . Flying West would be a heading of 270 . It is very simple if you just picture a compass pointing North in your mind . If the ATC tower tells the pilot to turn to a heading of 140 , that would be a Southeast direction .

Finding out or calculating how many BTUs you need to properly cool a room with a Portable AC or Window Air Conditioner is critical . To properly cool a room with any type of air conditioner , you need to know the square footage of the room you are going to cool . Use the chart below to find out EXACTLY how many BTUs you need to air condition or cool a room . <p> The first thing you need to do is determine the square footage of the room you are going to cool . Measure the rooms LENGTH X WIDTH- and you will have the square footage of the room .

The BTU chart values assume that the AC in your room will be set at 72 degrees F. The chart is expressing the maximum cooling ability of the unit . The chart gives you recommendations for a 100% duty cycle which means the AC unit is ON all the time . See below for other factors to consider when calculating BTUs to cool a room . <p> Here are some other factors you need to take into consideration when figuring out BTUs for a room : Are there sources of heat in the room , such as a fridge , TV , entertainment centers , etc ? Are there large windows in the room ? Will the AC unit be located in the center of the room , near @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exterior doors are in the room ? Is the room or area insulated ? How many walls in the room are exterior walls and facing the sun ? <p> No BTU chart or formula can give an exact BTU rating required for an area or room . A room or area needing cooled may have other factors involved . Things such as large windows , bad insulation , and walls that face the exterior and exposed to the sun can make the room hotter . Because of these factors , you can choose an AC unit that produces more cooling . In these circumstances , you can go up 30% or more to get maximum cooling for the area needed . Do not go too high up on the BTUs as it is possible to have too much cooling for a given area and an air conditioning unit can freeze up . <h> What does BTU stand for and the meaning ? <p> BTU refers to the units of measure = British Thermal Units . The British Thermal Unit , or BTU , is an energy unit . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 Fahrenheit . This is the measure for the cooling and heating of a room.1 BTU = 1,055 joules1 BTU per hour = 0.293 watts <p> An example of square footage to BTU is : A 1,000 square foot home with proper insulation in Ohio needs a 20,000 to 25,000 BTU air conditioner for proper cooling in the summer . If there are factors such as the sun hitting the home on the roof and walls all day , large windows in the home , the efficiency of the homes insulation , things in the home creating heat such as a refrigerator , dishwasher , computers , etc These factors will change the home on an individual basis and a higher BTU may be needed . <p> Below are examples of Window mounted Air Conditioners and Portable Air Conditioners with different BTU ratings .

At times , a water pipe in my house will freeze and in the past even had some pipes burst . It can happen either with a Hot or Cold water pipe . Some of the water pipes are running along the walls and towards the outside of my home and some of the pipes are in crawlspaces . What is the easiest way to make sure pipes do n't  freeze during the winter ? <p> Here is how water pipes freeze and can sometimes burst : When the weather is below freezing the water in the pipes expand when it freezes . As the frozen water is expanding it adds pressure on the pipes and can cause them to break , burst , crack , or swell . This causes problems as water will not flow through the pipes and the pipes may crack or burst and can cause your home to flood . Freezing pipes can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exposed to cold air are more likely to freeze at these temperatures . The easiest way to prevent this is to wrap all of the pipes with heavy pipe insulation . <h> Here are some easy ways to keep your pipes from freezing : <p> Stop Freezing Pipes 1 Use a simple but effective product called " Tube Pipe Insulation " . This tube insulation keeps the water pipes " insulated " which protects them from the freezing temperature from reaching into the water pipe and freezing it . Insulating your water pipes slows the heat from leaving the water in the pipes and freezing is more unlikely to occur . Any type of insulation for water pipes will work to help them from freezing . Just be sure to get the best recommended pipe insulation depending on the degree of cold temperature you live in . The colder the area , the thicker higher quality- water pipe insulation wrap or tubing you should use . <p> Water Pipe Insulation Heat Tape Tubing Fiberglass <p> Stop Freezing Pipes 2 Keep the cold temperature away by " insulating the space the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pipes are located should be insulated . Insulate cold " open " areas where the temperature can be freezing therefore helping to prevent the pipes from freezing . Insulating the pipes and the open areas is the best way to protect the pipes from freezing . <p> Stop Freezing Pipes 3 Slightly open up a faucet at the farthest part of the plumbing . If you can keep the water flowing it will do a great deal to prevent the pipes from freezing . This works as it constantly introduces relatively warmer water into the pipes and this prevents them from cooling to below the frost or freezing point . NOTE : This is usually needed to be done if you are not living in the home during cold weather as water is not being used if no one is occupying the home . <p> Stop Freezing Pipes 4 Consider installing other types of insulation depending on the actual temperature or if you own a second home and the home is not occupied . Meaning no one is using water and no water if flowing through the pipes . Research @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Insulating products that will work better than just the Tube Pipe Insulation is a product called Heat Tape and Pipe Heating Cables . Find the best solution for the situation and temperature and find other insulating materials for exposed water pipes or when water is not being used in the home meaning water is not flowing in the pipes . <p> Pipe Heating Cable with Thermostat <p> Stop Freezing Pipes 5 Be sure to insulate all water pipes that go through unheated garages , attics , and under crawlspaces . These areas are sometimes forgotten and may freeze or burst . It is best to insulate the complete area to keep the cold temperature from getting in these areas . When the heat tape or tube pipe insulation is added , the pipes are safe from freezing . <p> Stop Freezing Pipes 6 If you are not living in the home ( vacant ) and you are having a freezing pipes problem , another way is to attempt to DRAIN THE WATER OUT OF THE WATER PIPES . Run all water faucets and flush toilets . Open the drain faucet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off the water main valve to your home . Attempt to flush the water out of all the water pipes in your unoccupied home . When this is done , leave the outside drain faucet cracked open a small amount to allow all water to flow out of the pipes . If there is no water in the pipes , then they can not freeze . Keeping the complete home heater on at a reasonable temperature when doing this will also help . <p> Do you have better methods for preventing water pipes from freezing ?

You can by building this bed yourself and adding a string of LED rope lights to the bottom . The wood for this project will cost around $300 dollars depending on where you purchase it from . The time it will take you to build this will be from 2 to 4 days . This woodworking project can be for a twin , full , queen , or king bed . The dimensions of this bed will vary depending on your mattress size . The top frame portion of the bed will be the dimensions of your mattress . The bottom frame portion will be 1ft shorter on the sides and front to hide the bottom frame from view and give the look of a " floating " bed . See below for the step by step pictures . <p> I am not any sort of construction person , by no means at alland I am fixing to make this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the top frame sliding or slipping across the bottom frame ? If so , would it be best to just anchor the two together somehow ? And mine will be on glossy tile , so I am going to place some sort of traction tape on the bottom frame so it does not slip on the floor . Any suggestions ? <p> Jim , Yes anchoring the 2 together would be a good idea . Anchor one in the front portion and one in the back and the bed can not slip . The traction tape is a good idea as you have glossy floors . If you use high quality heavy wood most of your concerns will be solved . -RR <p> I just finished this bed and I love it , looks awesome and alot cheaper than buying a nice solid wood bed at the store . Altogether I have about $300 into it not including the mattess and I worked on it a little every night for 2 weeks after I got off work . Fun project and will be making some floating night stands to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a 2+6 top for extra height and it worked well . Bought the lights at wall mart for about 30 bucks . And went with fir 2+6 and 2+10 , and cedar 1+6 for everything else since oak was $6 a foot . But looks nice and am happy with the outcome . <p> Not sure some folks should attempt this project after seeing their questions , but seriously , good luck to everyone . The IMPORTANT question is , how well does the mattress stay on the bed ? if you were to get even just sleep restlessly as I do , is there a chance it will slide around ? or does it seem secure ? I have a regular bed but planning on something like this on my current I have one of the anti slip mats you would use under a rug between the box springs and mattress , I guess that would help here to if needed ? ? <p> What is the bill of material for a queen and king size floating bed frame ; i.e. , how many 2+4s , how many 2.6 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , type and qty of required hardware ? Is there a dimensioned plan available ? <p> Hi Nick , A " Full " mattress is 54 " x 75 " ( inches ) . You will obviously have to make the bed frame bigger than the actual mattress size . We would recommend making the frame only a few inches wider ( on the sides , front , back ) without having too much of the wood frame hanging off the sides . If there is excessive width to the frame , it will just be something you hit your knees on constantly . Build the top portion of the frame first ( where the mattress will be sitting ) . Next construct the bottom portion . When you build the bottom portion be careful with how wide and how long you make it . Remember , it needs to be the proper size to support the bed when someone is sleeping or sitting on the very edge of the bed ( so it does not tip over ) . At the same time you do n't  want it to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of " floating " . -RR <p> Just a suggestion If you were to wrap the lower bed support with mirror tiles or some el cheapo wall mirrors , it would add to the floating effect as the floor covering would be reflected . Basic magic trick stuff . Would probably increase the light effect as well .

What is the best way- to let a washing machine- drain the water in my garage when I am washing clothes ? I can install the washer next to the utility sink in the garage . If I do this , can I let the washer drain into the sink ? If so how ? If not , do I need a special part to let it drain in a more permanent way to avoid flooding or leaking ? <p> Answer:If you can install your washing machine in the garage and next to a utility sink , then yes you can let it drain into the sink . You can install a bracket or wire ties on the back of the sink so the washer drain hose is permanently attached to the sink . You may need a special drain hose depending on the distance of the washer to the sink . ( If the utility sink overflows with water , use a homemade filter on the end of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Washing Machine Drain Hose To Utility Sink <p> Once you have the drain hose installed on the utility sink , add a homemade filter to the end of the drain hose ( where the waste water comes out ) such as a pair of pantyhose or an old sock . You may need to use a large hose clamp to keep the filter in place . The homemade filter is used so no lint gets into your sink drain . This prevents the sink from being clogged with lint or other items flowing from the washers drain hose . Depending on how often you use your washing machine , be sure to remove the homemade filter every 60 days or so and clean it or replace it . There may also be a drain pump debris filter located on the front of the machine at the bottom of the washer . This needs to be cleaned out on a regular basis to avoid it from being clogged and therefore the drain pump can not pump water out . <p> NOTE : Depending on the type of washing machine and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the drain hose If you mount the washing machine drain hose onto the edge of the sink , the water pressure may be so high that the sink could overflow . This will depend on the size of the sink and the pressure of the drain pump on the washer . Test to see if there is a possibility of the sink overflowing when the washing machine drains . If not , you can leave it as is . If it overflows , you may need to install the drain hose into the sink drain using a Y-fitting for a more permanent solution . ( Or another type of drain fitting depending on your specific layout ) <p> Washer Drain Hose To Utility Sink <h> Other options for washing machine drainage in garage : <p> 1 - Install the drain hose into an installed 2 ? diameter drainage stand pipe .

A smaller drain line will not be acceptable for the volume of water pumped out of the washer . If the pipe is not 2 ? in diameter , a P-trap and a stand pipe must be installed to prevent any water from backing up and overflowing . <p> If you know easier ways to connect your washing machine to a utility sink in the garage , please leave a comment below .

I do not know if I am correct but I heard in the past that if I use a power strip instead of plugging one plug into each wall socket , it is cheaper . For instance , if I plug in one surge protector power strip with 4 outlets on it , then I plug in 4 of my electrical devices to the power strip , the power being used is the same as only one electrical device . This makes sense to me because you only have one electrical device plugged into the wall . Is this right or am I thinking wrong ? Please explain why I am wrong if I am . <h> Will My Electric Bill Be Lower If I Use A Power Strip ? <p> Answer:Your assumption is incorrect . Its technically cheaper ( and the same electricity usage ) to plug a device directly into a wall outlet . Plugging in 4 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fan , a monitor , and a light , will use the same amount of electricity the exact same way as if you plugged them into wall outlets separately . When using a power strip , even though you only have one plug going into the wall outlet , all 4 devices will use the same power as normal . The power for the 4 devices ( when plugged into a power strip ) all flow through one outlet . The ONLY true difference in power usage would be if your power strip has a light that indicates " on " . The electricity consumed by whatever you have plugged in is exactly the same in either case . However it is safer to use a power strip when it comes to protecting your gear , see below . <p> You can save electricity by using power strips correctly:Any device with a small transformer will pull a small electrical current when it is energized . Some call this standby power or vampire power . Some devices have internal transformers . Things like your television , computer , and monitor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the prongs that are inserted in the outlet . These boxes contain a transformer , so it will draw current when energized . The ON/OFF switch on the power strip turns off electric flow to ALL devices plugged into it , but the power strip itself ( prongs , wires , etc. ) is plugged into the wall , meaning that it makes an electrical connection and , therefore , pulls some " phantom load " electricity into itself.To save money using a power strip , turn the power strip off when you are not using any of the components plugged into it . This way there is no electrical trickle going to any of the plugged in transformers . By doing this , it will save you some money in electric bills . <p> Important information to consider about power strips:The power strip is used for safety and also lack of power outlets . Computer and Home Entertainment owners should understand the benefits of a good quality power strip . A quality power strip will protect against lightning strikes and electrical surges . <p> How many joules do I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is in joules . Joules tells you how much energy the surge protector can absorb before it will fail . A higher number indicates better protection . Find a surge protector that is at least rated at 200 to 600 joules . This will guarantee your components like TV and computer will be safe if a surge happens . <p> Can a storm or lightning damage my computer or TV ? : It is a fact that lightning can travel underground for nearly 1.5 miles which can cause power surges and electrical spikes from the power poles to your home . A power strip can also be effective when there is a loss of power and then the power quickly turns back on . To protect your computers , TVs and other valuable devices , get a high quality power strip that will save your expensive electronics . Be sure it has a surge protector so if the power from the outlets surge , the power strip will turn off and protect your electronics .
