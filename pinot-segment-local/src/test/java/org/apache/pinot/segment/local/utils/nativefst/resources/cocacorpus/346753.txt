We hope you find this information helpful as you plan your trip to Chapel Hill . You are so special to us &amp; we ca n't wait to celebrate our " Big Day " with each &amp; every one of you ! <h> Us <h> How It All Began <p> ( First picture taken together at a friend 's wedding ) <p> Jon and Courtney were a match made in heaven ... err , more like a match made on the Internet ! They met on Match.com in September , 2014 . Courtney had just experienced her first whirlwind summer of online dating but had not yet found " the one " and was about ready to give up . Enter Jon . Jon sent Courtney a message showing his interest and after a few back-and-forths , Jon asked Courtney for her number and on a date to one of her favorite spots , Fullsteam Brewery in Durham . Two days before the big date , Courtney 's phone rang @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Courtney always avoids answering an unknown number ( and sometimes known numbers - sorry ! ) so , per the usual , she let it go to voicemail . She quickly listened to the message and could n't believe her ears - this Jon fellow had actually called ! You see , all girls know the possibility of a guy calling you is about zilch in the technological days of now so this was pretty monumental . Jon just wanted to know how Courtney 's week was going and expressed his excitement about meeting her on Friday . Right away , something told Courtney this guy was different than all the others . <p> Courtney and Jon met up that Friday and chatted on the outside patio for hours over a few beers . They talked about everything from work , to hobbies , to family , and beyond . Courtney learned Jon had lived in Nashville before moving back to Chapel Hill . Jon learned Courtney had a crazy pet cat named George . Around 10:00 P.M. , Courtney mentioned that she was getting tired and was ready to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " man , this girl must not be interested , " but he took the plunge anyway and asked her out for a second date on the spot . She said she would love to go out again and the rest is history . Jon would later learn that Courtney can fall asleep at the drop of a hat and considers sleeping a respected art form so he no longer takes it personally when she yawns at inopportune times . Oh , and that first voicemail ... Courtney still has it and her stomach flutters whenever she listens to it : ) <h> The Answer is YES ! <p> ( Right after asking the Big Question ! ) <p> Jon had been thinking about asking Courtney to marry him for months but he really wanted the proposal to be a surprise . He had the ring since the beginning of March but with his crazy work schedule , he decided to wait and pop the big question in May when things had settled down a bit . He soon determined that May 21st would be the day to do it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weeks before the planned day , Jon had been telling Courtney he wanted them to take a long hike and/or have a picnic together . He even went and scoped out numerous spots on the sly ! Jon and Courtney are usually pretty laid back about their weekend plans , so Courtney thought something might be up when Jon kept expressing his concern for the upcoming rainy weather . To avoid any weather concerns , Jon came up with a " Plan B " and asked Courtney to spend the day with him at Fearrington Village in Pittsboro . He planned to propose at a nice dinner there that evening . The morning of the engagement , Jon picked Courtney up and they went to one of their favorite brunch spots , Elmo 's Diner . Jon knows banana pancakes are the way to Courtney 's heart . The weather ended up beautiful so they headed to Fearrington Village after breakfast . They walked around for a bit and then sat on a bench across from the pond . Courtney propped herself up against Jon and began to ponder aloud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She could feel Jon 's heart began to beat faster and faster so she looked at him , and he just could n't hold it in any longer . He looked right at her and told her there was something he had been wanting to tell her and ask her for a while . He told Courtney she was the most beautiful woman he had ever known on the inside and out and could n't imagine spending the rest of his life with anyone but her . He got down on one knee , and through tears , asked her to marry him . Courtney 's tearful but ecstatic response was " Of course ! Yes , Yes ! " They celebrated with phone calls to friends and family , an extraordinarily large glass of wine , and burgers and fries that evening . It rained for a bit that night but left a beautiful rainbow in its path - a sign Courtney and Jon take as a special blessing from God .

Our marriage contract is technically a Brit Ahuvim ( see " Establishing Our Partnership " below , for more information in the difference ) . The text of the contract describes our commitment to each other and our promises for our future life . Like any legal document , it is signed by , and in the presence of , witnesses . The signing will occur privately before the ceremony begins . <p> Officiants <p> Jewish weddings are officiated by rabbis , sometimes along with a cantor ( a singer and prayer-leader ) . We are delighted that Rabbi Leonard Gordon and Cantor Becky Wexler Khitrik will be officiating our wedding . <p> Circling <p> After the wedding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , symbolizing the creation of a new family circle and forming a " wall " of protection for the groom . These seven circles also parallel the seven wedding blessings , the seven days of creation , and the seven places in the Torah referring to the joining of husband and wife . In order to emphasize the equal footing of our union , Stephanie will first circle Dov three times . Following that , Dov will circle Stephanie three times . We will complete the last circle together . This circling symbolizes the creation of a new and protective home and the intertwining of our lives . <p> The Huppah <p> The huppah , a wedding canopy created with four pieces of wood and a square of cloth , creates an intimate , sanctified space symbolizing the home that we will share together . The sides are left open to signify that all friends and family are welcome into our new life and home . The cloth in our huppah was embroidered by Stephanie 's bubbi , whose spirit we intend to weave into our new family , along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longer with us . The ancient rabbis compared the huppah to the tent of Abraham , found in the biblical story .

Like our relationship , the huppah is stabilized by dear friends , who we trust to help create our new home , each of whom has held us up in one way or another . <p> Establishing our Partnership <p> The traditional Jewish wedding draws on the legal act of purchase as the central metaphor . That metaphor did n't feel right to us , so we 've decided to marry using the relatively newer tradition of Brit Shutafut . Like the traditional Jewish ceremony , its central purpose is to publicly bind two people into a special relationship . However , the Brit Shutafut 's central metaphor is one of partnership : Dov and Stephanie will symbolically demonstrate the formation of their partnership by each placing something of value from their life into a small bag .

The seven blessings reflect on the creation of the world and humankind , the importance of marriage , and a hope for harmony in the world . We 've asked loved ones to give readings during this part of the ceremony , to represent the communal nature of the celebration . The blessings will then be recited in Hebrew . <p> The Breaking of the Glass <p> The wedding ceremony ends with the breaking of a glass , which symbolizes the destruction of the second Temple in Jerusalem , and continues to remind us that even in times of great joy , there is still brokenness in the world .

For those of you traveling from Australia , there is no direct flight from Melbourne to Belgrade , therefore the approximate duration of the whole trip is between 20 -25h , usually with one stop in UAE - Abu Dhabi/Dubai , depending on the airline . <p> VISA INFORMATION <p> For our international friends traveling from EU or Australia , please see link below for the Visa requirements for Serbia . <p> We recommend that you find a place in Belgrade CBD ( it 's called Stari Grad ) as it is the most convenient location to easily visit most tourist attractions in the city . Wedding venue at Kosutnjak forest is about 15-20 minutes drive from Belgrade CBD so it 's going to be easy to reach it on the day of the wedding ( there is also a direct bus line from Stari Grad to Kosutnjak ) .

@@76690940 @5390940/ <h> How to Use Rules for RSVP <h> RSVP Form Rules <h> Overview <p> Rules provides a way for your RSVP form to perform certain actions like hiding and showing a field based on a condition . This gives you a flexible way to customize the form to perform actions based on the input . <h> Starting <p> To access the rules feature , click on the RSVP page in your Dashboard . After you click on the " Edit RSVP " button , you 'll see a button for " Rules " . <h> Rule Basics <p> Rules are made up of Conditions and Actions . The condition is how the rule will be matched in order to take action . It 's only when a condition is met where the action will actually take place . <h> Conditions <p> Your condition is based on your form fields . Each condition contains one of the fields from your form , a comparison and a value . In the example above , the conditions are using the " Your full name " field . It is chosen to use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our value which is " Jane Williams " and " Diana Lee " . The comparison options are " is " , " is not " , " includes " , and " excludes " . Each comparison is described as follows : <p> " is " will match exactly the value <p> " is not " will match if the value is not what the guest inputs <p> " includes " will partially match on the given value <p> " excludes " will match if it does n't contain the value as a subset <p> You can have as many conditions as you need per rule . The rule can either match when all the conditions apply or only when 1 of the conditions match . <h> Actions <p> An action will either " HIDE " or " SHOW " a given form field . You can have multiple actions per rule . When a rule is set up to " HIDE " , then the field will be displayed until the condition is met . When the condition is matched , then the field will be hidden . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SHOW " , only when the condition matches , then the field will actually be displayed . Otherwise , the field will be hidden . <p> Please note : when you take action on the same field in multiple rules , you 'll have issues and the rules wo n't work properly because we are checking all the rules . <h> Adding Rules <p> To add a rule , simply click on the " Add Rule " button to get started . <h> Adding a Condition <p> Each rule will have at least 1 condition . You can have many more conditions . To add a condition on a respective rule , click on the " Add Condition " button . <h> Customizing the Condition <p> You can change what field you would like to check . And you change the comparison used and also what value you 'd like to check . <h> Removing a Condition <p> If you 've added multiple conditions , you can remove any of them by clicking on the red " x " button . <h> Adding an Action <p> Each rule will have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many actions as you need . <h> Removing an Action <p> Similar to removing a condition , you can remove an action if you press the red " x " next to the action . <h> Examples <h> Limit +1 guests <p> A common rule our customers have been looking for is a way to limit +1 RSVPs from certain guests . The following example will help you to set your own rule : <p> The basic concept here is you 'll want a list of designated guests that are allowed to bring a +1 . All other guests not included will never see the +1 guest fields . This will allow you to control who can bring a +1 . <p> Our conditions are saying that if any guest is one of the three guests that matches the names above , then we 'll show them the " Are you bringing a guest ? " and " Your guest 's full name " fields . If a guest types in their name that is n't one of the 3 above , then they wo n't ever see the +1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that are allowed to bring a +1 by clicking on the " Add Condition " button which will allow as many guests as you need . <h> Show corresponding fields based on choice <p> Let 's say you wanted to show a number of guest name fields based on a dropdown of choices . In our example above , we want to show a corresponding number of fields if a guest chooses to bring 1,2,3 or 4 guests . Here 's how you set up your form : <p> You can add a " Dropdown " field to denote the number of choices . In our example above , we allow the guest to choose from 0 to 4 guests . If they do choose to bring at least 1 guest , then we want to show the corresponding fields to capture the guest information . <p> Here 's how to set up the rules for it : <p> We need to have a separate rule for each number of guest because we can only reference a single action field per rule .

Since I had never visited Chicago , I did not know what to expect as part of my visit , nor was I looking for anything special .

All I could think was , Wow what a coincidence , ca n't pass up this opportunity ! I proceeded to pull out her chair and complemented her dress . I was also very impressed with her hair , loved the natural look that was n't an afro puff or basic lion mane hair do that you see quite often . I proceeded to strike up basic conversation but the whole time I was also being interrupted by another woman that may have had her eyes on me . <p> As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engaging but going nowhere due to the fact that the other woman gave me her number , without me asking .

For which she replied , " What kind of friend are you ? " I laughed it off and said that it was nice meeting her and that she was a very beautiful woman . I knew that it would n't be proper to get her number , but some how felt that I was missing out on someone special . <p> That said , my game must have been on point , because she followed me out of the building @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

Angelo laughed at her ridiculousness then said he had one more surprise in store - champagne on ice at a bar nearby where they could call family and friends to share the good news .

The whole while , fielding calls in front of her , hoping that the secret would n't get out or that I would give things away by not ignoring the calls . As time crept closer to the radio announcement , it dawns on me , 20 minutes before the announcement , that I had not chosen a suitable location to propose to TaMara .

The sex therapist was quite entertaining , even to the point that she was not ashamed of speaking candidly in regards to specific details of human sexuality and sex acts . All that I could think of at the moment , was ough my , TaMara 's Granny is listening to this broadcast as we speak .

But this was not such an occasion , she is my one and only , so we are taking this day back for all of the couples . ) <p> And as for that random church parking lot where we ended up , it actually was n't as random as I had thought . Because God had given me a vision of the place where it would happen and in the middle of my mad dash , I did n't notice until the smoke had cleared , that this was the place and how things were supposed to be . <p> God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my back the whole time ! <p> Most importantly , TaMara was hyped and turned up the whole 5 hour trip home , not missing a beat .

Have I ever played poker ? No . Do I have way better things to worry about ? Of course . So I sit on the floor and talk on my phone the whole night , while this guy Fady , whom I 'd never met , actually plays poker . I 'm guessing at some point we must have talked that night , because soon after , Fady and I sparked a friendship that would prove to be unbreakable . <p> What 's this have to do with Greys ? That was our " thing " from the start ! Thursday nights . Every week . Greys , hookah , and Alaskan Amber beers at Fadys apartment . He loved Meredith ; I loved McDreamy- naturally ! Greys Anatomy nights turned into movie nights on other days of the week , and then we started doing things like playing the guitar at Titlow Beach , studying , and going to the gym together . I could honestly say I had never had a friend before him that I enjoyed being around SO much , and we were inseparable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; In our eyes , we were JUST friends , BEST friends , and nothing more . I had never met anyone that I clicked with so well and whom I felt so comfortable with . <p> Eventually , we saw what everyone else saw , and we decided to give romance a shot . It did n't  last , for many reasons , but mainly because we were young and nanve and had a lot of life to experience before becoming the people we are today ! We went our separate ways , lived our lives to the fullest and knew that if it was meant to be , it would happen ! <p> Flash forward 7 years : <p> Two years ago , I came home for summer break from Vietnam , and decided to see if Fady wanted to join me and a friend for the world cup soccer game , USA vs . Portugal . I truly expected him to say no , he was busy , maybe next time , yada yada- BUT He accepted ! ( Little did I know that before meeting me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Peak and rode his bicycle all the way to downtown Seattle to meet me . No big deal . ) Within hours , we realized it was like time had never passed , and we were as comfortable together then as we were 7 years before . <p> We decided to do a year of long distance , and made it work , with plenty of adventures along the way ! Whether it is cliff-jumping in Hawaii , diving WWII ships in Philippines , driving mopeds in Vietnam , or watching sunrise lightning storms over our Bali jungle villa pool , we share a love of adventure and travel , and I cant wait to see where life takes us . : ) <p> They say if things are meant to be , they will beand I could n't believe this to be any more true . <h> Our Story- According to him <p> I 'm very lucky to remember the exact moment I met Alisha .

When I first saw Alisha , she looked very pretty ; one of the reasons I remember this moment so well . The other reason might have had to do with the her laying on the kitchen floor talking on the phone It was with her boyfriend at the time . They are no longer together as far as I know . I 'm not all that surprised . The phone call did n't seem to be going well . With no boyfriend in sight , the door for me and Alisha to meet opened . <p> From there , and over the months to come , something amazing happened . A very natural and genuine friendship developed . We had the chance to get to know and like each other with no expectations . We were best friends . Every time we were together it was a blast . We ended dating for 2 months and we decided to go our separate ways . We stayed in touch over the years and we would catch up from time to time . <p> In 2014 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invited me to a USA world cup game in downtown Seattle . I gladly accepted . I had just got a new road bike that I was very excited about and it was nice and sunny out . I rode my bike from my old apartment on Dexter to Pioneer Square area to watch the game in an outdoor beer garden . We had an amazing time together like we always had . We had fully lived our 20s and our time to meet again was perfect . <p> The past 3 years with Alisha have been an adventure . We dated long distance and we had a lot of fun doing so , we hiked mountains together and camped in the freezing cold , we traveled to 6 countries together , and most importantly , we got to know each other 's family and friends whom we both love dearly .

Perhaps as many as half of visitors from lower elevations experience some form of altitude illness . The vast majority of cases spontaneously resolve as the body acclimates . Symptoms include fatigue , decreased appetite , shortness of breath with minimal exertion , nausea , headache and sleep disturbances . These symptoms are sometimes worse the second day at altitude ( but resolve 48-72 hours ) . Rest and drinking lots of water are the keys to treating mild forms of altitude sickness .

But of course , Allie thought nothing of it and did n't  think she would see him again . <p> One night , nearing the end of her time in Sweden , Allie and the exchange students went to a party with Swedish students and when they arrived , there was Jakob ! Allie was casually introduced to Jakob , but on this night they did n't  speak too much . It was n't until the next night out , Allie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night together talking ! ! <p> After that , Jakob knew there was something special about Allie and wanted to find out more about her and spend time with her . Jakob asked around his Swedish friends and other exchange students to see if someone had her number and if they knew which residence she lived in . Jakob sought her out , and one night got up the courage to go to her place and knock on the door ! <p> Over the next few days , classes were ending , exchange students were heading back to their home countries and Swedish students were heading back to their hometowns - including Jakob . On Allies last day in Sweden , Jakob was already back home in his home town of Arvika and working for the summer . However , he decided to jump on the first train back to Karlstad once he finished his shift at Lidl and invited Allie over for dinner . <p> Jakob prepared a typical Swedish meal for Allie and decided to make it a mature night by buying some wine ( according to Jakob @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wine : P ) . They spent the whole night talking and watching movies . Allie and Jakob parted ways for what they thought would be the last time they saw each other - Allie did n't  even give Jakob a kiss ! ! But emails were exchanged and they promised each other they would Skpe when Allie was back home in Canada ... <h> 2011-2013 - Long Distance Love <p> Once Allie returned to Canada , there was not a day that went by where they did n't  text or Skype . Skype gave them the opportunity to develop a friendship and bring them closer . That summer , Allie and Jakob got to know each other really well - every spare moment was spent in front of the computer and neither of them could wait to get home from a long day and just talk to each other . Over the next few months , Jakob barely slept , he would stay up until midnight ( Swedish time ) and wait until Allie was home from work and they ended up Skyping for hours on end . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sweden - he would stay up until 5 or 6 am his time and go to bed the same time as Allie in Canada . The time difference never got in their way - they ALWAYS managed to make it work ! ! Jakob even met Allie 's family and friends over Skype . <p> There was one defining weekend where Allie and Jakob spent 14 hours talking over Skype . Allie had never known a person who she could just talk to for hours on end , and they never fell short of anything to talk about . One of their first dates even took place over Skype , there was an old movie he had never seen before and classic in Allie 's eyes " Night at the Roxbury " . Allie downloaded and played the movie on her computer and shared the screen with Jakob over Skype so he could see and hear the movie as well - They even both made popcorn so they could feel like they were together even though they werent ! <p> As their friendship grew , Allie and Jakob both developed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . Allie suggested that he come to Canada to visit her in the new year . It was her last semester at Laurier and she thought it would be a great experience for him and she also wanted to see him again and figure everything out . So sure enough , without hesitation Jakob booked his trip to Canada for 3 weeks in March 2011 ! ! <p> The next few years consisted of Allie and Jakob flying back and forth between Sweden and Canada - making sure to never go longer than 12 weeks without seeing each other ! <p> Then finally in January of 2013 , Allie helped Jakob move into a student house in St. Catharines for his semester abroad exchange program . This was a huge deal for Allie and Jakob because it was the first time they were able to be together for 8 consecutive months ! <p> They were finally able to live as a real couple , and they could n't have been happier or more excited . They would always dream and talk about " one day " ; one day well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day well have our own place in the city ; one day we wont have to have Skype dates anymore . And finally , a taste of what their " one day " would be like , had arrived more or less . <h> 2015 - The Proposal <p> Fast forward to 2015 ... <p> After a long excruciating process with Immigration Canada , Jakob was finally able to leave the country and head back to the homelands for the first time in over 2 years ! ! Jakob and Allie planned this trip over Christmas so that they could have more time off and Jakob could celebrate the holidays with his family for the first time since 2012 . <p> This trip back to Sweden was also very special for Allie , it was her first time back since 2012 . Jakob and Allie traveled all around Sweden over the two week trip visiting friends and going back to the city they met , they city that had their hearts - Karlstad . <p> Of course Allie was secretly hoping that Jakob would propose while they were back in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the place they had their ( some-what ) first kiss . But nothing happened . Slightly disappointed , Allie came to terms with the fact that maybe it was n't their time yet . On the last day of their trip Allie and Jakob took the train to Oslo to spend the day in a new city before heading back to Canada the next day . Proposing in Oslo was Jakob 's plan the entire time ! ! Instead of doing the obvious ( proposing in the place they met ) he wanted to make it more special , but proposing in a place that was new for them both . <p> Throughout their relationship , Allie and Jakob have experienced a lot of firsts together , and are always looking for new things to experience together whether its food , a sporting event , a city to travel to , etc. - so being in this new city together for the first time seemed like the perfect opportunity to surprise her . <p> Jakob took Allie to a famous park in Oslo , Frogner Park , that consists of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fountains . Since it was December , the entire park was covered in snow and lit up by lights . Jakob and Allie took a stroll around this park , looking a sculptures and taking it all in . Meanwhile , Jakob was trying to scope out the perfect spot . Jakob found a small sculpture that was off to the side by one of the small bridges , he distracted Allie by telling her to take a photo of the sculpture for " memories " and when she turned around he grabbed her hands and nervously began to speak . Before Allie was able to process what was happening , Jakob got down on one knee ( in the cold snow ) , opened the ring box and asked her to marry him ! !

The party was being thrown by Alex Mack at his beach house located near the Strand in Hermosa . The party grew quickly to well over a hundred wild and crazy people . In typical Sammie form , she kept to those she knew best , namely her friends Juli , Casey and Tyler , and her cousins Clay and Chase . <p> Meanwhile , Jeff could not be more excited to be at the party . He had driven down for the weekend with his friends Nick Tess and Baron Vaught to attend his good friend 's party . The party was full of Jeff 's college buddies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known from growing up . Jeff was enjoying the rowdiness of the party and being reunited with all his longtime friends . <p> Throughout the party Jeff noticed this beautiful girl across the room hanging out with Juli , Casey and Tyler ( one of Jeff 's best friends and Casey 's boyfriend ) . She seemed out of place and in a way a little stand offish , hiding behind her blue tinted Ray Ban aviator sunglasses . This was one of the few unfamiliar faces at the party and Jeff was immediately intrigued by this girl . <p> As the loud party atmosphere gave way to a smaller crowd of close friends , Jeff mustered the courage to come up to Sammie , put his arm around her and struck up a conversation . <p> Sammie , originally thinking that Jeff was just some big " meathead " , realized there was more to this guy than she thought .

Sammie was the sweetest girl he had ever met , smart , decisive and she wanted to go get Mexican food !

@@76691022 @5391022/ <h> Sikh Wedding Ceremony <p> Sikh marriage was introduced by our fourth Guru Guru Ram Das in 1552 and was given statutory recognition by the British Rulers in 1909 under the Anand Marriage Act . The Guru explained the spiritual union allegorically by saying that : The husband and wife are always close to each other , separated only by their ego . " He made this analogy the basis of the Sikh marriage and declared that the fulfillment of a marriage consists of spiritual unity to weed out the ego with joint effort . Marriage is considered to be a very sacred institution by the Sikhs . It is a religious affair , a spiritual union performed in the presence of Guru Granth Sahib , the holy book of the Sikhs . It is a sacred sacrament , although the bodies remain separate , the souls in them merge and become one harmonious whole . <p> Sehra Bandi <p> Grooms sister ties sehra to his turban . Sehra is the tinsel veil that partially covers the grooms face . <p> Barat <p> Barat is the procession of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &amp; friends at the venue . When the Groom is ready Barat departs for the actual wedding venue accompanied by singing and drum playing . <p> Milni <p> Welcome of Barat is called Milni . Members of the two families placing garlands over their counterparts heads as a sign of welcome and joining of the two family . <p> Anand Karaj <p> Guests must cover heads with a scarf or handkerchief and they must remove their shoes before entering the prayer hall where the actual wedding ceremony ( Anand Karaj ) will be held . During any Sikh religious service , everyone sits on the floor . This symbolises the equality of all people in the eyes of God . People usually sit cross-legged , but it is imperative that feet must not be pointed in the direction of the holy book . <p> 1 . Kirtan - After the reception of the Barat ( the grooms relatives and friends ) the groom and his entourage go inside the congregation hall accompanied by the relatives and friends of the bride . Both parties sat together and listen to the Kirtan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Guru Granth Sahib . <p> 2 . Seating of the Bride and the Groom - The groom is seated first , facing the Guru Granth Sahib . Then the bride comes , escorted by her sister(s) and friends and takes her place by the groom on his left side . <p> 3 . Invoking Blessings - This ardas is only carried out by the bride , the bridegroom and their parents while the rest of the congregation remain seated . The granthi ( priests ) prays to Waheguru ( God ) invoking His blessings for the proposed marriage and begging His grace on the union of the couple . This denotes not only the consent of the bride and groom , but also of their parents in the presence of relatives and friends . <p> 4 . Hukamnama ( Order of the Day ) - Then the Guru Granth Sahib is opened and a verse is read at random . This is called the order of God . <p> 5 . Advice to the Bride and the Bridegroom - The head of the raggis then address the bride @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the new life in which they are about to enter . <p> 6 . Pallae di Rasam ( Tying the wedding knot ) - The brides father gives the hand of his daughter by placing the other end of the grooms long scarf into the brides hand while a short hymn sung . Holding this scarf in her hand , she later follows him during the main ceremony when they go around the Guru Granth Sahib . <p> 7 . Lavan ( The Marriage Hymn ) - Guru Ram Das , the fourth Guru of the Sikhs , also composed means to unite . A Sikh marriage is an attempt at uniting the individual soul to the Universal soul . The granthi starts the actual marriage ceremony , the prescribed four hymns are first read from the Guru Granth Sahib and then sung by the raggis . The modes of the acceptance of the promises contained in the hymns are that the bride and the groom listen to hymns when read from the Guru Granth Sahib and how to show their acceptance . The hymns are then sung by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up their minds . If they are sure of accepting the promises and taking the vows to fulfil them , then they stand up , go round the Guru Granth Sahib and bow again before sitting down . The significance of going round the Guru Granth Sahib is that they are calling God to be their witness during the wedding ceremony and the second signifies the final acceptance of the promises . <p> The First Lavan - The Promises to love forever : This hymn explains the duties towards God , to each other , to the family and to the community at large . In the first Lavan , the Waheguru asks the bride and the bridegroom to promise that : ( 1 ) Only Gurbani is the Guru and the scriptures for a Sikh , practise truth and remember the Waheguru , and ( 2 ) Love your partner forever from the bottom of your heart and the Waheguru will bless you with happiness . Love is a delicate thing : it may get injured by the slighted departure from the truth or sincerity . Great sensitive art @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make two strange lives grow into one . <p> The Second Lavan - The promise to merge completely into one another : The Waheguru has caused your union and now you both promise that : ( 1 ) You will dispel all the fears of your past life and will throw away all your pride ; ( 2 ) You will respect each other and will always live in others eyes and heart ; ( 3 ) You will descend in each others soul and will always remain each others beloved and ( 4 ) Your relation will be forever and you will always share your happiness and sorrow . <p> The Third Lavan - The promise to be faithful : Your mind , which until yesterday , had only distinct dreams , is today filled with utmost happiness . You are very fortunate that you both have been united in the presence of this congregation . Now you promise that you will always : ( 1 ) Live in humility ; ( 2 ) Speak to each other with sweetness and love , and you will not forget the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of no one else except each other , and will share each others dreams and be faithful forever and ( 4 ) From today both your actions and fortunes will be joint and one . <p> The Fourth Lavan - The promise to be together in both happiness and adversity : The fourth stage is that of harmony or union , of complete oneness , of perfect balance which knows no separation , no mistrust . This is the stage in which effort is eliminated . The brides past and present become the grooms past and present . They feel and think alike and both are completely identified with each other i.e. they become one spirit in two bodies . " The Waheguru has blessed you both . This marriage has been solemnised in the presence of God . Human love is superseded by divine love . " Now you both promise that you will always remain together in both happiness and adversity and will live in each others heart . When the Lavan ceremony is finished the couple are declared to be husband and wife . <p> 8 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blessed sweets ) - After the completion of Lavan , other shabads are sung followed by the Anand Sahib , the Song of Bliss which is composed by the third Guru , is read and finally the ardas is said in which the whole congregation joins .

Also , it 's pretty . 
@@76691034 @5391034/ <h> Our Story <h> How we met <p> James says : <p> We first met at a " speed thesis " event , where students were paired up in quick 5-minute " speed dating-style " conversations to discuss and brainstorm ideas about their respective theses . I was in the Finance department , while Sarah was in the Accounting department , and we only spent about 30 seconds out of the 5 minutes talking about our projects , and the rest about ourselves ! Haha <p> About a month later , we bumped into each other again at the annual Commerce Department Ball after-party , and we started dancing with each other . I remember thinking she looked really beautiful , and also thinking that she was quite interested in me as well , as she asked me out straight away to an EDM concert that was taking place in three months time while we were still dancing ! She claims she was just being friendly , but I still think she was quite interested ! Haha <p> Sarah says : <p> We met on 2nd August 2011 at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the University of Melbourne . I was in the Accounting Honours programme whilst he was in the Finance Honours programme . I remember my heart skipped a beat when he first walked in and I was like Ooh who is this ! ? <p> We happened to be in the same group and I remember that we spent no more than 30 or 45 seconds talking about our theses and the rest of the time just talking about random things . Haha And I remember thinking , Hey this guy is a great catch we can talk really easily , he s smart , good looking , and really friendly ! Then , that night , I stalked him on Facebook to find out morebut all I could really find out was that he had done a Commerce and Arts double degree , he studied German and politics and that he had gone to Canada on exchange . Of course , I did n't admit this to him till much , much later ... : P <p> I thought I would n't see him ever again as we were in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later at the Commerce Ball after party ! : ) We danced , laughed and talked all night and at the end of the night , when he dropped me home , he asked if he could bring me out on a coffee date . Of course I said yes ( : P ) and gave him my number . <h> The First Date <p> James says : <p> We went out on a first official date a couple of weeks after the Commerce Ball to Seven Seeds , the local university artisan coffee house . Which is funny , as neither of us drink coffee ! We hit it off quite well , although Sarah exclaimed as she arrived that " she was glad that I stood outside the coffee house , as she was n't sure if she would remember what I looked like " ! <p> Sarah says : <p> Following the 3-day rule , he only messaged me three days after the Commerce Ball . By this time , I had found out that my grandfather had passed away and I had to fly back to Singapore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take a rain check . Fast forward two weeks and I was back in Melbourne but he still had n't  messaged meso one of my good friends ended up hijacking my phone and messaging him for me . Luckily , he replied almost immediately and we met for green tea ( because neither of us drink coffee ! haha ) at Seven Seeds a popular Melbourne Uni cafe a few days later . <p> I remember feeling really nervous and purposely timing my arrival to be a few minutes late . I also remember wondering if I would recognise him seeing as how I actually did n't  initially recognise him at the Commerce Ball . Whoops ! : P Luckily , he was standing outside the cafe and when I saw him , my heart was like , ' Yep that 's him ! ' : P Then of course , big-mouth me had to go and tell him , Oh ! Good thing you are standing out here ! I was so scared I would n't recognise you ! Haha talk about bruising a guys ego:P OH well ! <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so easily and we laughed and talked about all sorts of different things . We also found out that we had similar views on a lot of things . I also quickly slipped in that I did n't  know how to cook and he seemed cool with it which is a bonus ! Haha ( Still ca n't cook by the way:P ) But one thing that really stood out was the fact that he kept on giving me the double thumbs up ? ! I remember thinking that it was really weird and super enthusiastic of him as I had n't  remembered him doing that before . Luckily , this did n't  occur during our future datesin fact I do n't  think Ive ever seen him give me a double thumbs up since ? ! HAHA Only much later on in our relationship , when I teased him about it , did he confess to me that he was really nervous that day . : P <p> And I guess the date must have gone really well for him too because he suggested that we meet at Seven Seeds again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Relationship <p> It 's full of love , open communication , fun , mutual respect and trust , and support and understanding . <h> What do you like most about each other ? <p> James says : <p> There are so many things I like about Sarah !

@@76691068 @5391068/ <h> Kristyn&amp;Kristian <h> Happily Ever After <h> Our Story <h> The Relationship <p> Unconventional . We met for the first time in December 2013 . We had an online group video chat with a mutual friend . In Norwegian we say " s ha et ye for hverandre " which roughly translates to " having an eye for each other , " and I would say that already after that one night of chatting we got exactly that . <p> Following that night we chatted more often , although it was n't until right after New Years that we really could n't stay away from each other . At the end of January I had already booked my tickets to come see her and we started planning our trip to California . <p> After meeting her in Denver and spending a couple of days with her , I truly realized just how special she is . We vacationed in California , starting our trip in Los Angeles and ending it in San Francisco . Simply put : we had the time of our lives together . <p> Most of our relationship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kristyn . Even if we live thousands of miles away and have eight hours between us , we 've perfected the art of long distance communication . Our relationship is the kind where I genuinely put her before myself and vis versa , which makes it wonderfully effortless . 65104 @qwx685104 <p> Perfect . Kristian proposed on Montara Beach near Half Moon Bay on May 12th during our holiday in California . After yet another fantastic day sleeping in , breakfast on our private balcony watching the ocean , driving along the coast , and exploring California , we ended our day at the beach just before sunset . It was nearly empty , so we cozied up by the shore and chatted while we watched the sun go down . <p> I 'd never seen the Pacific , let alone a sunset over the ocean , so I remember saying ' It 's so beautiful ' nearly a hundred times ( no joke ) . Kristian , on the other hand , is a coastal baby , who 's grown up with sunsets over the ocean . But that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have experienced something a hundred times , it does n't matter because it 's the first time for us . <p> A few minutes before the sun dipped under the water , Kristian asked that I take off my sunglasses so he could see my eyes ( to my confusion ) . He then gave me the loveliest , sincerest , smiley-est , most beautiful proposal a girl could wish for - I did n't even pause before I said ' yes . ' <p> Then I decided we should dip our feet in the water to celebrate ! <h> About the Bride <p> Kristyn is my American princess . She is a self-proclaimed New Hampshirite . She works as a sales and marketing coordinator for a company in Denver . She is a very hard working girl , and she 's also very stubborn which results in her doing a good job both for work and for the two of us . She is one of the most kindhearted people I have ever known . Shes always happy , always smiling . <p> These are just a few things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but I will have to cut it short here because you will hear more at the wedding . <h> About the Groom <p> Kristian is my Norwegian babe . He grew up in Stavanger , has a hillbilly accent ( his words , not mine ) , works at a local car mechanic shop , and , let 's be honest , spends an awful lot of time chatting up his fiancT . <p> Kristian always says yes when a friend asks for help . He laughs a lot , and smiles even more . He works hard and follows through with any plans . He is kind and generous but also shy and quiet . <p> Regardless of all his fantastic qualities , though , the absolute best thing about Kristian is that he is just as weird as me ( if not more ) and we can be exactly who we are with each other . <h> About Us <p> 4,554 . We may have an inordinate amount of miles between the two of us at the moment , and we may only get to share the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so-called ' challenges ' aside , it would be hard to imagine a more well-matched couple . <p> We have both been blessed with wonderful role models in our lives of that ' ideal ' relationship that we dream of having , and we assumed we would be scouring the far corners of the world to find that ' one . ' Fortunately for us , we found each other , and it happened while we are young , so we can look forward to a very long , and happy life together .

Fares are payable on the train and are CASH ONLY ( about $12 roundtrip to Philadelphia ) .

Adam was a senior playing on the basketball team and I was a freshman on the cheerleading team . It was n't until 7 years later when we ran into each other again at the gym when the sparks flew ! <h> Popping the question <p> I have to give Adam a lot of credit here because I was completely surprised and had no clue at all that he was planning on proposing . I found out after that he had planned this proposal out for months . I could n't have asked for a more perfect proposal . <p> A little preface to the proposal .... Michelle was working at a very stressful nursing job and she would tell me almost every day how much she needed a vacation . This was pretty consistent for a year or longer . She was always talking about how bad she wanted to go back to Cancun and just needed some time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and comes straight home , but the day before I had planned on proposing , I asked her if she had any plans the next day just to make sure everything would go as planned . Of course , she says she had planned on stopping by Ashley 's house on the way home . So I had to come up with something quick and I told her that my parents wanted to take us out to eat to one of our favorite restaurants Zin Burger . I knew she would n't pass that up ! <p> It was October 23rd , 2014 and Michelle got home from work . In the garage I put up a little note on the door with some simple instructions to follow prior to coming into the house . I think for the first time ever she actually listened to me ! She finally walked in the door and laid out in front of her were both of our suitcases with over 100 roses set up in the entry way and living room . On top of her suitcase there was a folded up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ letter was our travel itineraries with passports leaving to Cancun at our favorite resort the very next morning at 6:30 am .

I let her know that I had already taken care of that . I had talked with her manager months in advance to request the vacation time off and made sure they kept it a secret . <p> After she got over the shock that we were going to Cancun in 12 hours , I let her know that we were n't going to dinner with my parents and that I had made our favorite meal and there was one more surprise for her . I told her how much I loved her and wanted to spend the rest of my life with her ..... dropped to a knee and proposed ! .

After a few days of talking on the phone we decided to meet up one night when she was n't working somewhere around 9 or 10pm . There were n't a whole lot of options that late so we went to the Village Inn to get some coffee . We ended up talking for hours , in fact we were there until they closed . We were having such a great time that we did n't want the night to end so we ended up going to the only place we could think of that was n't a bar that would be open ... IHOP .

Michelle is still working as an RN and Adam is working as a software sales consultant as well as owning a small pharmaceutical sales business . <p> During our 7 years we started our own little family and have been blessed with the sweetest dog ever Sassy .

If we did n't cover a question you have please reach out to us . <p> - What is the dress code for the Wedding ? <p> Several guests have asked us .... " what should we wear to your wedding and the other events " , well , we are here to help ! To preface , Rockhouse Hotel is located on the cliffs , not on the beach therefore you will be on stone as opposed to sand ( this means no sandy feet in bed ! ) . <p> SHOES : For my ladies ... you are welcome to wear flats or heels ; personally , I would pack both because you may want to change it through the weekend . You should be able to comfortably walk in heels around Rockhouse hotel as the walkways are well maintained . <p> CLOTHING : Please refer to our schedule page where we will list the suggested attire under each of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to wear please email or call us . We do n't want you to be stressed ! Jamaica is all about pure relaxation and just having a good time . <p> - Do I need to rent a car to get around ? What if I am not staying at Rockhouse Hotel , do I need a car ? <p> In short , it is not necessary to rent a car . Some people may prefer to rent a car , which is completely fine if that is your preference . If you do rent a car , I would recommend inquiring about parking with your hotel . <p> SHUTTLE SERVICE : We will be offering group shuttle service to and from the airport on Thursday 11.30 and Sunday 12.03 . If your flights are on different days please be sure to note that on the shuttle information page and we will do our best to accommodate your flight . In order to book a shuttle we require your flight information so please be sure you fill this out on the Shuttle Information page . <p> All of the hotels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cliffs , if you are staying at a beach property you will need to take a taxi to Rockhouse and other cliff hotels . We will offer shuttle service for the weekend of our wedding to and from Rockhouse and cliff properties ( not beach properties ) . <p> TAXI CABS : Cabs are readily available at each hotel through the front desk - just stop by and let them know if you need one . If you want to have dinner off property , most restaurants will come pick you up at your resort and take you to the restaurant ( they want the business ! ) . Just double check with the restaurant about the return trip , some charge for that . <p> EXCURSIONS : If you are hoping to explore beyond the resort you can easily book an excursion or a tour ; almost all tours include round trip transfers from your hotel . <p> *IMPORTANT* As with many small islands , Jamaica has a problem with credit card theft and fraud so we have a few proactive suggestions below : <p> 1 . Do not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at any small shop or local island places ( you are fine using a credit card at all of the hotels we have suggested ) . <p> 3 . For any credit card you do bring we advise you to call your credit card company ahead of time and let them know you are traveling to Jamaica . Also , let them know the dates of your stay . When calling be sure to double check that you will not be charged any foreign or international transaction fees . <p> That being said , all of the hotels we listed and most places do take credit cards ( Visa , Mastercard suggested ) , including all excursion companies . Roadside/local places + drivers are cash only . <p> There is no need to exchange money at the airport . Just bring some smaller bills to tip airport porters or buy drinks . We suggest bringing no higher than $20 bills ; bring a nice supply of $1 's , $5 's , $10 's and $20 's . Everywhere will take US dollars , but the smaller bills are better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rate is around $120j : $1 US dollar . Soa beer may be $300-$400j , a + Jerk chicken is about $600j.so $100j is about $1 ( its really like $.80 ) , but , easier to keep track this way . Bring enough cash to get you through your trip because you may not find your bank on the island . Most rooms have a safe ..... just double check with your hotel . <p> You are in Jamaica .... do you really need to use your phone mon ! ? ! Though we want you to use your phone as little as possible , we know you may want to communicate with each other so here is what we know .... some carriers allow you to text and use data while traveling internationally ; check with your phone carrier before you travel . There is a phone app that allows you to text and make calls using wifi for free , called WhatsApp . Highly recommended to use so you may call each other , the bus driver , etc. using the wifi at your hotel . Also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with wifi at your hotel .

I do n't  remember him much , I viewed him as one of those " too cool for school " guys . Little did I know he was n't around much because he did n't  live on campus and worked a lot . Jared and I only ever had one beer together in college . Fall 2005 . One day him and another classmate showed up to class each drinking out of a coffee mug and with big smiles on their faces . It was 2 oclock in the afternoon , so I knew darn well that was n't coffee in their mugs . I gave them a hard time after class ( mainly because I was jealous of their concoctions ) and all three of us ventured to IC Muggs , a local college hangout in good ol C-town . We had a couple of beers , ate some popcorn and each went on our merry way enjoying life . <p> Now let 's fast forward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friends on Facebook . One hot August day as I was trying to make little Sunflower babies out in the field Jared sent me a message with something about having a beer . I smiled a little bit when I got that message , but continued on my day like any other . Over the course of a couple of weeks Jared convinced me to go have a beer with him at JL Beers . Truth be told I was only in it originally for the deer hunting and the invite went something like this , " why do n't  we get together for a beer and talk about bow hunting ? We were one of the last people to leave JL Beers that night . We did n't  kiss , but he gave me a big hug ( then I realized how short I was ) and I left with a smile knowing that there was something special about this guy .

It is good for sunning and swimming , but you can also rent a sailboat or kayak or take a catamaran cruise . Some travelers choose to take surfing lessons at Kalapaki , while others take a break from the sun 's rays by hanging out in one of the beachfront cafes or shops . <h> Spouting Horn <p> A fun stop on Kauais south shore is Spouting Horn .

I imagined that my kids would love anticipating it as the waves come in and waiting for the biggest spray . <h> Waimea Canyon and Koke'e @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Canyon of the Pacific " is a must . This 10-mile-long , mile-wide , and approximately 3,500-feet deep gorge can accommodate both low-impact workouts ( taking a winding drive through the canyon and making a few lookout stops along the way ) or high-octane adventures ( you can also hike down one of the verdant trails ) . You 'll find the Waimea Canyon along Highway 550 in the town of the same name . The gorge spreads across Waimea Canyon and Koke'e State parks . <h> Kilauea Lighthouse <p> The 52-foot-tall Kilauea Lighthouse has n't been an active structure since 1976 , but it remains a popular tourist attraction for numerous reasons .

This area is only accessible by kayak . <h> HANAPEPE SWINGING BRIDGE <p> This bridge may not be the biggest adventure on Kauai , but it 's enough to make your heart hop . It 's considered a historic suspension bridge even though it was rebuilt in 1996 after the original was destroyedlike so much of the islandby Hurricane Iniki . What is interesting about this bridge is that it 's not just for show ; it actually provides the only access to taro fields across the Waimea River .

Thank you so much for joining us on our special day . <p> Please RSVP in the menu above . We also have photos , our bridal party , registry , and other general information there for you as well . <h> Our Story <h> By Elty McMillan <p> How We Met <p> The first thing that I want to say is this is how I remember our story . Amber might have a totally different recollection of these events , but this is our story as I remember it . Our story starts out as most typically do ; there was a weird , loud , talkative boy and an incredibly smart , quiet , beautiful girl who was way out the boys league . Fortunately , for me this story begins in a speech class at Lane Community College , so being loud and talkative was , for the first time in my life , a benefit . Being the outgoing charismatic person that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confident young men do when they want to talk to a beautiful girl . I messaged her on Facebook and asked her what the homework was . She was kind enough to respond , but the conversation ended with her just giving me the homework , which I actually did need that time . Not wanting to seem desperate , I decided to play it cool and wait a few days to talk to her again . That strategy lasted roughly 17 hours when I decided that I could n't wait any longer to talk to her again . Instead of trying to come up with something creative , or funny , or cute to get her number I decided to ask the exact same question . " Hey so what was the homework he gave today ? Sorry I know I already asked you this yesterday " . If you are reading this and thinking to yourself " there is no way that this is how it all started " , trust me I am just as surprised that my strategy worked as you ! After being told to " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that began the greatest journey that I have ever been on in my entire life . <p> How Our Friendship Started <p> The first time that I hung out with Amber outside of the classroom was during a freezing cold day in the middle of November . I only remember this because I had parked all the way across campus that day and I had just got to my car when I got a text from " The Cool Twin " ( this is a whole different story that I can explain to you at the wedding if you really want to know ) asking me to come hang out with her because her class was canceled . I remember being freezing cold until I saw that text and was instantly warm , but I think that was mostly because I was so nervous . I honestly do n't  think I have ever been so excited or nervous in my entire life . I also do n't  know why I was so nervous ; maybe my heart knew that I would spend the rest of my life with this amazing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but I do remember that it went by way too fast and there was a lot of laughing . I am a worrier by nature . I stress out about almost everything , but in that moment of hanging out with Amber I felt so relaxed and happy . I wanted to be around her as much as I could because she made me feel peaceful . <p> Meeting her family <p> This part of the story is n't incredibly relevant to our story , but its one of my favorite moments . When I first met Ambers family it was at their house . Amber had invited me over for dinner and because I really liked her I decided to overcome my fear of meeting parents and decided to go . When I arrived at her house I gave myself the pep talk . The one anyone who has ever seen " What About Bob " gives themselves when doing anything important , " I feel good , I feel great , I feel wonderful " . My plan was solid , I would go up to her house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friendly voice and play it cool the entire night . That plan did n't  work at all . After I knocked and the door started to open I started to say " hey " , and for those of you that do n't  know me my voice is naturally high pitched , which would n't have been a big deal if Amber had opened the door . Amber , however , did not open the door . It was her dad Tony , so in the middle of saying " hey " in my usual high pitched voice I immediately switched to a more manly and assertive hello and dropped my voice about 7 octaves . It was so embarrassing . Now I do n't  know if Tony thought I was weird or not for doing that , but he did walk around the house the rest of the time that I was there with a pistol tucked in his waistband . At that moment I realized that Amber had a very strong family that cared deeply for her and I am very thankful to her parents for that . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Years <p> I could literally write a book about all the amazing experiences that I have had with my beautiful fiance but for now I will try to sum this up nicely . By the time that our wedding day comes I will have known Amber for four years . These have been the most exciting four years of my life . We have been through so much together and I could not ask for a more perfect companion to guide me through life . We have been through at least five full Netflix series , most of which were her ideas but I grew to love/appreciate them ; four camping trips ; two trips to Spokane ; and an insane amount of studying for nursing , all of which has brought us closer together and has provided us with memories that will last a lifetime . We love to be with each other ; in all honesty that is our favorite part of each day . We love to walk , hike , workout , and eat healthy . But we also eat ice cream and watch Netflix . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by making every day a new adventure and a new experience .

Expect sunshine and warmth during the day . In the evening , expect to see the gentlemen offering their coats to ladies . <p> Traveling : We expect that most guests will be traveling to the Ojai Valley Inn and that travel will feature airplanes and cars . We encourage you to resist the temptation to dress " comfortably " on the airplane journey and certainly in the car journey . No one wants to make their first impression on the weekend in sweatpants . You 'll feel better if you travel in clothes that would allow you do go straight to the welcome cocktail party on arrival . <p> Around the Ojai Valley Inn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the webpage for the Inn . Notice the stucco walls and whitewashed palate . Notice the grass , the clay stone walkways . Consider lightweight fabrics and comfortable shoes ( but no sandals ) . Socks are discouraged almost all of the time . Fleece is illegal in California . <p> Pool : There will be a pool so you should bring a bathing costume , including appropriate footwear . Also sunglasses . <p> Fitness : There will be a gym and fitness centre . If you are so inclined , you should bring athletic attire , including proper shoes . <p> Sleeping : You will be sleeping a few nights at the Ojai Valley Inn . Dress appropriately : something lightweight , one or two pieces , a robe , and slippers . Light colours are best for sleeping . Nude is best for not sleeping . <p> Rehearsal Dinner : The dinner is outdoors at the Ojai Valley Inn Herb Garden . Here we will be enjoying garden-table meals served by chef stations . We will be breaking the ice , learning names and sharing stories . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and equivalent for ladies ( such as a cocktail or party dress ) . Imagine that you are going out on the town . You might meet someone you absolutely adore . Make it memorable . Be a little bit daring . <p> Wedding Day : The wedding day we will be on various terrains : gravel walkways through the Meditation Mount , lawns for cocktail reception . There will also be a long period of staying still and just watching . <p> The appropriate dress is " rustic black tie " . This means that if you have black tie , or are able to acquire black tie before the wedding , you should do that . If you do n't  have black tie , you should wear something equally elegant . To this you should add some panache : a summer scarf , corsage , spectator , or opera glasses are suggestions . <p> For men , " black tie " means a tuxedo or dinner jacket , matching trousers , white shirt , black bow tie , cummerbund or vest , and polished black shoes . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grey or black are fine and pair well with a subdued tie . Variations on these themes are perfectly acceptablethe aforementioned " panache " but try to remember that Hess is the star of this show . <p> For ladies , " black tie " means a formal dress in any colour other than white ( that 's just for Ana ! ) . The regal shades are always appropriate : purple , burgundy , deep navy . Autumnal shades are also welcome . All dress lengths are stamped for approval but be warned that long dresses might not be the most comfortable given the venue . Be creative . Use your imagination . The iPhone paparazzi will be everywhere . <p> MOST IMPORTANTLY , there will be excessive dancing and walking over uneven surfaces , which means that anyone wearing heels should consider bringing a small pair of flat-soled shoes to alternate as appropriate . It will be chilly at night so bring a wrap for your shoulders or a gentleman with a coat you do n't  mind borrowing .

I was looking like the man of the year ; a true boss . I had just checked into the barracks and I see this midget behind the reception desk , so I thought i would do a little charity work because short people need love too . I asked her name and I get a WHY YOU WANT TOO KNOW ! So me being the gentleman that I am I kindly said I thought you were beautiful and I would like too know your name . I asked if I could take her out to dinner , you know I 'm thinking Netflix and chill and I got maybe . In my head I was like dang midgets are getting feisty but I said okay . Later that night I cut my hair and needed a broom to sweep up the mess . I strolled down to the front desk and the same angry midget was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then told me that I was the sexiest man on earth and she would love to treat me to dinner . This day officially became known as the worst day of my life ! ! ! <p> Her Version <p> There 's always 2 sides to a story and his version is n't going to be counted as one . I had a working weekend Friday , Saturday and Sunday working the 2:30pm -10:30pm shift . That Friday Carl came up to the desk and asked my name , I did respond with " WHY DO YOU WANT TO KNOW " . He said he would like to take me out and I responded with no . Saturday Carl came down and asked if I considered his request to take me out , my answer was still no . Now Carl did intrigue me , but I 'm stubborn and continued to stand my ground . My cousin Nikita ( bridesmaid ) kept telling me that I should talk to him , I never know how far this would go and to stop thinking negatively . Sunday Carl came down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out again , instead he asked for a broom . It was then I asked him his name and I did some inquiring about him soon as he walked away . I received nothing but positive feedback about Mr. Carl . Once he came back to return the broom I told him I considered his request to take me out . I had agreed and that has been one of the best decisions I 've ever made .
