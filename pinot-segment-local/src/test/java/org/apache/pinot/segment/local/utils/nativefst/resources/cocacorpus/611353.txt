The other adult rows across and the kid comes back . Both kids row across again . <p> The answer is actually feathers . We need proof though . AND SO : From Joni - One pound of feathers is more than one pound of gold because the " pound " unit is different . The most commonly used system of weights in the US and Great Britain is the avoirdupois system , where 1 pound = 16 ounces . This is used for most solid objects , except for precious metals and gems ; gold is weighed by a special system , called the troy system , where one troy pound = 12 troy ounces . Where one avoirdupois ounce is 28.35 grams , one troy ounce is about 31.10 grams . To convert from avoirdupois pounds to troy pounds , multiply the first by 1.2152 to get its equivalent in troy measurement . Therefore , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pounds ( one avoirdupois pound ) , compared to one troy pound of gold . And the feathers win . Thanks Joni. 
@@28870703 @2570703/ <p> Years ago , a little riddle was developed which has caused many people to ponder endlessly for its solution . The origin of this riddle is unknown to us ( at " Just Riddles and More ... ! ) but it is probably the most frequently submitted riddle with no solution and because of this , we offer here what we think is the best solution . If you have a better one or different one , see below . To understand the " GRY " riddle , it is essential that you accept that riddles are simply brain teasers using word tricks . To be a riddle , there must be a trick in the wording or usage of words in the riddle . A riddle is not generally answered by a fact or information found in a reference book . Also , a riddle often uses a trick from magic - that is , misdirection - some of the words are there to mislead you to thinking about something else . Now , the problem with the " GRY " riddle being circulated currently is this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here below - read it and see if it is the version you have been pondering ) to something that absolutely can not be answered . There is no answer to this version of the " GRY " Riddle - and rightly so , seeing as how it is not the correct version ! This is the most commonly ( though incorrect ! ) version of the " GRY " Riddle : <p> " There are three words in the English language that end in -GRY . Two are HUNGRY and ANGRY . The third one everyone uses every day and knows what it stands for . If you listened carefully , I already told you what the word is . What is the third word ? " <p> So , what is the riddle here ? What is the puzzle ? If the above is NOT the correct version , what is ? ? The following is what we believe to be the correct version of the " GRY " riddle : <p> " Think of words ending in -GRY . Angry and hungry are two of them you what it is . " <p> OK , now let 's take this riddle apart and solve it as a riddle . Remember , that a riddle has a trick with the words or usage of the words . The trick in this puzzle is misdirection . There are words here that are meant to mislead you and they do just that . The first two sentences in the puzzle have nothing to do with the question being asked : " Think of words ending in -GRY . Angry and hungry are two of them . " Ignore these two sentences . They are there to mislead and distract you . Works does n't it ? ? ? Now , what is left is the " meat " of the riddle : @ @ @ @ . " In the phrase , the English language , the third word is simply the word ' language ' . There you have it ! ! Get it ? ' Language ' is definitely something everyone uses every day and in the phrase " the English language " is the third word ! OK , now you 're saying , " That ca n't be it ; too easy ! ! " But remember what a riddle is and that the " GRY " riddle is a riddle - NOT a trivia question . " Ok " , you 're saying , " But that is really stupid ! " Hey , we did n't write this riddle - but we do believe that we have the solution , stupid or not ! We do n't have actual statistics , but we can say that the " GRY " riddle has really gotten around over the last twenty years or so and we get MANY requests for the solution . As is the case with riddles , you need to listen or read them carefully before solving and before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ riddle got really distorted - hopefully this explanation will help and satisfy all of you who have been racking your brains for the answer ! <p> By the way , there really are words in the English language that end in -GRY . However , they are definitely obscure and to most of us unknown and rarely used . When have you used bowgry , hogry , hangry or aggry in everyday circumstances ? ( Remember the riddle clearly states that the answer is something used every day by everyone . ) So forget about using any of those obscure words ! Instead , start repeating the riddle in its correct version and be happy that you now know the solution ! <p> **36;0;TOOLONG SOLUTIONS FOR THE " GRY " **38;38;TOOLONG <p> David Yates writes : I 'm not sure how much research you did to solve the gry riddle but I believe your answer is incorrect . First all the words you provided as ending in gry ( hangry , bowgry , hogry , aggry ) I could only find " aggry " . Quoted from your site : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hungry are two of them you what it is . " The answer to the riddle is " GRY " definition : Anything very small , or of little value . ( we use this everyday ) not the word but the meaning of the word . <p> " The WORD IS SOMETHING that everyone uses every day " This statement does n't say " everyone uses the word everyday " . You said in your own definition of riddle that the statements are misleading , and possibly when this riddle was developed the word " GRY " was used more frequently then it is now , or maybe this riddle was made for English majors , or scrabble champions . You were correct in saying " .... ending in -GRY . Angry and hungry ..... " " Ignore these two sentences . They are there to mislead and distract you " they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ word . Well anyways there are my two bits . Maybe you can post more then one solution since " the true answer is unknown " , and let people decide the correct solution to use . <p> From The Riddler : I am the originator of the " GRY " riddle True , Language is the third word in the phrase " the English language " , but that is not the answer to the original riddle . You have some typos on your solution page but here is the solution to the GRY riddle . <p> The trick to this riddle is it was designed to be read aloud . The trick is the usage of GRY vs . G or Y ( pronounced G R Y ) Now you should be able to figure out the answer <p> " Think of words ending in -GRY . Angry and hungry are two of them . There are three words people say in the English language that end in G " or " Y. What is the third word ? The word is something that everyone will say every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I have already told you the answer three times . " <p> From Lloyd&amp;Rachel : Could n't the answer be .. GEE or WHY ? <p> Mick Royston writes : Look at the way " The Riddler " stated the riddle .. Think of words ending in -GRY . Angry and hungry are two of them . The riddler explained that it was G or Y , in other words either one ... Now the 3rd word could end with a G or a Y .. He told us the answer three times and if you look , the word SAY is in the paragraph three times AND it ends with Y ... Read it aloud and the answer is ( now ) obvious ... I had not figured this out until the Riddler gave the hint about G or Y. <p> From Anthony Wagenseil : This is the version of the riddle he received : This is going to make you so MAD ! There are three words in the English language that end in " gry " . ONE is angry and the other is hungry . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stands for . EveryONE uses them everyday , and if you listened very carefully , I 've given you the third word . What is it ? gry . Now , I spent a good time on this , fiddling around with every possible trick , every possible misdirection , every possible word play , and in the end , the answer I came up with just seems obvious . This is a version of the riddle you do n't have on the website , so maybe the answer 's going to be incorrect , but I think there just is no right or wrong answer ; it 's all in how the riddle is said and interpreted . Look at it this way ... Let 's take it sentence by sentence first . The first sentence can either be overlooked or the capitalized " MAD " can be taken as a hint . In the end , however , the " MAD " is not a hint , so let 's just ignore the first sentence entirely . The second sentence clearly states that it is the sound or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ word we are looking for , not some " G or Y " possibility . The third sentence tells us that two of the three words are " angry " and " hungry , " so we are led to believe that the third word will be " something-gry . " So we dig in our brains to find this word . USELESS ! Look at the entire riddle , and notice that every instance of the word " one " is capitalized . Unlike the " mad " being capitalized for emphasis , the " one " phonetically and emphatically makes no sense , so it must be assumed that the capitalization is a clue ! So I thought , maybe the word is " onegry , " or " fouronegry " or something , but none of those work . ( I also thought that maybe the SOUND of " gry " in the third word was not like the " gry " in " angry " or " hungry , " but more like a " gree , " so that " onegry " would sound like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anywhere and was incorrect anyways , so let 's get back to the real solution . ) The " ONE " is definitely a clue . The " everyONE uses them every day " clearly opposes the interpretation that " language " is the correct answer , as the quote refers to the three words , the third one being the answer we are looking for . Now , there is a word " gry " which means ***a measure equal to one tenth of a line , or anything very small , or of little value*** . I do believe " ONE " is a good clue to this definition ! " 1 " is very small or of little value ! Then , the riddle direction of putting something in the blank spot ... but ca n't the blank spot be blank intentionally ! ? I think so ! So , my answer ( also deduced by my friend Scott Minkin ) is that the third word is simply " gry " ! The only part of the riddle that does not make much sense is the part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what it means . I 'm sure it 's not a common word today , but maybe when the riddle was originated it was . So , voila another possible solution ! <p> Sarah from Canada writes : Find a huge dictionary . The word " gry " means ' small and miniscule ' . It definitely ends in -gry . It is said in the question . <p> pentony offers this answer : POWER-HUNGRY ! ENDS IN GRY ! ! ! ! ! ! ! <p> Mishayla offers this information : gry is a middle english word that has been out of use for around 300 years . It was roughly equivalent to 0.0008 of an inch , thus its ' something very small ' definitions elsewhere on your page . <p> Beth writes:The answer is Language ..... if you read it carefully .. it does not ask you to find another word ending in " gry " .... it says there are 3 words in " the english language " .... what is the 3rd eword ... it is LANGUAGE .... duh .. lol <p> Tony Palin solves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was that this riddle was designed to be read aloud . If you are n't looking for correct spelling ( gry ) , but rather the sound , the answer is simple : Agree . <p> Here is a new way to look at this riddle ! Lakshmiraj suggests : I think the answer to the GRY riddle is " what " because if you take a look at the fourth sentence ... What is the third word ? ... it makes sense . I think the question mark is supposed to be misleading and it is actually supposed to be a period . With this in mind , I think this is the answer . <p> From Tony : I think a better solution is the word " WORD " which is the " THIRD WORD " in the paragraph . Or in other words this " What is the third word " can mean the third word in the paragraph . <p> William Powell writes : This answer makes a lot more sense to me than your answer .... but take a look , tell me what you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this one before .... but it goes , there are 2 sentences that you focus on , and forget the other two . first : There are three words in the English language that end in -GRY second : What is the third word ? forget the rest ... and what is the third word in the first sentence ( or in terms of the whole riddle ) ? its three going by what you said , that it was created without a given solution , I do n't know for sure if this is right , but it definitely seems to make the most sense to me <p> hi i 'm Gabi from Israel . my answer combines a few of the leads i read on this page . 1st the Riddler 's suggestion that GRY actually means g " or " y .. then the assumption that a few sentences are misleading .. finally the last sentence says " i already told you what it is " . all these combined makes the answer so very simple ! look at the 5th sentence : " THE WORD IS SOMETHING @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ends with a " g " , and the writer TOLD us what it is ... <p> From ChrsChrisa : Even though the Word AGREE does n't end in GRY maybe the GRY is there to throw you off because if this riddle is said aloud then you hear GRY not G-R-Y . <p> From Alien5880 - I am not sure but it might be Y. It can be a word .... why . And look at the sentence everyone uses every day . y is used 3 timEs in three words . and everyone knows what why means . It is only a guess . <p> From Lori : I think there is no answer . In the original riddle it says " There are only three words in the English Language . " In that quote alone I used 9 words , therefore it is a fake . There is no real answer . <p> Chris offers this : It took me a few time to read . I read the version that The Riddler sent . I guess he made a few corrections . If you read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read it aloud , the answer is clear . The riddle SAYs three time . The word " SAY " was stated three times and ends in the letter " Y " , as in YRG or Y or G. SOooo ... I 'm guessing and assume , and am very sure , the answer is " say " . <p> Here is a great solution for this riddle ; read carefully , it makes sense- From Mike : The answer is " and " . The three words are " hungry and angry " . The phrase as a whole ends with gry . The riddle never stated that each word had to end in gry , just that the three words do . The fact that hungry ends in gry is just misleading . The third word - and - is a word that everyone knows and uses every day ! <p> From Dave : It never said to find another gry word it just said there are three words in 1 the 2 English 3 language . I hope this helps . So in conclusion I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is just a silly sentence . <p> From Sean : okay if the riddler is the originator of this riddle , and s/he truly intended the gry to be read out loud g or y , then the only answer is say . however the whole riddle does n't make any sense because gry read out loud translates to g are y not g or y. with that in mind say the riddle out loud to yourself . " think of words ending in g are y ... there are three words people say in the English language that end in g are y. " it no longer makes any sense anymore . <p> From MRSSC13- I read everyone 's " answers " and the one I 'm leaning more to is that the answer is " say " , it is the only word that the riddler put in " three times " , and he/she does say " if you have listen carefully I have already told you the answer three times " , so I think the answer is " say " , because unless you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a coma , or purposely force yourself not to talk , you WILL ... " say " something every day " ..... ( but hey , even some of us say things in our sleep ! ) What do you think ? <p> From Murrae : I tend to agree with Lakshmiraj , with regards to the solution being " WHAT " . It would be the solution to both versions you supplied . The question " What is the third word ? " is n't a question rather a statement , giving us the answer - what . Also , I believe that the text " I have already told you what it is " should be " I have already told you what is it . " Just a thought. *Note : good idea ! ! <p> From Jaysprock : did it occur to anyone besides me that gry is actually a word ? it is a measure equal to one-tenth of a line or anything very small , or of little value ( dictionary.com ) . <p> From Daaron : The answer is dictionary . About @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ English dictionary there are 3 words that end in G.R.Y ... " Through the years the riddle was changed to English language and dropped the #1 clue , " OLD " . Back in the 1700 's ( I think it was then maybe older ) the OLD ENGLISH DICTIONARY was spelled DICTIONAGRY . Believe it or not , they actually miss-spelled the book . Or at least that 's how it was spelled . The G was silent . It was then corrected or changed when the English language started to change . We now say you instead of ye or thee ect .... I was stumped on this riddle for years until I found this out . If you do n't get the riddle said right , you 'll never get the answer . <p> From Paul : Having Heard what the originator of the riddle had to say the answer is clearly three . He said he told us three times and different versions of the word three appear in the riddle . <p> From Gimmy Jon : I 'm not much on riddles any more . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you three times ' clue or statement in one of the riddle versions ) the following is the solution : <p> Do n't read " What is the third word ? " as a question , but as the answer : " ' What ' is the third word . " The " third word " is " what . " Therefore , " what " is the answer . Like the old Abbott and Costello routine : Who 's on first , What 's on second , I-Don't-Know is on third . I ca n't imagine going through a whole day without asking at least once : " What time is it ? " or " What do you want ? " or " What happened ? " or just " What ? " for clarification . Therefore , " what " is used by everyone , daily --probably . <p> From Bryan : Actually I always figured that the answer to the riddle is " what " . Since they tell you that Angry and Hungry are the first two ... then goes on to say " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already told you the answer " Take that to read I already told you the third word that they are looking for is What . Agree or not that is the answer that I came up with when a friend tried to stump me . It is still a good riddle . <p> From Susan : Well , I think the originator of the riddle should just come out and tell us , before we all go nuts ! My guess is the answer is " gry " . First of all , he/she says that THERE ARE THREE WORDS ... he does n't say that they are the only words ... just that there are 3 ... there could be 3 or there could be more ... but there are 3 . Then " GRY " is used in the riddle ... and as it 's been pointed out ... gry is a word ... not a commonly used word , but it 's still a word . And he told us what it was , because he used it in the riddle . The originator told us that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ implied that if we read the word GRY out loud ... pronouncing each letter ... then we would come up with G or Y. ( Maybe he has a bad accent ? Maybe he pronounces his r 's as " or " instead of " are " ? -who knows ... ) Well , then he says that the word is something that everyone uses every day , and that we know what it means ... Well , I think that in everyday conversation ( unless you just do n't say anything ) we all say at least one of those words ... " Gee " , " or " , " why " ... and if we all have a bad accent , like the originator ... we would spell " GRY " if we said those 3 word together ... and again , he told us what it was ... because in the riddle , he used the word " GRY " ( GRY is what 's misleading ... ) So , GRY is the answer ... either that , or we are all right ... depending on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one answer ... I think the originator of the riddle has WAY too much time on his hands ! ! ! : - ) P.S. The originator indicated that the clue was in " GRY " and if you count ... he did say GRY 3 times ... I still think that what I said before is true ... but here are my other reasons why I think it is GRY ... The message that I originally received ended with : Send this to 5 People and the answer will pop up on the screen automatically . Well , being gullible ... I did send it to 5 people ... but nothing popped up on my screen . Get it ? NOTHING And according to David Yates ... the word GRY means " Anything very small , or of little value " Well NOTHING is very small ... and it 's also of little value ... When the originator wrote in ... he told us that he told us the answer ... but he did n't tell us anything ... he just told us another riddle ... he told us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everyone used every day ... well ... who can go through a day , without using something small or something or little value ? ? ? -thus the meaning of the word , GRY . Gry was used in the sentence in the riddle ... so the riddler did tell us the word ... because he used the word ... but not in the way that we thought ... The answer is GRY , without a doubt ! ! ! Any one else ? Think I 'm right ? The message said I would get the answer when I passed it on to 5 people ... but I got GRY ... I got NOTHING ! ! ! <p> From Ravin : I believe I have come up with a solution to the -GRY riddle , possibly THE solution . Part of the riddle suggests the answer bright as day , it reads " Think of words ending in -GRY . Angry and hungry are two of them . THERE ARE ONLY THREE WORDS in the English Language . " Angry , and , hungry . Those are only three words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " angry &amp; hungry " ( angry and hungry as the two words " and " being the conjunction ) but after awhile you begin to see " angry , and , hungry " ( each as a seperate word ) . There for angry + hungry are two words , leaving " and " to be the third . This is my interpretation of the puzzle , I 'm sure others will see it as I do . Hopefully this solution will at least offer grounds for others to revise and come up with a better one . <p> Soulfly writes : I think I have figured something out think about this we use ( SLANG ) everyday it said There are only three words in the English launguage there is the word English , the word language in between both words is the 3rd word Engli s h lang uage ( slang ) <p> From C. W. - This may help with the solution to the gry riddle . As the Riddler stated it is meant to be read aloud and that is the key . Another example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one dies how many do you have ? " When read it is easy , twenty nine but it you say it aloud it sounds as though you are saying thirty six sheep not thirty sick sheep just like " gry " or " g or y " . Just trying to help . <p> Jason writes : I am just going by the riddle that the site claims that is the correct version , ignoring any other variations because they would make things more confusing . What the people on the board seem to be doing is looking too hard for the answer to the riddle . If you have to look at something besides the riddle itself then it is not the answer . So , you can stop thinking about the actual word " gry " being the answer or the old English version of dictionary , " Dictionagry . " The only way that these would even be a possibility is if the question was very old , and if it truly is that old then the riddle would have most likely lost any possible answer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what " being the answer . I find this to be unlikely , because riddles will use correct english in a riddle . So , to say that , " What is the third word ? " is actually a command is in reality cheating , because now you are warping the riddle by adjusting punctuation . " What is the third word ? " is a question due to it 's use of " what " an you what it is . " First , the riddle tells you to listen carefully so the answer must be inside these lines . Second , it says that there are three words in the English Language , so then it must one of those three . Finally , it gives you a logical hint of which one it is by saying , " The word is something that everyone uses everyday . " All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Conclusion , the answer to the riddle ( if there is one ) is most likely to be " Language " as this answer stays within the rules of riddle logic and it is actually found in the riddle . So , I whole-heartedly agree with the website and their answer . <p> From Thirsting- Your version of this riddle seems logical to have been the original . First of all , as you state , it is a ' riddle ' not a trivia question . Therefore , your answer , ' language ' makes the most sense as to being the right answer . When doing crossword puzzles that are riddle based , the answer being in the sentence of the clue in this manner is standard . The way your version is worded , the answer pops out at you quite easily . That does n't necessarily mean it is n't the right version , just that it is a very simple riddle to figure out if you look at it as a ' riddle ' . The " Riddlers " answer being ' say ' makes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also noted , even if you read the letters separately , G-R-Y , you are reading Gee , Are , Why , not Gee , Or , Why . And he says the original version is worded " something we ' say ' everyday " . Well , a one of the rules of a riddle is that it is a true statement . And that would not be , as I might Not use the word ' SAY ' everyday . Anyway , yours seems the most logical to be correct , and all these in-depth theories about this ' riddle ' makes me think these people have too much time on their hands . ( Just joking here , nothing personal ) <p> Ronski writes : just to help along the gry explanation - would n't the answer be even more simple .. as in a word that SOUNDS like " gry " ... like the word AGREE ? <p> From Stephanie - Darons right . The answer is Dictionary . " You use it everyday and you know what it is . If you have listened carefully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The OLD ENGLISH DICTIONARY was spelled DICTONAGRY . I never would have thought of that . I guess if you say the riddle wrong , you never will come up with the correct answer . Say the riddle again but use , " In the old English dictionary there are three words that end in GRY . You now have the answer ! Cool . <p> Here 's a different way to solve it from Manny- Has anyone ever suggested that GRY was an acronym ? And the object used every day is a stoplight . Therefore GRY stands for Green , Red , and Yellow . <p> From Mark- well , 2 possible answers , in the first version that is wrong , the answer is Three , three is the 3rd word , and that is so convenient . However , In your version you say is the original , the third word in the entire puzzle is " words " and everyone in the world uses words except for the click languages in Africa I think . <p> geoff has researched words ending in the letters g @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see his list , click here <p> Nancy writes- Maybe Dictionary.com is n't as great as they say . A lot of dictionaries leave out some words as they did for this one . The answer is Onegry . It 's a real word .

The only word used 3 times in the whole thing in the original version is SAY here 's the original version . I will underline the important sentence in #1 then the answers in #2 will be capitalized and underlined. #1 . ) " Think of words ending in -GRY . Angry and hungry are two of them .

If you send this to 5 people they WILL pop up on your screen . What is " it " ? A " word " . What is the third " word " ? Another " word " . Of course , all of the possible answers to this riddle are also more " words " . " Words " will make you so MAD ! <p> From The Riddle Nut : The answer is language . There are some sentences in the riddle to trick you . I did this riddle in my class room , and my teacher helped us figure it out . I will highlight the words to help you in blue and the ones that do n't in green . " Think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two of them you what it is . " If you looked at my hints you will see that the third word in " the English language " is language . <p> From Robin : this only really works with this version . the answer is ' AGREE ' . As a spoken riddle this works very well . The line ' The third one everyone uses every day and knows what it stands for . ' describes the word , i.e everyone ' AGREES ' about the words meaning , and it is a common word , either in the form ' AGREE ' or any other way we show we agree with people . <p> From Onechatterbox98- The riddle is misleading a lot of you . It ca n't be GRY because it is to small . Something that small would be lost and the word has not been used for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is TWO words ! Also everyone does not use it everyday ! There is French , German , Italian , ext . So that is not the answer either . So you ask what the answer is ? It is simple . There is no such thing . Because no one uses the same thing everyday . It is meant to give you a headache . It is like the riddle of the lying man . " I man walks up to you and says everything I say is a lie . Is he telling the truth ? " The riddler had lots of brain to send that . He canceled everything and all words out of the definition ! That is my answer to this riddle . <p> Pchacker- the answer is onegry <p> Kelly writes- the way I received this riddle it is written like this .... There are three words in the english language that end in " gry " ONE is angry and the other is hungry . EveryONE knows what the third ONE means and what it stands for .

I also believe that the ONE is capitalized for a reason ..... The word one is used as an amount .... saying one gry or " a " gry ... hearing the riddle and seeing the riddle is what makes the difference as the riddler said .... so you use a as in " a tree " or " a lightbulb " meaning one tree or one lightbulb ..... therefore one gry would be a gry ... and using the sound gry as in angry or hungry you would deduce the word is " AGREE " ... and ... something else I forgot to mention , in the riddle it said if you LISTENED carefully again telling you that it is the sound and not the spelling ........ <p> From Josh- I just wanted to say that the answer has to be language because it 's something that is used everyday .... even if you write instead of say it , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " or " what " because there is no guarantee that you use those words everyday but you have to use language everyday so I 'm just tell all of you that the only possible answers is " language " or daron might be right and it might be " dictionary " but it ca n't be anything else because if it was " and " then why would it say that angry and hunry are TWO of them ? ? ? this is my guess .... PS : did n't the creator tell anyone the right answer ? ? ( i doubt that the riddler is the creator ) oh yea i forgot to mention that even if the riddler was right and you are meant to read it out loud then when you got to the part where it says " what is the third word ? " then you would n't read it as a question and " what " would have to be the third word and that part that he added in the riddle that says " i have already told you the word three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writes : I have figured it out completely and it all makes since all you have to do is read the riddlers solution or hint in the riddle these phrases are stated , " there are three WORDS " , what is the third WORD " ( in the riddle ) , " and i have told you the answer three times already " ( the word WORD is said three times , in think of a word , and the third word , and the word is something . so simply the answer is WORD ! ! ! ! ! <p> And from Cheese2264- STOP ! ! you 're all right . Riddles change a lot , which often changes the answer , thus making it a completely different riddle. furthermore , many , many riddles have more than one answer . all of the above answers CAN be correct , so this particular riddle has many different answers , each of which probably says quite a bit about the person who gives that particular answer . There is no one correct answer . deal with it . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know that the key phrase is " the English language " Clearly the correct answer is the third word in the riddle , words .

" All of the " GRY " riddle versions ask the same question , and the question is - " What is the third word ? " and " What " is not the third word . <p> From Avalon - THE ULTIMATE ANSWER : As the Riddler has said that " The trick to this riddle is it was designed to be read aloud . The trick is the usage of GRY vs . G or Y ( pronounced G R Y ) Now you should be able to figure out the answer . " What the riddler means is that we should not think of GRY as one word but two letters which is " G " or " Y " . so we should not look for GRY but words ending with letter " G " or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them which end with letter " Y " . Therefore the word which he has used in the riddle is of course " SAY " which he has used three times and also ends with the letter " Y " . So finally the ultimate answer is " say " and there can not be any better answer then this . I would request the Riddler to come forward and please let us know if we have found the answer by now or Not . <p> Samantha writes : The answer to the GRY Riddle ... There is absolutely no exact or correct answer to this riddle . Do n't you get it ? The answer depends on how the riddle is interpreted and there is no correct way for riddles to be interpreted . It 's like a math problem that gives you too little information , so that there are many possible answers .

I was inclined to go along with the cleverness of " language " , but it seems that may depend on the wording that many people do n't accept . I recently saw your site and the discussion of S or Y and say , This intrigued me , as the many of the early forms of say end not only in y , but in g or a yogh , the middle English letter that resembles the number 3 and developed into modern forms with either y or g . I 'm not offering this as a solution , but in light of the " 3 times " hint , it might be interesting to consider @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd like to say that if I knew how much debate existed surrounding the -gry riddle I would never have accessed the site ! I would never have thought so much debate over a silly riddle could be so addictive to read ! Anyway , joking aside , I just wanted to add to the idea that the " -gry " aspect of it could mean " g or y " . If this were the case why would there would be a hyphen , " - " . This suggests it is a suffix , so does n't this indicate it the stem of a word , rather that a " g or y " type thing . I may be wrong , but thought it worth considering . <p> Lori in Ohio writes : Simplifying everything , what I hear , see , and what just makes sense to me in this riddle are two lines : WHAT is the third word If you have listened carefully , I have already told you WHAT it is .

@@28870707 @2570707/ <p> From time to time we come across a riddle that is perplexing and challenging almost to the point of frustration ! Just as we are ready to pull out our hair that elusive solution comes - and shouts of " I get it now ! ! ! " are heard . The following riddles are variations of the same basic problem - it 's a weighty one - but worth it . We suggest you read and try to solve the first one and continue with the others in order given as each variation is just a little more difficult - at least we thought so . And now , the first of " weighty problems " : <p> 1 . BAGS AND BEADS <p> You are given 5 bags . There are 10 beads in each of the bags . In four of the bags , the beads each weigh 10 grams . In the remaining bag , each bead weighs only 9 grams . All the bags and beads look identical . You must find out which bag has the lighter beads . The problem is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look identical . You can use a scale , but it has to be a single-tray scale , not a two-tray balance scale . Also , you may use the scale only once . How can you find out which bag has the lighter beads ? <p> Now you should be able to solve this variation , no problem : You have 10 bags of gold coins , 10 coins per bag , 10 grams coin , but one bag of coins weigh only 9 grams per coin ( because of low quality ) . How do you find out which bag contains low quality gold coins ? You may use a scale only one time . Thanks to Jason Vuong for this variation ! <p> You have 9 marbles : 8 of them weigh 1 ounce each ; 1 weighs 1.1 ounce . The 9 marbles are all uniform in size , appearance and shape . You have access to a balance scale containing 2 trays - you may use the balance 2 times . You must determine which of the 9 marbles is the heavier one using the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ COINS This one is a little more difficult because you are not told if the object is heavier or lighter . <p> You have 9 gold coins . All 9 coins look exactly the same but one coin is a fake and is either lighter or heavier than the other 8 coins . You have a scale - balance type with 2 trays - but can only load it twice . How do you find the fake gold coin ? <p> Now , if you have been able to solve the four problems above , this final weighty problem should be " no problem " for you to solve ! This one is taken from a book : More Games for the Super Intelligent by James F. Fixx . We think it is the most difficult ! <p> You have 12 identical-looking coins , one of which is counterfeit . The counterfeit coin is either heavier or lighter than the rest . The only scale you have to use is a simple balance . Using the scale only three times ( Note : not loading , but using for balancing ) , find the counterfeit coin .

Latin translation for sea is mare . March starts with it , December has it near the end . Peace and war neither have it . Many has it , few does not . Latin translation for shadows is umbra. 2004 is MMIV . <p> And for another way to look at this , Bryan writes - I believe the answer to riddle 3 is " Mirror " . The biggest clue comes from the line " You find me neither in peace nor war " . The words " peace " and " war " are political opposites ; an era is either a time of peace or a time of war , and they are mutually exclusive . Thus for something to be in neither peace nor war means it is not in anything at all , which is nonsensical . It makes more sense to look at the actual words " war " and " peace " , implying that the author is hiding clues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can go line by line : " I am in the sea BUT not in the water " - you can see your reflection on the surface of the ocean but it is not actually in the water . " I start in March and end in December " - here the author plays with the words " March " and " December " ; the beginning letter in March is " M " and the ending letter in December is " r " , the beginning and ending letters in " Mirror " . " You find me neither in peace nor war " - again wordplay . " Mirror " can not b e spelled using letters from " peace " or " war " , and there is absolutely no symmetry in the structure of these words . " Many have me but few do n't " - most people have mirrors , but there are still people living in places that have none ( e.g. African tribes ) .

We protect you all the time . Yet you treat us badly . You burn us in public buildings to make you seem better . You try to make us straight but most of us refuse usually . When we are dead , you are pleased . Yet , when we are gone , you are sad . What are we ? <p> ANSWER : We received two answers in equal proportions for this one : trees and hair <p> A man has to take two pills each day , at the exact same time or he will die . If he only takes one or he takes two of the same pill he will die . Both medications look the same and are the same weight . One day he drops both open pill bottles scattering the pills across the floor . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he take his pills so he wo n't die ? <p> ANSWER : First the man must take a scale and find the exact weight of two of the pills . Since the pills on the ground are randomly mixed , there is no possible way to seperate them again . The solution is to go one step further in their mixing . Since the medications were of identical weight , and the man was taking one pill from each medication every day , half of the mixed pills will be from each medication . The man should take the two pills remaining in the bottle and place them in the pile , then grind all of the mixed pills into a powder . The powder should be mixed so that both medications are equally distributed throughout the powder ( in the manner a pharmacologist measures out pills ; the actual medication only amounts to a small percentage of the actual pill ) . With enough mixing , a sample of this powder will contain 50% of one medication and 50% of the other , a result from Probability . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or simply ingest the powder , as long as the amount of the mixture he takes each day is equal in weight to the weight of two of the old pills . Ideally , he would now take one pill each day which is twice as large as either of the former pills . This way , he receives the same amount of each medication he would have as if he were to take two of the old pills . -Thanks to Bryan for this great explanation ! <p> What do the following words have in common ? screen , inflammable , dust , left <p> ANSWER : These words are " self antonyms " ; each word has two meanings that are opposite of each other .

We have received many very good solutions/suggestions . Here is the simple one : From Stephanie -The answer is not a math principle , but the principle of math hard at work . Why is 2 + 2 and 2 x 2 the same answer ? You can spend hours looking for a complicated solution but , quite simply this is just how math works . <p> Somehow that answer disappoints me and many math fans , and there is some basic math going on in the riddle . Eric reports this : It is called the additive inverse property of multiplication . I asked my Calculus teacher who has a doctorate degree in Mathematics . <p> ........ Now , that sounds more like it ! <p> And Dipanwita helps it along offering this - This is the solution to the 4 prices riddle . It is NOT just these 4 prices .... the answer is : Take ANY 3 numbers and divide their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such that all 4 will add to and multiply to the same . So , e.g. , take 3.5 , 5.95 , 2.15 . Their sum is 11.6 . SO the fourth number is 11.6/ ( 3.5 x 5.95 x 2.15 ) -1 = 0.265 . <p> ....... Now we are getting to the nuts and bolts of this riddle . It seems like a coincidence , but it really is not . <p> And Corey responds with - The numbers are not just a coincidence ... They are quite easily derived as follows : <p> Say you have a group of N-1 numbers . Simply take the current sum and divide by ( the current product minus 1 ) to get the remaining number . <p> I see this as the fundamental principal relationship between the numbers of the $7.11 problem . The " integer number of cents " requirement then just reduces the possible combination of numbers . <p> ........ Still with me on this one ? ? ? ? <p> Michael solves it this way : We know two facts in this riddle : all four numbers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Our object should be to find an equation for all values for which this statement is true , and then the mathematical concept will become evident . So let 's assign a variable to each of the four values given : x - 1.20 y - 1.25 z - 1.50 w - 3.16 <p> These two equations will tell us every value for x , y , z , and w for which the riddle is true . Unfortunately , those two graphs have four variables , meaning the resulting graph is in four dimensions . We can only graph this in our heads , and certainly ca n't find any values for x , y , z , and w . But we do have two equations relating x , y , z , and w to a constant , 7.11 , so we can solve for a variable in one equation and plug it into another . I will solve for w : w + x + y + z = 7.11 w = 7.11 - x - y - z <p> Now we plug that value of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - y - z ) ( x ) ( y ) ( z ) = 7.11 <p> Now we only have 3 variables , and this three dimensional graph will tell us all possible values for which the riddle is true . We can graph this equation on a TI-89 calculator , but the equation has to be expressed in terms of z first . This requires some pretty messy algebra . We 'll start by dividing both sides by ( x ) ( y ) : ( 7.11 - x - y - z ) ( z ) = 7.11/ ( x ) ( y ) <p> We now have everything we need to use the quadratic formula ( z= ( -b+or-(b2-4ac)1/2 ) /2a ) A = 1 ( the coefficient in front of the 1st term ) , B = x + y - 7.11 ( the coefficient in front of the second term ) , C = 7.11/xy <p> Using the quadratic formula , we get that z = ( -x-y+7.11 +or- ( ( x+y-7.11 ) 2-28.44/xy ) 1/2 ) /2 , or two planes . Every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the three values for x , y , and z in the riddle are on the plane . Plug them back in to either of the original equations to find w . The mathematical concept used in this problem is graphing in the third dimension , or more generally , multi-variable calculus . <p> .... But wait ! Jason writes- This is just a simple algebra equation . You can make up any numbers that you want and still come up with the same effect if you balance the equation . Below is the equation being used : a+b+c+d = a*b*c*d So if you want to create your own problem with the same effect do the following : 1 . Write down any numbers that you want and as many number that you want . 2 . Add them all up on one side and multiply them all on the other side ( of the equation ) . 3 . One the left you have some sum plus " x " and on the right you have some product times " x " . 4 . Solve for " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them all together . <p> ANSWER : Ok , for the simple answer : the " Fertile Crescent " . That was the most commonly given answer by far for this riddle . One interesting explanation for the answer came from ' Jim ' and is as follows -- <p> The big problem with this riddle is that there is no definite question . What exactly are they looking for ? While the answers to different parts are known , which did the author intend to be the final one or is it a piece by piece riddle . <p> " In my cradle Were you raised " Refers to the " Fertile Crescent " where today 's major religions come from aka the middle east area , Jerusalem , Babylon , Syria etcetera ( sorry about the horrible spellings ) <p> " My three sons Now grown apart " Are the three major religions to come from there aka Judaism , Muslim , Christianity . Now the pieces of my heart part can be either God , aka Gods love being corrupted by holy wars . Or Abrahams heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Isacc , Ishmeal , and great great great .... grandson Jesus , vieing for predominece in the world through religious powers . <p> I hope this helps you out . <p> Also , another intriguing solution from Lavette - ? .... I am not sure about this one but it reminds me of something i learned about wood . In my cradle is where i would put my wood to cure for 13 days then split it into three pieces to the center heart of the wood only to be thankful that i had it on a cold day to warm me through to my heart . <p> .... and Lavette also noted - i have already submitted my solution as wood but after further research i feel i need to update it . I still believe it is wood . In my cradle is where it would lay , not for 13 days but 1 year to season not cure , being 13 days of full moons each year , hence fruitful moon completing it 's full cycle . when wood is seasoned for that long it automatically splits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ properly split it will fall into 3 pieces . referred to as sons , not in the feminine because the fruit of the tree represents the female and the trunk or wood is the male hence sons . to vie for pieces of my heart can refer to the heart of a fire or in Indian terms the fire is in the heart of the dwelling , also a fire it 's self is started with kindling and the finest choice of wood to create the heart of the fire . i believe if you look into this you will find it is correct information on fire wood , generally hard woods . i can see where some would answer the fertile crescent but this is far more specific . hope you choose to publish ... if you respond who is author ? sounds like a Quatrain from Nostradamus lol. but definite astronomical term to identify 13 cycles of moon each year being 13 days in total . every line fits . <p> ... and Lavette adds - after considering fertile crescent i realized it is only part of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always refered to a full moon as a fruitful moon , have n't heard this any in modern usage . The answer is Jerusalem , it lies within the cradle of the fertile crescent and her 3 sons are Judaism , Islam and Christianity which have grown apart all claim their roots to be in Jerusalem yet in one year or 13 lunar cycles or since Islam came into being 1300 yrs . ago approximately ( a thousand years is as a day ) now are they grown apart yet all three vie for a piece of her heart or her old city as it is known or the temple mount it 's self . again sounds like Nostradamus prophecy lol . <p> And thus , riddle solvers , this one is solved ! <p> Although broken , they will always exist and surround us . We do n't like being confined in them and they will outlive us all . What are " they " ? <p> ANSWER : The best answer for this one is " rules " or " laws " . Others have solved it with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or laws seems to answer best . <p> I discovered that I made a mistake on a check as I was paying bills . To destroy this check , I decided to cut it into pieces and this question came to mind : If I do not place any cut pieces of this check on top of each other and if I do not fold this check or any of the pieces , what is the largest number of pieces I can cut this check into and how many cuts will I have to make to do this ? <p> ANSWER : There would actually be an infinite number of cuts as one could technically keep cutting the pieces - limited only by the ability of the cutter to make the cuts . But the simple answer is - only 2 pieces and 1 cut *because* after you make that 1 cut , you no longer have the " check " you started with !

With all the thought that has gone into this little riddle , you may be disappointed at the answer , but here is what we believe that answer is : <p> " Cut the pages in half and you now have two halves . We all know that two halves make a whole - so there you are , climb though the " hole " and you 're out ! ! <p> There are 5 hats . Three are blue , two are red . They are placed in a box and mixed up . Three people are blind folded and standing in a line one behind the other facing forward . Each person reaches into the box , one at a time and withdraws a hat which is then placed on their head . Their blind folds are then removed . The first person in line knows the color of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does she know this ? ( she can not turn around and look behind her and they can not speak ) <p> ANSWER : The text of the riddle is corrupted . First , the last of the persons in line ( who sees the other two ) says : I do n't know what is the color of my hat . Then the second says : I do n't know what is the color of my hat . <p> The first in line reasons as follows : If both me and the one in the middle had red hats on , then the third person would know that he has to wear blue , since there are only two red hats . So me and the second guy do n't wear two red hats . So we either wear two blue , or a red and the blue . <p> Now the second guy can figure as much as I did , so if I was wearing a red hat he would know that he has to wear blue . He does n't know what is the color of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so I must wear blue ! <p> This one if from a visitor , Carl , and though it is not really " unsolvable " , he presented it in such a great way , it is offered here for your enjoyment ! It 's a great riddle and using a little logic , you should be able to solve this one - <p> Once upon a time there was a ruler in Persia who had a very beautiful daughter . When it was time for her to be married , the marriage was arranged by her father as was the custom in that part of the world . Many young men came to be interviewed by the ruler , but no one person was perfect for the princess . After several months , the ruler finally decided that three princes from nearby kingdoms were suitable for the princess . Since each one was equal to the other in wealth , personality , manners , looks and intelligence , the princess 's father had to devise a way to differentiate between them and declare one as the man who would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them to his palace and brought them to a room , elegantly furnished and with a single round table about 2 meters in diameter . There were three chairs around the table , equally spaced from each other . He bade them each take a seat . By this time , the three princes were puzzled by the secretive behavior of the ruler , ( and I do n't mind telling you ) , a little apprehensive . But the ruler smiled and proceeded to explain to them that he considered each of them to be equally qualified to marry his daughter , so he had created a game to determine which one would win the hand of his daughter . <p> He produced three elegant scarves , woven of the finest silk and blindfolded each prince with them . Then he proceeded to explain that he had in his hand a contained of lampblack . This was a very common ingredient of the day , as it was used to make a sort of ink . But in its dry form , it could be used to make a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with his forefinger , made a mark of " X " on each mans forehead . As he explained to them , he MAY or MAY NOT have lampblack on his finger as he made each mark . Thus , each man could have a black " X " on his forehead or could have no visible mark at all . But he told them also that one or more of them had a black mark . <p> Now , said the ruler , take off your blindfolds . As each man did and became accustomed to the light , the ruler said , " The first man who can correctly tell me whether he has a black mark or not will be the man who will marry my daughter , the princess . You may not touch yourself or each other or move from your chairs . " <p> Seeing that neither he nor the other two had an immediate response , after a short time , one of the men stood up and correctly stated how his forehead was marked , and , was declared the winner . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black " Xs " . <p> How did the winner determine he was marked with a black " X " rather than no " X " ? <p> ANSWER : ( corrected thanks to Chad ! ) The reason he deduced he had one was because basically he was the first to realize this ; Let 's call him A and the losers B and C. IF B and C did n't have x 's , then A would know right away because at least one person has one . IF B had one and C did n't then A would also know that He has one because B would have come to the same conclusion ( i.e. A and C do n't have one so I must ) Knowing these two facts and knowing that both B and C would have figured these two fact out as well , since there was no response , then A naturally deduces that He Must have an X as well . Had nothing ... absolutely nothing with them trying to trick him . <p> Jimmy 's math teacher asked him to multiply three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? <p> ANSWER : 12 , three times <p> From Matt - This must be one of the hardest math riddles there is. which means " i do n't have a clue " <p> here is how it goes . <p> there is a row a soldiers that is 1km in length . and they walk with a constant speed in a straight line , in 1 direction . <p> all the way at the end walks a messenger . he has to bring a message to the captain walking all the way at the beginning of the row <p> the messenger starts walking past the soldiers and immediately turns around when arriving at the captain and walks back to the end of the row . when the messenger is back at end . the hole group of soldiers traveled a distance of 1000 meters . <p> the soldiers and captain are walking at the same constant speed . and the messenger ( walking faster then the soldiers ) is also walking a a constant speed . <p> you do n't know anything about time or speed . <p> question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the end of the row to the beginning and back . <p> please do n't try to do this by head . you 'll probably need a calculator and a few sheets off paper . <p> ANSWER : Here is the simple answer - The answer to #7 is really very simple . The messenger has to have traveled 2 km . It does n't matter what speed they walked at . At the beginning af the puzzle , the line is 1 km long . The general is therefore 1km ahead of him . He must therefore travel more than 1 km to reach the general . Since the line moves 1000 m , or 1 km forward , the end is where the beginning was . Even if he walked 1.5 km to the general , he only has to walk .5 km to get back to the end of the line . It goes faster going back , because now they are coming towards him , and not going away . <p> AND NOW FOR THE MORE CALCULATED ANSWER : <p> Let 's denote the speed of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ messenger by V. Let t1 denote the time it takes the messenger to reach captain and t2 the time it takes him to get back to the end of the line . <p> The troop has travelled 1000m in time ( t1+t2 ) , so : <p> 1000m = W ( t1+t2 ) <p> t1+t2 = 1000m/W <p> At the same time both in time t1 and t2 the messenger travels 1000m relative to the column , so : <p> t1 = 1000m/ ( V-W ) <p> t2 = 1000m/ ( V+W ) <p> This gives equation : <p> 1000m/W = 1000m/ ( V-W ) + 1000m/ ( V+W ) <p> When you divide the numerators by 1000m , the denominators by W , and denote V/W by A you obtain : <p> 1 = 1/ ( A-1 ) + 1/ ( A+1 ) <p> A2 - 1 = 2A <p> Solving that quadratic formula for A you obtain 1+sqrt(2) and 1-sqrt(2) . Since V/W ca n't be negative it turns out V/W = 1+sqrt(2) . <p> Filip has offered this solution - I think that the easier solution is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ppl are walking forward , so then in order to get to the captain and back he must have walked diagonally towards the captain , and halfway ( 500m ) he reached the captain , and then walked diagonally back which is another 500km. so basically he made 2 triangles . Imagine the row of soldiers at the beginning as one side of the triangle and the 500m they travelled ( halfway ) at the bottom the other side , so basically you have this now : now the line missing is the distance travelled by the messenger halfway through the walk . so let 's call the line of soldiers ( on the left ) A and the bottom line , ( line of distance 500m ) B , and the distance travelled by the messenger which connects the end of line A and the end of line B , line C. so now you got line A ( line of soldiers ) Line B ( distance travelled by soldiers 500m ) and line C ( distance travelled by messenger to get to the captain . to find out line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ multiplied by B squared ( 1000m x 1000m ) x ( 500m x 500m ) for simpler i 'll just turn it into km ( 1km x 1km ) + ( .5km x .5km ) 1km + .25km = 1.25km so u found out C squared , but now to find out a side from C u find out the root from 1.25 which is 1.118033989 so that 's how many km the messenger travelled to get to the captain , and to find out how much he travelled to get to the captain and back u multiply that by 2 1.118033989 x 2 = 2.236067977 <p> When you think about , its actually simpler and quicker : D i think this is the answer PLEASE ! ! ! ! I spent so much time on this , so please dun just ignore this , think about it , and add it to the possible answers : ) I 'm 14 from Canada , Toronto and came across this while looking for riddles : ) <p> Something that runs but never stops , it never gets tired nor walk .

Clues-it has no legs and the answer is two words <p> ANSWER : black hole or your shadow <p> Name five days of the week without saying - Monday , Tuesday , Wednesday , Thursday , Friday . <p> ANSWER : Got lots of suggestions for this one , but the simplest and the most obvious is the correct answer : day before yesterday ; yesterday ; today ; tomorrow ; and the day after tomorrow . <p> Bill said he can hang his hat , walk 100 feet , and shoot a hole right through the hat with a gun while blindfolded. how does he do it ? <p> ANSWER : He hangs his hat on his gun and shoots through it . <p> i am third , i can sense , and i am home of many . we are n't the same but we sound like we are . what are the three of us ? . i am third , i can sense , and i am home of many . we are n't the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the three of us ? <p> ANSWER : The letter C , the word SEE and the word SEA . <p> Eight men wanted separate rooms in a hotel but there were only 7 rooms available . The clerk said he could handle it and proceeded to assign the men to the rooms . How does he do it ? <p> ANSWER : This riddle has been on the unsolved page for a very long time and we have received many , many different answers for it . The most common solutions involved things like - assuming that two of the men were conjoined twins and would only need one room ; the clerk shooting one of the men ; naming the clerk as one of the 8 men ; giving the seven rooms at his hotel and sending the 8th man to the hotel across the street ; making the lobby into a room for one of the men ; calling the bathroom a " separate room " ; knowing that someone would be checking out while the clerk is checking in 7 of the men ; <p> So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those that stretches your thinking . For those of you who did a little thinking on this one , you will be disappointed at the answer - I know I was . I was expecting something along the lines of above - something like a " lateral thinking " riddle . However , it turns out that this riddle is a clever misdirection of words and really does n't have a logical solution , it 's answer just makes you think it is solved ( if that 's possible ! ) I know there will be many who do n't agree with this solution , but I do believe it is the solution intended and here it is : <p> The man says that he 'd like two of the men to wait in the 1st room . Then he assigns the 3rd man in the second room ; the 4th man in the third room ; the 5th man in the fourth room ; the 6th man in fifth room ; the 7th man in the sixth room . He now goes and gets one of the two he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man in the 7th room . Job done ! ! ...... or is it ? ? <p> Like I said , do n't think about this one for too long - if you do you 'll see the obvious error in thinking , ( and the ignoring of the real 8th man ) but at first you might agree , the clerk put 8 men in 7 rooms ! <p> Lots of fun thinking about this one and thanks everyone for helping ! Also , you might enjoy looking at this site for more info on this riddle : <p> A man was boarding the last flight to Las Vegas . As he came in , he tapped on the cockpit door and greeted the pilot , whom he knew as a friend . He then took his seat . Moments later , a SWAT unit burst into the cabin and hauled out the confused man for questioning . What was the name of the pilot ? <p> ANSWER : The pilot 's name is " Jack " and when the man greeted the pilot with " Hi Jack " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the SWAT was called and the story played out as described ! <p> What is the only plant that produces fruit , that a camper can carry into the woods full , but after the camper is too weak to carry it out empty ? " <p> ANSWER : A gas tank . In the riddle , the word " camper " means " mobile camping vehicle " instead of " person who camps " . The word " fruit " is a metaphor for the exhaust that a gas tank produces . A camping vehicle can be driven into the woods as long as its tank is full , but once the tank 's empty , it is now " too weak " to move anymore . <p> WHAT IS TALLER SITTING THAN STANDING ? <p> ANSWER : A dog or a cat . <p> How is the letter G like 12:00 ? <p> ANSWER : For this answer to work , you must know that 12:00 is referring to 12:00 Midnight ---- that said , you probably now easily see that G is in the middle of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . I then sat down to seek it . I brought it home with me because I could n't find it ! What am I ? <p> ANSWER : A splinter ! ( or thorn , burr , maybe poison ivy ) <p> What I am you will often find here ; you will never really have me - yet you will often give me up . What am I ? <p> ANSWER : Riddles ! <p> When the day after tomorrow will be yesterday , today will be as far from Sunday as today was from Sunday when the day before yesterday is tomorrow . What day is it today ? <p> Here 's a hint sent in by one of our visitors : This is a most confusing group of words . One visitor suggests that we interpret what the phrases mean - " day after tomorrow " really means " two days from now " . ... And " day before yesterday " really means " two days ago " .... Now , substitute : " two days from now " will be as far from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days ago . Does this help ? This visitor then followed by stating that today is Sunday . ANother hint - maybe it does n't matter what day - it could be any day of the week - all the words are there to confuse us ! ! ... and they do ! <p> ANSWER : It seems that the majority of visitors have reasoned that this riddle is filled with unnecessary information ( TMI ) and that the riddle is really quite simple and some have even commented " stupid " . Maybe clever because the answer to the question : " What day is it today ? " is whatever day it is that you happened to be reading this riddle . Yes , that is the answer - do n't believe me ? ? ? ? Write the days of the week on a piece of paper and work through the riddle . <p> And from another visitor : " My friend owns a huge multinational company , it strangely transports insects , he also loves word play , I guess that 's why he named the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ANSWER : Import-ant <p> My first is in endurance but not in health <p> My second is in richer but never in wealth <p> my third is in beggarwood but not in oak <p> my fourth is in neighbour but not in folk <p> my fifth is like a ring , going where it came <p> and my sixth is the second , exactly the same . <p> ANSWER : ( Finally ! ) From Scotty- I think that it might be the number 758905 . The answer has to do with the number of *different* letters in each word ( meaning , if the same letter appears twice , only count it once ) . ' Endurance ' has 7 , but ' health ' does n't have that same number . ' Richer ' has 5 , but ' wealth ' does n't . ' Beggarwood ' has 8 , but ' oak ' does n't . ' Neighbour ' has 9 , but ' folk ' does not . The digit 0 is kind of like a ring .

Even before the authorities open the door , they are certain the man did not take his own life . <p> The question to answer : What was the man 's cause of death , and why would n't he have died in 1989 ? <p> ANSWER : The man froze to death in 1994 ; had it been 1989 , he might not have froze because he lived in a warmer climate . OR : The man was electrocuted and had it been 1989 , well , his sentence had not been determined yet . <p> This riddle is one of those lateral thinking riddles where just about any scenario that ends with the man being found dead in 1994 would solve it . Makes you think .... <p> From one of our visitors : " Everything I say is a lie . ( Am I lying ? ) <p> ANSWER : This is a paradox and there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answer the question , but it wo n't answer the question - thus a paradox ! <p> Scotty offers this way to solve this one and it is a great answer---- The person would have to be lying . Here 's why . There are three possible patterns people could have about telling the truth . They could : ( 1 ) always tell the truth , ( 2 ) always lie , or ( 3 ) sometimes tell the truth and sometimes lie . If someone always told the truth , they would not say this , because if they did , in fact , always tell the truth , you could believe everything they said , but you could not believe this statement , since it 's not true about them . Therefore , an always-truth-teller would not say this . It 's also not possible that an always-liar would say this . Everything that an always-liar says is a lie , and since this statement would , in fact , be true about them , it would be impossible for them to say it . Now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Since they tell both truths and lies , it would be possible , whether it 's true or not , for them to say it . But it has to be a lie , since they said they only tell lies , when in fact they tell both truths and lies . Therefore , the person is lying . <p> ANSWER : the birds are candles on a birthday cake and it is their birthday so the older boy gets six candles cause he is 6 and the 4 year old gets 4 cause he 's 4 ! ! <p> I blind you , I give you food , I give you light , I give you death , I give you life , I am always there , I am never there .

Victoria explains- People always lie about their age , saying they 're younger than they really are , so people buy less candles . If they told the truth about their age , he 'd sell more candles . <p> A man weighing 190lbs. carrying three bowling balls weighing 5 lbs . each approaches a large ravine . The only way to cross the ravine is a bridge with a weight limit of 200 lbs . The ravine is too far to throw , roll , or float the balls across . How can the man cross the ravine in one trip , with all three bowling balls ? <p> ANSWER : When you read the riddle as it is written : " .. man weighing 190 lbs . carrying three bowling balls weighing 5 lbs . each ... " - this could imply that the man actually weighs 175 lbs . and with the bowling balls , weighs 190 . See how very important our grammar lessons are ? ? ? ! ! ! As such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But then , why have the riddle ? So , here is another answer , ignoring grammar : the man juggles the bowling balls - admittedly a challenging task - and therefore wo n't ever be over the weight limit . <p> When there is fire in me then I am still cold . When I own your true love 's face then you will not see me . To all things I give no more than I am given . In time I may have all things , and yet I can keep nothing . What am I ? <p> ANSWER : A mirror <p> I come in a pair , water , rain , rocks , and wind ruin me , what am I ? <p> ANSWER : The letter " r " <p> There are three men : a deaf man , a mute and a blind man . The mute saw the deaf man steal the blind man 's money . How does the mute tell the blind man about it ? <p> ANSWER : The mute would most likely use brail to convey to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whom . <p> I 'm a type of road , but if you separate me in a certain place , you will have 2 new words . 1 of these words is 8 letters in length , &amp; the other means ' eat ' . What am I ? ? ? <p> ANSWER : The road is " thoroughfare " and when broken apart , you have " thorough " and " fare " - which does n't really mean " eat " but it has something to do with eating . So we 're calling this one solved and note that the riddle most likely should read " &amp; the other means ' food ' " . <p> The age of Ann &amp; Bill now add up to 91 . Ann is now 3 times as old as Bill was at the time when Ann was twice as old as Bill is now . How old are Ann &amp; Bill now ? <p> ANSWER - Thankfully , a solution and explanation for this riddle . It really is just a simple math - well , maybe not " simple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solved this one ! Roy explains it this way : Ages are Ann = 63 , Bill = 28. 7 Years ago , they were Ann was 56 , twice the age Bill is now . 7 Years ago , Bill was 21 , Ann is now 3 times his age . <p> This is just a simple Algebra problem , 3 simultaneous equations : A = Ann 's Age now , B= Bill 's age , X = some number of years in the past . <p> The equations to solve are : <p> A + B = 91 A = 3 * ( B - x ) ( A - x ) = 2 * B <p> Ed provided this lengthy explanation , but thorough and we offer it for full explanation of this riddle : <p> The answer is that Anne is now 63 , and Bill is 28 . How does this come about ? Dust off your calculus books , kids , here we go ( excuse the length of this note , by the way . It takes some time ) ! First , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ age now , Y = Bill 's age now , A = Ann 's age ' then ' , B = Bill 's age ' then ' , and T = # of years between now and ' then ' . Here are the equations ' given ' to us by the question : X + Y = 91 A = 2Y X = 3B X - T = A Y - T = B <p> OK so far ? Here comes the math part . Since T = both X - A and Y - B , both of these equal each other , or : X - A = Y - B since X = 3B amd Y = 0.5A ( A = 2Y , same thing ) , we can sub in these values and get : 3B - A = 0.5A - B Multiply everything by 2 ( because you can ) and you get : 6B - 2A = A - 2B Now add 2B and 2A to each side , and you have : 8B = 3A Which means that B = ( 3/8 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good does this do us ? Well , we can then plug these values back into the equations above , and solve for T in terms of each individual variable . Confused ? Here 's the math to isolate T with B : T = X - A ---&gt; given T = 3B - ( 8/3 ) B ---&gt; sub in for A T = ( 9/3 ) B - ( 8/3 ) B ----&gt; 3 = 9/3 T = ( 1/3 ) B ---&gt; what we were looking for . <p> Ok , using a very similar method , we get that T = ( 1/8 ) A. Now we can sub in these values to isolate T with X and Y. Showing all the math for T with X : T = ( 1/3 ) B ----&gt;what we solved before T = ( 1/3 ) x ( 1/3 ) X ---&gt; since X = 3B , B = ( 1/3 ) X T = ( 1/9 ) X ---&gt; Hey ! this is useful ! <p> Ca n't resist adding this one from John - Ugh , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recognize that there are two different values for Ann 's or Bill 's age depending upon whether it is the part of the riddle that is talking about them in the past or whether it is talking about them in the present . The Difference in years from the past to the present ( which is n't given ) will be represented by the letter ' D ' . <p> Ann is now 63 ( 3 times as old as bill at start ) and Bill is now 28 = 91 years <p> AND , one more from John- <p> Ann and Bill now add up to 91 ==&gt; A + B = 91 Ann is now 3 times as old as Bill was at time x =&gt; A = 3 Bx At time x , Ann was twice as old as Bill is now =&gt; Ax = 2B <p> 3 equations and 4 unknowns - what is the forth equation ? . The difference between Ann 's age now and Ann 's age at time x , is the same as the difference between Bill 's age now and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - Bx <p> ANSWER : Tomorrow ! Another answer is " A contradiction " . And also , a human being . However , Jared writes : This is a correction to the amswer to one of your unsolvable riddles . The " I am what I am not " , riddle is actually the past . " Am " is a present progressive word , something that is . The past was , and is n't , and never will be- only was . Therefore , the past fits into both parts of the riddle saying " I am what I am not , " and " I 'm not what I am . " The past can not BE anything because it WAS . <p> What happens 4 times a week twice a month and once a year ? ( Corrected should read : What happens 4 time in every week , twice in every month and once in a year ? <p> ANSWER : The letter " e " . <p> There are 100 prisoners in a prison . In the center of the prison is a room with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rest of the prison ( i.e. no one can see in ) . The only thing the room contains is a sole light that can be turned on and off . The warden begins placing a random prisoner in the room each night , and let 's them turn the light on or off . He explains to the prisoners that if one of them comes to him , and tells him that all 100 of them have been in the room , he will let them go , but if they are wrong , all the prisoners will be killed for their stupidity . The prisoners are allowed to meet one night and discuss their plan , but they can have no contact from then on out . What plan can guarantee them success ? <p> ANSWER : Thanks to all of you who sent great solutions for this riddle . Almost everyone writes that the plan the prisoners must make is as follows : Each time a prisoner is put into this special cell , he must do something to prove he was there - and he must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chosen more than once ) . What that proof is - the prisoners agree on that during their once allowed meeting ; the proof could be a scratch on the wall , a fingernail left in a certain spot , a mark of some kind on the floor , etc . They have a light in the room so the light could be the reference point as to where to leave the proof . Each night , the randomly chosen prisoner will count the proof left and when 100 is attained , he gets to tell the warden that all 100 prisoners have been in the cell - they all go free ! ! <p> Interesting thoughts on this riddle : an obvious solution is that the prisoners have their once allowed meeting in that very cell - at that point each of the 100 prisoners will have been in the cell - hence they are free to go ! Also , the fact that the riddle says there is a light that can be turned on and off - most of you believe - and I agree - that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact that it can be turned on to count the proof and turned off so the guard wo n't see the proof readily . It seems the most difficult part of this riddle is for the prisoners to decide on how to leave proof they were in the room - but that is the key to this one . <p> A very simple Riddle , all you have to do is ask yourself - What would happen if you went to the root and just added water ? <p> ANSWER : Thanks to Tim who writes : <p> This riddle comes from the " Net Riddle " .

Who am I ? <p> ANSWERS : Marilyn Monroe . She was found dead in a Hollywood basement and was known as Norma Jean ? ? ( I ca n't recall the last name ) and her made name of Marilyn Monroe . OR , from Chris - the answer is a gossip columnist . The reference to the stars ' basement is analogous to things being leaked without their permission/knowledge by people whose job it is to sort through the personal lives and sordid details concerning the stars . Gossip has been around forever , and typically it is only the latest gossip that floats around , and even then it 's only the columnists that have the latest dirt that are listened to . The last part of the riddle seems to refer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ digging up their dirt , but will eventually get their information out via 2 genres -- television and print . Andrew offers this way of solving -I 'm not too sure on this one but I 'm thinking it 's the letter T. Travel the sTars - ( in the middle of = travel ) in a Hollywood basementT not the firsT ( and the last letter in this regard ( end of the word ' first ' ) ) I live on in Two genres Problems with this answer , i do not understand what " although i am gone " is implying . Which leads me to believe that my answer is wrong but hey , if it helps get it to the solved page to make room for the ones i can figure out , i 'm happy with that . : -D Tor suggests that the obvious answer is star trek or Enterprise And another visitor says that the answer is obviously " Elvis " . <p> So there you have it - no real definitive answer , but this riddle has to go ! <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see it with the NAKED eye . <p> If you take it out of a barrel it makes it HEAVIER not lighter . <p> We use this object EVERYDAY . <p> What is it ? <p> ANSWER : 99% of our visitors say the answer for this one is " hole " explaining that if you take a hole out of a barrel , you would make the barrel heavier . This riddle is very similar to another riddle we 've heard often : You can see it with the naked eye.When put into a barrel , it makes the barrel lighter even though the object itself is weightless . Thanks to everyone who helped solve this one ! ! <p> A man was in jail and had a visitor and when the visitor left the guard asked him who the visitor was , the man said , " I have no brothers or sisters , but that was my father 's son . " How could that be ? <p> ANSWER : As the riddle is stated , two best answers have come in . The first is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ technically his " brother " . The other is that the visitor is the son of the prisoner 's priest ( father ) . Perhaps the most logical solution is that the riddle is written incorrectly and as John states it : " Brothers and sisters I have none , but that man 's son is my father 's son . " That 's how it 's supposed to read . Thus the man visiting is the prisoner 's father . Good thinking - nicely done ! <p> A guy has to a cross a river filled with man eating animals , by climbing a bridge to get to a princess with whom he wants to stay for the rest of his life . but on the bridge is a guard who will chase him back as soon as he is spotted . the guard sleeps for 5mins and watches for 10mins and the guy can cross the bridge in 7 mins . How can he ever get to the princess at the top of the bridge without being spotted . <p> ANSWER : Lots of answers for this one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to fear - all he has to do is push the guard into the river - as the animals are " man eating " - the animals will eat the guard and the man can do what he wants . OR , the princess would be completely safe in the river since she is not a man and the princess could swim over to the man and then the man would not have to even bother with the bridge . <p> More traditional answers are : From Liam- A bridge is half a circle , so for 5 mins ( or less depending on the height of the hero ) .... say 2.4 mins crawling , he 's outa sight . He works out when the guard is gon na sleep , takes 2.3 mins off that , and sets off By the time the hero reaches tha apex the guard is asleep for 5 min , so the hero has 2.3 + 5 mins = 7.3 mins before the guard wakes up . Well within the 7 minute time AND , from many , many visitors ( thanks ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the guard goes to sleep the guy starts to walk across the bridge . As soon ( or just before ) the guard wakes up , the guy starts walking the OPPOSITE way . The guard , seeing the man walking back where he came from but not knowing this , immediately chases him and chases the man to his destination . It helps that the guy will have covered over half the distance before the guard wakes up . ( This is the most popular answer for this one . ) AND here is another popular way to approach this one- Because the princess is at the top of the bridge , it means that she is at the middle . Therefore , if she is at the middle , and he takes 7 minutes to cross the bridge , he can reach the middle of the bridge in 3.5 minutes . Therefore , while the guard is asleep for 5 minutes he can go and safely rescue the princess . Even if the guard wakes up , he will be already leaving with the princess in tow . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bridge by hanging on underneath the bridge - clever idea ! SOME of you said something like this : It says on the riddle that he has to climb the bridge and not cross it . If he climbs on top of the bridge , the guard will not spot him . My answer is that he has to climb the bridge to get to his princess . <p> there are 27 A. of the B. of R. what does A. stand for ; what does B. stand for and what does R. stand for <p> ANSWER : As the riddle is written - 27 Amendments of the Bill of Rights However , as Chris , Stacie , Mike , Leonard and Melanie note : the solution that you are supposed to give for this is as follows : There are 27 Amendments of the Bill of Rights . This is , of course , incorrect since the Bill of Rights is the first 10 amendments in the United States Constitution . There are , however , 27 amendments to the Constitution . If this is what they are getting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wordings : <p> 1 ) There are 10 A in the B of R. <p> 2 ) There are 27 A to the C. ( Thanks Chris ! ) <p> Another answer is 27 Acts in the Book of Romans . <p> As a worker , I 'm earning my pay <p> When I hear what the first people say . <p> Then I change every word <p> So the things that are heard <p> By the others can help make their day . <p> ANSWER : A gossip columnist . <p> Said the young girl , " My name is Isabella , and my <p> Grandmother has the same name . I am named after her , <p> but I know it to be true that she was just named after <p> me . " The girl is telling the truth . How is this possible ? <p> ANSWER : From Derek- The young girl has the same name as her grandmother but their middle name is different ie. Isabella Dawn ........ young girl Isabella Elizabeth ..... Grandmother The grandmother would be named after the young girl if there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : But the line that reads , " but I know it to be true that she was just named after me . " Seems to refer to the order in which the Isabellas of this riddle were disclosed . That is , in the introduction , the girl says her name ( referring to herself ) FIRST then introduces ( names ) her grandmother AFTER " me " ( the little girl ) . The JUST gives the " reading " of this riddle this way some weight . <p> What has : <p> 14 legs <p> 4 heads <p> 8ears <p> 30 fingers <p> 2 tails ? " <p> ANSWER : This riddle received several answers - it seems to be one of those riddles that would be classified as " pretty silly " so here are the silly answers : <p> From John - " Two men selling corn on the side of the road . " Legs : Two a man , plus two three-legged stools that they 're sitting on , plus the four-legged table on which they 're selling the corn . ( 14 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them has two quarters in his pocket , each of which has a ' heads ' side . ( 4 ) Tails : The other sides of those coins are , of course , ' tails ' . ( 2 ) Ears : Two a man , plus the four ears of corn they 're trying to sell . ( 8 ) Fingers : Ten a man , plus five fingers each from two people that flipped them off as they drove by . ( 30 ) There . It may not be the ' right ' answer , but it 's nothing if not creative . <p> From Jordan- 3 people ( 3 heads , 6 ears , 6 legs , 30 fingers ) at a table ( 4 legs ) , one is sitting at a chair ( 4 legs ) eating 2 ears of corn , 1 head of lettuce , and the 2 standing are waiters , each wearing a tux with a tail ( 2 tails ) <p> Africa . each " hunter " was able to photograph only two animals , each of <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hunter colleagues . <p> A ) Each animal was photographed by exactly two of the men . <p> B ) Each hunter photographed at least one member of the cat family ; and Eli and Gary accounted for all four cats between them . <p> C ) Gary and Peter both filmed a leopard . <p> D ) The namesakes of the animals that eli captured on film both photographed a gazelle . <p> E ) Tae did not photograpgh any of the animals that Peter did . <p> F ) Gary and Ted had photographs of the same animal . <p> Who caught the lion on film ? <p> ANSWER : This is really just a simple logic problem and to solve you need to create a grid and then plug in the facts . You will be able to deduce that Eli &amp; Leopold got the lion .

Secondly , He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that your mother was in the same room with when you were born . This is obvious . The same reasoning would apply to anyone . Except if you were born in the forest or were a test tube baby . Here the riddle rephrased:An old professor was chatting with a young student when suddenly the student looked at the professor and said since you seem to know it all I will make you a bet . While the student raised his hand as if to shake hands with the professor very convincingly he said " I will bet you , that I was right there , ( when I assumed ) when you were born and " I mean completely correct in presuming " you were in the same room with you . " The professor replied , " But son I am over twice your age and it would be impossible for you to be have been there .

Thousand Billion Octillion Hundred One Four Eight 3 Three Thousand is the first number with the letter " a " in it . Billion is the first number with a " b " in it . Octillion is the first number with a " c " in it . etc ... So then three would be the next number in the sequence because it is the first number with a " h " in it . <p> Here is another quite different way to answer this one : From atrice - The next number is 1(2/3) . The pattern lies within the number of zero triplets. 1,000 has one set of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 1+3=4 , 1 sextillion has 7 sets of three zeros , 1+7=8 , and 100 only has 2/3 of a set of 3 zeros , 1+ ( 2/3 ) =1(2/3) . <p> 4 .

The end for some ( some drown ) beginning for others ( aquatic animals ) and the plunder refers to lost treasures from sunken ships . Melanie offers : I think this is the sea ! It is the home to some but not others , it is below us but above sea critters . Now that I have typed this I am unsure this is the right answer . Hope it is . Michelle writes : Dirt or Ground it lies beneath us but not to some above- corpses and creepy crawlies perhaps is home to many - ie , worms and things but not the dove- so we know it is n't above us means death to some -- again corpses beginning to other- vegetables etc @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find your plunder-- as in buried treasure Jon and Chery say- The answer is a coffin that is buried underground Sue offers : Water is below us , for the largest portion of water lies under sea lvl .

A horse travels a certain distance each day , strangely enough two of it 's legs travel 30 miles each day and the other 2 legs travel nearly 31 miles . It would seem that 2 of the horse 's legs must be 1 mile ahead of the other 2 legs but of course this ca n't be true since the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ANSWER : Two thoughts on this one . The most common answer is that the horse is traveling in a circle or oval pattern and the inside legs would travel a shorter distance . Also , if the horse starts with it 's front feet on a line , and starts walking , if the front feet are marked at having travelled 30.75 miles , then the front feet have almost traveled 31 miles , and the hind have traveled 30 miles . &lt;- the hind legs have travelled 30 miles , but have not yet traveled 31 miles Additionally , John offers this as the " real " solution : This just has to do with how horses back legs move when they gallop . If you watch slow-motion footage ( or if you know a tidbit or two about horses ) , their hind legs do n't go straight forward and back like their front legs do . The hind legs move in an oval pattern- More or less straight back on each stroke , but then sweeping outward in an arc away from the body before coming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a longer distance with each step . I heard this very riddle long ago from a rancher , and he gave me the answer I 've just given you . Though personally I think the , ' walking in a circle ' answer shows imagination ... <p> 17 . From Mike : City A and City B are on either side of a river but not directly across from one-another . You must build a bridge perpendicular to the river banks to create the shortest distance between the 2 cities . The bridge does not go through where a straight line would be drawn between the 2 cities , and there is no geometric solution to the problem . <p> ANSWER : Assuming the two cities are right on the bank of the river , it does not matter where you place the bridge , as long as it is between the two cities . This also assumes , of course , that the river is completely straight and the banks are parallel to each other . The reasoning is this , with the river and a sample bridge drawn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> <p> B <p> You will always have to move the same distance East-West ( horizontally ) , and also the same distance North-South ( vertically ) , regardless of where you place the bridge . So it does n't matter where you put the bridge . <p> 18 . MADRID has 2001 visitors each year .

@@28870849 @2570849/ <p> The facts in this riddle are clear : There is an initial $30 charge . It should have been $25 , so $5 must be returned and accounted for . $3 is given to the 3 friends , $2 is kept by the bellhop - there you have the $5 . The trick to this riddle is that the addition and subtraction are done at the wrong times to misdirect your thinking - and quite successfully for most . Each of the 3 friends did indeed pay $9 , not $10 , and as far as the friends are concerned , they paid $27 for the night .

By weighing 7 and 8 we obtain the answer , because if they balance , then 4 has to be light . If 7 and 8 do not balance , then the heavier coin is the counterfeit . <h> If when we weigh 1 , 2 , and 5 against 3,6 and 9 , the right side is heavier , then either 6 is heavy or 1 is light or 2 is light . By weighing 1 against 2 the solution is obtained . If however , when we weigh 1 , 2 , and 5 against 3 , 6 and 9 , the right side is lighter , then either 3 is light or 5 is heavy . By weighing 3 against a good coin the solution is easily arrived at .

@@28870871 @2570871/ <h> MOTHER 'S FAVORITE ! <h> This is a personal story about my little 4 year old daughter who makes Mother 's Day special every year and every day for me . This particular year I was outside looking at my young lilac tree and complaining that it did not have any flowers on it again . This was the third year the plant gave no flowers . My daughter watched me and listened and thought that I was really upset . I went on about how the neighbor 's lilac was full of blooms and what was I doing wrong ? We went inside and I did n't give it any more attention or thought . Later that day we went to the nursery to buy plants for spring planting . Scattered all over the ground were flower petals from various plants - having fallen off as they were being purchased .

@@28870874 @2570874/ <p> Years ago , a little riddle was developed which has caused many people to ponder endlessly for its solution . The origin of this riddle is unknown to us ( at " Just Riddles and More ... ! ) but it is probably the most frequently submitted riddle with no solution and because of this , we offer here what we think is the best solution . If you have a better one or different one , see below . To understand the " GRY " riddle , it is essential that you accept that riddles are simply brain teasers using word tricks . To be a riddle , there must be a trick in the wording or usage of words in the riddle . A riddle is not generally answered by a fact or information found in a reference book . Also , a riddle often uses a trick from magic - that is , misdirection - some of the words are there to mislead you to thinking about something else . Now , the problem with the " GRY " riddle being circulated currently is this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here below - read it and see if it is the version you have been pondering ) to something that absolutely can not be answered . There is no answer to this version of the " GRY " Riddle - and rightly so , seeing as how it is not the correct version ! This is the most commonly ( though incorrect ! ) version of the " GRY " Riddle : <p> " There are three words in the English language that end in -GRY . Two are HUNGRY and ANGRY . The third one everyone uses every day and knows what it stands for . If you listened carefully , I already told you what the word is . What is the third word ? " <p> So , what is the riddle here ? What is the puzzle ? If the above is NOT the correct version , what is ? ? The following is what we believe to be the correct version of the " GRY " riddle : <p> " Think of words ending in -GRY . Angry and hungry are two of them you what it is . " <p> OK , now let 's take this riddle apart and solve it as a riddle . Remember , that a riddle has a trick with the words or usage of the words . The trick in this puzzle is misdirection . There are words here that are meant to mislead you and they do just that . The first two sentences in the puzzle have nothing to do with the question being asked : " Think of words ending in -GRY . Angry and hungry are two of them . " Ignore these two sentences . They are there to mislead and distract you . Works does n't it ? ? ? Now , what is left is the " meat " of the riddle : @ @ @ @ . " In the phrase , the English language , the third word is simply the word ' language ' . There you have it ! ! Get it ? ' Language ' is definitely something everyone uses every day and in the phrase " the English language " is the third word ! OK , now you 're saying , " That ca n't be it ; too easy ! ! " But remember what a riddle is and that the " GRY " riddle is a riddle - NOT a trivia question . " Ok " , you 're saying , " But that is really stupid ! " Hey , we did n't write this riddle - but we do believe that we have the solution , stupid or not ! We do n't have actual statistics , but we can say that the " GRY " riddle has really gotten around over the last twenty years or so and we get MANY requests for the solution . As is the case with riddles , you need to listen or read them carefully before solving and before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ riddle got really distorted - hopefully this explanation will help and satisfy all of you who have been racking your brains for the answer ! <p> By the way , there really are words in the English language that end in -GRY . However , they are definitely obscure and to most of us unknown and rarely used . When have you used bowgry , hogry , hangry or aggry in everyday circumstances ? ( Remember the riddle clearly states that the answer is something used every day by everyone . ) So forget about using any of those obscure words ! Instead , start repeating the riddle in its correct version and be happy that you now know the solution ! <p> **36;168;TOOLONG SOLUTIONS FOR THE " GRY " **38;206;TOOLONG <p> David Yates writes : I 'm not sure how much research you did to solve the gry riddle but I believe your answer is incorrect . First all the words you provided as ending in gry ( hangry , bowgry , hogry , aggry ) I could only find " aggry " . Quoted from your site : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hungry are two of them you what it is . " The answer to the riddle is " GRY " definition : Anything very small , or of little value . ( we use this everyday ) not the word but the meaning of the word . <p> " The WORD IS SOMETHING that everyone uses every day " This statement does n't say " everyone uses the word everyday " . You said in your own definition of riddle that the statements are misleading , and possibly when this riddle was developed the word " GRY " was used more frequently then it is now , or maybe this riddle was made for English majors , or scrabble champions . You were correct in saying " .... ending in -GRY . Angry and hungry ..... " " Ignore these two sentences . They are there to mislead and distract you " they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ word . Well anyways there are my two bits . Maybe you can post more then one solution since " the true answer is unknown " , and let people decide the correct solution to use . <p> From The Riddler : I am the originator of the " GRY " riddle True , Language is the third word in the phrase " the English language " , but that is not the answer to the original riddle . You have some typos on your solution page but here is the solution to the GRY riddle . <p> The trick to this riddle is it was designed to be read aloud . The trick is the usage of GRY vs . G or Y ( pronounced G R Y ) Now you should be able to figure out the answer <p> " Think of words ending in -GRY . Angry and hungry are two of them . There are three words people say in the English language that end in G " or " Y. What is the third word ? The word is something that everyone will say every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I have already told you the answer three times . " <p> From Lloyd&amp;Rachel : Could n't the answer be .. GEE or WHY ? <p> Mick Royston writes : Look at the way " The Riddler " stated the riddle .. Think of words ending in -GRY . Angry and hungry are two of them . The riddler explained that it was G or Y , in other words either one ... Now the 3rd word could end with a G or a Y .. He told us the answer three times and if you look , the word SAY is in the paragraph three times AND it ends with Y ... Read it aloud and the answer is ( now ) obvious ... I had not figured this out until the Riddler gave the hint about G or Y. <p> From Anthony Wagenseil : This is the version of the riddle he received : This is going to make you so MAD ! There are three words in the English language that end in " gry " . ONE is angry and the other is hungry . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stands for . EveryONE uses them everyday , and if you listened very carefully , I 've given you the third word . What is it ? gry . Now , I spent a good time on this , fiddling around with every possible trick , every possible misdirection , every possible word play , and in the end , the answer I came up with just seems obvious . This is a version of the riddle you do n't have on the website , so maybe the answer 's going to be incorrect , but I think there just is no right or wrong answer ; it 's all in how the riddle is said and interpreted . Look at it this way ... Let 's take it sentence by sentence first . The first sentence can either be overlooked or the capitalized " MAD " can be taken as a hint . In the end , however , the " MAD " is not a hint , so let 's just ignore the first sentence entirely . The second sentence clearly states that it is the sound or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ word we are looking for , not some " G or Y " possibility . The third sentence tells us that two of the three words are " angry " and " hungry , " so we are led to believe that the third word will be " something-gry . " So we dig in our brains to find this word . USELESS ! Look at the entire riddle , and notice that every instance of the word " one " is capitalized . Unlike the " mad " being capitalized for emphasis , the " one " phonetically and emphatically makes no sense , so it must be assumed that the capitalization is a clue ! So I thought , maybe the word is " onegry , " or " fouronegry " or something , but none of those work . ( I also thought that maybe the SOUND of " gry " in the third word was not like the " gry " in " angry " or " hungry , " but more like a " gree , " so that " onegry " would sound like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anywhere and was incorrect anyways , so let 's get back to the real solution . ) The " ONE " is definitely a clue . The " everyONE uses them every day " clearly opposes the interpretation that " language " is the correct answer , as the quote refers to the three words , the third one being the answer we are looking for . Now , there is a word " gry " which means ***a measure equal to one tenth of a line , or anything very small , or of little value*** . I do believe " ONE " is a good clue to this definition ! " 1 " is very small or of little value ! Then , the riddle direction of putting something in the blank spot ... but ca n't the blank spot be blank intentionally ! ? I think so ! So , my answer ( also deduced by my friend Scott Minkin ) is that the third word is simply " gry " ! The only part of the riddle that does not make much sense is the part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what it means . I 'm sure it 's not a common word today , but maybe when the riddle was originated it was . So , voila another possible solution ! <p> Sarah from Canada writes : Find a huge dictionary . The word " gry " means ' small and miniscule ' . It definitely ends in -gry . It is said in the question . <p> pentony offers this answer : POWER-HUNGRY ! ENDS IN GRY ! ! ! ! ! ! ! <p> Mishayla offers this information : gry is a middle english word that has been out of use for around 300 years . It was roughly equivalent to 0.0008 of an inch , thus its ' something very small ' definitions elsewhere on your page . <p> Beth writes:The answer is Language ..... if you read it carefully .. it does not ask you to find another word ending in " gry " .... it says there are 3 words in " the english language " .... what is the 3rd eword ... it is LANGUAGE .... duh .. lol <p> Tony Palin solves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was that this riddle was designed to be read aloud . If you are n't looking for correct spelling ( gry ) , but rather the sound , the answer is simple : Agree . <p> Here is a new way to look at this riddle ! Lakshmiraj suggests : I think the answer to the GRY riddle is " what " because if you take a look at the fourth sentence ... What is the third word ? ... it makes sense . I think the question mark is supposed to be misleading and it is actually supposed to be a period . With this in mind , I think this is the answer . <p> From Tony : I think a better solution is the word " WORD " which is the " THIRD WORD " in the paragraph . Or in other words this " What is the third word " can mean the third word in the paragraph . <p> William Powell writes : This answer makes a lot more sense to me than your answer .... but take a look , tell me what you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this one before .... but it goes , there are 2 sentences that you focus on , and forget the other two . first : There are three words in the English language that end in -GRY second : What is the third word ? forget the rest ... and what is the third word in the first sentence ( or in terms of the whole riddle ) ? its three going by what you said , that it was created without a given solution , I do n't know for sure if this is right , but it definitely seems to make the most sense to me <p> hi i 'm Gabi from Israel . my answer combines a few of the leads i read on this page . 1st the Riddler 's suggestion that GRY actually means g " or " y .. then the assumption that a few sentences are misleading .. finally the last sentence says " i already told you what it is " . all these combined makes the answer so very simple ! look at the 5th sentence : " THE WORD IS SOMETHING @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ends with a " g " , and the writer TOLD us what it is ... <p> From ChrsChrisa : Even though the Word AGREE does n't end in GRY maybe the GRY is there to throw you off because if this riddle is said aloud then you hear GRY not G-R-Y . <p> From Alien5880 - I am not sure but it might be Y. It can be a word .... why . And look at the sentence everyone uses every day . y is used 3 timEs in three words . and everyone knows what why means . It is only a guess . <p> From Lori : I think there is no answer . In the original riddle it says " There are only three words in the English Language . " In that quote alone I used 9 words , therefore it is a fake . There is no real answer . <p> Chris offers this : It took me a few time to read . I read the version that The Riddler sent . I guess he made a few corrections . If you read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read it aloud , the answer is clear . The riddle SAYs three time . The word " SAY " was stated three times and ends in the letter " Y " , as in YRG or Y or G. SOooo ... I 'm guessing and assume , and am very sure , the answer is " say " . <p> Here is a great solution for this riddle ; read carefully , it makes sense- From Mike : The answer is " and " . The three words are " hungry and angry " . The phrase as a whole ends with gry . The riddle never stated that each word had to end in gry , just that the three words do . The fact that hungry ends in gry is just misleading . The third word - and - is a word that everyone knows and uses every day ! <p> From Dave : It never said to find another gry word it just said there are three words in 1 the 2 English 3 language . I hope this helps . So in conclusion I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is just a silly sentence . <p> From Sean : okay if the riddler is the originator of this riddle , and s/he truly intended the gry to be read out loud g or y , then the only answer is say . however the whole riddle does n't make any sense because gry read out loud translates to g are y not g or y. with that in mind say the riddle out loud to yourself . " think of words ending in g are y ... there are three words people say in the English language that end in g are y. " it no longer makes any sense anymore . <p> From MRSSC13- I read everyone 's " answers " and the one I 'm leaning more to is that the answer is " say " , it is the only word that the riddler put in " three times " , and he/she does say " if you have listen carefully I have already told you the answer three times " , so I think the answer is " say " , because unless you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a coma , or purposely force yourself not to talk , you WILL ... " say " something every day " ..... ( but hey , even some of us say things in our sleep ! ) What do you think ? <p> From Murrae : I tend to agree with Lakshmiraj , with regards to the solution being " WHAT " . It would be the solution to both versions you supplied . The question " What is the third word ? " is n't a question rather a statement , giving us the answer - what . Also , I believe that the text " I have already told you what it is " should be " I have already told you what is it . " Just a thought. *Note : good idea ! ! <p> From Jaysprock : did it occur to anyone besides me that gry is actually a word ? it is a measure equal to one-tenth of a line or anything very small , or of little value ( dictionary.com ) . <p> From Daaron : The answer is dictionary . About @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ English dictionary there are 3 words that end in G.R.Y ... " Through the years the riddle was changed to English language and dropped the #1 clue , " OLD " . Back in the 1700 's ( I think it was then maybe older ) the OLD ENGLISH DICTIONARY was spelled DICTIONAGRY . Believe it or not , they actually miss-spelled the book . Or at least that 's how it was spelled . The G was silent . It was then corrected or changed when the English language started to change . We now say you instead of ye or thee ect .... I was stumped on this riddle for years until I found this out . If you do n't get the riddle said right , you 'll never get the answer . <p> From Paul : Having Heard what the originator of the riddle had to say the answer is clearly three . He said he told us three times and different versions of the word three appear in the riddle . <p> From Gimmy Jon : I 'm not much on riddles any more . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you three times ' clue or statement in one of the riddle versions ) the following is the solution : <p> Do n't read " What is the third word ? " as a question , but as the answer : " ' What ' is the third word . " The " third word " is " what . " Therefore , " what " is the answer . Like the old Abbott and Costello routine : Who 's on first , What 's on second , I-Don't-Know is on third . I ca n't imagine going through a whole day without asking at least once : " What time is it ? " or " What do you want ? " or " What happened ? " or just " What ? " for clarification . Therefore , " what " is used by everyone , daily --probably . <p> From Bryan : Actually I always figured that the answer to the riddle is " what " . Since they tell you that Angry and Hungry are the first two ... then goes on to say " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already told you the answer " Take that to read I already told you the third word that they are looking for is What . Agree or not that is the answer that I came up with when a friend tried to stump me . It is still a good riddle . <p> From Susan : Well , I think the originator of the riddle should just come out and tell us , before we all go nuts ! My guess is the answer is " gry " . First of all , he/she says that THERE ARE THREE WORDS ... he does n't say that they are the only words ... just that there are 3 ... there could be 3 or there could be more ... but there are 3 . Then " GRY " is used in the riddle ... and as it 's been pointed out ... gry is a word ... not a commonly used word , but it 's still a word . And he told us what it was , because he used it in the riddle . The originator told us that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ implied that if we read the word GRY out loud ... pronouncing each letter ... then we would come up with G or Y. ( Maybe he has a bad accent ? Maybe he pronounces his r 's as " or " instead of " are " ? -who knows ... ) Well , then he says that the word is something that everyone uses every day , and that we know what it means ... Well , I think that in everyday conversation ( unless you just do n't say anything ) we all say at least one of those words ... " Gee " , " or " , " why " ... and if we all have a bad accent , like the originator ... we would spell " GRY " if we said those 3 word together ... and again , he told us what it was ... because in the riddle , he used the word " GRY " ( GRY is what 's misleading ... ) So , GRY is the answer ... either that , or we are all right ... depending on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one answer ... I think the originator of the riddle has WAY too much time on his hands ! ! ! : - ) P.S. The originator indicated that the clue was in " GRY " and if you count ... he did say GRY 3 times ... I still think that what I said before is true ... but here are my other reasons why I think it is GRY ... The message that I originally received ended with : Send this to 5 People and the answer will pop up on the screen automatically . Well , being gullible ... I did send it to 5 people ... but nothing popped up on my screen . Get it ? NOTHING And according to David Yates ... the word GRY means " Anything very small , or of little value " Well NOTHING is very small ... and it 's also of little value ... When the originator wrote in ... he told us that he told us the answer ... but he did n't tell us anything ... he just told us another riddle ... he told us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everyone used every day ... well ... who can go through a day , without using something small or something or little value ? ? ? -thus the meaning of the word , GRY . Gry was used in the sentence in the riddle ... so the riddler did tell us the word ... because he used the word ... but not in the way that we thought ... The answer is GRY , without a doubt ! ! ! Any one else ? Think I 'm right ? The message said I would get the answer when I passed it on to 5 people ... but I got GRY ... I got NOTHING ! ! ! <p> From Ravin : I believe I have come up with a solution to the -GRY riddle , possibly THE solution . Part of the riddle suggests the answer bright as day , it reads " Think of words ending in -GRY . Angry and hungry are two of them . THERE ARE ONLY THREE WORDS in the English Language . " Angry , and , hungry . Those are only three words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " angry &amp; hungry " ( angry and hungry as the two words " and " being the conjunction ) but after awhile you begin to see " angry , and , hungry " ( each as a seperate word ) . There for angry + hungry are two words , leaving " and " to be the third . This is my interpretation of the puzzle , I 'm sure others will see it as I do . Hopefully this solution will at least offer grounds for others to revise and come up with a better one . <p> Soulfly writes : I think I have figured something out think about this we use ( SLANG ) everyday it said There are only three words in the English launguage there is the word English , the word language in between both words is the 3rd word Engli s h lang uage ( slang ) <p> From C. W. - This may help with the solution to the gry riddle . As the Riddler stated it is meant to be read aloud and that is the key . Another example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one dies how many do you have ? " When read it is easy , twenty nine but it you say it aloud it sounds as though you are saying thirty six sheep not thirty sick sheep just like " gry " or " g or y " . Just trying to help . <p> Jason writes : I am just going by the riddle that the site claims that is the correct version , ignoring any other variations because they would make things more confusing . What the people on the board seem to be doing is looking too hard for the answer to the riddle . If you have to look at something besides the riddle itself then it is not the answer . So , you can stop thinking about the actual word " gry " being the answer or the old English version of dictionary , " Dictionagry . " The only way that these would even be a possibility is if the question was very old , and if it truly is that old then the riddle would have most likely lost any possible answer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what " being the answer . I find this to be unlikely , because riddles will use correct english in a riddle . So , to say that , " What is the third word ? " is actually a command is in reality cheating , because now you are warping the riddle by adjusting punctuation . " What is the third word ? " is a question due to it 's use of " what " an you what it is . " First , the riddle tells you to listen carefully so the answer must be inside these lines . Second , it says that there are three words in the English Language , so then it must one of those three . Finally , it gives you a logical hint of which one it is by saying , " The word is something that everyone uses everyday . " All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Conclusion , the answer to the riddle ( if there is one ) is most likely to be " Language " as this answer stays within the rules of riddle logic and it is actually found in the riddle . So , I whole-heartedly agree with the website and their answer . <p> From Thirsting- Your version of this riddle seems logical to have been the original . First of all , as you state , it is a ' riddle ' not a trivia question . Therefore , your answer , ' language ' makes the most sense as to being the right answer . When doing crossword puzzles that are riddle based , the answer being in the sentence of the clue in this manner is standard . The way your version is worded , the answer pops out at you quite easily . That does n't necessarily mean it is n't the right version , just that it is a very simple riddle to figure out if you look at it as a ' riddle ' . The " Riddlers " answer being ' say ' makes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also noted , even if you read the letters separately , G-R-Y , you are reading Gee , Are , Why , not Gee , Or , Why . And he says the original version is worded " something we ' say ' everyday " . Well , a one of the rules of a riddle is that it is a true statement . And that would not be , as I might Not use the word ' SAY ' everyday . Anyway , yours seems the most logical to be correct , and all these in-depth theories about this ' riddle ' makes me think these people have too much time on their hands . ( Just joking here , nothing personal ) <p> Ronski writes : just to help along the gry explanation - would n't the answer be even more simple .. as in a word that SOUNDS like " gry " ... like the word AGREE ? <p> From Stephanie - Darons right . The answer is Dictionary . " You use it everyday and you know what it is . If you have listened carefully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The OLD ENGLISH DICTIONARY was spelled DICTONAGRY . I never would have thought of that . I guess if you say the riddle wrong , you never will come up with the correct answer .

Therefore GRY stands for Green , Red , and Yellow . <p> From Mark- well , 2 possible answers , in the first version that is wrong , the answer is Three , three is the 3rd word , and that is so convenient . However , In your version you say is the original , the third word in the entire puzzle is " words " and everyone in the world uses words except for the click languages in Africa I think . <p> geoff has researched words ending in the letters g @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see his list , click here <p> Nancy writes- Maybe Dictionary.com is n't as great as they say .

The only word used 3 times in the whole thing in the original version is SAY here 's the original version .

If you send this to 5 people they WILL pop up on your screen . What is " it " ? A " word " . What is the third " word " ? Another " word " . Of course , all of the possible answers to this riddle are also more " words " . " Words " will make you so MAD ! <p> From The Riddle Nut : The answer is language .

" If you looked at my hints you will see that the third word in " the English language " is language . <p> From Robin : this only really works with this version . the answer is ' AGREE ' . As a spoken riddle this works very well . The line ' The third one everyone uses every day and knows what it stands for . ' describes the word , i.e everyone ' AGREES ' about the words meaning , and it is a common word , either in the form ' AGREE ' or any other way we show we agree with people . <p> From Onechatterbox98- The riddle is misleading a lot of you . It ca n't be GRY because it is to small . Something that small would be lost and the word has not been used for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is TWO words ! Also everyone does not use it everyday ! There is French , German , Italian , ext . So that is not the answer either . So you ask what the answer is ? It is simple . There is no such thing . Because no one uses the same thing everyday . It is meant to give you a headache . It is like the riddle of the lying man . " I man walks up to you and says everything I say is a lie . Is he telling the truth ?

That is my answer to this riddle . <p> Pchacker- the answer is onegry <p> Kelly writes- the way I received this riddle it is written like this .... There are three words in the english language that end in " gry " ONE is angry and the other is hungry . EveryONE knows what the third ONE means and what it stands for . EveryONE uses them everyday , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you the third word . what is it ? gry ? I believe that this is playing on sound and not spelling .... gry as in gree .... I also believe that the ONE is capitalized for a reason ..... The word one is used as an amount .... saying one gry or " a " gry ... hearing the riddle and seeing the riddle is what makes the difference as the riddler said .... so you use a as in " a tree " or " a lightbulb " meaning one tree or one lightbulb ..... therefore one gry would be a gry ... and using the sound gry as in angry or hungry you would deduce the word is " AGREE " ... and ... something else I forgot to mention , in the riddle it said if you LISTENED carefully again telling you that it is the sound and not the spelling ........ <p> From Josh- I just wanted to say that the answer has to be language because it 's something that is used everyday .... even if you write instead of say it , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " or " what " because there is no guarantee that you use those words everyday but you have to use language everyday so I 'm just tell all of you that the only possible answers is " language " or daron might be right and it might be " dictionary " but it ca n't be anything else because if it was " and " then why would it say that angry and hunry are TWO of them ? ? ? this is my guess .... PS : did n't the creator tell anyone the right answer ? ? ( i doubt that the riddler is the creator ) oh yea i forgot to mention that even if the riddler was right and you are meant to read it out loud then when you got to the part where it says " what is the third word ? " then you would n't read it as a question and " what " would have to be the third word and that part that he added in the riddle that says " i have already told you the word three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writes : I have figured it out completely and it all makes since all you have to do is read the riddlers solution or hint in the riddle these phrases are stated , " there are three WORDS " , what is the third WORD " ( in the riddle ) , " and i have told you the answer three times already " ( the word WORD is said three times , in think of a word , and the third word , and the word is something . so simply the answer is WORD ! ! ! ! ! <p> And from Cheese2264- STOP ! ! you 're all right . Riddles change a lot , which often changes the answer , thus making it a completely different riddle. furthermore , many , many riddles have more than one answer . all of the above answers CAN be correct , so this particular riddle has many different answers , each of which probably says quite a bit about the person who gives that particular answer . There is no one correct answer . deal with it . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know that the key phrase is " the English language " Clearly the correct answer is the third word in the riddle , words . Obviously everybody uses words . <p> From cc lam : i reckon its the word " everything " because u uses everything everyday i think lol The word is someTHING that EVERYone uses every day If you have listened carefully , I have already told you what it is .. thin-G eve-RY well it a good guess =D <p> Bullseye writes : if you look at the first answer to the riddle that you gave , you said that there were other words like bowgry , hogry , hangry , and aggry. than if you add those words to angry and hungry there are more than three words . i still agree with your first answer : language because ive seen that on a couple of other websites too . another opinion that i have is that the riddler 's answer is wrong because it would n't be g or y. r does n't even really sound like or unless your like from Texas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , yea right ! he 's probably 1,000,000 years old then . i also think the answer : gry is wrong because the riddle says -gry not gry. the - clearly states that there is more behind the gry . <p> From Mike : The answer is " NO . " All of the " GRY " riddle versions ask the same question , and the question is - " What is the third word ? " and " What " is not the third word . <p> From Avalon - THE ULTIMATE ANSWER : As the Riddler has said that " The trick to this riddle is it was designed to be read aloud . The trick is the usage of GRY vs . G or Y ( pronounced G R Y ) Now you should be able to figure out the answer . " What the riddler means is that we should not think of GRY as one word but two letters which is " G " or " Y " . so we should not look for GRY but words ending with letter " G " or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them which end with letter " Y " . Therefore the word which he has used in the riddle is of course " SAY " which he has used three times and also ends with the letter " Y " . So finally the ultimate answer is " say " and there can not be any better answer then this . I would request the Riddler to come forward and please let us know if we have found the answer by now or Not . <p> Samantha writes : The answer to the GRY Riddle ... There is absolutely no exact or correct answer to this riddle . Do n't you get it ? The answer depends on how the riddle is interpreted and there is no correct way for riddles to be interpreted . It 's like a math problem that gives you too little information , so that there are many possible answers . Everyone 's answer was correct because the information in the riddle led them to a conclusion that made sense . But , that same information along with other information could have led you to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost all of the answers ( that were backed with with facts from and not from the riddle and were understandable ) are correct . <p> From Jeffery : I 'm not much of a riddler , but have not been able to avoid the gry thing since I was the developer of both the OED Online and the Century Dictionary Online , and it keeps coming up as a search term . I was inclined to go along with the cleverness of " language " , but it seems that may depend on the wording that many people do n't accept . I recently saw your site and the discussion of S or Y and say , This intrigued me , as the many of the early forms of say end not only in y , but in g or a yogh , the middle English letter that resembles the number 3 and developed into modern forms with either y or g . I 'm not offering this as a solution , but in light of the " 3 times " hint , it might be interesting to consider @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd like to say that if I knew how much debate existed surrounding the -gry riddle I would never have accessed the site ! I would never have thought so much debate over a silly riddle could be so addictive to read ! Anyway , joking aside , I just wanted to add to the idea that the " -gry " aspect of it could mean " g or y " . If this were the case why would there would be a hyphen , " - " . This suggests it is a suffix , so does n't this indicate it the stem of a word , rather that a " g or y " type thing . I may be wrong , but thought it worth considering . <p> Lori in Ohio writes : Simplifying everything , what I hear , see , and what just makes sense to me in this riddle are two lines : WHAT is the third word If you have listened carefully , I have already told you WHAT it is .

That is just something to make you think about , but after that the second sentence say 's . There are only three words in the English language . that is the real riddle see There are only Three words IN THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE .

The following riddles are variations of the same basic problem - it 's a weighty one - but worth it . We suggest you read and try to solve the first one and continue with the others in order given as each variation is just a little more difficult - at least we thought so . And now , the first of " weighty problems " : <p> 1 . BAGS AND BEADS <p> You are given 5 bags . There are 10 beads in each of the bags . In four of the bags , the beads each weigh 10 grams . In the remaining bag , each bead weighs only 9 grams . All the bags and beads look identical . You must find out which bag has the lighter beads . The problem is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look identical . You can use a scale , but it has to be a single-tray scale , not a two-tray balance scale . Also , you may use the scale only once . How can you find out which bag has the lighter beads ? <p> Now you should be able to solve this variation , no problem : You have 10 bags of gold coins , 10 coins per bag , 10 grams coin , but one bag of coins weigh only 9 grams per coin ( because of low quality ) . How do you find out which bag contains low quality gold coins ? You may use a scale only one time . Thanks to Jason Vuong for this variation ! <p> You have 9 marbles : 8 of them weigh 1 ounce each ; 1 weighs 1.1 ounce . The 9 marbles are all uniform in size , appearance and shape . You have access to a balance scale containing 2 trays - you may use the balance 2 times . You must determine which of the 9 marbles is the heavier one using the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ COINS This one is a little more difficult because you are not told if the object is heavier or lighter . <p> You have 9 gold coins . All 9 coins look exactly the same but one coin is a fake and is either lighter or heavier than the other 8 coins . You have a scale - balance type with 2 trays - but can only load it twice . How do you find the fake gold coin ? <p> Now , if you have been able to solve the four problems above , this final weighty problem should be " no problem " for you to solve ! This one is taken from a book : More Games for the Super Intelligent by James F. Fixx . We think it is the most difficult ! <p> You have 12 identical-looking coins , one of which is counterfeit . The counterfeit coin is either heavier or lighter than the rest . The only scale you have to use is a simple balance .

If the two sides are equal , then the remaining coin is the fake . <h> If however , the two sides are not equal , then that remaining coin is a real coin and the fake is in one side or the other of the scale . The trick is that now you must unload at the same time a single coin from each side of the scales . If the scales now balance , the bad coin is one of the two which you just withdrew . If the scales remain unbalanced , the fake is still on the scales . As you remove good coins you can just add them to the good coin pile which began with the first isolated coin .

@@28870993 @2570993/ <p> Two pounds 4 ounces ( or 2-1/4 pounds or 36 ounces ) . Three-fourths of three-fourths of a pound is 9 ounces , so the fish weighed 9 ounces plus the remaining three-fourths of its weight . Or , 9 ounces is one-quarter of its weight . <p> In 5 seconds , both trains ( together ) go 600 feet , or 120 feet per second . In 15 seconds , the faster train gains 600 feet , or 40 feet per second . Add together the sum and difference of the rates obtained , and divide by 2 . This gives 80 feet per second as the speed of the faster train ( roughly 54-1/2 miles per hour ) , from which it is clear that 40 feet per second is the speed of the slower train ( roughly 27-1/3 miles per hour ) . 
@@28870995 @2570995/ <p> Stopping along the trail to rest , Judy saw that one-third of the rest of the group from the Girl Scouts was behind her and three-fourths were ahead . Not counting Judy , what was the total number in her group ? Answer : 13 <p> Version 2 and the explanation for giving the answer 13 : <p> Resting along a path , Judy noticed that she and those behind her made up 1/3 of the troop and that those ahead made up 3/4 of troop . Counting Judy , what would be the smallest number of hikers that day ? The answer is 13 . Judy looked behind her and sees 3 , plus her would be 1/3 ( 4 out of 12 ) . Ahead she sees 9 or 3/4 of 12 . The total counting Judy is 13 . That would be the smallest number as any number divisible by both 3 and 4 could answer this riddle ! This is n't the best math question , but remember it is a riddle and riddles are designed to " play on words " and misdirect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are dealing with the number in the troop plus Judy , but Judy includes herself to get the 1/3 figure . And the final question wants to include Judy in the total but she is n't in the total of the hikers ahead . Little twists and turns are what makes a math question into a math riddle . <p> Version 3 <p> Stopping along the trail to rest , Judy saw that one-third of the rest of the group from the Girl Scouts was behind and three-fourths were ahead . Not counting Judy , what was the total number in her group ? <p> Randy writes : The puzzle leaves the reader to make a lot of assumptions such as : head of her , behind those that are ahead , etc . With the following definitions it becomes logical ; Persons can not be divided into fractions . The group = 16 . " The rest of the group " ( not counting Judy ) = 15 , 1/3 of " the rest of the group " is behind ( those that are ahead ) = 5 Judy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 4. 3/4 ( of the group ) were ahead ( of those behind ) =12 Those ahead of Judy =11 Not counting Judy , 11+4 = 15 <p> And now for the REAL SOLUTION : <p> Your answer of 13 can not be correct . In the first half of the riddle ( she and those behind her ) , Judy includes herself in the total , and thus counts as part of the troop . In the second half ( those ahead ) she excludes herself from the troop total . Since the riddle includes her in the total , she is counted as part of the troop . She looks behind her , sees three people , and adds herself as the fourth . In doing this , she is including herself in the group . Four is not 1/3 of 13 . She looks ahead and sees eight , which is indeed 3/4 of the REST of the group . So here are the variables : Total hikers : X -- This number INCLUDES Judy She , and those behind : 1/3(X) -- This number also includes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -- Remember , she is n't including herself in the group here ! Here is the math : X = 1/3(X) + 3/4 ( X - 1 ) -- Total of group equals those in back plus those in front . 12X = 4X + 9 ( X - 1 ) -- Multiply both sides by 12 12X = 4X + 9X - 9 -- Factoring 12X = 13X - 9 -- Add similar variables 12X - 13X = -9 -- Subtract 13X from both sides -X = -9 -- Add similar variables X = 9 -- Multiply both sides by -1 So the answer is 9 . This answer is not just the smallest number , it is the ONLY number , as the above math proves . Does this fit ? Here is the riddle once again : Resting along a path , Judy noticed that she and those behind her made up 1/3 of the troop and that those ahead made up 3/4 of troop . Counting Judy , what would be the smallest number of hikers that day ?

We have enjoyed the " twists and turns " this riddle has taken and appreciate the input from Roger , Randy and the others who offered it . Thanks for challenging us to think ! ! <p> UPDATE ! ! UPDATE ! ! UPDATE ! ! UPDATE ! ! <p> A recent visitor to our site offers a different solution for this riddle . It follows .... what do you think ? ? ? <p> John writes : I would definitely agree with the following statement from the solution Version 2 . " This is n't the best math question , but remember it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words " and misdirect the person reading them . " Now let 's look at the original riddle without re-writing it . What does the rest of the group mean ? From Judy 's view point it would be the entire group minus herself . What does the section " and three-fourths were ahead " mean - does this mean 3/4 of the rest of the group or 3/4 of the entire group ? Let 's look at the math from the perspective that the rest of the group means the entire group minus Judy herself and the section ahead of her is a fraction of the entire group , in this case 3/4 . Let x = the total Number in the group . Then ( x-1 ) is the rest of the group . The entire troop minus Judy herself . So what is the equation ? 1/3(x-1) + 3/4(x) = xThis means that 1/3 of the rest of the troop the people behind Judy and 3/4 of the entire group are ahead of her . We now add the two sections of the group to find out the entire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equation we will multiply both sides of the equation by 12 as it is evenly divisible by both 3 and 4. 121/3(x-1) + 3/4(x) = 12x 12(x/3-1/3) + ( 3x/4 ) = 12x 12x/3-12/3+36x/4 =12x 4x-4+9x = 12x 4x+9x = 12x + 4 13x = 12x +4 13x-12x = 4 x = 4 The total Number of people in the troop that day was 4 and the answer to the riddle would be the total number in the troop minus Judy ( 4-1 ) or 3 . Not counting Judy there were 3 people in the troop . This is a smaller number than any of the other solutions given . <p> And now , another way to look at this riddle from Nick : Neither of the solutions is right because the question has been worded wrong in all versions . Correct wording : Stopping along the trail to rest , Judy noticed that she and those behind her made up one-third of the troop and that those ahead made up three-fourths of the rest of the troop . How many people in total are in the troop ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , either will do ) . Answers to this is 9 Her plus two behind is three . 3 is one third of nine . Important to notice the words " the troop , " which includes Judy . Six others ahead 6 is three-fourths of 8 . Important to notice the words " rest of troop , " which excludes Judy . The other versions do n't work because they refer to either both times the entire troop , or both times the rest of the troop , and not one of each . So the answer would be 4 , in the troop , if the wording was the other way around , e.g. one-third of rest of troop and three-fourths the entire troop . So both randy and John had the right answer if the riddle was reworded correctly either way . <p> UPDATE AGAIN ! ! ! <p> This riddle keeps getting more answers and here are two of the most recent : From Mike - Answer : 0 Reasoning : Riddles are a play on words , and if you take the literal meaning of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ member of the Girl Scout Troop or that they were part of her group . If you take , " Not counting Judy " , from her total group number of 1 ( herself because no one else is explicitly mentioned as part of her group ) then you have 0 . Version 3 has the same answer , but why reword the riddle to get a satisfactory answer . Just answer the original and stick to it . From Sau Fan Lee- There are numerous ( and different ) solutions to your puzzle , but most of them are either incomplete or wrong . In this email , I 'm going to analyze this puzzle logically and in GREAT details .. Let 's start with Version 1 . I 'll also add in the some more information in brackets for the ambiguous parts of the puzzle : - Stopping along the trail to rest , Judy saw that one-third of the rest of the group ( i.e .. not counting herself ) from the Girl Scouts was behind her and three-fourths ( of what ? ) were ahead ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the total number in her group ? The first inserted brackets above just clarify that " the REST of the group " means Judy is not counted in the number . The second inserted brackets shows the first ambiguity . Is it referring to " 3/4 of the entire group ( including Judy ) " or " 3/4 of the rest of the group ( excluding Judy ) " ? Let 's call this ambiguity : A. The third inserted brackets shows the second ambiguity . Is it referring to " ahead of Judy " or " ahead of those behind Judy " ? Let 's call this ambiguity : B. Now , the 4 possible solutions : - <p> 1 ) Assume : A = the entire group ( includes Judy ) B = ahead of Judy x = the number of people in the ENTIRE group ( includes Judy ) Then : Troops behind Judy = ( x-1 ) /3 Troops in front of Judy = ( x-1 ) * 2/3 ( remember : Judy is not counted ) 3/4 of ENTIRE group were ahead of Judy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ x * 3/4 ( 2x-2 ) /3 = 3x/4 8x-8 = 9x ( multiply both sides by 12 ) x = -8 As the number of people can not be negative , we know this answer is impossible . So the initial assumption is wrong . 2 ) Assume : A = the entire group ( includes Judy ) B = ahead of those behind Judy x = the number of people in the ENTIRE group ( includes Judy ) Then : Troops behind Judy = ( x-1 ) /3 3/4 of ENTIRE group were ahead of those behind Judy ==&gt; x * 3/4 Those that are behind Judy = x * 1/4 = x/4 ( x-1 ) /3 = x/4 4x-4 = 3x ( multiply both sides by 12 ) x = 4 So , the total number of troops EXCLUDING Judy is 4-1 = 3 . There is 1person behind Judy and 2 in front . So looking at the question , 1/3 of the rest of the troop ( 1 person ) is behind Judy , and 3/4 of the entire troop ( 3/4 * 4 = @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind Judy . 3 ) Assume : A = the rest of the group ( excludes Judy ) B = ahead of Judy x = the number of people in the ENTIRE group ( includes Judy ) Then : Troops behind Judy = ( x-1 ) /3 Troops in front of Judy = ( x-1 ) * 2/3 ( remember : Judy is not counted ) 3/4 of entire group MINUS Judy were ahead of Judy ==&gt; ( x-1 ) *3/4 ( x-1 ) * 2/3 = ( x-1 ) * 3/4 8x-8 = 9x-9 ( multiply both sides by 12 ) x = 1 So , the entire troop comprises of only Judy . There is no one behind of her or in front of her . So the total number of troops EXCLUDING Judy is 1-1= 0 . This answer , although correct , is unlikely to be actual answer of the puzzle . 4 ) Assume : A = the rest of the group ( excludes Judy ) B = ahead of those behind Judy x = the number of people in the ENTIRE group ( includes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) /33/4 of entire group MINUS Judy were ahead of those behind Judy==&gt; ( x-1 ) * 3/4 Those that are behind Judy = ( x-1 ) * 1/4 = ( x-1 ) /4 ( x-1 ) /3 = ( x-1 ) /4 4x-4 = 3x-3 ( multiply both sides by 12 ) x = 1 So , the entire troop comprises of only Judy . There is no one behind of her or in front of her . So the total number of troops EXCLUDING Judy is 1-1= 0 . This answer , although correct , is unlikely to be actual answer of the puzzle . Therefore , the most likely answer for the version 1 of the puzzle is 3 , as discussed in Assumption 2 above . <p> Now let 's look at Version 2 of the puzzle . Again , I 'll insert additional information in brackets for the parts that are ambiguous . Resting along a path , Judy noticed that she and those behind her made up1/3of the troop ( counting Judy ? ) and that those ahead ( of whom ? ) made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what would be the smallest number of hikers that day ? The first inserted brackets above shows the first ambiguity . Does the " troop " include Judy or not ? We will refer to this ambiguity as A. - The second inserted brackets shows the second ambiguity . Is it referring to ahead of Judy " or " ahead of those behind Judy " ? This will be ambiguity B. - The third inserted brackets shows the same ambiguity as the first one . Due to the way the question is worded , the " troop " here should be the same as the one in A. So whatever is assumed for A is assumed for this " troop " here . Now , the 4 possible solutions : - 1 ) Assume : A = troop includes Judy B = ahead of Judy x = the number of people in the ENTIRE group ( includes Judy ) Then : 1/3 of the troop including Judy ==&gt; x/3 So , Judy and those behind her = x/3 Thus , those ahead of Judy = x * 2/3 3/4 of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those ahead of Judy = x * 3/4 x * 2/3 = x * 3/4 8x = 9x ( multiply both sides by 12 ) x = 0 This answer is impossible as the entire group must consist of at least1person ( Judy ) . So the initial assumption is wrong . 2 ) Assume : A = troop includes Judy B = ahead of those behind Judy x = the number of people in the ENTIRE group ( includes Judy ) Then : 1/3 of the troop including Judy ==&gt; x/3 So , Judy and those behind her = x/3 Thus , those behind Judy = x/3 - 1 3/4 of the troop including Judy ==&gt; x * 3/4 So , those ahead of those behind Judy = x * 3/4 Thus , those behind Judy = x * 1/4 = x/4 x/3 - 1 = x/4 4x-12 = 3x ( multiply both sides by 12 ) x = 12 So , the total number of troops INCLUDING Judy is 12 . There are 3people behind Judy and 8 in front . So looking at the question , 1/3 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and 3/4 of the ENTIRE troop ( 3/4 * 12 = 9 people , including Judy ) are ahead of those behind Judy . 3 ) Assume : A = troop NOT includes Judy B = ahead of Judy x = the number of people in the ENTIRE group ( includes Judy ) Then : 1/3 of the troop excluding Judy ==&gt; ( x-1 ) /3 So , Judy and those behind her = ( x-1 ) /3 Thus , those behind Judy = ( x-1 ) /3 - 1 3/4 of the troop excluding Judy ==&gt; ( x-1 ) * 3/4 So , those ahead of Judy = ( x-1 ) * 3/4 Thus , those behind Judy = ( x-1 ) * 1/4 = ( x-1 ) /4 ( Remember : Judy is not included in the troop ) ( x-1 ) /3 - 1 = ( x-1 ) /4 4x-16 = 3x-3 ( multiply both sides by 12 ) x = 13 So , the total number of troops INCLUDING Judy is 13 . There are 3people behind Judy and 9 in front . So looking at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 13-1 ) /3 = 4 people ( including Judy , since we explicitly added her to get 1/3 ) , and 3/4 of the troop MINUS Judy ( ( 13-1 ) * 3/4 = 9 people ) are ahead of Judy . 4 ) Assume : A = troop NOT includes Judy B = ahead of those behind Judy x = the number of people in the ENTIRE group ( includes Judy ) Then : 1/3 of the troop excluding Judy ==&gt; ( x-1 ) /3 So , Judy and those behind her = ( x-1 ) /3 Thus , those behind Judy = ( x-1 ) /3 - 1 3/4 of the troop excluding Judy ==&gt; ( x-1 ) * 3/4 So , those ahead of those behind Judy = ( x-1 ) * 3/4 Thus , those behind Judy = ( x-1 ) * 1/4 = ( x-1 ) /4 ( x-1 ) /3 - 1 = ( x-1 ) /4 4x-16 = 3x-3 ( multiply both sides by 12 ) x = 13 So , the total number of troops INCLUDING Judy is 13 . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking at the question , 1/3 of the troop MINUS Judy is ( 13-1 ) /3 = 4 people ( including Judy , since we explicitly added her to get 1/3 ) , and 3/4 of the troop MINUS Judy ( ( 13-1 ) * 3/4 = 9 people ) are ahead of Judy . Therefore , the most likely answer for the version 2 of the puzzle iseither12 or 13 , based on the assumptions made , as discussed above . <p> Finally , let 's look at Version 3 of the puzzle . Again , I 'll insert additional information in brackets for the parts that are ambiguous . Stopping along the trail to rest , Judy saw that one-third of the rest of the group ( i.e .. not counting herself ) from the Girl Scouts was behind ( whom ? ) and three-fourths ( of what ? ) were ahead ( of whom ? ) . Not counting Judy , what was the total number in her group ? The first inserted brackets above just clarify that " the REST of the group " means Judy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brackets shows the first ambiguity . Is it referring to " behind Judy " or " behind those ahead of Judy " ? This is ambiguity : A. - The third inserted brackets shows the second ambiguity . Is it referringto " 3/4 of the entire group ( including Judy ) " or " 3/4 of the rest of the group ( excluding Judy ) " ? This is ambiguity : B. - The fourth inserted brackets shows the third ambiguity . Is it referring to " ahead of Judy " or " ahead of those behind Judy " ? This is ambiguity : C. Essentially , this version is the same as Version 1 except that the word " her " is removed to make a new ambiguity . I 'm not going to bother doing another full analysis here ( and there are 8 of them ! ) , and I 'm sure you know how to do them . I have n't analyze this version completely myself , but as this is a reader 's own version of the puzzle , I 'm going to leave it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the original version of the puzzle , 13 , 15 or 9 is not a correct answer , but 4 is . In the second version , both 12 and 13 are correct , but note that the 2 versions are very different and yield completely different answers . So one can not substitute the first version with the second . So , what does all these come down to ? The " problem " of this puzzle is that it is not well-defined . I agree that a puzzle can allow for playing on words , but make sure it can only be played one way , and not multiple ways . Otherwise , there will be a lot of possible answers , and each of them is as accurate as the other , like this puzzle here . Phew ! <p> Phew indeed ! !

So if you say that it 's the whole mountain that counts , then Mauna Keaisthe tallest . Thanks to Lawrence and friend for this info ! AND from Ashton - I think it should be noted , that our friend who left the note about Mauna Kea should know that Mountains are measured in distance from sea level , and his height given for Mt . Everest is wrong , he is seven feet short , it has since grown ( remeasured in 2000 ) AND from Michael - I have discovered two errors in your answers and notes . For one , Mount Everest is only the tallest mountain above sea level . You also mention that Mauna Kea is the tallest mountain from the bottom of the sea , making it the tallest mountain from the base to the peak . But you fail to mention Mount Chimborazo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tallest mountain from the center of the earth . Since Mount Chimborazo is on the equator , it is boosted much higher from the core . In terms of from sea level , Mount Everest is 8,848 meters and Mount Chimborazo is only 6,267 meters . But in terms of from the core of the earth , Mount Chimborazo is 6,384,404 meters and Mount Everest is only 6,381,670 . This makes the peak of Mount Chimborazo 2,734 meters higher than the peak of Mount Everest . I believe that this should at least be mentioned in the answer or as a note . <h> 6. 6 , he makes 5 originals from the 25 butts he found , and after he smokes them he has 5 butts left for another cigar . <h> 7 . The Sequoia . She only likes words with all 5 vowels in them . The Sequoia is the only American tree that contains all 5 vowels . Michael also notes:Also , the Sequoia is not the only North American tree with all five vowels . The Southern Magnolia , Quaking Aspen , Russian-Olive ( which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might ) all have all five vowels too and are North American . I admit that the Southern Magnolia and Quaking Aspen are two words , and the Russian-Olive has a hyphen , but I see no reason for not including the Euphorbia . I hope that you at least mention these in the answers for the logic riddles . <h> 8 . One , he may have many Birthdays , but only one birth day ! <h> 9 . Mother , or Mom , or whatever you call your maternal relative . <h> 10 . The answer is actually feathers . We need proof though ! AND SO : From Joni- One pound of feathers is more than one pound of gold because the " pound " unit is different . The most commonly used system of weights in the US andGreat Britain is the avoirdupois system , where 1 pound = 16 ounces . Thisisused for most solid objects , except for precious metals and gems ; gold isweighed by a special system , called the troy system , where one troy pound=12 troy ounces . Where one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grams.To convert from avoirdupois pounds to troy pounds , multiply the first by1.2152 to get its equivalent in troy measurement . Therefore , one " pound " offeathers in troy weight is actually 1.2152 pounds ( one avoirdupois pound ) , compared to one troy pound of gold . And the feathers win . Thanks Joni ! ! <p> 11 .

It only takes 9 cuts to get 10 equal sections . <p> *NOTE : Several visitors take issue with this answer so here are alternate answers : ( Maybe yours , too ) ! <p> Gonzo and jimminie write : u can make 10 equal pieces of wood from the plank <p> in just 5 cuts .

Since we do n't know HOW WIDE the plank is , that alternative suggestion wo n't tell us how many MINUTES it takes to cut lengthwise so it 's not a valid suggestion .

He uses the reasoning that since both have mass , andthat since mass ca n't exist in the same place at the same time , when theymeet , the plane from Paris has to still be closer to paris . NOTE : Rob writes the following- <p> I would like to make a rebuttal to that , in supporting your answer . <p> From geometry , if you have a line segment that is the perpendicularbisector of another line segment , then the points on the bisector areequidistant from the endpoints of the other segment . The sense of meetis not that they occupy the same space , but rather than they lie in aline together in which that line is parallel , spherically to the line oflongitude that paris is on . <p> Disclaimer : We present our site as a collection of riddles , game , puzzles , etc .

Latin translation for sea is mare . March starts with it , December has it near the end . Peace and war neither have it . Many has it , few does not . Latin translation for shadows is umbra. 2004 is MMIV . <p> And for another way to look at this , Bryan writes - I believe the answer to riddle 3 is " Mirror " . The biggest clue comes from the line " You find me neither in peace nor war " . The words " peace " and " war " are political opposites ; an era is either a time of peace or a time of war , and they are mutually exclusive . Thus for something to be in neither peace nor war means it is not in anything at all , which is nonsensical . It makes more sense to look at the actual words " war " and " peace " , implying that the author is hiding clues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can go line by line : " I am in the sea BUT not in the water " - you can see your reflection on the surface of the ocean but it is not actually in the water . " I start in March and end in December " - here the author plays with the words " March " and " December " ; the beginning letter in March is " M " and the ending letter in December is " r " , the beginning and ending letters in " Mirror " . " You find me neither in peace nor war " - again wordplay . " Mirror " can not b e spelled using letters from " peace " or " war " , and there is absolutely no symmetry in the structure of these words .

We protect you all the time . Yet you treat us badly . You burn us in public buildings to make you seem better . You try to make us straight but most of us refuse usually . When we are dead , you are pleased . Yet , when we are gone , you are sad . What are we ? <p> ANSWER : We received two answers in equal proportions for this one : trees and hair <p> A man has to take two pills each day , at the exact same time or he will die . If he only takes one or he takes two of the same pill he will die . Both medications look the same and are the same weight . One day he drops both open pill bottles scattering the pills across the floor . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he take his pills so he wo n't die ? <p> ANSWER : First the man must take a scale and find the exact weight of two of the pills . Since the pills on the ground are randomly mixed , there is no possible way to seperate them again . The solution is to go one step further in their mixing . Since the medications were of identical weight , and the man was taking one pill from each medication every day , half of the mixed pills will be from each medication . The man should take the two pills remaining in the bottle and place them in the pile , then grind all of the mixed pills into a powder . The powder should be mixed so that both medications are equally distributed throughout the powder ( in the manner a pharmacologist measures out pills ; the actual medication only amounts to a small percentage of the actual pill ) . With enough mixing , a sample of this powder will contain 50% of one medication and 50% of the other , a result from Probability . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or simply ingest the powder , as long as the amount of the mixture he takes each day is equal in weight to the weight of two of the old pills . Ideally , he would now take one pill each day which is twice as large as either of the former pills . This way , he receives the same amount of each medication he would have as if he were to take two of the old pills . -Thanks to Bryan for this great explanation ! <p> What do the following words have in common ? screen , inflammable , dust , left <p> ANSWER : These words are " self antonyms " ; each word has two meanings that are opposite of each other .

We have received many very good solutions/suggestions . Here is the simple one : From Stephanie -The answer is not a math principle , but the principle of math hard at work . Why is 2 + 2 and 2 x 2 the same answer ? You can spend hours looking for a complicated solution but , quite simply this is just how math works . <p> Somehow that answer disappoints me and many math fans , and there is some basic math going on in the riddle . Eric reports this : It is called the additive inverse property of multiplication . I asked my Calculus teacher who has a doctorate degree in Mathematics . <p> ........ Now , that sounds more like it ! <p> And Dipanwita helps it along offering this - This is the solution to the 4 prices riddle . It is NOT just these 4 prices .... the answer is : Take ANY 3 numbers and divide their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such that all 4 will add to and multiply to the same . So , e.g. , take 3.5 , 5.95 , 2.15 . Their sum is 11.6 . SO the fourth number is 11.6/ ( 3.5 x 5.95 x 2.15 ) -1 = 0.265 . <p> ....... Now we are getting to the nuts and bolts of this riddle . It seems like a coincidence , but it really is not . <p> And Corey responds with - The numbers are not just a coincidence ... They are quite easily derived as follows : <p> Say you have a group of N-1 numbers . Simply take the current sum and divide by ( the current product minus 1 ) to get the remaining number . <p> I see this as the fundamental principal relationship between the numbers of the $7.11 problem . The " integer number of cents " requirement then just reduces the possible combination of numbers . <p> ........ Still with me on this one ? ? ? ? <p> Michael solves it this way : We know two facts in this riddle : all four numbers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Our object should be to find an equation for all values for which this statement is true , and then the mathematical concept will become evident . So let 's assign a variable to each of the four values given : x - 1.20 y - 1.25 z - 1.50 w - 3.16 <p> These two equations will tell us every value for x , y , z , and w for which the riddle is true . Unfortunately , those two graphs have four variables , meaning the resulting graph is in four dimensions . We can only graph this in our heads , and certainly ca n't find any values for x , y , z , and w . But we do have two equations relating x , y , z , and w to a constant , 7.11 , so we can solve for a variable in one equation and plug it into another . I will solve for w : w + x + y + z = 7.11 w = 7.11 - x - y - z <p> Now we plug that value of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - y - z ) ( x ) ( y ) ( z ) = 7.11 <p> Now we only have 3 variables , and this three dimensional graph will tell us all possible values for which the riddle is true . We can graph this equation on a TI-89 calculator , but the equation has to be expressed in terms of z first . This requires some pretty messy algebra . We 'll start by dividing both sides by ( x ) ( y ) : ( 7.11 - x - y - z ) ( z ) = 7.11/ ( x ) ( y ) <p> We now have everything we need to use the quadratic formula ( z= ( -b+or-(b2-4ac)1/2 ) /2a ) A = 1 ( the coefficient in front of the 1st term ) , B = x + y - 7.11 ( the coefficient in front of the second term ) , C = 7.11/xy <p> Using the quadratic formula , we get that z = ( -x-y+7.11 +or- ( ( x+y-7.11 ) 2-28.44/xy ) 1/2 ) /2 , or two planes . Every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the three values for x , y , and z in the riddle are on the plane . Plug them back in to either of the original equations to find w . The mathematical concept used in this problem is graphing in the third dimension , or more generally , multi-variable calculus . <p> .... But wait ! Jason writes- This is just a simple algebra equation . You can make up any numbers that you want and still come up with the same effect if you balance the equation . Below is the equation being used : a+b+c+d = a*b*c*d So if you want to create your own problem with the same effect do the following : 1 . Write down any numbers that you want and as many number that you want . 2 . Add them all up on one side and multiply them all on the other side ( of the equation ) . 3 .

I am not sure about this one but it reminds me of something i learned about wood . In my cradle is where i would put my wood to cure for 13 days then split it into three pieces to the center heart of the wood only to be thankful that i had it on a cold day to warm me through to my heart . <p> .... and Lavette also noted - i have already submitted my solution as wood but after further research i feel i need to update it . I still believe it is wood . In my cradle is where it would lay , not for 13 days but 1 year to season not cure , being 13 days of full moons each year , hence fruitful moon completing it 's full cycle . when wood is seasoned for that long it automatically splits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ properly split it will fall into 3 pieces . referred to as sons , not in the feminine because the fruit of the tree represents the female and the trunk or wood is the male hence sons . to vie for pieces of my heart can refer to the heart of a fire or in Indian terms the fire is in the heart of the dwelling , also a fire it 's self is started with kindling and the finest choice of wood to create the heart of the fire . i believe if you look into this you will find it is correct information on fire wood , generally hard woods . i can see where some would answer the fertile crescent but this is far more specific . hope you choose to publish ... if you respond who is author ? sounds like a Quatrain from Nostradamus lol. but definite astronomical term to identify 13 cycles of moon each year being 13 days in total . every line fits . <p> ... and Lavette adds - after considering fertile crescent i realized it is only part of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always refered to a full moon as a fruitful moon , have n't heard this any in modern usage . The answer is Jerusalem , it lies within the cradle of the fertile crescent and her 3 sons are Judaism , Islam and Christianity which have grown apart all claim their roots to be in Jerusalem yet in one year or 13 lunar cycles or since Islam came into being 1300 yrs . ago approximately ( a thousand years is as a day ) now are they grown apart yet all three vie for a piece of her heart or her old city as it is known or the temple mount it 's self . again sounds like Nostradamus prophecy lol . <p> And thus , riddle solvers , this one is solved ! <p> Although broken , they will always exist and surround us .

But the simple answer is - only 2 pieces and 1 cut *because* after you make that 1 cut , you no longer have the " check " you started with !

( she can not turn around and look behind her and they can not speak ) <p> ANSWER : The text of the riddle is corrupted . First , the last of the persons in line ( who sees the other two ) says : I do n't know what is the color of my hat . Then the second says : I do n't know what is the color of my hat . <p> The first in line reasons as follows : If both me and the one in the middle had red hats on , then the third person would know that he has to wear blue , since there are only two red hats . So me and the second guy do n't wear two red hats . So we either wear two blue , or a red and the blue . <p> Now the second guy can figure as much as I did , so if I was wearing a red hat he would know that he has to wear blue .

It 's a great riddle and using a little logic , you should be able to solve this one - <p> Once upon a time there was a ruler in Persia who had a very beautiful daughter . When it was time for her to be married , the marriage was arranged by her father as was the custom in that part of the world . Many young men came to be interviewed by the ruler , but no one person was perfect for the princess . After several months , the ruler finally decided that three princes from nearby kingdoms were suitable for the princess . Since each one was equal to the other in wealth , personality , manners , looks and intelligence , the princess 's father had to devise a way to differentiate between them and declare one as the man who would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them to his palace and brought them to a room , elegantly furnished and with a single round table about 2 meters in diameter . There were three chairs around the table , equally spaced from each other . He bade them each take a seat . By this time , the three princes were puzzled by the secretive behavior of the ruler , ( and I do n't mind telling you ) , a little apprehensive . But the ruler smiled and proceeded to explain to them that he considered each of them to be equally qualified to marry his daughter , so he had created a game to determine which one would win the hand of his daughter . <p> He produced three elegant scarves , woven of the finest silk and blindfolded each prince with them . Then he proceeded to explain that he had in his hand a contained of lampblack . This was a very common ingredient of the day , as it was used to make a sort of ink . But in its dry form , it could be used to make a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with his forefinger , made a mark of " X " on each mans forehead . As he explained to them , he MAY or MAY NOT have lampblack on his finger as he made each mark . Thus , each man could have a black " X " on his forehead or could have no visible mark at all . But he told them also that one or more of them had a black mark . <p> Now , said the ruler , take off your blindfolds . As each man did and became accustomed to the light , the ruler said , " The first man who can correctly tell me whether he has a black mark or not will be the man who will marry my daughter , the princess . You may not touch yourself or each other or move from your chairs . " <p> Seeing that neither he nor the other two had an immediate response , after a short time , one of the men stood up and correctly stated how his forehead was marked , and , was declared the winner . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black " Xs " . <p> How did the winner determine he was marked with a black " X " rather than no " X " ? <p> ANSWER : ( corrected thanks to Chad ! ) The reason he deduced he had one was because basically he was the first to realize this ; Let 's call him A and the losers B and C. IF B and C did n't have x 's , then A would know right away because at least one person has one . IF B had one and C did n't then A would also know that He has one because B would have come to the same conclusion ( i.e. A and C do n't have one so I must ) Knowing these two facts and knowing that both B and C would have figured these two fact out as well , since there was no response , then A naturally deduces that He Must have an X as well . Had nothing ... absolutely nothing with them trying to trick him . <p> Jimmy 's math teacher asked him to multiply three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? <p> ANSWER : 12 , three times <p> From Matt - This must be one of the hardest math riddles there is. which means " i do n't have a clue " <p> here is how it goes . <p> there is a row a soldiers that is 1km in length . and they walk with a constant speed in a straight line , in 1 direction . <p> all the way at the end walks a messenger . he has to bring a message to the captain walking all the way at the beginning of the row <p> the messenger starts walking past the soldiers and immediately turns around when arriving at the captain and walks back to the end of the row . when the messenger is back at end . the hole group of soldiers traveled a distance of 1000 meters . <p> the soldiers and captain are walking at the same constant speed . and the messenger ( walking faster then the soldiers ) is also walking a a constant speed . <p> you do n't know anything about time or speed . <p> question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the end of the row to the beginning and back . <p> please do n't try to do this by head . you 'll probably need a calculator and a few sheets off paper . <p> ANSWER : Here is the simple answer - The answer to #7 is really very simple . The messenger has to have traveled 2 km . It does n't matter what speed they walked at . At the beginning af the puzzle , the line is 1 km long . The general is therefore 1km ahead of him . He must therefore travel more than 1 km to reach the general . Since the line moves 1000 m , or 1 km forward , the end is where the beginning was . Even if he walked 1.5 km to the general , he only has to walk .5 km to get back to the end of the line . It goes faster going back , because now they are coming towards him , and not going away . <p> AND NOW FOR THE MORE CALCULATED ANSWER : <p> Let 's denote the speed of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ messenger by V. Let t1 denote the time it takes the messenger to reach captain and t2 the time it takes him to get back to the end of the line . <p> The troop has travelled 1000m in time ( t1+t2 ) , so : <p> 1000m = W ( t1+t2 ) <p> t1+t2 = 1000m/W <p> At the same time both in time t1 and t2 the messenger travels 1000m relative to the column , so : <p> t1 = 1000m/ ( V-W ) <p> t2 = 1000m/ ( V+W ) <p> This gives equation : <p> 1000m/W = 1000m/ ( V-W ) + 1000m/ ( V+W ) <p> When you divide the numerators by 1000m , the denominators by W , and denote V/W by A you obtain : <p> 1 = 1/ ( A-1 ) + 1/ ( A+1 ) <p> A2 - 1 = 2A <p> Solving that quadratic formula for A you obtain 1+sqrt(2) and 1-sqrt(2) . Since V/W ca n't be negative it turns out V/W = 1+sqrt(2) . <p> Filip has offered this solution - I think that the easier solution is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ppl are walking forward , so then in order to get to the captain and back he must have walked diagonally towards the captain , and halfway ( 500m ) he reached the captain , and then walked diagonally back which is another 500km. so basically he made 2 triangles . Imagine the row of soldiers at the beginning as one side of the triangle and the 500m they travelled ( halfway ) at the bottom the other side , so basically you have this now : now the line missing is the distance travelled by the messenger halfway through the walk . so let 's call the line of soldiers ( on the left ) A and the bottom line , ( line of distance 500m ) B , and the distance travelled by the messenger which connects the end of line A and the end of line B , line C. so now you got line A ( line of soldiers ) Line B ( distance travelled by soldiers 500m ) and line C ( distance travelled by messenger to get to the captain . to find out line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ multiplied by B squared ( 1000m x 1000m ) x ( 500m x 500m ) for simpler i 'll just turn it into km ( 1km x 1km ) + ( .5km x .5km ) 1km + .25km = 1.25km so u found out C squared , but now to find out a side from C u find out the root from 1.25 which is 1.118033989 so that 's how many km the messenger travelled to get to the captain , and to find out how much he travelled to get to the captain and back u multiply that by 2 1.118033989 x 2 = 2.236067977 <p> When you think about , its actually simpler and quicker : D i think this is the answer PLEASE ! ! ! ! I spent so much time on this , so please dun just ignore this , think about it , and add it to the possible answers : ) I 'm 14 from Canada , Toronto and came across this while looking for riddles : ) <p> Something that runs but never stops , it never gets tired nor walk .

Clues-it has no legs and the answer is two words <p> ANSWER : black hole or your shadow <p> Name five days of the week without saying - Monday , Tuesday , Wednesday , Thursday , Friday . <p> ANSWER : Got lots of suggestions for this one , but the simplest and the most obvious is the correct answer : day before yesterday ; yesterday ; today ; tomorrow ; and the day after tomorrow . <p> Bill said he can hang his hat , walk 100 feet , and shoot a hole right through the hat with a gun while blindfolded. how does he do it ? <p> ANSWER : He hangs his hat on his gun and shoots through it . <p> i am third , i can sense , and i am home of many . we are n't the same but we sound like we are . what are the three of us ? . i am third , i can sense , and i am home of many . we are n't the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the three of us ? <p> ANSWER : The letter C , the word SEE and the word SEA . <p> Eight men wanted separate rooms in a hotel but there were only 7 rooms available . The clerk said he could handle it and proceeded to assign the men to the rooms . How does he do it ? <p> ANSWER : This riddle has been on the unsolved page for a very long time and we have received many , many different answers for it . The most common solutions involved things like - assuming that two of the men were conjoined twins and would only need one room ; the clerk shooting one of the men ; naming the clerk as one of the 8 men ; giving the seven rooms at his hotel and sending the 8th man to the hotel across the street ; making the lobby into a room for one of the men ; calling the bathroom a " separate room " ; knowing that someone would be checking out while the clerk is checking in 7 of the men ; <p> So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those that stretches your thinking . For those of you who did a little thinking on this one , you will be disappointed at the answer - I know I was . I was expecting something along the lines of above - something like a " lateral thinking " riddle . However , it turns out that this riddle is a clever misdirection of words and really does n't have a logical solution , it 's answer just makes you think it is solved ( if that 's possible ! ) I know there will be many who do n't agree with this solution , but I do believe it is the solution intended and here it is : <p> The man says that he 'd like two of the men to wait in the 1st room . Then he assigns the 3rd man in the second room ; the 4th man in the third room ; the 5th man in the fourth room ; the 6th man in fifth room ; the 7th man in the sixth room . He now goes and gets one of the two he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man in the 7th room . Job done ! ! ...... or is it ? ? <p> Like I said , do n't think about this one for too long - if you do you 'll see the obvious error in thinking , ( and the ignoring of the real 8th man ) but at first you might agree , the clerk put 8 men in 7 rooms ! <p> Lots of fun thinking about this one and thanks everyone for helping ! Also , you might enjoy looking at this site for more info on this riddle : <p> A man was boarding the last flight to Las Vegas . As he came in , he tapped on the cockpit door and greeted the pilot , whom he knew as a friend . He then took his seat . Moments later , a SWAT unit burst into the cabin and hauled out the confused man for questioning . What was the name of the pilot ? <p> ANSWER : The pilot 's name is " Jack " and when the man greeted the pilot with " Hi Jack " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the SWAT was called and the story played out as described ! <p> What is the only plant that produces fruit , that a camper can carry into the woods full , but after the camper is too weak to carry it out empty ? " <p> ANSWER : A gas tank . In the riddle , the word " camper " means " mobile camping vehicle " instead of " person who camps " . The word " fruit " is a metaphor for the exhaust that a gas tank produces . A camping vehicle can be driven into the woods as long as its tank is full , but once the tank 's empty , it is now " too weak " to move anymore . <p> WHAT IS TALLER SITTING THAN STANDING ? <p> ANSWER : A dog or a cat . <p> How is the letter G like 12:00 ? <p> ANSWER : For this answer to work , you must know that 12:00 is referring to 12:00 Midnight ---- that said , you probably now easily see that G is in the middle of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it .

What am I ? <p> ANSWER : Riddles ! <p> When the day after tomorrow will be yesterday , today will be as far from Sunday as today was from Sunday when the day before yesterday is tomorrow . What day is it today ? <p> Here 's a hint sent in by one of our visitors : This is a most confusing group of words . One visitor suggests that we interpret what the phrases mean - " day after tomorrow " really means " two days from now " . ... And " day before yesterday " really means " two days ago " .... Now , substitute : " two days from now " will be as far from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days ago . Does this help ? This visitor then followed by stating that today is Sunday . ANother hint - maybe it does n't matter what day - it could be any day of the week - all the words are there to confuse us ! ! ... and they do ! <p> ANSWER : It seems that the majority of visitors have reasoned that this riddle is filled with unnecessary information ( TMI ) and that the riddle is really quite simple and some have even commented " stupid " . Maybe clever because the answer to the question : " What day is it today ? " is whatever day it is that you happened to be reading this riddle . Yes , that is the answer - do n't believe me ? ? ? ? Write the days of the week on a piece of paper and work through the riddle . <p> And from another visitor : " My friend owns a huge multinational company , it strangely transports insects , he also loves word play , I guess that 's why he named the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ANSWER : Import-ant <p> My first is in endurance but not in health <p> My second is in richer but never in wealth <p> my third is in beggarwood but not in oak <p> my fourth is in neighbour but not in folk <p> my fifth is like a ring , going where it came <p> and my sixth is the second , exactly the same . <p> ANSWER : ( Finally ! ) From Scotty- I think that it might be the number 758905 . The answer has to do with the number of *different* letters in each word ( meaning , if the same letter appears twice , only count it once ) . ' Endurance ' has 7 , but ' health ' does n't have that same number . ' Richer ' has 5 , but ' wealth ' does n't . ' Beggarwood ' has 8 , but ' oak ' does n't . ' Neighbour ' has 9 , but ' folk ' does not . The digit 0 is kind of like a ring .

Even before the authorities open the door , they are certain the man did not take his own life . <p> The question to answer : What was the man 's cause of death , and why would n't he have died in 1989 ? <p> ANSWER : The man froze to death in 1994 ; had it been 1989 , he might not have froze because he lived in a warmer climate . OR : The man was electrocuted and had it been 1989 , well , his sentence had not been determined yet . <p> This riddle is one of those lateral thinking riddles where just about any scenario that ends with the man being found dead in 1994 would solve it . Makes you think .... <p> From one of our visitors : " Everything I say is a lie . ( Am I lying ? ) <p> ANSWER : This is a paradox and there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answer the question , but it wo n't answer the question - thus a paradox ! <p> Scotty offers this way to solve this one and it is a great answer---- The person would have to be lying . Here 's why . There are three possible patterns people could have about telling the truth . They could : ( 1 ) always tell the truth , ( 2 ) always lie , or ( 3 ) sometimes tell the truth and sometimes lie . If someone always told the truth , they would not say this , because if they did , in fact , always tell the truth , you could believe everything they said , but you could not believe this statement , since it 's not true about them . Therefore , an always-truth-teller would not say this . It 's also not possible that an always-liar would say this . Everything that an always-liar says is a lie , and since this statement would , in fact , be true about them , it would be impossible for them to say it . Now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Since they tell both truths and lies , it would be possible , whether it 's true or not , for them to say it . But it has to be a lie , since they said they only tell lies , when in fact they tell both truths and lies . Therefore , the person is lying . <p> ANSWER : the birds are candles on a birthday cake and it is their birthday so the older boy gets six candles cause he is 6 and the 4 year old gets 4 cause he 's 4 ! ! <p> I blind you , I give you food , I give you light , I give you death , I give you life , I am always there , I am never there .

Victoria explains- People always lie about their age , saying they 're younger than they really are , so people buy less candles . If they told the truth about their age , he 'd sell more candles . <p> A man weighing 190lbs. carrying three bowling balls weighing 5 lbs . each approaches a large ravine . The only way to cross the ravine is a bridge with a weight limit of 200 lbs . The ravine is too far to throw , roll , or float the balls across . How can the man cross the ravine in one trip , with all three bowling balls ? <p> ANSWER : When you read the riddle as it is written : " .. man weighing 190 lbs . carrying three bowling balls weighing 5 lbs . each ... " - this could imply that the man actually weighs 175 lbs . and with the bowling balls , weighs 190 . See how very important our grammar lessons are ? ? ? ! ! ! As such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But then , why have the riddle ? So , here is another answer , ignoring grammar : the man juggles the bowling balls - admittedly a challenging task - and therefore wo n't ever be over the weight limit . <p> When there is fire in me then I am still cold . When I own your true love 's face then you will not see me . To all things I give no more than I am given . In time I may have all things , and yet I can keep nothing . What am I ? <p> ANSWER : A mirror <p> I come in a pair , water , rain , rocks , and wind ruin me , what am I ? <p> ANSWER : The letter " r " <p> There are three men : a deaf man , a mute and a blind man . The mute saw the deaf man steal the blind man 's money . How does the mute tell the blind man about it ? <p> ANSWER : The mute would most likely use brail to convey to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whom . <p> I 'm a type of road , but if you separate me in a certain place , you will have 2 new words . 1 of these words is 8 letters in length , &amp; the other means ' eat ' . What am I ? ? ? <p> ANSWER : The road is " thoroughfare " and when broken apart , you have " thorough " and " fare " - which does n't really mean " eat " but it has something to do with eating . So we 're calling this one solved and note that the riddle most likely should read " &amp; the other means ' food ' " . <p> The age of Ann &amp; Bill now add up to 91 . Ann is now 3 times as old as Bill was at the time when Ann was twice as old as Bill is now . How old are Ann &amp; Bill now ? <p> ANSWER - Thankfully , a solution and explanation for this riddle . It really is just a simple math - well , maybe not " simple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solved this one ! Roy explains it this way : Ages are Ann = 63 , Bill = 28. 7 Years ago , they were Ann was 56 , twice the age Bill is now . 7 Years ago , Bill was 21 , Ann is now 3 times his age . <p> This is just a simple Algebra problem , 3 simultaneous equations : A = Ann 's Age now , B= Bill 's age , X = some number of years in the past . <p> The equations to solve are : <p> A + B = 91 A = 3 * ( B - x ) ( A - x ) = 2 * B <p> Ed provided this lengthy explanation , but thorough and we offer it for full explanation of this riddle : <p> The answer is that Anne is now 63 , and Bill is 28 . How does this come about ? Dust off your calculus books , kids , here we go ( excuse the length of this note , by the way . It takes some time ) ! First , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ age now , Y = Bill 's age now , A = Ann 's age ' then ' , B = Bill 's age ' then ' , and T = # of years between now and ' then ' . Here are the equations ' given ' to us by the question : X + Y = 91 A = 2Y X = 3B X - T = A Y - T = B <p> OK so far ? Here comes the math part . Since T = both X - A and Y - B , both of these equal each other , or : X - A = Y - B since X = 3B amd Y = 0.5A ( A = 2Y , same thing ) , we can sub in these values and get : 3B - A = 0.5A - B Multiply everything by 2 ( because you can ) and you get : 6B - 2A = A - 2B Now add 2B and 2A to each side , and you have : 8B = 3A Which means that B = ( 3/8 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good does this do us ? Well , we can then plug these values back into the equations above , and solve for T in terms of each individual variable . Confused ? Here 's the math to isolate T with B : T = X - A ---&gt; given T = 3B - ( 8/3 ) B ---&gt; sub in for A T = ( 9/3 ) B - ( 8/3 ) B ----&gt; 3 = 9/3 T = ( 1/3 ) B ---&gt; what we were looking for . <p> Ok , using a very similar method , we get that T = ( 1/8 ) A. Now we can sub in these values to isolate T with X and Y. Showing all the math for T with X : T = ( 1/3 ) B ----&gt;what we solved before T = ( 1/3 ) x ( 1/3 ) X ---&gt; since X = 3B , B = ( 1/3 ) X T = ( 1/9 ) X ---&gt; Hey ! this is useful ! <p> Ca n't resist adding this one from John - Ugh , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recognize that there are two different values for Ann 's or Bill 's age depending upon whether it is the part of the riddle that is talking about them in the past or whether it is talking about them in the present . The Difference in years from the past to the present ( which is n't given ) will be represented by the letter ' D ' . <p> Ann is now 63 ( 3 times as old as bill at start ) and Bill is now 28 = 91 years <p> AND , one more from John- <p> Ann and Bill now add up to 91 ==&gt; A + B = 91 Ann is now 3 times as old as Bill was at time x =&gt; A = 3 Bx At time x , Ann was twice as old as Bill is now =&gt; Ax = 2B <p> 3 equations and 4 unknowns - what is the forth equation ? . The difference between Ann 's age now and Ann 's age at time x , is the same as the difference between Bill 's age now and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - Bx <p> ANSWER : Tomorrow ! Another answer is " A contradiction " . And also , a human being . However , Jared writes : This is a correction to the amswer to one of your unsolvable riddles . The " I am what I am not " , riddle is actually the past . " Am " is a present progressive word , something that is . The past was , and is n't , and never will be- only was . Therefore , the past fits into both parts of the riddle saying " I am what I am not , " and " I 'm not what I am . " The past can not BE anything because it WAS . <p> What happens 4 times a week twice a month and once a year ? ( Corrected should read : What happens 4 time in every week , twice in every month and once in a year ? <p> ANSWER : The letter " e " . <p> There are 100 prisoners in a prison . In the center of the prison is a room with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rest of the prison ( i.e. no one can see in ) . The only thing the room contains is a sole light that can be turned on and off . The warden begins placing a random prisoner in the room each night , and let 's them turn the light on or off . He explains to the prisoners that if one of them comes to him , and tells him that all 100 of them have been in the room , he will let them go , but if they are wrong , all the prisoners will be killed for their stupidity . The prisoners are allowed to meet one night and discuss their plan , but they can have no contact from then on out . What plan can guarantee them success ? <p> ANSWER : Thanks to all of you who sent great solutions for this riddle . Almost everyone writes that the plan the prisoners must make is as follows : Each time a prisoner is put into this special cell , he must do something to prove he was there - and he must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chosen more than once ) . What that proof is - the prisoners agree on that during their once allowed meeting ; the proof could be a scratch on the wall , a fingernail left in a certain spot , a mark of some kind on the floor , etc . They have a light in the room so the light could be the reference point as to where to leave the proof . Each night , the randomly chosen prisoner will count the proof left and when 100 is attained , he gets to tell the warden that all 100 prisoners have been in the cell - they all go free ! ! <p> Interesting thoughts on this riddle : an obvious solution is that the prisoners have their once allowed meeting in that very cell - at that point each of the 100 prisoners will have been in the cell - hence they are free to go ! Also , the fact that the riddle says there is a light that can be turned on and off - most of you believe - and I agree - that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact that it can be turned on to count the proof and turned off so the guard wo n't see the proof readily . It seems the most difficult part of this riddle is for the prisoners to decide on how to leave proof they were in the room - but that is the key to this one . <p> A very simple Riddle , all you have to do is ask yourself - What would happen if you went to the root and just added water ? <p> ANSWER : Thanks to Tim who writes : <p> This riddle comes from the " Net Riddle " .

The reference to the stars ' basement is analogous to things being leaked without their permission/knowledge by people whose job it is to sort through the personal lives and sordid details concerning the stars .

This riddle is very similar to another riddle we 've heard often : You can see it with the naked eye.When put into a barrel , it makes the barrel lighter even though the object itself is weightless . Thanks to everyone who helped solve this one ! ! <p> A man was in jail and had a visitor and when the visitor left the guard asked him who the visitor was , the man said , " I have no brothers or sisters , but that was my father 's son . " How could that be ? <p> ANSWER : As the riddle is stated , two best answers have come in . The first is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ technically his " brother " . The other is that the visitor is the son of the prisoner 's priest ( father ) . Perhaps the most logical solution is that the riddle is written incorrectly and as John states it : " Brothers and sisters I have none , but that man 's son is my father 's son . " That 's how it 's supposed to read . Thus the man visiting is the prisoner 's father . Good thinking - nicely done ! <p> A guy has to a cross a river filled with man eating animals , by climbing a bridge to get to a princess with whom he wants to stay for the rest of his life . but on the bridge is a guard who will chase him back as soon as he is spotted . the guard sleeps for 5mins and watches for 10mins and the guy can cross the bridge in 7 mins . How can he ever get to the princess at the top of the bridge without being spotted . <p> ANSWER : Lots of answers for this one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to fear - all he has to do is push the guard into the river - as the animals are " man eating " - the animals will eat the guard and the man can do what he wants . OR , the princess would be completely safe in the river since she is not a man and the princess could swim over to the man and then the man would not have to even bother with the bridge . <p> More traditional answers are : From Liam- A bridge is half a circle , so for 5 mins ( or less depending on the height of the hero ) .... say 2.4 mins crawling , he 's outa sight . He works out when the guard is gon na sleep , takes 2.3 mins off that , and sets off By the time the hero reaches tha apex the guard is asleep for 5 min , so the hero has 2.3 + 5 mins = 7.3 mins before the guard wakes up . Well within the 7 minute time AND , from many , many visitors ( thanks ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the guard goes to sleep the guy starts to walk across the bridge . As soon ( or just before ) the guard wakes up , the guy starts walking the OPPOSITE way . The guard , seeing the man walking back where he came from but not knowing this , immediately chases him and chases the man to his destination . It helps that the guy will have covered over half the distance before the guard wakes up . ( This is the most popular answer for this one . ) AND here is another popular way to approach this one- Because the princess is at the top of the bridge , it means that she is at the middle . Therefore , if she is at the middle , and he takes 7 minutes to cross the bridge , he can reach the middle of the bridge in 3.5 minutes . Therefore , while the guard is asleep for 5 minutes he can go and safely rescue the princess . Even if the guard wakes up , he will be already leaving with the princess in tow . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bridge by hanging on underneath the bridge - clever idea ! SOME of you said something like this : It says on the riddle that he has to climb the bridge and not cross it . If he climbs on top of the bridge , the guard will not spot him . My answer is that he has to climb the bridge to get to his princess . <p> there are 27 A. of the B. of R. what does A. stand for ; what does B. stand for and what does R. stand for <p> ANSWER : As the riddle is written - 27 Amendments of the Bill of Rights However , as Chris , Stacie , Mike , Leonard and Melanie note : the solution that you are supposed to give for this is as follows : There are 27 Amendments of the Bill of Rights .
