@@83190208 @4690208/ <h> Causes of Decline <p> The decline of the freshwater pearl mussel has resulted from failure to recruit young mussels to populations . The cause of these recruitment failures is damage to the species ' habitat , specifically through hydrological , sedimentation , other morphological and enrichment impacts . <p> The species is extremely sensitive to environmental perturbations , owing to its complex life-cycle and vulnerable habitat . It is very long-lived , surviving for between 35 and 200 years across its natural range ( c. 100-years , on average , in Ireland ) . Juvenile and young freshwater pearl mussels are even more sensitive than adult mussels , as they live buried in the substratum for five or more years . This habit prevents the very small mussels from being washed away by fast-flowing water , but leaves them particularly vulnerable to habitat degradation . Subtle changes in hydrology can lead to erosion and permanent loss of juvenile substratum , as well as damage through habitat exposure during low-flow . Hydrological changes can also exacerbate sedimentation and enrichment impacts . Sediment settling on and in the river bed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mussels of an oxygen supply . By clogging interstitial spaces , fine sediment may also prevent new juveniles from moving into the substratum . Increased nutrient loads promote growth of filamentous algae , diatoms and other algae that also act as physical barriers between the open water and the river bed . Where mussel habitat is impacted by increases in both fine sediment and nutrients , rooted plants expand and tend to further exacerbate the problem . Respiration of rooted plants and algae causes night-time drops in oxygen in mussel habitats . <p> Organic matter contributes significantly to the degradation of freshwater pearl mussel habitat , because decomposers have high oxygen demands and can cause severe deoxygenation of the river bed , as well as creating the physical barrier of fungal and bacterial biomass . Organic matter may be particulate ( of various sizes ) or dissolved and can originate from within the river itself ( e.g. dying algae or rooted plants ) or be lost to water from land . Land-based losses can come from human waste , animal waste ( e.g. slurry or farmyard manure ) , industrial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where peat or peaty soils are drained or otherwise damaged ) , decaying vegetation ( e.g. needles and woody debris left behind after clear-fell harvesting of plantation forestry ) , and other sources . <p> The freshwater pearl mussel ensures its survival by existing in large populations and producing large numbers of offspring every year . The resilience of a population is increased through its distribution and density , as well as its absolute size . Viable populations have a widespread distribution , occupying all available habitat in high densities . As the juvenile mussels remain buried in the river substratum for a period of five or more years , the habitat must be constantly maintained in good condition over the long-term . Even temporary declines in condition can lead to the loss of all juveniles produced in the previous five years .

It has been said that you can experience ten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accommodate Clara Bog . This refers to the influence that the last Ice Age had on the Irish landscape . To the north of the bog , an esker runs in an east-west direction . Eskers were laid down by retreating glaciars over 10,000 years ago . These glaciars would also have scooped out a low-lying area south of Clara which would have become a shallow lake . Approximately 8,000 years ago , this lake would have become overgrown with reeds and in time the area would have gradually turned into a fen , and then , as decyaing plant growth chokes the fen , mosses take over and the bog is born . The bog lays down so much peat that it becomes raised above the surrounding landscape . This gives it a dome shape and its name . It differs from blanket bog which is found in upland regions . Raised bog is much deeper . <p> Clara Bog contains fine examples of hummocks , hollows , lawns , pools and flushes ; all classic components of a raised bog . Typically a bog becomes mildly acidic . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important part of what makes Clara Bog special .

The small bird of prey , the Merlin , breeds here . More common bogland birds include the Meadow Pipit and Skylark .

At Clara , restoration work has had a positive impact in sustaining , and in some areas , adding to , the levels of good quality active raised bogland . Understanding hydrology ( the relationship between water and land in terms of water table and drainage , etc. ) is key to the survival of any bogland , as water is the lifeblood of a bog . Blocking off drainage ditches is one of the key parts to the management at Clara . We can play our part too by respecting this delicate environment .

It has been said that you can experience ten thousand years of history in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the influence that the last Ice Age had on the Irish landscape . To the north of the bog , an esker runs in an east-west direction . Eskers were laid down by retreating glaciars over 10,000 years ago . These glaciars would also have scooped out a low-lying area south of Clara which would have become a shallow lake . Approximately 8,000 years ago , this lake would have become overgrown with reeds and in time the area would have gradually turned into a fen , and then , as decyaing plant growth chokes the fen , mosses take over and the bog is born . The bog lays down so much peat that it becomes raised above the surrounding landscape . This gives it a dome shape and its name . It differs from blanket bog which is found in upland regions . Raised bog is much deeper . <p> Clara Bog contains fine examples of hummocks , hollows , lawns , pools and flushes ; all classic components of a raised bog . Typically a bog becomes mildly acidic .

The esker ridges are rich in grassland wildflowers , including wild orchids . <p> Animal Life <p> The drier areas of the bog are dominated by heather and this provides good cover for Red Grouse , Snipe and Curlew .

The small bird of prey , the Merlin , breeds here . More common bogland birds include the Meadow Pipit and Skylark .

At Clara , restoration work has had a positive impact in sustaining , and in some areas , adding to , the levels of good quality active raised bogland . Understanding hydrology ( the relationship between water and land in terms of water table and drainage , etc. ) is key to the survival of any bogland , as water is the lifeblood of a bog .

Across this range reefs may be subjected to strong tidal currents . The structure of reefs varies from bedrock to boulders or cobbles while topography ranges from horizontal to vertical and the reefs may have numerous ledges and crevices . The geology includes limestone , shale , granite , schists and gneiss . All of these factors affect both the species present and their abundance . Their depth range is unknown but is likely to extend below 1200 m . Typical species change with increasing depth . Brown fucoid algae generally dominate the intertidal down to shallow subtidal areas . The latter are characterised by kelp species , frequently with an understorey of red foliose algae . Below the kelp and down to about 30 m @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ algae . Below this , the habitat is characterised by faunal species ; very few foliose or filamentous red algae occur although encrusting red algae may be common . <h> Biogenic reefs <p> The shallowest reefs are intertidal , including honeycomb reefs made by the polychaete worm Sabellaria alveolata and reefs made by the mussel Mytilus edulis . Sublittoral biogenic reefs in Ireland include : <p> 1 ) Serpula Reefs <p> The polychaete worm Serpula vermicularis secretes a calcareous tube and is common as a solitary worm . However under sheltered conditions with a very gentle tidal stream the worms aggregate and form structures which may be up to 1 m in height and about 2 m in diameter . The spaces between the worm tubes are inhabited by a wide variety of species such as brittlestars and crabs but will vary from place to place . In Ireland such reefs have a very limited distribution and are only know from three localities where they occur from depths of 2 " 19 m . <p> 2 ) Sabellaria Reefs <p> These are constructed by the polychaete worm Sabellaria spinulosa , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as being constructed by S. alveolata . The reefs are constructed of sand grains by the worm and form a substrate for many other species that would not normally be present in the area in the absence of the reefs . The reefs can be up to a metre in thickness . <p> 3 ) Bivalve Reefs <p> Mussels occur intertidally on rocky shores , particularly on exposed coastlines where they occur in large patches and can be a characterising species but generally remain small . Mussels also form reefs on sediment where there is some hard substratum for attachment . They may also occur in sheltered , tide-swept areas where they reach a much larger size . Native Oyster Ostrea edulis beds , when undisturbed , also form reef-like structures . <p> 4 ) Cold Water Coral Reefs <p> Cold water coral reefs are from 200 " 1600 m , where the water temperature is 4 " 8-C and the salinity is 32 " 36% . Coral reefs found to date are generally associated with carbonate mounds , features that rise up to 300-500 m above the sea floor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and on the Rockall Bank . Corals are also recorded on the Hatton Bank . The typical reef forming species are Lophelia pertusa and Madrepora oculata .

Whereas 5,000 pairs are estimated to have bred in the late 1980s , there now remains no more than 150 pairs . This represents a 97% decline . Breeding productivity is so low that population viability analysis predicts that in the absence of any action , the Curlew will go extinct as a breeding species in Ireland within 5-10 years . A Curlew Task Force has been established with all major stakeholders represented , with a view to progressing action for Curlew conservation. - <p> For the latest on a pilot Curlew Conservation Programme starting in 2017 please follow the relevant links below :

@@83190679 @4690679/ 180070 @qwx800070 <h> Marine Licensing <p> A number of principal legal instruments exist in Ireland for the purposes of conserving and protecting its natural heritage . The Wildlife ( Amendment ) Act 1976-2005 provides a wide-ranging basis for the protection of habitats and species throughout Ireland . The 1992 EU Habitats Directive ( Council Directive 92/43/EC ) was transposed into Irish law by the 1997 European Communities ( Natural Habitats ) Regulations ( SI 94 of 1997 ) . This legislation requires the establishment of Special Areas of Conservation ( SACs ) to conserve habitats and species listed on Annex I and II respectively of the Directive . To ensure effective conservation of protected habitats and species in SACs , all operations and activities in or adjacent to SACs likely to have a significant effect thereon require an appropriate assessment . The 1979 EC Birds Directive ( codified 2009/147/EC ) also makes legal provision for the designation of Special Protection Areas and for the protection of wild birds and their habitats through the European Union . <p> It is the responsibility of individual Regulatory Authorities in Ireland to ensure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the delivery of their statutory functions . In practice , Regulatory Authorities circulate all relevant applications to a list of Statutory Consultees for observations to inform their decision concerning an application . The National Parks and Wildlife Service provides observations and advice concerning national and international nature conservation obligations to these Regulatory Authorities when so requested . <p> The Irish Foreshore is defined in the 1933 Foreshore Act as the area of seafloor below the high water line of a medium tide ; currently , the foreshore extends out from shore to the 12 nautical mile zone . Many developments on the foreshore require a consent administered by the Foreshore Section of the Department of the Environment , Heritage &amp; Local Government and potentially interested parties should liaise with that Section . Activities on the foreshore relating to aquaculture and sea fisheries are administered by the Coastal Zone Management Division at the Department of Agriculture , Fisheries and Food . Dredging and dumping at sea licences are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency . The Petroleum Affairs Division of the Department of Communications , Energy and Natural Resources regulates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ functions for themselves and others with respect to the shoreline immediately above that defined as foreshore in the 1933 Foreshore Act while Harbour Boards also have regulatory powers with respect to designated harbour areas . All the Regulatory Authorities concerned have a legal obligation to ensure that operations or activities that are likely to have a significant effect on the protected habitats and/or species in a Special Area of Conservation are subject to an appropriate assessment . However , it should also be noted that the National Parks and Wildlife Service is also a Regulatory Authority for specified activities not otherwise licensable by other bodies ( i.e. , for activities requiring consent as listed for each designated site ) . The legal obligations arising from nature conservation legislation must be applied by all such Authorities . <p> Article 12 of the Habitats Directive and Regulation 23 of S.I . 94 of 1997 further requires that the requisite measures are taken to establish a system of strict protection for the animal species listed in Annex IV ( a ) in their natural range , prohibiting <p> all forms of deliberate capture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; <p> deliberate disturbance of these species , particularly during the period of breeding , rearing , hibernation and migration ; <p> deliberate destruction or taking of eggs from the wild ; <p> deterioration or destruction of breeding sites or resting places . <p> This applies to all life stages of these listed animals . In addition , the Wildlife ( Amendment ) Act , 1976-2005 confers specific protection on seals , whales , dolphins and porpoises . Under the Act , it is an offence to hunt ( except in some instances under licence or Ministerial permit ) , injure ( except when hunting under such licence ) or wilfully interfere with or destroy the breeding place of a protected species . Whilst appropriate assessments are aimed at Annex II species for which a SAC has been designated and are not required to address these protection requirements , relevant parties are encouraged to undertake a risk assessment to ensure their proposed operations/activities are compliant with these legal obligations . <p> In 2010 , the Department of the Environment , Heritage &amp; Local Government produced general guidance for planning authorities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ireland.The principles and general approach to the appropriate assessment process outlined in that publication equally apply to Regulatory Authorities in the marine sector . <p> It has been prepared by technical personnel within the Department who review and provide advice in relation to development applications within the statutory consultation process . <p> In releasing this document , the Department envisages that relevant stakeholders involved in the preparation of Natura Impact Statements would benefit from some insight into the likely considerations of the Department 's technical personnel for appropriate assessment purposes .
