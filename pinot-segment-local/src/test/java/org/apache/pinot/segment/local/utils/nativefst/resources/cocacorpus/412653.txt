Revisions to the original metal 6L6 such as increased power handling and glass envelopes yielded new designations such as 6L6G , 6L6GA , 6L6GB and finally 6L6GC ( introduced by GE in the late 1950s ) . Today , the 6L6GC is one of the most common power tubes used for electric guitar amplification and there is an almost overwhelming supply of current production options to choose from . The purpose of this comparison is simply to provide guitar players with a frame of reference to help in finding the best current production 6L6GC for their needs . <p> Also included in this comparison are direct substitutes for the 6L6GC including : KT66 and 5881. <h> 6L6GC Basics <p> The 6L6GC is an octal , beam power tube .

There is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tube can only be plugged in one way . <p> The beam power part tells us that the tube , as RCA put it , " is a tetrode or pentode in which directed electron beams are used to increase substantially the power-handling capability of the tube . A feature of a beam power tube is its low screen-grid current . Because of the effective suppressor action provided by space charge and because of the low current drawn by the screen grid , the beam power tube has the advantages of high power output , high power sensitivity , and high efficiency .

Each tube sample used for comparison was chosen because it measured in the middle range of idle plate current draw at the same operating point set by a Maxi-Matcher Digital Tube Tester : Va = 400VDC , Vg1 = -48VDC , Ia 24mA . <h> The Listening Test <p> A custom 6L6GC switching box was constructed to allow for a quick switch comparison of two tubes at a time while plugged into the V2 socket of the same fixed bias , single-ended guitar amplifier used for the frequency sweep . Listening tests were then conducted while playing guitar and switching between the tubes at various amplifier control settings to come up with " guitarist 's opinion " descriptions for each tube .

@@46754771 @254771/ <p> The power rating of a guitar speaker is an indication of how much power it can handle without being damaged thermally or mechanically . It is not an indication of how loud the speaker will sound in comparison to other speakers . Let 's examine the basics of how speakers work , how the power rating is determined and look at things from the perspective of the guitar amplifier so that we can choose guitar speakers that will last a lifetime . <h> How an Electrodynamic Loudspeaker Works <p> Guitar speakers are a type of loudspeaker known as electrodynamic or " moving coil " loudspeakers . The magnetic circuit ( composed of front plate , back plate , pole piece and magnet ) and voice-coil make up the motor of a guitar speaker . An alternating electrical current flowing through the voice-coil generates an alternating magnetic field perpendicular to flow of current through the coil . The magnetic circuit creates a strongly focused magnetic field in the air gap between the front plate and the pole piece on which the voice-coil is centered . The voice-coil is pushed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between these two magnetic fields . Since the speaker cone is connected to the voice-coil , it now has a mechanical force with which to push air particles and make sound . <h> Thermal Damage <p> Speakers are transducers . They convert electrical energy provided by an amplifier into acoustical energy . They are actually very inefficient transducers because most of the electrical energy is converted into heat instead of sound . The reference efficiency ( ratio of acoustic power out to electrical power in ) for most guitar speakers is around 2% to 6% , which means that 98% to 94% of the electrical energy is dissipated in the form of heat . <p> From the aspect of power dissipation , a guitar speaker can be modeled as a resistor . Most guitar amp enthusiasts are familiar with the equation for electrical power and how it can be used to determine the power dissipated across a resistor . Resistors can be thought of as transducers that intentionally convert electrical energy to heat in order to create a voltage drop . Resistors have a power rating that indicates how much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is analogous to the speaker power rating . <p> The voice-coil is the electrical interface of the speaker and is given a " nominal impedance " specification ( e.g. 4 , 8 or 16 ohm ) which can be used to approximate power dissipation when connected to an amplifier . ( The actual impedance of the voice-coil varies with frequency ) . Just as a resistor will eventually burn up if its power rating is not high enough , the speaker 's voice-coil will burn up if it is overpowered by the amplifier . One of the most common symptoms of an overpowered speaker is a burned voice-coil , which usually measures as an open circuit on an ohm meter . No sound can be produced by a speaker with an open voice-coil . An overheated voice-coil former may also become warped and begin to rub against the pole piece causing the speaker to buzz loudly . <h> Mechanical Damage <p> Loudspeakers can be damaged mechanically by over-excursion of the voice-coil and cone . This is more common with old speakers that have worn suspensions and adhesives , but may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's useable frequency range . When over-excursion occurs , the voice-coil can become misaligned or bottom out . The cone and suspension ( surround and spider ) can also become stretched or torn . <h> How the Speaker Power Rating is Determined <p> Many speaker manufacturers rate their speakers based on industry standards similar to IEC 60268-5 or AES2-1984 . These standards specify a pink noise test signal with a crest factor of two ( i.e. 6 dB ) which is meant to simulate the transient character of music having an average value , as well as frequent instantaneous voltage spikes that swing up to twice the average value . Pink noise is a particular type of random noise with equal energy per octave and actually sounds like a space shuttle launch . The test signal is applied to the test speaker for a few hours , allowing for a reasonable way to test the speaker 's real world thermal and mechanical capabilities . After testing , the speaker must be in working order , without permanent alteration of its technical features . The power rating is calculated using the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of electrical impedance within the working range of the speaker . <h> Guitar Amplifier Power Output Ratings <p> The power output rating of a guitar amp is mostly a ballpark figure for what it can put out . Amp specifications commonly list power output in a form similar to the following : <p> Power Output : 50W into 8ohm at 5% THD <p> This type of power output rating is obtained by using a sine wave from a signal generator ( usually 1 kHz ) as the input signal . The 5% THD ( total harmonic distortion ) figure means that the sine wave was able to generate 50W of power output with relatively low distortion ( near the threshold of clipping or overdrive ) . THD measurements were one of the first conventions used to objectively compare the fidelity of audio amplifiers . <p> Guitar amps are unconventional audio amplifiers . While most audio amplifiers are designed to keep distortion as low as possible , guitar amplification has evolved to where overdrive distortion is usually a requirement . For example , the Marshall- JCM800 2203 is a 100W tube @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ owner 's manual lists the power output as follows : <p> This example shows that for many guitar amplifiers , the power output rating ( 100W in this case ) is not a maximum power output rating , but more of a ballpark clean power output specification . <h> RMS and Overdrive Distorion <p> RMS ( root mean square ) is a kind of average value that can be used to compare the power dissipation from different signals on equal terms . For example , a 20 VDC power supply dissipates the same amount of heat across an 8 ohm resistor as a sine wave with an RMS value of 20 VAC . <p> Guitar amp output ratings are usually based on a sine wave at low distortion , but if the volume is turned up further or a gain boosting effect is used , the sine wave becomes more overdriven and can approach the shape of a square wave . The RMS value of a square wave is equal to its amplitude , while the RMS value of a sine wave is equal to its amplitude divided by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the equation for power shows that a square wave dissipates twice as much power across the same load as a sine wave with the same amplitude . <p> This simplified overdrive distortion model illustrates how the 100 watt Marshall- amp which puts out 115 watts at 4% THD could put out an additional 50 watts at 10% THD . <h> Tube vs . Solid State Outputs <p> Many tube guitar amps use output transformers with secondary taps connected to an impedance switch allowing for the same power output when connected to 4 , 8 or 16 ohm load impedances . Solid state amps do not use output transformers and do not have the same power output when connected to different load impedances . <p> For tube outputs , it 's important to match the load impedance to the amp 's output impedance . For solid state outputs , it 's important to use a load that is greater than or equal to the rated minimum load impedance and to know the amp 's power output at that load . For example , the Fender M-80 is a solid state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ohms and 94 W(RMS) at 5% THD into 4 ohms ( the minimum load impedance ) . <p> With solid-state amps , overdrive distortion generated by the power-amp is not generally considered musically pleasing , so most people will not exceed the amp 's low THD power rating . Tube power amps , on the other hand , are often played well beyond their low THD rating . <h> Amps with Multiple Speakers <p> When an amp uses multiple speakers the output power is divided between them . The nominal impedance of each speaker should be the same value so that power is distributed equally and so that the output impedance of the amplifier can be matched . <h> Choosing Guitar Speakers to Last a Lifetime <p> There is no standard method used by all amp manufacturers when selecting an appropriate speaker power rating . If you want to choose a speaker to last a lifetime , you 'll want to choose a speaker that can handle the maximum amount of preamp and power amp overdrive distortion that can possibly be put into it and safely avoid exceeding the speaker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ setups , this means choosing a speaker rated for at least twice the rated output power of the amp . For multiple speakers , choose twice the rated power that would be distributed to it . <p> You might decide to go with a lower power rating because you know that you 'll never be cranked at full power and love the sound of a lower power rated speaker . In the same way you may choose a speaker with a much higher power rating because of the way it sounds . <p> A Real World Example : Speakers for a Fender- ' 65 Twin Reverb- Reissue <p> 1 ) Determine the rated output power of the amp.Amplifiers have two power ratings : power consumption and power output . The power consumption is always much higher than the power output . In this case the output power is 85 watts RMS and the power consumption is 260 watts . <p> 2 ) Determine the output impedance for that output power rating.In this case it is 4 ohm . <p> 3 ) Determine the number of speakers.In this case there are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parallel for an overall impedance of 4 ohms . <p> For this amp , speaker choices to last a lifetime should be rated for at least 85 watts each . There are a lot of speaker choices rated for 100 watts and this rating would be very safe . Actually , the stock speaker for this amp is the Jensen C12K and it is rated for 100 watts . <p> By Kurt Prange ( BSEE ) , Sales Engineer for Antique Electronic Supply - based in Tempe , AZ .

@@46754790 @254790/ <h> Graph Interpretation <p> All 12AX7 tubes have an amplification factor ( ++ ) of 100 ( " high-mu " ) . Ideally , every 12AX7 should yield the same gain when placed in the same circuit . However , in reality there are comparative gain differences among 12AX7s . <p> This graph is based on the average gain and noise measured from different tube brands using the same number of samples for each brand . It should not be assumed that every single 12AX7 from a specific brand will match its place on this graph . <p> The gain rating is only a relative reference ( e.g. a rating of " 10 " does not mean ten times louder than a " 1 " ) . <p> This long plate Russian tube has a straightforward tone with mid focused clarity . <h> A Comparison of Current Production 12AX7 Tubes <p> RCA and Sylvania first introduced the 12AX7 to the world in the late 1940 's . Today , it is by far the most common preamp tube used for electric guitar amplification and there is an almost overwhelming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purpose of this comparison is simply to provide guitar players with a frame of reference to help in finding the best current production 12AX7 for their needs . <p> Also included in this comparison are direct substitutes for the 12AX7 including : ECC83 , ECC803 , 7025 and 5751. <h> 12AX7 Basics <p> The 12AX7 is a 9-pin miniature , high-mu , twin triode . What does that mean ? The 9-pin miniature part tells us what kind of socket the tube plugs into . It has nine thin pins arranged along the circumference of a circle with a diameter of just under half of an inch . There is a large gap between pins 1 and 9 to ensure that the tube can only be plugged in one way . The high-mu part is referring to the electronic specification called " amplification factor , " abbreviated by the Greek letter ++ ( mu - pronounced ' myoo ' ) . This gives us a general category of amplification that the tube was designed for as compared to other preamp tube types like the " medium-mu " 12AU7 . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and independent triodes contained within the one tube . A triode is the most basic tube structure that allows for signal amplification and it has three electrodes : plate , grid and cathode . <h> The Gain Test Setup <p> Each tube sample was tested in the same ( Fender black face style ) preamp circuit as shown in the schematic below with bass and treble set to their maximum . A frequency generator was used to measure voltage gain and plot the frequency response from 10 Hz to 18,000 Hz . From the frequency plot it could be seen that there are three extrema at about 50 Hz , 400 Hz and 4,000 Hz . These three frequencies were then used to quickly measure the low , mid and high frequency voltage gain on the same number of samples for each tube in our comparison . The average from each tube 's samples was then calculated and used for comparison . The smallest average low frequency gain tube was used as the reference for a gain of " 1 " and the largest average low frequency gain tube was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " . This gain reference method was then repeated for both the mid and high frequency averages . <h> The Noise Test Setup <p> Each tube sample was again tested in the same preamp circuit and an oscilloscope was connected to the amplifier output to monitor the amplitude of the voltage spike produced by tapping on the tube 's glass envelope . The average voltage spike from each tube 's samples was then calculated and used for comparison . <h> The Listening Test setup <p> A custom 12AX7 switching box was constructed to allow for a quick switch comparison of six tubes at a time while plugged into the V1 socket of a Marshall JCM800 2203 guitar amplifier .

@@46754929 @254929/ <p> Great tone players around the world love . The Alumitone series Humbuckers still have those extended highs and lows that they always have . As always , they offer a distinctive , modern , hi-tech look that will get anyone 's attention . This radical departure from pickup design is aluminum based , rather than copper . Result : less resistance , higher output coupled to a " current driven design " as opposed to conventional voltage based pickups .

Many popular rock guitar sounds are based on the well known sounds created by the guitar legends of the sixties and seventies . Guitar players cranked up their amps to full when played loud because the output stage starts to saturate and delivers the most musical and harmonic distortion , wonderful sustain , and a thick tone with overall response .

The Silencer features our new " Natural Tone Technology " which does not affect the brightness or the definition of the guitar signal . It will keep all it 's clarity . <p> Can I use the Silencer without speakers ? With the POWER switch in " LOAD " position the Silencer will work without any speaker connected . It works as a plain Load Box . The signal can be taken from the adjustable LINE-Out ( plain ) or from the F.A.N.T.A.-Out to feed a recording system , the mixing console , a slave amp etc . This is a common setting for in-ear-monitoring or home recording . <p> How does the LINE-Out and the F.A.N.T.A. Speaker Simulation work ? The LINE-Out is an unfiltered output with adjustable volume as used to feed LINE-Level devices . It uses a + " phone jack ( mono ) . The F.A.N.T.A. ( Frequency Adapted Natural Tone Accessory ) Speaker Emulation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It provides a 3-pin XLR connector for a standard microphone cable to connect to the mixing console , recording system etc .. The signal runs trough a sophisticated speaker emulation which features a unique quality : it is reacting to your playing style ! Clean signals will sound clear and bright with only slight compression but if you play distorted the emulation will sound smooth , punchy and big bottomed with good compression . Just what you expect from the perfect speaker cabinet . This is what separates the Silencer from most common speaker emulators ; the F.A.N.T.A. Emulation will respond to your playing and reacts like a real speaker system . You wo n't need to mic the amp anymore . <p> Can the Silencer damage my amp or speakers ? No ! The Silencer is made exactly to the specs of the impedance it bears . If power gets attenuated then your speaker(s) will work safer than under real full power . If you play loud your tubes will wear out a bit faster , but since the Silencer is matched exactly to your amps impedance this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needs to see a load . It is dangerous to drive a tube amp without a load so make sure to use good speaker cables . This is true for all tube amps.
