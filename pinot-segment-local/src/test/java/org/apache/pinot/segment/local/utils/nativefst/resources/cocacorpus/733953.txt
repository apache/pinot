The ROS and nitrogen species produced during stress may damage crucial biomolecules of the retinal pigment epithelium ( RPE ) cells . There is a strong relation between stress oxidative and inflammatory response in the pathology of the AMD . Actually , there are many routes of oxidative stress related with AMD but the most representative are : autophagy/heterophagy , apoptosis , and iron , DNA and antioxidant enzymes . Autophagy is a cellular housekeeping process that removes damaged organelles and protein aggregates , whereas heterophagy , in the case of the RPE , is the phagocytosis of exogenous photoreceptor outer segments .

Dr. Sternberg is a translational research scientist with expertise in CNS ( multiple sclerosis , ischemic stroke , Alzheimer 's disease ) and Vascular/ Metabolic ( atherosclerosis/ vascular diseases , hypercholesterolemia , diabetes ) disorders . Her research interests include Biomarkers of inflammation and neurodegeneration in multiple sclerosis , and Alzheimer 's disease , Autonomic dysfunction as it applies to autoimmune and neurodegenerative diseases Inflammation , platelet function , and antiplatelet resistance in ischemic stroke Vascular disease in autoimmune and neurodegenerative diseases , Mechanisms of action of drugs to treat vascular/ metabolic diseases-genomic differences . <p> Dr. David Rae Harder began his scientific career at the Medical College of Wisconsin ( MCW ) where he completed his PhD degree in the Department of Biophysics in 1976 . After a brief post-doctoral fellowship at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tennessee University as an Assistant Professor of Physiology . During this period , he made his first seminal discovery in cardiovascular biology ( Harder and Coulson , 1979 ) . He identified functional estrogen receptors on vascular smooth muscle of the coronary artery , and demonstrated its role in modifying inward Ca2+ current in coronary arterial smooth muscle and control of blood flow to the heart . This was a major contribution to our understanding of coronary physiology and explains some of the differences between gender and cardiac function . In 1983 , he was recruited back to MCW as an Associate Professor in Neurology and Physiology and quickly became the Director of Neurology Research at MCW . During this period , he made his second seminal discovery , which was the underlying mechanism associated with blood flow autoregulation ( Harder , 1984 ) . This paper is a citation classic and has been largely responsible for our understanding of the mechanism of blood flow autoregulation in the brain , kidney and other vascular beds . These organs are knownto maintain a relatively constant blood flow despite large changes in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ test of time , and has been confirmed by several leading laboratories across the world . The discovery has spawned mechanistic studies into the second messenger systems involved such as DAG , PKC , 20-HETE and other metabolites of poly unsaturated fatty acids ( PUFAs ) . In addition , this work has initiated many tangential studies defining the role of membrane stretch in triggering this response . Studies are still being performed in defining mechanisms triggering this response including TRP channels , Ca2+ influx , Na-H exchange and numerous other signaling events ( Roman , 2002 ) . He received the AHA established investigator award for this work , and was chosen for the Veterans Administration Research Career Scientist Award . In 1987 , he was elected to the Royal Society of Medicine in London , and was promoted to full Professor with tenure in the Department of Physiology at MCW . Perhaps , his most prolific work was yet to come in hindsight since his trajectory over the next five years was simply put , ' meteoric ' . In 1990 , he received the Method to Extend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is given to select individuals with outstanding track records of sustained funding . Within two years , he became the founding director of the Cardiovascular Research Center ( CVRC ) at the MCW . At that time , the Center was the first of its kind in the school , and Dr. Harder again blazed the trails for others to follow in the school . At present several centers in the school are modeled after the CVRC , and during Dr. Harder 's tenure the CVC had gained worldwide reputation as a premier cardiovascular research enterprise . During this period , he made a third seminal discovery where he identified epoxicoicosatrienoic acids ( EETs ) , products of arachidonic acid metabolism were potent inducers of angiogenesis ( Zhang and Harder , 2002 ) . This finding unleashed the potential use of EETs for ischemic related stroke prevention , and has greatly contributed to our understanding of the role of the EETs in the regulation of the vascular reactivity in health and disease ( Campbell et al. , 1996 ; Fisslthaler et al. , 1999 ) . Most , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high impact journals like Nature , Circulation Research and Stroke . From 1999-2004 , he served as the Editor in Chief for the American Journal of Physiology , Heart and Circulation , and chaired the AHA publications committee . He was also elected as fellow in the AHA council for high blood pressure research and council on circulation . His EETs work , especially the analgesic effect finding of 14,15-EETs , has led to the development of anti-pain drugs devoid of addiction ( Terashvili et al. , 2008 ) . He singlehandedly drove the development of this anti-pain drug , which has now cleared Phase I studies in the clinic . This remarkable achievement was done at a time when translational research was not the focus of NIH . It again shows how far ahead Dr. Harder was of his times . Subsequent studies ( Terashvili et al. , 2012 ) from his lab have revealed the translational aspect of his work with direct impact on health outcome . Dr. Harder is an institutional leader whose opinion and time is highly valued . He currently serves as the Associate Dean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mentoring , CTSI at MCW . He takes his mentoring responsibilities seriously and is highly generous with his time . He also wants to disseminate knowledge to others , and help others whenever possible . This is highlighted by the Course in Grant Writing that he directs for CTSI each year . He has instituted several initiatives on campus that have taken one shape or another , and helped many individuals at different levels in the institution . He is highly respected , and regarded , and shows the rare combination of class and brilliance . Finally , we will highlight his latest research that continues to make waves . In the last 2-3 years , Dr. Harder and Dr. Ramani Ramchandran , PhD ( Professor , Pediatrics , Division of Development Biology , Patrick J. and Margaret G. McMahon Chair of Obstetrics and Gynecology , Vice Chair for Research , Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology- MCW ) have interacted at a peer level due to their mutual interests in solving big questions in biology . Dr. Harder introduced Dr. Ramchandran to astrocytes , the glia cell in the brain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Dr. Ramchandran is a vascular biologist by training with deep interest in its application to disease . When Dr. Harder mentioned astrocytes , Dr. Ramchandran was intrigued , and over the course of meetings , they came up with testable ideas . They hypothesized that astrocytes were not reactionary to tumor cells like most believed but rather that they have properties that induce tumor cells to grow , proliferate and migrate to distant sites . Indeed , they had identified that neonatal astrocytes secrete proteins that make breast , lung and sarcoma tumor cells highly metastatic in vivo and in vitro ( Wang et al. , 2013 ) . This work is now beginning to provide glimpses into the biology of metastasis , which was previously unappreciated . Once again , Dr. Harder finds himself in the middle of a novel landmark discovery in biology . Even now , Dr. Harder continues to maintain active NIH funding , and his ability to keep sustained funding for the last 35 plus years of research is truly a feat in itself . <p> Dr. Gupta is an Assistant Professor of Biopharmaceutical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ California .

He was Chief of immunochemistry section at the Department of Humoral Immunity , Japanese NIH during the period of 1988-1991 . He published 127 articles . <p> My research is centered on the immunobiology of severe systemic inflammatory responses to sepsis . The initial immune and inflammatory responses to sepsis , if not treated early , progresses to a late state of immune suppression , which corrolates with elevated mortality . A major focus of my work is to characterize the molecular processes that generate reprogramming of innate immunity cells @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We established that , during sepsis systemic inflammation , epigenetic modifications of histone and remodeling of chromation on specific inflammatory genes reprograms innate immunity cells such as monocytes/macrophages and neutrophils to switch from proinflammatory to immunosuppressive phenotype . These late response events leads to failure to eradicate ongoing infection and increases the risk of secondary , opportunistic infections . Morever , we recently reported that the bone marrow may contribute to innate immunity cell reprogramming during sepsis . We have found that dysregulation of specific microRNAs in the bone marrow disrupt myeloid cell differentiation in septic mice , resulting in the expansion of myeloid-derived suppressor cells-a heterogeneous population of monocyte and neutrophil progenitors and precursors with potent immunosuppressive activities . These findings are significants , since resolution of immune suppression during late sepsis correlates with better survival in septic patients . We reported that reducing the numbers of these suppressor myeloid cells improved survival in late septic mice .

My co-investigators and I have established that tumor-associated T cells are hypo-responsive to activation via the T cell receptor ( TCR ) . We determined that the failure of these cells to respond to activation signals is due to the disruption of the TCR signaling cascade that occurs at or just proximal to the activation of PLC-(gamma) . We have found that an identical TCR signaling arrest occurs in human T cells present within chronic inflammatory tissues . Using human tumor xenograft models my students and postdoctoral fellows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tumor microenvironment activates the quiescent tumor-associated T cells to produce and secrete IFN-(gamma) that mobilizes an immune mediated eradication of the tumor . Based upon these preclinical studies we have begun a Phase I clinical trial to test the safety and feasibility of delivering low and sustained doses of recombinant human IL-12 directly into patients ' tumors . Most recently we have determined that 2 polar lipids ( PS and GD3 ) present within human ovarian tumor ascites fluids mediate a reversible arrest in the TCR signaling pathway of ovarian tumor-associated T cells . A major focus of my laboratory is to structurally characterize the immunoinhibitory lipids present within the tumor ascites fluids , determine the mechanism by which they arrest the TCR signaling , and using a novel humanized mouse model to pre-clinically test whether the TCR signaling arrest can be reversed in tumor-associated T cells or prevented from occurring in T cells upon entry into the tumor microenvironment by eliminating or blocking the lipid mediated disruption of the TCR signaling cascade . <p> Dr. Mimura has received his PhD in Tokyo University during the period of 2001-2005 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tokyo Women 's Medical University .

During critical illness , high stressed states , and increased metabolic demand arginine becomes an essential amino acid . It is during this time that supplementation benefits the host . Arginine supplementation during sepsis , however , has remained controversial as there is theoretical harm stemming from arginine serving as a substrate for nitric oxide production . In this review we discuss the literature both in support of and against the use of arginine in all critically i 'll patients , as well as , advocate for ongoing research to better understand appropriate dosage of arginine in relation to the arginine : asymmetric @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were comprehensively discussed recently by Bennett et al .

Theoretical framework : Nathaniel 's Theory of Moral Reckoning was the grounded theory used to show the application of the improvement interventions . <p> Extubation failure increases morbidity and mortality in intensive care . Laryngeal edema which developed post extubation is one of the major risk factor for extubation failure . Post extubation laryngeal edema occurs in up to 37% @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to prevent development of laryngeal edema . Aim of this study was to find whether steroids can prevent post extubation laryngeal edema and types of patients who frequently fails extubation . <p> A 54-year-old female weighing 62 kg had hemoptysis with an unidentified focus 4 months before and had been followed in the Department of Respiratory Medicine . Angiographic embolization was performed for a right bronchial artery ramification suspected of being the bleeding focus by bronchofiberscopy , but there were few effects . Right middle lobectomy was performed to control the persistent hemoptysis , and tracheal extubation was performed on the second day of illness . Sustained hemoptysis developed again 8 hours after extubation . <p> The decision to transport a critically i 'll patient is based on the need for diagnostic or therapeutic procedures that are not available within the intensive care unit . Most commonly this type of transport is within the home facility and is for procedures such as imaging or for operative intervention . Theoretically , intra-hospital transfers are safer than the transfers to another institution , as transfers outside of the home facility tend to require @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ critically i 'll . <p> The authors report an inadvertent late migration of right jugular catheter and the unexpected complications . Postoperative computed tomography reveals bilateral pleural effusion and pneumomediastinum . We speculate that the migration during the maintenance or multiple attempts of placing a guidewire damaged the wall of right brachiocephalic vein or superior vena cava , and punctured through right pleura and anterior mediastinal leading into the complications . <p> Oxygen delivery after extubation is the cornerstone treatment to maintain adequate oxygenation and avoid reintubation . Oxygen is usually delivered through low-flow nasal prongs ; when necessary , flow is increased or patients are switched to a high-flow face mask . Some other interventions after extubation focus on specific causes of reintubation ; for example , high risk patients are administered prophylactic corticosteroids before planned extubation to prevent laryngeal edema and patients with hypercapnia at extubation are administered noninvasive mechanical ventilation . However , to our knowledge , no other intervention has been proven to reduce reintubation rate in a general population of critically i 'll patients . <p> Klebsiella pneumoniae ( K. pneumoniae ) and Acinetobacter baumannii ( A. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hospitalized in the Intensive Care of our hospital .

From 2012 to the first half of 2014 , 533 patients were admitted to the ICU of our hospital . <p> This is a case-control retrospective analytical study . The cases were patients deceased during hospitalization and controls where those discharged in the same time period . Patients were age-matched and the final outcome of the study was hospital mortality . Rapid Emergency Medicine Score ( REMS ) and Charlson comorbidity index as well as blood analysis ( full blood count , glucose , renal function , ions ) were determined .

No longer is it regarded as a benign panacea for all clinical presentations ; indeed it is now increasingly evident that oxygen has the potential to contribute to clinical deterioration and mortality . There is an emerging recognition that oxygen is a drug when administered as a therapeutic intervention and should be used with caution . Contemporary guidelines offer criteria and directives for administration and prescription of oxygen , dependant on the patient 's condition , acuity and care setting , yet clinical audit and gathering evidence repeatedly demonstrates that poor practice persists . <p> Objective : To review the spectrum of scenarios in which cerebral fat embolism syndrome ( CFES ) may present , the clinical presentation , traditional diagnostic criteria , and current diagnostic technologies . Methods : Three cases are presented representing Classical presentation ( CFES presenting after Intramedullary rods for long bone fractures ) , Atypical presentation ( CFES presenting after long bone fractures without intramedullary rods ) , and Unexpected presentation ( CFES without any long bone fractures ) . All diagnoses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the spectrum of presentations , classical diagnostic criteria , clinical presentations , and use of MRI to confirm diagnosis . <p> In the intensive care unit ( ICU ) physicians are challenged to predict patient outcome when patients are admitted .

In hospitalized patients with alcohol use disorders ( AUD ) , up to 25% will develop acute alcohol withdrawal syndrome ( AWS ) . In critically i 'll patients , presence of AWS is associated with increased duration of mechanical ventilation , prolonged intensive care unit ( ICU ) length of stay ( LOS ) , more frequent infectious complications and higher mortality . <p> Determination of death , the exact moment that a person 's death occurs , has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already know is that death usually does not occur abruptly , at a specific time and for all parts of the body simultaneously . Human resistance to degradation by lack of oxygen varies depending on the type of cell and organ . It is possible , for example , for successful cornea transplants from deceased individuals as many as seven days after death . Actually , the absolute absence of any residual vital activity in the body after cessation of circulatory function can only be confirmed once the putrefaction process is fully established and completely widespread throughout the corpse .

These experiments provide experimental evidence to support these methods and vectors for pre-operative transient gene expression of neuroprotective sequences , such as HSP70 , and also provide the rationale for their use immediately after stroke , or after traumatic brain or spinal cord injury . Biodistribution , toxicity , and multiplex analysis of cytokine responses in serum and CSF from these experiments point to the efficacy , safety , and lack of immune response from these techniques , which should also be of extraordinary interest to pharmaceutical firms looking to deliver and express gene sequences or siRNA to the CNS . <p> Dr. Ike Eriator is a professor of Anesthesiology at the University of Mississippi Medical Center , Jackson , Mississippi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He is also the chair of the Institutional Review Board ( IRB ) , and the evaluation subcommittee of the School of Medicine curriculum committee .

It is the first reported incidence of such a case . Following preoperative assessment and preparation , anaesthesia was induced and the airway secured using direct laryngoscopy and tracheal intubation with a microlaryngoscopy tube ( MLT ) , which was reported uneventful . <p> We report the use of multiple balloon sinus dilation ( BSD ) catheters in the reduction of bilateral anterior table frontal sinus fractures in a 13-year-old male following sports injury . This case is unique in that it displays a less-invasive surgical correction of anterior table frontal sinus fractures using a new surgical tool and follows the literature-supported trend towards sinus preservation . More extensive frontal sinus fractures with severe comminution or displaced posterior table fractures may still deserve open approaches with mini-plating and possible sinus obliteration to assure fracture reduction , fixation , and prevent the risk of intracranial infection . <p> The laryngeal tuberculosis incidence decreased significantly since the development of antituberculosis drugsand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less than 1% of cases of extrathoracic tuberculosis . As tuberculosis is endemic in Morocco , we continue to see this rare localization . Its clinical presentation is atypical and endoscopic aspects are polymorphic , hence the difficulty of diagnostic .

CT/PET scan showed thickening of epiglottis with enhancement after intravenous contrast . Laser resection of epiglottis was done and histopathology revealed moderately differentiated neuroendocrine carcinoma . A week later patient underwent total thyroidectomy with bilateral modified radical neck dissection . Adjuvant external beam radiotherapy to the larynx and neck was given post-operatively . <p> Human papillomavirus ( HPV ) - associated head and neck squamous cell carcinoma ( HNSCC ) is an entity with unique clinical and molecular characteristics , which mainly arises from the palatine tonsils and base of the tongue . Nowadays , oropharyngeal cancers are increasing in incidence despite declining prevalence of smoking and in direct opposition to a decreasing incidence of all other HNSCC . An epidemic of HPV-associated oropharyngeal cancers seems to account for these incidence trends . <p> Background : Revision nasal valve reconstruction is one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ valve dysfunction after primary functional rhinoplasty . Revision nasal surgery is challenging , hampered by the presence of scar tissue , incorporated grafts , and the morbidity of obtaining additional autologous cartilage . Objective : In order to enhance nasal valve function while avoiding revision nasal surgery , a sublabial technique was developed to increase the projection of the piriform margin via allograft augmentation . <p> Rhinitis , a common condition throughout the world , are classified in non-allergic ( NAR ) and allergic rhinitis ( AR ) . The data collected by recent studies show that NAR affects more than 200 million patients world-wide , among which 8% to 10% suffer from NARES and NARESMA . Nevertheless , respiratory diseases , and in particular rhinitis , are not considered real and serious diseases , and , as a result , they remain frequently underdiagnosed and undertreated despite the heavy burden they place on patients , their families and society as a whole . <p> A 73-year-old man , treated with a maxillary subperiosteal implant in 1985 , was referred to our ENT clinic by his dental practitioner due to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discharge . Although the patient had experienced painful recurrent mobilization of the implant from 1995 , he did not approach his dentist until 2006 , when edema and purulent nasal discharge occurred . The radiologic imaging revealed a maxillary sinusitis with severe maxillary bone resorption and an oro-nasal/oro-antral communication , for which the patient underwent removal of the implant , functional endoscopic sinus surgery and repair of the oro-nasal/oro-antral communication with multiple local flaps . <p> In cases of intractable benign paroxysmal positional vertigo ( BPPV ) where conservative management has failed , surgical plugging of the semi-circular canal can provide an effective solution . Where bilateral disease is present , selecting the ear on which to operate can provide a challenge as there is often a pre-existing vestibulopathy and therefore surgery carries a considerable risk of chronic imbalance . <p> Tracheostomy is a surgical procedure in which an incision is made in the anterior part of the neck in order to gain access into the trachea via a stoma .

Myringotomies , tonsillectomies with and without adenoidectomies are commonplace in surgical schedules of hospitals and out-patient surgical centers . <p> The laryngocele is a dilation of the laryngeal saccule filled with air which communicates with the lumen of the larynx . It is pathology , rare but can be serious . Symptoms are varied and diagnosis is based on direct laryngoscopy and scanner . The treatment is purely surgical . We discussed , through three different cases , the clinical , radiological and therapeutic modalities of laryngocele . <p> Our aim is to evaluate transcanal endoscopic approach in repair of subtotal tympanic membrane perforation in a trial to prevent conventional postaural approach . Our study was done in 80 patients with unilateral dry subtotal tympanic perforations . They were 44 males and 36 females . Their ages ranged from 18-50 years with mean of 33 years . Autograft thin ( 0.2 mm ) auricular cartilage shield was used to repair tympanic membrane perforation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approach . <p> Background : An increasing proportion of patients have coexisting upper and lower airway disease . Therefore , the historic perspective of these allergen-induced disorders as distinct and separate entities is being displaced by current thinking that they are better described as a continuum of inflammation involving one common airway . Objectives:The aim of this study was to investigate the role that upper airway inflammation and therapy plays on lower airway situation . Methods:This study was performed on 84 children , aged 4 to 17 years , with asthma with/without rhinitis . Skin prick-test , FeNO ( fractional exhaled nitric oxide ) and nasal cytology were analyzed in all patients ; upper and lower airways symptomatology was assessed by ACT or C-ACT ( Asthma Control Test ; Childhood Asthma Control Test ) and SNOT ( Sino Nasal Outcome Test ) questionnaires . <p> Objectives : To analyze the biological principles of guided bone regeneration and to provide the clinician with information regarding the use of different membranes . Materials and Methods : The choosing criteria among different membranes and the clinical options are presented . Finally , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Guided bone regeneration is one of the several surgical techniques that have been introduced in the last two decades for bone regeneration prior or at the time of implant placement . The rationale of this technique is the positioning of a barrier membrane between the bone and the connective tissue to create a secluded space and to enhance the proliferation of bone forming cells . <p> Glomangiopericytoma , also known as sinonasal hemangiopericytoma , is a rare sinonasal neoplasm that commonly occurs during the sixth or seventh decade of life , often presenting with complaints of nasal congestion and epistaxis . Identified in less than 0.5% of all sinonasal tumors , this typically indolent lesion is a different tumor from the far more common and aggressive so-called soft tissue hemangiopericytoma that arises in varying sites throughout the body . <p> Clinicians are often faced with diagnosing routine oral and maxillofacial pathology . Experience and training make such tasks relatively easy . Establishing differential diagnoses , and ruling out the most unlikely , usually will lead to an appropriate treatment plan . Occasionally , a pathologic presentation may significantly differ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is imperative , when encountering an unknown or unusual lesion , to return to basics and approach the entity with the same systematic work-up approach we were trained to perform since entering residency training programs . <p> The optimal surgical approach for extended parapharyngeal pleomorphic adenomas of the parotid gland is still controversial , also in relation to the possible complications of this type of surgery . We report our experience on 5 patients treated in the last 4 years with the ' extracapsular dissection-endocapsular decompression ' surgical approach for parotid deep lobe extended adenomas . The surgical details are described . No complication in terms of temporary/permanent facial paralysis , sialocele or Frey 's syndrome was noticed . No adenoma recurrence was recorded . <p> The most common presentation of Herpes Zoster infection in the head and neck region is Ramsay Hunt syndrome ( RHS ) .

Herpes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ root ganglia and RHS can be associated with trigeminal , abducent , glossopharyngeal , and vagus nerve , but rarely with hypoglossal nerve . <p> Corresponding author : Reid A. Waldman , University of Missouri-Kansas City School of Medicine , Kansas City , Missouri , USA <p> First described in 1907 by James Ramsay Hunt , an American neurologist , Ramsay Hunt syndrome is the eponym given to a constellation of symptoms including a vesicular rash of the external ear and the ipsilateral two thirds of the tongue with associated paralysis of the seventh cranial nerve . The syndrome , which is also known as herpes zoster oticus and Hunt 's syndrome , is believed to be caused by reactivation of dormant varicella-zoster virus ( VZV ) within the geniculate ganglion and associated sensory nerves . <p> Video Capsule Endoscopy ( VCE ) is an established means of evaluating the upper and lower aerodigestive tracts , with 3 companies now having received FDA clearance for their devices . The most prevalent risk of VCE is capsule retention , which infrequently results in bowel obstruction . In patients suspected of having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capsule is given a few days prior to the VCE procedure to ensure ultimate passage of the VCE device .

Risk factors include immunosuppression , organ transplantation , and diabetes mellitus . Rhinocerebral mucormycosis is the most common presentation in diabetic patients , whereas pulmonary mucormycosis is the most common presentation in patients with hematologic neoplasms . We describe an immunocompromised leukemia patient with painful ecchymotic plaques on the forearm . Punch biopsy demonstrated angioinvasive mucormycosis and culture grew Rhizopus species . In spite of immediate Amphotericin B therapy , amputation was necessary to halt progression of the disease . Early diagnosis and aggressive therapy of mucormycosis in immunocompromised patients is essential . <p> Vancomycin therapy is associated with several hypersensitivity reactions , the most common being the non-immunologically mediated ' red man syndrome ' . Fever , rash , neutropenia , and other manifestations have also been variably associated with a vancomycin hypersensitivity reaction that is likely immunologically mediated . Here we report a 45-year old man who developed diffuse oral aphthous-like ulcers as the most prominent manifestation of vancomycin hypersensitivity reaction . We identified only two previously reported cases of vancomycin hypersensitivity reaction involving oral lesions.

In 2010 adults aged 65 and older made up 73% of hospital deaths compared to 27% for those less than 65 years of age . In 2007 the average Length of Stay ( LOS ) for patients 65 and older was 5.6 days compared to 5.1 days for those 45 to 64 . <p> Climate change is estimated to affect global temperature , leading to an increased number of extreme weather events across the globe .

More specifically , the lab employs pharmaceutical and biochemical approaches to elucidate molecular mechanisms by which the expression and function of genes contributing to lung inflammation and tumorigenesis are altered . One of the key signaling events in environmental factor-induced carcinogenesis is the aberrant alternation of the epigenetic landscape on the genes important for glycolysis , oxidative phosphorylation , self-renewal , and differentiation of the normal cells , adult stem cells , cancer cells , and cancer stem cells . A principal question to be addressed is how extracellular inducers , such as cytokines , ROS and carcinogenic metals , perturb the intracellular regulatory circuits that control cross-talk , durability and potency of a wide spectrum of intracellular signaling pathways . <p> Dr. Hemant Agarwal is a pediatrician in Albuquerque , New Mexico and is affiliated with multiple hospitals in the area , including Jackson-Madison @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ received his medical degree from Seth G.S .

New targeted therapies have recently been introduced to improve progression-free survival in postmenopausal women with estrogen receptor-positive advanced breast cancer . Everolimus is a mammalian target of rapamycin ( mTOR ) inhibitor used in combination with an aromatase inhibitor to treat advanced breast cancer , but may lead to development of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from bisphosphonate therapy . <p> In recent decades , the search for better techniques and materials for the treatment of bone defects in dentistry has been intense . As a result of several studies , many techniques have been described , and a wide variety of filling materials have been suggested to enhance and accelerate bone regeneration . Such materials , known as graft materials , may be obtained from individuals themselves ( autologous ) or from an external source of natural or synthetic origin ( heterogeneous ) , which can be used in the form of blocks or particles . <p> The recurrence rate of 112 cases of Keratocystic Odontogenic Tumor ( KCOT ) were analyzed with regard to their location , size , locularity and treatment . 36 patients ( 32.1% ) presented recurrence . Multilocular KCOT measuring more than 3.5 cm presented higher rate of recurrence . When the initial treatment was enucleation with peripheral ostectomy the recurrence was located in the periphery of the initial tumor . When the treatment was marsupialization followed by enucleation and peripheral ostectomy , the recurrence was located in the periphery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of adjacent teeth . The addition of Carnoy 's solution has slightly reduced recurrence rate . <p> Noonan syndrome is an autosomal dominant condition with variable phenotypic expressions including short stature , distinct craniofacial features , congenital heart anomalies , and developmental delay . The main craniofacial features include hypertelorism with a downward slanting of the palpebral fissures , ptosis , low-set posteriorly rotated ears , deeply grooved philtrum and a high arched palate . <p> Various techniques have been attempted in the past to truly regenerate the lost bone structures . Owing to its stimulatory effect on angiogenesis and epithelialization , concentrated growth factor ( CGF ) is an excellent material for enhancing bone healing . The purpose of these case series is to document the beneficial role of CGF in the healing of different bone defect areas . This report describes four female patients presented with ( lateral cyst on tooth 22 ; periimplantitis on mandibular left first premolar area ; furcation lesion on tooth 36 , periapical abcess on teeth 11-21 ) . Mucoperiosteal full-thickness flaps were elevated to perform the surgical debridement of lesion areas in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because it can reduce treatment time , number of surgeries and post-extraction bone loss . Following tooth extraction , socket area shows series of physiologic processes , during the recovery time that passes between tooth extraction and the placement of the implant , the majority of the amount of bone resorption and gingival remodeling is confirmed , which is usually the cause of biological , aesthetic and functional damage . <p> A self-administered questionnaire was answered by 261 fixed orthodontic patients . The questionnaire addressed two aspects : socio-demographic characteristics and oral hygiene practices . Socio-demographic variables included age , gender , race , level of education , and smoking status . Oral hygiene practices were assessed through questions on the type and frequency use of toothbrush , other cleaning measures used daily and professional mechanical tooth cleaning ( PMTC ) during the orthodontic treatment period . The data were analysed descriptively using SPSS version 22.

There are many causes for urinary incontinence and among the elderly with dementia , the problem is often not related to abnormalities of the lower urinary tract . <p> As laparoscopic surgery becomes more widespread , understanding the adverse effects of pneumoperitoneum becomes more important , especially in patients subjected to laparoscopic unilateral nephrectomy . The purpose of the current study was to investigate the effect of pneumoperitoneum on the remnant kidney after laparoscopic nephrectomy compared to open surgery . <p> Orchitis are classified as granulomatous and non-granulomatous orchitis . Several agents are responsible for inflammatory and infective diseases of the testis , causing orchitis . The most common clinical features are scrotal swelling , mass and/or pain . The diagnosis is mainly histological because clinical and sonographic aspects may be not conclusive . <p> Ureterocele is swelling in one of the ureters that carry urine from the kidney to the bladder , which can block urine flow . An ureterocele usually occurs in the lower part of the ureter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equally common in both left- and right-side ureters . Some persons with ureteroceles are asymptomatic . Often , the diagnosis is made later in life due to kidney stones . <p> Aspermia is the complete lack of semen with ejaculation , which is associated with infertility . Many different causes were reported such as infection , congenital disorder , medication , retrograde ejaculation , iatrogenic aspemia , and so on . The main treatments based on these etiologies include anti-infection . <p> Hyperbaric oxygen ( HBO ) therapy is a supplemental treatment , in addition to the converntional approach , for patients with an underlying ischemic process . In Andrology , HBO is a therapeutic approach supplemental to surgical and medical options for some patients , mainly reported in the treatment of perineal necrotizing fasciitis ( Fournier 's gangrene ) . There were also case reports of successful management using the HBO therapy for posttraumatic ischemic injury , infertility caused by varicocele , hydrocele , testicular torsion , and erectile dysfunction . <p> A 73-year-old man with almost no previous medical history was admitted acute with stomach pain , distended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patient had been constipated for three months and about a month before admission , a coloscopy was performed presenting no findings . Computed Tomography ( CT ) showed mechanical bowel obstruction and a huge malignantly transformed prostate gland as the triggering cause . <p> Corresponding author : Athanasios Godelitsas , School of Science , National and Kapodistrian University of Athens , Zografou Campus , 15784 , Athens , Greece <p> Kidney stone disease ( urolithiasis ) is a serious health problem , involving more than 5% of the population , especially in developing countries . Urolithiasis , the formation of urinary calculi in the kidney , bladder and/or urethra , can be attributed to several risk factors related to geographical region , gender and dietary habits . <p> Objective : To clarify a possible role of prostatic trace elements in an etiology of age-dependent gland diseases such as benign prostatic hyperplasia and prostate cancer . Methods : The variation with age of the 54 trace elements concentration in prostatic parenchyma and the relationship of these trace elements with basic histological structures of nonhyperplastic prostate glands of 65 subjects aged 21-87 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry and a quantitative morphometric analysis . <p> Prostate cancer ( PCa ) is the most common malignancy among men in the United States of America ( USA ) . Tissue samples should be taken from different parts of prostate by transrectal ultrasound guided prostate needle biopsy ( TPND ) and these samples should be examined histopathologically for the diagnosis of PCa . In recent years , the serum prostate specific antigen ( PSA ) measurement and number of prostate biopsies performed have become more frequent . <p> Percutaneous nephrolithotomy ( PCNL ) via upper-pole access can be achieved either supracostally and subcostally . The supracostal access is associated with a higher rate of pulmonary complication . We studied the factors , which predict the pulmonary complication following upper pole access PCNL and postoperative outcomes of patients with pulmonary complication . <p> A 39-year-old primigravida female presented at 16 weeks gestation , with new onset of severe abdominal pain with nausea and vomiting . Her medical history was significant for infertility and ovarian endometrioma during oocyte retrieval . Current gestation was complicated by an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first trimester .

Artificial penile implant are inert objects inserted beneath the skin of the penis . Objects placed under the skin of the penile shaft may include plastic beads made from toothbrushes , silicon , metal pellets , glass , ivory , precious metals , marbles or pearls . Some men believe that penile implants enhance the sexual pleasure . Subdermal implants placed under the skin of the penis can provide physical stimulation for both sexual partners . <p> Urethral stricture disease is a complex urologic problem with multiple etiologies and multiple surgical approaches . Although there is no one single technique employed for all types of strictures , buccal mucosal graft urethroplasty ( BMU ) has proven to be a versatile surgical option for the reconstructive urologist since its first use in the 1940s . Although there are multiple large , single-center experiences with buccal urethroplasty , only recently have short and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a paucity of literature regarding the long-term reconstructive outcomes in patients that have failed previous open reconstructive attempts . <p> Ectopic ureters draining into a place other than the posterior-lateral aspect of the trigone is uncommon . Patients may be asymptomatic or present with the classic symptoms of normal voiding associated with continuous urinary leakage . We present a case of an adult female whose ureteric duplication was unmasked after insertion of tension free vaginal tape ( TVT ) . <p> Arterio-ureteral fistula is an uncommon diagnosis with a high rate of mortality . An early diagnosis is the key for a successful treatment and should be included in the differential diagnosis of patients with unexplained hematuria . We report a clinical case and a review of the literature . <p> Background : Due to advances in cancer diagnosis and treatment , the number of prostate cancer survivors is increasing .
