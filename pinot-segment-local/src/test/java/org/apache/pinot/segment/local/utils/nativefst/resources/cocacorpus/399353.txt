@@59422095 @8422095/ <p> Lines are open 8.30am - 5pm Monday to Friday - Note calls may be recorded <p> What are the SME Lending Regulations ? <p> In December 2015 , the Central Bank of Ireland published a revised Regulation for Business Lending to Small and Medium Enterprises called the SME Regulations . The SME Regulations set out new requirements for lenders when dealing with SMEs who are facing or in financial difficulty . This code was effective from 01 July 2016 . <p> The objectives of the regulations are : <p> To facilitate access to credit for sustainable and productive business propositions <p> To promote fairness and transparency in the treatment of small and medium enterprises <p> To ensure that when dealing with financial difficulties cases , the aim of a regulated entity will be to <p> Assist borrowers to meet their obligations , or otherwise deal with the situation in an orderly and <p> Initially , problems may not seem that serious . Sales may be slightly down or the cash coming into the business may not quite meet the outgoings . <p> The business carries on as normal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sales figures will improve . However , if figures do n't improve , the business could find itself inundated with demands from suppliers and it may be difficult to pay staff . <p> If the problems are n't resolved then the result can be insolvency . The key is to be pro-active with measures that will put your business back on an even keel . <p> What should I do ? By spotting the early warning signs , you will be in a much stronger position to put things right . <p> If the time-delay between the raising of an invoice and the customer paying is causing cashflow problems , there are a number of possible solutions . These include : <p> Focus on winning business that will generate cash quickly . Tighten credit control . Make sure invoices are sent out on time . Chase payment when it becomes due . Consider factoring or invoice discounting arrangements , where cash is lent to you by the bank as soon as an invoice is raised . Keep track of the financial health of your customers and suppliers . Change payment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ improving , then you should consider other measures such as selling assets , cutting staff and reducing costs and/or inventory in order to free up cash . <p> Talking to your bank Make the time to regularly talk to your bank . For instance , if your problems are caused by a lack of available finance due to overly rapid growth , a bank is more likely to provide the funds if the problem is identified early and brought to its attention . <p> If your financial situation threatens your ability to meet existing repayment obligations , banks are more likely to be sympathetic if you talk to them early and present a credible business plan . <p> The one thing you should never do is trade while insolvent . If the company runs out of cash , then it is illegal to take orders from customers or take goods on credit from suppliers . There are serious penalties for breaking this rule . <p> If the company runs out of cash , then it is illegal to take orders from customers or take goods on credit from suppliers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ However , the definition of insolvency is complex and it 's not always easy to know when you 've crossed the line . If in doubt , seek advice from your lawyer or accountant . If you are insolvent , the next step may be administration . <p> Administration and involuntary arrangements Administration occurs when a company 's financial difficulties prompt creditors , stakeholders , or sometimes the directors themselves , to apply for a court order to begin the process . <p> While it sounds drastic , administration need n't be the end of the road . Under the recently enacted Enterprise Act , the accountants who take over the running of a company in administration have a duty to do all they can to return the business to operational health . <p> A variation on the theme is administrative receivership . This occurs when a creditor or lender has a claim on the company 's assets to cover non-payment . In these cases the role of the receiver is to recover assets for that particular creditor . <p> One useful means of getting through a period of crisis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Company Voluntary Arrangement ( CVA ) . Under these agreements , creditors and the company agree a legally enforceable recovery plan . Once a CVA is in place , creditors ca n't sue for repayment for an agreed period of time and the company has time to recover . <p> Similarly , sole traders with debts of less than -5000 can apply for an administration order , which will allow them to pay the courts an agreed monthly sum that will be divided among creditors .

Perhaps you 're looking for a job where you 'll be able to prove yourself an expert in something ? <p> Figuring out what 's most important to you when it comes to work is n't always easy , and that 's where career drivers come in . <h> What are Career Drivers ? <p> Simply put , career drivers are a tool to discover what you enjoy in a job . They can help you make informed choices based on this information , so you find a career that 's a good fit for you . As well as this , they can also teach you to play on your strengths in your current role . <p> This way , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what you do at work , contributing to over-all job satisfaction ( and you 'll have a happy employer too ! ) . <p> Online , there 's a wealth of questionnaires , quizzes and articles to try and help you figure out what your career drivers are . We 've decided to take some of the work out for you , and narrow down the things you need to know about identifying them , so you can use them to your advantage . <p> Below are ten common career drivers , have a read and find yours . <h> 1 . The Experts <p> You 're driven by the need to become a real expert in your field . You want to develop your abilities further in a subject , rather than across a wider scope of many subjects . You prefer the idea of specialising in a chosen field , putting you in an excellent position where only you ( and perhaps a select few ) can do the role . <h> 2 . The Creatives <p> You seek a job where you can stretch your creative muscles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind . You have a great imagination , and can bring new and fresh ideas to the table " and you really enjoy doing so . <h> 3 . The Helpers <p> The Helpers are those who really want to make a difference with their work . You search for deeper meanings in your career , looking for jobs where you can have a tangible , positive impact in some way . <h> 4 . The Influencers <p> You like to take a steady control of situations , and you enjoy having an input on big decisions in the workplace . Seeing the positive results of your judgements and actions on others inspires you , and you enjoy guiding and motivating people . <h> 5 . The Organisers <p> You 're good at keeping things in order , and you love doing so . You like planning , and you think things through thoroughly to obtain great results in your work . You feel rewarded by seeing your hard work and efforts being used to positive effect . <h> 6 . The Reward seekers <p> You seek financial return as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard , and receive a good reward and recognition for your efforts . You 're happy to take on big challenges to do this , because you know the results are going to be worth it . <h> 7 . The Socialisers <p> Having a strong team environment or social aspect to work is important to you . You love working with people , and you seek jobs where you 're able to do this everyday . Whether it 's customer or colleague relationships , you thrive on social interactions to really enjoy your work . <h> 8 . The Securers <p> Job security is key for you . You look for a career that 's in high demand within the industry . You want to make sure you 'll always have a steady income , that your role is protected , and that it carries little risk . <h> 9 . The Autonomy Seekers <p> You prefer an independent approach to work , and feel it 's important you 're able to make your own decisions and have a good work/life balance . This could include choosing your working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ workload . You seek a role where your employer is flexible and adaptable to your needs . <h> 10 . The Actives <p> You need to be constantly moving , whether physically or mentally , and you 'd love a job with regular travel , varied workloads , or lots of interactions with new people . You seek excitement in your career , where you 're always moving in some shape or form . <h> How to use your career drivers <p> We recommend using two to three of these drivers , however if you feel there are more that apply to you , consider these too . After deciding what yours are , you can research roles , or qualifications and skills you 'll need to obtain , which will allow you to meet your ambitions . <p> Ask others for their opinions too , they 'll probably have their own ideas of what you should try , the more ideas the better ! <p> Michael for example , finds he falls under The Helpers ' , The Socialisers ' and The Actives ' . He wants a role @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lots of interactions , in a fast-paced and varied environment " so he 's narrowed it down to a call centre customer service role . In this type of work , he 's able to meet his needs for regular socialising , whilst being able to speak to a lot of new people in a busy environment , and ultimately help customers . This keeps him regularly motivated at work , because he genuinely enjoys what he does . <p> Another example would be Zoe . She has found she falls under The Creatives ' The Influencers ' and The Organisers ' . She 's concluded that she 'd be suitable for a project manager role . She wants to be able to use her teamwork and influencing skills to drive positive change , whilst having a creative say in her work . <p> The great thing about doing this type of task , is that you can discover drivers and passions you did n't even realise you had . You get to know what you like at work better , and you also get to know yourself better . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's time to go and get there .

@@59422144 @8422144/ <h> 6 ways a mentor could help your career , and how to choose the right person <p> When we spoke to our Head of Commercial Credit Chris Green about improving gender balance in our senior roles , he talked about how important having a mentor can be to your career . We think it 's great advice . A mentor can be a real positive no matter what stage of your career you 're at , or how senior your role is . However we know from experience that it is n't always an easy thing to make a start with . How do you know whether it 's really right for you ? If it is , how do find the right mentor ? And once you start , how do you make the arrangement work ? <p> To help you work out the answers to these questions and more , we 've decided to shine the spotlight on mentoring in a short series of articles . You 'll find suggestions and advice on everything from what to think about before you start , to how to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We 'll also speak to some of our people , and find out how they make the most of their mentoring relationships . <p> For now we 're going to start at the beginning , with a few ways that mentoring could help you in your career . <h> 1 ) By giving you the chance to work with a role model <p> If you feel that you know the kind of role you 're looking for , then having a mentor who 's either already in or who 's been in that position before could be really useful to helping you get there . They 'll quickly understand the career challenges you 'll face , and may well have direct experience of the same kind of obstacles themselves . They 're also in the ideal position to help figure out what the most important skills are to take you where you want to go , and how you can develop them . <p> A role model mentor could also be a great way to get specific support on a more short-term basis , such as a project which stretches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <h> 2 ) By helping you to understand and focus on what it is you want <p> People who know what they want to do are n't the only ones who can benefit from having a mentor . It 's easy to get stuck climbing the ladder you 're on when you do n't really want , or to feel at a loss as to how to make your next move . A good mentor will have your best interests in mind , and will help you to reflect on what you 're good at and the kind of work you enjoy . They can also help you make a plan to get more of the things you enjoy into your working life , give you the confidence to make changes , and help keep you on track . <h> 3 ) By letting you benefit from someone else 's mistakes and successes <p> We all know the importance of learning from mistakes , but what if those mistakes do n't have to be your own ? You could save yourself a lot of time and pain . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when they 've faced up to similar challenges , sharing what worked and what did n't . More importantly they 're likely to have reflected on why they got the outcome they did , and rather than simply giving you a formula to follow , they can make suggestions about what you should consider when you plan your own approach . <h> 4 ) By holding you to account <p> There 's no easier promise to break than the ones we make to ourselves " just look at the history of broken New Year resolutions for proof . Make those commitments to somebody else though , and the incentive to follow through on what you say you 'll do becomes a lot greater . <p> Even if you 're the kind of person who makes a point of always seeing the tasks you set yourself through to the end , your mentor could challenge you to set your standards higher and to stretch yourself . <h> 5 ) By giving you both positive and constructive feedback <p> It is n't always easy to get an accurate beat on how well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're in the middle of it . Maybe your feelings of discomfort are making it seem like everything 's going wrong . Or maybe you have a blindspot to how you 're affecting the people around you , or there 's an angle you simply have n't considered . <p> If you simply need to vent , talk to a friend or family member . A mentor should be honest , objective and far enough from the situation to both help you see the things you 're doing well , and recognise where you can improve . They may be able to see your problems from a different perspective , and help you widen your own so that you come up with better solutions . <h> 6 ) By letting you access a wider network <p> We do n't recommend making this your primary motivation in approaching a potential mentor " if you 're only in it for who the person knows , there 's a chance they may feel like you 're using them . But if both parties agree it 's a good idea , your mentor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be useful to know . <p> That might simply be about improving your profile . Alternatively , it could be to give you another source on advice on a problem you 're facing , or even put you in front of someone who can have a direct influence on the problem itself . <h> How do you choose a mentor ? <p> Hopefully you have a clearer picture of how mentoring could help you get more out of your career and move it forward . Why not take some time to think about how a mentor could benefit you , and whether it 's something you want to pursue ? <p> If you decide that to give it a go , here are three things to bear in mind when choosing the right person . <h> 1 ) Trust is key <p> Your mentoring meetings should be a safe place where you can be honest about the challenges you 're facing . You 'll need to know you can trust your mentor so that you can be open about the things that concern you , while knowing that your conversations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : consider it the foundation of a good mentoring relationship . <h> 2 ) Make it someone you admire <p> A mentor should be someone whose advice and talent you respect . Even if they are n't a direct role model , they should be someone who inspires you to be better , and demonstrates the kind of skills and behaviours you look up to . <p> That does n't necessarily mean they have to be very senior , or even at a level more senior than you . If you believe their advice and reflections would be valuable to you , or that they can help you improve your skills , then they may make a good mentor. <h> 3 ) Shop around <p> Commitment is essential to a good mentoring relationship , but that does n't mean you 're locked into the first person you approach . Try meeting with a number of people to find out if you connect , especially if you do n't have much of a relationship with them already . The way you interact personally will be as important as their experiences in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and do n't be afraid to be honest if it is n't working . Telling somebody that you want to look elsewhere may feel awkward in the short term , but you 'll both lose a lot more by continuing a poor arrangement . <h> Careers in Ulster Bank <p> If you want to join an organisation where your colleagues will help you to drive your career development , take a look at our current opportunities

Never respond to any unexpected or suspicious emails - and do n't click on any attachments within such emails . <p> Phishing typically happens when criminals send convincing looking but fraudulent emails , although they have also been known to use phone contact . <p> These emails are often sent to thousands of individuals - in the hope that some will be hoodwinked into supplying personal information . This may include user names , email addresses , passwords , bank account , and credit card details . <h> Look out for phishing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's not in the normal style of an email from a legitimate company . <p> Familiar language or tone but poor grammar and spelling . <p> ' Verify your account ' request - banks will never ask you to enter full account details , passwords or PINs onto a website . <p> ' There is a secure message waiting for you ' - these messages work by putting the emphasis on reading a message - not your actual account . However , the link in the email will still ask for your personal account details . <p> ' If you do n't respond within 48 hours , your account will be closed ' - such messages convey a sense of urgency that can make you respond immediately without thinking . Phishing emails might even claim that your response is required because your account may have been compromised . <p> ' Click the link below to gain access to your account ' - sophisticated email messages can contain links or forms that you may fill out just as you would do on a legitimate website . <p> ' Dear valued customer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and often do not contain your first name or surname . <h> Telephone scams ( voice phishing ) <p> Some fraudsters target people with unsolicited phone calls pretending to be from the bank or even the police . This type of fraud is often called ' voice phishing ' or ' vishing ' . <p> Often they will encourage you to part with security information as part of an ongoing investigation into potential fraud , or claiming that they need to verify security information following a recent transaction . This can include requesting you to hand over cards or PIN details to third party couriers . <p> Sometimes you might get a " warm-up call " where no information is discussed , but your guard is lowered when you get a subsequent call , which refers back to the initial seemingly innocent call you received . <p> Example : <p> Call 1 - " This is the Bank/Police .

Before we can do this I just need you to provide your online banking log in and characters 134 of your PIN and 268 of your Password " - the transaction is confirmed as fraudulent with the customer at which point the customer is given instructions to provide a card reader code to obtain a refund . " <h> Call Spoofing <p> Some fraudsters use technology to enable them to display a legitimate number when making fraudulent calls . This tactic is used as an additional tool to convince those who are targets of fraud that a call is genuine . <p> Therefore if you receive an unexpected call purporting to be from the bank , do n't automatically assume it 's genuine - if you have any suspicions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) .

Remember , we will never call and ask you to disclose these security details . <p> If you receive a suspicious or unexpected call , always verify the caller using an independently checked telephone number , for example by contacting your branch or using the contact numbers on our website . <p> Be aware that fraudsters often use techniques to hold your phone line open , so that when you try to dial out to verify the caller , they intercept and re-answer the call , claiming to be the Bank or Law Enforcement . To ensure that your phone has not been compromised , we recommend using a different phone line to verify the caller ( where possible ) . Where a second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or friend on the line first , as the fraudster will find it difficult to impersonate a voice that is known to you . <h> Text messaging scams ( SMS phishing ) <p> As mobile phones become capable of helping you manage your money online , you need to take care to guard yourself against fraudsters . <h> What is SMS phishing ? <p> SMS phishing ( sometimes referred to as ' Smishing ' ) is when people are targeted by fraudsters via text message to try and obtain personal information by impersonating as a trustworthy source . <p> Some people may receive text messages pretending to be from their bank . They may state that sensitive information about you has been posted on the internet and encourage you to visit a web site . These messages are fraudulent - visiting the link in the text could result in an attempt to infect your computer or handheld device with a virus . <p> Other messages state there is a problem with your bank account and encourage you to phone a number . These are also fraudulent , trying to trick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Example text messages : <p> " Your account is closed due to unusual activity .

@@59422340 @8422340/ <h> The Greener Side of Banking- A conversation with Ulster Bank 's Agriculture Manager <p> Farming plays a huge role in our economy , and with a growing population and Brexit on the horizon , interesting and equally challenging times lie ahead from an economic , environmental and financial perspective . Ulster Bank understands how valuable farmers are , and we 're passionate about equipping our people with relevant agriculture knowledge to ensure they understand their clients ' needs and the financial requirements of their farm . <p> Dr Anne-Marie Butler , our Agriculture Manager , combines the perfect blend of farming and banking expertise . An ambassador for our agriculture sector , she understands the importance of educating her peers in the industry . Anne-Marie spends a great deal of time visiting client farms across the country , getting to know our farmers , their holdings and their individual financial requirements . <p> Hi Anne-Marie , thanks for talking to us today . Can you tell me how you came to be Ulster Bank 's Agriculture Manager ? <p> I grew up on a tillage farm in Co @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ science subjects at school . I wanted to progress in both areas and the Degree programme in Agricultural Science at University College Dublin offered that pathway . I subsequently completed an undergraduate degree in Agri Business &amp; Rural Development and a PhD in Agriculture from University College Dublin . Following my PhD completion , I was employed as the Farm Business lecturer in UCD for both undergraduate and postgraduate students . While I enjoyed lecturing and the student interaction , I was delighted to join Ulster Bank in 2008 as Agricultural Manager as it offered a wonderful blend of agriculture , finance and customer interaction . <p> Do you spend a lot of time on the various farms we 're involved with ? <p> My remit covers the whole of the Republic of Ireland , all 26 counties , so I 'm on the road about three or four days a week . I typically spend about two of those visiting our farming clients and their businesses . Farmers are busy and work long hours , especially at spring or harvest time . Farmers appreciate their bank visiting them to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opportunities . People are far more relaxed and comfortable within their own surrounds and this allows for more productive , informed conversation , particularly if the farm family are experiencing financial difficulties or stress . <p> Having a banker visit your farm to discuss and understand grass quality , achieved yields , milk constituents and animal gain to name just a few key metrics , gives the customer confidence to bank with us . Understanding their circumstances , requirements and evolving needs allows us to offer the appropriate products and services for their ever changing business . <p> Equally as important , farm visits and stakeholder meetings provide me with a fantastic insight into sector developments and emerging trends . As a bank , we can therefore respond accordingly to identified opportunities or potential risks . The agricultural market is constantly changing and as Agriculture Manager , I need to understand and communicate those insights to determine solutions and appropriate responses . <p> So , when you 're not on the farm ? <p> A significant part of my role is to provide support to all front line staff with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This can range from existing customers , to new bank cases and customers experiencing financial difficulties . I provide technical and scientific input while also evaluating the financial viability of the proposal . <p> My job involves a lot of communication with both internal and external parties . When I 'm not advising on agricultural lending , I 'm visiting key stakeholders , intermediaries and research agencies to promote Ulster Bank . This interaction allows insight for new product development and an enhanced customer experience . <p> Our aim is not to be the biggest bank , but to be the bank offering the best relationships and customer journeys . It 's really important that we get to know our customers , their land , their farms and their ambitions . We want our customers to trust us and feel comfortable and confident that we understand their businesses and financial requirements . <p> It 's great that Ulster Bank employees have embraced agri education and want to gain a greater understanding of the industry . In 2013 , Ulster Bank launched the Agri Accreditation programme which is accredited by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ members have completed the training which comprises online modules , site visits , guest lectures and days working with customers at their farms . I was the coordinator of the programme and very much enjoyed the staff interaction and feedback . The module was shortlisted in 2016 for the Irish Institute of Training and Development Awards . While not victorious on awards night , it was a tremendous experience with stiff competition . <p> As a development from the Agri Accreditation module , the Irish Institute of Bankers approached Ulster Bank to build upon the accreditation programme and develop a new agri training course for employees across the Irish financial services industry ( a Professional Diploma in SME Credit " SME Agri Credit Assessment &amp; Financing ) . I was responsible for the development of this new course and very much enjoyed the experience . The module , webinars , lectures and reading material is now complete . Registrations are on-going with the first exam available in May 2017 . <p> I often return to UCD and Teagasc ( the national agri research agency ) to deliver guest lectures in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learning . I enjoy these lecturing invitations as it offers great insight into student perceptions , ideas and banking experiences . <p> Consequently it 's going to be a challenging and unpredictable period . We therefore need to understand the potential outcomes and be cautious in our analyses . By developing and coaching our people , we 're in a much better position to serve our customers across all farm sectors . <p> Well , congratulations , it 's an amazing achievement ! <p> Thank you ! I also enjoy and value continuous education for myself . I recently won the President 's Prize for the Professional Diploma in Financial Services at the Irish Institute of Bankers graduation ceremony . The President 's Prize is awarded for the highest results in the programme . <p> Agriculture is perhaps traditionally thought of as a male dominated sector - has that ever been apparent at work ? <p> No , I ca n't say that it has . Thinking back to my degree , the course consisted of maybe 60% males , 40% females in a class of 180 students . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 50/50 . Being a female in this profession has never caused any obstacles for me . Farmers value a banker that understands their farm and sector irrespective of sex , especially one that 's taken the time to visit the holding . <p> Gender is n't really an issue in farming these days . The big concern is the age profile of the farming population . Less than 6% of farmers are under 35 and the average age is around 59 . It 's more of a focus to get the next generation attracted to a career in farming and ensure there is an adequate labour supply to service these farms . <p> What are your other focus areas for 2017 ? <p> I 'll continue to drive awareness of the Ulster Bank brand in the sector and I 'll also work to strengthen our relationships with key intermediaries across the industry to embed the Ulster Bank brand and messaging . Agri training and staff development will also continue to be an area of focus . <p> I look forward to plenty more meaningful conversations with customers , and of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
