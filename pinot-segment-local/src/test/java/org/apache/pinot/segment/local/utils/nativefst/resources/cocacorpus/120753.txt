IPod : <p> Let 's go back in time and have a look at the cassette walkman , a single cassette could barely have 12 to 15 songs in it . Music lovers were always seen buying and keeping various cassettes with them . But , that was that and this is now , this magnificent white device which revolutionized the music industry and has the capacity to store up to 30,000 songs in it.No doubt , IPods have made our lives very easy as far as music is concerned . <h> 22 . Fridge : <p> First introduced in 1927 , refrigerators are without a doubt the greatest kitchen invention ever made .

Using these black and white stripes we can easily recognize the price of the item and in addition to that it also helps to keep a track of our inventory.Boring or not , Bar Codes have changed the way we shop . <h> 18 . Radio : <p> The Radio is an important part of our lives , whether it be listening to news or just driving around town in your car listening to music . The first Radio was invented in 1901 , when the Italian Guglielmo Macroni sent the first radio transaction . The technology was the most important means of communication in the old days particularly during the World War era.Had radio not been invented , then , life as we know it would n't even exist . <h> 17 . Printing Press : <p> Today the evolved version of this device is termed as a printer . The device was originally invented in 1454 by a German Goldsmith by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which using ink , could print repeatedly on paper .

Gaming Consoles : <p> Ok so let 's look at the way we entertain ourselves indoor in this modern era . We have come a long way from the Pong invented in 1972 . Whether you like to stay fit or just love having fun , gaming consoles are for everyone , if you want to stay fit you can play the Nintendo Wii or if your into violence you can play first person shooters.A world without gaming is a world in which I do not desire to live and Gaming consoles take gaming to the next level . <h> 15 . Guns : <p> Every picture has its own perception ; some people find guns to be an amazing invention while others consider it to be the work of Satan . Good or bad , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world in which we live , now everyone does n't have to learn to fight with swords to protect themselves , true that a person needs to train with guns as well but it 's much easier then the sword fighting.The first gun was fired in the 13th century and since then , it has all been uphill as far as the development of guns is concerned . <h> 14 . ATM : <p> Automated Teller Machine or more commonly referred to as ATM , this invention is amongst the most important inventions ever made . Invented by J.S.Barron , the first ATM was introduced at Barclays Bank in June 1967 . If you run out money and you have limited time to spend , then , instead of waiting for your turn in a bank , simply go to an ATM machine and draw out money.Life without ATM 's truly would be difficult . <h> 13 . Telephone : <p> Some men are born great while others have greatness trust upon them , same can be said for Alexander Graham .

With over 1.3 billion phone lines currently in use throughout the world , the Modern telephone network is the backbone of all sorts of communication being done today . <h> 12 . Digital Camera : <p> When you think of camera 's a few big names are Canon , Sony and Kodak . Though Canon is widely recognized as the creators of the best cameras in the world , it is a shock knowing that the credit to this invention goes to Kodak and not Canon . A Kodak engineer by the name of Steven Sasson invented the first digital camera in 1975 . Since then , this technology has evolved our lives greatly . Without Digital Camera 's half the breakthroughs in science would not have been possible as there would have been no means to go into the depths of this world which are not visible to the human eye.This technology is the sole reason for most of today 's breakthroughs in science . <h> 11 . Television : <p> The Television of more commonly referred to as the TV @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not only giving exposure to as seen on tv products but endless entertainment and educational choices as well .

Robots : <p> Imagine a life of hard work , where you do n't have any machines to help you . Let 's consider building a Pyramid without machines , it would take years and thousands and thousands of men to complete it . But , fortunately for us , we have developed assistants in almost every walk of life . These assistants are computerized machines , programmed to do specific tasks of work more efficiently than humans . The use of Drones , the various car productions methods and even the assembling and disassembling of machines is done efficiently due to robots.The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a time may come in future where Robots will do all the work and we will have all sorts of spare time to ourselves . <h> 9 . Mobile Phones : <p> They say seeing is believing , seeing a mobile phone in the hand of every human being who has any sense of himself is becoming more and more common . Today there are over 5 billion mobile phones in use and the number keeps on increasing . The ability to communicate with others even from the remotest location is all being made possible due to mobile phones and satellite phones are the perfect example of it. - The ability to stay in touch all the time via text messages is very common among the youth and is perhaps the most widely used means of communicating used today.With the development of this technology , there is no doubt that everyone has a mobile and everyone needs a mobile . <h> 8 . Steam Engine : <p> Overshadowed by electrical and internal combustion engines , the Steam engine is perhaps the most unappreciated invention used today . The enormous changes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the use of Steam engine and it shows the importance of Steam Engines in practical life.Though electrical engines get more preference and acknowledgement ; Steam Engines are used by majority of the power plants to generate electricity . <h> 7 . Automobiles : <p> There can be little doubt about the importance of Automobiles in our lives . An interesting fact is that here are 600 million passenger cars used in the world right now . We can add to it the fact that people also travel by means of public transport such as trains , but , our result of 600 million indicates that there is roughly one car per 11 people.Just think about how life would be without automobiles. <h> 6 . Aircrafts : <p> A name which everyone has heard is that of the Wright Brothers , who in 1902 developed the first form of an aircraft which was a three-axis control system . The possibility to fly over 9000 kilometers in 8 hours is nothing but remarkable . But , this ability to fly and touch the sky could not have been made possible had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not been invented , we would still be sailing the oceans to reach our destination . <h> 5 . Email : <p> Before the invention of Email , a person would send a document and wait for days for the person to receive it . Today Email 's have revolutionized our lives . A person sitting in one part of the world can communicate with someone in any other part of the world in the time of a few seconds.With the development and adaption of this technology , life has become very easy and comfortable . <h> 4 . Internet : <p> 25 percent of the world that is 1.7 billion people are using internet today . In the 1960s American defense used a service called ARPANET as a means of the internet and later joined hands with the National Science Foundation to evolve internet . But the internet we know today under World Wide Web was created by Tim Berner Lee in 1989 . Our life has been made extremely easy all thanks to the internet and the means of communication through social networking sites keeps usin continuous contact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world . <h> 3 . Computers : <p> Computers have impacted our lives with numerous benefits . Whether it be landing on the moon or just every day to day business transactions , nothing is possible without computers . Computers are now used in almost every phase of life and there is hardly any area where computer has n't benefited the humans . Bringing speed and more reliability with them , computers can do numerous mathematical calculations with incredible speed and pin point accuracy.Add to that the fact that new software 's and hardware 's are always making the computer better , life without a computer is like a rose without petals . <h> 2 . Light Bulb : <p> Thought Thomas Edison gets most of the credit for the invention of the light bulb , this invention was the collective work of Thomas Edison and Joseph Swan . Eventually the two joined hands and launched a company called Ediswan . So if you 're somewhere where there is light at night , then be thankful to Thomas Edison and Joseph Swan . Imagine a world where you have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in your room , life truly would be miserable but fortunately for us we had Ediswan.The bulb itself works by transmitting electricity through a filament . <h> 1 . Electricity : <p> Probably the single most important invention in human history , without electricity humans have nothing . Without electricity there is no TV , no computer , no internet and certainly no light bulb . Had it not been for Electricitywe would n't even have a list of the top 30 inventions we would have a minor list of 3 or 5 inventions . 5901 @qwx625901 5903 @qwx625903 <p> Really ?

@@73219892 @1919892/ <h> The Challenges of Designing and Development <p> Every industry is challenging however , designers and developers have to face a little more trouble because their industry is constantly evolving . Designers and developers are facing a lot of challenges every now and then . Today , we will be discussing the challenges faced by both , a designer and a developer . <h> Designing Challenges : <p> In today 's world , one has to stay aggressive in order to lead the rat race . In designing industry , there is a lot of competition and to stay ahead designers should focus on being both , technical and strategic . Before I get into the recent challenges faced by designers , how about we dive a little bit into the history of designers ? They have been witnessing challenges since ever . 5902 @qwx625902 <h> 1. - - Playing it safe : <p> In late 90s web designing was taking baby steps . Even then , poor designers were stuck with static presentations because clients knew nothing about web designing and all they wanted was a website similar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretty simple because the simplest layout was the safest best . Designers did not have much scope to do or learn back then and almost all websites looked similar . <h> 2. - - Welcome to the world of Flash ' : <p> A few years later , the clients were willing to try something new but it must have flash and pop-ups . The good thing was that designers were no longer working on tables and they have moved to divs . Now , instead of boring layouts , clients wanted flashy and colorful websites . Everyone wanted a flashy intro ( which makes the site slow ) . This is when designers were told not to focus on any sort of content . The visual sparkle was much more important . <h> 3. - - A new jump in the designing industry : <p> The good thing is that flashy video trend did not last that long . A few years later , designers entered into the world of AJAX . This was the time when content overshadowed the graphical representations . <h> 4. - - Designers and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ options available as far as browsers were concerned . The list was no longer limited to IE and Netscape . Firefox , Opera and safari came into the market . The introduction of new browsers brought a lot of challenges for the designers . They had to face compatibility issues , layout issues and what not . <h> Changing Trends " The Real Challenge : <p> The whole concept behind peeking into the history was to highlight the main reason behind making this job a challenging one . A graphic designer 's job changes with the changing trends and trends change way too quickly . Adapting these changes becomes really challenging . <p> Recent biggest challenge : <p> Now that you are aware of the fact that trends are changing like anything and with the changing trends , as a designer you should expect lots of changes in clients as well . The new challenge for designers is mobile web designing , thanks to smartphones . <p> Now , before we get into the details of biggest challenge , let us talk about some other challenges designers are facing these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> We can not deny the fact that web has become an integral part of our daily lives . One of the biggest challenges a web designer has to face is to make his website accessible on a larger scale . Now , defining website 's accessibility is not an easy thing but to be precise , your website should be accessible to people belonging from different countries , backgrounds using different browsers . As a designer it is your responsibility to create a website which is not only accessible across the globe but all the features are functional as well . <h> 2. - - Browser Compatibility : <p> Earlier designers used to overlook this aspect but with the introduction of so many new browsers , designers have to face this challenge of creating a website which is compatible with almost all browsers . Not only this , once you have created a browser compatible website , you need to get it tested on all browsers to make sure that website is functional . <h> 3. - - Navigational Challenges : <p> Navigational structure is indeed a very big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to navigate through your website , he will leave it without wasting any moment . So , navigation is one of the most important aspects of any website because usability of the website depends on a good navigational structure . So , designers have to make sure that they provide users ' with a proper navigational structure so that users do not face any problem during their visit . <h> 4. - - Content Placement : <p> Another issue faced by designers is to provide a readable website . It is entirely up to a designer to place the content in a way which enhances the easy reading . While designers are working on website 's structure , they have to be very careful with content placement because if the content is not readable , users ' will leave the website . When it comes to font , usage of proper colors is also very important . <h> Responsive Web Designing " The biggest challenge : <p> Despite the fact that responsive web designing has been around for quite some time now , designers still face a lot of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the challenges designers face due to RWD : <h> - - - - - Amplification of RWD : <p> Earlier , explaining clients as to how their website will be designed was quite easy . Since it was not way too technical , clients ' used to understand things after a little bit of clarification . Designers had to get a simple wireframe of the website approved . However , this is no longer the case . Showing a visual stage for responsive web design is not at all an easy task . If you want an easy solution for this , I have it . All you need to do is show your client a demo of a responsive website you have already created and you are good to go . <h> - - - - - Static or Sketches : <p> Designers no longer want to create a static layout in order to show it to the client . They now prefer sketches which are easy and quick to make . Clients still want static layout which puts the designer in a trouble . I would recommend designers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also help clients in understanding . Also , everyone has his own way of working so if you have any other way of creating a wireframe , please stick to whatever you are comfortable with . <h> - - - - - Navigation and Images : <p> Earlier , the website navigation was only horizontal . However , with so many different kinds of devices available , navigation has become a big challenge for designers . As a designer you should analyze your website and then decide the navigational structure . Be sure to design something consistent . Apart from this , image handling is another challenge . How to design a website with images so they are properly viewable on all devices ? Unfortunately for responsive images , there is no ultimate solution but you will find various solutions such as SVG Graphics today by Josh , online . <p> Other challenges include : <p> - - - - - Data tables <p> - - - - - Conversion of old websites <p> - - - - - Old versions of IE <p> - - - - - Testing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the only people to face challenges during website creation . Developers have to face a lot of challenges as well . Although , there are various challenges developers have to face , a few challenges keep coming back to them every now and then . These issues have nothing to do with programming but yes , due to advancement in technology , things have gotten a lot complicated . <p> Let us take a look at challenges faced by developers on regular basis . <h> 1. - - Availability of various browsers : <p> To begin with , you can choose a browser that you use on regular basis . Initially , users ' had only one browser which made it convenient for developers as well . They had to develop a website which was compatible with IE only . But in past few years , a lot of new browsers have been introduced . As mentioned above , multiple browsers have been issue for designers but it is a major challenge for developers as well . Developers have to make sure that they take care of HTML/CSS needs for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ web developer has to validate his code for different environments since a lot of different windows platforms are available . <h> 2. - - JavaScript : <p> Usage of JavaScript has always been a part of discussion among developers . You will find different opinions whether to use JavaScript or not especially after the AJAX has been introduced . - We can only assume the number of people of people who have JavaScript activated on their browsers . If there are people who have enabled JavaScript , there will be a few people who are not very comfortable activating it OR they could be using a mobile device . <p> So , the challenge here is to decide whether developers should or should not rely on JavaScript . A wise developer will never tell you to rely on JavaScript . While you are developing a website , develop it without JavaScript . When your website is functional without JavaScript , you can always add AJAXy in order to make things convenient for the users who are visiting your website. <h> 3. - - Cookies : <p> Cookies issue is once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every now and then . As a developer , you have to fix the bugs related to browsers however ; users ' who have disabled their cookies will be a huge challenge for you . Since users ' are not very technical , they do not understand they deactivating cookies can cause a lot of issues . <p> You might find ways to dodge the challenge for instance adding PHPESSID but that will only make things look uglier and will also bring some serious security issues . This whole thing will just give you a headache . In order to save yourself from so much hassle , do not allow viewing of your website if the cookies have been disabled . If a user who has disabled cookies visits your website , you can inform him to enable cookies in order to be able to view your website . This will save you and the user from a lot of trouble . <p> The issues mentioned above are the recurring issues a developer has to face . Other than this a web developer now has to face a lot of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mobile Web Developments Challenges : <p> Developers can no longer ignore the importance of mobile web development . Due to smartphones , websites are being accessed via mobile devices . The major challenge for developers is to carry out the testing for mobile websites . Other than this , there is a wide range of mobile devices available and due to this , there will be various browsers available . Developing a website compatible with all browsers is a huge challenge . <h> - - - - - Screen Sizes : <p> Mobile technology is constantly evolving and we see new phones in the market every now and then . All of them are with different screen sizes and a developer has to make sure that he develops a website which is compatible with all screen sizes and is easily viewable. <h> - - - - - Instant Changes : <p> As mentioned above , technology is changing like anything . Developers have to constantly study the new technology and develop the website accordingly . <h> - - - - - Testing Challenges : <p> This is a huge challenge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ website can not be tested on all of them . So if you want to test your website , you can get it tested on the most famous phones . Almost all major features should be tested to see if they are functional or not . <h> Conclusion : <p> Designers and developers both have to face a lot of issues during designing and developing . A lot of issues faced are common between designers and developers because both are interlinked with each other .

@@73219895 @1919895/ <h> Understand the pros and cons of using GitHub <p> As a developer , you may have heard of GitHub , or you may have used it yourself . <p> GitHub offers a Git repository service , which is web based and allows you to use Gits source-code management functionality , along with its own features . <p> Many people in the creative and technical developer circles rave on about GitHub . How good is it really and is it worth the trouble learning Git to use it ? There are many benefits to using GitHub , however there are also are some noted disadvantages which well discuss here . 5902 @qwx625902 <p> So let 's begin to better understand the pros and cons to using GitHub : <p> The pros <p> GitHub is a very versatile tool to use . Its ideal for working on projects of any size and its a great tool for web work flows . Firstly you can use it for publishing your work , as a versioning control system and as a collaborative tool . <p> With GitHub you can archive your projects and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them to collaborate on . The beauty of it is that you can have more than one person collaborate remotely on a project , so you 're all on the same page , so to speak . <p> Its ideal for creating a backup of your work instead on saving the code on a desktop or on a corporate server . <p> It is also beneficial to use if you 're learning Git . One way to look at it is seeing Git as a preventative maintenance process , where you get into the flow of doing reverts , commits , pulling , pushing , and so forth , as needed. - It can save you a lot of hassle if a problem occurs , or if you need to revert code of any sort . One of the best features is being able to track mistakes , and its definitely made easier by using GitHub . Bugs can be opened , and thanks to GitHub , you can add commits to these and associate it with the problem . <p> With GitHub pages , you can get started quickly without worrying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> If you 're new to GitHub , one of the challenges often talked about is getting to grips with the mental model , which eases with practice and time . <p> It may not be the best tool for capturing the creative process or for recording ideas . A good tool for this particular function would be LayerVault or something similar to it . We 'd say Git is very good for tracking code , however its not the best for tracking design . It can seem a little bit of a grey area when designs are needed to be translated into code or for when you need to export designs to a production setting . <p> It depends on the designer , however , some find the GUI a little confusing to use and opt to use its CLI instead . Some developers learnt Git by mostly using commands , which explains why the GUI is n't always liked by them . With a little practice , the commands are not too difficult to learn . However using Commands everyday can be awkward , especially when tracking project history or resolving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ GUI instead of commands , - as the visual representation of previous commits , modified files and diffs can make better sense . As mentioned previously , it can take some getting used to . <p> It costs to have a versioning repository on GitHub , however it is worth the investment if you 're working professionally . <h> Final Thoughts <p> Overall , its always good to use a versioning control system . Its definitely worth the effort , time and investment as it can give you much more flexibility and peace of mind for any project . Git overall , is useful for anyone who codes , giving any developer or coder plenty of value to not take notice of it . And what better way than to use a platform such as GitHub . The price plans are very reasonable , even for private use with 5 repositories at $7 a month with unlimited collaborators or for corporations $25 a month for10 repositories . <p> Now you have a clearer overview on the pros and cons of using GitHub , we hope that article has served you well in understanding its potential . 5901 @qwx625901 5903 @qwx625903

The best way to disclose the theme and to hide the suspense is to use illustrations . Images are a great way to attract viewer 's attention without disclosing the details of the movie . This idea works great for horror and suspense movies . Horror or rough images will surely grab the attention of users . If it is a romantic image , you can obviously create a dreamy effect . <h> 3. - Giving your viewers an incentive <p> Theme for all movies can not be explained via iconography .

Your test as a designer is to be able to bring non-fans to the cinema theatres as well . It is very important for a designer to highlight correct things in a poster .

@@73219907 @1919907/ <h> 7 Innovations Necessary for the Success of iPhone 5 <p> iPhone A name that took the mobile industry by storm when it launched in 2007 . It totally revolutionized the cell phone industry . I still remember watching Steve Jobs ( Apples Late CEO ) presenting the iPhone ( 1st generation ) and demonstrating the iPhones features and showcased the unique qualities of the iPhone . Over the years , each and every successor of the iPhone has been more successful and made better than its predecessors . Apple was supposed to be unveiling the iPhone 5 last year , as the media reports suggested but as we all know , it was the iPhone 4s that was unveiled . Many people were surprised and not happy with the iPhone 4s , mainly because of its similar looks to the iPhone 4 . Although , Apple did n't  change and improve the look and shape of the iPhone 4s , they did bring changes internally in the iPhone 4s by adding an 8MP camera , Dual Core A5 chip , 1080p HD video recording , iOS 5 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them all , Siri . Siri is an- - intelligent personal assistant that answers almost all your questions and provide assistance whenever needed . <p> These were the innovations that helped in to make the iPhone 4s successful but there are some innovations that I think are necessary for the success of the next-gen iPhone , that is the iPhone 5. <h> 1 . A Sleeker Design <p> The iPhones design has played a major role in its success . Ever since the first iPhone was unveiled , the first thing that came into the minds of the- people was " Its so different than the other smartphones " . This is something that made the iPhone standout among all the smartphones at that point of time . As time passed , slowly and gradually every mobile company came out with their rip-offs of the iPhone , by releasing phones after phones that looked and felt the same with the touch screen and home buttons . Now , Apple has to do it again . <p> They have to come up with a unique design again that will just make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say , " WOW " . That 's what I want . 5902 @qwx625902 <h> 2 . Bigger Display <p> The iPhones have had 3.5 inches of screen display which made it a great phone back in the days of iPhone 3GS and iPhone 4 but not now . I am saying this because many companies have come up with different cell phones that have a bigger display and is very easy to work with . For example , Samsung Galaxy Note has a 5.3 inches of screen display , Samsung Galaxy SII has a 4.3 inches of screen display , HTC One X has a 4.7 inches of screen display . The newer models of cell phones have a wider screen display which is liked by people nowadays . They want to explore the touch screen of the cell phones by having a larger display . The cell phones above that I mentioned are the ones which have been liked and appreciated by a wide number of users and has been applauded for it . The upcoming Samsung Galaxy SIII , I assume will also be having a bigger display @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they do n't  come up with a larger display as Samsungs Galaxy SII has been the only smartphone that has managed to give the iPhone a hard time . <p> A- South Korean media outlet has said that Apple is putting in orders with suppliers for a 4.6-inch Retina Display . This may allow the company more room to update the chips inside the new iPhone , perhaps adding the A5X . This means that we the iPhone 5 can really be worth the wait ! <h> 3. 4G LTE <p> 4G has been something that has been missing from the iPhones for some time now . One thing - that disappoints many iPhone users is that the iPhones still have not been integrated with 4G LTE , whereas many other cell phone companies have successfully managed to come up with mobile phones that have 4G LTE and one of the key reasons for the success of those phones is that people want to explore the 4G technology . They do n't  want to be restricted to the 3G . One thing I am sure of is that if Apple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I doubt its success . I think that will not be the case because as the news suggests , Apple is definitely going on with the 4G technology . As we saw earlier this year , Apples new iPad has 4G technology and I doubt the fact that they wo n't integrate their next iPhone with the 4G . <p> Qualcomm- recently unveiled- the fifth iteration of its new chip , which supports TD-SCDMA , TD-LTE , HSPA+ , EV-DO , embedded GPS , and LTE on TDD and FDD networks worldwide . The chip works with- Android- and Windows 8 devices , but there 's a great chance this will be the chip inside the iPhone 5. <h> 4 . OLED Display <p> It is the new big thing in the Cell Phone industry . The most recent cell phone that left a big impact on the whole cell phone industry was the Samsung Galaxy SII . It had a Super AMOLED Plus display . This- screen technology is also brighter , thinner with AMOLED Plus displays being 18% more energy efficient than the old Super AMOLED displays. - Apple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chip , which is the quad-core graphics processor used to power the Retina Display in- the new iPad. - On April 4 , the Korea Times reported that- Apple is interested- in switching from LCD to OLED displays for its next round of iPhones and iPads . <p> It would be a great step towards the future of iPhones if Apple did choose the OLED displays for its next round of iPhones and iPads. <h> 5 . Better Battery Life <p> As we all know , iPhones do n't  have a long lasting battery life and have to be charged within 8-12 hours of use of if you 're going to be browsing the internet on it , clicking photos , watching videos , playing games , making calls . All these activities drain the battery alot .

More Storage <p> Storage has been a major if not the biggest issue nowadays with people wanting more and more storage for their - Movies , Pictures , Videos , Apps , Music in their cell phones and particularly the iPhones . The iPhones , as we already know only provide , 16,32 or 64 GB of storage to iPhone customers which is nowadays , not enough . Perhaps , a 128 GB iPhone ? It - would be great for the people who want more <p> storage and want all their Movies , Apps , Music etc on the go at all times with them without worrying about storage . <h> 7 .

When considering architecture as the process and product of planning it simply means constructing a building .

For all the lovers of Photoshop , we have decided to write this article to relive adobe 's journey of 22 years with you . <p> Adobe Photoshop has evolved so much in these years and they have introduced so many new features that whenever a new version releases , there comes a point when we wonder how Photoshop survived without all these new features .

He wrote a subroutine program in order to be able to convert a few pictures to grayscale . A simple process of converting images to grayscale , lead Thomas to develop more ideas like this and very soon he had plenty of processes to give effects on photographs . John supported Thomas totally and suggested him to come up with a full photo editor .

Without clients you are obviously nothing because they are the main source of your income so keeping them happy is very important . However , this does not mean that you should be completely dependent on them . If you have spent years in designing industry , you would obviously know by now that all clients are not good clients . You will have to do work with some really difficult clients as well . If you are a newbie , you obviously can not afford to turn down an offer regardless of how difficult the client comes across because you are desperate to gain experience . <p> For any relationship to work cooperation and mutual understanding is a must . But some clients are unaware of these words . - In order to be a successful designer , you must follow work ethics but there is a certain kind of clients that needs to be avoided so that designing does not become a futile exercise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel that it is impossible to make this client happy or if you have an intuition that this client will not be an easy payer . It is difficult for newbie's- to judge difficult clients but observing their behavior can really help in judging them and then turning down their offer . <p> Let 's take a look at 10 warning signs to identify bad client types . 5902 @qwx625902 <h> Best critics of your previous work <p> If you are just a few projects old in designing industry , you will obviously keep the prices lower than the established designers . Although it can help you in getting new work but some clients will look down on you because of low prices . These are the clients who will criticize everything in your previous work . They will always tell you that your previous work was not up to the mark and hopefully this time you can put in some honest effort . If you hear anything of this sort , do yourself a favor and turn down the offer from the client then and there . <h> Too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rough idea in his mind as to what he wants from a designer that he is about to hire . Obviously , he would want to achieve something par excellence but he would be intelligent enough to have real expectations from the designer . Clients who are confused and have too many expectations from a designer are difficult clients to deal with . Managing their expectations can get really difficult . So , if you want to save yourself from hassle , avoid working for clients with too many expectations . <h> History of bad experiences <p> A client who has a list of bad experiences in the past should be avoided . Such clients are never happy with anyone 's work and that is generally because of unrealistic expectations . If a client tells you that previous designer was horrible , do ask them a few questions regarding what they disliked- - about your previous work . This will help you in analyzing if it was actually the designer who was at fault or if it is the client who was impossible to satisfy . If they paint a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past was horrible , do not work with them because you do not want to be a new addition in their list . <h> Bound to Pick Holes <p> If you are lucky enough to take hold of a project , the initial requirements would be to send out a proposal with all the details regarding project . Some clients are in a habit to nit-pick on everything and if a client picks out way too many mistakes in your proposal or initial ideas , it is time to move on . Now , I am not saying that you should not be open to changes . If there is a room for some logical changes , go ahead and change things accordingly . However , if you feel that client is just picking out on things for the sake of it , there should be no looking back . <h> Slow Pacers <p> Some clients like to drag their feet . They will take so much time in just responding to a single email . Due to such slow pacers , your whole schedule is bound to get disturbed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if this happens once or twice , it is okay . However , if they are taking too much time in providing feedback or replying to your important emails , opt out of the project . If a client takes more than required time just to sign the contract , consider it a warning and avoid getting into any mess by working with him . <h> Reason behind communication gap <p> It is important for designer and client to have a good communication level so that all questions are answered in the beginning leaving no room for misunderstanding . Some clients do want an exceptional result from you however ; they are not willing to participate in the project . A client has to give out a proper direction to the designer so that he can deliver the desired results . If a client thinks that figuring everything out is a designer 's duty because they are being paid , it is definitely- a wrong approach . Most clients do understand that proper communication is very important and they provide designer a platform to begin with . <h> Know-it-all <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ front of you , I can assure you that this client will act as if he knows each and everything about designing . Sometimes , they think that their knowledge is more than a designer 's knowledge . They will have a bossy attitude and they will undermine your talents and capabilities . Obviously you do not want to be treated as a puppet . If you are facing difference of opinion in everything , avoid such clients . You will only end up wasting your time and efforts . <h> An Indifferent breed <p> This is the kind which is totally different from the one mentioned above . This breed of clients will be least interested in the project . This will result into misunderstandings and final project will be full of flaws . So , try and avoid clients who are not interested in their own project . <h> Always in a rush <p> You will also come across a few clients who will be in a rush , always . They can also be called hasty clients . They will expect you to finish work in no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the procedure of designing , they would still want their project designed in no time which is obviously is impossible . Avoid working with such clients as they affect the quality of your work . <h> Love Bargaining <p> This type of clients is also known as cheapskate clients . They will bargain on pricing every time they see you . It does not matter if you have told them a million times that your fee is fixed . They will still try their level best to make some room for bargaining . Avoid such clients who can not value your work 's worth . <h> Conclusion <p> There are no dream clients in designing industry . You will obviously get to work with clients that are easy to deal with . But , you should avoid working with the types mentioned above because gradually you will realize that it was not worth it . 5901 @qwx625901 5903 @qwx625903

@@73219946 @1919946/ <h> 8 tips to create amazing photographs of the sky <p> All too often , the sky is used merely as a backdrop for a regular landscape composition or is cropped out of the shot altogether . Yet if you look up , some of the most dramatic shapes , colours , and lighting take place right above us in the sky . Clouds , stars , sunsets , storms , and the northern lights are all examples of intriguing photographic subjects taking place in the sky . The following tips can help you do them justice . <h> 1 . Choose a time of day with the right lighting <p> Sunrise and sunset are typically two of the best times to take photographs of the sky , due to the intense colours and interesting shapes . The deepest colours are usually about 15 minutes before sunrise or after sunset . However , the night sky can also be an intriguing subject , allowing you to photograph the aurora borealis , moon , stars , and meteor showers . <h> 2 . Choose a setting in advance <p> Take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away , so that you can find the ideal setting for your shot . You want a panoramic view of the sky , for a more dramatic end product . If you 're photographing the night sky , you 'll also want to be clear of manmade lighting that could interfere with your shot . 5902 @qwx625902 <h> 3 . Reduce shutter speed to capture clouds <p> There can be a great deal of glare when you 're photographing the sky in the daytime , so try reducing your shutter speed to get a crisper look . This can define the outlines of clouds and darken the rest of your image slightly . <h> 4 . Avoid obstructions in your sky-scape <p> Watch out for trees , buildings , or other objects in your way when you 're trying to take a full sky-scape shot . You want to have a clear , clean view of the sky , without a cluttered composition . <h> 5 . Capture changes in weather <p> Some of the most exciting photographs depict extreme weather , such as a city skyline with dark clouds approaching or the moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . An approaching thunderstorm often is shown with billowing shapes and changing textures , making it a fascinating subject for photographers . <h> 6 . Use clouds to create emotion in photograph <p> Along the same lines as the tip above , you can also use clouds to create emotion or drama in your photographs . Think of the difference between bright , fluffy white clouds and dark storm clouds , for example . <h> 7 . Choose the right equipment <p> A simple digital camera is all you need to photograph the sky , provided that it allows you to change the focus and shutter speed . However , you can improve your shots with additional features such as a tripod and different types of lenses . Tripods are particularly useful for photographing the night sky , in order to get clear shots of the stars above , while a wide angle lens can help you capture a sweeping sky scene . Its helpful to take a digital photography course to learn how to best use this equipment . <h> 8 . Experiment with filters <p> Another piece of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sky is a polarizing filter . This reduces glare , and can help prevent your pictures from looking washed out and overexposed . The filter wont work when the sun is directly in front of you , so you 'll want to keep the sun to your right or left . <p> By keeping these tips in mind , you 'll be able to create some stunning landscape photos with the entire sky as your subject . 5901 @qwx625901 5903 @qwx625903 <h> Subscribe to Smashing Hub <h> Related Articles <h> 1 Comment <p> Reducing ( slowing ) shutter speed wont reduce glare or increase **26;58;TOOLONG .

Getting ahead is obviously not an easy task as developers have to face a tough competition out there . So , how do you get ahead is a million dollar question right now . Let us take a look at a few of the things developers can do to get ahead of other developers . <h> Internet " A Great Source of Information <p> Internet is the best and a great source of information for everyone . If you want to learn about new techniques in web development world , you can always search for those things online . I would recommend all of the designers to subscribe to RSS feed if they still have n't . The schedule of designers is very busy so visiting sites on regular basis can be a little difficult . Subscribing to RSS would help you in staying up to date . It is another tips for designer " 10 Ways to Help Designers Make Money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blogs are a great source of information . A lot of developers or designers would be running blogs related to your field and they can really help you in learning new techniques . If you have a little free time on your hands , the best way to find new things is by visiting a blog and start reading comments or exploring archives in the blogs . You will find a lot of tutorials and additional information that can prove to be really beneficial for you . If you want to get ahead , you need to do something different so instead of reading popular blogs , search and read blogs that are really good but they go unnoticed . <h> Take Ownership " Start Your Own Blog <p> When you have enough knowledge about blogs , the best option for you would be starting your own blog . Once you start writing about web development , you will realize that you are not only getting better at communicating things but there is a lot that you are discovering as well . Since you would want to be the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ realize that you are more updated with all the happenings around . <p> The best way to do all this is to do a good research initially and then write about it . While writing and researching , you will be learning a lot of new skills which will put you one step ahead of others in the league . <h> Books " Do not Underestimate Them <p> People have started ignoring the importance of books ever since the information is available on the internet . However , I personally think that nothing can replace a good book and the information it contains . If you want the in-depth knowledge of what you have been reading on internet , you need to go and grab some books to learn more . Web development is such a vast field that you can never get enough information so if you are done with one topic , go and get books for another . <p> The best thing about books is that they are always available for references . You do not have to search the content again and again like you to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pages or turn the corner of the pages to remember the important topics . <h> Reading is not Enough " Do it Practically ! <p> Being a freeloader is not really going to help . If you really want to learn something , you need to start doing things on your own . Do n't just read because this will never let you learn the procedures . If you want to do something , find tutorials and start following them . This is a great way to learn because reading can only give you information .

@@73219961 @1919961/ <h> 6 ways to increase the amount of content on your website <p> In todays online marketing world , content is king . If you want to increase brand awareness , get more engagement on your site , and increase the amount of people visiting your site , you need to be continuously adding fresh content . When you add new content , it improves your standings in search engines , along with allowing your visitors to share the content with their friends and family . <p> There are many benefits to having great content added to your site on a regular basis , but the problem is getting that content . Below are some ideas for how you can consistently add new content to your site . <h> Blogging <p> The first thing you should do is set up a blog on your site . Having a blog allows you to have a place on your site where you can add new content , without having to rearrange or change the layout of your existing website . You can write about what your company is currently working on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have going on , or anything else . Just remember to keep your content engaging and related to your topic . 5902 @qwx625902 <h> Guest Blogging <p> Blogs are great for your website , but it can be hard to come up with new topics all of the time , or maybe the time spent on it simply does not give you a good ROI . A solution is to look for guest bloggers . This is when you ask someone to write an article for your website , and in return you allow them to link back to their website . Many people are happy to do this as it gains exposure for their website , and you get free content for your website . There are many benefits to this system , and it is essentially a win-win for both parties . <h> Aggregate News <p> Rather than writing up lengthy articles on all of the things happening in your industry , let another site do it . Find a site that reports on the news , then simply write a summary of it on your blog . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your site can find out more if they so choose . This is a great way to add another page to your website , without having to take the time to write an entire article . However , be sure you are citing your sources , otherwise you will be guilty of plagiarism . <h> Video Tutorials <p> If you have the means to produce them , and if it suits your company , having video tutorials on your website can be of great benefit . For example , if you are the owner of a hardware store , you could have videos that show people proper painting techniques . If you cant make the videos yourself , find some on YouTube that you can use , write up your own description , and be sure to once again link back to the source . <h> Video Transcripts <p> Sometimes people do n't  have time to watch the entire video , or would simply prefer to read about the topic . If you produced videos for your site , consider having them transcribed as an added feature for your visitors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quick transcriptions of your videos , turn them into their own blog post , and in turn , grow your business . If your company works a lot with videos , then turning them into separate blog posts is definitely something you will want to consider . <h> Portfolios and Photo Albums <p> Lastly , if you have any pictures at all of your business or the work you have done , you should absolutely have them on your site . Photo albums are fairly easy to create , and allow you to display photos that can often say a lot more than words . While you can tell someone about the great cabinets you built , it might be much better to show them . <p> If you can put the 6 things above into practice , you should have no trouble at all adding fresh content to your website on a regular basis . We recommend using all of them to some degree , and not just sticking with one method . Diversifying will look better , and please more people . Just remember to make sure your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simply focus on quantity . 5901 @qwx625901 5903 @qwx625903

Everyone has their own way of making others agree to their will . Some people will use their power , some will plan a deceit but the most convenient and much used option is manipulation . If you are manipulating someone , technically , you are not committing a crime and people will be convinced on what you want from them . <p> Manipulating tricks are also used professionally . Because these tricks and techniques of manipulation have been successful for years now , people prefer to use manipulation tricks to get what they want . In our daily lives , clients and even an employee , both are manipulating things to make sure that things go as per their choice . However , the clever one will win for sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be well aware of the tricks used by clients to manipulate you and your fellow freelancers . The worst thing about manipulation is that sometimes people do n't even realize that they are being manipulated . <p> Let us take a look at the tricks used by clients to manipulate freelancers so that freelancers can learn how to dodge these tricks . 5902 @qwx625902 <h> Delusion <p> Delusion or using misconceptions as a tool to manipulate should be considered as one of the most famous manipulation trick . This kind of manipulation is being practiced in the entire world and the best part is that victim does not realize that they are being manipulated . Sometimes the person playing the trick is also unaware of his plans . In this trick client will pick a common misconception and then will state the misconception as a fact just for the sake of winning and argument . Sometimes , clients pay less to designers just because they have a misconception that designers can not give a quality work in comparison to huge design firms which is exactly why he pays less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such cases , client is manipulating but he , too , is unaware . <h> Convincing someone when they are preoccupied <p> This is again a great trick to play in order to manipulate things . Again , this kind of trick is practiced in our daily lives as well . If a kid wants something from mother , he wo n't go up to her when she is absolutely free . Instead , he will walk up to her when she is already occupied with something really important . This will give kid an edge and mother will agree because she is too busy to listen to cross question him . Same goes for clients because if they see a freelancer has too much work to handle , they will put forward a request regarding work and will ask for a favor . Poor freelancer , who is already busy wo n't have enough time to go through the task at that time , he will say yes and then he will realize that he has been caught into client 's manipulation . <h> Using power to convince <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have heard this phrase and it is true . Power brings authority and people misuse it . People user their power , superior position to manipulate and this kind of manipulation is again very common in our everyday life . Just because they have authority they wo n't care about what you feel and what your say is . They will simply use their authority to get the work done . <h> Changing topics instantly <p> This is a very clever move where the manipulator changes the topic instantly and starts some topic which has a distant relationship with the topic that was already going on . This technique is only successful if the manipulator is good enough to change the topic instantly . The faster manipulator is the favorable it is for him . <h> Taking advantage of guilt <p> If a manipulator gets successful in assuming that the other person is guilty of something , he will take advantage of guilt in order to get something done . Other person who is already feeling guilty of doing something wrong will allow the other person to take advantage of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manipulation is often used by high tech professionals such as doctors or people related to information technology . It is programming basically jargon language of such professionals. - It is a great tactic to get something done from a person without informing him what is going on around . This also gives manipulator the authority to decide what should be revealed and what should be kept under the sheets . <h> Building a bridge to get the request fulfilled <p> This is one tactic that I am sure everyone has used it at some point . We all have had a few requests that we knew will be denied when requested . In such cases , manipulator asks for something that can not be said no to . This technique works because many people do n't like refusing someone again and again . So , if a client makes first , second , third request and hears a No , forth time he will put forward a request that he actually wants and the freelancer who has been constantly saying No will eventually say yes . <h> One step at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small thing and then slowly and gradually mover for bigger and better thins . This is what we call stepping up manipulation and a client takes advantage of other person saying yes to his small requests . <h> Reaching to conclusions <p> Just to get the work done , some clients reach to conclusions and start making comparisons with freelancer 's competitors . - Such razor thin conclusions are a great way to get your work done . Poor victim , just to prove that he can do it just like anyone else , will agree to manipulator 's work . <h> Giving away a false impression <p> In this trick , a client usually portrays a false impression of the project and tells the freelancer that it is really easy and wo n't take much time . However , once handed over to the victim , he realizes that he was trapped . <h> Portraying project as a great Opportunity ' <p> Some clients will make their project appear like it is very unique and victim should go for it otherwise he will lose out on a great opportunity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is bound to drive up the demand of the project and the victim might agree to all terms and conditions of a manipulator . <h> Fear formation <p> This technique is being used by every other person . The best way to get something done from other person is to from a fear in him of losing something that is very important and this is exactly what most clients or employers do . From the fear of getting fired or staying out of work , people agree with working on the terms of manipulator . <h> Conclusion <p> Different people will use different manipulation tricks to get their work done . This kind of manipulation has been going on for ages and is most likely to continue for years as well . However , if you are aware of such tricks , you can avoid becoming a victim of manipulation . 5901 @qwx625901 5903 @qwx625903 <h> Related Articles <h> 1 Comment <p> I like your points , but most of these should be common business sense .

Analyze yourself when you are in a store and the way you act as a customer . Yes , this is exactly the way your visitors act when they see your website . Honestly speaking and we all will accept this fact ; most of do n't even read the entire text of the website .

@@73220081 @1920081/ <h> Pros and cons of cloud hosting vs shared hosting <p> If you have a great idea for a blog , website or web service , one of the first things you will need to decide before you make it live is what kind of hosting is most suitable . Generally , you have four main options . Free hosting , for example on a free Blogger or WordPress blog , can be a nice option if you simply want to make a regular blog with your ideas , news , recipes or stories on it , but it does n't  look very professional to have a free site on one of these domains so if you are planning on monetising your site or having a site for your existing business , it is better to invest in some paid hosting . <h> The Different Types of Paid Web Hosting <p> The most traditional type of hosting people with small scale websites go for is called shared server hosting . This is when your provider owns a server farm with lots of resources , and for a monthly fee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a contract that says how much bandwidth you can have , and which other facilities will be available to you . In many cases , you will get additional benefits like website creation wizards , email addresses , and even some credit to advertise your new site free on things like Facebook and AdWords . There are so many companies offering these services that the market is hugely competitive and you can get some very cheap deals , making the cost of shared hosting almost negligible when you are considering start up costs for your new enterprise . In some cases you can also get other things you need , like a domain name , from the same provider . Click here , for example , to see the kinds of hosting deals available to you . <p> As well as shared hosting , you can get dedicated server hosting , which is a lot more expensive and is usually only a consideration for things like SaaS ( software as a service ) or business critical websites , or you can get cloud hosting . 5902 @qwx625902 <h> The Pros @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ways similar to shared , in that your site is on a shared set of server resources and only uses the facilities it needs at any given time . It is very stable , because there is all kinds of redundancy built into cloud server networks , and your site will not run out of bandwidth or start kicking users off because you have used more than the entitlement in your contract . However , with cloud you pay for what you have used in a month , rather than a flat rate . This is the only real downside " it can be hard to predict how much it will cost if your site scales up very quickly or becomes an overnight success ! <p> In general , a lot of website owners are moving towards cloud over traditional hosting deals , but if you want predictable costs at the start of your venture shared hosting does still have some advantages . 5901 @qwx625901 5903 @qwx625903

Forums are for sure addictive so make sure you do not end up wasting a lot of time on them . <h> Disorganized Communication <p> It is important to stay in touch with other bloggers but excess of anything is bad . Do not waste your time in disorganized and useless interactions . Avoid spending a lot of time on replying to professional emails , unless they are really important . When working for a blog , dedicate your time to blogging only . <h> Proofreading is a MUST <p> I know it is boring to read something again and again but it is important .

@@73220096 @1920096/ <h> Mid-year Resolutions for Better Growth of Your Designer Self <p> It is never too late to mend , I mean no matter it 's a New Year or a Mid-year , taking control of your growth strategies as a designer should always be on top of your mind . The desire to excel is inevitable , however ; the definition of success is relative for every human being . So , people who aspire to achieve success like to grow more and more every day . In order to understand the pertinent relationship between success and growth it is important to add consistency as a variable . It means that consistent growth guarantees of consistent success . <p> Now after shedding some light on the consistent growth , the question I like you to ask yourself is that do you want to consistently improve your design skills ? Well , the good news about this is that you do n't need to go through some rocket science stuff to be a constantly growing designer . There are few and simple things you need to follow that will make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is no magic pill or anything involved in it . Get inspired from some great design . <p> Please feel free to join us and you are always welcome to share your thoughts that our readers may like . <h> Resolution # 1 <h> One Thing a Day Keeps Designer 's Block Away 5902 @qwx625902 <p> As we all know this fact that there are no shortcuts or hidden tricks for success in life , however ; there are some simple things can take you to your destination quickly . The resolution for making things happen is learn/do one design thing each day that you think is difficult but important . <p> The one thing I mentioned does not have to be specific , it can be a technique you have been learning but have not applied yet , or a color or matching fonts choice you 're itching to try , or a new arrangement of elements . The resolution is to just implement one of these new things each day . Once you stick to this resolution determinately and consistently , you 'll slowly but steadily grow as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2 <h> Work Hard Dream Less A Key to Success <p> People often want to achieve everything they can think without being pragmatic . On the other hand big sweeping changes and self-pledges almost never yield growth . Do n't dream too big which has rare possibility to sustain . <p> One such example is coming up with countless New Year resolutions . I am sure I never met anyone who has achieved even 50% of what he dreamt off at New Year eve . Once you think big you need to make a lot of changes and these are certainly not small alterations . So , these kinds of changes are too sudden and drastic for you to be able to keep doing them . This activity drained you out and you tend to rightfully give up , like many of us . <p> Now look it from another angel by dreaming little because it seeks little input . Adopting this approach will enable you to make small and doable changes . One can not be expert of design overnight it is just humanly not possible , however ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bring drastic change in terms of improved skills , better design style , more adventurous ideas . As you now will dream little , work hard so now just wait for the success <h> Resolution # 3 <h> Turning into a Habitual Designer <p> Consistency can be termed as synonymous of habit . Why ? Well , consistency is harmonious uniformity of an individual whereas ; habit is doing something particular on regular/consistent basis . So , brushing your teeth everyday can be said your consistent habit . In the similar way developing a habit of learning one thing a day can actual make your design grow . It works so smoothly like teeth brushing because you do n't think about brushing your teeth each day , similarly you will be habitual about creating a new design every day . <p> The biggest mistake we often do is make unrealistic assumptions of finishing/executing big tasks in one day without any problem . As a designer , you are not supposed to pile up your pending tasks , because at the end you wo n't be able to do anything but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ habit of doing your task bit by bit as per your design habit you would have first avoided the problem , second grown out your comfort zone in enhancing existing design skills . <p> For a change just try to experience developing the habit and add new color combination on your next web design , or to experiment with new fonts for that next banner . So , once you will develop the habit of doing your small things in this manner you will find it working perfectly fine for your tasks and designing capability . Do n't worry if you do n't feel any change in weeks or even a month , it is meant to be time taking because nothing comes easy in life , however ; patience makes the output greater than anticipation . <h> Resolution # 4 <h> Prohibitions <p> The caution here is that once you start going out of your comfort zone more than once then it is highly possible that you wo n't be able to keep that up each day . The whole point of growing constantly as a designer is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ habit . If you still are not sure then better ask yourself that could you do it three times again tomorrow ? And the day after ? And after that ? How about weeks , months from now ? Maybe not . However , doing only one thing is very do-able and realistic . <p> Despite of all the above mentioned precautions , if you still really , really feel confident that you could do 2 for example , then by all means go for it . However , keep the room to drop the second thing if you wo n't be able to keep it up because consistency should be the key not quantity . <h> Resolution # 5 <h> Be Natural and Grow Constantly as a Designer <p> Try to look around you and follow the natural laws because nature chooses best and the most effective way of growing as a designer is also to do small , yet consistent changes in your designing habits . One thing a day will make you constantly grow as a designer . No need to be greedy and overwhelmingly burdened because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will usually cause you to give up . Being realistic and pragmatic is the only thing that can serve you best as a designer . <p> Your design style will be altered by great extent if you adopt it and it would then just the matter of time . By that time you already have a habit of doing that one new **25;208;TOOLONG design thing , you 'll just keep growing as a designer . <h> Conclusion <p> Prosperity comes to those who grow and are always ready to improve their practices . This same logic goes for designers who are constantly striving to survive in a jungle of competitors . If you are serious about the growth and prosperity of your designer self , then I do n't think that you should be waiting for the year end to make new resolution and strategies of success . Mid-year is the best time to evaluate yourself by analyzing the first half of the year and making amendments for the second half . <p> Although I have tried to encompass all the main points , however , you can customize and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your own circumstances . Always remember that improvement is always the decisive factor in the success of your personal and professional life . <p> Happy Mid Year Growing ! ! 5901 @qwx625901 5903 @qwx625903

In fact , people can remember a brand mostly because of a logo . We can also say that logos help people in differentiating between brands . It is very important for all business owners to associate their brand with a well-designed logo that can stay into people 's mind for a long time . This is a great way of branding since an attractive logo attracts large base of audience . <p> If you want to evaluate the effectiveness and importance of logos , you should take a look at the logos of the most famous brands of the world . The logos are constantly evolving with the passage of time and to cater the needs of today . This is exactly what our topic is all about and I find it to be an interesting one . Not only it is informative , you will also learn how things have evolved because of the technology . Today , we have compiled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a look at how their logos have evolved with the passage of time . <h> 1 . Apple : 5902 @qwx625902 <p> I personally find the logo of Apple to be very attractive , simple yet creative . To begin with , Apple introduced their first logo in 1976 with an image of Sir Issac newton discovering gravity . However , the logo was changed to an apple with rainbow stripes in the same year . After a few years , the rainbow apple turned into a silhouette apple and now ever since 2000 , the logo is a monochrome apple . <h> 2 . Shell : <p> Shell 's logo has seen a lot of evolution ever since 1900 , when it was first introduced . From being an inked clamshell drawing , it transformed into what it is today . Initially it was plain black and white but in the year 1961 it was filled with a great color combination i.e. , yellow and red with a text Shell ' . As of now the design has been redefined a little with no text in the logo . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ introduced in 1975 where it was written as Micro-soft ' however , soon the hyphen was removed from the name and a distinctive O was introduced . After that for 12 years there was no change in Microsoft 's logo . In 1987 a new logo was introduced despite the fact that a lot of people were against the redesigning of logo . The new logo had a cut in O which gave it a name of pacman logo . Even today , the logo is almost the same with a few changes here and there . I guess this logo needs no evolution as people can connect to it way too easily . <h> 4 . Volkswagen : <p> Introduced in 1939 , the logo looked like a gear however , the logo evolved with the ending of World War II. - - - - - - - - - The gear and bumped teeth were removed and later in 2000 , the logo was colored into blue from black . <h> 5 . Nike : <p> I do n't think the logo has changed drastically ever since its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had Nike 's name with it . However , the logo now is a fine example of simplicity as it contains only a Nike swoosh and is still so recognizable . <h> 6 . Mozilla Firefox : <p> Honestly , I have not been much of a fan of the introductory logo that came into the market in 2002 . A phoenix with wings outspread " seriously ? However , when the name was changed to Firefox , the logo was redefined and I think this logo looks really good . <h> 7 . Pepsi : <p> Pepsi 's logo has witnessed countless changes ever since 1898 . To begin with Pepsi 's logo was red script Pepsi cola ' on white base . With the passage of time , the font was transformed into a sophisticated one which was easily readable . By 1972 , they transformed the bottle cap with using blue , white and red color and thanks to this evolution , today Pepsi 's logo is that stripped circle . <h> - 8 . Walmart : <p> Walmart 's logo has been pretty much the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over any design . They have been changing colors every now and then and the final version has the company 's tagline with it with a yellow star symbol . <h> 9 . BMW : <p> Ever since 1923 , I have not witnessed any major changes in BMW 's logo but I am sure most of you do not know the concept behind BMW 's logo . The BMW logo symbolizes the movement of an aircraft propeller , of white blades cutting through the blue skies . I am glad that they did not evolve it totally . <h> 10 . Coca Cola : <p> Coca Cola is one of the most famous brands and honestly , the red color is way too much associated with this brand . Initially , in 1886 the Coca Cola logo was just a font spelling out a name . However , after one year Coca Cola logo was transformed thanks to the Spencerian- script which was easily recognizable . After that Coca Cola has been making minor changes in the logo . They have been playing around with the colors but script @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : <p> Most of you wo n't know how LG was given this name . LG is basically a combination of initials of its two previous companies Lucky ' and Gold Star ' . Right after their merger , they turned the name into LG and ever since then the current logo has been with the company . <h> 12 . Mercedes Benz : <p> At the beginning , in 1902 , the Mercedes logo was all about script however , 1909 , the logo was transformed into a three-pointed start symbol and later on in 1933 a circle was added for the star 's enclosure . Ever since then , the things have been almost same . <h> 13 . Master Card : <p> As the first logo suggests , MasterCard was known as Interbank federation in 1966 , hence the I ' in the logo .

@@73220171 @1920171/ <h> Superseding volatility : Managing investment risks <p> An investment portfolio can be thought of much in the same way as a boat sailing upon the ocean . Should the seas become rough , the boat will founder if it is not handled correctly or it is imbalanced . The marketplace can be just as volatile and unforgiving . This is one of the main reasons why it is so very important to spread your financial risk across different sectors and assets . Let 's take a look at this concept in a bit more detail to appreciate the true benefits of diversification . <p> What Goes up Can and Will Come Back Down <p> This is not an opinion , but rather a fact in reference to any holding . Let us assume for a moment that you are keen on short-term and ( potentially ) high-yield investments . Binary trades , CFDs and Forex pairs could be quite appealing . However , placing all of your assets in one financial " basket " will prove risky . Should a massive loss occur , you will be left in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those who regularly employ leveraged trades . Spreading your finances into other sectors such as blue-chip stocks , commodities and managed funds can help to offset such a situation . 5902 @qwx625902 <p> Sustainable Wealth <p> While there is no doubt that the major appeal of any investment is the capital return involved , the fact of the matter is that a number of different positions could be able to provide you with a source of sustainable wealth over time . This is actually the goal of many investors from the very beginning . Once again , pragmatism and prudence should always rise above " gut feelings " or shifting massive amounts of capital around into a single position . <p> It is a fact that the majority of single investments will sooner or later fail . Think of the recent housing crash or the price of gold between 2011 and 2015 . The values of both of these sectors fell massively and should you have only had holdings in these , your investments would have been severely damaged . This is another reason why diversification is so very important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , your other holdings will be able to make up for short-term equity losses . <p> What Next ? <p> Now that we have a basic understanding of the reasons why diversification is crucial , how are you to know where to place your finances ? The truth of the matter is that the answer to this question has just as much to do with your personal preferences as it involves the amount of funds that are available . However , here is a typical example which could help you to discover what works for you : <p> 20 per cent in blue-chip stocks . <p> 20 per cent in commodities such as oil or precious metals . <p> 20 per cent in up-and-coming domestic technology companies . <p> 15 per cent in managed funds such as pensions or an ISA . <p> 15 per cent in tangible assets such as property . <p> 10 per cent in liquid positions such as currency pairs . <p> This well-balanced example is diversified enough so that if a drop occurs in one sector , it could be nullified by a rise in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liquid positions equate to the smallest percentage of the portfolio . <p> Diversification is indeed the key to long-term financial success .

@@73220172 @1920172/ <h> 5 reasons why parallax scrolling is bad for your website <p> Parallax scrolling is one of the hottest web design trend of 2013 . However , I predict that we will start to see its slow demise in 2014 as there are too many problems with its implementation . If you have ever created or used websites with parallax scrolling , you will understand some of the issues . Below , I have listed out what I feel that negative aspects of parallax scrolling which in turn will drive web design back to other design forms . If you think I am wrong , I welcome any of your comments or feedback to the article . <p> Let the trolling begins ! <h> #1 : Parallax scrolling bad for SEO ? <p> I used a question mark here as the effects of parallax scrolling on SEO has not been studied in depth . However , we will lose some of the optimization options that a webmaster normally has with a regular website. 5902 @qwx625902 <p> No keywords in url : With parallax scrolling , you get only one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to work with . <p> No multiple H1 : You get only one H1 to work with in a typical parallax scrolling website . <p> Fewer internal links : Having everything on one page reduces the amount of internal links you can have control over . Believe it or not , internal links do pass anchor text relevance to the pages they are pointing to . <p> Slow : Speed is part of Googles ranking alogorithm . If you have too much content on one page , the loading is going to drag down the site speed which reduces the ability of the site to rank . <h> #2 : Difficult to track with analytics <p> Traditional websites allow you to track your visitors behavior with different landing pages . With parallax scrolling , it is difficult to know which section within a single page is providing the most value for your visitors . It is also difficult to implement any form of A/B testing for websites with parallax scrolling . <p> Without the proper analytics , a website owner can not improve its web pages or content to improve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increases load time <p> Parallax scrolling requires some computation for the jquery script . The more content you have , the longer time the script needs to calculate where everything should go to . For users on a slow Internet , a parallax scrolling website will be seen as crawling . This ca n't be a good user experience so we should seriously think about when and how best to use parallax scrolling . <h> #4 : Parallax scrolling does not work on mobile devices <p> With mobile browsing becoming more prevalent , we cant afford to use a website design that makes it unusable on mobile devices . Unfortunately , that is what happens when you use parallax scrolling . Currently , there are codes that can make a parallax scrolling website work on mobile but it is not free . This problem might be solved in the future but for now , it is still something that can drag a website down its useability index , especially when used on mobile devices . <h> #5 : Lack of navigation makes it annoying to browse <p> Sometimes , it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the page to find the information I need. - Some smarter designs used some anchor links but it is still annoying to fly throw all the unnecessary stuff to get to the things that I want to read or know. - All these problems boil down to the lack of good navigation design on parallax scrolling websites . Most of them just uses the down arrow as the sole navigation method , which frankly , does n't  work well. - The first time you are using it might seem nice but using such a website repeatedly will inevitably cause you to wish there was a faster way to navigate . <p> So , what is your views on parallax scrolling ? More harm than benefit or vice versa ? 5901 @qwx625901 5903 @qwx625903 <h> Subscribe to Smashing Hub <h> Related Articles <h> 17 Comments <p> A lot of our clients actually want one pagers or parallax type pages for tablet browsing . Its much easier to keep everything in one page and let the end user stay there . Drop down menus are a nightmare on phones and tablets . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but there is still a lot of life left in one pagers . Its just a matter of keeping the content fresh and exciting within the sections of the page . <p> 1 . Not to be a bugger , but with HTML5 you can actually have more than one H1 on the page . You can actually implement best practices for SEO in a one pager . Because were talking about one pagers not parallax here . <p> 2 . Speed is not an issue if you load content progressively via JS <p> 3 . What is this ? " Currently , there are codes that can make a parallax scrolling website work on mobile but it is not free . " You 're kidding , right ? Any decent coder can implement parallax and one pagers that work in any modern browser . <p> 4 . A decent designer can work out " reveal " type areas and use other techniques to prevent as much as possible scrolling for information . The menu is not an issue , most of them have a decent menu that 's sticky and easy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am not saying these issues are impossible to resolve . Any smart developer can find solutions to almost any web design problems . However , most of the current implementation did not resolve most of these issues . <p> I would love it if you can contribute a list of website that uses parallax scrolling which uses what you have recommended . <p> If have to agree with the commenter above . Your post does n't  really condem parallax at all . Its more like good advice to designing any web site , one page or not . <p> 1 . Parallax has nothing to do with SEO , as parallax is only a design ( read look and feel ) element on the page . <p> 2 . Analytics can be attached to damn near anything now . <p> 3 . True that parallax is purely visual and needs to considered , but I 'd argue that that agreement is a consideration in the larger argument embodied in the general page weight of any site . <p> 4 . Parallax if done right ( and its easy to do with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ device . Any HTML/JS/CSS can go wrong if not planned and implemented correctly . <p> 5 . Having accessibility to navigation should be a constant concern of any web-based design . There are numerous methods to implement that accessibly and reliably . <p> So I 'm still left wondering why you are saying Parallax effects will become a declining trend . As Parallax effects are visually design related , do you have some more targeted reasons that the actual design pattern should be abandoned ? <p> We tried developing a Parallax Scrolling Mobile website recently for a client but the loading time killed the clients desire to have a fancy mobile website . Instead we rolled back to a regular vertical/responsive design . We 've noticed that when it comes to E-Commerce Website Designs , the loading time is very critical and design companies need to pay extra attention to Page Speed Optimization . <p> In fact , we get so many projects for website re-design where the client has an existing website with tons of JS/CSS written where only a paragraph is actually being used and probably a novice designer has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ functionalities . <p> Ill start by saying I agree with most of the points that were brought up . But want to point out that there is a use case for Parallax Scrolling websites though . <p> It allows you to better control the user experience , and the order they see information . If well developed it will outperform a traditional website ( if conversions is the primary goal ) . This of course makes a few assumptions . #1 , Most visitors are new customers , not existing customers #2 , Your primary goal is getting conversions . <p> okay , I also do n't  agree with " #2 : Difficult to track with analytics " . With tools like Google Analytics its very easy to implement manual reportings to the analytics dashboard , enables to track which sections were clicked or scrolled by a visitor . More work to implement , but not impossible . <p> For some people this maybe already boring , but not for all . this trend has been around for more than 2 years now . As I do agree with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generalization that this type of design will fade away , since it does suite for some types of websites <p> I have very often wondered about this and I agree with all the above . Initially it was something cool and I liked a few sites but I got bored of it quickly . Many unexperienced people will still pick the most modern design style over functionality . I still personally have clients asking for flash !

@@73220175 @1920175/ <h> Blend Color Trends and Flat Designs Perfectly <p> As we have mentioned in our previous articles , one of the latest trends in web design world is of Flat Design . This trend is being followed all across the globe and is being appreciated as well . People have had enough of designing that included almost every possible thing available for designing . Like I always say , if you are creative enough , you can make a simple design look attractive and this is exactly what our current designers are finally doing . Yes , we can finally put our eyes to some rest by looking at flat yet attractive designs . This article inspired through Designmodo Blog . <p> If you want to work on a flat design yourself , you must keep in mind one of the most important part of this trend i.e. , color palette . Colors play a very important role is almost everything and same goes for websites as well . Your website will look pleasing to the eye only if it has a good combination of colors . Selection and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ color combinations should compliment your designing as well . Keeping a balance of designing and colors is never an easy thing . Let us recall what flat designing means and then we will move on to discussing color palettes for websites . <h> Flat Design : <p> Precisely , flat design is a process in which designers ' uses simple techniques with simple effects . A flat design does not contain any three-dimensional attributes . Any kind of effect or gradient is avoided in Flat Designing . If you look at it , the entire look of flat design can come across as very simple however ; designing a flat design can be very complex as well . I personally think that the best thing about flat design is that the look is way too simple , which makes it user friendly . This is one of the major reasons behind its popularity . <h> Identifying Perfect Color Palette : <p> As I mentioned earlier , you need to be careful with your color selection when it comes to flat design . A lot of variation can be added but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bright colors . <p> Earlier , flat designing was had no more than 2 colors however , the good thing is that designers are now finally expanding palettes and they are using 3-4 colors ; sometimes more . Mostly the bright colors are seen that are mixed with grays and blacks to keep a good balance . <p> What I personally love about the flat design and color palettes is that designers are no longer following the traditional rules of color combinations . They are making new combinations and using a lot of new colors here and there hence , making the websites look great . <p> If you have a good color sense , I am sure you will notice that flat designs of today are a good balance of tone and saturation . Designers select each and everything very carefully and they make sure to mirror shades . If you are a designer , I will always recommend you to experiment in order to become a trend setter . However , if you are planning to play it safe , you should follow trends i.e. , being more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have read above , bright colors are now being associated with simple and flat designing in order to create a diverse feel . The best thing about bright colors is that they will work perfectly with a light background or a dark background . This keeps the balance and created a great contrast of colors which obviously looks very pleasing to the eye . As of now , you should consider this to be the biggest trend in flat designing . <h> For beginners : <p> If you are a beginner , I would strongly recommend you to visit FlatUIColors.com since it offers a huge list of the most famous shades used in flat designs . This website is a perfect guide for you to learn if you should use a bright blue or you should go for greens and yellows . The best thing about this website is that they allow you free of cost downloading of a color . So , you can download your favorite color and see if this is something that your site needs . <p> Designmodo has gone one step ahead by releasing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bright colors however ; it comes with a great interface kit as well . I think this is the best option for anyone who is not very good with mixing colors or who has just gotten into this field . <p> I think it is very wise of designers not to use primary colors with bright color in flat designing . Just think for a minute that bright blue and a pure red can and will never make a great color combination as far as flat designing is concerned . If you want to go with your personally selected color schemes , I will recommend you to keep things as simple as you can . You should go for colors with the same color tones and- saturation . <p> Popular colors : Blues , greens and purples <h> Retro Color Schemes : <p> My personal favorite and yes a well-liked and poplar choice of designers when they are working on flat design projects. - Retro color schemes are less saturated however , the usage of bright colors is still there but they are mixed match with light tones such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ schemes are yellow , red , orange and a few more . When it comes to retro color schemes , you will see a lot of usage of primary and secondary colors . <p> Popular colors : - Oranges , peach or plum tones and dark blues <h> Monotone Color Schemes : <p> This kind of color scheme is gaining popularity like anything in the world of flat designing . In monotone color palettes , designer basically relies on a single color that is combined with a perfect combination of black and white . Basically the single color is used as a base color and 1-2 colors are used for further effects . This color scheme is particularly popular for mobile apps . <p> Popular colors : - Blues , grays and greens <h> Conclusion : <p> Since the flat designing trend is actually new , it is getting interesting and fun with every passing day . Always be sure to come up with a color palette that compliments your project . 5901 @qwx625901 5903 @qwx625903

@@73220196 @1920196/ <h> Reseller hosting not just for resellers <p> This may come as a surprise to some , but reseller hosting can come in handy for your own personal use as well . You do n't  have to plan on selling space to other people in order to make use of this type of hosting account . This short guide will explore a few of the main reasons why you may consider doing this yourself . <h> Security and Segmentation <p> If you are running multiple domains and websites on a shared hosting package , or just about any other type of hosting , they are all sharing a single control panel and file manager . In this type of setup , the security risks are higher for all of your sites . There is one single point of entry which opens up a hole in to your entire operation if someone manages to compromise your control panel . <p> On the other hand , all of the popular reseller hosting packages available these days offer you the ability to create dozens of separate accounts to keep everything more secure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harm to your websites , they must find the login details of each one of your websites . <h> More Server Resources <p> As a general rule , reseller hosting accounts are placed on physical servers that have more , and better quality , resources to keep your websites running smoothly . For example , many shared hosting plans on offer today will state that they support unlimited domains . Some even state that they have unlimited bandwidth and data storage . While this may be true in theory , it often does n't  work out well . 5902 @qwx625902 <p> When you start putting more and more websites and domains on to that shared hosting account , you are going to run in to problems eventually . There is only so much RAM , CPU , and other resources to go around . <p> In contrast , reseller accounts usually have more of all of these resources , and higher quality hardware . There are also less users on each physical server . This is only a general rule though , so you should always check the plan details @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <h> Easier to Manage EV SSL Certificates <p> If you would like to use multiple EV ( Extended Validation ) SSL certificates " one for each domain " then you will need a unique IP address for each . While it is sometimes possible to buy addon IP addresses for a shared hosting account , it is not available from all providers . With a reseller hosting package you can almost always buy the necessary extra IP addresses , which can cost as little as $1 per month depending on your provider . <p> Without these unique IP addresses , all of the websites on a shared account must also use the same shared SSL certificate . This may not be a big deal for some website owners , but others like the perks of an EV SSL certificate such as having their company name prominently displayed in the address bar of browsers . <h> Hiring Outside Help <p> For those who run many different websites , it is always a struggle to dedicate enough time to each one individually . If you are using a reseller account , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ panel of one of your websites to someone you have hired to maintain and manage the website . Maybe you have gone on vacation and you receive an alert on your phone telling you that your website is down . No problem , you can simply ask a friend or pay a professional to login to only the affected website to fix the problem . <h> Selling Websites <p> Even if you love your website as if it was your own cute little pet right now , you never know what could happen in the future . If you decide at a later point that you wish to sell one of your websites , you can provide the individual login details to the buyer . <p> This means they will be able to make a backup for themselves , and use any of the other features of the control panel , without the possibility of affecting your other websites . Or you may even want to keep them on your hosting and charge them appropriately . <h> All In One Monthly Bill <p> Instead of having the need to setup @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your growing group of domains and websites , consider getting a reseller account that can grow along with you . Hosting providers love it when you outgrow your current situation and will be more than happy to upsize your reseller account , at a price of course . This streamlined billing process means that you only have one single bill to remember each month . <p> As you can see , there are quite a few good reasons why many people decide to use a reseller hosting package for themselves , regardless of whether they plan to actually resell anything . At the end of the day , it just makes running your online empire that much easier , while also providing more security between all of your websites. 5901 @qwx625901 5903 @qwx625903

@@73220198 @1920198/ <h> Successful Website Design " The Devil Lies in Innovative Ideation <p> As a web experience specialist , working with a web design agency , I have worked on a range of website design projects . Each client asks for groundbreaking designs and they are perfectly entitled to do so , but the problem lies in the fact that such designs do n't come easily to a designer , and I speak from many years of experience . <p> Great designs are about even greater ideas and as we all know ideation is a difficult job and if we add the word innovative ' to it , it becomes even more difficult . But , if there is a job to be done , it needs to be done . <p> So , let me tell you how I go about IDEATING to bring forth the most unique , the most credible and the most effective online design experience for clients and end users alike . <p> Before I begin , it 's important to underline the fact that purely having an innovative idea is never enough ; you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the execution of the idea . 5902 @qwx625902 <p> Now that we have got that out of the way , let 's get started . <h> First , it 's the Conceptualization <p> It all begins here . What I do is I try to identify the various sources that I can use to generate ideas . I choose sources pertinent to the project requirement . After that I do extensive brainstorming and bounce my ideas off other designers and the marketing guys . All this time , throughout the whole process of idea conceptualization , I make it a point to focus on a specific GOAL . <p> Ideation is all chaos , but if you want to bring a sense of organization to this chaos , then you need to undertake goal oriented ideation , and think about which is that one idea which is innovative and which will help achieve your goal . <h> Consumer Oriented <p> A website design that makes everyone crazy over it is nice is n't ? Wrong , an interesting idea is one thing , and it is worthy of your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your target audience is going to consume your website . So , your idea should be such that it is consumption friendly . It should get the message out there and make it work . Remember , purely interesting ideas do n't work ; it 's those that have a resounding impact on the consumer that works . I make it a point to marry two important aspects consumer orientation ' and user interest ' , in my idea . <p> For me , that is the essence of a great idea . <h> New Ideas by reworking the old Ones <p> There are times when I work in a pressure cooker situation wherein I have very little to think of new ideas . I think all of us at some point or the other have worked under tremendous pressures , especially with respect to time . But the attempt to find a new idea can not be sacrificed just because , you do n't have enough time . <p> Here 's an idea for you , instead of thinking of a new idea , why do n't you dig @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your old notes , and take a look at all those discarded wireframes , and search for something that you think fits into the conceptual parameters of your project . <p> What you essentially need to do is improve an idea that is already there , refine it , fine tune it , modify it , and improve its potential to be innovative . <h> Choosing the right idea <p> All said and done , there are plenty of ideas that must be floating in your mind , what you need to do is pick the one that suits your needs and requirements best . It 's not all about the innovation quotient of your idea , it is also about whether you can sift through all the ideas in your head and pick the right one . <p> How do you do that ? You need to keep things simple . It must be the kind of idea that is sustainable and around which an internet marketing campaign can be woven . But above all , it should be the kind of design that can be brought to life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it must be feasible . Not going overboard with your imagination is the key here . There have been countless incidents wherein I have frozen on a nice little idea , only to be told by the development team that they can not build the design in its entirety . This meant that the essence of the concept was lost . <p> Major heartbreak for me and my team ! <p> But the key is to not lose heart , and modify the design in order to suit the parameters of development . <h> Innovative Ideation and the Devil <p> The devil is always in the details is n't it ? Well , when it comes to bringing forth innovative ideas , a case can also be made for the devil , in this case this being the worth ' of the idea . The ideation must be worthy of the client 's project and therein lies the devil . This is where you need to make your thinking , creativity , expertise and experience count . If you do n't , you have had it . <p> If you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of effective ideation . Expertise is one thing , but if you do n't focus on ideas , say goodbye to any chances of getting a successful website design off the ground . 5901 @qwx625901 5903 @qwx625903

Then circular design came along and all of a sudden , everyones photo is now wrapped in a circular frame . Which is actually better ? The answer is of course : it depends . There are different factors a designer should consider before deciding to go with a squarish or circular profile picture design . There is no one best scenario whereby it should always be square or circle . In the article below , I try to highlight out some of the factors you should consider and how they can affect your user behavior. <h> #Criteria 1 : For interaction on mobile or PC <p> If you intend users to click on the profile images as a form of interaction , then it is important to use different designs for different platforms . A circular design is preferred for touch based devices because circles are optimized for our fingers . A circular design emulates our fingers and thumbs , thus making it easier for user to click @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a PC , then a square design is preferred as it is better optimized for a mouse click. - The rectangle shape makes it easier for a user to guide the mouse over the right click-able area , relative to a circular design . 5902 @qwx625902 <h> #Criteria 2 : For information or asking for input <p> If you intend the image to just convey information like a persons face , then a circular design is not a bad choice as it focuses the eyes on the facial features . However , if you want users to fill in information after viewing the image , a square design tends to lead to more actions due to the use of edges to point users to the right area . <h> #Criteria 3 : Does it fit well with the rest of the website <p> Circular design might look more trendy but does it fit well with the rest of the design on your website ? Do remember that profile pictures are just one element of a design . It is more important to ensure consistency among all the design elements rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 4 : Does it help users to differentiate the content from the profile <p> One good use of a circular design is to help users to differentiate between the content and profile. - Using distinct shapes can help a website differentiate its different parts . For example , square design can be used for the content while a circular design can be used for only profile information . <h> #Criteria 5 : Can you combine both for a different design <p> Rather than deciding to go with square or circle , why not experiment with combining both designs for a complete distinct look . You never know what you will get if you do n't  try a little experiment here and there . For example , you can design a rectangular shape with some curves to emulate both types of designs . 5901 @qwx625901 5903 @qwx625903

@@73220209 @1920209/ <h> Flat Design VS Metro UI Trend Examples <p> While designing a website , every designer has his own creative style of doing it . However , some designers go for flat designing and some go to modern designing . Today , we will analyze both kinds and analyze which one is better and why . So , let 's start with flat designing <p> In the early years of website designing , flat designs were the only way to go . The reason could be lack of variations . However , now that we have a lot of new and creative ways to design a website , it looks like that flat designs are back in trend . I have witnessed this trend being adopted by every other website and even mobile applications . I will give the credit to Windows 8 and of course the new design of Google for giving hype to flat designing . <p> Now just because the design is flat , it does not mean it will be dull . Also , most designers think that they should add lots of embellishments to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This point of view should be changed now as sometimes less is more . ' <h> Concept of Flat Design : <p> Precisely , flat design is a technique in which no added effects are used to make a structure excluding three-dimensional attributes . Like I said , it is not dull even when it is without any drop shadows or added effects . Elements and icons used are pretty simple yet attractive . So , precisely , flat design is more real and original and it does not have any artificial effects to attract viewers . The designs that are simple are normally called flat designs . <h> Flat Designing Techniques : <p> Flat design is minus all decorations and fake- beautification- When it comes to flat designing , color scheme plays a very important role . In fact , it wo n't be wrong of me to quote that color plays an integral part in making a flat design look beautiful . A very important thing that you can do to make your website look beautiful is to select colors from your logo and use them throughout your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theme . <p> Apart from colors , since your website will be simple , typography should really pop-out . Also , the font is important because the words used are important . We all know that content is the king of any website . If you are keeping your website simple , try to be creative with typography . However , this does not mean that you should go overboard with the text . Make sure whatever font you select , it compliments your website . <p> Also , try to follow the minimalism theme and keep the content precise and crisply . <h> Simple UI elements and Icons : <p> Avoid over-designing your buttons or icons . They should be simple and easy to click . All you need to make sure is that the design of UI elements and icons is simple , self-explanatory and effective . <h> Flat hierarchy : <p> Hierarchy is of course very important for any website . So , create a plain hierarchy and make navigation easy for users . Do not make things complicated and user should not be having unanswered questions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be clear and understandable . <p> Now that we have talked about Flat designs , let us take a look at Modern designing . <h> Examples of Flat ' in Web Design <h> Concept of Metro UI : <p> Modern or Metro UI is basically a new design language which is gaining popularity after the launch of Windows 8 . Although , modern user interface was initially used with Windows7 portable devices but after windows 8 , it has caught attention of designers . Precisely , modern Ui design is all about stunning typography . It has less do with graphics and other related stuff . <p> The main focus of Modern UI design is to improve readability of users and bring a neat , crisp website to the forefront . When it comes to modern UIs , you will see a lot of grid layouts and usage of sans-serif . Since we are quoting Windows 8 as an example of Modern UI , I would like to mention here that a modern UI will not focus on graphical buttons and flashy images . It will focus on content even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reluctant about Modern UI initially as they thought focusing solely on content was not a smart move .

There are a lot of free advice out there but I thought of contributing some tips that are not mentioned often . Most of these tips require your time and effort but they are FREE in terms of putting up any monetary value. - Best of all , some of these tips can bring recurring sales once the initial set up has been done . If you have tried doing some of the stuff mentioned below , I would love to hear your comments and experience about what you did . I am sure the community will appreciate these kind of real world sharing . <h> #1 : Be a niche authority of social sharing sites <p> I see a lot of designers hanging out on sites such as dribbble.com but they are not making full use of the platform . One , you need to be niche focus . If you post any and everything that tickles your fancy , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in any areas . Two , learn how to use keywords when you upload your work to these sites . Search engine trusted these social sharing sites and will rank them higher in their search results . If you use the right keywords for your uploads , do n't  be surprised to see a constant flow of search traffic to your social media account , which you can channel to your sale funnel eventually . <h> #2 : Have an active design blog <p> A blog is still the best way to gain organic traffic and attract the eyeballs of future potential customers . The key is whether you have the discipline to maintain it on a regular basis . If you build something to the size of smashinghub , I can assure you that you will have potential customers knocking on your doors almost every week. - If you decide on this route , remember to pick a niche . Too general a blog will dilute any niche branding you can create for yourself . 5902 @qwx625902 <h> #3 : Do n't  just guest post , be a regular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a blog from scratch , you can try to become a regular guest contributor to a popular blog . The keyword here is REGULAR . Current guest posting practices are mostly one off as they only wanted a link for their effort . What you want is so much more . You want to establish yourself as an authority on a subject through frequent article contribute . The key your is to leverage the blogs traffic to get your name out on a consistent basis . This is how brands can be built . It can not be done if you are thinking of just 1 guest post per blog . Think monthly or even weekly . <h> #4 : Offer to maintain or change a website for free <p> What you are looking for here is the ability to work with some up and coming bloggers in a particular niche that you want to serve . Avoid the established ones as they will be too big to work with you . Once you manage to get hold of a list of blooming bloggers , approach them to provide a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do a good job as bloggers tend to blog about how good their site looks now thanks to you . Since their audience will be in the same niche that you want to serve , some of them will approach you to do some work as well . <h> #5 : Offer classes on how to set up website <p> I have seen this being done by a real person . He went around a business park area and start posting his free classes on how to set up a website . Guess what ? People do turn up and he really did teach them the basics for free . Eventually , some turn to him for further customization work because they knew and trusted the guy . This is one easy way to attract potential customers without being spammy or deceptive . <h> #6 : Be useful in niche related forums <p> Forums are places where people ask lots of questions about the things they want but can not accomplish . If you are specializing in designing , say music websites , go hang in music related forums . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Instead , participate in the forums as a normal music lover . If there are any questions that forum members have regarding website and/or design , volunteer a VERY solid answer and expect nothing in return . Over time , your reputation within your potential customer will grow and sooner or later , they will approach you with their web development or design needs . <h> #7 : Create an ebook and give it away for free <p> Creating an ebook is about establishing yourself as an authority . In this day and age where design services are plentiful , your potential customers need to know you are THE expert in this area . Nothing beats having a well written ebook in an area of your specialization so that potential customers who read it are convinced that they should use your service because you are THE authority . By upping your status , you are a step above everyone else in this value chain . <h> #8 : Give away a free theme and provide customization service <p> Giving out free wordpress theme is a great way to create @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theme and make it available on those free theme websites . Then create a mini site with lots of faqs related to your theme so that your free theme users can find this mini site when they want to search for something related to the theme .

There is a caveat , though " one which web designers will be all too familiar with . Especially if you use a video for your entire background , you run the risk of rendering your site virtually unusable for those who use outdated browser versions or have slow internet connections . Grappling with this is a hard reality of website design , so be sure to make an informed choice about animations based on your target audience . 5901 @qwx625901 5903 @qwx625903

@@73220246 @1920246/ <h> Who should use what : WordPress vs CMSMS <p> CMS Made Simple ( CMSMS ) is a free , open source ( GPL ) content management system ( CMS ) created to provide developers , programmers and site owners a web-based development and administration area . It is a up and coming alternative CMS to the popular WordPress CMS . In this article , we will see what are the main differences between these two types of CMS and which one is a better fit for your need . <p> If you have any experiences , I would love to read about them . <h> Flexible Development CMSMS <p> If you are a developer who desires flexibility , then CMSMS is a better choice as you need to jump through less hoops imposed by other CMSs . CMS Made Simple is intended to offer easy development and customization with themes , add-on modules , dynamic menus , tags and translations . However , to get the best out of CMSMS , you need to learn some of the best practices instead of the usual practice of just slapping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rigid structure that constraints the kind of things you can do without going through a lot of effort to fit into the framework . <h> Less learning curve WordPress <p> It goes without saying that WordPress has definitely a less steep learning curve , especially for a designer . If you want to use CMSMS , you need to overcome a new templating language called Twig . This can be time consuming , depending on how fast you- can usually pick up stuff . <h> Light weight site CMSMS <p> If you want a light weight site without all the necessary codes for functions you will never use , CMSMS is definitely a better choice . It compliments your front end pretty well so that there is no unnecessary code to slow down the loading or performance of the site . <h> Plugin community WordPress <p> One of the major downside of CMSMS is the lack of a strong plugin community like what WordPress has . This means you probably need to code more stuff yourself since there is no existing plugin to do the job for you. - One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relative to WordPress so it is lacking behind . It might catch up in the future as more developers desired the benefits of CMSMS and start to develop more plugins for it . <h> Handing different content types -CMSMS <p> The default content type in WordPress is either pages or posts . You can always customize the template using custom post but it is adding a lot of unnecessary codes to your base . CMSMS , on the other hand , has clearly thought out how different content should be handled and more importantly , how one type of content relates to one another . It is hard to put this into words until you have tried out how CMSMS actually handles the management of different content types . <h> Free WordPress <p> WordPress has one powerful thing going for it which is the fact that it is free to download and installed . In contrast , CMSMS will cost you $299 . Free is a pretty tough thing to beat especially for designers or developers who do n't  usually like to spend so much on tools. - ( I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free resources LOL ) . <p> Through this , I know you will be more able to understand which particular CMS is more suited for your needs . 5901 @qwx625901 5903 @qwx625903 <p> LEARNING CURVE I would not claim WP has less steep learning curve , both systems are equally easy to understand for a regular site manager , but for a front-end developer one has to have some grasp about PHP to be able to handle WP twmplating , well at least if you want to do decent custom work and not simply edit some template , where with CMSMS one is using Smarty which completely separates core functions from frontend views , even if one does n't  know Smarty it is fairly easy to learn if you take some time and read Smarty documentation at smarty.net . <p> @Philip it does n't  really matter which system is best , actually comparing WP with CMSMS is like comparing apples with bananas , but what is more important , choose best tool for current task or project , simply put use tools that fit best for your current situation without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something it was n't intended for . <p> Thank you for your interest in CMS Made Simple which is for me the best CMS for the end user and for the developer/integrator . <p> Just to correct some errors : <p> SMARTY CMSMS uses Smarty and not Twig as template engine . Sure , you need to know Smarty , but its quite easy even for a non-developer , and gives great tools/plugins to every designer . <p> PLUGINS Sure , WordPress has more plugins , but as a CMSMS designer , most of the time I do n't  need to develop something specific to manage a company website : news , calendar , forms , lists of everything ( team , files , FAQ , or what you need ) , GMaps , sliders , image gallery everything already exists in the 500 modules existing , and Smarty gives you the power to design it as you want . <p> COST CMSMS is totally FREE I do n't  know where you get the cost of $299 but its not right you just have to go to http : **34;350;TOOLONG and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that for that last point , WordPress and CMSMS are equal

@@73220259 @1920259/ <p> From the small unmarked bills requested by bank robbers to the valuables stuffed into a canvas sack with a giant dollar sign on it beloved by old-timey train robbers , criminals have long had preferences for the way they receive their ill-gotten gains . Just because a great deal of of financial crime has moved online lately does n't mean this has changed . Offenders still have their preferences , especially when it comes to DDoS extortion . <h> Details of DDoS <p> A DDoS attack is a distributed denial of service attack , an online attack that seeks to overwhelm a targeted website 's bandwidth or network resources and take it offline . A DDoS attack does so using the services of a botnet , which according to DDoS mitigation services provider Imperva Incapsula is a grouping of internet-connected devices that have been hijacked by malware so an attacker or attackers can control the devices without the owners knowing . Botnets are used to create a major influx of malicious traffic that overwhelms the target website 's bandwidth or network resources to accomplish the goal of knocking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ denial of service attack was something that major corporations and big-time online businesses had to worry about . Like all fairy tales , that one came to an end and a DDoS attack is now a risk for every website from mom and pop shop businesses to Lord of the Rings fan sites . <h> The extortion angle <p> One of the main reasons distributed denial of service attacks have become so commonplace and a threat to anyone with an online presence is the propagation of DDoS for hire services , otherwise known as booters or stressers. 5902 @qwx625902 <p> Not only is paying a small fee in order to access a botnet and launch a DDoS attack a cheap and easy way for anyone to grind an axe against a competitor or enemy , but it also provides an opportunity for entrepreneurs to make a little extra money by sending a distributed denial of service attack ransom note to a website owner demanding payment in exchange for not launching an attack . <p> It is n't just booter and stresser users using ransom notes to earn a little extra @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their businesses on distributed denial of service ransom notes . The group DD4BC " distributed denial for Bitcoin " has been in action since 2016 and even arrests of some of the members have n't slowed them down . <p> A recent survey undertaken by Incapsula showed that 46% of distributed denial of service attack victims receive a ransom note prior to the attack . And while organizations are understandably unwilling to admit they have paid a DDoS ransom , groups like DD4BC are obviously garnering a substantial profit , otherwise they probably would n't be willing to risk prison time . <h> An internet king 's ransom <p> The ransom payments are often requested in the form of Bitcoin , a digital currency that was created electronically and is held electronically . Users have a Bitcoin wallet from which they can send or receive the currency , and signing up for the wallet does n't require the user to provide any personal information . Contrary to popular misconception , Bitcoin is not untraceable . In fact , transaction logs making all transactions visible are permanently stored in the Bitcoin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ details , disposable emails can be used for transactions , and users can scramble the user end of the recorded transactions , Bitcoin can be turned into an anonymous payment method . This makes it very appealing for cybercriminals . <p> A single Bitcoin is currently worth approximately $575 USD , and the ransoms demanded typically range between $575 and $25,000 . If these seem like insane sums to pay to avoid a distributed denial of service attack , keep in mind that an unmitigated DDoS attack can cost an organization $40,000 per hour . <h> Ransom note dos and don'ts <p> The key to successfully dealing with a distributed denial of service attack is being prepared before you ever even get one . That means having professional DDoS mitigation . If you 're prepared for a DDoS attack you do n't have to care when a ransom note rolls in beyond warning your response team . <p> If you do n't have protection in place when the note comes in , it is n't too late to onboard protection . Most ransom note issuers will fire a warning shot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a very small attack that serves to prove the person or people behind the note have the ability to launch an attack . You have time to get protected before the big one . <p> Regardless of whether you have protection or you do n't , do not reply and do not pay the ransom . Paying up will merely mark your website as an unprotected target , one that can be hit up again and again . <p> Just as you would have loathed to drop your jewels in a dollar sign bag , you should abhor the idea of sending Bitcoin across the internet to the nameless faceless attackers that get rich off the backs of the unprepared . 5901 @qwx625901 5903 @qwx625903

In actual below are the major possible benefits of using CSS for SEO . <h> Making the page lighter and fast loading <p> The main purpose for using the CSS is to make the pages load faster by minimizing the server requests and images . This increases the website opening speed and make it more efficient for search engines to be crawled . This ultimately results in quick and better indexing of your sites content . <h> Using search engines- recognized- standard tags <p> There are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Make them more prominent and visible using CSS .

Using this method one can show important content first on the website using CSS to returns the important paragraph first but not to users . This is not that effective now but in terms of easily- crawl-ability . <h> Best CSS Practices that aids SEO <p> For WordPress users , many things are done automatically in SEO like if you 're using some good reputed WordPress theme then solves half of the hurdles . Below are some good practices that can help you add more value to your SEO practices . <h> 1- CSS Sprite <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ page load and faster web-page loading speed . Google page speed emphasis every website developer to use the CSS sprites to minimize the server load and help the web-pages load quicker . Let 's have quicker view on what CSS sprites does mean ? CSS sprites the name is little weird and misleading , they are not small images but one large image that contains different smaller images in it . With the help of CSS background position , we can show users specific part of the image . This way we can make hover buttons , images and icons . <h> Why they are important ? <p> Previously there was a conception that the smaller images will load faster for the users but that approach was wrong . By CSS sprites method , there will be only one HTTP request rather than multiple HTTP-request for each image which increases the response time . Once the main image is loaded completely , then that will be used in all over the website easily . <p> If you need a complete tutorial on what are CSS sprites , how they work and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ External CSS Files <p> Adding external files help web-pages load faster . When creating the web-pages , the developer have a choice to add in-line styles of to wrap them all in some separate file . The right choice is to go with external CSS files . The same rule applies for- JavaScript files . <h> Importance ? <p> Yeah right ask , they 're really important . First and most important importance is that you do n't  have need to write the same CSS code again and again in all over the pages . It saves the- developer from scratching the separate web-pages for a single color change . An amazing experiment- reveals that the external style sheets load way faster . This can also help you rank well in SEs on content to code ratio . <p> Another important benefit is that when you reload the pages the external files does not reload . This way the web-page even if reloaded will connect to already opened external CSS file which will boost the opening . <h> 3- Easily Crawl-able Content <p> Use the standard HTML tags to indicate SEs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than using fancy &lt;font&gt; tag . Further for creating menus and navigation , consider the standard menu tags &lt;ul&gt; and &lt;ol&gt;. and further the &lt;li&gt; and &lt;a&gt; elements to link to the other important pages of your website . The CSS thing is revolving around better crawling option . The content to code ratio ( In comparison how much is your code with content in a web-page ) should be well managed . SEs consider this a key factor while ranking websites . <p> The website with outdated HTML code can never be ranked well in the search engines because of less crawl-ability and complex invalid code . The bad and good examples are below . <h> Bad Example or Old HTML <p> 1 2 3 4 5 <p> &lt;bold&gt;&lt;font size= " 30px " color= " #eee " &gt; All about SEO and CSS **26;386;TOOLONG <h> Optimal and Recommended- HTML/CSS <h> Some bad practice to avoid <p> CSS can ruins your SEO at the same time if you 're using some spam techniques to cheat the SEs . Search engines have became way more intelligent than minute minds of spammers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <h> 1- Using CSS to Hide Text <p> This is one the technique that SEs treat very angrily . Can also be used for keyword stuffing . Any website that intentionally contain any hidden text to- deceive- the search engines may be removed from Google index and may not appear in search engines . Using display:none ; or margin : -999px like commands can hide the text from end users but seen by search engines . Using them will ruin your SEO practice if you 're using them to spam . <h> 2- Using CSS to replace images <p> Replacing images using CSS is a good way to show good designed image to users while a complete text to search engines . Mostly used in logo and tag-line part of website and blog . Below are a sample way to do so . <p> Using this technique is fine but this can be abused by stuffing a lot of keywords in the title and tag-line/description . Adding too many keyword will get your site spam and may be blocked by search engines . You must use this feature with good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get affected . <p> Another option is to use the alt tag on all images to let search engines know about the image content . <h> Summary <p> CSS is a lovely option which is adopted for creating up-to-date websites which are optimal in size so that load faster and to base on standards . Clean written code not improves your code to content ratio but helps the search engines to crawl your pages with more ease which ultimately results in better rankings . One can separate the HTML content from a lot in in-line code stuffing which makes the code way lighter , cleaner and faster which is purely search engine friendly with losing the design requirements .

@@73220334 @1920334/ <h> 10 jquery plugins for typography problems <p> Typography has been one of the biggest nightmares of the web designers and developers . As the websites are getting more and more interactive , static typographic features are becoming a thing of the past . Website owners now want text that not only coveys the message , but also attract the visitors . Now even though we now have a very versatile solution to this problem in the form of Google Fonts and Font Faces , we still lack some fine control over our text that we may desire . That 's where jQuery comes in . Thanks to the ingenuity of developers , we now have some interesting and extremely useful jQuery plugins to finely tune our typography . <p> These plugins can be used to give variety of effects to the text and in conjunction can be used to achieve intricate and subtle functionalities . And since they are made using jQuery , they can be effectively used to create websites that are compatible in all the most popular browsers and some of the popular old ones as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ list of top 10 jQuery plugins that will permanently change the way you code and use typography in your website . <p> It 's the age of responsive websites . And responsive websites require responsive texts . Fittext is just a plugin that allows the developer to create flexible text content that scales according to viewport . However the best part about this plugins is that it allows the text to scale down just like responsive images , i.e. the text just reduces in size instead of wrapping up and dropping in second line , like normal responsive text . So now you no longer have to confine to irritating wrapping that is evident in CSS responsive designs . However one immediate drawback that is evident is in the case when you deliberately want to wrap the text . For that , stick to the CSS itself . But overall Fittext is an ultimate plugin for creating mobile device compatible websites . <p> An extremely simple yet extremely useful plugin , Lettering.js allows you to precisely style each alphabet of a text . Using &lt;span&gt; tag between each letter you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each alphabet to get an entirely brilliant overall text effect . That means you can add separate CSS effects and CSS styling to each individual letter including color , animation , size and positions . This is one of the most popular tools and used my thousands of professional websites to create that unique website logo without an image . <p> Typebutter is a very unique plugin that allows you to alter the typographic kerning of the text . For those not familiar with typography jargon , Kerning is the space between each individual alphabet and word of the text . Or to be more exact the kerning is the proportional placement of an alphabet according to its predecessor alphabet so that the net result is more optically pleasing . By default the browser set the kerning standards but Typebutter plugin allows you to override the browser and change the kerning itself . Now you can argue that there are many such plugins what 's so special about this one ? Well Typebutter is extremely easy to use and unlike other plugins you do n't have to adjust kerning for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ text or desired portion of the text easily , like spreading butter . <p> As professional web developers we frequently get designs in which we have to arrange the text in a circular fashion . Words arranged in an arc are becoming a very popular design element . CSS allows developers to rotate alphabets but to arrange the text in an arc one would have to carefully rotate each alphabet and place it with precision so that the overall sentence will come out like an arc . It is a very hard process . Arctext.js allows the developer such feat very easily when compared to CSS styling . Using this plugin you can create circular text effects that arc around on a radius you define . You can even arrange the text in a full circular fashion ; useful for creating online stamps or logos . <p> As the name itself suggests , Kerning.js allows you to change the kerning of the text . But that 's not all ; this plugins has so many more features . You can use this plugins to not only change the kerning but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , apply transformations even to a single alphabet of the word , add conditional font size and font weight , highlight repeat alphabets or specific alphabet , and add some unique lettering styles . <p> Newspapers , and yes I am talking about the printed ones , have very unique typographic elements . And the most iconic of them all , one which we seldom notice , is the multi column arrangement of the text and how headlines small and large are arranged in the same column width as the rest of the text . Digital media on the other hand , especially in e-magazines and blogs , this feature is not incorporated as it is very difficult to manage . It is very difficult to arrange different font sized texts into roughly the same column width which is known in typographic terms as Measure . Hatchshow plugin is the solution to this problem . It allows you to arrange text of any size in roughly the same Measure . The best part of this plugin is that you can arrange the amount of text that goes in each line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the same measure . The larger the text line the smaller would be its size and vice versa . Very useful for creating attractive posters or old style magazine . <p> jqIsoText is a simple yet effective jQuery plugin to play with the text sizes . You can use this plugin to change the size of the alphabets of a word in a way that it would not seem out of place . It is very handy plugin to create eye catchy headlines or for creating text line that emphasize the meaning behind the words . <p> Till now we have talked about adding static effects to the text . Well here is a jQuery plugin that can add dynamic effects to the text . Textualizer is a great jQuery plugin than can be used to add transition animation effects to the text . This plugin can add Fade-in , Slide-Left , Slide-Top , and Random animation effects to alphabets , words , or the whole text . It is a simple yet highly effective plugin to give that extra emphasis to your text . <p> Slabtext is jQuery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and responsive headlines . The jQuery plugin splits the headline text into rows that are sized according to available horizontal space . The code automatically calculates the ideal number of characters to set in each row according to font size and divides the characters and words into neat text rows . But the best part is that the headlines created using this plugin are responsive and do not wrap around like CSS responsive text . It is like a mixture of Fittext and HatchShow plugins . <p> There are many time when you have to publish a curved image in between the text and thus have to leave an ugly rectangular space to adjust the image and text . It leaves a lot of blank space which is an eye sore . Bacon is a really simple jQuery plugin that allow you to wrap the text around a curved image . When said this way it may not sound very impressive but you will remember it when you have to wrap your text around a circular image or a wavy pattern . 5901 @qwx625901 5903 @qwx625903

@@73220337 @1920337/ <h> 10 Most Important Guidelines for Mobile Web Development <p> An immense development in the world of mobile devices has made things a lot easier for mobile users . With Android , iPhone and other Smartphone people are accessing internet simply from their mobile websites . As per a recent research , more than sixty three million people in States visited different mobile websites via their mobile devices and the count is expected to reach almost 2 billion by the end of next year . Since the numbers are growing like anything , it is very important for designers and developers to come up with websites specially designed for mobile usage . <p> Good thing about mobile web development is that as a developer or a designer , you wo n't have to make an extra effort to learn something out of the blue as far as technology is concerned , in order to develop a mobile website design . All you need to have is a whole new perspective regarding designing of the mobile website . Today , in this article I am aiming to sum up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way . So here goes : <h> Initiate with Analytics <p> It is extremely important to analyze a certain points regarding your mobile users ' . To start off with , review the stats of your OS . This will help you in analyzing the important and most visited web pages of your website . You will also get to know the country/city you are driving the most traffic from . Apart from analyzing the top pages visited by users ' , make sure you check the keywords being used in order to get an access to your site . These analytics will help you a lot in your mobile development and will definitely bring positive results . 5902 @qwx625902 <h> Visitors profiling <p> Mobile users are bound to have different needs altogether in comparison with desktop users . While developing and designing your mobile website , make sure you put yourself in the mobile user 's shoes . If your target audience is teenager , they will always be on the go so your website should be easy enough to use while driving , shopping or any other activity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ development . <h> Minimize the usage of images <p> Excessive usage of images is not considered to be a very practical act for mobile websites . In fact , images are considered to be a bad news for mobile websites and that too for the following reasons : <p> In general , images take a lot of time to load because of their large sizes . As a developer and designer , you must keep in mind that mobile users are often using slow internet connections and their connections can not handle download of heavy images . So , this is one good reason to avoid usage of images . <p> Each image will require a new HTTP connection and because of the latency it has , it will further slow down the loading of the page . <p> Sizing of the images for all kinds of devices can be very difficult due to the different resolutions . You are inviting a whole new lot of effort by including a lot of imagery in your mobile website . <p> Still , if you really desire to use images in your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helps in time reduction of loading . <h> Do not rely on JavaScript <p> Different mobiles will support different browsers and if you are developing a website to accommodate all of the browsers , you should not rely on JavaScript because mobile browsers are not very good with supporting JavaScript . Apart from this , mini browsers such as opera mini , also provide poor support to JavaScript resulting into a poor outcome . This issue is expected to get resolved in coming years thanks to Apple , Android and Blackberry devices . <p> Avoid drop-downs <p> While you are developing/designing a mobile website , make sure you avoid fly-outs and drop-downs in your website . This is a good thing but only for desktop websites since a user is able to move the cursor over any tab to view the drop down . Yes , a notch for dragging down can be used but then again , it is not a great idea for mobile websites . It would be a good idea if you do not use this thing at all . <h> Optimizing Download Speed with minimizing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not a reliable thing and if you want to increase the downloading speed of your website minify the JavaScript and CSS and it will automatically improve the downloading speed of your website . Also , minifying JavaScript and CSS should not be a difficult task so there should be no excuses for doing this . <h> Horizontal and Vertical Layouts <p> These days we see a lot of mobile websites supporting both horizontal and vertical layouts for the websites. - Yes , they work well for iPhone and Android devices but this is not practical for all Smartphone 's . While developing your website , you should go for a single column form . This will allow your users to scroll and that too in a single direction . By default , the single direction should be vertical because this is what is natural and a user expects this as well . If any images are being used , they too should support vertical scrolling . Opting for both vertical and horizontal scrolling is not a good idea . <h> Take advantage of mobile features <p> A great way to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ devices which are the most popular . You can then incorporate these features into your mobile website and this will be a definite plus for your website . <h> An option to visit your regular website <p> Mobile website is bound to have very limited information and in case a user requires more information , you can always provide a link of your regular website on the main page of your mobile web site . <h> Speed of your website <p> While developing your website , this is the most important thing to consider . Your site 's speed should be good enough to deliver website 's content quickly . If you want to achieve this , apart from avoiding JavaScript you need to avoid usage of flash as well . The most important guideline for mobile web development is to focus more on functionality and speed . 5901 @qwx625901 5903 @qwx625903 <h> 10 Comments <p> Good read , Humaira !

Do let me know if you guys have any topics/suggestions/ideas for such informative articles . <p> A good piece of information . Its the era of mobile and in US almost 70% mobile users browse web through their device . However , drop down menus are sometime very useful if designed perfectly . There are another point missed do not use flash for mobile websites . Business owners still need to be educated about mobile sites and optimization , as far I know they believe their site working well by visiting from smartphone browsers ! <p> Hey Bryan . I totally agree with your points . Flash for mobile sites should not be used as they make the entire website really slow . We will be having more relevant articles and will definitely be covering other important points . <p> A solid read , but I do n't  agree with you about avoiding dropdowns . I feel like with the minimal space it is a good and smart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ etc ) need to be featured and presented to the user . The space that dropdown menus like those can save is excellent for presenting additional content higher up on the screen for visitors and users to experience . Just my 2 cents <p> Hey Mike . Thank you for your suggestion and I agree with you to an extent . Drop-down menus are good but they need to be incorporated well within a website . The reason why I said that they should be avoided is that they do not render well on all mobile websites . Having said that , yes , they are a great way to save some extra space . <p> Great read . I really like the mention of utilizing mobile features . I 've recently developed and online app where we utilized the talk-to-text feature for smart phones for entering notes the user needs to store in the app . While mobile features vary greatly from one device to another , sometimes they are worth bringing into the process to simplify users experiences . 
@@73220339 @1920339/ <h> PPC marketing strategies that can kill your campaigns <p> The art of pay per click ( PPC ) marketing is one of the oldest and most preferred forms of internet marketing . With the ability to target who sees the ad and how ads are displayed , the modern PPC campaign is a far cry from the traditional , one-size-fits-all banner ads that everyone ignored from years past . Just about any business or brand can quickly begin generating results with a targeted and well-designed PPC campaign , but success is not automatically guaranteed . Below , well review several PPC marketing strategies that can actually kill your campaigns , waste your dollars and leave you feeling completely unsatisfied . <h> No Call to Action <p> The top companies know that in order to have a successful PPC campaign , a few important elements have to be a part of it . Perhaps most importantly , the need for a call to action in a PPC campaign is mandatory . When someone from search or social media clicks on your ad , how should they proceed ? Are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mailing list , or persuade them to watch a video ? Regardless of desired action , it should be integrated into the ad and the broader accommodations for the campaign . Many people use landing pages as a way to direct the actions of those who click ( instead of merely hoping theyll put two and two together ) . Without landing pages and calls to action , a PPC campaign leaves its audience lost in the wilderness in terms of how they should respond . <h> Maintaining Poorly-Performing Keywords <p> All too many brands set their PPC campaigns up and forget about them . While occasional monitoring may occur , the biggest way to kill the efficiency of a campaign is often overlooked . Not all keywords targeted by a given PPC campaign are guaranteed to perform equally . Initially , a PPC campaign should target a variety of different keywords and phrases , but sooner or later , it should become evident that not all of these keywords perform well . By getting rid of the clutter and reducing the number of bad keywords in the mix @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another PPC campaign , new keywords for your current campaign , or something entirely different . The true cost per click for a PPC campaign will be improved dramatically by ensuring that this occurs with every campaign . 5902 @qwx625902 <h> Celebrating Click-through Rates <p> Once a PPC campaign is launched the numbers begin rolling in , its easy to become excited about all of the clicks that are being generated . With PPC campaigns " despite the name " the true goal is conversions , not clicks . If 100 people click on your ad but 0 convert , then that is a waste of money and a far less preferable outcome to having 10 people click on your ad and 1 converting . Clicks are necessary and the pre-cursor for conversions , but a lack of conversions speaks volumes about something being wrong with the campaign . If this is not fixed , then it can be the death of your PPC campaign . CTRs can vary , but usually fall in between one-half of one percent to five percent : if your campaigns are not generating these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drawing board . 5901 @qwx625901 5903 @qwx625903

I did not know that we can charge our laptops with solar chargers . I have been used to for long driving and i remember that my laptop battery gets finished and my work got disturbed . Is they available on Amazon ? I would love to buy one of them . Thank you <p> I design portable power systems , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outstanding . The Voltaic cases are fully self contained , providing solar panel with integrated solar power storage battery pack . The battery provides several output options to support almost any laptop . The Brunton solar panels must be used in conjunction with a solar storage battery ( like the Brunton Sustain or Impel ) . Note that the Brunton Solo 7.5 battery pack was replaced in the Brunton catalog back in 2010 by the Sustain . Same functionality though store the solar panels power &amp; provide the voltage , power , &amp; connector your laptop needs . The SolarGorilla is the only other product I have heard of , but I have not had the chance to evaluate it . Anything less than 10W solar , 50 Watt-Hour storage , with multiple output voltages , is not going to be useful for portable laptop use . Hope this helps ! Thanks for posting this article . <p> I use the 26w solar panels and the Brunton Impel to bicycle tour and work from the road . Love it . Would recommend upgrading to the 52w solar panelmore expensive but will charge the battery more quickly .

Writing is a kind of creativity that is present in most people . Unfortunately , some people are n't able to identify this great ability . Or if they identify it , they do n't utilize it properly like getting training to polish it in an effective way . And people who identify and then utilize their ability are the lucky ones and they can get benefit out of that too . <p> Today 's topic is about web content writers who want to become an expert in their field , and also want to be liked by their readers . As we all know , no one is perfect in this world , but you can try your best to get as close as possible to the point of perfection . So in today 's post I will mention some guidelines for such writers who have a spark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because of lack of training . <p> So f you want to become one of the favorite and best writers , follow the rules mentioned below : 5902 @qwx625902 <h> Writing should be simple and Easy : <p> Having the best vocabulary is a very good thing no doubt , and when you use it , it leaves a very good impact on others , but only on those who can understand such high vocabulary . And those who ca n't understand , they 'll definitely not get you that what you really want to say . So as a web content writer , your readers will constitute every kind of a person so you should use simple and easy language which everyone can understand without any difficulty . In this way they can admire your writing and become yours fan too . <h> Avoid Monotonous Content <p> Nowadays everyone likes to have new and advance changes in each and everything . In other words , you can say that innovation has become a vital part of our lifestyle . So as a writer you should use innovative ideas to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing in the same manner on regular basis , your readers will get fedop from your writing very soon . So keep bringing new content and style in your writing to attract more readers . <h> Do n't Create Puzzles <p> Here creating puzzles means creating difficult and tough scenarios without any reason , just to attract the attention of your readers . But unfortunately , doing this way , you will end up irritating the reader and he will leave reading your article . So such things seem good in novels kind of things to create a dramatic scene . But in articles you should be clear-cut in writing your content , so that people finds it interesting to read rather running away by reading difficult scenarios . <h> Do n't follow Orthodox writing style <p> In writing profession , the thing that actually matters is your writing pattern and style . If readers will like your style of writing , they will definitely become your daily readers . So when you think of writing something , you should keep this thing in your mind that you are basically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like orthodox pattern of writing . And if you are not aware of the new writing style , then you should take training , or make the habit of writing articles of other people who write with a new style just to have an idea that how to write ! <h> Avoid writing Lengthy Paragraphs <p> The thing that actually irritates most of the people while reading any sort of thing is lengthy paragraph . I myself get irritated so much that I actually stop reading that thing because lengthy paragraph mostly detract your focus and that 's why you get irritated . Whereas internet readers are frequently looking for short but well informed paragraphs . So , what you need to do is to keep the paragraphs short and simple for the readers to understand easily . <h> Give importance to Grammar <p> One thing that will totally ruin your article even if it has the best information on the topic which the reader wants to have , is the grammatical error . Grammatical mistakes and spelling mistakes should be a big NO for you in the article . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a reader as it gives different meanings to every different reader . And above all it also destroys your image in front of your readers . So you should be very careful in writing about grammatical mistakes . <h> Do n't confuse your mind and creativity <p> Though innovation is a very good thing and even necessity in our lives , but sometimes some people are not able to adapt that much changes . And if they try to adapt new style of writing , they get confused and fail to produce their best . So you should not confuse your mind and creativity with new innovations , you should keep trying but never leave your style in which you are comfortable in writing . <h> Never copy others content and style <p> As a writer , you will only be able to write a good piece of art if you are writing it according to your inner voice . You should know very well that what and how to write . Even if you have to change your writing pattern every now and then , it should be according @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If you are impressed by someone else writing , you should definitely read and get an idea from that writing , but you should not use it as it is in your article . as in this way , you will be leaving a bad image on your readers , which you do n't want at all . <h> Always Value the Feedback <p> It 's a natural thing that if you are praised for whatever you have done , you feel very happy for that . In the same way as a writer , when your readers leave comment in the comment box about your article , you feel very proud that people are reading your material and giving their remarks . But sometimes remarks can be little bit demanding . Demanding in the sense that your readers want some change in your writing style which you should acknowledge and try to follow it . Because if you will completely ignore that what your readers demand , they will ultimately leave reading your articles . So you should give value to the feedback of your readers . <h> Never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a very good thing , but sometimes it makes people proud which is a very bad thing . So if as a writer , you become famous for your writing , even then you should give respect to your readers . You should never forget this thing that you have become known writer just because of these readers . So you should be down to earth at each and every stage of your career and make sure that your success never affects you and your writing . And above all your ego should not overcome your creativity at any cost . <p> Bottom Line Thoughts : <p> Writing is a very good way to express your feelings and thoughts and if you adapt writing as a profession , because of the talent you have , than you can do a great business . But the thing that actually matters is the effective utilization of your skills and ability and you can do that by getting training and following the tips as I have mentioned above . So in other words , writing no doubt is a great way to express @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the right way . 5901 @qwx625901 5903 @qwx625903 <p> I am agree with smashinghub .

It does not mean there is no room left for new comers , of course there are opportunities still need to be explored . Though , the freshmen usually have to strive in order to stand alone whereas ; the experienced ones are also now trying to come with novelty and uniqueness . So , in all of this it seems clear that you have to have an idea , long term availability of content and ability to work hard with patience . <p> Keeping the up to date conditions of online blogging industry trends in mind , I made an effort to combine must-do 7 things that can ensure the success and sustainability to a blogger . It is a must read for those who are planning to start or those who have started @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet . So , buckle up and let 's get started with exciting advising ride . <h> Find Your Own Spot <p> As mentioned earlier that there are a lot of different types of blogs out there . The list includes those who like to break news , others provide informative articles or commentary and there are corporate blogs . Talking about design industry one can find several different blog types , including : IT news , tutorials or in-depth articles . The numbers of blogs that overlap into different kinds are also quite a lot , but the important thing is everyone has developed some sort of role that keeps readers coming back for that specific role . <p> It is the very first question you need to ask that what role I am going to play if I have my blog . The important thing for every blogger is that he needs to find his spot among others and develops his say within the industry . Once you have developed your role the most important you need to do is to avoid replication . The mushroom growth of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should never be able to see the duplicity . 5902 @qwx625902 <p> In order to find your role , I would say start a blog with what you do and know best . Readers should be able to get benefit from your knowledge , experience and expertise . <h> Evaluate the Feedback <p> As a blogger you need to remember that your biggest asset is your readers because if they do n't like your blog you will never be able to move ahead . So , it means you have to keep their feedback and their need in mind while posting information on your blog . The key of successful bloggers is that they pay heed to their reader 's comments , feedback even criticism . <p> There are different ways which help you to determine your reader 's feedback . The most important is of course comments on the post , however ; you also need to look over the social media and evaluate what fans are talking about your blog . Google Analytics is also helpful in order to see which post is being raised high by readers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might be thousands of different things among successful bloggers but one commonality is that they are well connected. - Benefits of successful blog are directly proportional to contacts with influential bloggers . A well constructed close network of other bloggers can help your blog in countless ways , including link building , recommendations , guest posting opportunities , partnership opportunities and so on . <p> There are numerous ways of formulating a network of other industry members . It can be done through social media , email , IM , Skype , in person , or even simple blog comments . Do n't crave for successful people only because the difference in level makes it difficult for you to get access to them . Moreover , making more friends of your own caliber is more beneficial because it makes the relationship mutual . <h> Multiple Traffic Sources <p> Like said before , reader is your asset because this is the traffic you need without it success can not come even near to you . Traffic is something bloggers struggle and some give up in the search of it . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , audience or whatever you might name it , you have to develop diverse traffic sources that will drastically increase your chances for long-term success . <p> Traffic comes in through different sources . Once you have your blog people will start coming in , but to direct your traffic in certain way will give you a bonus point and long term success . So , focus on social media sites including StumbleUpon , Reddit , and Digg . <p> These sites have the ability of sending thousands of visitors in a short period of time . However , once you have your reader you need to make him stay for long because short lived traffic wo n't work all the time . <h> Long Term Sustainability Measures <p> Blogging is a test of patience , motivation and determination . It has been often witnessed that most bloggers fail because they give up . The prime reason for doing so is that the results do not come fast enough to keep them motivated . There comes a time when spending so much time or money in blogging does not seem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not yielding any profit and you run out of financial resources then you need immediate plan to cope with it . In order to avoid such dire circumstances you need to have sustainability plan beforehand . <p> So , there are few things you may like to consider while devising your sustainability plan . It includes identifying your goals behind your true motivation for blogging , establishing a posting schedule and setting hours aside to work on your blog . A fellow is doing this perfectly A blogger should also identify areas where he needs help from others in terms of content development or marketing and determining how the blog will generate income to keep itself functional . <p> It is possible to become successful blogger without this plan , however ; if you wo n't consider the above mentioned things you 'll probably fall into that large percentage of bloggers that start out with high hopes but fade quickly . But a plan to sustain may help you in enduring the struggling times . <h> Online Earning Opportunities <p> It is evident that without sufficient revenue it would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So , in order to sustain , work , reach the acme and earn money you need to think possible earning sources . The most important of all sources is advertising and AdSense . <p> Although there are other options available for a blogger to earn money for example , your monetization plan may have nothing to do with ads or selling products , instead you want to market your services through your blog . There are examples when some bloggers have even used their blogs to seal book deals which show another possibility to earn . <p> The good blog is always potential to earn quite a lot of money and over the period of time the new marketing techniques help the blog grows financially stronger . <h> Keep Yourself Unique <p> Uniqueness is one thing that will always serve in your best interest . Never say no to creative , new and unique ideas because they can give you success like no other thing can so , let the creativity flows . The ideas have no limits they can either be about topics of the posts , new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ideas are especially more important when the blog is attracting good readership so , people want to read something which they could not find anywhere else but at your blog . <h> Wrap Up <p> It is always easy to dream about easy money , however ; there is no such thing as easy money . In order to run profitable , active and popular blog you need to work hard with patience and carefully devised strategy .

Her articles are more smart home-focused than TechCrunch and Gizmodo , but the site is also much smaller . She offers tips and suggestions about what devices are worth buying and she oftens ranks them from best to worst . <p> HomeAlarmReport offers product reviews of smart home devices including smart security systems , self-monitored security systems , security cameras , home automation devices , and internet security devices .

There are hundreds of tiny details you must get perfectly right to make a popular vid , and unless you are a fully-fledged videographer already , you probably should seek professional help with any moving pictures you want to make . <p> Because video production is n't something most people do every day , few know what to expect when they begin to collaborate on a video project . Unfortunately , that means many people make mistakes when choosing production companies to work with . Here are a few tips to help you have a positive and productive experience writing , recording , and reviewing your next professional video . <h> Do n't Expect the Demo Reel <p> Most production companies ' homepages boast a big central video full of dazzling clips of previous projects . This is their demo reel which you can find more examples of here and it is the company 's attempt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of clients . While you can use the demo reel to weed out companies that lack professionalism , you can not know what to expect of a production company based on its demo. 5902 @qwx625902 <h> Instead : Research Recent Projects <p> Demo reels contain clips of production companies ' works , but they do n't show you the whole picture . The best companies have a section on their website devoted to recent projects , so you can review their true quality and appropriateness to your needs . You should expect a completed project , not a flashy set of clips . <h> Do n't Expect Your First Find to Be the Best <p> It 's easy enough to find a production company in your area using a simple web search , but not every studio is equipped to serve every need . For example , you do n't want a wedding videographer filming your business commercial . What 's more , not every production company 's pricing model is the same , so you might end up paying way more for way less if you opt for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Quotes <p> By reviewing a handful of production companies , you will build better expectations of the proper price range and available features to create the video you want . Then , you can weigh these findings against your evaluation of project quality to find the studio with the best value , like this video production company in Orlando . <h> Do n't Expect to Get Amazing Results at Low Prices <p> You get what you pay for and in no industry is that more true than video production . You can set your budget at $10 and still be able to afford a video , but there is no guarantee that it is the video you expect . You will sacrifice any number of features for low prices , and you 'll probably walk away from the project feeling disappointed . <h> Instead : Know Your Needs <p> There is no shame in hiring an up-and-coming video producer with a slim portfolio for the sake of your budget , but you should recognize that less-experienced ( or otherwise cheap ) video production providers simply can not match the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If you have the resources , you should probably go with a bigger , better production company . <h> Do n't Expect Them to Know Your Style <p> Just like any good business , a video production company has its own style . Unfortunately , that style does n't necessarily align with yours . Worse still , you might be tempted to dump your video idea with the production company without fully explaining your expectations for the video 's style . The only result in this situation is a wasted budget and an unusable video . <h> Instead : Explain Your Brand in Detail <p> Your brand is unique and your business is unique , so you should n't expect your video production company to know everything about you from the get-go . You should have an extensive pre-production period in which you can provide information about your background and goals for the video . Then , you will be more likely to obtain a video with the right style . <h> Do n't Expect Help With Online Services <p> Video is never-endingly useful , which means your video could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . However , few video production companies offer more than a few cameras , lights , and editing services , and not all are willing to modify videos for use online . <h> Instead : Ask About Added Value <p> Online services are usually included in a section of features called added value , which usually contain a bevy of supplemental marketing efforts . At the very least , you must ascertain whether your video production company can produce internet-capable films , but if you are n't particularly social media " savvy , you might look expressly for a firm that has online video smarts. 5901 @qwx625901 5903 @qwx625903

This typically results in high bounce rates , whereas user-centric designs keep visitors on the site . <h> Tip #4 : Capture leads <p> Just like a B2C website , the primary goal of a B2B website should be to drive conversions .

And include them individually in each page . This can be done using include function of php . But remember , for using this function , all your files must be saved with an extension *. php not *. html . <h> Normal Resolution <p> A website should be having a resolution compatible with all the browsers . Normally websites are created at a 1280*768 resolution as it has now become a web standard now . But even after being created on this resolution , a website should be - checked in all other resolution for any kind of resolution errors or bugs . 5902 @qwx625902 <h> How to check your website quickly in - more than one resolution ? <p> You can simply take help from a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which help you in checking your website in more than one resolutions rapidly . However if you are working on an offline server while creating a website , then you have to do this work manually . <h> Explanatory Site Map <p> A site map is a very useful accessory of any website hosting . Any visitor can get a clear idea about what is contained in that particular website and a proper navigation is given to him/her about it . So , if you want to develop a high standard website , then there should be a site map in it . <h> How to make a good site map ? <p> The simplest way to create a site map is make a basic structure of it first. - The structure can further be employed to create simple one-level lists and also display the hierarchical structure of your web site by nesting lists if your site s more complex . <p> But it is just the basic structural layout , for more attractive design , you can simply add more power to your site map by using graphics in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some other tool etc . That completely depends on you . But the aim is to make a clear and explanatory site map . <h> More use of safe web colors <p> You must be going with the safe colors and fonts ( which can be viewed on any software and even with basic system ) so as to cater the needs of all kind of visitors . More you will use safe colors , better would be your site visits as now every one would be able to enjoy the color combinations and all the information provided on your website very clearly . This is why we do recommend to use these kind of colors and fonts . <h> How to know about safe colors ? <p> There are so many online web safe palettes which will let you know about all the safe colors you can use in your website . Use this one if you are not getting access to any other good one . And you will know , how with even basic colors , a website can be made so beautiful . <h> Centered- on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be clear to the visitor . You should take care about this that sometimes the theme and name of website are chosen opposite to that of the concept which misguides the visitor and this should not be done at any cost . Mostly if a commercial website related to any company is to be built , its focus is quite clear i.e. to explore the companys services in front of the people , but in case any blog is to be launched for the sake of income , then mostl <p> y people do the same mistake of having a non focused concept which completely- destroys- the visit count of that particular website or it never- built- up because of this . <h> Simple Layout <p> The layout of the website should be kept as simple as it could be . The complex layouts sometimes cause irritation to the visitor and it may happen that it would let him/her to never visit your site back even after your site is having useful content . And it is not necessary that only a complexed and highly detailed layout would make your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a simple layout too . A Layout as shown here in the image is one of the best layouts for creating commercial and mini websites . Or you can also follow your own creation . <h> How to think about a good layout ? <p> Naah ! Never think about it . Just go through the layouts of too much websites , pick some of your favorites , combine their qualities and make your own . Or simply take reference from this fabulous layout- referral . <h> Optimize loading time <p> One of the most important factor which lays much emphasis on the visit count of your website is its loading time . Not only much bandwidth would be wasted but also it would panic visitors much if your websites theme is too heavy to load . It happens mostly with those websites which has too much of images . Not only in their articles , but also in their designs . <h> How to optimize the loading time ? <p> There are certain kind of optimizations which you can do . <p> 1 . ) Optimize your theme : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theme . And remember , never use a complete image in the background . Rather than using a complete image , using repeated chunks is a better option . It is also important choose right vps hosting or windows webhosting . <p> 2 . ) Optimizing the images : You can simply use some online or offline tool so as to optimize your images . Follow our wonderful list of 27 stunning image optimization tools for web designers , choose your favorite one and go with it . You can also use some codecs which will make your images to be loaded in a blurring pattern which also helps in optimizing them . <h> What should not be done ? <h> No hit counters <p> I wonder why some website and blog owners put these counters in their websites and blogs ? I mean , your visitors are simply not interested in how many your website has been taken or how much visitors are online now ! This not only lay a bad emphasis on the websites standard but also sometimes degrades it quality . <h> What if I want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to use them , then do it . But only for yourself . Not for others . Use counters from some standard website like whos.amung.us which provides a complete stats of the website . Pick their gadget ( counter or somewhat else ) and Place it in some corner of your website like bottom right or bottom left . It should n't be a part of website , but just a tool used for analysis . <h> No flash texts <p> Some people think that using flashing texts would make their website much attractive . But it rather makes it dump and low standard . Using flash for making banners is not a good practice as far not necessarily needed . Moreover , it sometimes irritate visitors and they could redirect to somewhere else from your website which you never be wanting so . <h> How to use flash texts in website ? <p> If you still want to use flash texts in your website , then use them at the place of buttons . Some lite and good effect texts used on / or at the place of buttons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easy , you should be having a sound knowledge of embedding flash withing HTML ( with functionality ) to do so . Thus better is to avoid them . <h> No background sounds <p> Imagine you have opened a website and suddenly a sound structs your ears and all your work concentration gets destructed . Anyone will feel irritated in this kind of situation . Background music not only slows the speed of website loading but also irritate visitors . Thus it should n't be there . <h> Where I can use background music ? <p> You can make use of background music if you are having a music based website because it is obvious that if a person is going to open a music website then he/she is in mood of listening to the music . But remember , music embedded should be calm and relaxing , not of that rock type . <h> No- Unnecessary- Pop Ups <p> Unnecessary pop ups are not a source of fascinating your visitors , rather it irritates them a lot . Thus it is much better to avoid unnecessary pop ups as they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visitors . I would never like to visit any website for going whoms page , I have to pass through two or three pop ups first . Thus , pop ups should be avoided as far as possible . <h> Where should pop ups be placed ? <p> If pop ups are to be used in your website then use it in Login form , register form , or some introductory form such as where you do n't  like to create a whole page just for the sake of an isolated but introductory paragraph , then just add it inside a pop up and give an eye catching link of that on home page , etc . Where ever you use it , use it smartly . <h> No unnecessary ads <p> Although ads are the source of income for most of the website owners and especially for those who have launched websites just for the revenue purpose but more ads on a single page would weaken the idea of website and this way you would be having a great loss only in desire to earn a little more . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is upon you , ads are not a part of website design , and where to use it ca n't be suggested by a designer like me .

Is this a sales oriented brochure that will make its way into the hands of prospective customers/clients or will it be used in-house ? <p> Once you have clearly identified the ultimate purpose of the brochure you can begin thinking about how to take those photos . Your printer can also be an invaluable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as Print-Print.co.uk A4 Brochure Printing make it a priority to give you the tools you need to design the best brochure possible for your needs . 5902 @qwx625902 <h> Quality of Photographs <p> One of the most important factors to consider when taking photos for your brochure is the quality of the pictures . Are your brochures going to be used in-house only being distributed to staff or are they purposed for advertising/marketing ? Of course you do n't ever want poor quality photos , even if only staff will see them , but it is vitally important to use the highest quality possible for marketing purposes . Nothing smacks of being less-than-professional as much as a blurry , poor quality photo . <p> Here is where you need to decide whether or not to use the services of a professional photographer . Are you going to have pictures of some of your hot ' items for sale ? Will you be using photographs of key staff members , board members or past clients ? If you answered yes to any of those questions , then it might be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shots for you . For the small extra cost the rewards could be huge . <h> The Cost Factor <p> Then there is the cost factor . Does your printer charge more for multi-colour brochures than for those with only two or three colours ? If cost is an issue , then the style of photography will be affected as well . There was a time when full-colour brochures were so much more expensive than black and white but with advances in technology , the cost has evened out quite a bit . <p> Bear in mind that photos meant to sell are taken under specialised lighting techniques and quite often with particular angles to capture the best qualities " or skew them if desired . If you intend to take your own photos for your brochure , make sure to use a professional quality camera and take enough pictures so that you can select the best of the lot . Your printer can often help you choose which will work the best , but if quality is lacking , there might be no way to use them effectively . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's best to hire a pro . 5901 @qwx625901 5903 @qwx625903

@@73220459 @1920459/ <h> 6 Questions to ask when creating forms for your website <p> A website is essentially a medium for communication between a brand and the online community . Forms make this communication complete by giving the audience a voice and the opportunity to be more than just visitors . If you use them right , forms immediately improve user experience and increase the value of your web content . But if not , then you 've only wasted a lot of time and effort . Poorly-made forms are also frustrating for your audience and will discourage them visiting again . <p> To build awesomeforms for your website , here are six questions you need to answer first : <h> 1 . What Are They For ? <p> There are different kinds of forms built for very specific purposes . Granted , making a good looking form and plugging it into a web page is easy . But first , you must answer the question : why do you need this particular form ? 5902 @qwx625902 <p> Do you need a form to incorporate interactivity with your site ? Remember @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to gather feedback from your audience . These forms make the audience feel more engaged and foster customer loyalty if you pay attention to their feedback . A form may also be used for transactional purposes . For instance , you can use a well-detailed form to help your audience to get quotes for your services . <h> 2 . What Information Do You Need to Know ? <p> Once you identify the purpose of a form , it should be possible for you to determine the information you need from your audience . However , this process is a lot more complicated than you think . Remember that you need just enough information to give your audience the appropriate response without being invasive at the same time . Some of the information you may need include an email address , a physical address , their website 's URL , and a first name . <p> With the right amount of information , you should be able to place the audience in the right segmentation , which will help you offer them more relevant content in the future . Asking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the audience and may discourage them from proceeding . <h> 3 . How Will You Develop the Form ? <p> If you 're using a Content Management System ( CMS ) , then it should be easy to find tools or plugins you need to get the job done . For example , a quick Google search will help you find tools for creating a WordPress contact form , opt-in form , event registration form , or survey form . Blogging platforms as well may contain built-in features for building various types of forms . <p> Next , pay attention to your form copy and make sure everything is optimized for your target audience . Use the appropriate language level and make the design responsive to cater to your mobile audience . Also give clear instructions to guide your audience throughout the form 's completion . Make sure to use only the necessary fields and prefill certain information if necessary . What 's important is that the audience wo n't feel bored when filling up your form . <h> 4 . Does The Form Work ? <p> Naturally , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they deliver the experience intended to users . Apart from making sure that the form displays and functions properly , you should also check whether it works in accomplishing the original purpose of getting the information you need . <p> When it comes to the testing process , try to get some of your customers involved in a private testing session . Of course , your development team should also be hard at work early on . Remember that you need to detect any issue and fix them as early as possible to avoid losing potential customers . <h> 5 . Is It Visible ? <p> Aside from functionality and appearance , the visibility of your form is also extremely important . For this step , you need to look at your site 's overall layout and theme . For example , does your design have plenty of clutter ? Or are there certain elements that grab the attention of your users away from your newly-made form ? <p> Cleaning up your site 's design is a great way to boost the visibility of forms . Alternatively , you may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bring your audience to the form . <h> 6 . How Will You Improve It ? <p> In web design , constant monitoring and optimization will help you achieve the very best version of your site . The same principle applies for individual site elements such as ads and forms . For this task , you can take advantage of the built-in analytics tools in form builders or rely on third-party software such as heatmap tools . <p> You should also learn to split test your forms to speed up the optimization process . Focus on editing the ad text , instructions , hints , and error messages to ensure the best possible experience to your audience . To make sure you do n't overlook any key element that affects the performance of your form , see to it that you generate daily , weekly , or monthly reports and notice patterns . Finally , do n't forget to review the performance of the entire site as it directly affects the conversion rate you get for your form . 5901 @qwx625901 5903 @qwx625903

He will not wait for anymore than 3-4 seconds and will move to another website . Also , the website loading time plays a major role in improving any website 's ranking for a search engine . It has also been learnt through a survey that 75% people agreed with the fact that they will not like to revisit any website that takes time to load and for them , 3-4 seconds is too late . If you are a website owner , you must understand that having a fast website is very important for you otherwise your competitors will leave you in the dumps .

If your website contains unusually large images , obviously your website will take a lot of time to load . 5902 @qwx625902 <p> If you want to make your website a fast one , you need to make sure that your website is efficient . Improving the website load time can be done by making a few minor changes in website 's coding , image resolution and of course the layout of the website . <h> Keep a track of your Page Speed <p> Keeping a track of your page speed is not at all difficult .

It is very important for you to compress images according to web-based quality . Compressing images is not at all difficult as you can simply do it by Google 's page speed plugin . Once the image has been compressed , reload the image . <h> Step 2 : Scaling Images <p> After the compression of images , scaling images is very important so that the fit into website properly . This is very important because it omits the server 's need of resizing the images during website 's loading . Scale images by using Photoshop and adjust the pixel size according to the HTML code . <h> Step 3 : Make use of browser caching <p> This is a great way to reduce the server lag so utilize the browser @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . htaccess file for reduce server log time . <h> Step 4 : CSS Sprites <p> CSS Sprites is indeed a great way to reduce the number of images added on a single page . It is basically like a collage i.e. , one large image containing a lot of small images . You can combine a few images and make them one by using CSS Sprites . This way , website will load one image and five will be displayed . <h> Step 5 : Deferring the JavaScript 's parsing <p> At times , JavaScript blocks page rendering due to which the loading of the website gets slow . In order to avoid this thing , you should avoid calling these scripts in the beginning and should prefer calling them at the end of an HTML . <h> Step 6 : Compressing HTML , JavaScript and CSS <p> You can compress HTML , JavaScript and CSS in order to speed up the loading procedure . You can find various resources on the web for this procedure and t will help you a lot . <h> Step 7 : Content @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ server 's lag . A lot of websites user CDN among which the well known are NBA.com and ESPN.com and I must say that these websites are not at all slow when it comes to loading . <h> Step 8 : Combination of JavaScript and CSS <p> If you will load various JavaScript and CSS files , you will make your website extremely slow . Try to combine JavaScript and CSS within one large file . By doing this you will be speeding up your website like anything . <h> Step 9 : Website for mobiles <p> While you are developing a website or an app for mobile , I would strongly recommend you to go through Google 's webmaster guidelines for smartphone applications . Although , the guidelines are constantly changing however , you should be aware of the basic requirements for creating a website or an app for mobiles . I am sure in the coming years , a website 's speed will be among the most important things to consider while developing a website . <p> Conclusion <p> The above mentioned things might be a few but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any website . If you have a website that loads quickly , you will surely see a drastic change in your website 's traffic and also your website 's ranking will improve greatly .
