@@59668021 @8668021/ <h> QUESTION 1 - TRANSPORTATION EQUITY <p> Biking and walking not only improves public health , but it is a prevalent form of transportation for people who ca n't afford a car and/or gas , are too young to drive , or are not mentally or physically able to drive . According to Census data , nearly 22 percent of Richmond households do not own or otherwise have access to a car . The challenge for Richmond is to increase access to safe biking and walking for opportunities for all citizens . <p> What measures can we expect your administration to take to expand access to safe walking and biking infrastructure for all Richmond residents ? <p> LEVAR STONEY : The city has done a great job of going after " low hanging fruit . " We need to stop thinking in terms of " the show " and start thinking in terms of the user . In my administration I will work with organizations like Sports Backers , along with neighborhood and civic associations and City Council , to think about where we are putting lanes and work to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , now its time for City Hall to get to work . I will find the political will necessary to fully implement the Bicycle Master Plan by actively engaging the community and having a working relationship with City Council . I have experience building coalitions to implement real change - as Mayor , I will use that experience to harness the citys momentum and put us on par with other cities who are becoming more pedestrian friendly . <h> QUESTION 2 - COMPLETE STREETS <p> In October of 2014 , Richmond City Council passed a Complete Streets Resolution ( No. 2014-R172-170 ) that states the City will within one year modify street design and construction manuals , codes , ordinances , and standards to reflect that " all transportation improvement projects in the city be planned for , designed , and constructed to provide appropriate accommodation for persons of all ages and abilities , including pedestrians , bicyclists , transit passengers , and motorists , while promoting safe operations for all users . " Nearly two years later , these changes have not been adopted . <p> If elected Mayor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Streets Policy ? <p> STONEY : Richmond has developed a reputation for debating , planning , and then not implementing . This is about transforming City Hall . On my first day of this campaign I called for a complete performance review and audit of every city department - I want to know who the top performers are and who the under performers are . As Mayor , I 'm going to lead from the top down and transform the way the city operates . People pay a premium to live in Richmond , but we are not getting premium services . As Executive Director of the Democratic Party of Virginia and as Secretary of the Commonwealth , I ensured efficiency and accountability . As Mayor , I will do the same . It is unacceptable that some of our residents are unable to experience all our city has to offer because of the design and construction of some of our streets . As we become a more pedestrian-friendly city , we must continue to improve infrastructure and create safe , accessible , and user-friendly options for all of our residents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a strategy to eliminate all traffic fatalities and severe injuries , while increasing safe , healthy , equitable mobility for all . On March 7 , 2016 , Richmond City Council passed a Vision Zero Resolution ( No. 2016-R011 ) that " supports the development of a Vision Zero program for the City of Richmond with the goal of reducing traffic fatalities and serious injuries in road traffic to zero by the year 2030 . " <p> As Mayor , what policy steps would you take to improve education , engineering , enforcement , and emergency response with the purpose of achieving zero traffic-related deaths and serious injuries by 2030 ? <p> STONEY : I would look for innovative solutions like the ones currently being used in Portland where they have mapped-out traffic safety hot spots and use the data to make informed decisions about infrastructure improvements and safety information . Using data-driven governance to ensure safety is working in cities across America , and it can work here too . We are living in an Xbox era , but there are people in government still using Ataris . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has invested in other safety measures and now its time to make bike safety a priority as well . This is also an education issue - we need to make sure our children understand the importance of road safety from a young age , whether as a pedestrian , a cyclist , or a driver . <h> QUESTION 4 - INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS <p> In May of 2015 , the City of Richmond finished work on the citys first Bicycle Master Plan , which calls for implementation of 135 miles of new bikeways by 2025 . By the end of 2016 , the city will have 25 miles of bikeways on the ground , all of which have been " low hanging fruit " . However , few if any of our new bikeways connect to each other or major destinations . <p> As Mayor , how would you grow the mileage of bikeways in Richmond to fill in the gaps and form a connected network ? <p> STONEY : The top priority in terms of walking , biking , and infrastructure needs to be building out a comprehensive , thoughtful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of phase one and connect the segments - and with them - connect more cyclists to our communities . We also need to think about diversity of the user and keep safety requirements in mind . This is a priority in terms of continuing to attract tourism and adapting to the more pedestrian-heavy city Richmond has become . I have already committed to doing quarterly office hours in all nine districts and to attending City Council meetings . I will engage the community and build the political relationships necessary to actually get things done . As Mayor , I will grow mileage by finding the political will to proceed with the implementation of the plan . The blueprint is complete , what 's needed now is collaboration and leadership to actually add the miles and finish what we have started . <h> QUESTION 5 - FUNDING <p> Establishing safe and accessible places for people to bike and walk for transportation will require additional funding for capital projects , either in the form of Federal grants , State revenue-sharing , or the Citys Capital Improvement Program ( CIP ) . In May @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CIP budget for bicycle infrastructure more than any previous fiscal year in addition to funding for sidewalks , crosswalks , and traffic calming . Furthermore , City Council added $300,000 to fully fund the T. Tyler Potterfield Memorial Bridge , a walking and biking bridge from Browns Island to Manchester . <p> Do you support pursuing additional funding ( in the CIP or other sources ) for biking and walking infrastructure ? If yes , how much ? <p> STONEY : Cities of similar sizes are making this investment and Richmond should be too . With the right leadership and vision , outside dollars will be more than happy to invest in projects like these . I have already said that I will be creative and think outside the box in terms of finding additional dollars for the city - working to find corporate partners , philanthropic dollars , and bringing the nonprofit , private , and government sectors together to achieve common goals . Right now , City Hall is lacking a leader who is championing all that makes Richmond great . Were a top destination for outdoor recreation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about it - attracting investment and tourism along the way . <h> QUESTION 1 - INTER-GOVERNMENT REFORMS/INTENTIONALITY <p> Richmonders are long tired of stories of inter-government dysfunction and miscommunication between the Mayor , City Council , and School Board when it comes to education . Prime examples include the annual contentious budget season and the discoordination in school construction and operation that led to the failed opportunity with a new MLK Middle School . <p> What will you do to ensure that your office bolsters inter-governmental efforts to support a world-class education system ? <p> STONEY : For me , this is about transforming City Hall and the way things are done . That 's how I have approached all of the positions I have held . In working as Executive Director of the Virginia Democratic Party and Secretary of the Commonwealth , I was n't just pushing paper . I was managing multimillion dollar budgets and recruiting , inspiring , and motivating diverse staffs who were effectively creating change . As Mayor , I 'll do the same . I will be a hands-on , visible , transparent leader . When the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on doors . I will be collaborator-in-chief , the chief accountability officer , and the buck will always stop with me . I plan on surrounding myself with the best talent and leading from the top down . If individuals are not interested in improving the overall quality of life for Richmonds citizens , they will not have a place in my administration . <p> As the first in my family to graduate high school or attend college , I am the education candidate and will be the education Mayor . The Superintendent and the Mayor should be partners working together to achieve goals . Right now , there is nothing formally requiring the Mayor to have a relationship with the Superintendent . I believe that needs to change and I hope the Superintendent will accept my invitation to attend all of my cabinet meetings as a key stakeholder in improving the lives of Richmonds children . I look forward to being a partner with not only the Superintendent , but the School Board , CIty Council , state government , and federal government as well . The Mayor should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get things done and actually improve education . Its time to break down the silos , define responsibilities , stop fighting , and start working together . <h> QUESTION 2 - SUSTAINABLE FUNDING <p> An increased and sustainable stream of education funding will be needed overcome the backlog of facilities needs caused by systemic disinvestment , and to meet the needs of educating students from highly-concentrated poverty . With Richmonds limited bond capacity , revenue streams , and disadvantage from state funding policies , this will not be an effort that Richmonds residents can bear alone . <p> What is your plan to identify the necessary combination of state , private , and local revenues to provide sustainable funding for an education overhaul ? <p> STONEY : Providing sustainable funding is an important responsibility the Mayor shares with the School Board , City Council , state and federal government . As a nation , were not investing enough in public education . If we truly believe , as I do , that the path out of poverty is education then we can never be investing too much . As the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ college , I am proof positive that kids can prove the statistics wrong if they 're given an opportunity to succeed . Being a strong Mayor is about more than just writing a check to RPS and cleaning your hands it is about collaboration . As Mayor , I intend to team up with the Superintendent and the School Board to actually set and then achieve our goals , whether it is improving attendance , graduation , or teacher retention rates . <p> As Mayor , I will also ensure we receive more than our fair share from the state and federal government . We suffer from the poorly structured Local Composite Index funding formula , which rewards localities with significant enrollment growth and fails to factor in the poverty of the students . This means that counties like Henrico and Chesterfield are receiving more money from the state than Richmond , which has substantially more poor students and a far greater need for state funding . <p> You 're going to see me tirelessly beating down the doors of our state and federal officials many of whom I have a great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ education , and a tireless advocate for Richmond students , who is going to fight for what we deserve . We need to be expanding resources strategically and focusing our efforts on providing students with the best 21st century education possible . <h> QUESTION 3 - TRANSFORMATIVE COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT <p> Recent events have shown the immense goodwill of our community for city schools : citizens came out in droves to support funding for Richmond Public Schools . Likewise , Richmond 's business community contributes amply to education initiatives every year . With all this good intention , we still lack transformational partnerships between the schools and business , neighborhood , or philanthropic service providers . <p> What will you do to maximize community support for public education by establishing transformative partnerships which empower individuals towards sustainable change ? <p> STONEY : This is exactly how we should be asking this question . As I have stated , I believe we need to transform the way we approach these issues as I have done in the past . This is about more than qualifications , its about who has vision and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need to bring the private sector , nonprofit , government , and communities together to achieve our goals . Programs like the Richmond Teacher Residency Program at VCU are a great example of work that 's already being done on this front . Its time for City Hall to start celebrating and expanding programs like this and stop thinking in compartmentalized ways when approach the economic development , community enhancements , and education . Its also time for government to recognize it often uses its own language , and we need to break down the barriers that make it hard for communities to collaborate starting with communication and engagement . <h> QUESTION 4 - STRATEGIC ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT <p> A combination of tax abatements and incentives used to attract businesses , develop historic properties , and boost tourism have nonetheless diminished the taxable property base in Richmond . Private market trends have shifted considerably in recent years , but our tax policies and economic understanding continue to leave Richmond Public Schools funding which many voters claim is a top investment priority short . <p> What is your economic development strategy to provide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ priority ? <p> STONEY : We need to make the business community want to invest in RPS . Our City has a public relations problem we need someone inside of City Hall championing all of the good work we do and encouraging more of it . For example , I met a group of graduating students who were residents of public housing and had all been accepted to college . There are many examples of achievements at RPS , like the work happening in Franklin Military Academy , which has a tremendous robotics program . They should be amplified and celebrated . As Mayor , you 'll see me celebrating the great work teachers and students at RPS are already doing and making sure residents know about it . <p> We need to maintain focus on the challenges in our school district , but its time we start celebrating and promoting achievements as well in order to attract investment . There are already great partnerships with corporations like Altria and Dominion . There are also great partnerships currently in place between local schools and small businesses as well , like the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In recruiting business to come to Richmond , we need to be making their contributions to RPS a priority . We can be doing a better job of reaching-out to the private sector to help us achieve our goals . I will be a leader who brings the private and nonprofit sectors to work together with government and invest in education . <h> QUESTION 1 <p> The City of Richmond has undertaken some successful planning processes in the past decade like the Downtown Master Plan and the Richmond Riverfront Plan . Each of these processes valued civic engagement and put forth results that have been embraced by the public . <p> As the Citys Master Plan is updated in the coming years , how will you as Mayor ensure that the city has a robust and inclusive civic engagement process ? <p> STONEY : As Mayor , I 'm going to be hands-on , visible , and transparent . I 'm not going to stop knocking on doors once the campaign is over - people are going to see me . We need to completely rethink how City Hall engages with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ communication . Often , programs come out of City Hall with an already fixed solution in mind . We need to be working with our community partners on the development and implementation of the programs , which will also increase engagement . As an example , the Richmond Transit Network Plan has set a gold standard for how we should involve residents in decisions that will impact their day to day lives through their regular public meetings and easy-to-navigate online surveys.We cant expect that people will come to us first , we need to be engaging citizens on every level . I will lead from the top down and set a standard within my administration that encourages active community and civic engagement . <h> QUESTION 2 <p> As the population continues to increase in the City of Richmond , conversations about displacement , housing affordability , and neighborhood change are top of mind for Richmonders . One effort to tackle these challenges was seen through the establishment of the first Office of Community Wealth Building in the nation . <p> Building on this framework , what tools do you think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> STONEY : I applaud the vision behind the Office of Community Wealth Building , and as Mayor I will enhance and expand it . I was knocking on doors in Laburnum Park recently and met an elderly woman whose home had been in the family for generations . She worries every day that she will be pushed out of her neighborhood , since her fixed income can not keep up with the rising cost of living . There is a great City program that offers tax breaks to seniors on a fixed income , and we need to work with community partners to encourage our seniors to enroll . In my administration , we will aggressively seek support from grants like Choice Neighborhoods and work with groups like the Maggie Walker Community Land Trust so that as Richmond grows , everyone can benefit . <h> QUESTION 3 <p> The great neighborhoods that make up the City of Richmond each have different stories , legacies , histories , and tomorrows . People , your constituents , continue to work for a better quality of life for themselves , their families @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Richmond neighborhoods to keep your finger on the pulse of our city ? What will you ask of the community to help you with your job ? <p> STONEY : I am committing to having quarterly office hours in every district . I am also committing to being a champion for the city . I have said from day one that I will be a hands-on , visible , transparent leader . I want to engage people one-on-one , whether its knocking doors , supporting local business , or visiting schools . People are going to see me out walking the streets of our city , whether it be enjoying one of the many events RVA has to offer , or going door to door with Chief Durham after a neighborhood tragedy . In return , I challenge the people of Richmond to play their part too , engaging with their community and working to become to clean , safe city that I know we can be . <h> QUESTION 4 <p> Youve read the many superlatives given to Richmond over the past few years , for our great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ river , and our entrepreneurial culture just to name a few . These come from specific neighborhoods and cover the community at large . <p> What superlative would you like to see for our as a headline ? What role did the community play in its own transformation ? <p> STONEY : I would like to see the superlative " Richmond on the Rise " - because I know it truly is . Despite being on the rise though , we find ourselves at a crossroads . That 's where the community comes in . We can either accept more of the same or look for a fresh , new , dynamic leader that will harness our momentum and get us to the next level . The community has already stepped up in places where government has lagged behind . I plan on being a leader who will match the communitys efforts and then challenge us to achieve even more . Together , we can tackle the issues we face and grow to be mentioned in the same breath as cities like Atlanta , Nashville , and Charlotte . <h> QUESTION @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1.3 million visitors in 2015 , making it the most-visited attraction in the region . Many believe the park system is underfunded and understaffed . <p> What is your plan for supporting the James River Park System ? <p> STONEY : I believe the James River is a jewel - " Richmonds Wet Central Park . " As Mayor , I will make sure more people and communities will have access to it . Working to fund priorities , find corporate and nonprofit sponsorships for programs , and connecting students to the James River will all be part of my focus in supporting the James River Park System . I will be a champion in City Hall for things like the JRPS . Its time to start celebrating what makes Richmond great - and the JRPS is a key part of what makes us an attractive place to live , work , and visit . I will be advocate for connecting the JRPS to all kids in the city . Richmond is a destination for outdoor recreation , but we need to ensure that all of our residents can take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ riverfront is experiencing a transformation catalyzed by public and private investment . The City 's ability to fund capital projects may be limited in the coming years . <p> How will you continue implementation the Richmond Riverfront Plan ? Which projects are priorities ? <p> STONEY : I see the role of Mayor as the " Grand Convener " of the public , private , academic , and nonprofit sectors . I will work with the James River Association on assessing the priorities and setting and achieving ambitious goals . There has already been a lot of work done - but we still have work to do . The City 's Downtown Plan , in particular , set forth terrific goals for the Riverfront but most have not yet been achieved . People in Richmond are tired of seeing City Government make plans , debate , and then never implement what it has set out to do . In my administration , City Hall will be acting - not debating - and working to expedite progress on the Richmond Riverfront Plan . <h> QUESTION 3 <p> Water quality in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Term Control Plan and the Stormwater Utility . <p> How will you address the City 's Combined Sewer Overflow ( CSO ) system and ensure water quality improvement continues ? <p> STONEY : It is 2016 , not 1816 - we should not be worried about clean water for our citizens . This needs to be a public health and an environmental priority . This will require collaboration with the state government and innovative thinking . Something I bring to the table is great working relationships with the General Assembly on both sides of the aisle . Beyond that , we need to educate the public about the river without causing panic . It will be a priority of my administration to partner with groups like the James River Association , collaborate with the state government , and implement innovative and creative approaches to solving our problems . <h> QUESTION 4 <p> Tributaries of the James River ( Reedy Creek , Upham Brook , Gillies Creek ) are experiencing water quality improvement thanks to the efforts of City staff in recent years , but these projects do not come without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ improvements continue and address community concerns ? <p> STONEY : I absolutely think that the community needs to be included in process - making it transparent and accountable . I have already committed in this campaign to doing quarterly office hours in all nine districts as an example of the community engagement I will promote . <h> QUESTION 5 <p> The James River Association is a part of the No Child Left Inside Coalition , working to increase every child 's access to environmental education and meaningful outdoor experiences . <p> What is the Mayor 's role in ensuring every child has access to outdoor education experiences ? <p> STONEY : We need to be connecting more people - especially children - to our resources . I plan on working with City Council , the School Board , and the Superintendent to give kids access to the types of resources we have here in Richmond that kids in other cities can only dream of . I view Parks and Recreation as a wraparound service and as Mayor , I will be making sure were opening the doors of City Hall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ services . I have committed to expanding afterschool and summer programs to more of our children so that every child has access to an outdoor education experience . We must be doing all that we can to improve the overall quality of life of our children . Outdoor education is a key part of that . <h> QUESTION 1 <p> State and federal plans are in the works to make Richmond a stop on a proposed higher speed rail route along the eastern seaboard . <p> Do you support a higher speed rail connection between Richmond and the Northeast Corridor ? <p> STONEY : Absolutely ! Richmond is at a crossroads - literally . We are the gateway to the " New South . " We can either move forward and become competitive , or , we can fall further behind . High speed rail is a game changing dynamic . If were going to be competitive with other cities we need to embrace connectivity to other regions of the east coast . <h> QUESTION 2 <p> The station options being proposed for a higher speed rail connection in Richmond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a Boulevard Station . <p> Which Richmond station option do you think offers the greatest opportunity for economic development and connectivity ? <p> STONEY : There are pros and cons to all options and everything needs to be on the table . I will say that having a " downtown to downtown " connection would be an ideal scenario . Furthermore , we have already made investments to improving the Main Street Station , which will be directly connected to the BRT . Advantages to a Boulevard Station would be a brand new , completely functional and modern complex in a burgeoning neighborhood . When it comes to these decisions , we must look for the most practical and cost effective solution . As Mayor , I will work with outside partners and the state and federal government to achieve the best deal for the city . I also believe we ca n't be thinking in the context of having just one station with access to higher speed rail . Other cities on the line have two stations servicing them - that should be an option for our region as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vision Plan will be complete in the fall of 2016 . This project , which is being undertaken by the Virginia Department of Rail and Public Transportation in partnership with the jurisdictions of Metro Richmond , will offer the layout of a regional public transit network , but one premised on regional cooperation . <p> What are the barriers to regional cooperation from your perspective , and how do you intend to foster more collaboration in order to bring this much-needed plan to fruition ? <p> STONEY : As Mayor , I plan on being collaborator in chief with our friends in the surrounding counties . I have established relationships - and the leadership and vision necessary - to get everyone around the table . If we want to grow our economy and take our region to the next level , we need to work together to create a comprehensive and competitive transportation network that will allow all of us to grow and win . With clear direction , a fresh approach , and commitment to collaboration , I will tackle any barriers standing in the way of regional cooperation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Broad Street BRT route will be a first of its kind in our region . <p> What do you think is the next key corridor to focus on expanding our BRT system ? Why ? <p> STONEY : Whatever your opinion about Bus Rapid Transit - I personally supported it - it is critical that we acknowledge that BRT is the beginning of a wider , regional transit network in Central Virginia . The Broad Street line is a good start and provides transportation from east to west , but I would want to explore a North/South corridor next - perhaps along Jefferson Davis Highway and Chamberlayne Ave . This is about economics : transportation connects people to jobs , and additional routes will improve the quality of life for all Richmonders . <h> QUESTION 5 <p> The most successful transit networks in the country have a dedicated revenue stream , and our lack of dedicated funding for public transportation has been cited as the number one challenge to providing transit for the region . <p> Do you support a dedicated source of funding for transit ? If so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , why not ? <p> STONEY : We need to be doing a better job of beating down the door of state and federal government officials , this is a shared responsibility and I vow to be a champion for transportation funding . I will use my relationships on both levels and build new coalitions to find the funds necessary to make transportation a priority . A transformative , 21st century transportation plan not only puts Richmond on the map , it improves the quality of life of those living here . The resource are there - and as Mayor - I will show leadership in tirelessly advocating for them . <h> QUESTION 6 <p> The Richmond Transit Network Plan ( RTNP ) , which will be complete in January 2017 and is being undertaken by the City in consultation with Jarrett Walker + Associates , is an incredibly unique opportunity to enhance the bus lines for which the City pays , particularly in coordination with the BRT . <p> How will you personally play a role in the creation and implementation of this plan , regardless of the outcome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ RTNP for their efforts to intimately involve members of the community in the design process for the new transit network , whether through regular community meetings in all corners of the city , or through the easy-to-navigate web surveys . As a candidate , I encourage all residents to engage with the RTNP planning process now - that way , people are informed when Jarrett Walker + Associates present their three options to City Council in 2017 . As Mayor , I will be hands-on in these discussions , so that when Council make their choice , I can head back out into the community and involve residents in the development and implementation process , too . RTNP are setting a gold standard for how we should engage Richmonders in decisions that impact their day to day lives .

' and I said , I 've always wanted to go to horticulture school . ' " <p> It was an ironic shift , considering his rejection of Cornell years earlier . " My parents got to say , We told you to do that years ago . ' " <p> Still , Robinson bucked tradition . He looked only briefly at bigger , well-known programs at Clemson , Cornell and Penn State . At the time , those schools were heavily focused on research related to the floriculture industry " mass-produced annuals and perennial flowers ruled the day . <p> " It was n't what I wanted to do , " Robinson says . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So I ended up going to this little tiny school in western North Carolina . " <p> The two-year certificate program through a state community college was part of an initiative to diversify North Carolina 's agriculture industry , long dominated by cash crops such as tobacco and cotton . <p> It was in this program that Robinson learned to roll up his sleeves , get his hands dirty and sweat . " I was lucky I fell into that program , " he says , crediting hands-on instructors . " The only thing we did n't do was mow grass and rake leaves . " <p> It all seemed very practical , except to his father-in-law , who asked the obvious : " One , you 're going to back to school and my daughter is supporting you ? And two , you 're going to a place in Clyde , N.C. , as opposed to Clemson ? What are you thinking ? " <p> The answer may not have satisfied his father-in-law , but it made perfect sense to Robinson . <p> " It seemed like it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I did n't have any strategy at all . I was n't ever looking to be or assuming that I would have any affluence at all . I just loved doing it . It really was about the passion . Horticulturists are down on the ground with the dirt . I just wanted to grow things " I wanted to make gardens . " <p> Detour to New York <p> The day when he would get his chance to " make gardens " remained a long way off . First , he 'd have yet another pivotal encounter with Japanese culture " and an almost Daoistic stroke of bad luck that turned out to be good luck . <p> Upon finishing his horticulture program , Robinson and his wife turned their eyes back toward western New York , where his parents still lived and were experiencing health issues . He quickly found a job as head gardener at the George Eastman House in Rochester , which was about to undergo renovation inside and out . He interviewed with the foundation director , was offered the job and headed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he returned to Rochester , he discovered that the foundation director had been fired and his job had been eliminated . <p> " So I was kind of going g-o-o-o-o-d " I think it was October , it was already snowing . Where are you going to find a job in horticulture ? " <p> Both he and JoRoyce instead landed jobs in retail . <p> " I was selling discount shoes , " at department store Sibley , Lindsay and Curr Co. , he says , now chuckling at the significant setback . " JoRoyce worked at McCurdy 's . She worked in linens . That sustained us . " <p> One day , the couple read about a traveling exhibition of dolls coming to Rochester 's famous Strong National Museum of Play . The exhibition , titled " Blue-eyed Dolls , " featured American dolls that had been brought by missionaries to Japan in the decades before World War II . <p> " When the war broke out , it was culturally unacceptable for the little girls to play with these dolls anymore , and they were supposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> But love is love , and many little girls had rescued their dolls , hiding them away for decades . <p> As the exhibition arrived in Rochester , a reception was planned that included many of the women whose dolls were part of the exhibition , and a news article about the event included a plea for anyone in town who spoke Japanese to come help translate . <p> " And there 's this shoe salesman from Sibley 's , " he says , recalling showing up with a Japanese dictionary in hand . <p> " Suddenly there 's this little lady " her name was Mildred Finebloom " she comes running across the room dragging this little Japanese woman in a kimono yelling , Tell them this ! Tell them this ! ' " <p> It was a fortunate meeting . <p> " Mildred became like an adopted mother to us , " says Robinson , who served as Finebloom 's personal translator for the next week and then as her personal gardener after that . Of his career in shoe sales , Robinson says , " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> She did n't waste hers . A formidable woman in Rochester society , she pulled strings and helped land Robinson an interview at the Rochester Institute of Technology . <p> The job , redeveloping a 1,500-acre campus , was daunting and included everything from maintaining athletic fields to cut flowers for the president 's office . <p> His time in the job also was brief . <p> " At some point , my wife wanted to come back to the South . She hated the New York winters , and , honestly , she was desperate to get out of there , " says Robinson , who engaged a headhunter . He soon got a call from a place near Charlottesville called Kluge . Robinson had never heard of Kluge , and the job title sounded a lot like he 'd be a servant on a private estate : " Live over the garage and pick up the dog poop and bring in firewood , that sort of thing . " <p> He declined three times before finally agreeing to come for an interview at the somewhat desperate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he became very familiar with the name Kluge . John W. Kluge , a media mogul who died in 2010 , was once the richest man in America . His wife , Patricia ( whom he divorced in 1990 ) , was a famous socialite . <p> " The reason they wanted me was I had that breadth of experience , everything from the turf maintenance to the private conservatory and greenhouses . I had done that , " Robinson says . " I had a staff of 20 . " <p> He did not live over a garage . <p> For him and JoRoyce , it was a job that was both in the middle of everything and completely isolating . <p> " Talk about another world you 'd never experienced before , " he says . " If Japan was another world , living in the 1980s among the rich and famous was another world . <p> " It was a very hard job , " he says . " We were all on call 24 hours a day . But it was an extraordinary experience , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surreal . In between raising a family " son Alec had been born in Rochester and son Ian was born in Charlottesville " he was helping the Kluges make a name for their estate . <p> Every week was something new that elevated his role from gardener to something else . " The empress of Iran came after the Shah had been murdered , " he recalls . " She was there for the weekend , and we planted a tree in honor of the Shah , and she was there for the ceremony . And I handed her a shovel . This was the sort of context of what life was like there . " <p> Course Correction <p> And again , life needed to change . Robinson worked nearly four years with the Kluges before taking a position as executive director of the American Horticultural Society in Alexandria . <p> The Horticultural Society job lured him with the promise of opportunity to build another garden from scratch . " We had 27 acres right on the Potomac River , a beautiful piece of property but undeveloped , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fundraising was , you know , very challenging ... and so we never quite got around to doing that part of the project . " <p> He settled into a job that essentially transformed him into a publisher of the society 's national magazine . Then he heard about the Lewis Ginter job . " My name showed up apparently on a few lists , and I got a call one day asking if I 'd be interested in coming down and interviewing for the job , " he says . Despite the relative low profile of the new position , Robinson was at once excited by the prospect . <p> " We came here thinking we 'd be here three years , too , and find something else , " says Robinson , sitting back and glancing out the window of his office overlooking the Bloemendaal House garden with its English-style walk lined with tiny shrubs leading to a whitewashed gazebo . " This garden was the only completed garden we had . Where the gazebo is , is where the garden ended . " <p> Making the Valley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 80 acres , was owned by tobacco and real estate magnate Col. Lewis Ginter and later was home to his niece , philanthropist Grace Arents , whose dream it was to see Bloemendaal " Dutch for " valley of flowers " " turned into a park in tribute to her uncle . <p> She left the property to the city in 1926 when she died , and her dream remained unrealized for nearly 60 years . <p> In 1984 , Lewis Ginter Botanical Garden at last became a reality , largely with the financial momentum of one man , Lawrence Lewis , an heir to the fortune of Florida railroad tycoon Henry Flagler . Lewis , a philanthropist but also a very driven man , had been the force behind the development of St. Augustine , Fla. , and of Flagler College there . By the 1980s , he 'd been talked into putting some of his unrelenting energy into charitable deeds in his hometown of Richmond . <p> Though a board governed the garden , Robinson says it was quite clear who was in charge when he arrived . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he recalls . " He was here every day " and he did not understand gardens or the creations of gardens and what it takes . So we had to be on our toes . " <p> Used to brick-and-mortar projects , Lewis had little patience for seasons and saplings . <p> " He wanted to know why it was taking so long ! Why it was n't done ! When are we doing the dedication ! " Robinson says , pounding his fist on the table to reenact Lewis ' passion . <p> But Lewis was generous as well , giving $1 million to establish the foundation and to create the Flagler Garden , a magical woodland park along Ginter 's eastern perimeter . <p> Like a bloom , Lewis at last opened to the warmth of the place he helped create . <p> " Near the end of his life , his wife called one afternoon and said Lawrence would like to see the garden one more time , " Robinson says . He recalls meeting Lewis in the parking lot to give him a tour in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't good . You would push the pedal in and it would go pop-pop-pop-pop-pop , and then it would go . Here was a man who was literally dying of cancer and very wane and weak ; and so we spent probably about an hour driving around the garden . He kept wanting to see it time and again . " <p> At last , Lewis asked Robinson to return him to his car . <p> He was a man who was proudly a curmudgeon , Robinson says , assuming a growling voice to recall Lewis ' parting words : " Well , I 'm not going to give you another garden , but I damn well might buy you a new golf cart . He was terrifying at one level , but he was also a funny guy . " <p> A Beautiful Partnership <p> If Lewis was a looming figure in Robinson 's early history with the garden , Lora Robins was his foil . The wife of Claiborne Robins Sr. , she 'd also been involved with the garden from its founding in the 1980s and had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ force unto herself , " Robinson says , recalling that it had been about two months since his February 1992 arrival before she made her presence known to him . <p> " One day I got a call on my radio and they said Mrs. Robins is in your office and she would like to meet you , " Robinson says , his voice dropping dramatically with that last revelation . " She was sitting here and she said , Well , since you have n't come to see me , I 've decided to come and see you . ' " <p> There was a sparkle to her , and a spark between the two of them , but Robins , who was 80 at the time , was n't giving ground in that first meeting . <p> " She said , I came here for one purpose and that is to tell you that you should not waste your time coming and asking me for money , ' " says Robinson , who politely promised not to do so . <p> And what she 'd done already was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's challenge grant the year before . <p> By the end of the meeting , Robinson says , the two had " just hit it off , " and she decided to accompany him to an executive board meeting , where one thing led to another . After Robinson proposed that the board fund the creation of a small concession area , Robins pulled out her checkbook and inked a check for $35,000 . Within days she 'd upped the amount to $70,000 . And by the time it was all over , Robinson 's idea for a few tables , a coffee maker and a microwave had grown to the 70-seat Lora and Claiborne Robins Tea House with full-service dining . <p> " We developed over the years a very , very unique and wonderful friendship and appreciation of one another , " says Robinson , who sees Robins as the garden 's true spirit . <p> But This Is Richmond ' <p> When Robinson arrived , a master plan for the future of Lewis Ginter had the gardens looking more like Epcot Center than a botanical garden . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ green space , and a visitors center that looks more like a monorail station arcs around the perimeter . Circular lakes add to the space-age look . <p> " There was a lot of emphasis put on grand buildings , " says Robinson , who led an effort to refine the plan with a renewed emphasis on the gardens . Ironically , the grandeur of the plan was something that impressed Robinson when he was considering coming here . <p> " But it quickly became clear to me that a lot of people did n't have confidence in that plan , " he says . " Not publicly . Publicly everybody said , We 're going to build a world-class botanical garden . ' " Then , assuming a sotto voce , he says , " privately they would go , But this is Richmond . ' I was from New York , and I was going , what does that mean ? ' " <p> The new plan , greatly scaled back , met far more with Robins ' vision for the future . <p> So much so that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ donors in the rear to get them started giving . " She was n't afraid to be a pioneer , so as the newer plan evolved , she was willing to make the first big gift to start the visitors center , " he says . <p> That started as $3 million " from a woman who 'd just a few years earlier promised not a penny more " and eventually became $7 million as Robins put her money into ensuring that the facility would meet future needs . " She would say , We 've got to make it right . My name 's going to be on it . I want to have it right . ' " <p> As other donors saw her commitment , they began loosening their own purse strings . Within 10 years , the garden had raised $42 million . After Robins , " it was just sequential ; all the folks who 'd seen something on the plan that they were personally interested in or loved gave something . The Gottwalds funded the conservatory , the Masseys got behind the education complex @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " It just kept on flowing , " says Robinson . " Anne Massey gave the greenhouses 48 hours after Lora Robins gave the money for the visitors center . They all had the capacity and they all had the desire . They just needed the spark to make it happen . " <p> Shortly before Robins ' 2010 death , Robinson asked his partner in crime what kept her motivated and why she chose Lewis Ginter " and him " as her last big project . <p> " She said , I 've always loved gardens . ' That 's as straightforward as it needed to be for her . " <p> The Need for Gardens <p> The reason why communities need gardens is not so straightforward , though . It 's a question Robinson says he 's answered " a thousand times " but rarely the same way . <p> One reason is practical . Communities need gardens like Lewis Ginter as training grounds for organizations such as garden clubs and master gardeners . Virginia 's climate is in flux from season to season , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become more environmentally conscious , it also becomes a place for experimenting with new methods outside the comfort zone of manicured boxwoods and azaleas or seas of chemically sustained lawns . <p> It 's all these things . <p> In recent years , though , Robinson has begun to settle on a new answer : solace . <p> " I think the feedback from our visitors has increased considerably about this being a haven , a retreat , a place of peace and calm since the economic collapse , " he says . " We hear that all the time now . And we hear that from people of all ages " from parents with children who have various kinds of challenges , from returning veterans from the war with PTSD and brain injuries " that this is a place that they find peace . " <p> " Twenty years ago , we would not have identified that as a major part of what we are to the community , " Robinson says . " But today , it is very real . " <p> For nobody is that meaning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the summer of 2003 , Robinson , who was out of town on a business trip , received a call that changed his life . <p> It was about his older son , Alec . " He was in a bizarre automobile accident in Goochland County " driving 35 mph to meet a friend at a movie and went off the road through a livestock fence , " Robinson says , recounting the details of the night that Alec died . He was just 19 and fresh from his first year at James Madison University . <p> " There was no explanation why . They assume either a deer ran in front of him or something like that , " Robinson says . " But one of the boards of the fence came through the driver 's window and hit him ... and just killed him instantly . " <p> It was as if the world had come to a stop for Robinson . <p> " You search for answers and try to make sense of something like that , " he says . " He was very interested in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Geographic photographer had he ... he would be in the jungles of Africa and taking all kinds of wonderful pictures of things there . " <p> After Alec 's death , Robinson threw himself into the garden , or more accurately , the garden threw itself back at him . <p> " Life gets complicated , " he says . " When Alec died , the support that came from the donors and the staff and the volunteers , it was extraordinary . It was what got us through those really tough couple of years beyond his death . It was that that sustained us . " <p> And that salvation allowed Robinson to offer hope to others . <p> The night Alec died , Robinson had to answer another difficult phone call . This one came from Virginia Beach-based LifeNet , the organ agency that pairs with Richmond 's UNOS to offer life after tragedy . <p> " With Alec , he was already dead when the EMTs got there , so his major organs could n't be harvested , but a lot of his tissues and bones were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corneas , various major bones of the arms and legs , skin grafts and then connective tissues in the knees and things like that . He was able to donate those things . " <p> The call was a numbing experience , he recalls . <p> " Because of the litigious nature of our society , you have to actually approve each one of those kinds of donations , " he says . " So it 's basically like walking through a dissection of your child . " <p> But in the end , the experience did offer a small measure of comfort . And Robinson has remained a supporter . Each year for the past five years , Lewis Ginter has transformed itself into a memorial garden of sorts for an annual gathering of LifeNet survivor families . <p> But for true solace , Robinson returned to another place of gardens a world away . Japan again called to him . <p> In the years after Alec 's death , Robinson became aware of strange occurrences that were at once unsettling and reassuring . <p> " We had these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explained , " he says . " Coins showing up in unusual places " gosh , that was the most common of them . Fragrances that would come to you . Dreams that were unlike any other dreams that you 'd ever had . You wonder if you 're losing your mind or if you 're making these things up . <p> " As they continued to happen , I became more curious about them and about whether other people experienced them or not , " he says . " And I found that they were really pretty universal kinds of experiences . But no one talked about them because nobody wanted to be defined as crazy . I felt compelled to document them and ultimately to start to write about them . " <p> At the insistence of friends , and with the help of a grant from the Community Foundation , Robinson traveled to Japan , where he set about writing his recollections and documenting his and others ' experiences . <p> Japan , he says , " was kind of an obvious place to go . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , testament to a father 's grief and joy . It 's also , he says , meant as a conversation starter . <p> " When people do begin to talk about it , that 's when everyone says it 's real , " Robinson says . " We need to stick by those things . And there 's so much discomfort around those things . That 's the thing . People do n't find comfort in it because they think they should n't . " <p> Comfort is what Jack Berry needed in 2006 . Known to Richmonders as the head of Venture Richmond , Berry lost his son Brooks that year in a freak accident involving a fall down stairs . <p> " I barely knew Frank before 2006 . I knew him professionally a little bit , but , you know , I did n't know him very well , " Berry says . And yet , like one of those coins Robinson knows that his son leaves for him for comfort , Robinson turned up just when Berry needed him . " I 'll never forget @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there and feeling so grateful that a person I barely knew would come to my rescue . " <p> It 's a role that Robinson assumes for those who 've lost children . <p> For Berry , that willingness helped him survive . <p> " I latched onto Frank , " he says . We 'd cry together . He was a couple years ahead of me on this path that I was on . He taught me that it 's OK to cry every day , even at the most inappropriate times , because tears are simply an expression of love . He taught me to speak often about my son " to keep his memory alive " even if it makes other people uncomfortable . " <p> Wrapped in Comfort <p> It 's late January . The last strings of lights from GardenFest have been packed away , and the throngs of visitors have receded . With its barren branches and ground cracked from frost , the dormant garden is a place of potential , of life to come . But it 's always a place of comfort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he walks with short , confident steps along a path leading from the Bloemendaal House toward the visitors center . <p> " This is like my backyard , " Robinson says of the garden that 's been his second home for more than two decades . " The kids , because we lived in a house nearby for six months , they could ride their tricycles over here or whatever . <p> " They have these memories of what this place was like in the early days . It was theirs . We did n't have thousands of people walking through on a daily basis . And they got to watch all the big construction vehicles . " <p> He pauses and steps off the path . Assuming a place between a pair of hinoki cypress trees " twin , towering Japanese conifers " he looks small , but content . He smiles and comments on the placement of the two trees . <p> Of all the places of beauty within Lewis Ginter , of all the blooms and buds , this , he says , is his favorite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arents in the 1920s , one conifer has a bowed trunk that arcs like an upside-down question mark and disappears into layers of blue-green needles . <p> " They have these beautiful copper trunks on them .

@@59668367 @8668367/ <p> The economic earthquakes of 2008 took down a few of Richmond 's bona-fide business titans , from Circuit City to LandAmerica , but in their wake , the region 's entrepreneurial spirit has risen to fill the gap . While some small business ventures " bootstrap " their way from concept to corporation " funded only by their owners ' bank accounts " other local startups often need the help of so-called " angel " investors ready to offer guidance and infusions of cash.To gain some insight into the process , we talked with a handful of economic Johnny Appleseeds who are helping to cultivate Richmond into a capital city of another kind . <p> Andy Stefanovich <p> Lots of local startup investors profess their love for Richmond , but few do so as loudly or as proudly as Andy Stefanovich does . <p> " I just love Richmond , " says Stefanovich , who gained his own measure of financial comfort through advice and encouragement from the likes of Richmond business elites Jim Ukrop and Bob Mooney . " I got access to them , and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't pay that forward , we 've just not done the right thing . " <p> And doing the right thing starts at home for Stefanovich and his wife : " Jill and I have said Richmond is our home , and you invest in your home . I think it 's a moral commitment . " <p> Stefanovich looks at his startup investments as a three-pronged effort with a single goal " promoting Richmond to worldwide prominence as the capital city of creativity . <p> The first prong is New Richmond Ventures , better known as NRV , the new-business startup incubator that acts as financier , cheerleader and social conscience while focusing on local businesses with global market potential . He co-founded NRV two years ago with Mooney , Ukrop and former Land America CEO Ted Chandler . <p> " We 're building things that go out to the world , but Richmond gets the credit for it , " Stefanovich says , noting a special emphasis on making sure that the credit , when due , is also positive " and maybe even carbon-neutral . " They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good way . " <p> His second effort , Men in Shirts , looks inward a bit more , investing primarily in local businesses like its first undertaking , custom shirt company Ledbury , that are less about saving the world than they are about " a good story that adds to the fabric of Richmond . " <p> " It 's a kind of conglomeration of guys who really believe in Richmond , " he says . " We make modest investments . " <p> Stefanovich says the plan is to invest in three or four companies a year through Men in Shirts to the tune of $50,000 to $150,000 " in addition to a commitment from Stefanovich to put his mouth where the money is through valuable marketing and strategy advice . <p> " Our job as a small investment group is to tell the story , " he says , using as an example promotional efforts by the group for upstart Scott 's Addition brewery Ardent Craft Ales . <p> Stefanovich 's third prong is not so much about money as it is the value of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have an idea and help them to shape that idea and get it to a point where it 's ready to present to an NRV or Men in Shirts " or somebody else who can help take it to the next level . " <p> This third prong has become more structured in recent months , with Stefanovich launching his Feed &amp; Seed program , which seeks to give entrepreneurial sparks the fuel they need to catch fire , primarily in the form of ideas versus investment . <p> Stefanovich says Richmond itself is , in many ways , on fire with ideas and entrepreneurial promise right now . He calls it " attitudinal change . " <p> " When you create a critical mass at this level , people start to see and start to believe , " he says , suggesting that rather than being at the beginning of something great , Richmond is in the midst of a renaissance . <p> " Richmond 's a really beautiful town in that we have more access to each other than in most towns , " he says . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's our obligation to help you . When we 're asked , we line up . And I think that 's very different than in a lot of cities . " <p> Patrick Hull <p> It takes one to know one , and Patrick Hull knows entrepreneurs when he sees them . <p> " I got the bug when I was in college " I have never worked a real job , " says Hull , whose first business launched while he was still a construction management student at Virginia Tech . It came straight out of a need he heard from construction companies trying to bid on federal contracts . " One thing led to another That 's how I stumbled into entrepreneurship . I can thank God for what happened . " <p> So can the startups he 's been involved with since he began investing in the early 2000s . By 2008 , when he sold GetLoaded.com , an innovative freight-matching service for long-haul truckers , Hull says he made the move to " where my actual job was investing . " <p> " I bootstrapped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did have several investors in GetLoaded.com , but by then I had several companies behind me . But I think it depends on what you 're trying to accomplish whether you can bootstrap . " <p> Which is why he sees such a value in seeking out ideas " and idea creators " that could use a little lift . So far , he 's lifted " or tried to lift " more than 30 companies . <p> " Ultimately , I say investing in ideas is not really the point , " Hull says . " You need to have a good idea , but if I believe in the team , that 's what really matters . Can they get the right team around them and the right management to pull it off ? Businesses do n't buy anything , people do . " <p> This may explain Hull 's wide variety of interests " and investments . While many of his past entrepreneurial efforts have focused on freight logistics , he 's also explored lifestyle businesses , as was the case with his nutrition company . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I 'm far more prone to invest in a tech-oriented company . I think it 's because I feel comfortable in that space , and I understand how that works . " <p> With Hull , money is only part of his investment in an idea . " I would say I 'm more hands-on " I 'm more as an advisor , strategist , " he says . " I 'm more comfortable if I 'm engaged because most startups , the bulk of mine , are newer startups that do n't have any experience . I use my network of experts , and I help strategize . The No. 1 thing I think of first is : How do we get the money flowing ? That 's really where I like to focus . " <p> If an idea seizes his imagination , Hull is all in . " I 've got anywhere from $25,000 to $1 million in some deals . I 'm still in that bracket where I 'm an angel investor . " <p> And while right now many of Hull 's investments are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Richmond 's community of startup capital investors . As a contributing columnist for Forbes.com , he 's even used the power of the pen to express his belief in Richmond as a place where ideas find enthusiastic backing with a frequency that 's unique . <p> " You 've got a lot of community leaders from the older establishment , and their hearts are really into building up the town , " Hull says . " The momentum is really starting to pick up , and I think it 's just going to get stronger and stronger and stronger . " <p> Hull says one way to make it stronger is not only fostering talent as it comes to market but nurturing it even before it launches . <p> " There 's nobody supporting that stage between the idea and the business plan , " he says , talking about the importance not only of having a business plan but also having a proof of concept . " There 's nobody actually doing that . ... It makes me wonder how many ideas go by the wayside right now . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ideas often find their caffeinated spark at the bottom of a cup of coffee , so too do the best partnerships often launch over lattes , says Karen Booth Adams , perhaps one of Richmond 's most prolific pursuers of good startup opportunities . <p> " We got involved in investing in other people 's investments quite accidentally , " says Adams , one of three partners in Hot Technology Holdings , a company that 's often described as an incubator but is perhaps better explained as a one-stop shop that fosters talent while helping alleviate the stress of petty management chores so that ideas can grow . " We were all entrepreneurs that bootstrapped and then accidentally fell into investing . It was , Hey , can I have coffee ? ' and that 's quite literally how it started . " <p> Since that first cup of coffee , Adams counts 10 startups that she 's helped grow and foster before setting them free to soar on their own . <p> " I love startups , and I love being involved in the early stages , when most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Adams . " That 's the fun part : when you 're figuring out the name , what your brand 's going to be about , what your culture 's going to be . When it gets to where it 's more of an operational challenge , and you 're running the same model , that 's where it 's a lot less exciting . " <p> This may explain why Adams is so well known as a serial investor among Richmond startups , a community that she says is healthy and growing , especially among " early-stage investors " like herself who are willing to take a chance on something that 's not yet a household name , but that could be . <p> " Richmond is , I think , a very open-door culture for startup entrepreneurs , " she says . " It 's a lot harder in a lot of other markets to get in front of those early-stage investors . We 're fortunate in Richmond because it 's not difficult to sit down and have conversations with the early-stage investors . " <p> Adams ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equally important , she says , is that " we like to be involved in businesses that want to stay headquartered in Richmond but that are scalable well beyond Richmond . " <p> And while technology is her passion , Adams says , " there are some industries that we really love and that we seek out , like organic , healthy products , childhood online education " how to bring financial and real-world education concepts to K-12 " and fashion and design . " This last one is even a bit surprising for Adams . <p> " I do n't think people would naturally think of us as wanting to think of fashion , but we 've actually gotten fairly deeply involved in a couple of ideas , " she says . <p> Those ideas , all three of them , were based in New York or Los Angeles , and Adams says she 's committed to finding and funding someone 's fashion passion right here in RVA . <p> " I would love to find a Richmond-based startup that wants to do a lifestyle brand , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Equally unlikely , until you factor in that social-entrepreneurship angle that Adams finds so critical , are ideas focused on the country 's aging population . " I 'm very interested in how we take care of our elderly , " she says . " Anyone in Richmond who 's in that space , I 'm interested in talking to them if they have a scalable plan . " <p> As with her peers in the Richmond startup investment community , Adams says she remains as committed to strong business sense as she is to ideas . But the entire package has to have heart and soul , too . <p> " What gets me to where I want to give you money ? It 's probably several factors . I probably meet with 100 groups to get down to five that fit this criteria " the CEO and management team have to be authentically passionate about the mission of their startup , " she says . " They have to have a purpose that transcends just making money . " <p> John Kemper <p> John Kemper 's business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ top " to the point where he was able to throw an investor 's line to other entrepreneurs . " I spent over 40 years trying to create my own company , " says Kemper , who first built then sold his health-care consulting company , only to buy it back in 2002 then sell it again in 2010 to a private equity firm . <p> Though still involved in that business , Kemper now throws himself into his passion for helping young entrepreneurs build their own ideas . <p> " Richmond really has " and I do n't think a lot of people realize it " a lot of young people starting companies . It 's very exciting right now . " <p> Like Stefanovich , though on a more modest financial level , Kemper says he 's as focused on financial investments as he is on offering brand help and business planning advice . <p> " If it involves investment , then great , " he says . " But for me it 's about taking those ideas and moving them forward . To me , that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's eyes , good entrepreneurs first need a good idea , but even the best idea is doomed to failure if the people behind it lack the wherewithal to tackle the nuts and bolts of business . <p> " There are lots of people " not just Richmond , but anywhere " that have vision , " he says . " The key is being able to convert that vision and to implement . That 's where most companies stumble . Most visionaries are not implementers . You 've got to help them . Most small companies fail in the execution and implementation . That really is critical . " <p> To put it another way , Kemper says , " I really bet on the jockey , not the horse . If the person driving this , if that person is right and is smart enough to figure out what his or her strengths are and smart enough to bring on people who complement that strength , that 's what I 'm looking at . <p> " You can have the greatest concept in the world ; if the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happen . " <p> Kemper sees himself as a business advisor as much as he 's a career counselor . <p> " I always ask , What 's your end game ? ' " he says . For some , it 's about building a company and staying with it . Others want to grow an idea and then sell it . Others simply want to grow to the right size to provide an income for the founders and a few jobs for the community . <p> For Kemper , all are legitimate motivations for launching an idea . And more importantly , Richmond is a great launch pad . " Good quality of life , midsized , second-tier city , close to the beach and close to the mountains , even traffic-wise , " he says . " And there 's this energy that 's been created , I think ... and interest with lots of different people with creating these incubator-type organizations . They 're all over the map with what they 're doing . " <p> Kemper is fairly new to the startup investor game , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " I 've invested in two startups here , and I 'm looking at another one " and I 'm helping another , just giving them free advice about how she grows that business , " he says . " I 'm not looking to make a lot of money out of it . I get excited watching them take their vision and make it grow . It took me 40 years to get there " there 's got to be a shorter path than that . " <p> Tom Benedetti <p> Tom Benedetti is an investor of a slightly different breed . He 's not interested in your bright idea ; Benedetti wants proof . His Blue Heron Capital group is an investment firm that 's betting big money on making the next big thing even bigger . <p> " We invest in companies that are a little further along than startups , though I 've done some personal investment in startups , " says Benedetti , whose group " in spite of liking the idea " took a pass on such later winning local concepts as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little too risky at the time . They 've since proved out their concept , and I applaud them . But we 're looking for companies already just north of $2 million in revenue that are at profitability or a little ahead of that " where they 're just a bit beyond the enterprise phase . " <p> For Benedetti , this is a critical time in a business ' growth . And while that startup phase may hold the lure of romance and excitement , it 's this transitional growth phase when support is most critical to the stability " sometimes the survival " of a young company . It 's a point where they 're not quite big enough to attract the attention of big-money investors , but where they may be ready to take the leap , given a little help , to that point . <p> " We 're usually doing anywhere from $2 million to $5 million with each deal , " says Benedetti . " There 's a lot of companies out there that are sort of stuck in that $2 million to $4 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they can never get out of that because they do n't understand what it takes " to that point you 've been putting it together with baling wire and WD-40 and spit . And you need to take it to the next level . " <p> Blue Heron is the next level . Benedetti lists former Anthem , Genworth and Brinks CEOs among the investors his firm brings to the table . Those proven leaders are there not just to invest , but also to advise . <p> " That 's what attracts capital , is people who understand what they are , " Benedetti says , seizing on the startup investor analogy of betting on the jockey as much as the horse to note that it 's at this phase in the race where the horse matters most . " You ca n't have a horse that has no legs . " <p> And you ca n't win without feeding the horse , which may well be the most important piece of advice Benedetti offers to startups , both young and adolescent . <p> " A lot of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may run out of money " the market is just about to catch fire , and if you have n't been communicating with the investors , you may not be there when it does catch fire .

Bringing the newborn to the mom for skin-to-skin contact has been shown to help with initial bonding , says Dr. Janice Gibson-Neale of Manchester OB/GYN and Chippenham and Johnston-Willis hospitals , where " once the baby is born , there is a push toward early bonding with mom and dad . We try to include the family in everything . " <p> At Bon Secours hospitals , mothers " with the exception of those having a C-section " deliver and recover in the same room . " They can have whomever they want with them during birth , " says Mary Anne Graf , vice president of Women 's Services for Bon Secours Virginia . " After delivery , they have the magic hour , the first hour of bonding . When the baby 's eyes open , he or she is immediately searching for mother 's eyes . It 's almost spiritual .

Epidurals , which are injected in the lower back to help alleviate the pain associated with childbirth , are still the overwhelming choice for pain management . " It is very rare to have a patient that has complications from the medication , " Gibson-Neale says of epidurals . " Patients are screened for interaction . " <p> But epidurals are n't the only choice for pain management now . Bon Secours St. Mary 's Hospital is testing the use of nitrous oxide , commonly known as laughing gas . Nitrous oxide has been used safely during childbirth for more than 50 years . According to a report by the American Society of Anesthesiologists ' Committee on Obstetric Anesthesia , more than half of the women who go into labor in the United Kingdom use nitrous oxide . It is also widely used in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blend for childbirth " 50 percent nitrous oxide and 50 percent oxygen " helps to lessen the pain without the numbing effect of an epidural .

" This option is ideal for mothers who want to use their own resources as much as possible , " Graf says . " They only need help to get over the peak of contractions .

" <p> Waiting Game <p> In recent years , as demands on women 's time seem to have increased , some have been requesting to have their labor induced on a chosen day , so they can plan ahead . Elective inductions , however , are now being scaled back . " There has been a real emphasis in the medical obstetrics community toward allowing and supporting women to go into labor on their own , " says Dr. Katherine Czyszczon of the Virginia Women 's Center and Henrico Doctors ' Hospital . " We do our best to wait for the onset of labor whenever possible . " <p> Nonetheless , the number of induced deliveries has increased nationally over the past several years . Babies delivered through induction before 39 weeks of gestation may have to deal with a variety of health risks that would require neonatal intensive care services . And that concerns the obstetric medical community . According to The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists ( The College ) , nearly two-thirds of all U.S. hospitals handling non-emergency births have instituted policies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

" <p> To ' C ' or not to ' C ' <p> Obstetricians are also pushing for mothers to have vaginal births , if at all possible , rather than C-sections . In 2011 , one in three women in the United States gave birth by cesarean delivery , a 60 percent increase since 1996 , according to The College . Approximately 60 percent of those births were primary cesareans . This has caused concern that " cesarean delivery is overused without clear evidence of improved maternal or newborn outcomes , " The College says . <p> " We run into patients who really feel strongly they want to deliver by C-section .

" We have seen a great interest in breast feeding .

After Mooney 's entrance , the headlines quickly evaporated . Things got quiet . <p> Mooney was sold to the Richmond public and media as a numbers man . And that 's true ; Mooney looks every bit the mature , responsible finance exec he is " balding , with close-cropped silver hair , wearing glasses and a tasteful , muted gray suit that is well crafted but not ostentatious . <p> You have to look closer , though , to see the glimmers of the " real " Bob Mooney , perhaps down to the unusually colorful glass cufflinks he purchased from an artisan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the art forms that Mooney collects . <p> When it was announced that the CenterStage project would be taken over by the former head of Ethyl Corp. , some local arts fans worried what kind of project this would be .

" It was n't something I tried to promote , " he says . " I was always the acting executive director and not the expert executive director , if you will .

He 's presently treasurer and a member of the symphony orchestra 's foundation board . As a board member of TheatreVirginia in the 1990s , he helped make the difficult decision to shutter that venerable Actor 's Equity performing-arts institution because of a decline in fundraising and ticket sales .

" He 's a master gardener , he collects art and he 's been involved in the performing arts in any number of positions over the years .

" I do n't think the man sleeps , " Ukrop says . <p> A native Richmonder , Mooney grew up in South Side near the DuPont chemicals plant off the old Richmond-Petersburg Turnpike .

While he was in college studying accounting , he also spent many weekends in the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts . He enjoys discussing the various artists he 's seen and met , or shows he 's seen or museums he 's visited over the years . He 's a big fan of the jazz/world-music orchestra Pink Martini from Portland . <p> Mooney worked for Coopers &amp; Lybrand ( now PricewaterhouseCoopers ) from 1967 to 1997 in a variety of executive positions , climbing his way to partner in the firm 's New York City-based national headquarters in a little less than 10 years .

They have a daughter , Laura Markley , 24 , who works for PricewaterhouseCoopers in New York , and a son , Dr. David Mooney , 28 , a Virginia Commonwealth University School of Medicine graduate who is doing a residency in Alabama in hematology and oncology . <p> In 1997 , Bob Mooney went to work for Ethyl Corp . as its chief financial officer and a senior vice president .

" He was among the last of the generation that earned generous pensions from their former employers , and he receives retirement pay from PricewaterhouseCoopers as well as Ethyl Corp . He also currently holds a paid position as chief financial officer for the College of William &amp; Mary 's Mason School of Business . But Mooney spends an equal amount of his time on pro bono projects such as his work with CenterStage . Robinson says that in his years working with CenterStage , Mooney usually worked 8 to 10 hours daily as CenterStage 's volunteer executive director , often logging time on weekends , too . <p> " Bob Mooney never took a penny in salary " at CenterStage , Robinson says , adding , " Every now and then , he would turn in a little bit of mileage or receipts for taking somebody to lunch or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his own money in this organization .

Rick Warren , the evangelical preacher who delivered the invocation at President Barack Obama 's inauguration . <p> In a board room at CenterStage 's Carpenter Theatre , Mooney sketches a four-square diagram out on a piece of notebook paper . " I 'm a visual person , " he says , almost apologetically . The diagram is something that he makes everyone ( including himself ) fill out every week in the adult Sunday school class he teaches at Bethany Place Baptist , he explains . It 's a variant on a book titled Lead Like Jesus by Ken Blanchard that Bobby Ukrop introduced Mooney to when Ukrop brought Blanchard to Richmond for a seminar at First Baptist Church . It 's intended to make one think about how they 're living their life .

On the other hand , if you 've got a lot of confidence and you 're overly prideful , that probably does n't serve you real well in a community-leadership role or a biblical model either . " <p> The goal , explains Mooney , " is to be confident in who you are and what you 're doing and the mission that you 've got , but doing it with a sense of humility . " <p> And agree or disagree with their leadership styles , Richmonders should appreciate that the city has a lot of " servant leaders " who are doing good things for local organizations .

He humbly counts himself among that number . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's to be of service or to be a community servant and if we do that , you ca n't do it out of fear .

And that 's going without mentioning a bunch of other local businesses and nonprofits he 's been involved with , from C3 to Intelliject . <p> His tenure as CenterStage 's volunteer acting executive director is winding to a close as CenterStage plans to announce its hiring of a new executive director with an extensive arts background in March or April .

Then there 's CenterStage 's Genworth BrightLights Education Center , which has the ability to stream high-definition video of performances and events directly into local schools to help students meet various Standards of Learning . It got its first test during February 's " Sit In/Stand Out " commemoration of the 50th anniversary of the civil rights sit-in protests at the Thalhimers department store lunch counter . CenterStage filmed HD footage of interviews with the surviving protestors , which will be sent digitally to participating school systems . <p> Mooney appears most excited about this , but like a good servant leader , he tries not to look too proud .

She and Bauer sometimes ride together at the West Point stable where James boards her horses . <p> Mainly , though , they " go shopping a lot " and do " girl things , " Bauer says , like enjoying a night on the town in Shockoe Slip . " Every single time , there 's always someone who will recognize her , but she 's extremely gracious , " Bauer says . " Most of them want pictures and autographs . " <p> Speaking of which , James long ago drafted Bauer into helping sort and answer her volumes of fan mail . Most of it comes from younger fans who want autographed photos . Some send gifts like handbags and jewelry or even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what Bauer deems the " weird stuff . " James ' more amorous fans send her everything from marriage proposals and requests for lipstick imprints to invitations to hook up . " There 's a lot of I hope you can meet me here or there , ' " Bauer says , laughing . <p> James is " very , very family-oriented , " Bauer says , and she spends a lot of time with her extended family . Most weekends when she 's home , she attends services at Ladysmith Baptist Church in Caroline , where her father , Stuart , coaches youth basketball . ( It 's not unusual for her to wind up signing autographs for the kids and even some adults at church . ) <p> Born at Richmond Memorial Hospital in 1979 , Mickie James grew up in Hanover County 's Montpelier area . She was a tomboy who loved riding horses on her grandmother 's Caroline County farm . <p> Her mother , Sandra Knuckles , a Hanover County teacher and real-estate agent , and her father , Stuart , who 's retired from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paper Co. in Ashland , divorced when James was young . James has one full sister , a half-sister , a half-brother and three stepbrothers . ( " Holidays can get crazy , " she says . ) <p> Stuart James passed on his love of wrestlers like Blackjack Mulligan to Mickie and her two sisters . They grew up in the ' 80s era of Hulkamania , when the old World Wrestling Federation exploded into the merchandising mainstream with action figures , T-shirts and Saturday-morning cartoons . " I was n't a huge fan of Hulk . I loved the bad guys like Macho Man ' Randy Savage and Ric Flair , " James says . " Everybody else loved Hulk , so I was n't into him . Now I love him for what he 's done for the industry , but I was n't a Hulkamaniac . It 's funny : I 'm the good guy now , and I always loved the bad guys growing up . " The James girls gathered in front of the TV with their dad every Saturday evening to follow the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the TV screen and onto the living-room floor , where " all the girls would get together and wrassle me , " Stuart James recalls with a chuckle . <p> Describing herself as a natural " performer and clown , " Mickie James evinced an interest in entertaining from a young age , recording homemade mix tapes of herself singing Whitney Houston tunes on her boombox . <p> During high school , James worked summers as a lifeguard at Kings Dominion and waitressed at the Cracker Barrel in Ashland during the school year . She graduated from Patrick Henry High School in 1997 , one math credit shy of receiving the honors diploma she needed to seek a scholarship . " My family did n't have enough money to send me to college , and I was trying my hardest , " James says . She racked up more than enough credits but failed trigonometry , a required course for the advanced degree . <p> " I got out of high school with no direction , " James remembers sadly . Working at a bar in Shockoe , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew she liked wrestling told her about KYDA , a now-defunct school for aspiring wrestlers in Manassas . <p> But it was no easy jump into pro-wrestling fame . James ' story is one of long years of training , perfecting her art and pulling herself up the ropes until she made it to her feet . No Hollywood producer spotted her at a drugstore counter . No talent agency cast her . She made her own breaks . Mickie James is very much her own creation , and it 's doubtful anyone has ever labored harder to earn the scripted championship title . <p> Mickie James made her semiprofessional wrestling debut in 1999 at a National Guard Armory in " the middle of nowhere " ( actually in Staunton , Va. , but close enough ) , wrestling under the name " Alexis Laree " in an inter-gender tag-team match in front of a crowd of about 100 people . " I was by no means great , " she says , wincing slightly . " It was probably awful to watch , but it was fun because it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early 2000s , she was working the semipro circuit up and down the East Coast , competing for pro-wrestling promoters Ring of Honor . In 2002 , she was chosen to wrestle in the first pay-per-view match for the brand-new TNA Wrestling . Wrestling for about six months with TNA , James was partnered with male wrestler ( and future world champion ) Raven , and she was given a short-lived , pseudo-Goth image . <p> By 2003 , James caught the attention of World Wrestling Entertainment , the NFL of pro wrestling . She was sent to the WWE training school in Louisville , Ky. , for what was supposed to be a six-month stint before her television debut . But six months turned into two and a half years , during which James trained in vain as promised slots for her WWE debut came and went , watching as models and actors catapulted in front of her to the WWE big time . <p> Finally , she 'd had enough . Realizing she was lacking something the WWE wanted , James enrolled in acting and modeling classes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an emotional female fan/stalker . WWE liked the idea and wanted their writers to develop it for another wrestler already in the TV stable , but in a gutsy move , James made an impassioned plea directly to WWE CEO Vince McMahon . <p> " I walked right into Vince 's office and I said , Mr. McMahon , I heard you read my storyline , and I wanted you to know there 's nobody who can do that character better than me . ' " <p> McMahon told her he respected her for having the courage to make the pitch to him . <p> Then another six months passed . <p> " I was like , Oh , no , what did I do ? ' " James recalls . <p> Fearing that her dream of WWE fame might never materialize , she applied to start college online with American Intercontinental University . " Sitting in Louisville , there was no guarantee I would ever get brought to TV , " she says . <p> Then , on Oct. 9 , 2005 , the day her freshman semester began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ female wrestling . ( She still finished college online , earning a degree in business administration . ) <p> " It was one of those things where patience really pays off , " James says . " Even though I was supposed to debut many times before , any of those ways I was supposed to have debuted would have paled in comparison to this angle . " <p> The fictional Mickie James started out as what James describes as a " Punky Brewster/ Single White Female -type character , " a girlish super-fan stalking the WWE 's reigning female champion , the blonde bombshell Trish Stratus . Over the course of a yearlong storyline on the weekly WWE Smackdown and Raw TV shows , James obsessively pursued Stratus and was repelled by the object of her affection . In an unusual first for televised wrestling , there was no attempt at hiding what James calls " the lesbian angle . " Pushing the envelope during a controversial Christmas broadcast , James told Stratus to look up at a sprig of mistletoe hanging overhead and then pulled Stratus ' face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , reluctant champ 's lips . ( A YouTube video of the moment has logged 2.3 million views . ) <p> At first , James ' character wanted to be loved by Stratus . Then she wanted to be Stratus , putting her energy into wresting the title belt from her former idol . As a WWE character , Mickie James was intended to be a villain , a heel , a bad guy . But a funny thing happened along the way : The crowd split into Team Mickie and Team Trish . <p> " Nobody expected that " it was kind of cool , " James says . " It was probably the biggest storyline that they had done with any female in years . " The pair got unprecedented screen time for female wrestlers . <p> " It 's such a male-dominated industry , " James says , " and we bring everything we have to prove that we 're just as good and rough and tough as the guys . Throughout the years , women wrestlers have been stigmatized as just cute to look at so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you are and a performer , it 's something special . " <p> Off-screen , James remains friends with Stratus , who 's now retired from wrestling . But a hint of real-life resentment crops up ever so slightly when James recalls how some fans were incensed that she would dare to take the championship belt from Stratus , " their all-American girl , " noting with a touch of sarcasm that Stratus is in fact a Canadian whose background was in modeling , not wrestling . ( Stratus did not return calls for comment . ) <p> On April 2 , 2006 , at Chicago 's Allstate Arena , Mickie James took the stage versus Trish Stratus for the female world championship in front of a crowd of more than 17,000 fans at WrestleMania 22 . Giant posters of both women hung from the ceiling . James ' mother sat in the front row . " WrestleMania is like our Super Bowl , " James says . " It 's our World Series . It 's the biggest show of the year , and everybody wants to be on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gone from wrestling at the Staunton National Guard Armory to winning the WWE Women 's Championship . " I was crying my eyes out , " she recounts . " This was something I had dreamed about as soon as I set foot in a wrestling ring . " <p> Yes , it was scripted . Yes , James knew before she went in the ring that she would win . But you do n't become champ unless you 're worthy of the title , she reasons . <p> " You have to recognize the fact that it is acting , and the reason you won it is because of the culmination of this amazing storyline , " she says . " It 's cool to be the champ , but you know it 's not like you 're going out and winning a boxing championship where you trained legitimately and won it . " Still , " they would n't put the championship on you if they did n't know you could hold it . It 's an honor and privilege . " <p> Wrestlers are gifted athletes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The goal is to make it look real while also making sure no one is really hurt . When it works , James says , it 's like dancing with a great partner . When it does n't , things can go south quickly : James herself has been knocked unconscious in the ring because her foot slipped . Trish Stratus suffered a dislocated shoulder during one of their bouts . <p> In late February 2010 , James forgot to wear her kneepads when she was practicing at an arena in Texas , and she suffered an abrasion to her knee , which became infected with MRSA , an extremely virulent staph infection . She became sick to her stomach and had trouble walking ; her knee swelled as big as her thigh . " I had no idea the severity of this infection or what it could do , " James says . " It was in my joints . It was underneath my kneecap . I could have lost my leg from the knee down . " James was rushed home for an operation in which her kneecap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ IV antibiotics <p> for weeks . <p> With WrestleMania fast approaching , James ' character was written out of scripts , with no onscreen comments about why she was MIA . " It was out of sight , out of mind , " James says . " It was a very eye-opening experience . " ( WWE and McMahon declined to comment for this article . ) <p> James worked hard to heal , and within a month , she returned to Smackdown and Raw just in time to make what would be her final Wrestlemania appearance . Soon afterward , as she was driving home from a promotional morning-radio interview on Richmond 's WRXL 102 on April 22 , WWE called and said they were letting her go . They wanted to move in a different direction . " I was like , Wow , OK , that stinks . ' " <p> Fortunately , James had more than one folding chair in her wrestling ring . <p> In 2009 , she began laying the groundwork for a career as a country-music singer . Her debut album , Strangers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Dolly Parton 's 2008 album Backwoods Barbie ) , came out in early 2010 . CMA Close Up magazine , the Country Music Association 's industry publication , highlighted James as an up-and-coming act to watch in a recent issue . At her debut concert during a benefit in Nashville in February 2010 , she opened up for country superstars Rascal Flatts . James is working on a follow-up album now , collaborating with Richmond band 4Play , and she plans a national tour in 2011 . <p> At her album-release party in Nashville last summer , one of her well-wishers was Dixie Carter , president of TNA wrestling . By August , Carter was texting happy birthday wishes to James . In September , it was announced that James had returned to the TNA wrestling stable . She 's now filming for its weekly iMPACT ! TV shows and cable pay-per-view episodes out of Universal Studios in Orlando , Fla . She 'll also be touring with TNA about 150 days a year , a schedule that will leave her with time to pursue singing . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " says Carter , who is supportive of James ' dreams to expand her fame to country music . TNA has already produced a music video of James performing a song titled " Hardcore Country ! " to introduce her matches " and she now sports a country/western look with Native American touches , a nod to her Powhatan ancestors . <p> Carter could see James becoming the female equivalent of Dwayne " The Rock " Johnson if that 's what she wanted to do . After all , James has flirted with acting before , from a guest role as a roller-derby star on an episode of USA 's TV series Psych to a stint guest-hosting an episode of VH1 's Celebrity Fit Club : Boot Camp . <p> " She 's got the main thing you need , and it 's the drive , and so once you have that and that determination , I think it will be hard to stop her from accomplishing great things out of wrestling , " Carter says . " She 's in the prime of her career and she is very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in TNA wrestling , and in the few weeks she 's been with us , she 's done just that . " <p> As always , James remains ambitious . Her goal for now , she says , is to become the " first female to hold every prestigious women 's championship " in the pro-wrestling world , which includes TNA 's Women 's Knockout Championship belt . At press time , she was ranked the No. 1 contender for it .

In the foreground are their three daughters , Burwell , Nancy and Meadie . Photo courtsey Mary Roach <p> When Edwin and Meade Laird moved permanently into their Midlothian home , Pinifer Park , there was still some work to do . After all , the Queen Anne-style house was the Lairds ' second home , a summer getaway . <p> They took up residence there in 1912 , two years after the home was built , but they would need a heating furnace and insulation installed to make it through the colder months . Edwin and Meade were building a family and transitioning from an urban lifestyle " staying the majority of the year in a rented Park Avenue home in Richmond " - to more sedate surroundings.The century-long history of Pinifer Park ( pronounced PINE-uh-fer ) is one of the highlights of this year 's Richmond Symphony Orchestra League ( RSOL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every other year . <p> Pinifer Park was originally built in 1910 , and it includes a central interior modeled after a New England hunting lodge .

The paneling throughout the house is from those trees . <p> During Pinifer Park 's first two years , the family spent winters in their Park Avenue home and later in various homes on Monument Avenue because their children were attending local schools .

" No iron beds for them ! " <p> The home was also a pioneer in modern technology . In 1912 , it became the first house beyond Bon Air to have telephone service . The Lairds let William T.

@@59668406 @8668406/ <p> Midlothian 's David Buckley was diagnosed totally disabled by post-traumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) in 2008 , 17 years after witnessing the mortal wounding of his best friend , David Wieczorek , 21 , while they served in Iraq during Desert Storm . This two-part series examines how Buckley and his family cope with his PTSD and how he was thrown an unexpected lifeline in March . <p> **28;257;TOOLONG <p> David Buckley blinks back tears .

I have photos of him that I 'd like them to have . " <p> The same day a ceasefire was called , Buckley 's best friend , David Wieczorek , stepped on an unexploded bomb fragment that cost him his life . Buckley was several yards away from him and was not injured . Another soldier lost a leg , and a third suffered a leg wound .

Get down . ' It was loud screaming , like what you would see in the movies . So he 's yelling and he 's on top of me , and he 's got his hand up like a gun , making sounds like a machine gun . Then he started doing radio communications and codes . " <p> Tami ca n't remember if the episode lasted two minutes or an hour . Finally , after David uttered some military term , he released her and sat on the bed staring at her , physically present but mentally absent . In a world of constant nightmares , this one proved to be the worst . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she says . " They should film at our house . " <p> **28;287;TOOLONG <p> Because they share a first name , Buckley thinks of Wieczorek every time he hears his own name . He has attempted suicide twice . " Do I have a suicide plan ? No . Do I think about it ? Every day . " <p> Buckley also struggled professionally for years , working as a deputy for the Hanover County Sheriff 's Department , as an express delivery driver and as a Coca-Cola account manager before being declared 100 percent permanently disabled by PTSD in December 2008 . <p> For those coping with the disorder , which often manifests itself after someone has experienced combat or a traumatic incident , seeking adrenaline rushes is symptomatic . " As odd as it may sound , these soldiers tell me they never felt more alive than in combat , so going to work , church , taking care of kids just does n't do it for them , " says Dr. John Benesek , a clinical psychologist and director of McGuire VA Medical Center 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ running into a burning house and pulling people out . It 's positive , because they 're selflessly trying to rescue someone , but negative because it takes situations like this to help them break out of emotional numbness . " <p> Buckley had changed jobs several times , which is a hallmark of PTSD . " I always excelled and moved up quickly , but I would eventually cave in with the day-to-day stress . When 9-11 happened , that really affected me . The straw that broke the camel 's back was when I broke my ankle on the job as an account manager/merchandiser for Coca-Cola . During the recovery , I got very depressed , and it all went downhill fast and quick . " <p> For Buckley , part of that descent included mixing alcohol with medication . He has prescriptions for 13 drugs , seven for PTSD . <p> Dr. Maurice S. Fisher Sr. was one of the first psychologists to treat Buckley when he admitted himself voluntarily to St. Mary 's Hospital in mid-2004 after a series of unrelenting traumatic dreams . Fisher says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alcohol with drugs : " They do n't use logic . It 's self-medication . They drink to help themselves feel better . " <p> Fisher , who now works for Comprehensive Counseling in Roanoke , does n't mince words . " People can say all they want about the military keeping peace , but they 're training killers , and they do n't offer any cross-training because there is none . There 's no real integrative counseling to help them get back into society , particularly for those who have seen combat . " <p> Buckley sought help at McGuire VA Medical Center in Richmond for several medical issues in February 2005 . At McGuire , Buckley started attending PTSD counseling sessions with Benesek . " When you and I are cut off in traffic , we might get angry , but these guys see it as a threat , " Benesek says . " Some may be apt to follow the people and pull them out of cars . Their perception is skewed . The key to PTSD is learning to adapt their skills and mindsets to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> For instance , Buckley reacts to sounds in daily life that mimic combat . " There are so many triggers , like seeing fire or hearing a jackhammer on a street , which sounds exactly like a machine gun , " he says . " Believe it or not , the smell of feces is another . In Iraq , we had to burn the feces . It 's something you never forget . " <p> Buckley spends a lot of time at McGuire , often going five days a week . Along with counseling sessions and group therapy , he recently joined an indoor biking program and weight-lifting class . It was a switch from riding horses , something he did at Lonesome Dove , a nonprofit organization in Powhatan that provides therapeutic riding for veterans . Buckley won national riding awards before trading his horse for a bicycle , after recent surgery on his feet . " The stirrups gave me a fit , but I can ride a bike with no problem . " <p> One problem Buckley and his family have faced is how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his wife and children agreed to be interviewed . Tami encountered women at a local church who , after learning of Buckley 's issues with PTSD , suggested that she should leave her husband . " I was stunned , " Tami says . " I asked those women , If David had cancer , would you suggest I leave him ? ' I told them that he did n't ask to have PTSD and that I did n't see the difference between cancer and PTSD . I never went back to that church . " <p> **28;317;TOOLONG <p> Buckley had dreamed of becoming a soldier since he was young . " I volunteered in 1988 , right after I graduated from Midlothian High School . As far back as I remember , I wanted to be a soldier and experience combat . " He pauses .

" A few weeks later , I told him that I loved him , too , " Tami says . " He had killer eyes and a wonderful smile , the best thing since peanut butter .

" <p> " For instance , this past Christmas was amazing , " she says . " The first part of December was rocky , but David managed to hold himself together . There was just peace . We did n't fight for a month after the first week of December . I ca n't tell you how long it 's been since that happened . " <p> Good intentions gone wrong is how Buckley might describe his days . " I just can not make it 24 hours without having a blowup over something . I try so hard to be good , but there are always trigger points . If one of my children gets hurt , or my wife " even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first reaction is anger . I blame myself for not being able to prevent the incident , which goes back to Iraq . I used anger to deal with awful things in the military , like my best friend 's death . I blame myself for that , too . " <p> Following a morning ceasefire , the two Davids were among a group of soldiers from the Army 's 1st Battalion 5th Cavalry , known as the Knights of the Desert , who were exploring the terrain . <p> " We had arrived the night before in an area near Kuwait . A bunch of us were just checking out the area the next morning . You 're trained to listen to your gut in the military . My gut told me we should turn back , but I did n't listen . We just kept walking , looking into bunkers . Even though I was only a corporal , I was the top officer , so I feel responsible for what happened . I was standing fairly close to David when the bomb fragment went off , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I feel like I ca n't ever let my guard down , that I should be able to prevent people from getting hurt , especially my family and people I love . " <p> Buckley 's concern manifests as anger , which spills over frequently . " If my dad gets upset , it affects the outcome of the day for the entire family , " Austin says . " For years and years it happened on a daily basis , as far back as I can remember . It 's not as bad now ; he 's gotten a lot better . I think him finding Jesus in his life and properly taking his medicine and cutting back on drinking has helped . He used to have a problem with overdosing his medicines and drinking . " <p> The simplest things seem to set Buckley off . " If I do n't brush my teeth before , instead of after , I eat breakfast , it creates a huge argument , " Austin says . " It 's such a small thing , but he has to control @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mom . He ca n't control her , though , and it causes arguments . Usually it ends up that they just walk away from each other for a little bit , then they come back . My dad is usually the instigator . He does n't like to drop an argument . He likes to pursue it and keep going until it 's fixed . Usually we ca n't fix it . We just move on to the next one . " <p> While Tami is pleased with the counseling her husband has received at McGuire , she is concerned about the number of prescriptions he has . " David has received wonderful counseling from John Benesek , " she says . " I do n't know what we would have done without McGuire . However , I think David is over-medicated . It takes a huge amount of medication to get him to sleep . His body fights against sleep , and without medication , it can be unbearable . It 's a double-edged sword . " <p> Tami loves her husband deeply , but dreads the ups @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has such a good heart . I do n't want people reading this to think that we 've never had any good times . We have some wonderful memories , but PTSD is a horrible stressor on marriages and families in general . Sometimes we both wonder if we 're going to make it . " <p> Some relief has come from attending family camps sponsored by the Virginia Wounded Warriors , a program established in 2008 to improve and expand services to veterans and family members whose lives have been affected by stress-related injuries or traumatic brain injury . Recently , Tami has received counseling through the program and has made appointments for family counseling services there , too . <p> Even with the counseling and multiple drugs , Buckley is hyper-vigilant , always watching and listening . " He 'll run outside , thinking he 's heard something , " Tami says . " To be the spouse of someone with PTSD , there is just no peace , no calm . Austin has said , No worries . Dad 's always on patrol . I pity somebody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' " <p> **28;347;TOOLONG <p> As the anniversary of his best friend 's death approaches every year , Buckley 's dreams become almost constant , and his daily life unravels even further . <p> " It starts about October , goes through Christmas , which pretty much messes up the holidays every year , and then gets really bad at the beginning of the new year , " Buckley explains . <p> That Feb. 28 date grabs hold of him like quicksand every year , but this year he received a lifeline of sorts a few days before the anniversary arrived . <p> Since 1991 , David had n't had much contact with his Army buddies . He traveled to Las Vegas for one friend 's wedding soon after discharge , and recently he had found two friends on Facebook . He had wanted to send photos of his friend to Wieczorek 's family , but had been unable to locate any of them . <p> During research for this story , the writer discovered and showed Buckley an online 1991 obituary for David Wieczorek . Oddly , a comment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : <p> " I would first like to extend my deepest sympathies to the Wieczorek family .

It has taken me over 20 years to talk about this incident and I have thought about David every day for the past 22 years . We did everything we could to try to save David that afternoon . He was a great soldier and he was well liked by everybody in our unit . I hope that my posting this note does not bring back any pain for anyone . I have just not been able to find a way to discuss this sensitive topic without feeling extreme pain .

Richmond Lodge No. 13 ( later renumbered to No. 19 ) was chartered out of the Grand Lodge in Williamsburg ( founded in 1777 ) on Dec. 28 , 1780 . The Revolutionary War delayed formalization of the Richmond Masons , who probably met in a private schoolhouse then next door to the present hall . More space was soon needed . The Masons bought the lot from tavern keeper Gabriel Galt on Aug. 12 , 1785 . Galt , himself a Mason , sold the property to a group that included Alexander Mc-Robert , merchant and Richmond mayor ( 1789-1790 ) . Galt died in 1788 .

Residing in Richmond as a lawyer , he later served on Aaron Burr 's successful defense counsel in his 1805 treason trial .

Robinson 's white agent , Marty Forkin , told a tale in which he was dining at The Jefferson , and after some slight , Robinson spilled soup on him . Somehow out of this , Forkin decided to sign Robinson to a contract . Robinson danced at The Jefferson for the 1933 Beaux Arts Ball , though Jim Crow laws prevented him from staying there as a guest . The same weekend he came to perform for the ball , he inaugurated the traffic light where his statue stands today . <p> Robinson gave huge amounts to black charities and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ America . He co-founded a Negro Leagues Baseball team , the New York Black Yankees . He also fought in World War I as a member of New York 's 369th Infantry , known as the " Harlem Hellfighters . " His role in advancing dance and the place of blacks in film is what led dancer Gregory Hines to create a 2001 television movie about Bojangles . <p> But in changing social times , the " Bojangles " persona became problematic . Lena Horne , miscast alongside him in Stormy Weather as a love interest despite a near-half-century of age difference , did n't care for him . In Horne 's biography , Robinson is described as a purposeful subservient who carried a pistol , was poisonous to other blacks " and truly believed in the wit and wisdom of little Shirley Temple .

The American entertainment machine of the Great Depression in the 1930s latched onto Temple 's dimples and vivacity to make her the best-known person in the world . She was trained to entertain , but when the lights went out and the cameras did n't roll for her anymore , she did n't crack up , or end up as carrion for tabloid vultures to pick over . Still , it was n't easy . <p> Her first marriage dissolved , and her later films failed to make money , in large part because the studios did n't know how to cast a former little girl who 'd grown into a young woman . She did some television , but that did n't work well , either . <p> In her autobiography , Child Star , she recalls meeting " Uncle Billy " again in 1949 in Los Angeles , where he 'd come for a one-night charity performance . He downplayed her impending divorce decree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was happily remarried and had adopted a daughter . But , Robinson added , his new wife could n't dance . He " cocked his head sideways and flashing that same wide-eyed , toothy smile so indelibly printed in childhood memory , " she wrote . <p> " I 'm in hard times now , and gray , too , " he told Temple . He ran one hand over his head . " But after all , I 'm seventy-one . " <p> The former co-stars reminisced until Robinson gave " a delighted , rolling chuckle " and said , " Both of us came a long way since that first staircase dance in 1934 . " <p> Robinson died soon afterward , on Thanksgiving Day 1949 . A brass band led the funeral cortege . " What they played was not a dirge , however , " Temple wrote , " but music Uncle Billy would have wanted , dance music , in slow motion .

The star-studded roster of mourners included Bob Hope , Duke Ellington , W.C. Handy , Eddie " Rochester " Anderson and Irving Berlin . <p> Temple re-started her life through California politics , which led to appointments and ambassadorships to the United Nations and Ghana . She became the first female White House chief of protocol and arranged Jimmy Carter 's inauguration . <p> After a breast cancer diagnosis and a mastectomy , she was one of the first prominent women to speak about her experience .

Dr. Richard Lower , a surgeon at MCV , became one of just a handful of doctors nationwide to have performed the procedure . <p> Today , there 's no shortage of medical distinctions among Central Virginia 's major hospitals , which are continually vying to bring other medical " firsts " to the region . Bon Secours , for example , is the only health system in Virginia to offer a 30-minute guarantee of being seen in its emergency department . <p> Bon Secours St. Mary 's Hospital ( 5801 Bremo Road , 285-2011 , bonsecours.com ) was the first hospital in Virginia and one of the first U.S. centers to offer a new incisionless procedure to reverse complications that can occur after gastric-bypass surgery . The procedure , coined ROSE ( restorative obesity surgery , endolumenal ) , reduces the size of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small intestine to its original post-gastric-bypass proportions . <p> " Gastric-bypass patients work very hard to manage their weight and adjust their lifestyle after surgery , " says Dr. Gregory L. Schroder of Richmond Surgical Bariatrics Group at St. Mary 's . " Sometimes , through no fault of their own or their surgeon , the benefits of the bypass procedure start to fail , and they begin to regain weight and the problems associated with it . " <p> St. Mary 's also leads the way in Virginia with single-incision laparoscopy surgery ( SILS ) for gastric-band weight-loss procedures and other gastrointestinal issues like gallbladder removal and appendicitis . In addition , St. Mary 's was the first hospital in the United States to perform a new adjustable gastric-band procedure using the REALIZE Adjustable Gastric Band-C . Within Richmond the hospital has also pioneered the use of a cooling-blanket therapy to treat infants born with brain trauma ; and St. Mary 's is the local standard-bearer for an advanced technique for coronary bypass surgery called TECAB " totally endoscopic coronary artery bypass surgery . TECAB surgery improves blood flow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that it is performed through four to five fingertip-size slits with the help of the da Vinci robot , rather than the traditional open-chest surgery that impacts the breastbone. - The benefits , hospital officials say , include faster recovery time and less risk of complications . <p> To date , Johnston-Willis Hospital of CJW Medical Center ( 1401 Johnston-Willis Drive , 330-2000 , cjwmedical.com ) is the only hospital in the region with both the Gamma Knife and Trilogy technologies .

Lifesaving drugs and a healthy lifestyle staved off the inevitable for two decades . None but his closest family knew . But nothing lasts forever . <p> " He did n't let on to anybody , " Kacani says . " And you could n't tell . You would never have known " and he did n't even really know how serious it was . He would have a pain " maybe it was from playing soccer , and he would maybe take a Tylenol " which is perfect for the liver .

" This kind of disease does n't improve as you get older . That 's why it got to the point where the only alternative was organ transplant . " <p> In fact , when Felix was told his liver was near done , it really was very near indeed . <p> " The next step in this disease would have been cancer , " says Kacani . " Once that happens , it 's a quick progression to death . " <p> Felix was placed immediately on the organ transplant list , stepping into a long queue to await a chance at survival , dependent not only on another 's misfortune but also on that person 's physiology . A donor 's blood type and other markers determine whether a prospective liver might live and function properly . <p> But he still did n't reveal his plight beyond his nearest and dearest . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tested to see if they could be live organ donors . The liver is the only human organ capable of growing back to nearly its full size if a portion is removed . The transplanted organ similarly grows to nearly full size . <p> " My immediate response was not to call everybody I knew , saying please help me , " says Felix , who hoped one of his siblings might be a match , but who did n't know it was even a possibility to look outside his family for a donor . His wife , Trish , another UR alum , was too small even to hope to be considered . <p> " I really was n't aware of the whole living donor transplant thing , and I just figured my brother who is similar age , similar size , etc. , would be a match , " Felix says . As it turns out , the Big Swede was too big .

" People commented I still had my tan in December . " They mostly did n't comment on the fact that the whites of his eyes had taken on a disturbing sepia tint . <p> At last , Felix decided there was at least one group he 'd have to tell : his over-40 recreational soccer league team . " I sent the organizer an email saying I 'm not going to be playing because I 've got some health issues . " <p> The organizer sensed there was more to the story . He pried , Felix says , finally getting the full story from his stricken teammate .

At last , the email landed in Kacani 's inbox . <p> " I 'll never forget it , " says Kim Kacani , Pat 's wife , who 'd hosted Felix during his visit to Richmond two years earlier , and who 'd suspected nothing of her husband 's friend 's condition at the time . " I was at the mirror putting on my face and he said , I just got an email . Matt needs a liver transplant . ' " <p> The moment sent a chill through Kim . Two years earlier , her husband had seemed less likely to be an organ donor candidate , and more likely to be on his way to being a future recipient himself . <p> " Patrick had had a bad physical , " she says , remembering the prognosis that stunned both of them . Already parents of two teens , they 'd recently added a young daughter , Mollie-Aidan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high triglycerides , overweight and staring at a three-generation Irish family history of becoming beholden to alcohol , " Kim says . " He said , I 'm done , ' and he quit drinking , started eating right and lost 30 pounds . " <p> Standing that morning in the shower , Pat Kacani may well have been in the best shape he 'd been in since he shared the UR soccer pitch with Felix . " I 'm sitting there going , So that 's what this was about , ' " Kim Kacani says . " It 's this overwhelming sense of " I ca n't explain it , but he said it : I knew I 'd be a match . I knew I 'd be doing this . ' You ca n't explain the feeling . " <p> Her husband , speaking with an almost religious reverence , had already committed to sacrificing a part of himself to save his friend . <p> If live kidney donation today ranks as almost routine " there were more than 6,000 live-donor donations in 2011 , mostly of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Live liver donations between non-family patients are even rarer , says Joel Newman , a spokesman with Richmond-based United Network for Organ Sharing , better known as UNOS , which coordinates the entire U.S. organ transplant system . UNOS does n't coordinate live organ donations , but it does maintain statistics , and those statistics paint a picture of just how unlikely it is that Kacani 's liver would have a chance to play the hero . <p> " The kidney transplant surgery is " it 's relatively uncomplicated , " Newman says . " The liver does have some greater risk . I would n't oversell that , but there 's a lot of blood flowing through the liver . It 's harder for the liver to recover if there 's damage done . " <p> That added risk crystallized with the medical community in the early 2000s . <p> A series of live-donor deaths led surgeons to re-evaluate the process for prequalifying prospective donors , especially those not related by blood or marriage . <p> In the peak year , 2001 , there were 524 live-liver transplants nationwide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ UNOS has compiled full numbers , there were 247 . The vast majority were from parent to child . Of a total of 28,537 U.S. organ transplants performed that year , about 6,000 were liver transplants , an indication of just how rare live-liver transplants have become . And the need far outweighs the supply : More than 15,000 people are on the liver waiting list in any given year . <p> Part of the reason live donation is so rare is that in addition to confirming a physical match , physicians now insist on an expanded battery of psychological " and even financial " tests to ensure the donor is fully apprised of the level of their commitment . <p> Even after a physical match is found , other qualifying factors mean there 's only about a 20 percent to 30 percent chance a live donor will meet all the criteria . <p> " There 's no organ for which we do n't have a shortage of donors , " Newman says . " There 's a shortage for all organs . But at least with kidney transplants , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and some of the other organs , there 's really no feasible long-term backup . If you get to a certain point of liver or heart or lung failure , the patient will die . " <p> The Kacanis were intimately aware of the danger their friend faced . Kim describes herself as an obsessive researcher who started looking into Felix 's condition " and her husband 's risks " almost instantly . But even after hearing the statistics , Pat Kacani never wavered . <p> " I am a witness to his calm , though I was a freak show , " says Kim Kacani , normally a bubbly complement to her husband 's reserve . She takes on a sober air when considering the one factor that firmed her husband 's resolve . " At the end of the day , every conversation we had , it came back to being , Can you imagine being Trish with three children and your husband getting that kind of a report , having your family exhausted and having no options ? ' " <p> And so Pat Kacani had no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his hat into the ring . <p> " All through the process , they 're telling me 20 percent chance : He 's a big guy , and you 're not so big , " Kacani says . " Everything might be perfect , but you may not be big enough . " <p> Indeed , the size difference between the two men meant without a doubt that Felix would need the majority of Kacani 's liver . About two-thirds of it , to be exact . And for that to happen , Kacani 's total liver would need to be big enough that he 'd have at least 30 percent of the organ left at the end of the operation . <p> " They kept telling me that , and they kept saying , You may not be a match , ' " Kacani says . " I kept saying , If I 'm not a match , I 'm going to be pissed . ' " <p> Making the entire procedure even less likely was Kacani 's recent past . He 'd gone cold turkey , but he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happy to lift a pint : " People were like , You ? You 're giving your liver ? ' " <p> As it is , there had been two other prospective donors ahead of Kacani . Both looked promising . Both made it through all the first and most critical parts of the screening . <p> Back in New Jersey , with each prospective donor , Felix says , he tried not to get his hopes up too high . He 'd already been disappointed after news that neither of his siblings were candidates , " and as my wife likes to say , even after you pass the test , the doctors , they do everything they can do to talk you out of it , " he says . <p> Felix is n't kidding . Once all other testing is done , including that battery of psychological tests and a thorough review of a candidate 's financial health ( to ensure they 're prepared to weather a stretch of time where they may need to miss work ) , perhaps the most grueling test remains . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This is a period after the prospective donor is a match when the hospital team literally goes on radio silence . <p> The phone stops ringing . No emails come .

Waiting as cold feet set in . <p> And so it went with the first prospective donor , the father of one of Felix 's son 's friends in a soccer league . <p> " Even though we were n't that close , he was really committed and said , I would never want my son 's friend to grow up without a dad , ' " Felix says , recalling his short-lived elation after all the testing was done . But the cone of silence ended that . <p> " A couple of weeks later , he said , Matt I 'm getting kind of cold feet here . ' They really do put the fear of God in you . " <p> Felix 's own brother-in-law also made it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ psychological stare-down . He blinked . <p> It 's hard to explain the flood of constant emotions for a person facing his own mortality as hope after hope falls through . It 's a harder thing still for that person to find a place of peace with healthy and qualified donors who ca n't quite bring themselves to make the sacrifice . <p> Felix says he found that place of understanding , which he best describes through an analogy . <p> " Three buddies go out drinking , and one says , I 'm going skydiving tomorrow . ' And the other two say , Oh , I 'll go with you , ' " Felix says . " Well , the first thing is , you 've got to wake up early the next day and go to a three-hour class . And the first guy drops off . Then the two guys left go up in the plane , and they throw the door open , and the one guy says , Hey , I just ca n't go through with this . ' <p> " I decided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that said , I went through the test , but I just ca n't go through with it , ' " he says . <p> Going by the friend count in Felix 's story , there was nobody left in the plane to jump with him . And in fact , at this point in the story , Felix did n't know Kacani was willing to take the plunge with him . Indeed , it was July , and he 'd not even called his friend and former soccer teammate to tell him he was sick . <p> At last , Felix made the call to Richmond . He tried to break the news slowly , easing into the story and struggling with how to tell Kacani . On the other end of the line , 400 miles away , Kacani smiled , not letting on that he not only knew everything , but that he had his own news to share : He 'd turned in his paperwork on July 3 , 2012 , to step into the line as a donor . <p> By September , the news @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his friend on Labor Day , he could hardly contain himself . <p> " I said , Matt , I 'm a match , ' " Kacani recalls . Felix " unaware that his friend had received official word days earlier " cautioned him that one of the test procedures still might disqualify him . But Kacani reassured his friend : " No , really , I 'm a match . " <p> The next few months were a whirlwind . Kacani had to submit to an entirely new battery of testing after Felix decided to switch from Mt . Sinai Hospital to New York Presbyterian Hospital . He 'd heard positive things about a live-donor transplant done there recently between a father and young daughter from his own New Jersey town . <p> Finally , on Nov. 27 , the two men woke in the pre-dawn hours and with their families made their final , chilly trek together to the hospital . <p> " Walking into the hospital , Matt was giving Patrick every opportunity for an out , " Kim Kacani says .

As they did , they snapped a picture of the healthy liver , pink and whole and still nestled in Kacani 's abdomen . <p> The following day , just hours after the surgery , Kenneth Kacani , Patrick 's younger brother , posted a relieved Facebook message to supporters . <p> " My brother Patrick Kacani did something yesterday that no words can accurately describe , " he wrote of the transplant that came with considerable personal risk .

" <p> For his part , Kacani is modest about the act of having given away more than half of his liver to another person . He smiles and suggests it 's the least he could have done under the circumstances . Felix is less inclined to understate the chance his friend took to save him . <p> " Quite frankly , Pat 's the real hero here " he 's the guy that stepped up , " says Felix , becoming quiet when considering whether he would have been so resolute if the operating tables had been turned . " You know , I 've wondered about that , and it 's hard to say . I 'd like to think that I would , but I would n't want to say for sure , because I do n't think that 's the right answer to just say , Yes , I would . ' I think it 'd be a really tough decision . " <p> But regardless , Kim Kacani says , there is no question that it was the right decision for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room , and there are so many stories , " she says . She recalls a woman with cystic fibrosis who had twin daughters and who 'd just received a double-lung transplant that gave her the chance to see them grow up . <p> And then there was the man Pat met in the recovery room . <p> " He was this huge man from the islands with dreadlocks down to the waist , and he was just huge " probably 6-3 or 6-4 , and he donated a kidney , " she says . " He said , You know , I 've known my friend since the third grade . I 've known him for 18 years . ' " <p> The event , Kim says , made her count her blessings . <p> " I think organ donation . People think it 's so commonplace . But people do n't realize how many people are n't registered donors and how long those waiting lists are . " <p> And what of Isaac ? Well , technically , there are two Isaacs now . The one in Kacani @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its original size as of late February . And Felix 's half of Isaac is doing equally well , growing every day and at last providing its host with a chance at a normal life . <p> So why did the Kacanis name Pat 's liver Isaac ? <p> " That very first day when Pat said he was going to do this , we said put that sucker on the altar and let God decide what we 're going to do , " Kim says , referencing a biblical tale of sacrifice . And there 's no doubt Isaac will long be loved by both of his families .

November was a spotter , trained to recognize all aircraft manufactured in Germany , Italy , Japan , France , England , Russia and the United States . <p> " On board ship , I would be in the conning tower , a raised platform , with a talker behind me , holding a telephone that connected to all the guns . When I spotted a plane , I had only seconds to either call for fire or let them pass .

" <p> The boats mounted with charges exploded , while bullets ricocheted off November 's boat , causing splinters to fly . <p> " When we finally got under the point where the Americans could n't lower the guns any more , I heard a man on our ship say , Son of a bitch . He 's one of us !

" When I realized I 'd left my cigarette case at a restaurant , someone asked Neil , who had a car , if he would help retrieve it . Neil 's first words to me were , Goddamn it !

She moved to Augusta , Ga. , completing a bachelor 's degree in biochemistry at the University of Georgia and a medical technology degree at the Medical College of Georgia . She then moved to Florida to be near her sister and to run a medical laboratory . <p> Neil had returned to Richmond after graduating from W&amp;L in 1948 . " He was visiting me in Miami on New Year 's Eve of 1949 , " Sara Belle recalls . " I got a delivery of a gorgeous white orchid from another boy I was dating . The card read , All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but I love the story now ! " <p> Not to be outdone , November showed up the next day with an orchid lei for Sara Belle . <p> " I wore the lei to the Orange Bowl ; everybody thought I was the queen , " Sara Belle remembers with a laugh . " Neil proposed in the stadium , without a ring . He probably thought he had to move quickly to get ahead of Henry . Besides that , he said it would be less expensive to get married than to keep paying for long-distance phone calls . " <p> Prior to the couple 's marriage in 1950 , November had accepted a position with Piedmont Airlines as a co-pilot . <p> " That lasted about 20 minutes , " November recalls . " My father said , You 're coming into the business . ' " <p> The Family Business <p> The business was Friedman-Marks Clothing Co. , known for constructing fine men 's suits . The company had its beginning in New York City 's Brooklyn borough , where November was born in 1924 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , started the business . I understand he had a violent temper . I 'm unsure what happened , but my grandfather was forced out . " <p> November 's father , Israel , born in 1898 , was chosen from among the seven brothers in the family to run the business , necessitating his withdrawal from high school . <p> " My mother , a noted commercial artist , ruined her health staying up all night making illustrations for newspapers , trying to help keep the family afloat . " <p> November 's maternal grandmother took care of him when his mother , Sara D. November , was institutionalized for a few years . <p> " My grandmother was Russian . I understand she had been a seamstress for the tsarina of Russia at one time . She only spoke Yiddish . The only Yiddish I remember is , Nish de keppele . Not the head . ' She always got soap in my eyes when she bathed me . " <p> The Novembers moved to Richmond in 1925 . Israel November had negotiated a partnership with Harry Marks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Friedman and the formation of Friedman-Marks Clothing . " My mother never did forgive my father for not having his name in the business . " <p> Neil 's mother , by then a widely acclaimed artist whose work would be exhibited at the 1939 World 's Fair , was instrumental in developing the Richmond Academy of Arts , the forerunner of the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts . <p> Bill Martin , director of the Valentine Richmond History Center for the past 19 years , had known Neil and Sara Belle November socially , but their friendship blossomed after Martin made a discovery one day in some old files . <p> " What tied us together was an article about Neil 's mother that ran in the Times-Dispatch in 1932. - It was reported that Mrs. Sara D. November received a telegram at the Valentine , while she was teaching an art class , notifying her that her work had been accepted at the Corcoran Gallery of Art in D.C.

" That will be coming to us in the future , but right now we 're also getting a portrait that Neil painted of his mother and some of his childhood paintings , along with some of the sketches and work that Sara D. November did as a graphic designer . " <p> Building Businesses <p> Neil 's father , known as " Izzy , " eventually developed Friedman-Marks into one of the leading manufacturers of dry goods in the nation . At its peak , the company had between 2,000 and 2,500 employees . <p> " I started out making 75 cents an hour as an elevator operator , " November says . " When I became a floor supervisor , my father said no air-conditioned office for me- " - said I should be on the floor so I could be accessible to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> In the mid-1950s , Neil and Sara Belle traveled to Japan on a business venture . <p> " The Japanese wanted to establish a plant to produce Western-style men 's clothing . They selected us because we had a reputation for making the best men 's clothing at the most reasonable prices . I went to organize the plant , although I was reluctant . Only a few years before , I had been shooting at the bastards . We were treated very nicely , except for what they fed me . <p> " Every day for lunch they served the workers huge bowls of vegetables . I wanted some of those vegetables , but they insisted they knew what Americans liked , so they brought me a heaping plate of postage-stamp-size sandwiches . They brought the same heap , getting smaller and smaller , day after day . By the end of my stay , the ones left were as crisp as potato chips .

We built about 400 houses , starting near Willow Lawn and ending up on the South Side , before Ralph took it over completely . " <p> " I always thought they should call themselves the Calendar Boys " May and November , " Sara Belle says with a laugh . " Neil would leave the factory and go to the construction site . When we were young , he worked all the time , " she recalls . " When he was n't working , he was flying . We wanted a family , but when we did n't succeed in having our own children , we adopted Randy in 1956 and Scott in 1958 . However , I ended up raising the boys , took them fishing and to ball games . " <p> In addition to caring for the children , Sara Belle had a 40-year medical career , including lab work for doctors in pioneering surgery at the former Medical College of Virginia . <p> " It was the only job @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she says . " It was the beginning of heart transplants . " <p> Sara Belle 's family history includes a Polish maternal great-grandfather who developed yeast and brought it to America , and a paternal grandfather who developed a successful building supply business that was passed on to her father . Her inherited wealth has significantly supported the couple 's philanthropic endeavors over the years . <p> In Her Honor <p> The Novembers lived together on Richmond 's Riverside Drive for 50 years , but Sara Belle , now 85 , confides that Neil never really " saw " her until they moved to the Westminster Canterbury retirement community . <p> " When we were young , he was either working or flying . That 's how I ended up raising the boys . At one point , I almost left him . " <p> " That was news to me , " Neil quips . " I did n't know anything about that until we were driving downtown one day and she pointed to a place and said , I almost moved there . ' I 'm glad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever loving her more ; in fact , I ca n't keep my hands off of her . " <p> November 's humor is intact , as is his military bearing and commanding voice . He becomes quiet , though , when asked about his philanthropic work and prefers to steer attention to his wife , whom he honored with a billboard over Interstate 64 when she was chosen one of the Richmond YWCA 's Outstanding Women in 2001 . November 's unabashed love for his mate remains apparent , as he names theater after theater in her honor . <p> " I wish he would n't do that . He always keeps it a surprise until it 's already done , " she says with a twinge of embarassment . <p> November just grins , obviously delighted with his covert operations , all the while claiming to have many girlfriends " a running joke Sara Belle both indulges and enjoys . She recounts an incident from last year when Neil was recovering from an attack of transient amnesia . <p> " We were in the hospital room . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started hitting on her . She said , Mr. November , that 's not funny . What 's today 's date ? Who 's the president ? ' When he started flirting with her , I knew he was fine . " <p> Sara Belle 's nonchalance over Neil 's fascination with other women demonstrates her confidence in stature with her husband . She is referred to by more than one acquaintance as the " power behind the throne . " <p> Love for Stage and Sky <p> After Friedman-Marks was sold in 1968 , November stayed for a two-year transition period . In January 1971 , at age 47 , November took his share of the factory sale and began dedicating himself to philanthropic work , which included the theater in a big way . He 's worked closely with Bruce Miller , including when Barksdale Theater and Theatre IV merged to become Virginia Repertory Theatre in 2012 . <p> " I spent years thinking Neil just did n't like me , before realizing that his brutally honest teases were a sign of affection and respect , " Miller @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most caring and generous men I 've ever met . " <p> November reaped the benefits of his investment in an unexpected encounter after a performance at the Empire Theater in 2011 . <p> " We had supported the School of Per-forming Arts in the Richmond Community ( SPARC ) for years , " he remembers . " Allison Gilman , who participated in SPARC as a child , was performing at the Empire . By then , she was in high school . After the play was over and the actors were signing playbills , Allison ran over , threw her arms around my neck and said , Mr. November , I made the big time ! ' I really got a kick out of that . Now she 's off to college , studying theater . " <p> Sara Belle had always loved theater and performed in Pennsylvania and later on several Richmond stages , which led to Neil 's interest in supporting theater , but his enduring love was airplanes . As a boy he spent endless hours designing , building and testing model airplanes with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inventor of the shock tube that enabled hypersonic flight , and Walter " Matt " Jefferies , who designed the original Starship Enterprise used in the legendary TV series Star Trek in 1966 . <p> " Ed Galeski was part of that group , " November adds . " He later flew the B29 during the day and wrote the manual at night , creating the airplane characteristics that ended the war . " <p> November took flight lessons as a teenager at the Hermitage Airport on Laburnum Avenue and washed airplanes , the pilots rewarding him with rides as payment . He earned his license at 16 . <p> " I ca n't ever remember not wanting to fly . The first thing I did after the war was use my discharge pay to buy an Army surplus plane . I knew Sara Belle was the girl for me when she did n't throw up when I took her flying . One girl threw up in my hat . Ruined it . " <p> November 's love for flying led him to help develop the Richmond International Airport in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , named for the Virginia explorer-aviator and admiral . <p> In 1987 , November raised the funds to build the Virginia Aviation Museum , as well as an expansion in 1991. - In 1993 , he was inducted into the Virginia Aviation Hall of Fame . <p> November 's philanthropic credits would fill a book , including chairmanships of the Capital Region Airport Commission , the Science Museum of Virginia , the Virginia Aeronautical Historical Society , and the Virginia Aviation Museum . He served as chairman or president of many other local organizations , and he was instrumental in establishing the Lewis Ginter Botanical Garden . <p> In 1976 , November orchestrated an event called the Israeli Showcase , bringing together hundreds of volunteers to build a replica of Israel , thereby giving city residents an opportunity to experience a plethora of Judaic traditions . Visitors could even insert prayers into a replica of the Western Wall . A daily newspaper article trumpeted the schedule of events , which incorporated other religions in the city as well . <p> The following year , November organized Golden Wings , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transatlantic flight . The show included winged aircraft from the Wright brothers ' flyer to the Concorde . <p> November also helped raise funds for the development of the Virginia Holocaust Museum , established in 1997 . He was the first chairman of the board of directors and remains an honorary trustee . The Neilson J. November Award , bestowed by the museum , is named in his honor . Past recipients have been high-profile figures in the city and state , including former Mayor and Gov. ( and now U.S. Sen. ) Tim Kaine ; Robert and James Ukrop ; and the late Walter Sullivan , who served for 29 years as bishop of the Catholic Diocese of Richmond . <p> Special Moments <p> Although November enjoys working , he treasures the friends he has gathered over a lifetime . <p> Sydnor , president and executive director of the Virginia Holocaust Museum , says , " Among all the things Neil November knows how to do well , creating special moments and unforgettable encounters for his friends is a talent he commands , perhaps better than any other . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lifelong friend . Thalhimer , who served as a Navy pilot in World War II and also as an usher in the Novembers ' wedding , vividly recalls Neil as a daredevil . <p> " We lived a block and a half apart . One of our favorite stunts as teenagers was to tear down the alley on our bikes between Monument and Grace to the garage behind my house . We raced inside the open door , threw on brakes and spun around in a circle , hoping we could stop . A few times we hit the brick wall . We were always taking crazy risks . " <p> The two friends are now part of a group known as the Secret Seven , which is neither secret nor composed of seven members . Membership in the group , originally formed around 1993 , depends on a vote of the 10 members , all male , who gather each week to share lunch . The group does n't allow women as members , based ( they say ) on the men 's salty language . The group @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ financial backing . <p> November is also keenly interested in politics . He has quietly supported Democratic candidates for decades , even escorting former Gov . Gerald Baliles to Israel for fact-finding trips . His efforts paid off with the formation of the Virginia-Israel Commission , developed during the Baliles administration in the late 1980s . Several other agreements were fostered from that effort , setting the stage for ongoing economic ventures between Virginia and Israel . <p> Along with being a close personal friend , Baliles describes November as " a force of nature , a derecho of human energy and a GPS for leadership and results . " <p> Ric Arenstein , managing partner of Arenstein &amp; Associates and formerly a special assistant for Baliles , agrees . " In state government , we were capable of structuring the plan , but it was Neil who sold the governor 's vision for Israel . " <p> Arenstein credits November with helping him and Allison Weinstein in 2002 , when they co-chaired the effort to refurbish and rebuild the Jewish Community Center , now called the Weinstein JCC . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ control , he went off and did something else . For a guy with a giant ego , his ability to separate and let others do what they 're capable of doing is part of his power . " <p> Arenstein says that November 's ego is a virtue . <p> " I think people who make great change do so because they think others are n't as capable . That 's ego , but in the most positive way . I think Neil believes he can do things that nobody else can do , and he does . He 's like a general . Everything is well-thought-out . He sees what it takes and then executes it . " <p> The World Stopped <p> While the Novembers have had many high points in their life together , their world fell apart on June 14 , 2005 , when they learned that their younger son , Scott , had committed suicide . He was 47 and had been a Richmond police officer for 15 years . <p> " He never rose in the ranks because he refused to give anyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Neil offers . " He left a note in my office saying , I hope you 'll understand why I 'm doing this . ' Of course , we never did . " <p> " He was such a good person , " Sara Belle adds softly . " His best friend told me that he takes his lunch to Scott 's grave every week and has lunch with him . We 've been amazed at the stories we 've heard of Scott helping others . " <p> After moving to Westminster Canterbury later in 2005 , the Novembers funded a 300-seat theater there , along with an art gallery in their son 's memory . A portrait of Scott is on permanent display . <p> " We were blessed to have two wonderful boys , " Sara Belle says , " and Randy is still wonderful . His first wife died , and when he remarried , he wanted the service held in the art gallery so he could be near his brother . " <p> While the Novembers remain active and excited about the city 's possibilities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have plenty of theaters . We could do with less graffiti , though , " Sara Belle muses . <p> Neil believes the region lacks specific direction . <p> " We need more sidewalks . The streets need fixing . The potential is there if the right administration takes over , but they seem to be wishy-washy right now . " <p> He also wonders about future generations . " As a member of America 's fast disappearing Greatest Generation , ' I am bitterly disappointed at the apparent decaying of our country since I fought in the Pacific in World War II . " <p> " Summarizing Neil 's legacy reminds me of the inscription on the plaque that covers the grave in which Sir Christopher Wren is interred . It 's in the south wall of the crypt in St. Paul 's Cathedral in London , which Wren designed and built . The inscription notes simply : - Reader , if you would seek his monument , look around you . ' " <p> About 15 years ago , when I told my mother that I was interviewing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over her heart and said , " My Neil November ? " <p> Much to my surprise , I learned that Neil was her floor supervisor when she worked as a seamstress for Friedman-Marks clothing factory , co-owned by Israel November , Neil 's father . In a quiet voice , Mama said , " I 'll tell you one thing . You wo n't find anybody to say anything bad about him . " My mother did n't have a high regard for many males , so to hold Neil in such esteem for some 30 years was a surprise . <p> Neil reminds me of my mother . Like she , Neil always has encouraged me to keep going , exemplifying my mother 's motto for life : " Nothing beats a failure but a try . " He introduced me to Carole Weinstein , who helped me publish Izzy 's Fire , my first book , and he helped to send me on trips to Lithuania and Israel after I received author invitations in both countries as well as to Hollins University for more study . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ write about him and his wife , Sara Belle .

@@59668440 @8668440/ <h> Top High Schools <p> The first row for each school provides the percentage of students who earned pass/advanced on Standards of Learning ( SOL ) tests for 2009-2010 " the equivalent of scoring 90 percent or above . The second row provides the overall SOL pass rate . <p> Considering the abundance of good public high schools in the Richmond region , we decided to profile 13 that we consider to be among the best . We provide snapshots of these schools based on our own and other publications ' considerable reporting . <p> Since both Newsweek and U.S. News &amp; World Report have been in the business of ranking high schools for many years , we took into consideration their research and conclusions . Newsweek rankings are based on the number of students who take Advanced Placement ( AP ) , International Baccalaureate ( IB ) or Cambridge tests , and just getting on the list is an accomplishment " it includes only 6 percent ( 1,600 ) of all the high schools in the nation . Since U.S. News &amp; World Report tries to measure how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are college-bound , the magazine considers math and reading proficiency rates and the number and performance of economically disadvantaged students , as well as AP and IB test scores . <p> But we also went a step further by digging deep into Standard of Learning skills test scores , and here 's why . They are the fulcrums around which much of Virginia 's school system revolves . From first to 12th grades , curriculums are based on SOLs because the percentage of students who pass the SOL tests determines whether schools are accredited by the state . Teachers are trained to teach not only SOL content but also testing strategies . And students ' SOL scores are an important part of their records , consulted if they 're under consideration for magnet schools or gifted and talented programs , and required for graduation . <h> Additional stories <p> While many high schools chase higher test scores , some unprepared graduates crash and burn when they get to college . <p> However , the number of students who simply pass the SOLs is not a strong measure of the quality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ score " as low as 50 percent " and still receive what 's known as a pass/proficient designation . As a result , many educators say that the percentage of students who get pass/advanced " the equivalent of scoring at least 90 percent " is a far better measure . They say that the pass/advanced percentage demonstrates how many students have mastered the material . So we examined pass/advanced scores for all four high school grades when we chose our top schools . See above chart . We picked at least two schools from each of the four metro-area districts for our list , which is not ranked . <h> HANOVER HIGH SCHOOL ( HANOVER ) <p> Attending Hanover High School is a bit like heading off to college . In addition to hosting one of the county 's four high school-level IB programs , the school with more than 1,300 students also serves as Hanover County 's career and technical education college preparatory school . <p> Hanover has a rich offering of post-high school programs created in partnership with local colleges such as J.

Participating students may graduate ready to enter the workforce , with one of various industry certifications , including pharmaceutical or dentistry technician certificates . Pre-engineering classes concentrate on computer science networking or programming , architecture and biotechnology . In another program , students can graduate with licensed practical nurse certifications . <p> " All of these are dual-enrollment , " says principal George Sadler , who notes that some students step into professional careers straight out of high school . He says that others use their Hanover experience " and college credits " as stepping stones toward medical , engineering and other degrees . <h> CLOVER HILL HIGH SCHOOL ( CHESTERFIELD ) <p> Clover Hill principal Deborah Marks says that one of her main goals is to be able to tell parents that when their children are seniors , every course they take will count as credit in the colleges they attend . The school of about 1,600 students offers more than 30 Advanced Placement ( AP ) courses , according to Marks . The emphasis on AP classes is probably what puts Clover Hill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Clover Hill ranked 964 on Newsweek 's list of 1,600 schools . Students also take college courses in math and science that mirror those at John Tyler Community College . <p> Compared with other Chesterfield County schools , Clover Hill does not produce a high percentage of pass/advanced SOL scores . Less than half the students earned pass/advanced in history and English and less than 20 percent got the same in math and science . <p> Marks says some 85 percent to 88 percent of Clover Hill students further their education after they graduate . " Our math and science children go to Yale , Harvard , MIT , Virginia Tech , U.Va. , " she says . <p> This year , Clover Hill , which was located on traffic-clogged Hull Street Road , moved to a new , more tranquil location off Genito Road . <h> COSBY HIGH SCHOOL ( CHESTERFIELD ) <p> Cosby High School principal Brenda Mayo says the school operates on the assumption that young people need a lot more than a high school diploma to get ahead in the world . " We 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough to get the lifestyle you want . ' We 've been asking them , What are you going to do to make the life you want ? ' " <p> To that end , she says , Cosby tries to instill a work ethic in students while dispelling any lingering ideas that getting A 's may not be cool . <p> Cosby is one of a handful of schools in Chesterfield County taking part in an Exxon-funded program to get more students into AP classes by identifying those with potential and channeling them into the advanced courses . " We try to establish that doing your best " is not exceptional but expected , Mayo says . It 's all about being high-achievers " perhaps over-achievers " because even 16-year-olds know that the U.S. job market is getting more competitive . <p> With high parental expectations , Cosby students perform well on standardized tests ; 54.5 percent earned pass/advanced on English SOLs and 62 percent earned pass/advanced in history . Cosby 's magnet school in health sciences accepts about 100 ninth-graders each year . <h> DEEP RUN HIGH SCHOOL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ School is arguably the best of the best . The county 's newest ( for now ) high school is in the heart of Short Pump and reflects the county 's commitment to attracting new businesses and retaining old commerce through workforce development . Placement of the county 's Information Technology magnet school here was no accident . In addition to being the region 's shopping mecca , Short Pump is the location of Henrico 's business district . <p> " But it 's not all about technology , " says principal Lenny Pritchard , who led the school as it has racked up honors ; Deep Run is one of only two schools in the Richmond metro area that made both Newsweek and U.S. News &amp; World Report rankings . ( The other is Henrico 's Mills E. Godwin High School ) " It 's about being able to work in groups . " <p> Deep Run 's Information Technology curriculum evolves to keep students ahead of the curve , most recently incorporating computer security systems and computer game programming . " We bring in groups of local businesses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kids need to know , and how can we prepare them to enter the work force , " Pritchard says . <p> The emphasis on taking teaching beyond state requirements appears to have worked . During the 2009-2010 academic year , Deep Run students were the percentage leader in pass/advanced SOL scores in the region . <h> MIDLOTHIAN HIGH SCHOOL ( CHESTERFIELD ) <p> Midlothian is home to one of Chesterfield County 's International Baccalaureate ( IB ) programs " accelerated , internationally recognized academic courses that Newsweek uses in its ranking . Midlothian 's 120 IB students , who must apply to the program , are among the brightest in Chesterfield . According to assistant principal Kathryn Whitlow , they go to elite colleges " the College of William and Mary , North Carolina 's Duke and Wake Forest universities , and the Ivy League . <p> But students taking regular courses at Midlothian also appear to be learning , even mastering what they should know before graduating .

There are web design courses , and highly ambitious students can try to earn a CISCO certificate , confirming completion of one of the most rigorous information technology training programs in the country . Students can take accounting , marketing and other business courses . <p> Whitlow says Midlothian students perform well " because we have really devoted faculty and high parent expectations . " <h> MILLS . E. GODWIN HIGH SCHOOL ( HENRICO ) <p> Even as Henrico opens newer and shinier high schools , Godwin remains a leader . It is one of only two schools in the Richmond region to make both Newsweek and U.S. News &amp; World Report lists .

Only Deep Run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a priority at Godwin . Students who earn pass/advanced scores are rewarded with certificates of honor that are distributed during a schoolwide October assembly . " It 's great when we 're passing , " Armbruster says . But a high pass/advanced percentage is a more ambitious goal , she says . " We 're striving for the next thing . " <h> MONACAN HIGH SCHOOL ( CHESTERFIELD ) <p> Principal William Broyles says Monacan 's magnet program , the Center for Humanities , shapes the rest of the school 's identity and its teaching . Many of the center 's teachers also teach regular courses , bringing a classical liberal arts approach to those classes . " Teachers use the Socratic method , which requires students to interact , " Broyles says . " We find that our students are very comfortable with group engagements and work because of that setting . " Teachers also integrate humanities into math and the sciences . For example , students learning algebra might also learn where and when the concepts originated . <p> All of this is part of a program @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ message , Broyles says , that he hopes students will carry with them as they go out into the world . <p> Although Monacan is ranked above Cosby High on Newsweek 's list , its SOL scores are slightly lower than most in our list . In the English SOL test , 52 percent of the students achieved pass/advanced while 41 percent earned that level in history . Only about 11 percent of the students earned pass/advanced in their science and math SOLs . <h> OPEN HIGH SCHOOL ( CITY OF RICHMOND ) <p> This year , Richmond 's Open High was once again included in U.S. News &amp; World Report 's list of best high schools . A magnet school of less than 200 students , it takes about 20 percent to 25 percent of those who apply . Open High was awarded the magazine 's Bronze Medal , notable because the publication considered more than 27,000 schools before compiling its top schools list . <p> Principal Candace Veney-Chaplin says Open High uses relationships and relevance to help students perform well . " Sometimes students achieve for a teacher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she says . Teachers focus on putting course content in a " real-world context " so that students understand the point of learning it , she says . For example , a statistics teacher uses the numbers from real political polls . She says that a history instructor teaches from the 20th century backward , so students can more easily relate the contemporary world to the past . The philosophy has been the cornerstone of the school since it was formed in 1972 through the impetus of parents who petitioned the Richmond School Board . <p> Open High also uses experience in the community to teach . A student who wants to be a veterinarian might work for the SPCA , while a student who wants to be a dentist might work as an assistant in a nearby practice . Students are motivated because they 're learning about what they dream of doing , Chaplin says . Virtually all students go on to some form of higher education after they graduate " 80 percent to 85 percent attend four-year universities and most of the rest attend community colleges . <h> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ High School says its specialty program teaches students about leadership and the importance of international relations in an era of globalization , meaning it attracts young people who want to help run the world by working in diplomacy , intelligence , foreign policy and international aid . The rest of James River 's more than 2,000 students are drawn from an unusually diverse population : The school is the county 's English as a Second Language ( ESL ) center . " We have kids who speak Farsi and Urdu , " as well as Spanish and other languages , says principal John Titus . James River 's attendance boundary includes areas where refugee families have been resettled , so the school also has " kids whose parents have been shot by the Taliban , " Titus says . <p> A solid 50.5 percent of James River students earned pass/advanced in English ; 47.3 percent earned pass/advanced in history ; 20 percent earned pass advanced in math , and 16.7 percent in science .

" All four of the county 's high schools offer the same programs , with the exception of the highly specialized career prep center offered at Hanover High School . But , says Cohodas , that does n't stop each high school from being tailor-fit to the community it serves . In Atlee 's case , that community is the affluent central region of the county . " The community - expects our students to go to college and expects our children to become leaders , " Cohodas says . " We have an entire wall dedicated to the pillars of leadership . " <p> Cohodas points out that Atlee has 57 clubs and activities , many of them student-driven and community-outreach focused . " The whole philosophy of learning is tailored around developing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Baccalaureate and Cambridge exams , meeting Newsweek 's criteria . <h> DOUGLAS S. FREEMAN HIGH SCHOOL ( HENRICO ) <p> In the heart of western Henrico County , Douglas S. Freeman High School is a thriving hub of community cohesiveness , even though the area gives way to Short Pump , which increasingly is getting a reputation for being the best place to live and get an education . Even though the population is moving westward , Freeman continues to be among the best schools in the Richmond region . <p> Principal Anne Poates says teachers work to maintain the rigor of the academic program . " I feel like people choose to be here for a lot of the right reasons " because of the success we 've enjoyed as a school , " she says . <p> Freeman hosts Henrico 's Center for Leadership , Government and Global Economics . Its SOL scores are high . Pass/advanced rates exceed those at nearly all other schools in the region ; only Henrico 's Deep Run and Godwin surpassed them in all categories . <h> HENRICO HIGH SCHOOL ( HENRICO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most recent list of top U.S. high school , but that appears to reflect students in the school 's prestigious IB program , a key criterion for Newsweek . The IB program draws some of the county 's brightest students , who must apply to the advanced studies program . It also includes a second specialty school , the Center for the Arts , which likewise draws top students . <p> However , SOL scores for the entire student body do n't reflect high overall performance . Of the schools in our list , Henrico had the lowest SOL pass/advanced . During the 2008-2009 academic year , Henrico reported more dropouts " 98 of them " than any other school in the Richmond metro region . <p> While drawing top students to its specialty programs , Henrico also serves many of the county 's most economically challenged students . Forty-six percent of Henrico students are at or below poverty level . The percentage increased after the recent adoption of school attendance boundaries that drew more poor neighborhoods into Henrico High 's area . <p> " We reach beyond the regular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tutoring programs and Saturday school . " If we extend the day for our students , we 're going to get them where they need to be . " <h> RICHMOND COMMUNITY HIGH SCHOOL ( CITY OF RICHMOND ) <p> Principal J. Austin Brown believes that Richmond Community High has received U.S. News &amp; World Report 's Silver medal for three years in a row because the school has an unusually challenging curriculum . All of the school 's 243 students " 60 percent of whom qualify for free or reduced-fee lunches " must take the school 's advanced study program . From ninth grade on , they take nothing but honors or AP classes . They 're also strongly encouraged to take at least one college course in the field they hope to enter . <p> Brown , who has worked at schools with more standard curriculums , says the question at Community High is " how is to get the child to achieve at an even higher level and how to raise more scholarship money .

We do really enjoy playing and singing together . <p> RM : Are you hoping for your engagement to serve as a political statement , given that Referendum 74 is trying to reverse the same-sex marriage law in Washington state ? <p> BC : It 's definitely not a political thing at all , but I do believe that it 's important , because I have a platform , to make my engagement known and for it to be an open discussion around marriage equality . In this country it 's a civil-rights issue that I feel really passionate about , and I 've felt really passionate about always . <p> RM : Are you planning on delaying your marriage until you can be legally married in Washington ? <p> BC : I 'm not planning on doing that because we 're getting married also in the U.K. We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to be married here . And then when we can be legally married here , we 'll have another party . There 's no reason to limit the amount of parties you can have . <p> RM : Your past two studio albums have been recorded under the supervision of T-Bone Burnett and Rick Rubin , but for this album , you and the band took off the training wheels and recorded the whole thing on your own . How did the unsupervised nature of the recording process play into the childhood nostalgia themes in songs like " Keep Your Heart Young " and " Just Kids " and elsewhere in the album ? <p> BC : Yeah , there 's a lot of that going on . There 's all these kids coming up in my life all the time now . These babies are being born . My brothers and sisters are having them , the band 's bass guitarist Phil 's got one with my sister . There 's a lot of kids around , and there 's a lot of remnants of youth happening between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Phil Hanseroth . We 've always been really childlike .

Also , I turned 30 this year , and I think that could shake anybody 's core viewpoints . So there was a lot of that revisiting of themes and phases of my life for sure . <p> RM : I 've heard that you sometimes like to go fishing when you arrive in a town . Richmond has great fishing on the James River , so if you guys get here early enough , you should check that out . <p> BC : On the James River ? Fishing for what ? <p> RM : I do n't know specifically what they fish for , but I 'm always seeing people out there . <p> BC : Anne , you got ta help me out , you got ta tell me what to use " leeches , worms , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I 'll look into it . I 'll be on Google when I hang up the phone with you . <p> RM : You should . All right , Bear Creek has turned out to be your highest-charting album yet , jumping to No. 10 on the Billboard 200 , 16 spots ahead of your last LP , Give Up the Ghost . What do you think it is about this album that made it stand out and generate such a positive response ? <p> BC : I think that , you know , some of the things we talked about " the raucousness , the innocence , the lack of ordinariness about it . It 's unusual . It bounces around from genre to genre . The sequencing is not very well thought out . It 's got some randomness about it , but so does life , and I find that those kinds of things accompanied with a little bit of imperfection make people relax and listen to the music and enjoy it , because constant perfection and refinement and this kind of seeking of a higher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is great , and we should always try and fine-tune and polish our craft , but perfection is not something that human beings can relate to . I really wanted to make a record that relays that message . <p> RM : I 've heard in some interviews that " That Was n't Me " is a story about addiction recovery , but I 've also heard you say it 's about your return to church . Which of those is correct ? <p> BC : No , it 's definitely not about my return to church . It 's about addiction recovery. - Sometimes in interviews , the message you 're trying to relay does n't come across . The thing I like about it is that you ca n't really tell whether the narrator is singing from the perspective of that they themselves are recovered from addiction or whether it 's a person that 's been impacted by the addict and is kind of speaking in third person about them . It 's kind of cool , because in that way you become a bit of a healing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> RM : Let 's jump to another song then , because my next two questions had to do with churches . <p> BC : It may be that I 've played that song in church a few times , so I may have said that in the interview . I go to church on Sunday , and they asked me to play a song and I played that one . <p> RM : Is it true that you sometimes lead your church in bluegrass spiritual standards ? <p> BC : Yeah , we call it bluegrass mass , but I 've only done that a few times . Recently I did one that was more old , spiritual standards that were on the soul side . I did " Keep Your Eye on the Sparrow , " stuff like that . <p> BC : They clap and sing and stomp their feet .

Laughs . <p> RM : Another theme that runs through the album is this idea of returning home . I 'm thinking specifically of " Hard Way Home " and " What Did I Ever Come Here For . " You 've spent the better half of a decade on the road . Now that you 're in your 30s , are you feeling that tug to set some roots and take time off from touring ? <p> BC : Absolutely , I just felt like I turned 30 , and it spun me around face-to-face with someone who I have n't been for the past 10 years , which is kind of cool because I feel like I 'm becoming reacquainted with my domestic self . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I do n't have that anymore , because I definitely do , but as I return to these places " you mentioned returning themes " over and over again , and I know my favorite spots , I know my favorite restaurants , I know the parks that I walk through , all of these places have a familiarity about them right now . It gives home a bit of an ambiguousness . <p> What had ended up happening is , so many of the people in my family are having kids and taking all these different life changes and turns . A lot of us are turning 30 , actually . I 'm the oldest , so I 'm the first , but everybody 's going to come after me . It 's been a really beautiful thing to cultivate my career and my musicianship in the way that I have for the last 10 years , but there 's part of me that I have n't been cultivating . It 's no longer OK with me to go home at the end of a tour and not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be the only one who 's uncomfortable holding an infant . I really need to confront that .
